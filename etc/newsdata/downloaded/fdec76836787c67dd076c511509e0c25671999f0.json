It won't take much to push them over the edge.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the German economy is teetering on the edge of recession,\" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.\n\nGermany, Britain, Italy, Brazil and Mexico each rank among the world's largest 20 economies. Singapore and Hong Kong , which are smaller but still serve as vital hubs for finance and trade, are also suffering.\n\nWhile growth has been dragged lower in each country by a specific cocktail of factors, a global manufacturing slump and a sharp drop in business confidence have made matters worse.\n\nChina's massive economy is growing at the slowest pace in nearly three decades as the country wages a prolonged trade war with the United States , which will impose new taxes on Chinese exports in September and December.\n\n\"The common feature is the weak global backdrop,\" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.\n\n. It also downgraded its expectations for 2020 to 3.5%. The International Monetary Fund last month cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.2%, the weakest rate of expansion since 2009It also downgraded its expectations for 2020 to 3.5%.\n\nInvestors are increasingly worried. The bond market is flashing warning signs and more than a third of asset managers surveyed by Bank of America expect a global recession in the next 12 months.\n\n5 economies at risk\n\nGermany relies heavily on exporters that sell a disproportionate amount of goods to China and the United States. Lackluster global auto sales have also hit its carmakers.\n\n\"Today's GDP report definitely marks the end of a golden decade for the German economy,\" said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist in Germany at the Dutch bank ING.\n\nA German auto supplier near Berlin in July.\n\nWhile fears of a chaotic Brexit are helping to drag down the German economy, that issue is causing the most pain in the United Kingdom , where the economy is shrinking for the first time since 2012.\n\nThe British economy should rebound in the third quarter and avoid an immediate recession. But if Prime Minister Boris Johnson pulls the country out of the European Union without a deal to protect trade on October 31, a recession would likely be unavoidable.\n\nIn Italy, weak productivity, high youth unemployment, huge debt and political turmoil are to blame for its continued malaise.\n\nInvestment has dropped in Mexico and the country's services sector is under pressure. Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, is suffering from weak industrial production and high unemployment. Data due in the coming weeks will confirm whether it has fallen into recession.\n\nStorm clouds\n\nShearing argues that some of the gloom and doom is unjustified. At a global level, he says, spending by companies on assets such as equipment have stabilized. The labor market is resilient.\n\n\"While there are pockets of extreme weakness in the world economy \u2014 particularly in manufacturing \u2014 other parts are holding up relatively well,\" he said. \"All of this is consistent with our view that global growth is slowing rather than collapsing.\n\nA major iron ore mine in northern Brazil.\n\nYet he also points to three big risks.\n\nThe first is the trade war. If Beijing and Washington continue to ratchet tensions higher, business confidence could plummet. The International Monetary Fund has warned that growth in 2020 would be slashed by half a percentage point if the dispute escalates further.\n\nAnother big risk is that central banks fail to act, causing a negative reaction in financial markets that feeds through to the real economy. The US Federal Reserve cut rates last month for the first time in 11 years, and the European Central Bank has hinted that it will unleash more stimulus in September. Pressure is building on China to cut its main interest rate for the first time in four years.\n\nOther central banks from India to Thailand have slashed rates, and more cuts are expected.\n\nThe final risk is that the global services sector, which has supported growth, begins to mirror the downturn seen in manufacturing.", "description": "Five big economies are at risk of recession.
