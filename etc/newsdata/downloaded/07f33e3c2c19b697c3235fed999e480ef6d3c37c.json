UK banks question EU access after Brexit", "language": "en", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Direct access to the European Union after Brexit may not be worth the cost if Britain has to align itself with EU rules covering only a narrow range of activity, financial industry officials have said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Canary Wharf and the City of London financial district are seen from an aerial view in London, Britain, August 8, 2019. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nThe UK financial sector\u2019s single biggest customer is the EU and it currently enjoys \u201cpassporting\u201d or unfettered access to the bloc. But this will end after Britain exits the bloc.\n\nFuture trade will be based on \u201cequivalence\u201d, the EU\u2019s system of access to foreign firms that Brussels deems to have home rules as strict as those in the bloc.\n\n\u201cThe UK will be the most equivalent country in the world,\u201d Nausicaa Delfas, executive director international at Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, told Reuters on Monday.\n\nShe urged Brussels to take a technical and not a political approach to determining UK equivalence.\n\nEquivalence-based EU access amounts to 5-10% of cross-border business under passporting, and Britain wants Brussels to \u201cenhance\u201d the system to make it more predictable and transparent.\n\nThis could include a \u201cmechanism\u201d to deal with any divergence in rules as Britain does not want to become a permanent \u201ctaker\u201d of EU regulations.\n\nAntony Manchester, a managing director at BlackRock, said weighing up the advantages of equivalence would be easier for Britain if the EU were to enhance it.\n\n\u201cOtherwise you end up with a situation where it\u2019s all or nothing,\u201d Manchester told a City & Financial conference on Brexit. \u201cI hope that the reality of interdependence creeps in... otherwise you end up with closed European markets.\u201d\n\nOver 300 banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain have opened EU hubs to serve their customers directly from inside the bloc, which limits the usefulness of Britain pushing hard for equivalence.\n\nAMBITIOUS\n\nThe UK financial sector proposed a broader and novel \u201cmutual recognition\u201d approach two years ago, whereby the UK and EU would agree to accept each others\u2019 rules. But the EU shot it down - believing Britain should not enjoy the same privileges outside the bloc as it did inside.\n\n\u201cAsking the EU to change equivalence is actually equally ambitious as the mutual recognition model,\u201d said Conor Lawlor, director of Brexit policy at UK Finance, a banking body.\n\nJon Whitehouse, group head of government relations at Barclays bank, said that how quickly or willing the EU might be to change equivalence is a \u201cbig question\u201d.\n\nBut the question should be whether Britain wants equivalence in the first place, and whether its cost outweighs the benefits, according to Alexandria Carr, head of European regulatory change at HSBC.\n\n\u201cThe cost can be great and the direction of travel is increasing the cost of equivalence,\u201d Carr said.\n\nBrexit has prompted the EU to toughen up equivalence conditions for foreign clearing houses and for foreign investment firms, with EU supervision now becoming part and parcel of determinations.\n\nLawlor said it was also unclear how Britain will reconcile meaningful EU market access with not wanting to become an EU rule taker.\n\n\u201cThere is a direct correlation between regulatory autonomy and market access. The more you have of one, the less you have of the other,\u201d he said.\n\nBritain\u2019s financial services minister John Glen told the conference he wanted an \u201cagile\u201d regulatory approach and that Britain was weighing up equivalence in key areas \u201cvery carefully\u201d.", "description": "Direct access to the European Union after Brexit may not be worth the cost if Britain has to align itself with EU rules covering only a narrow range of activity, financial industry officials have said.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445904385&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1AH", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
