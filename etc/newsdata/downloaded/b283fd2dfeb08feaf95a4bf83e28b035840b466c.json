Never in its short history had it weighed such a momentous case. And never had Britons been treated to so many modern trappings at a core establishment institution.\n\nUnlike other British courts, Hale and her fellow judges do not wear wigs nor do they sit in an elevated position.\n\nWhile TV cameras are barred from nearly all other tribunals, the Supreme Court's live stream on the first day of the hearing was accessed on its website more than 4 million times.\n\nThrust into the Brexit maelstrom, Hale insisted her court was determining points of law, not politics.\n\n\"I must repeat that this case is not about when or on what terms the United Kingdom leaves the European Union,\" she told the court as hearings finished last Thursday.\n\nOn Tuesday, it ruled that Johnson had acted unlawfully by asking Queen Elizabeth to suspend parliament for five weeks in order, as his foes allege, to sidestep opposition to his plan to take Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal by Oct. 31.\n\nReading out the ruling in a clear, unwavering voice, Hale offered not a shred of comfort to the beleaguered prime minister.\n\n\"No justification for taking action with such an extreme effect has been put before the court, she said. \"....the Prime Minister's advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect.\"\n\nLEGAL PIONEER\n\nHale, 74, became Supreme Court president two years ago and is emblematic of its modern face.\n\nUnlike most contemporaries, she was brought up in northern England and educated at a state school, was an academic lawyer specialising in family and welfare issues, and spent most of her career as a pioneer in her field.\n\nShe became a High Court judge in 1994 and Britain's first female law lord in 2004 - until recently the top court's only woman. Last year, she made a brief appearance on a TV cooking show MasterChef.\n\nIn a speech in May at Girton College, Cambridge, which she attended in the 1960s, graduating top of her class, she said a former senior judge had described her in his diaries as \"a formidable, vigorous person with a strong agenda of her own\".\n\n\"What is this \u2018Brenda agenda\u2019 and why should voicing it arouse such feelings? It is, quite simply, the belief that women are equal to men and should enjoy the same rights and freedoms that they do,\" she said.\n\n\"So why is that \u2018an agenda\u2019? Quite simply, because we have not yet achieved the equality we seek in the law, let alone in life.\"\n\nNot shy about promoting equal rights for women and greater diversity in the judiciary, Hale's reforms of divorce and child law have led to her being singled out.\n\n\"The Marriage Wrecker\", one Daily Mail columnist described her as in a 2003 article, criticising her views on gay partnerships, heterosexual cohabitation and divorce.\n\nPIVOTAL TO FUTURE\n\nAs well as having a huge impact on how Brexit plays out with the Oct. 31 divorce deadline looming, the court's ruling will also be pivotal in determining the future balance of power between Britain's government and parliament.\n\nBrexit-supporter Johnson, a former London mayor known for his mop of blond hair and bombastic rhetoric, advised the 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth on Aug. 28 to prorogue - UK parlance for suspend - parliament.\n\nThe shutdown came into effect on Sept. 10 amid chaotic protests by opposition lawmakers in the lower House of Commons on the banks of London's River Thames.\n\nSifting through legal precedence from cases and laws dating back hundreds of years, Johnson's team argued judges should not interfere in politics and limit the prime minister's use of prerogative powers - functions he carries out in the monarch's name.\n\nWhen the courts in 2016 last trod into matters of such constitutional significance - whether the government needed parliament's approval before triggering the formal EU divorce process - they drew the ire of Brexit-supporting newspapers.\n\n\"Enemies of the People,\" said the Daily Mail headline above a photograph of three senior High Court judges after they ruled parliament's approval was needed.\n\nThis time, it was Lady Hale - and her brooch - that lit up social media.", "description": "The Supreme Court head who delivered historic ruling with spider's lethal bite", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8N1CH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
