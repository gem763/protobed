He struggled against the human hands pinning down his flippers. He endured a biopsy and was affixed with a metal tag. When the researchers noticed an object obstructing his left nostril, they came at him with good intentions and a pair of pliers.\n\nChristine Figgener, a marine biology grad student aboard the boat, filmed with her phone as a colleague tried to yank some sort of tube from the turtle\u2019s nose. At first, Figgener thought it might be a worm. Then she saw it was a piece of plastic. \u201cIs that a freaking straw?\u201d she exclaimed, outrage blooming in her voice. Indeed, it was. In time, the straw was plucked from the turtle\u2019s nose and the sad, green fellow liberated. But Figgener\u2014who\u2019d been researching turtle behavior in pursuit of her Ph.D. and had seen marine life tormented by plastic junk countless times before\u2014could not stop fuming as the boat returned to shore. It was, if you will, the last straw.\n\n\u201cI remember my mind racing about what to do with this video,\u201d Figgener told me when I spoke to her recently. \u201cBecause I remember feeling it was evidence that I couldn\u2019t keep to myself. I also didn\u2019t want to shoulder it by myself anymore. Other people can sleep soundly every night because they don\u2019t have to see that.\u201d She uploaded the clip to her little-used YouTube channel. The next evening, after hours out on the boat, she logged back on to discover the post had racked up 20,000 views. Another couple of days and it was half a million. Now, four years later, her video has been watched more than 37 million times.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why this short film went viral. For one, the turtle is a star. His large, friendly eyes wince in pain as the straw is extracted. His suffering is steeped in ancient, reptilian nobility. There\u2019s also narrative tension: What is that object? Will they get it out of him? And then the horrifying reveal: Gasp, a plastic straw! Coupled with Figgener\u2019s irate, ad-libbed narration, it\u2019s a compelling document. The path from slurping a Diet Mountain Dew to injuring a sea turtle has never been more succinctly captured.\n\nTo the Make Straws Great Again crowd, paper straws are a symbol of the liberal nanny state run amok.\n\nBut the video didn\u2019t just get clicks. It inspired an uprising. In the years since Figgener filmed that agonized turtle, plastic straw restrictions have passed in Seattle, D.C., California, and England, to name just a few places. More straw laws\u2014it\u2019s hard to keep track of them all\u2014are working their way through municipalities across the country and the world. Major companies like Starbucks, Whole Foods, and Disney have vowed to cut plastic straws from their corporate diets. In many bars and restaurants, you now need to make a special request to get a straw, and when it\u2019s grudgingly trotted out, it\u2019s made of paper, or hay, or avocado seeds. \u201cIt was the beginning of an interesting movement,\u201d says Figgener of her video. \u201cNowadays, that turtle is a poster child.\u201d\n\nStraw activists argue that the best thing for the environment would be to cut out straws altogether. But if you\u2019ve got to use one, they say, at least make it paper. Unlike plastic straws, which can sit in landfills and oceans for hundreds of years, paper straws biodegrade as quickly as a couple of months after they\u2019re discarded. That means they won\u2019t become part of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, or wash up in clumps on beaches, or, yes, injure charismatic animals. And switching to paper does make a lot of sense\u2014until you\u2019re trying to suck a ginger ale through a cardboard straw that collapses into mush the moment it meets your lips.\n\nIn part because of how rapidly the plastic straw went from normal object to Not OK, and in part because of how shoddy some of the paper replacements have been, the right has turned straws into a new front in America\u2019s culture war. To the Make Straws Great Again crowd, paper straws are a symbol of the liberal nanny state run amok. Or, as a Sept. 9 Trump campaign email put it:\n\nThe Democrats have shown that there is truly no limit to how far left they will go in their climate crusade. In addition to other countless liberal ideas, they\u2019ve publicly stated they want to BAN STRAWS\u2014can you believe it? Their answer to everything is MORE government control and LESS individual freedom. They want to control every aspect of YOUR life\u2014and banning straws is only the beginning. President Trump wants to send them a message, so he\u2019s calling on EVERY AMERICAN PATRIOT to get their Official Trump Straws, to show the Democrats that AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST NATION.\n\nThe email links to the campaign\u2019s merch page, where a pack of 10 red plastic straws goes for $15. After a similarly heated July email (\u201cMuch like most liberal ideas, paper straws don\u2019t work and they fall apart instantly\u201d), sales of these straws reportedly earned the campaign $670,000 in one month.\n\nPeople in the straw game point to Figgener\u2019s viral video as a detonator that\u2019s exploded their little corner of the food packaging sector.\n\nIt makes sense that Donald Trump\u2019s minions identified profit opportunity lurking in all the straw chaos. Because once you set aside the political posturing, the internet takes, and, not for nothing, the potential reduction in single-use debris fouling our waterways, this turns into a business story. The most tangible result of straw activism has been upheaval in the straw industry.\n\nPeople in the straw game point to Figgener\u2019s video as a detonator that\u2019s exploded their little corner of the food packaging and accessories sector. Companies that were already making paper straws have seen sales rocket, while new startups have appeared from nowhere to meet the rising demand (and deal with that mush problem). Meanwhile, manufacturers of plastic straws seem, in the long term, screwed. An executive at Dart Container (you might know them as the people who make Solo cups, but they\u2019ve also been a major plastic straw manufacturer) told me that the company, seeing the writing on the wall, opted in April to stop making straws. Instead, Dart has developed a strawless lid\u2014a sort of sippy-cup top\u2014that it hopes will obviate the need for straws entirely.\n\nBasically, the global market for stuff that helps you drink liquid without spilling is now in disarray. And anyone who makes plastic products is wondering: What\u2019s getting canceled next?\n\nOnce upon a time, straws were made of \u2026 straw. Or, more accurately, hollow stalks of rye grass. They tended to dissolve in liquid and imparted a flavor to beverages. In 1888, a man named Marvin Stone invented the paper straw. It was a huge improvement and eventually dominated the market. Then came the plastics explosion. Plastic straws didn\u2019t wither and could survive an inadvertent bending. The mid-20th-century advent of plastic straws made paper straws nearly obsolete.\n\nThe paper straw biz became a sleepy cul-de-sac populated mostly by Chinese companies manufacturing straws of dubious quality from dubious materials. Paper straws are harder to make than plastic straws because you need to braid and glue together layers of paper at precise tension instead of just melting some plastic nurdles and extruding them into a tube shape. So, given a widespread feeling that plastic straws worked great, and a general lack of concern about plastic pollution, the market for paper straws was, for a long time, limited.\n\nThere did exist at least one high-end, American paper straw manufacturer. The Indiana-based Aardvark Straws can actually trace its corporate lineage back to Marvin Stone, the paper straw\u2019s inventor. Pre\u2013turtle video, Aardvark catered primarily to people who wanted patterns or logos printed on their straws, because that\u2019s easier to do on paper than on plastic.\n\nThen, last year, when the plastic straw bans hit, Aardvark\u2019s sales quintupled. By August 2018, having suddenly and miraculously transformed into a hot property, Aardvark found itself acquired by a much larger Wisconsin company called Hoffmaster Group, which in turn is owned by a New York private equity firm called Wellspring Capital Management. An influx of investment allowed Aardvark to ramp up production, and it is now at eight times the capacity it was a year ago. That\u2019s still not enough to keep up with the gush of orders from restaurants scrambling to comply with new straw laws and norms. A bunch of opportunistic entrepreneurs have leapt in to grab the overflow business.\n\nAmong these entrepreneurs is 33-year-old Brent Ohlendorf, the chief operating officer of OK Straw, which launched last year. OK makes its paper straws in China, but, says Ohlendorf, these are premium straws constructed with top-shelf, Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved papers and glues. When customers want to contact a rep, they needn\u2019t send an email to a Mandarin speaker on the other side of the world because\u2014as I discovered when I first called the company\u2019s main number\u2014 they can get Ohlendorf, picking up with a cheery greeting, on the phone in California. \u201cService as strong as the straw\u201d is his motto. The business model is Chinese manufacturing costs, American imprimatur.\n\nOhlendorf\u2019s partner is a 54-year-old Chinese man named Jiang Jingchun who\u2019d previously made most of his money exporting silica. They met because Jiang owns a house in the San Diego suburbs next door to Ohlendorf\u2019s cousin. In the spring of last year, sensing that legislation against plastic straws was gathering momentum, they hatched a plan. They quickly established a 30-employee paper straw factory in southern China. Then they opened a distribution center, about the size of a two-car garage, in a light industrial park in northern San Diego. When I visited, it was just Ohlendorf, Jiang, Jiang\u2019s 23-year-old son Jackson (who referenced the turtle video and called it \u201creally emotional\u201d), and two other employees. This was the sum of their U.S. workforce. All five men were wearing matching green OK Straw T-shirts.\n\nAs we discussed the ins and outs of food-grade materials and wholesale restaurant supply, the OK Straw team pressed some of its paper straw products into my hands. There was the top-of-the-line, four-ply \u201csteakhouse\u201d straw they consider their flagship. (Older-generation Chinese paper straws were two-ply, and even good paper straws are often only three-ply.) There was their fast-selling boba tea straw, with a wide mouth for sucking up tapioca pearls and a pointy tip for stabbing through cup lids. (Ohlendorf says the plentiful boba tea shops in San Francisco got desperate when that city\u2019s ban took effect in July, as there were few existing nonplastic alternatives that met boba specs.) They also had an articulated paper straw that can bend 180 degrees. They view this one as a natural for attaching to the backs of juice boxes. All these were developed within the past 12 months, in a rush to identify customer needs.\n\nOhlendorf couldn\u2019t help but chuckle when he saw news reports about the Trump campaign\u2019s plastic straw gambit. First, there was the absurd price: $15 for a 10-pack, or $1.50 a straw. OK will sell you straws for under a penny per if you buy in bulk. But even more comical to Ohlendorf was the fact that OK has provided paper straws to the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. \u201cHis campaign says paper straws don\u2019t work, but his hotel is buying them,\u201d Ohlendorf said. He added that the Trump hotel is late on its payment.\n\n\u201cHis campaign says paper straws don\u2019t work, but his hotel is buying them.\u201d \u2014 Brent Ohlendorf\n\nWhile OK Straw will likely take a hit from Trump\u2019s trade war\u2014Ohlendorf thinks the tariffs to import their straws from China could increase to 30 percent in October\u2014up the coast in Los Angeles, a couple of other nimble straw founders are avoiding import tariffs altogether by manufacturing in the United States. Morgan Kelle, 27, and Lyne Kelle, 25, are a brother-sister team that also took a look at the 2018 straw bans and determined there was money to be made. They launched their company, US Paper Straw, after finding factory space in a quiet neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nOn a recent sunny morning, the Kelles walked me around their gleaming manufacturing floor, where there were separate machines to make paper straws and to print color images on them. Workers guided piles of finished straws into cardboard boxes for shipping\u201410,000 straws in each case. \u201cWe believe in U.S. manufacturing,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cPeople have a bad idea of the quality of paper straws because of products from China, where they\u2019re using very bad materials.\u201d\n\nThe Kelle siblings, who grew up in France before moving to Canada and then the U.S., got their professional starts working for their family\u2019s real estate development business. When I visited them, their beaming mother sat in on our interview\u2014to her children\u2019s mild embarrassment. Watching these extremely fresh-faced Gen Yers explain to me that they decided to start a straw company a year ago, are now making 25 million straws a week, and will soon be moving into a larger space to expand operations, I confess I began to wonder \u2026 should I be manufacturing paper straws too?\n\nI began to wonder \u2026 should I be manufacturing paper straws too?\n\nIt\u2019s tough to get reliable figures on the size of the U.S. straw market, as many of the companies involved are privately held. One widely propagated stat\u2014attesting that Americans use 500 million straws each day\u2014turned out to have been an educated guess from a 9-year-old. When I asked the market research firm the Freedonia Group for its best estimate, its \u201cpolymers group leader\u201d told me that Americans used approximately 120 billion straws in 2018, or about 329 million straws per day. (That\u2019s almost exactly a straw per day for every person in the country.) The overall straw market is very likely shrinking, as more bars and restaurants provide straws only upon request. But paper straws\u2014which likely make up less than 10 percent of all straw sales right now, according to paper straw executives\u2014will surely continue to consume a bigger and bigger slice of that diminishing pie.\n\nThe paper straw\u2013makers I spoke to were selling basic models at anywhere from less than 1 cent up to 1\u00bd cents per straw. If we settle on a penny-per-straw average to make it easy, and speculate that Americans might soon be using 50 million paper straws a day, by my math that\u2019s $183 million in annual revenue sitting there to fight over. These favorable market conditions rely, of course, on the notion that legislative killshots will continue to target plastic. Which, for now, seems like a good bet.\n\nRafael Espinal first heard of Seattle\u2019s straw ban \u201cliterally when I read it in the New York Times,\u201d he said as he sipped a cold brew at a Brooklyn restaurant, stirring his ice with a straw made of hay. He was wearing jeans rolled up past his ankles and sneakers with no visible socks beneath. \u201cThat\u2019s when I got the idea,\u201d he said.\n\nEspinal is a 35-year-old New York City Council member, representing parts of Brooklyn that include Bushwick and Cypress Hills. He\u2019s already passed a bill requiring \u201cgreen roofs\u201d\u2014vegetation, solar panels, wind turbines\u2014on every new or substantially renovated roof in the city. Now he\u2019s going after plastic straws. Last year, Espinal introduced a bill that would ban them from all city establishments. Actor Adrian Grenier (best known as the handsome guy from Entourage, now refashioning himself as an anti-plastic activist) testified in support of it.\n\nEspinal thinks the bill will pass by the end of this year. I asked him if there are enough paper straws to meet the gargantuan demand that will be birthed when America\u2019s largest city ditches all its plastic straws at once. \u201cIt was actually an issue last year,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen restaurants were moving voluntarily to paper straws. Business owners told me that paper straws were back-ordered for months. But I haven\u2019t heard any concerns about that lately. And you have other alternatives now, like these.\u201d He held up the hay straw from his drink. It snapped with a brittle crack as he spun it around to show me. \u201cI think I just broke it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they work really well. They don\u2019t impart any taste.\u201d\n\nThe opposition to straw bans like Espinal\u2019s tends to fall into a few main categories. The first, and most unassailable, objection comes from disability advocates. There are lots of disabled people who need straws to drink, and they find that plastic straws work best for their purposes. Several people with disabilities testified at the hearing for Espinal\u2019s straw bill, and Espinal says he\u2019s working up an amendment to make sure their needs are recognized.\n\nRestaurant owners are another group that doesn\u2019t universally love plastic straw bans, for a simple reason: They can buy plastic straws cheaper than paper straws. That price difference is decreasing, though, as more paper straw manufacturers enter the market.\n\nSome on the left argue that plastic straw bans are an insufficient distraction. That a single-use product made of paper is bad, too, and that the proper solution is to reduce general consumption. Which, fair enough. The counterarguments here: 1) People aren\u2019t going to stop using single-use stuff anytime soon, so we might as well make the single-use stuff they use less harmful. 2) Straw bans are a good early step and a useful test case, preparing us for more meaningful reforms to come.\n\nPerhaps the most widespread pushback on plastic straw bans comes from those who just prefer plastic straws and think other kinds of straws, for lack of a better verb, suck. These critiques come from both sides of the aisle. Asked about straws at a recent CNN town hall, Kamala Harris said she supports plastic straw bans, but noted, \u201cI\u2019m gonna be honest, it\u2019s really difficult to drink out of a paper straw. Like if you don\u2019t gulp it down immediately, it starts to bend. So we gotta perfect that one a little bit more. \u2026 Innovation is a process.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve encountered this sentiment all over the place. And indeed, there\u2019s no doubt that the old Chinese paper straws didn\u2019t work right. They were loosely wound and could easily unwrap into useless cardboard spirals. They would occasionally, I\u2019ve been told, foam when they contacted liquid. This created a perception about paper straws that, as American paper straw manufacturers will concede, has been hard to shake.\n\nOther straw alternatives have problems too. Hay straws snap. Reusable metal straws can literally impale and kill you. There are straws made from cornstarch that claim to be compostable, but unless they\u2019re handled by a specialized facility, they act like regular plastic. I once tried a straw made from avocado seeds that started to come apart in my hand before it even got wet.\n\nBut when it comes to the newest generation of paper straws, concerns about quality are outdated. In the course of reporting this story, I tried the best new paper straws on offer and discovered they are hefty, strong, and durable\u2014meaning the straw stays intact for the 45 minutes it takes a normal person to nurse a brunchtime iced coffee. The new straws have decent \u201clip feel,\u201d as they say in the business, so your tongue won\u2019t taste the paper and the straw won\u2019t stick to your mouth. Paper straws have gotten markedly better as the market for them has grown and as eager new manufacturers compete with each other to make a superior product. I have no doubt paper straws will keep improving in the years ahead.\n\nOne of the complaints I heard about paper straw quality came from Rafael Espinal\u2019s New York City Council colleague, Joseph Borelli. Borelli, 37, is a Republican who represents Staten Island\u2019s South Shore. He says Espinal is \u201cvery well-intentioned,\u201d but he told me that if the straw bill comes to the floor, Borelli expects he\u2019ll vote against it. \u201cHave you ever used one of these paper straws?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey come apart. It\u2019s an inferior product. They don\u2019t get the job done.\u201d\n\nI get the sense, though, that Borelli\u2019s objection isn\u2019t just about lip feel. It\u2019s more that he resents taking orders from what he calls \u201cthe hyper-environmentalist Left.\u201d Borelli makes frequent appearances on Fox News, the network where host Laura Ingraham recently pretended, in a bizarre bit of performance art, to suck a red-blooded American steak through a God-fearing plastic straw. On the right, plastic straw pride is partly a knee-jerk response to being told what to do by elitist technocrats (akin to the response when former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed limits on the portion size of sugary drinks) and partly a terrific opportunity to own the libs (akin to rolling coal). It\u2019s not hard to imagine outsize novelty plastic straws all over the GOP convention floor come summer 2020.\n\n\u201cI do think we have bigger problems than plastic straws,\u201d said Trump in July. \u201cSo you have a little straw, but what about the plates, the wrappers, and everything else that are much bigger and they\u2019re made of the same material?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m loath to admit it, but the president raises a fair point. We do have bigger problems than plastic straws.\n\nA plastic straw, being smaller, indeed uses less plastic than a plastic plate or a plastic cup. It\u2019s also true that plastic straws are responsible for only a teensy fraction of our marine debris problem. (The major culprit there is discarded fishing gear.) But the straw also happens to be a particularly pernicious piece of garbage. According to that polymer expert I talked to, it\u2019s more difficult to recycle straws than it is to recycle plates and cups. That\u2019s because straws are small and light and fly around easily, so they often escape before they reach the recycling machine. Even when they do get there, the machines have trouble dealing with them. Plates and cups are more likely to get processed.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, though, these distinctions do become a bit silly. Only 9 percent of all plastic ever gets recycled, according to a peer-reviewed study in the journal Science Advances. There\u2019s an overwhelming chance that a plastic item will end up in a landfill or a waterway, whether it\u2019s a straw, a cup, a plate, a spork, or something else. This is partly because our municipal waste management services aren\u2019t up to the gargantuan task of dealing with America\u2019s garbage (a problem that\u2019s only going to get worse as China refuses to take our trash off our hands) and partly because consumers (when we aren\u2019t littering) don\u2019t separate our recyclables with adequate care. Either way, the upshot is that unfathomable amounts of plastic get out into the wild every day and then sit there for centuries\u2014breaking into ever-smaller pieces of microplastic and eventually turning up in our food, our bodies, and anywhere else you can imagine. Which means that most things that we make out of plastic right now ought to, if we can\u2019t stop making them entirely, be made of something else. Something that doesn\u2019t live forever.\n\nTroy Swope is CEO of a company called Footprint that hopes to create workable alternatives for every plastic item under the sun. I got a tour of Footprint\u2019s headquarters in Arizona. It\u2019s an enormous building the size of a few city blocks, and it features an on-site metrology lab, a prototyping station, and a toolmaking shop, in addition to its manufacturing floors and warehouse areas. (The Kelle siblings\u2019 entire US Paper Straw operation would fit in the space where Footprint keeps its foosball table and employee cafe.)\n\nLeft to right: Footprint paper straw, Aardvark flexible paper straw with sea turtle motif, OK Straw paper straw with dolphin motif, Footprint paper straw, OK Straw boba tea straw. Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Seth Stevenson.\n\nSwope got his start as an engineer at Intel, working on the plastic packaging that surrounds expensive microprocessor parts. \u201cAt Intel, we were using the most expensive plastic in the world,\u201d said Swope. \u201cIt was designed not to outgas\u201d\u2014to leach chemicals\u2014\u201cbut it still did. And then one day, I was looking at the plastic wrap around the organic vegetables my wife bought at the grocery store. And I thought, That\u2019s some of the cheapest plastic in the world, and we\u2019re putting it all over our food.\u201d\n\nFootprint makes paper straws that Swope is proud of (he boasts about their \u201choop strength\u201d and \u201cabsorption\u201d), and the company now supplies all the paper straws at Whole Foods and says it\u2019s in the running to eventually supply Starbucks too. But Footprint doesn\u2019t stop at straws. It\u2019s working on other nonplastic food packaging solutions: yogurt cups, microwaveable meal bowls, disposable utensils, those little flat trays that hold supermarket meat, even six-pack rings (the ones we used to snip so they wouldn\u2019t choke the seals).\n\nFootprint makes all these out of a material called molded fiber, which is derived from recycled paper and cardboard. Swope says it\u2019s strong, won\u2019t leak oils, and stands up to oven temperatures, but still degrades harmlessly after it\u2019s thrown away. (Footprint\u2019s molded fiber does not contain the PFAS that were in the fiber bowls that recently earned Chipotle and Sweetgreen the ire of some food safety activists. That story does highlight the danger that, in a rush to swap out a bad thing, we might introduce some problems with a new thing.)\n\n\u201cGrocery stores are where the massive volume in single-use plastics is,\u201d said Swope. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we need to be.\u201d But he considers this merely a starting point. In time, he thinks Footprint could make nonplastic versions of things like disposable razors or credit cards.\n\nRecently, Footprint brought aboard turtle filmmaker Christine Figgener as a sort of ambassador and has begun sponsoring her research. It\u2019s nice of them to fund studies of turtle behavior. But it\u2019s also a canny marketing move\u2014and a pretty good snapshot of where we are in the anti-plastics movement. Swope\u2019s mission to exterminate plastic is a noble goal, but it is also, not incidentally, very much in his business interest. He told me an initial public offering might be in Footprint\u2019s future \u201cif the market is right.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, you can expect more heart-tugging images of plastic-beset animals and of beaches smothered in plastic trash. The movement against plastic will accelerate. The politics will polarize further. And along the way, some people will make a lot of money. Which isn\u2019t necessarily bad. Republicans might shout about paper straw socialism, but in fact what we\u2019re seeing in this case study is well-regulated capitalism hard at work.", "description": "And the rush to get rich off what\u2019s next.", "authors": ["Seth Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/50d54896-5816-4379-a20b-e9598a23bfa8.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=2625x1750&offset=432x0", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
