(SANA/Handout via Reuters)\n\nMazloum Abdi, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces, told Bloomberg in a phone interview Thursday that, without U.S. support, the Kurds may turn to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to help resist recent Turkish offensives in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cIf our allies do not stop this catastrophe to our people, the situation will become worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI think an alliance with Assad could happen. If we get to this point, where we are hopeless.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump announced on Monday that U.S. troops would withdraw from northeast Syria, a move followed by an invasion of the area by Turkey. The Turkish government plans to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria to resettle Syrian refugees who fled their country\u2019s civil war, as well as to fight the Kurdish YPG, which it considers a terrorist organization.\n\nThe SDF, which has said it has lost more than 10,000 fighters in the war against the Islamic State, warned in a statement Monday that with Turkey invading, it would be forced to divert forces from operations against ISIS in the south, destroying \u201call that has been achieved in terms of stability over the last years.\u201d\n\nThe SDF has over 11,000 ISIS prisoners in custody.
