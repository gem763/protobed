Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), \u201care intentionally done to rile up the racist instincts of a portion of his base,\u201d said Dylan Williams, of the left-leaning pro-Israel group J Street. \u201cThis double standard that\u2019s being applied to these congresswomen is very clear, and it\u2019s not a standard that has been applied to other congressional critics of Israeli policy and the occupation.\u201d Omar, who is Black, Muslim and an immigrant from Somalia, represents \u201ca perfect storm of characteristics that they could try to attack and portray as the problem to a white evangelical base,\u201d said Yousef Munayyer, the executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights.\n\n\u201cRep. McCollum,\u201d Munayyer added, \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the poster.\u201d\n\nMcCollum, who grew up in south St. Paul, trained as a social studies teacher. After she graduated, she had a hard time finding full-time work, so she took on long-term substitute teaching jobs and worked part time at Sears. In 1984, McCollumn\u2019s toddler daughter fractured her skull falling off a playground slide that didn\u2019t have enough sand at its base. The girl recovered quickly, but the city didn\u2019t do anything about the playground until after McCollum pushed for it at a City Council meeting \u2014 a victory that prompted her to run for local office. She served on the City Council and in the Minnesota statehouse before she was elected to Congress in 2000.", "description": "", "authors": ["Huffpost.Com Entry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
