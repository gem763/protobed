A spokesman for the Electoral Administration Technical Secretariat did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nTwo-thirds of polling stations have been processed, representing just over 36% of the more than 13 million potential ballots from registered voters, according to data on the electoral commission\u2019s website, which has barely changed since Sunday.\n\nSo far, Nyusi has taken 74.6% of the presidential vote versus 20.2% for his main rival, Renamo candidate Ossufo Momade, the website shows.\n\nEISA estimates Momade will end up with around 21.4% of the vote while Daviz Simango, of smaller rival the Mozambique Democratic Movement, will secure 6.9%, Rosario told a news conference.\n\nRenamo and Nyusi\u2019s party, the ruling Frelimo, fought on opposite sides of a 16-year civil war that ended in a truce in 1992, but the former foes have clashed sporadically since.\n\nThe pact was meant to bring a formal and definitive end to four decades of violence between the two, shoring up Mozambique\u2019s stability just before blockbuster gas projects in the gas-rich north led by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp and Total take off.\n\nInstead, it is at risk of collapse as tensions rise. Nyusi and Frelimo, which has controlled Mozambique since independence from Portugal in 1975, were widely expected to win the election but not by such a significant margin.\n\nFrelimo spokesman Caifadine Manasse said Renamo regularly complains about elections, despite being part of all the electoral bodies and having delegates at voting stations.\n\n\u201cRenamo is not serious about democracy,\u201d he said.", "description": "Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi is heading for a landslide victory in elections, according to a preliminary estimate by an observer group on Monday, in a contest the opposition claims has been tarnished by \"mega fraud\".", "authors": ["Manuel Mucari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443676821&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0SB-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
