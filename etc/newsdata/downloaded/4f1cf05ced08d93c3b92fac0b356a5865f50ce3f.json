We have been at war for seven years so we can continue the war for seven more years,\" Mazlum Kobani told the newspaper.\n\nHowever, he also urged Americans to \"put pressure on their political and military leaders to stop the Turkish attack\".\n\nHe said the military operation would result in \"big massacres\".\n\nA senior Turkish official said Wednesday that Turkey's troops would \"shortly\" cross into Syria, together with allied Syrian rebel forces to battle the Kurdish fighters as well as ISIL.", "description": "Civilians urged by Kurdish leadership to head to the border with Turkey to face the expected military onslaught.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/d52831324b104043961550a7cddb3ad3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
