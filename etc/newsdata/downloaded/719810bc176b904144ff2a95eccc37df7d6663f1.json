He went on to transfigure his native city, and transfix his readers, with a rich accumulation of poems, metafictions and other unclassifiable prose works, the most recent of which, Exchange Place (2012), was lauded for its elegance and precision.\n\nCarson had Belfast lore and topography at his fingertips, but he superimposed a psychic overlay on the city\u2019s mundane streets and terraces, its feuds and factions, the aggravations and atrocities of the bloody 30-year Troubles.\n\nThe title of his 1989 collection, Belfast Confetti, can refer to the debris falling after an explosion, bits of type erupting from a typewriter (as in its cover image), or a hail of bullets. The high-pressure contents of this book are compressed into an enigmatic and exhilarating pattern of reflections and events.\n\nBelfast Confetti is dedicated to the poet\u2019s father: William Carson, a postman and Irish-language aficionado. He is a strong presence in his son\u2019s literary output. Ciaran\u2019s mother, Mary Maginn, a one-time mill-girl, gets a look-in too; but the father is predominant. From Carson Sr, Ciaran inherited a love of Irish (the five children of the family grew up bilingual), a flair for traditional music and storytelling and a respect for education as a way of making a mark in the world.\n\nFollowing his schooling at St Mary\u2019s Christian Brothers\u2019 grammar school, Ciaran went on to study for a degree in English at Queen\u2019s University \u2013 where one of his tutors was Seamus Heaney, and two other poets, Medbh McGuckian and Paul Muldoon, were fellow students.\n\nHe subsequently became an officer with the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, with responsibility for traditional music, and throughout the 1970s and 80s travelled all over Ireland, playing the flute and the tin whistle in pubs and back rooms, often accompanied by his future wife Deirdre Shannon (herself a gifted fiddle-player). They married in 1982.\n\nOne result of all this jollification was the eccentric and beguiling prose account of those heady days, Last Night\u2019s Fun (1996). \u201cOne of the most inventive looks at Irish music,\u201da reviewer called it, while John Banville summed it up in four words: \u201cWild nights; ashen days\u201d. It\u2019s the wild nights, with all their spark and fervour, that stay in the mind.\n\nThe New Estate (1976) announced the arrival on the poetic scene of a confident new voice. By 1987, however, the lyrical tone of this first book had given way to the disruptions and dislocations of The Irish for No, as \u201cBelfast tore itself apart and patched itself up again\u201d.\n\nOther collections followed with increasing rapidity: First Language (1993); Opera Et Cetera (1996), with its display of technical virtuosity; and the marvellously subversive and narcotic sonnet sequence The Twelfth of Never (1998), in which some of Ireland\u2019s most cherished myths and symbols are taken to pieces and audaciously reassembled.\n\nAt the same time, the poetry was interspersed with idiosyncratic prose works: Fishing for Amber (1999), Shamrock Tea (2001), The Pen Friend (2009), and The Star Factory (1997). The last is Carson\u2019s partly autobiographical, wholly inspirational book about Belfast, which evokes the poet\u2019s \u201cdark city\u201d in all its pungency and particularity.\n\nAsked by the Irish Times earlier this year to nominate his current favourite book, Muldoon chose Carson\u2019s From There to Here: Selected Poems and Translations (2018). Praising his \u201cability to find connections in so many aspects of the world\u201d, he was echoing an earlier comment of his own, that Carson, as an incomparable poet and luminous prose writer, was \u201cterrifically engaged by everything and anything \u2013 stamp-collecting, hurley, cooking\u201d.\n\nIt is this abundance, alongside felicity of expression, humour and immense erudition, that gives Carson\u2019s work its wonderful zest and intricacy.\n\nOther recognition came in the form of the TS Eliot prize, the Irish Times Irish literature prize, the Cholmondeley award, and the Forward prize. Carson\u2019s achievement as a translator was acknowledged with the Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation prize in 2002, for his version of Dante\u2019s Inferno; he also translated The T\u00e1in (2007) and many poems from the original Irish, as well as the French poet Jean Follain (From Elsewhere, 2014). Influences absorbed and cast in a new light \u2013 Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Keats, Borges, Calvino, Flann O\u2019Brien, Alberto Manguel \u2013 impart a cosmopolitan flavour to Carson\u2019s oeuvre, without diluting its intense attachment to his home territory.\n\nSome years after resigning from the Arts Council, Carson became the first director of the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry at Queen\u2019s, a post he held from 2004 until his retirement in 2016. He was a longstanding member of Aosd\u00e1na, the association of Irish artists.\n\nStylish in his bones, he might have applied his comment on Follain \u2013 that he \u201cwas invariably properly dressed for every occasion\u201d \u2013 to himself, with his love of traditional hand-made suits and shoes, antique tweed jackets, silk shirts and subtle ties. \u201cHardy-handsome,\u201d Heaney called him, referring to the portrait of Carson by Jeffrey Morgan, \u201cwith his Black Mountain behind him and his talismanic flute \u2026\u201d\n\nCarson remained characteristically stoical in the face of his illness. His first action on receiving the diagnosis of lung cancer was to embark on a series of poems, ostensibly about paintings (by Poussin, Canaletto and Thomas Jones, among others), but also celebrating his life with Deirdre in a particular part of north Belfast, and of the area itself. The new poems, under the title Still Life, will be published this month.\n\nHis poem Letters from the Alphabet, reaches \u201cZ\u201d, the end-point, and culminates in a two-line stanza that makes an appropriate valediction for the postman\u2019s son: \u201cIn the morning you will open up the envelope. You will get whatever/ Message is inside. It is for all time. Its postmark is The Twelfth of Never.\u201d\n\nHe is survived by Deirdre and their children, Manus, Gerard and Mary.\n\n\u2022 Ciaran Carson, poet, born 9 October 1948; died 6 October 2019", "description": "Poet who superimposed a psychic overlay on the streets and terraces of his native Belfast", "authors": ["Patricia Craig"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d840b11c5f6eadc30c026e93687883eeb710691/0_112_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9325a5b5b499aba4f7aa951c484be992", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
