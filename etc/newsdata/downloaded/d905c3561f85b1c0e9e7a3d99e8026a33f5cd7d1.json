Last week, a State Department official disputed the contention in a complaint filed under federal whistleblower laws by a Central Intelligence Agency officer that another top State Department official, counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, listened in on the call.\n\nHouse Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, and lawmakers are focusing on the whistleblower complaint and a record of the call released by the administration.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles Emailtoken Ufd Reflink Article_Copyurl_Share"], "top_image": ""}
