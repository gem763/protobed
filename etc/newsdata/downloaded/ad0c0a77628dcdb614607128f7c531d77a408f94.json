I met Patrick Day last Thursday for the first time and I was left in absolute pieces, and I only knew him for 30 seconds,' explained Hearn.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s heartbreaking. He is a man who didn\u2019t need to box, he had a family \u2013 he didn\u2019t need that search for money, he did it because he loved the sport of boxing.'\n\nThe 27-year-old American was treated on the canvas at Chicago's Wintrust Arena on Saturday night before being carried out on a stretcher and then placed in a coma from which he never woke up.\n\nTributes have poured in for Day - this is a message from Kazakhstani boxer Gennadiy Golovkin\n\nBritish fighter Tony Bellew also paid his respects with a message on his Twitter page\n\nHearn also praised the work of the medical team in Chicago, but nonetheless admitted the sport of boxing needs to look into measures to protect fighters more robustly.\n\nDay is the fourth boxer to die after competing in a professional fight in 2019.\n\nRussian Maxim Dadashev and Hugo Alfredo Santillan from Argentina died in July, while Bulgarian Boris Stanchov passed away following a fight in September.\n\n\u2018You can say it\u2019s boxing but it\u2019s so hard to justify,' says Hearn.\n\nHearn admitted that the natural risk element of the sport meant nobody was to blame\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been a rough year for the sport so we need to make sure we get together as a community, keep trying to evolve, keep trying to make the sport safer.\n\n\u2018We have to make sure that as a sport, we do better.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s boxing, and it\u2019s very very dangerous. There\u2019s so much more we can do. There\u2019s no one to blame, it\u2019s just the tragedy of the sport.'", "description": "Day passed away after sustaining a brain injury during the 10th round of his fight against Charles Conwell in Chicago last Saturday - the bout took place during Hearn's event.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/10/19876850-0-image-a-14_1571391703425.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
