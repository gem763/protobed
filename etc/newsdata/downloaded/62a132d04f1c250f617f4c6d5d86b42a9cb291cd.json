That\u2019s quite the lineup.\n\nHowever, with both Bruce and James releasing albums in the coming months, one critic online expressed his frustration at not getting to see the Born To Run singer perform, writing: \u2018Bruce Springsteen on the show and yet we have to listen to music from James f***ing Blunt.\u2019\n\nNever one to miss the chance for a sassy clapback, James leapt to his own defence with a withering comeback, providing evidence for our theory that celebs definitely search their own names on social media.\n\nYou got what you deserved. https://t.co/zHY98tWXIB \u2014 James Blunt (@JamesBlunt) October 13, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a simple comment of: \u2018You got what you deserved,\u2019 James left us all reeling as he solidified his status as Twitter clapback king.\n\nIt seems like James\u2019 critics were in the minority when it came to his appearance on the BBC talk show, with fans praising him for both his musical performance and on-sofa chats.\n\nImagine being sat on that sofa\u2026 (Picture: Isabel Infantes/PA)\n\n\u2018You were excellent on Graham Norton,\u2019 one fan wrote, adding: \u2018You made De Niro laugh!\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a big fan of Bruce Springsteen, but when it came to the chat and anecdotes on the show, I have to admit to being more entertained by you,\u2019 another added, in a comment that we\u2019d definitely have printed off and stuck on our walls if we were James.\n\nWhile appearing on the show, the singer performed his latest single Cold, with his next album dropping 25 October after a two-year hiatus from music.\n\nFor his sixth studio album, the 45-year-old has drawn inspiration from the recent deaths of people close to him on the record Once Upon A Mind, which he predicts will do well because \u2018misery sells.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s the spirit, eh James?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
