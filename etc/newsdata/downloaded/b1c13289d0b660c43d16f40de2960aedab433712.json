His resignation came three days after House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the House would begin a full-fledged impeachment investigation.\n\n\"Today, I informed ASU President Crow and Mrs. McCain that I believe the recent media focus on my work as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations risks becoming a distraction from the accomplishments and continued growth of the Institute, and therefore, I am stepping down as executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership,\" Volker said in a statement. \"I know the Institute is well equipped with a first rate team of staff and trustees to continue its progress in the future. \"\n\nENGEL SAYS POMPEO FAILING TO COMPLY WITH HOUSE INQUIRY\n\nCindy McCain, chair of the McCain Institute's board of trustees and the widow of the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., announced that Nick Rasmussen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center and professor at the ASU Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, would serve as the acting executive director in Volker's absence. She also expressed gratitude for Volker's work with the institute.\n\n\"I want to thank Kurt Volker for his dedication and hard work in helping to build the McCain Institute into the results-driven, action-oriented institution that it is today,\" she said. \"We are proud of these accomplishments, and I especially appreciate his dedication to my husband and the entire McCain family.\"\n\nThe McCain Institute's website says it works to train leaders of strong character who will address issues from rule of law to international security to human rights.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nVolker spent last Thursday in a transcribed interview with multiple House committees as the body gathers evidence for its impeachment inquiry. In the testimony, Volker said Ukraine never raised concerns about pressure from Trump for an investigation into Biden's son Hunter's business dealings with Burisma Holdings, even as Trump had put a hold on $400 million in military aid to the country. Burisma is a Ukrainian gas company that was under investigation at one point while the younger Biden was on its board and the elder Biden was Barack Obama's Vice President.", "description": "The former State Department official is one of the key players in the impeachment investigation into President Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/04/694940094001_6092335826001_6092345734001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
