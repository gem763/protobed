Their injuries were not life-threatening, Sakamaki said.\n\nThe heavy rain caused rivers to swell, flipped anchored boats and whipped up sea waters in a dangerous surge along the coast, flooding some residential neighborhoods and leaving people to wade in ankle-deep waters and cars floating.\n\nIn Shizuoka, one of two men who went missing in the Nishikawa River was rescued, Gotemba city official Fumihiko Katsumata said.\n\nFirefighters said the two men were working at a river canal to try to control overflowing when they were swept away.\n\nAn earthquake shook the rain soaked island at 6:22pm on Saturday, shortly before the storm struck Shizuoka, on the south coast of Japan\n\nThe US Geological Survey said the magnitude 5.3 earthquake was centered in the ocean off the coast of Chiba, near Tokyo, and was fairly deep, at 59.5 kilometers\n\nYusuke Ikegaya, a Shizuoka resident who evacuated ahead of the storm, said he was surprised that the nearby river was about to overflow in the morning, hours before the typhoon made landfall.\n\n'In the 28 years of my life, this is the first time I've had to evacuate even before a typhoon has landed,' he said.\n\nAuthorities also warned of mudslides, common in mountainous Japan.\n\nPublic broadcaster NHK said Shiroyama dam in Kanagawa, southwest of Tokyo, may release some of its waters, which were nearing limits. An overflooded dam is likely to cause greater damage, and so releasing some water gradually is a standard emergency measure.\n\nRugby World Cup matches, concerts and other events in the area were canceled, while flights were grounded and train services halted.\n\nAuthorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier in the week, including urging people to stay indoors. Some 17,000 police and military troops were called up, standing ready for rescue operations.\n\nCars pass by at Ginza shopping district in the pouring rain due to Typhoon Hagibis in Tokyo\n\nA woman tries to catch a taxi in the pouring rain as Typhoon Hagibis hits Tokyo\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency warned of dangerously heavy rainfall in Tokyo and surrounding areas, including Gunma, Saitama and Kanagawa\n\nResidents taped up their apartment windows to prevent them from shattering.
