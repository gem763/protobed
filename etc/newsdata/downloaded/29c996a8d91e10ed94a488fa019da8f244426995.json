It appeared to suggest that the year-end deadline on nuclear negotiations should not be missed.Kim Yong-chol also accused the \u201cwarlike forces\u201d of the U.S. military for \u201cplanning nuclear strike exercises\u201d against the North, and said that Washington\u2019s activities with regards to North Korea at the United Nations General Assembly were testing the regime\u2019s patience.\u201cThe situation points to the U.S. intent to isolate and stifle the DPRK in a more crafty and vicious way than before, instead of complying with our call for a change in its calculation method,\u201d the statement continued, using the acronym for the North\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.While an end-of-year ultimatum for a deal has been pressed by the North on multiple occasions, including by the regime\u2019s nuclear envoy after the collapse of denuclearization talks in Stockholm earlier this month, Sunday\u2019s statement stands out given that Kim Yong-chol once spearheaded North Korea\u2019s diplomacy with the United States and South Korea.As the director of the United Front Department (UFD), the North\u2019s leading agency in charge of diplomacy and espionage vis-a-vis the South, Kim Yong-chol undertook the North\u2019s first mission to Washington in over a decade in May last year to deliver Kim Jong-un\u2019s letter to Trump, an event that made possible the first summit between the two countries in Singapore that June.Kim Yong-chol was the first to receive the ax once denuclearization negotiations soured at the second U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February, as he had arranged the talks.He was also sacked as chief of the UFD - though he retained a vice chairmanship in the North\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 Party - while authority to conduct negotiations was then passed to the North\u2019s Foreign Ministry, whose officials apparently favored a more hard-line approach towards talks with Washington.Pyongyang\u2019s decision to issue a statement in Kim Yong-chol\u2019s name can be interpreted as an attempt to apply pressure without antagonizing the United States, in light of his efforts to realize the summits, analysts said. The Kappc is also the state body used to improve ties with countries with which North Korea does not have diplomatic relations, like the United States and South Korea.The statement follows another published message to Washington from a senior North Korean official.On Thursday, Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye-gwan - who once headed the North\u2019s delegation to the six party talks in the mid-2000s - told the official Korean Central News Agency that Kim Jong-un described his relationship with Trump as \u201cspecial.\u201dBut for policymakers in Washington, Kim Kye-gwan only had words of reproach, saying they were \u201cpreoccupied with the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice,\u201d which are contrary to Trump\u2019s better judgement.Kim Kye-gwan\u2019s statement also referred to the end-of-year deadline, which has been connected to nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile tests and an end to Pyongyang\u2019s self-imposed moratorium on such tests. His comments were in line with earlier statements from the North.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/27205939.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
