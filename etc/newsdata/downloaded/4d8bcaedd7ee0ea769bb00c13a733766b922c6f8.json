Sanders\u2019 2020 campaign for the Democratic party\u2019s presidential nomination didn\u2019t allow the media to interview his treating physicians until Friday.\n\nThe public knew earlier this week that Sanders had chest pains and stents put in for a blocked artery, but this is the first time we\u2019ve learned that Bernie Sanders had a heart attack.\n\nPhysicians at the Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas said the Vermont Senator had a \u201cmyocardial infarction.\u201d That\u2019s the term doctors use when a prolonged disruption of blood flow to the heart causes permanent tissue damage to the heart muscle.\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 2020 Prospects Have Changed\n\nNow that Democratic primary voters know the 78-year-old candidate has had a heart attack, it could change the entire calculus of the 2020 nomination contest.\n\nWith all due sympathy for this tragic danger to Sen. Sanders\u2019 health, and for his family who feared for their loved one\u2019s life and the best wishes for his most complete possible recovery, we are duty-bound to ask what will happen next.\n\nBernie Sanders is a public figure who holds elected office. He had an enormous influence on the 2016 presidential election. As he makes another substantial and viable bid for the world\u2019s most powerful elected office in 2020, his heart attack has ramifications of historical import.\n\nOn the face of it, having a heart attack while campaigning makes Sanders unelectable to many voters. That\u2019s if he even decides to continue with his candidacy. Bernie 2020 says he\u2019s still in the race. They\u2019ve promised Sanders will be at the next Democratic Primary debate on Oct. 15.\n\nBut running the U.S. executive branch will be as demanding and stressful as campaigning or more. And voters won\u2019t feel comfortable with a president at high risk of having a heart attack shepherding the country through the next unforeseen crisis.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s May Have Changed Too\n\nIf Bernie does step out of the race, or his supporters jump from his campaign to another, obvious winners include Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. Both hauled impressive fundraising totals in the third quarter. Both appeal to the same political cross-section of voters as the socialist Bernie Sanders. But the non-obvious winner could be Hillary Clinton.\n\nA year ago, Clinton\u2019s chief strategist for her 2008 presidential bid wrote in The Wall Street Journal that she was planning to run again in 2020. This March, she denied that she\u2019d be running again, but that\u2019s what every presidential hopeful says \u2013 until they don\u2019t.\n\nThis January, CNN\u2019s Senior White House Correspondent Jeff Zeleny said Hillary Clinton was telling people in her close circle that she\u2019s leaving the door open to run again in 2020.\n\nShe\u2019s been increasingly more vocal in the media as the impeachment push against Trump ramps up. And while Bernie was in the hospital, Hillary went on a busy media tour, ostensibly to promote \u201cGutsy Women,\u201d a new book she co-wrote with daughter, Chelsea Clinton.\n\nWith Joe Biden\u2019s devastatingly underwhelming fundraising, Wall Street Democrats warning they\u2019ll back Trump if Elizabeth Warren gets the nomination, and now Bernie Sanders\u2019 heart attack, the 2020 Democratic field looks weaker than ever. Hillary might not be able to resist another at-bat.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hillary-afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
