De Niro smirked to Ms Robinson about his young paramour, who was around Ms Robinson's age.\n\n\"De Niro directed Ms Robinson to imagine him on the toilet. He told Ms Robinson that doing manual labour would 'make a man out of you.' De Niro suggested that Ms Robinson could get pregnant using sperm from her (married) male co-worker.\"\n\nHe paid her less than a man, and asked her to do \"stereotypically female\" tasks like putting away his underwear, hanging up his clothes and vacuuming his apartment, she said.\n\nThe \"gratuitous physical contact\" involved him asking her to \"scratch his back, button his shirts, fix his collars, tie his ties, and prod him awake when he was in bed\", she said.\n\nDe Niro's lawyer told US media: \"The allegations made by Graham Chase Robinson against Robert De Niro are beyond absurd.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
