He said it was itchy like mad but also burning him at the same time and couldn\u2019t settle.\n\n\u2018I felt it was my fault and felt really bad for him because you don\u2019t want them [your child] to be in pain, you just wish you could take that pain from them.\u2019\n\nShe was told to take him to A&E in York where he had been staying at his grandmother\u2019s house.\n\nLisa said: \u2018There a doctor bandaged it and said it would need re-dressing and two days later in Manchester we saw a burns doctor who was really good.\n\nCharlie pictured at the henna tattoo stall where he got the artwork on the last day of his holiday (PIcture: Kennedy)\n\n\u2018He said he didn\u2019t think it would scar and put a special burn cream on it and dressed it again.\u2019\n\nCharlie was given some antibiotics and doctors now hope that because he is young his arms will heal without scarring.\n\nLisa continued: \u2018They said it could take months for it to go fully but there\u2019s always the possibility of it leaving that imprint. It\u2019s looking really good at the minute so I\u2019m hopeful it wont scar.\u2019\n\nShe is now urging other parents not to let their children get black henna tattoos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLisa said: \u2018It didn\u2019t ruin Charlie\u2019s holiday because this happened at the end of it but I felt it was my fault.\n\nHis mum is warning others to stay away from black henna tattoos that can leave scars (Picture: Kennedy)\n\n\u2018Before this happened I\u2019d never heard of it, I don\u2019t want anyone else to go through what he has.\n\n\u2018To any parents thinking about letting their children get these black henna tattoos I would advise, just say no.\n\n\u2018Get it up on the internet and show any kids who are asking to have it done plenty of images on Google that would definitely put kids off wanting it.\n\n\u2018My advice would be to stick to your word and say \u2018no\u2019, whether they have a strop or not, it\u2019s just not worth it.\u2019", "description": "A boy who begged his mum to let him have an 'evolution of man' henna tattoo was left in agony after suffering chemical burnes.
