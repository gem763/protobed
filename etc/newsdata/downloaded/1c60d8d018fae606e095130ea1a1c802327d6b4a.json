Gopinath warns that growth is 'not broad-based and precarious.'\n\nShe expects the recovery in 2020, if there is one, to be driven by 'shallower recessions in stressed economies' including Turkey, Argentina and Iran \u2013 all of which face acute geo-political difficulties.\n\nPresident Donald Trump yesterday poured petrol on the fire by imposing sanctions on Turkey over its campaign against Kurdish militias operating in and around Syria.\n\nGopinath called on countries to invest in social and infrastructure capital and suggested that if growth continued to deteriorate an international fiscal response may be required.\n\nThe IMF tone was distinctly bleak with its warning that 'downside risks have been heightened by geopolitical tensions and Brexit-related risks.'\n\nIf the risk is to be reduced, trade barriers would need to be eliminated and geopolitical tensions resolved.\n\nThere was a warning that central banks, which have supported the global economy through low interest rates and monetary easing, might have exhausted their firepower, Gopinath cautioned.\n\nShe also noted that low interest rates could have a negative impact on financial stability.\n\nThere has been a build-up of trillions in corporate debt and concern that this could be a source of instability.", "description": "At the core of the slowdown is the US-China trade dispute, with the IMF's top economist, Gita Gopinath (pictured), warning that increased tariffs would dent global growth.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer In Washington For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
