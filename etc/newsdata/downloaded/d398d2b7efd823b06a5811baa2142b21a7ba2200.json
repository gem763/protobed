(Photo: Disney)\n\nRalph Fiennes isn\u2019t really one for superhero movies. The King\u2019s Man star may be known for playing one of fantasy\u2019s biggest villains in the Harry Potter series, but he\u2019s stayed mostly clear of the Marvel and DC mega-movie universes. Why is that? As he and director Matthew Vaughn put it, there needs to be one thing at the centre of it all: Humanity.\n\n\u201cSuperhero movies are not the first film of choice I go to, I suppose,\u201d Fiennes said. \u201cHaving been in the Harry Potter franchise \u2014 that was very rooted in a very human, young person\u2019s world. From that came these fantastical creatures and things. So, I think that having a really human root, that\u2019s really important.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Ralph is 100-per cent right about is they only work, fantasy or superheroes, if it\u2019s rooted in a realism of humanity,\u201d Vaughn added. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think why people like Star Wars. The first one was a really traditional story. You know, it wasn\u2019t CGI-filled. It was a great balance of proper filmmaking, storytelling and fantastical. I liked the [Harry Potter films] because I just loved the books. And again, it was the fact it was set in a school and there was a boy who didn\u2019t fit in and had to take the world on his shoulders. The magic was just a way of him dealing with it.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Gizmodo about The King\u2019s Man, Vaughn and Fiennes weighed in on the rise in superhero films \u2014 and in Fiennes\u2019 case why he\u2019s largely refused to be part of it, with the exception of voicing Alfred Pennyworth in Lego Batman.\n\nVaughn has his share of experience in comic book and superhero films: He helmed Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class, and wrote the sequel X-Men: Days of Future Past (he also co-produced the disastrous Fantastic Four, but we\u2019re not gonna talk about that).\n\nFiennes noted how superhero stories have, in a sense, always been around \u2014 just look at Greek mythology. But they were mostly about the ways gods connected with regular people, a message that can sometimes get muddled in superhero films where the final 30 minutes are a string of giant CGI-fuelled battles.\n\nVaughn cited films like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, even the recently released Joker, as comic book movies that make sure to keep their characters and stories grounded in humanity. It\u2019s not always easy to do when you have characters with powers, but it\u2019s not impossible. Just look at Harry Potter.\n\n\u201cWhen I did the X-Men I was trying to make these characters real \u2014 and you know, starting off a movie in a concentration camp is about as real as it gets. But then that\u2019s your foundation and then you can build fantastical stuff on it,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cYou have to have something to relate to. Otherwise there are a lot of superhero films where they\u2019re just whizzing around them blowing things up, and you get bored because you can\u2019t relate to it.\u201d\n\nThen of course, you\u2019ve got the Kingsman series. They may not have powers, but the heroes and villains in these stories (based on a graphic novel series) definitely have an element of superhero-ness to them.\n\nSomething that wasn\u2019t lost on Fiennes, who noted how having The King\u2019s Man prequel take place on the cusp of World War I gives it more of a weight and human connection... while still having sword fights with Rasputin.\n\n\u201cMy take on this Kingsman is that it is entering in very different territory to the other two movies \u2014 in that the human dilemma at the centre of it gives it a gravitas, which I think is really compelling,\u201d he said.\n\nThe King\u2019s Man comes out February 13, 2020.", "description": "Ralph Fiennes isn\u2019t really one for superhero movies.
