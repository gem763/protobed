It helped put Afterpay on the radar of America's Millennial generation, those aged between 22 and 37 years old.\n\n\"Some of the best Millennial brands in the world are being developed out of the US and they didn\u2019t exist three years ago. They have built amazing brands and are speaking to the consumer how they want to be spoken to. It is amazing to watch retail change,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Kardashian experience says a few other things about the Afterpay, which launched only four years ago after being founded by Molnar, now 29 \u2013 the youngest person on this year's Financial Review Rich List \u2013 and Anthony Eisen, 47.\n\nBoth Rich List debutants this year, each were worth $487 million when it was ruled off and would be worth even more today given the sharp rise in Afterpay's shares over the past month, which hit $28 in May (they listed at $1 in 2016).\n\nThe story shows how Afterpay's growth trajectory is wedded to the United States. It's a rare example of an Australian-born technology player seeking to conquer the world's biggest market. The Kardashians' interest also illustrates how savvy retailers are thinking about how technology can connect with the Millennial cohort.\n\nCustomers stay loyal\n\nMolnar and his team have signed more than 23,000 retailers in Australia and more than 2000 in the US to the service, which works by paying the retailer for the goods at the point of sale (minus a fee of 4 per cent to 6 per cent of the cost of goods sold). It takes a quarter of the purchase price from the customer right away and the remaining three-quarters in three fortnightly instalments. If customers pay on time, they pay nothing more than the price tag; there are fees for late payments.\n\nAnd so Molnar's and Eisen's rise to riches is a result of turning the traditional credit model on its head. Retailers are willing to pay far more than the fees they pay to banks for credit card payments because Afterpay is sending them incremental sales and works as a marketing platform. It is providing 2 million leads a month to US retailers, while in Australia, it's the second largest traffic driver of traffic to many retailing website after Google.\n\nWith Nick Molnar (right) focused on customers and retailers, it's been Anthony Eisen who has taken charge of much of the day-to-day business operations at Afterpay. Supplied\n\nFor customers, Molnar has tapped a growing aversion to credit cards and he says this dynamic appears even stronger at the top end of Generation Z, currently 6 to 21 years old. Because Afterpay stops users spending more until all debts are paid back, customers aren't able to kick a larger and larger bill down the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMolnar says the company is a product of his own coming of age through the global financial crisis. As an 18-year-old in 2008, he remembers the media messages about not spending money you don\u2019t have, and says has been ingrained in the Millennial psyche. In the US, two out of every three people aged 18 to 30 don\u2019t have a credit card.\n\n\u201cThe Millennials [in the US] have been even more pronounced in their aversion to traditional credit products. Everyone thinks Millennials are fickle and disloyal but the reality is they are overly loyal to brands that earn their support and are spending money differently to any previous generation. And if you look at Gen Z, they will shop online even more and they are even more averse to credit.\"\n\nWith Molnar focused on customers and retailers, it's been Eisen who has taken charge of much of the day-to-day business operations at Afterpay including raising its funding, a delineation Molnar says has worked well. Eisen's steady hand was needed for much of last year, after Afterpay traded through a period of intense volatility as short sellers targeted it while regulators investigated whether more onerous regulation was needed. Ultimately, a light touch approach was adopted.\n\nMolnar says the scrutiny was worth it \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think we could be where we are now if we weren\u2019t public, especially starting from Australia\u201d \u2013 yet he also laments Australia's conservative investor community, especially when assessing consumer-facing technology companies.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate the benefit of launching in Australia and going offshore. The venture community is very focused on price. But the focus should be on the international opportunity and how you scale in Australia well and learn, and then create new exports for the country,\" he says.\n\nMolnar and Eisen have created a retailing model for the times; as the banking royal commission focused on irresponsible lending and banks scramble to restore trust with sceptical customers, Afterpay has engineered a system that doesn't allow customers to accumulate more and more debt. And its net promoter score is 88.\n\n\u201cOur customers love us because we\u2019ve got their back,\" says Molnar. \"If they go late, we say sorry, you can\u2019t keep shopping until you pay that back. That actually makes them love us more.\n\n\u201cTraditional credit products don\u2019t stop people spending when they are late because the business model works by maximising revenue from a customer revolving. We never let a customer revolve. We never let them pay to extend the debt.\n\n\u201cThose checks and balances and rules actually help build advocacy for our brand.\u201d\n\nFind out who are Australia's richest people in the Financial Review Rich List 2019, out on Friday May 31.", "description": "When the youngest Rich Lister, Nick Molnar, 29, took a call from US retailing royalty, he knew he had to move quickly to impress.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.913%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_343%2C$y_60/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/31fb665fc692a65974dae5437f82cc49d7747b67", "published_at": "2019-05-30"}
