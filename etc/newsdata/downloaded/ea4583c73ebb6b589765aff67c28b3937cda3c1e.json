If she still thought that now, if she thought she had the best odds of beating Donald Trump, I think she would think about it long and hard,\" Reines said. \"She might as well run. She might be the best person to beat President Pence -- I'm sorry, I meant President Trump.\"\n\nPrior to Reines' interview, speculation had been growing that Clinton would make a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race after reports Tuesday said members of the Democratic establishment doubted any of the party\u2019s current top candidates can beat the president next November.\n\nBut those Democrats already running said Clinton is doing more harm than good for the party by taking aim at Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, in recent remarks.\n\nClinton in recent weeks has privately stated she would enter the 2020 presidential race if she were certain she could win, The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n\nThe story, titled \u201cAnxious Democratic Establishment Asks, \u2018Is There Anybody Else?\u2019\u201d said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against the president.\n\n\"It is so frustrating to keep hearing this from her over and over again,\" Wright said. \"Look, the country made it very clear not once, but twice, that we're not interested. We're just not that into her. It doesn't seem that she's getting the message.\"\n\nWright added that he thought Clinton was probably \"first and foremost\" trying to sell her books.\n\n\"She got $8 million for her memoir. The Clinton family made over $23 million on their books. So, she throws some bombs, whether it be the Tulsi Gabbard stuff, teasing this 2020 run -- I think that's a part of it,\" he theorized.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"But, again, I think the other piece of it really is, at the end of the day, it's her ego. It's her bruised sense of self,\" said Wright.\n\nFox News' Danielle Wallace, Charles Creitz, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is inserting herself into the political narrative once again because of her \"bruised sense of self,\" former CIA officer and Democrat Bryan Dean Wright said Thursday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Bryan-Dean-Wright-Hillary-Clinton-FOX-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
