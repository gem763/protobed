Kay Hagan, who had been ill for years due to a tick-borne illness that caused brain inflammation, died Monday at 66.\n\nHagan, a moderate Democrat who represented North Carolina, beat powerful incumbent Republican Elizabeth Dole to win her seat in 2008, before losing to Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., in 2014. Colleagues and family honored her service in statements on Monday.\n\n\"We are heartbroken to share that Kay left us unexpectedly this morning,\" her family said in a statement, according to the Charlotte Observer. \"Kay meant everything to us, and we were honored to share her with the people of North Carolina whom she cared for and fought for so passionately as an elected official. Most of all, we already miss her humor and spirit as the hub of our family, a role she loved more than anything. Nobody could light up a room and make people feel welcome like Kay.\"\n\nHagan was hospitalized in 2016 with encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. A family spokeswoman described the cause as a virus that's spread by ticks from animals to humans, citing a doctor who had been treating her. Test results indicated Hagan contracted what's known as the Powassan virus.\n\nELIJAH CIMMINGS HONORED AT DIGNITARY-PACKED FUNERAL, AS EULOGIES TAKE POLITICAL TURN\n\nHagan's recovery was slow, though her family said she had improved significantly.

In our time as Senate colleagues, we worked across the aisle together frequently on issues that we both knew would determine what type of country our children would inherit, from conservation to our common defense. She tackled everything she did with a passion and a sense of humor that will be missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.\u201d\n\nThe Greensboro Democrat, who served in the Senate for six years, lost her seat in 2014 to Tillis.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Susan and I are absolutely heartbroken by Senator Kay Hagan\u2019s sudden passing and we extend our condolences and prayers to her loving family and many friends,\" Tillis said Monday. \"We join all North Carolinians in remembering her dedicated and distinguished record of public service to our state and nation.\"\n\nDuring her time in office, Hagan served on the committees for Armed Services; Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.
