I don't want that to be how everyone in Alaska or everywhere else sees us as Native people, there's so many beautiful parts to us.\"\n\nThe response to the podcast has been overwhelming positive, said Glenn.\n\n\"People have been reaching out to me from literally all over the world to thank me, to say how much this episode, or that episode has touched them, and that I'm doing important work,\" said Glenn.\n\nGlenn is excited to see more and more Indigenous people using podcasting to tell their stories.\n\n\"Only we as Native people know the intricacies and the complexities and the beautiful parts of our culture, enough to share,\" said Glenn.\n\n\"I think that if we don't have that representation, if we don't have people like us who understand and know the way we grew up and our experiences as native people share those stories, it's just not going to be accurate.\"", "description": "Coffee & Quaq is a new podcast out of Anchorage, Alaska that looks at contemporary issues impacting Indigenous people living in the state.\u00a0Host and producer Alice Glenn says the name of the podcast is a nod to both contemporary and traditional aspects of her Inupiaq culture.", "authors": ["Stephanie Cram"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5296986.1569435579!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/coffee-and-quaq-collage-with-border.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
