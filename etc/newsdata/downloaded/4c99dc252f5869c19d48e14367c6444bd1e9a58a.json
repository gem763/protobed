But a casual observer of the political scene could be forgiven for thinking that the former secretary of state had already jumped into the race.\n\nRecently there were as many or more mainstream and social media stories about the former first lady than there were about the declared Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nThe gossip about the possibility of a third Hillary Clinton presidential campaign originated with the concerns of big Democratic campaign donors about Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden: Trump 'an idiot' for saying Russian interference a 'hoax' Biden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE\u2019s failure to take a firm hold on the nomination.

There are a couple of possibilities.\n\nSecretary Clinton is on a media tour promoting a book she co-wrote with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. All the publicity about the possibility of a presidential campaign is certainly a boost for sales and her ego.\n\nOr she might really be thinking about running for president, because recent events have vindicated her 2016 presidential campaign. Last week, the Trump State Department exonerated her of wrongdoing in the handling of her infamous emails. On top of that, Trump\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior indicates that everything she said about candidate Trump in 2016 was true, so perhaps now she wants to prove it by beating him in 2020.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaybe she feels that she should join the campaign and rise to defend herself since her enemies on both the left and right are still beating her up three years after her campaign ended. Trump\u2019s terrible twitter tantrums regularly vilify \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d Online supporters of Sanders still strike out at the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee for beating their champion out for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nClinton does have assets that she could bank on if she chooses to run for president for a third time.\n\nClinton still has a strong following within the Democratic Party, and her warning about Trump's presidency seem prescient. If she defeated the fractured Democratic field, she would be in a better position to beat a beleaguered president in 2020 than she was to defeat candidate Trump in 2016. A victory would allow Clinton to have the last laugh.\n\nAs a former first lady who was an active partner in her husband\u2019s presidency, former U.S. senator and secretary of state, Clinton\u2019s political resume is unmatched. Her national security experience would be an asset in a presidency that she would dedicate to restoring American credibility on the international stage after Trump\u2019s fractured foreign policy.\n\nBut the liabilities of a new Clinton candidacy outweigh the assets.\n\nShe may have won the popular vote by almost three million ballots in the last presidential election. But her decision to ignore the midwestern industrial states after she secured the nomination was one of the many tactical mistakes that stopped her from winning the electoral college majority necessary to stop Trump.\n\nHillary Clinton is 72 years old. The three frontrunners in the Democratic presidential race are Sanders at 78, Biden at 76 and Warren at 70. The Democrats need another seventy-something candidate as much as Donald Trump needs another scandal.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s major vulnerabilities heading into 2020 is his failure to deliver on his 2016 campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d The swamp creatures in Washington are bigger, uglier and scarier now than they were three Halloweens ago. Clinton is the ultimate Washington insider, which is more of a red flag to voters now than it was then.\n\nClinton is also an incredibly polarizing figure. Some people love her, and some people hate her. But she will be hard pressed to win over the independent voters who have soured on Trump and are looking to Democrats to provide a suitable alternative.\n\nFor these and other reasons, Clinton should \u2013 and probably will \u2013 pass on another presidential race. She won\u2019t be president. But the events of the last three years have vindicated her.\n\nHer dire warnings about the dangers of a Trump presidency have come to pass. The FBI and Donald Trump\u2019s own department have absolved her of any wrongdoing for her email usage while she was secretary of state.\n\nHillary Clinton didn\u2019t break the glass ceiling in 2016, but she put millions of cracks in it. If Warren or one of the other female Democratic candidates becomes president, she will owe a debt of gratitude to the 2016 Democratic standard bearer who was and always will be the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major political party.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s legacy is safe and it\u2019s time for her to quit while she\u2019s still ahead.\n\nBrad Bannon is a Democratic pollster and CEO of Bannon Communications Research.
