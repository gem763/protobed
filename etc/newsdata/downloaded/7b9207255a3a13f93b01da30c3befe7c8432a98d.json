And there's a lot of downside to that for customers as it relates to environmentals, like power, space, cooling, the management of a bunch of bespoke systems, as well as it drives a lot of copying of data between systems so that they can end up with the aggregated set of data.\"\n\nWhat customers have needed she said, is \"a single data hub platform that could deliver the multi-dimensional performance to address all of these diverse needs at the same time.\"\n\nMust read:\n\nSpecifically, the AI Data Hub is designed to integrate ingestion and inference via Kubernetes orchestration. The three parts of the AI Data Hub include design tools with RAPIDS and PureTools, development with AIRI and FlashStack for AI and T4 for model deployment.\n\nIn addition, Pure Storage said its AIRI platform is available as a service through managed service partners such as Core Scientific.\n\nSeparately, Pure Storage announced additions to its Cloud Data Services portfolio to widen its reach with public cloud providers. Pure Storage launched Cloud Block Store for AWS as well as backup storage with Microsoft Azure via Purity CloudSnap.\n\nStephanie Condon contributed to this report.", "description": "The storage company said it co-developed the AI Data Hub with Nvidia to break down the data silos that hamper analytics and model development.", "authors": ["Larry Dignan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/04/03/c229621b-033b-47e6-8dd5-5f6ad075fc23/thumbnail/770x578/1d89ae33c4ab28af770ecafaf8d1b4fd/data-center-cloud.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
