The malware was injected by initiating a WhatsApp call which the targets did not need to answer for their phones to become infected.\n\nThe hacking tool, dubbed \u201cPegasus\u201d could remotely retrieve calls, messages, and location on smartphones running Android, iOS, and BlackBerry operating systems.\n\nNSO Group is reported to have several government contracts around the world for surveillance tools and Pegasus is its most popular products.\n\nIn May, engineers conducting routine security checks noticed the malware in circulation and WhatsApp urged its 1.5bn users to update the app to ensure they were using a safer version. It did not say at the time how many, or whom, had been affected but announced that a \u201cselect number\u201d of users had been victims. The bug affected all but the latest version of the app on iOS and Android.\n\nWhatsApp numbers implicated included country codes from several countries including Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico, Facebook said.\n\nFacebook's lawyers will argue that NSO Group broke WhatsApp's terms of service and broke the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nIn May, the Financial Times reported that a UK-based human rights lawyer had been targeted, along with Amnesty International. At the time, NSO Group\u2019s spokesman said it was investigating but that it \u201cwould not, or could not\u201d use its own software to target an individual or organisation.\n\nNSO, which has used several different names to avoid scrutiny, was founded in Israel in 2010. It opened a marketing headquarters in the US and in 2014, San Francisco Partners, a Silicon Valley-based investment company invested an undisclosed sum into the startup. It sold its controlling stake to Novalpina, a London-based equity company in February.", "description": "WhatsApp is suing an Israeli surveillance company for a cyber attack targeting 1,400 users earlier this year.", "authors": ["Margi Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xE3NFuRbhA1t8JOOYQS0zw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/85f2e69ee8224c2d2077df39516930f8", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
