He strained his left biceps on March 31 in his third game, strained a shoulder and calf during his rehabilitation and did not return until June 18. Just a week later, he strained the posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during an awkward headfirst slide into third base.\n\nStanton is hitting .290 with one home run and seven RBIs. He took batting practice on Tuesday against reliever Dellin Betances, who hopes to return this month from a lat injury that has sidelined him since spring training.\n\nBetances and right-hander Luis Severino were scheduled to pitch at Double-A Trenton on Friday rather than for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The RailRiders are at Durham, which could have rain related to Hurricane Dorian. Severino, also out with a lat injury, pitched one inning for Scranton last Sunday in his season debut.\n\nLeft-hander CC Sabathia, on the injured list for the fourth time in his final season, tested his chronically painful right knee by playing catch for the second straight day.\n\nLeft-hander Jordan Montgomery started for Trenton on Wednesday in his third appearance since Tommy John surgery on June 7 last year.\n\nBoone said 20-year-old right-hander Deivi Garcia will remain at Scranton for the rest of the International League playoffs. Garcia is 1-3 with a 5.40 ERA in six starts and five relief appearances since his promotion to the RailRiders in July, striking out 45 and walking 20 in 40 innings.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s still kind of finding his way at that level,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very young guy and still developing in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nInfielder Gio Urshela, who hurt his right groin on Aug. 28, ran the bases and could be activated when eligible on Sunday at Boston.\n\nThird baseman Miguel And\u00fajar, recovering from season-ending surgery on May 20 to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder, plans to start throwing next week and expects to be ready for spring training.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stronger now. It definitely feels better than it did before,\u201d And\u00fajar said through a translator. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the work that they did. It\u2019s showing progression.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yankees outfielder Giancarlo Stanton will head to the team's minor league complex in Tampa, Florida, this week for batting practice, among the final steps before returning for the final weeks of an injury-wrecked season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/yankees_inuries_84961_c0-181-4331-2706_s1770x1032.jpg?d8e1e320ae529e31c732202611e98c58071d37b1"}
