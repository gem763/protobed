(NASDAQ:LSBK) For The 3.2% Dividend", "language": "en", "text": "Dividend paying stocks like Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:LSBK) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nIn this case, Lake Shore Bancorp likely looks attractive to investors, given its 3.2% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 1.9% of market capitalisation this year. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Lake Shore Bancorp for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNasdaqGM:LSBK Historical Dividend Yield, September 3rd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 74% of Lake Shore Bancorp's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 50% generally implies a business is reaching maturity, although it is still possible to reinvest in the business or increase the dividend over time.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Lake Shore Bancorp's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Lake Shore Bancorp has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.20 in 2009, compared to US$0.48 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 9.1% per year over this time. Lake Shore Bancorp's dividend payments have fluctuated, so it hasn't grown 9.1% every year, but the CAGR is a useful rule of thumb for approximating the historical growth.\n\nDividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. While there may be fluctuations in the past , Lake Shore Bancorp's earnings per share have basically not grown from where they were five years ago. Flat earnings per share are acceptable for a time, but over the long term, the purchasing power of the company's dividends could be eroded by inflation.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Lake Shore Bancorp's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Lake Shore Bancorp's payout ratio is within an average range for most market participants. Second, earnings per share have been essentially flat, and its history of dividend payments is chequered - having cut its dividend at least once in the past. To conclude, we've spotted a couple of potential concerns with Lake Shore Bancorp that may make it less than ideal candidate for dividend investors.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc.
