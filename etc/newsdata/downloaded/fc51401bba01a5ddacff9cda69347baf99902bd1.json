This is bonkers, everyone knows I love a picture and a video but this is beyond a joke, this is crazy.\n\n\"I'm just so confused, it's something else. I've been a professional boxer for eight or nine years; I'm known to the police, I don't socialise with bad people, I have a good team around me.\n\n\"It's unbelievable. They arrested me yesterday for suspected terorism. I don't know what's next, I don't have no phone. I'm bailed until October 29; it's bonkers.\"\n\nIn a statement released to The Sun , police said: \"A man who was arrested in east London on suspicion of terrorism offences has been released on bail.\n\n\"The man, who is in his 30s, was arrested on Wednesday 2 October on suspicion of collection of information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism under section 58 of the Terrorist Act.\n\n\"He was detained under PACE and taken to a south London police station where he was subsequently released on bail to a date in late October.\n\n\"Officers from the Met\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command are investigating and carried out a search at an address in east London as part of the investigation.\n\n\"Enquiries continue.\"", "description": "Camacho, who retired earlier this year, also claimed police raided his mum's house", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Philip Sharkey Tgs Photo Rex", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20435141.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-04-at-144359.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
