According to parents, she said: \u2018You better finish off your work quick, or I\u2019ll ship you all off to the gas chambers.\u2019\n\nIt is understood that when challenged by one of the pupils, the teacher said she was \u2018joking\u2019 and apologised, before asking the children not to tell anyone.\n\nA teacher, from Newberries Primary School in Hertfordshire, has been sacked for \u2018joking\u2019 with Jewish pupils that she would \u2018ship them off to the gas chambers\u2019 if they did not finish their homework\n\nHowever, pupils informed their parents and the news soon spread on school WhatsApp groups.\n\nMany parents telephoned and emailed the head teacher to complain, with some even threatening to withdraw their children unless the staff member was dismissed.\n\nOn Thursday evening, the board of governors held an emergency meeting to discuss the issue, and dismissed the teacher the next day.\n\nThe action was instant because the woman was an agency worker, and therefore had no permanent employment contract with Newberries, it is understood.\n\nOn Thursday evening, the board of governors held an emergency meeting to discuss the issue, and dismissed the teacher the next day\n\nThe school, which has 203 pupils aged four to 11, is in Radlett, Hertfordshire, a commuter village where around a quarter of the 8,000 residents identify as Jewish.\n\nOne parent, who did not want to be named, said: \u2018To the credit of the school they made it clear they wanted to deal with the situation without delay.\n\n\u2018They did not seek to dispute the suggestion that the teacher had made the reference to \u201cgas chambers\u201d.
