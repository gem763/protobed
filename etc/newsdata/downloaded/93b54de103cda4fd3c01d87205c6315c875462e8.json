Surprise! In a new interview with Forbes, the Nine Inch Nails frontman (who is among the nominees for the 2020 Rock Hall inductee class) explained that inducting his favorite band, the Cure, at this year\u2019s ceremony provided him with much more emotional and professional fulfillment than he ever expected, so why not keep those good vibes going for Nine Inch Nails, too? \u201cIt felt validating. I wanted to see them respected someplace I feel they deserve,\u201d Reznor said. \u201cIt ended up being a pretty cool experience, and I thought, All right, it doesn\u2019t feel as bullshit as I kind of snarkily dismissed it as. I don\u2019t have any problem admitting I\u2019ve changed my opinion about something.\u201d Kudos goes to the crowd and to Robert Smith as well:\n\nI walk backstage \u2019cause the Cure\u2019s gonna come up. I go out and do my thing, and I\u2019m not sure if the Cure is gonna resonate with the audience; the audience I see sitting on the floor there is mostly old industry people. Then I walk out to do the induction, it\u2019s loud applause for them, and it seems real. They come up, and I can see that Robert Smith is happy and the other guys in the band are all kind of freaked out.\n\nIn addition to Nine Inch Nails (whose only inducting member would be Reznor, due to the band\u2019s many iterations over the years), other nominees for 2020\u2019s Rock Hall class include the Doobie Brothers, Whitney Houston, Kraftwerk, and Depeche Mode. The official inductees will be announced early next year, with ceremony being held in Cleveland in May.", "description": "Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails admitted he regretted the way he talked about the Rock Hall in the past, now that he\u2019s a nominee.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/29/29-trent-reznor.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
