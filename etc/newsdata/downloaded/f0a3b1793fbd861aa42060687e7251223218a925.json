Could he be gay?", "language": "en", "text": "Before you do anything drastic, you may want to look at things a bit differently, says Annalisa Barbieri\n\nI am 31, and have been dating my boyfriend, J, for a year. I am developing deep feelings for him, but have an inkling that he is a sexually repressed homosexual. I do not want to end up falling in love with him, marrying \u2013 having children \u2013 only to find out that, although he may have loved me, we never truly shared a sexual attraction.\n\nDespite his tender and affectionate nature, I have never felt him to be sexually attracted to me. I often initiate sex (and am often ignored). In previous relationships, I have found myself fending off consistent unwanted advances, and any move on my part would have been taken up. When we do have sex he turns the lights off, and it\u2019s always just before we go to sleep.\n\nWhen I raised the idea that he might not be sexually attracted to me, he flipped out, saying I lacked tact. He mentioned early on that he separates \u201csexual desire\u201d or \u201csex\u201d from \u201cemotional connection\u201d, which left me aghast: the feeling of being in love, for me, is deeply bound up with sexual and emotional intimacy. I am very troubled and need to know if he wants me.\n\nYou have a hunch that something isn\u2019t right, and that\u2019s worth listening to: if you don\u2019t feel desired in a sexual relationship it can be utterly demoralising (I get dozens of letters about this every week), and there\u2019s no reason to put up with this if that\u2019s what is happening, or if this is how the relationship makes you feel.\n\nHowever, before you do anything drastic, you may want to look at things a bit differently. I wonder where you learned that a man \u201cwanting you\u201d was defined by \u201cconsistent and often unwanted\u201d advances rather than the \u201ctender, affectionate and caring\u201d man you are with at the moment? I consulted Murray Blacket, a sexual and relationship psychotherapist (cosrt.org.uk). \u201cYour fear is that J doesn\u2019t find you sexually attractive, and your defence is that loads of other men have, so you look for suggestions as to why that might be true: ie, he must be gay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people often make a judgment \u2013 \u2018My boyfriend doesn\u2019t fancy me, therefore he must be gay\u2019 \u2013 instead of addressing the more difficult question of what\u2019s going on in their sex life.\u201d\n\nJ may be gay, but Blacket put forward some other theories based on experiences with his patients. \u201cJ may be less sexually experienced than you \u2013 or the men you are used to. He may be shy, lacking in confidence or experience; or you may have mismatched libidoes, or ways of initiating sex. If in response, you are asking J: \u2018Are you gay?\u2019 or \u2018Why don\u2019t you fancy me?\u2019 in response, that would feel like an attack for any man \u2013 but especially if he\u2019s lacking in experience and already nervous.\u201d\n\nEqually, if J isn\u2019t making advances towards you in the way you\u2019d like then, naturally enough, you are going to have questions about yourself.\n\nSo, what do you do? You may feel it\u2019s too much to go and see a relationship therapist at this stage, but if you\u2019re serious about this man you do need to find a way for you both to be able to communicate. The longer I do this job, the more I see sex as just another form of communication, and the lack of it as a breakdown in communication between a couple. It\u2019s rare to find a couple who can\u2019t communicate, but have great sex.\n\nShould my partner use our money to subsidise his adult sons? Read more\n\nHow often are you having sex and what do you class as sex? \u201cSo many couples [that I see] think that only penetrative sex is sex, or that a man with an erection who can penetrate a woman is the gold standard,\u201d Blacket said. But the truth is, there are many other ways to have sex, feel wanted and desired.\n\nBlacket said that \u201calthough you may not be asking questions of J in the right way, they are good questions\u201d. He suggested \u201cnot doing what I often see happen, which is that one person is unhappy and so they say to their partner, \u2018You need to go and get this seen to.\u2019\u201d\n\nYou both need to take responsibility for your part in it. Putting him on the defensive isn\u2019t going to make him feel great. Remember: there are two of you in this relationship.\n\n\u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.
