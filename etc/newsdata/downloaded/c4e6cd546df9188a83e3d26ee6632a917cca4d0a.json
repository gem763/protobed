But during the summers, he lives on a 20-foot-long, 8-foot-wide shantyboat he built, and travels through river communities across the country.\n\nRead more: An architect who built his dream tiny home in Colorado shares 30 photos that go behind the scenes of designing a tiny house\n\nThe creation of Modes' shantyboat, which is named Dotty, began in 2012. Modes told Business Insider that prior to the shantyboat, he would partake in what is called punk rafting \u2014 the art of building a raft out of scavenged materials. With his rafts, he would set sail for several weeks at a time on various rivers.\n\nEventually, Modes decided he wanted something more permanent\n\nModes wanted to be more than just an observer and decided he would use a homemade shantyboat to explore river communities and river cultures around the country.\n\n\"Rather than just being a tourist who floats through towns, I wanted to give something back to these communities,\" he told Business Insider. \"I thought I might be able to give back the gift of listening.\"\n\nSo, during the summers, with one or more shipmates, Modes lives on the shantyboat and moves through various river communities recording the stories of the people who live in them.\n\nSince its maiden voyage down the Mississippi River, Dotty has sailed through rivers all over the US: the Tennessee River, the Sacramento River, the Hudson River, and the Ohio River. Over the last six years, Dotty has traveled 1,800 miles on five different rivers and through 16 states, Modes told Business Insider.\n\n\"When I'm not teaching, I'm on the river,\" he said.\n\nKeep reading for a look inside the boat.\n\nAre you living in a tiny home, boat or any alternate means of housing?
