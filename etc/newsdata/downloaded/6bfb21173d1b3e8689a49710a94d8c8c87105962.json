The 39-year-old Miller was terrific after being slotted in for starter John Gibson on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nPierre-Luc Dubois scored for Columbus, and Joonas Korpisalo had 22 saves.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, Silverberg got a short-handed goal when he put back a rebound to cap an odd-man rush that was set up by a deflection off an official's skate. Fowler scored two minutes later, taking a drop pass from Ondrej Kase and beating Korpisalo from the right circle.\n\nDubois made it a one-goal game late in the second when he tore down the left side and delivered a sharp-angle shot that went in off Miller's arm.\n\nColumbus pulled the goalie with two minutes remaining, but managed only two shots with the man advantage.\n\nAnaheim Ducks forward Ryan Getzlaf (15) jumps next to Columbus Blue Jackets goalie Joonas Korpisalo (70), of Finland, as Blue Jackets defenseman David Savard (58) and Ducks forward Ondrej Kase (25), of the Czech Republic, watch during the first period of an NHL hockey game in Columbus, Ohio, Friday, Oct. 11, 2019.
