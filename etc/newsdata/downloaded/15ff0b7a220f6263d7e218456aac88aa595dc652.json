Indeed, as she consulted with her two adult daughters about where to move, dozens of spots were on the table. \u201cWe had this blue-sky conversation \u2014 where can we all go and live together?\u201d the 63-year-old former Springfield, Mass., resident recalls. \u201cCanada was out because it was too cold. We wanted the tropics because we were sick of winter. We ruled out Asia because it was too far and [because of] the language barrier. Australia was too expensive.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish speaker had been to Latin America numerous times, and her older daughter, a musician, worked a lot in Brazil, so they began looking around there. They ruled out Belize because of a \u201clack of infrastructure,\u201d and Costa Rica because of its cost and \u201cpoor track record with health care,\u201d according to Taft. But Boquete, Panama \u2014 a lush, mild-weather town in the Panamanian highlands that\u2019s popular with expats \u2014 checked nearly all their boxes.\n\niStock White clouds above the small town of Boquete.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place of indescribable beauty, and the culture is complex and vibrant,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sleepy town in the mountains; there\u2019s arts and culture, birding, sailing, hiking, restaurants with chefs from around the world \u2014 it\u2019s a foodie paradise. There\u2019s so much going on here.\u201d (Travel guide Lonely Planet has this to say: \u201cBoquete is known for its cool, fresh climate and pristine natural surroundings. Flowers, coffee, vegetables and citrus fruits flourish in its rich soil, and the friendliness of the locals seems to rub off on everyone who passes through.\u201d)\n\nPlus, Mary says she and her daughters were fed up with a lot of things in America \u2014 including the high cost of living, repeated mass shootings and what she saw as a lot of \u201crage and hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has gotten so out of control \u2014 the social fabric is shattering,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is an act of insanity to continue to stay in the U.S.,\u201d she adds, noting that in Panama crime is low, you see guns less frequently, and life can be more affordable.\n\n\n\n(Indeed, Panama is a pretty safe country: The U.S. government puts Panama at a Level 1 in terms of safety, the best ranking you can get \u2014 though it advises Americans not to travel to parts of the Mosquito Gulf and Darien Region due to crime. And it\u2019s important to note that some types of crime may be more prevalent in Panama than the United States, and there are plenty of countries that are even safer.)\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Mary moved to Panama with her two daughters \u2014 and she\u2019s staying put.\n\n\u201cUnless somebody dies, I don\u2019t envision going back there,\u201d she says. \u201cI have only been back once. I had to go to Miami to do some personal banking, I did the banking, and I got back on the plane.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what life is like \u2014 including costs, health care, residency and more \u2014 in Boquete, Panama ...\n\nImages courtesy of Mary Taft\n\nThe cost: \u201cI spend about the same [as in the U.S.], but I have a much better lifestyle for the same cost,\u201d Mary says. While she had one house in Massachusetts, in Panama she has two homes \u2014 a three-bedroom condominium unit at the beach and roughly 6,000 square feet of house, which includes a main house and a little two-bedroom casita on the property, perched up in the mountains. Mary says she purchased the house for $499,000 and the apartment for $219,000, adding that \u201cit is possible to purchase lovely, well-appointed houses that are a bit smaller in the $200,000 range.\u201d (Referring to her daughters and pets, she says, \u201cEach of us has a separate section of the house,\u201d she explains, joking that \u201cthere would be blood flowing\u201d if they all lived on top of one another.)\n\nSome things are expensive in the area, like eating out, which might cost \u201c$40 a person at upscale restaurants, or $10 a person at a medium-scale restaurant, or $7 per person at a t\u00edpico Panamanian restaurant,\u201d she says, reporting that she loves the food in the area. (But local Panamanian beer can be had for $1, she adds, and you can get a good Chilean wine at the grocery store for $5 to $7.)\n\nOther things are more affordable: Her electricity bill is only about $30 a month because of her solar panels, she says, and her cellphone bill is $20 a month, \u201cbut everyone uses WhatsApp for everything,\u201d so she says she is \u201cprobably overpaying.\u201d\n\nInternational Living magazine breaks out the costs of living in Boquete, estimating that you could live pretty well on about $1,550 to $2,600 a month:\n\n\u2022 Rent (two-bedroom, centrally located apartment): $800 to $1,200 per month\n\n\u2022 Electricity: $60 to $150\n\n\u2022 Water and trash pickup: $0 to $25\n\n\u2022 Gas for cooking, heating etc.: $0 to $10\n\n\u2022 Supermarket (mix of local and imported food and household items): $400 to $500\n\n\u2022 Entertainment for two (movies twice a month with snacks; dinner out four times a month): $140 to $400\n\n\u2022 Phone: $13 to $20\n\n\u2022 High-speed internet: $20 to $45\n\n\u2022 Cable or satellite TV: $35 to $50\n\n\u2022 Transportation (taxis or fuel for compact car): $75 to $200\n\n\u2022 Total: $1,553 to $2,600 a month\n\niStock Rainbow over Boquete.\n\nThe pensionado program: \u201cThe pensionado visa is the most popular visa for retirees,\u201d says Jackie Lange, an expat since 2010 who now runs a Panama relocation program \u2014 and it gives retirees throughout Panama deep discounts on everything from airfare to restaurants. An American retiree collecting Social Security can apply for the \u201cPanama Pensionado Visa,\u201d as long as he or she has regular income of at least $1,000 a month, or income of at least $750 a month and buys property for at least $100,000. When you qualify you get lots of perks including 50% off entertainment anywhere in the country (movies, concerts, sports); 30% off bus, boat and train fares; 25% off on airline tickets; between 30% and 50% off hotel stays; 25% off at restaurants; 15% off hospital bills; 10% off prescriptions; 20% off medical consultations; and 15% off dental and eye exams.\n\nMary loves the program. When she shops or picks up medications, the clerk \u201ccalls me a jubiloso \u2014 it means a jubilant person \u2014 that\u2019s where they get the word for retiree,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a 10% discount at the pharmacy, I give them my old box of whatever, and they give me a new one. In and out in five minutes. Even my dogs and cats get a discount on medication.\n\nResidency: \u201cIt\u2019s a daunting process,\u201d Mary says \u2014 adding that she got a lawyer to help her navigate it. The process takes months, has \u201cmany, many steps,\u201d and is, in her estimation, \u201cimpossible for an outsider to navigate\u201d alone. Her advice is that you \u201cfollow your lawyer\u2019s directions, provide what s/he asks for, and show up in Panama at their direction and do what they say.\u201d She says that getting a driver\u2019s license in Panama is also complicated. These resources can help youget started.\n\nHealth care: Health care in Panama is considered good for the region (particularly in Panama City, which has a number of respected hospitals and is about an hour\u2019s flight from Boquete), and the country ranks in the top 100 in the world in terms of quality and access to health care for its residents.\n\nMary has catastrophic health insurance from Cigna International, and says she pays roughly $2,000 a year for it. In Panama, she pays out of pocket for her occasional doctor\u2019s visits (about $20); her inhaler (she has asthma) costs $20 at the local pharmacy with the retiree discount, and her sleep meds cost about $10 for a two month\u2019s supply, she says. \u201cDoctors here are well-trained and efficient,\u201d she says \u2014 adding that she communicates with them via WhatsApp if she needs anything.\n\nThe cons of living in Panama: Though Panama has better roads and infrastructure than plenty of other Central and South American nations, some rural areas are still lacking. And Americans used to prompt customer service might be struggle to adapt to the slower pace of life in Panama. You also can\u2019t always get all the goods you do in the States. Mary jokes that the one thing she misses most are \u201cTemptations cat treats \u2026 much to the chagrin of expat cat owners far and wide!\u201d\n\nBottom line: Mary stays busy by being on the board of directors at an animal-rescue nonprofit, Salvadores de Animales. She loves the food and activities in the country. But it\u2019s the friendly Panamanian spirit that truly sold Mary on it. \u201cPanamanians celebrate many more holidays than in the U.S., and there are typically parades with music and horses. It was explained to me that \u2018Panamanians like each other and we like to get together to celebrate our lives,\u2019 which is why there are so many celebrations,\u201d she says. \u201cI enjoy being in a place where people like each other.\u201d", "description": "You can live on about $2,000 a month, experts says, and Panama has a generous \u2018pensionado program.\u2019 But there are drawbacks.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP998_maryta_MG_20190822154759.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
