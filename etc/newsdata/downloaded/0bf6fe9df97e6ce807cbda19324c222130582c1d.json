Some examples include the polar lights, coronal mass ejections, and geomagnetic storms. A number of space weather events occur when charged particles from the sun enter the upper most region\u2019s of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nRadiation from the sun ionizes the particles in ionosphere creating a layer of electrons that can vary substantially during solar cycles\u2014the 11 year-period it takes for the Sun's north and south poles switch positions.\n\nICON had originally been planned for a 2017 launch but a series of mechanical failures led to a number of delays.\n\nThe launch will be carried out from another aircraft already inflight, a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar craft named Stargazer.\n\nLast year, the ESA's Met Office issued a warning that one particularly devastating form of space weather, a solar storm, is inevitable and could devastate Earth's power grids and communication networks.\n\nIn 1859, a large solar storm, called The Carrington Event, caused streams of fire to come out of telegraph equipment and turned the sky blood red.", "description": "A new NASA research satellite is set to launch, with the goal of learning more about the mysteries of space weather, which causes the norther lights and other unusual atmospheric phenomena.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19556862-0-image-a-38_1570739410138.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
