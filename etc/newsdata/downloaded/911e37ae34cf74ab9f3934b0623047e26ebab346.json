While most domestic tortoises usually only live between 10-80 years, others are thought to be able to live far longer. The oldest tortoise on record was called Adwaita, who lived at the Alipore Zooilogical Gardens in Kolkata, India. Staff believed Adwaita was around 250 years old when he died in 2006. Although Alagba's age does seem staggering, some tortoise conservationists believe that some of the creatures can live for 500 years.\n\nPrivate Secretary to Oba Oyewumi, Toyin Ajamu, told the Daily Post that the staff members who looked after Alagba 'provided food, health support and other logistics, so as to make sure she gets the best treatment'.\n\nHe added: 'On a daily basis, Alagba had tourists visiting her from different parts of the world.\n\n'The palace household, Ogbomoso community and stakeholders in the tourism sector are mourning Alagba\u2019s passage.'\n\nOther than Alagba, the oldest known tortoise was Adwaita - an aldabra giant tortoise that died in 2006 and is believed to have been 250 years old.\n\nAdwaita, lived at the Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata, India, was supposedly born around 1750 and was one of four tortoises that was brought back to India by British sailors from the Seychelles as a gift for Lord Clive.", "description": "Alagba, meaning 'Elder', the tortoise died today after suffering from an illness.
