Trading opportunities, or trade setups, generally fall into four broad categories: continuation, reversal, breakout and range bound. Each presents opportunity if you are able to identify the setup and have strategies for capitalizing on it. In this class, we will learn how to take advantage of the most popular technical setups and identify trend patterns. Trading with the trend is successful, and it is also that a trader will be able to spot when a trend is potentially ending, and a new one beginning.Knowing a number of ways to recognize triangles, channels, head and should, gaps and triple tops and bottom setups provides you with tools to handle nearly every market condition you\u2019ll face. Keep in mind that these setups are not mutually exclusive; understanding the nature of trends will help you notice when a range is forming and knowing about breakouts can make you more aware of the implications of a trading within a range. The price action of an asset is always the most critical element of analysis and trading.The Director of Investors Trading Academy as well as a published author and educator.
