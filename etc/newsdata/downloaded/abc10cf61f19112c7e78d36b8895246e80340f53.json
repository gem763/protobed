England were here in Portugal to play possession football, no results would change that, not even a five-game winless run. \"I'm not afraid to lose,\" he said.\n\nThey did not lose, they kept their first clean sheet since the World Cup quarter-final and they had over 70 per cent of the ball. But this performance, in an unconvincing 1-0 win over a team ranked 26 places below them in the world, Neville's narrative is starting to feel worn-out.\n\nThat it took until only 65 minutes for him to resort to risking Jordan Nobbs - a player only just back from an 11-month injury who he had said at the weekend he would not use here - was an indication of the desperate times the Lionesses are living in. And Beth Mead's goal midway through the second half only marginally changed that. But Neville remained adamant his team were performing at the top level.\n\n\u201cWe never worried about the five games without a victory,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wear my heart on my sleeve and I think over the past two games we played brilliant football.\u201d", "description": "Portugal 0 England 1", "authors": ["Molly Mcelwee", "Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212451004-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqCHco2f1jjYcmYrb_Lt46Uq5aS0a8yGD2ZYerHXFmKFM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
