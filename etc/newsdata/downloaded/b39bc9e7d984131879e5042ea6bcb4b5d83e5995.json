Have you reached out to any African leaders or any leaders of the Middle East to apologize for your conduct?\n\nPRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: Canada will continue to engage in a positive, constructive way around the world; standing up for human rights, engaging with leaders right around the world because we know promoting our values and prosperity for everyone around the world is good for Canadians and creates better opportunities for everyone.\n\nBEXTE: That didn\u2019t answer the question at all. Have you spoken to any African leaders or leaders from the Middle East to apologize for your personal conduct?\n\nPRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: I have continued to engage with leaders around the world in a responsible way. During the election campaign, my focus is connecting with Canadians as I was able to tonight. I was pleased to see so many of the questions turned to the environment. In all sections, there was a clear contrast between those on stage who don\u2019t think we should be fighting climate change and those of us who do. Again, the [Liberal Party] is the only party with a clear plan to fight climate change.", "description": "Justin Trudeau awkwardly dodged questions regarding his blackface scandal\u00a0by talking about so-called climate change.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1174359614-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
