I always thought that going forward you would have an economic core which would revolve around Germany - the main economic powerhouse in the Eurozone - and then it made sense to have a defence and security core that Britain would lead.\"\n\nOn the party's new position of revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit if the Lib Dems win power, Mr Umunna said it was a way of ending the chaos.\n\nThe policy is designed to distinguish the party's central Brexit message from others at Westminster, and ensure they are the most fervently Remain-supporting party at the next election, which could occur as early as November.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I think it's perfectly legitimate for us to treat a clear mandate given to a Liberal Democrat government as authority to revoke Article 50. I think that is absolutely justified.\n\n\"Can you imagine if we go to say to poor Brenda from Bristol after that general election, we're going to send you back to the ballot box again. I think in those circumstances it would be completely legitimate.\"\n\nThe ex-Labour MP, who joined the Liberal Democrats in June, also praised the reception he received at this year's annual conference, as he described it as a \"homecoming\".\n\n\"The last decade I've been going to the annual conferences that I've had to go to - let's just put it that way. You're about to enter a hostile environment. I never got a reception like this in the Labour Party, even before the days of Jeremy Corbyn.\"", "description": "Liberal Democrats should support the UK rejoining the European Union if Brexit takes place, the party's foreign affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna has said.", "authors": ["Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/18/dsc-7784.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
