The two smartphones haven't been the best kept secret, between Google trying to get ahead of the leaks earlier this year, and the onslaught of videos, pictures, spec sheets and even the official boxes leaking ahead of the official announcement.\n\nTrue to the leaks, the Pixel 4 has two cameras on the back, and no longer has a two-tone look.\n\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\nThe Pixel 4 will include a new face unlock feature that automatically turns on when you pick up the phone, allowing for quick authentication. Project Soli, the radar platform that's used for hand gestures to control the phone without touching it, is also include. You can use the new Motion Sense system to control music playback, or the phone can automatically disable the always-on display when it detects that you're no longer at your desk, for example.\n\nGoogle Assistant also received an update, with a new animation at the bottom of the screen, and the ability to continue taking commands in context with the previous command. For example, you can ask Google to search for an artists tour schedule, and then have the results sent to a friend with just saying \"send to [contact name]\".\n\nThere's a new recorder app for voice memos that can also live transcribe text, and it's all done on device \u2014 so none of your conversations are sent to the cloud for transcription.\n\nThe display has a 90Hz refresh rate that auto-adjusts depending on what you're doing. It's a similar feature that the OnePlus 7 Pro and 7T offers.\n\nPre-orders start today, with shipments arriving Oct. 24. The Pixel 4 is priced at $799. Google didn't mention Pixel 4 XL pricing.\n\nThe headlining feature of all Pixel phones, outside of consistent software updates, has been its cameras. With the Pixel 4, Google has added a second camera to the back of the phone. The Pixel 4 has a 2x telephoto lens, in addition to the standard camera. The cameras use Google's Super Res Zoom image processing to capture clearer zoomed-in photos.\n\nThe new camera setup will have a dual-exposure control, improved white balance for truer colors, and an improved portrait mode. The addition of the second camera has allowed Google to better detect depth, for improved bokeh.\n\nNight Sight has, of course, also received an update, adding the capability to take photos of a starry sky at night.\n\nGoogle is currently walking us through the Pixel 4, keep refreshing for more updates.\n\nBelow is what we expect Google to announce, but anything could change.\n\nWhat about the specs?\n\n\n\n9to5Google was able to get their hands on what it claims is the official spec sheet for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 specs\n\nDisplay: 5.7-inch Full HD+ Smooth Display (up to 90Hz OLED) -- Ambient EQ\n\nBattery: 2,800mAh\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, Pixel Neural Core\n\nMemory: 6GB RAM\n\nStorage: 64GB, 128GB\n\nCameras: 12MP Dual-Pixel and 16MP Telephoto\n\nAudio: Stereo speakers\n\nSecurity: Titan M Security Module\n\nFeatures: Face unlock, Motion Sense\n\nOS: Android OS with three years of security and OS updates\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 XL specs\n\nDisplay: 6.3-inch Quad HD+ Smooth Display (up to 90Hz OLED) -- Ambient EQ\n\nBattery: 3,700mAh\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, Pixel Neural Core\n\nMemory: 6GB RAM\n\nStorage: 64GB, 128GB\n\nCameras: 12MP Dual-Pixel and 16MP Telephoto\n\nAudio: Stereo speakers\n\nSecurity: Titan M Security Module\n\nFeatures: Face unlock, Motion Sense\n\nOS: Android OS with three years of security and OS updates\n\nPerhaps the most notable aspect of the spec sheet is that the Pixel 4 will have a 90Hz display, which should make common tasks like gaming and scrolling through your Facebook feel smoother.", "description": "Google just announced its latest smartphones, after months of leaks.", "authors": ["Jason Cipriani"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/15/9ffcf16c-cf75-4275-be7d-9adea56c25e1/thumbnail/770x578/73bc9e30efe39e07226d3ffa8ff679f5/6260689e-0a0e-4010-8d03-9483dca21707.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
