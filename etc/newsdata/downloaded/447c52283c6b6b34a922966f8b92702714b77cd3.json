USA TODAY\n\nThe arrival of October means the push for conference titles throughout college football is now in full swing. While several Top 25 teams have the week off, there are still plenty of meaningful contests worthy of your attention.\n\nHere are the five Saturday games that will have the biggest impact on the playoff picture in Week 6.\n\nNo. 7 Auburn at No. 8 Florida\n\nSaturday, 3:30 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nIn theory, this clash of undefeated SEC hopefuls isn\u2019t a make-or-break proposition. In reality, however, both teams still have to face LSU and Georgia, and Auburn also has that annual tilt with Alabama on the docket. Suffice it to say that whoever doesn\u2019t come out on top in this one will have an extremely hard time winning the conference, and therefore a severely complicated path to the playoff.\n\nFlorida quarterback Kyle Trask looks to throw the ball during the second half against Towson at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.

RB JaTarvious Whitlow remains a constant breakaway threat as well, though the Florida ground defense, anchored by LB David Reese II, is holding opponents under three yards per attempt. Gators QB Kyle Trask has done a good job stepping in for injured starter Feleipe Franks, but the aforementioned Auburn defense will pose the toughest challenge of his career to date. The centerpiece is LB K.J. Britt, an excellent run stuffer who can be sent on blitzes as well.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nWEEKEND FORECAST: Staff picks for Auburn-Florida and every big game\n\nHOT SEAT: Eight coaches feeling pressure after the first month of season\n\nNo. 14 Iowa at No. 18 Michigan\n\nSaturday, noon ET, Fox\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Wisconsin solidified its position as the perceived team to beat in the Big Ten West by throttling cross-division contender Michigan. Iowa now makes its attempt to take down those same Wolverines, who got a needed bounce-back performance against lowly Rutgers following the disastrous outing against the Badgers but could now use a win against a quality team to avoid falling out of the conference title picture altogether.\n\nVeteran Iowa QB Nate Stanley has been sound through his first four games, tossing eight TD passes without a pick. The tandem of RBs Mekhi Sargent and Toren Young provides good ground support. Containing them will be a priority for LB Khaleke Hudson and the Michigan front that hasn\u2019t always been airtight against the run. Wolverines QB Shea Patterson accounted for four touchdowns, three by land, in the rout of Rutgers but must still show he can solve a strong defense. He won\u2019t face much of a pass rush, but Iowa LBs Kristian Welch and Djimon Colbert aren\u2019t likely to let him scramble much.\n\nNo. 23 Michigan State at No. 5 Ohio State\n\nSaturday, 7:30 p.m. ET, ABC\n\nThe Buckeyes have shredded each of their first five opponents by an average victory margin of 52.4-8.6 - more than six touchdowns - and been ruthlessly efficient on both sides of the ball. But now for the first time, they\u2019ll face an accomplished defense that might be able to slow them down a bit. The Michigan State offense hasn\u2019t been nearly as prolific but has shown improvement since being shut down by Arizona State.\n\nWhat Ohio State QB Justin Fields has done with his arm, 16 TD tosses without an interception and 1,092 passing yards, is scary enough. But his speed that also requires attention from opposing defenses has allowed RB J.K. Dobbins to average over seven yards a carry himself, though Spartans LB Joe Bachie and DE Kenny Willekes could bring that average down a touch. Michigan State QB Brian Lewerke doesn\u2019t have as many weapons at his disposal, but he makes few mistakes and keeps the sticks moving with a healthy average of 7.6 yards per pass attempt. The problem for MSU is the Ohio State defense has been just as dominant, with DE Chase Young and LB Malik Harrison making life extremely difficult for opposing passers.\n\nCalifornia at No. 13 Oregon\n\nSaturday, 8 p.m. ET, Fox\n\nThe Golden Bears\u2019 setback against Arizona State last week left the Pac-12 with no unbeaten teams heading into October. But Cal does still own a huge win at Washington and now seeks an improbable road sweep of the teams expected to battle for the North Division crown. The Ducks, still unscathed in league play, aren\u2019t terribly interested in letting the Bears stay in the hunt.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help Cal\u2019s cause against the Sun Devils when QB Chase Garbers went out with a shoulder injury. Devon Modster couldn\u2019t generate much through the air, so Bears\u2019 fans must hope he can do better with a week of preparation. He\u2019ll need to provide some cover for RB Christopher Brown Jr., who figures to have his hands full trying to get past Ducks LB Troy Dye. Oregon will come in rested after a 21-6 win at Stanford two weeks ago. Oregon senior QB Justin Herbert has 14 TD throws and no picks to date in 2019, but S Ashtyn Davis and the Cal secondary have surrendered just two scoring passes this season.\n\nNo. 12 Texas at West Virginia\n\nSaturday, 3:30 p.m. ET, ABC\n\nWe\u2019re a week away from the Red River showdown that will likely once again be a Big 12 title game preview, but the Longhorns have this road trip to survive first. OK, Oklahoma is on the road as well, but the Sooners\u2019 scoring machine doesn\u2019t figure to slow much at Kansas. The Mountaineers could prove more of a challenge for Texas as both teams look to avoid absorbing a second early loss.\n\nThough his team was outdueled by LSU\u2019s Joe Burrow, Texas QB Sam Ehlinger was nothing short of spectacular through September, throwing for 15 TDs and running for another. Much to the relief of his coaches, he hasn\u2019t needed to take off as much this season thanks to RB Keaontay Ingram. They\u2019ll both give LB Josh Chandler and the West Virginia defense a major challenge. QB Austin Kendall and the Mountaineers got out of the gate slowly this season, but the unit has performed better in its last two outings. Freshman WR Sam James has emerged as the primary target who will be the main concern for the occasionally leaky Texas secondary that will be without several contributors, including S Caden Sterns.", "description": "Week 6 has several intriguing games that will impact the College Football Playoff, led by Florida-Auburn, Ohio State-Michigan and Iowa-Michigan.", "authors": ["Eddie Timanus", "Published A.M.
