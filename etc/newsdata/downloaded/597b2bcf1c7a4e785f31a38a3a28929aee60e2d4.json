Deadline reported this afternoon that HBO is about to close a deal with George R.R. Martin and Colony co-creator Ryan Condal for a new Thrones prequel pilot, and it\u2019s said to be \u201cset 300 years before the events in Game of Thrones and tracks the beginning of the end for House Targaryen.\u201d Condal is attached to write the pilot, which according to Deadline would be based on Martin\u2019s book Fire & Blood and was teased earlier this by the author on his blog. Back in May, he wrote that three of the five original Thrones spin-off concepts that HBO started considering a few years ago were still progressing. \u201cTwo other shows remain in the script stage, but are edging closer,\u201d Martin wrote. \u201cWhat are they about? I cannot say. But maybe some of you should pick up a copy of Fire & Blood and come up with your own theories.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another pilot set in the Age of Heroes era of the Thrones mythology that stars Naomi Watts, and that one has already gone into production. This possible Targaryen series is the second one we\u2019ve heard about getting this far into development, but there is likely still more yet to come.", "description": "HBO is reportedly close to a deal for another Game of Thrones pilot prequel order, and it would take place hundreds of years before the Thrones series timeline and be centered around House Targaryen.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/05/06/06-daenerys-got.w1200.h630.jpg"}
