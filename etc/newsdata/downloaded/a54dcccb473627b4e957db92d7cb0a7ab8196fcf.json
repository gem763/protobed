Despite its gorgeous location on the corner of Bedford and Grove Streets in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village, the restaurant \u2014 which operates breakfast, lunch, and dinner service \u2014 hasn\u2019t fed into the Friends tourism frenzy it found itself a part of since opening in 2006. (For the uninitiated, the corner served as the primary exterior for many of the characters\u2019 apartments in the sitcom.) It\u2019s pretty much the opposite: Owner and chef Joey Campanaro wasn\u2019t aware of the significance of the location when he signed the lease, only realizing that something was afoot when busloads of people were dropped off to gawk at the building at any given time. Now, he estimates he deals with \u201c1,000, maybe more\u201d tourists standing at that corner every single day.\n\nThe majority of these Friends fans, Campanaro tells Vulture, are respectful during their pilgrimages, and just want to snap a photo or take in the beauty of the neighborhood. However, some bad behavior has cropped up over the years, and dealing with inconsiderate fans has become an integral part of the duties of Little Owl\u2019s staff. With the show celebrating its 25th anniversary this month, Vulture sat down with Campanaro \u2014 at the restaurant, of course \u2014 to learn more about how being located at a major tourism hub affects business. He has a great David Schwimmer story, too.\n\nWere you aware of the history of this street corner when you leased the property?\n\nNot at all. I had no idea why hundreds and hundreds of people were gathering on that corner. The owner of the French restaurant that was here beforehand also didn\u2019t know. I had to eavesdrop on a tour group and figure out what it was. No red flags came up when I was researching the building. Obviously, when you take over a lease on a building, you do due diligence on what you\u2019re getting yourself into. Any open violations, things like that. Not even a Google search brought up any relationship to Friends. It was never a business decision based on Friends to lease this space.\n\nWhen did you eavesdrop on that tour group?\n\nWe opened in the spring, so, naturally, there\u2019s more people on the street during those nice-weather months. It was a Wednesday morning and there had to be 400 people on that corner. It was unbelievable. I just didn\u2019t understand. When the person in the tour group told me it was the Friends building, my first reaction was, \u201cOh, that\u2019s cute.\u201d\n\nDo overzealous fans often wander into the restaurant to take photos?\n\n\ufeffOnce in awhile, tourists will come into the restaurant and say in very heavy accents, \u201cIs this the building of the Friends?\u201d They ask to buy coffee mostly. I mean, we sell $5 cups of coffee on the menu, and they\u2019re not to-go. We have to pay the West Village rent. The restaurant is reserved for people who want to eat. Some people get upset that this wasn\u2019t Central Perk, or that it wasn\u2019t about Friends. It\u2019s a neighborhood restaurant with zero pretension. The economics of it all is you have to pay the rent. Not one tourist has come in here expecting to hear that very realistic news. [Laughs.] They\u2019re looking for that orange couch.\n\nWould you say that the fans, overall, are respectful toward the restaurant and don\u2019t cause too much trouble?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes. A few stories of bad behavior stick out, though. A good buddy of mine does graffiti, and about four years ago, he came to the restaurant one night and I bought him dinner \u2014 free pork chop on the house. When he walked out, he was carrying a piece of sidewalk chalk with him and wrote \u201cI love Joey\u201d on a wall outdoors. It was for me, not Joey Tribbiani. He didn\u2019t know the Friends connection either, I think. Little by little, people started defacing the property with \u201cPivot!\u201d and \u201cJoey doesn\u2019t share food!\u201d and \u201cWe were on a break!\u201d Soon, it stretched over the entire building. People had the audacity to come in and ask for Sharpies.\n\nUltimately, I felt like I was responsible for it and I had to remove it all. \u201cAnnoying\u201d might not be the right word, but the fact that fans think that type of thing is okay is scary. When I explained to these people they couldn\u2019t do it, they were like, \u201cWhat about all these other people?\u201d I was like, \u201cIf everybody jumps off a bridge, would you jump off the bridge?\u201d You know that bridge in Paris with all of those locks? It was just like that. There\u2019s no demographic to it, either. It\u2019s people in their sixties to little kids.\n\nWas that graffiti incident the worst fan behavior, in your experience?\n\nI\u2019ve been yelled at a lot because it\u2019s not Central Perk. I\u2019ve been called stupid. The repetitiveness is expected at this point. I sense it in the staff, too. We\u2019re in a hospitality-driven business and to say \u201cno\u201d over and over and over again is taxing.\n\nDo you include Friends-related scenarios in your staff training?\n\nNo, not specifically. If someone comes in and asks a question, obviously we\u2019re going to respond, \u201cYes, this is the Friends building, welcome.\u201d I encourage the staff to embrace it in public. I can\u2019t control what they do behind closed doors.\n\nHave you ever thought about really capitalizing on your location for Friends fans? Like, themed dinners?\n\nI\u2019ve never decided to \u201ccapitalize\u201d in the strongest sense of the word. The only thing I\u2019ve done, occasionally, was sell coffee mugs with a picture of the building on it. I sell them with permission from the landlord. That\u2019s not totally specific to Friends, though.\n\nHave any of the Friends actors dined at the restaurant?\n\nDavid Schwimmer came here a few years ago wearing a hat. He was sitting right by the front window \u2014 a super-visible spot to anyone passing by. I offered to move his seat and he looked at me like I was crazy. I was like, \u201cHey, lots of people take photos here, it might be better if you moved.\u201d He had no idea where he was. [Laughs.] Once he saw 100 people walk to the corner, he took me up on my offer. His immediate switch from bewilderment to appreciation was amusing. I took the risk of pissing him off to protect him! He hasn\u2019t been back since.\n\nDo you see yourself at this location indefinitely?\n\nThat\u2019s my plan. I don\u2019t want to go anywhere.", "description": "The Little Owl is the restaurant below the Friends apartment, and fans of the show frequently visit the location to show their love for the show.
