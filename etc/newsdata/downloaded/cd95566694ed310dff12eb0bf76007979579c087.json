Uber customers tip on just 16% of rides, the paper concluded after analyzing 40 million rides. However, the average tip is $3.11, or one quarter of their fare.\n\nGender also interacts with age, with men tipping younger women more than they tip any other group. Drivers in cities who, presumably, are less likely to see their driver again tipped less.\n\n\u201cWomen are tipped more than men, and men tip more than women do,\u2019 the authors of the study wrote. \u201cGender also interacts with age, with men tipping younger women more than they tip any other group.\u201d Drivers in urban areas who, presumably, are less likely to see their driver again tipped less, they added. The higher quality of the ride, the more people tip.\n\nThe results support the theory that giving people a selection of suggested tips impacts how much they\u2019ll tip and whether they\u2019ll tip at all. \u201cIn particular, higher default options tend to lead to higher tip levels on average, but they also lead to a higher percentage of trips that do not get tipped at all,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis result is consonant with the tipping literature that argues social norms drive tipping.\u201d\n\nSource: Becker Friedman Institute for Economics at the University of Chicago\n\nUber riders are less likely than taxi-cab customers to tip more when faced with default tipping options. Uber riders are given the option to add a suggested tip only after they get out of the car.\n\nWhen the tipping decision is made privately, however, defaults play less of a role in the tipping decision, the study concluded. Average tips as a percentage of the fare increased by just 2.5% between the lowest and highest default options. However, previous research has shown that providing customers with options increases the average tip in taxi cabs by 10%.\n\n\u201cThe strength of social nudges, or any particular course of action brought about through social norms, is diminished without public verification of an action,\u201d the UChicago study found. Customers may be more likely to tip more to avoid feeling awkward or stingy for the few moments it takes them to exit a taxi cab. Uber customers are prompted to tip after they have gotten out of the car.\n\nAlso see: Is this the worst tipper in America?\n\nHere\u2019s what else the study found:\n\n\u2022 Some 60% of ride-share customers never tip, while only 1% always tip.\n\n\u2022 Men tip on 17% of trips, while women tip on 14.3% of trips.\n\n\u2022 Women drivers are tipped up to 12% more than male drivers.\n\n\u2022 But men and women drivers aged 65 and over are tipped at the same rate.\n\n\u2022 Uber customers tip better from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., and on Fridays and Saturdays at 6 p.m.\n\n\u2022 Riders with 5-star ratings tip more than twice as often as those with 4.75-star ratings.\n\nSource: Becker Friedman Institute for Economics at the University of Chicago\n\nMillions of drivers now serve the ride-share market, the authors said, \u201cand debit- and credit-card data suggest that by 2018 as many as 43% of American adults tried ride-share at least once.\u201d The paper examined UberX trips from Aug. 18, 2017 to Sept. 14, 2017, and analysis was restricted to six cities: Chicago, Boston and San Francisco (as three large cities in different regions); Salt Lake City and Asheville, N.C.; as well as college town Bloomington, Ind.\n\nUber customers tip on just 16% of rides, he concluded, after analyzing 40 million rides. However, the average tip is $3.11, approximately one quarter of their fare.\n\n\u201cField experiments provide an empirical look at consumer behavior that wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise,\u201d said List, the Kenneth C. Griffin Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at UChicago. \u201cIn this case, we found clear differences in tipping behavior informed by environmental and demographic factors, such as gender, age and race.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, we were able to go beyond simple measurement and answer the \u2018whys\u2019 behind tipping,\u201d he added, according to a statement provided by the University of Chicago. \u201cIn so doing, we can provide a unique glimpse of social preferences in the field and provide insights into how norms and defaults work in tandem to change behaviors.\u201d\n\nThe paper was co-authored by economist Uri Gneezy of the University of California, San Diego; UChicago alumni Bharat Chandar, currently a doctoral student at Stanford University; and Ian Muir, who now works at Lyft LYFT, -0.27%, and is a former Uber UBER, +1.56% employee who still retains equity in that company.\n\nSource: Becker Friedman Institute for Economics at the University of Chicago\n\n\u201cEven though social preferences affect nearly every facet of life, there exist many open questions on the economics of social preferences in markets,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe leverage a unique opportunity to generate a large data set to inform the who\u2019s, what\u2019s, where\u2019s, and when\u2019s of social preferences through the lens of a nationwide tipping field experiment on the Uber platform.\u201d\n\nSimilar to the Uber study, other research suggests that older people tip more. Over half of Americans aged 65 and over tip 20% or more at restaurants, the highest of any age group.\n\nPrevious research suggests that older customers are often the most generous tippers, especially when it comes to ride-share services. \u201cGive as if you were taking,\u201d Hisham Matar, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the memoir \u201cThe Return,\u201d said his late father advised him. But not everyone follows that rule when dealing with members of the service industry, according to separate research.\n\nSimilar to the Uber study, other research shows that older people are more likely to tip more. More than half of Americans aged 65 and over tip 20% or more at restaurants, the highest of any age group, a recent survey released by CreditCards.com found. Women are better tippers than men and baby boomers are more generous tippers than millennials, according to the survey.\n\nNor does it matter whether it\u2019s an Uber ride or a food delivery: Older Americans appear to be more generous tippers. Baby boomers are more likely than millennials to tip restaurant servers and taxi or ride-share drivers (63% versus 40%), hair stylists (73% versus 53%), food delivery (72% versus 56%) and hotel housekeepers (33% versus 23%).\n\nThe default tips on Uber nudge people to tip, something the latest study found is not yet a social norm. When people are unsure whether or not they should leave a gratuity, they often don\u2019t tip.\n\nWhy the differences? \u201cConventional wisdom says that if you have more money, you tip more,\u201d said Ted Rossman, an industry analyst at CreditCards.com. \u201cSo maybe boomers have saved more money, or they have higher salaries if they\u2019re still working.\u201d For many people, tipping is a source of anxiety, he added.\n\nThe default tips on Uber nudge people to tip, something the latest study found is not yet a social norm. When people are unsure whether or not they should leave a gratuity, they often don\u2019t tip. Case in point: More than half of U.S. adults (53%) said they give their kids\u2019 teachers or child-care providers holiday tips at least on occasion, the CreditCards.com survey found. But a majority of people said they never give their trash/recycling collectors or mail carriers holiday gratuities.", "description": "A group of economists also found that male and female drivers are not tipped at the same rate.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GP796_airpor_ZG_20180910135414.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
