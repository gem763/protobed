Any other issues that you have, disapproving of the way the president has dealt with Syria, whatever the subject is, reluctance, the cowardice to do something about gun violence, the cruelty of not wanting to help our Dreamers and transgender people, the denial about the climate crisis that we face, the list goes on, that\u2019s about the election. That has nothing to do with what is happening in terms of our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution and the facts that might support. And we don\u2019t know where this path will take us, it could take us down further path but the two are completely separate.\u201d\n\nA reporter asked, \u201cAt what point might you say let\u2019s just let the voters decide.\u201d\n\nPelosi said, \u201cThe voters are not going to decide whether we honor our oath of office. They already decided that in the last election.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Thursday at her weekly press briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said the\u00a0American people were \"not going to decide\" if President Donald Trump | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Nancy-Pelosi-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
