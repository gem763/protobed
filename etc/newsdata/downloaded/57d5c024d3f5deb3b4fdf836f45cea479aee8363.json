Our latest product feature, My Topics, lets readers create their own experience with a customized headline feed and an option for automatic push notifications when USA TODAY publishes new stories about their selected topics.\n\n\u201cThe USA TODAY app is known for its signature alerts, which Apple featured as \u2018turbo-charged\u2019 and Digiday named a Mobile Innovation Award finalist,\u201d said Jason Jedlinski, VP Product Management, USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cOur users enjoy the notifications triggered by our editors and tell us they want additional alerts about the people, places and subjects that matter to them. We\u2019re pleased to answer that request.\u201d\n\nMy Topics is available for new installs and users who upgrade to version 5.8. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nEach article features a primary topic beneath the headline, along with an \u201cAdd to My Topics\u201d button.\n\nUsers have the option to enable automatic push notifications for each topic.\n\nWithin the My Topics list, users will see all articles tagged with topics they\u2019ve added.\n\nThey can manage their topics and see a list of topics recommended by USA TODAY editors.\n\n\u201cFor many of our mobile app users, we\u2019re already a daily habit,\u201d Jedlinski added. \u201cThere\u2019s a segment of our audience who read more than a thousand stories each month and therefore My Topics is the next logical step to reward and encourage deeper engagement.\u201d\n\nMy Topics will be expanded to other USA TODAY NETWORK mobile apps this summer.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2s26l1Q", "description": "USA TODAY is introducing a personalized newsfeed and tailored alerts for its loyal mobile app audience.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published A.M.
