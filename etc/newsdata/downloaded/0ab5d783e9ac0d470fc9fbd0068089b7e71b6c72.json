Fuelled by record prices, the miners responded rapidly to market signals and invested heavily. And yes, mistakes were made and shareholder wealth was occasionally wasted.\n\nBut not all was lost through in that era of excessive exuberance. The boom also built a bigger base of supply that will be harvested ever more efficiently over coming generations, making shareholders and nations richer.\n\nAnd that, in the end, is why the miners have been able to afford the $US400 million of capital returns made mostly through the latter half of this decade.\n\nIn his keynote address, Jacques offered his five big lessons from the resources sector\u2019s tumultuous opening to the 21st century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first and most important is that \u201cvolume growth for the sale of it and mega M &A do not equal value creation\u201d, and there is \u201creal strength in discipline\u201d.\n\nJean-Sebastien Jacques says miners of the future 'will face greater regulation and scrutiny'. Bloomberg\n\n\u201cWith slow global economic growth likely, at least in the years ahead, the appetite for risk-taking in our industry will be low and non-organic growth will be harder to come by,\u201d he forecast.\n\n\u201cAll-in-all, I think a different way of looking at \u2018growth\u2019 will be needed.''\n\nJacques offered a three-tiered template for the industry and its investors to measure growth: growth in free cash flow for share, growth through development of new resources, and growth in new profit pools born of innovation.\n\nThis risk aversion is likely to demand a new approach to the mega-projects that are such a feature of the resources sector. But when they are necessary they \u201cmay need the United Nations of investors to reduce risk and leverage different capabilities,\u201d Jacques said.\n\nThe Book of JS\n\nAll of that leads neatly to the second big lesson in the Book of JS: China is not just a customer, \"It is a major developer, potential partner and competitor''.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn some ways, we underestimate China as a new entrant in the industry, as a developer and an owner of mines. Who knows who may enter our industry next? Tesla? Google? Alibaba?\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that this idea of sectoral disruption from seemingly unexpected corners of the global economy is a theme that Jacques continues to ponder publicly.\n\nThere is familiarity too with the third lesson of our mining times, which is that \u201cbig might not necessarily be beautiful\u201d, before offering up the Winu copper discovery in Western Australia\u2019s north-west as a project that might benefit from a more agile approach to project planning.\n\n\u201cIn terms of resource development, maybe the majors also need to think more like fast moving juniors,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of looking for the big bang, maximum NPV (net present value) development options, perhaps we should look to stage-gate investments, starting smaller mines, which can be built quickly and safely with embedded optionality for growth.\n\n\u201cShorter build means quicker cash flows to shareholders, communities and governments, de-risking additional investment decisions,\u201d he said, before admitting to a level of frustration at the difficulties of forcing evolutionary change on a 146-year-old business.\n\nLesson four, according to Jacques, is that the industry is going to be defined and redefined by its partnerships and its ability to thrive in a \u201cnew sustainability age\u201d. He later nominated broad partnerships as the only effective pathway to climate change mitigation.\n\n\u201cAnd lastly, we must be better tuned-in to the changing world around us. We must adapt as we have been doing for a century or more, but we need to do it quicker than ever before to stay on the front foot.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe future will be....\n\nSo what does the future of mining look like?\n\nWell, Jacques sees it as an ever more complex place. \u201cThere is absolutely no doubt in my mind we will face greater regulation and scrutiny, a war for talent and new competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo 2003-2013 were about excess, the late 2010s about discipline, perhaps the 2020s will be more about strength and resilience,\u201d he said, before recommending that the industry \u201cneeds to drive its own agenda\u201d.\n\nInterestingly, the man that is building the world\u2019s first thinking mine, that is deploying new bulk mining technologies in Mongolia and that imagines a remotely operated future for a copper mine two kilometres deep below the surface of an Arizona desert said that \u201dtruly transformative\u201d technological change has proven scarce in the mining business.\n\nFor the historians out there, Jacques nominated the mechanisation of mining between 1890-1910 and the breakthroughs in aluminium and copper processing through the 1950s as rare examples of tech game-changers.\n\nUntil recently, since then it was all about getting bigger and moving ever more tonnes. But the mining world is being tilted on its axis by new technologies and new ways of thinking. Jacques cited automation and China\u2019s low capital model as steps forward, before recommending that \u201cdigital platforms\u201d will bring mining to its next frontier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScaling down\n\nWith that Jacques offered what we can only assume is informed speculation about the way technology will allow Rio Tinto\u2019s Pilbara iron ore business to prosper beyond peak demand in China.\n\n\u201cAs demand for some materials remains flat or declines and the circular economy (a new-fangled way of saying recycling) takes hold, the push for scale will change,\u201d he started. \u201cTechnology and innovation will play a key role. We are likely to see smaller electric trucks using GPS and AI to move to the right areas of the pit, reducing payloads but potentially increasing speed.\n\n\u201cRail locos may be replaced by autonomous rail-cars and we can radically reshape the blending we do today and change the way the industry has thought about cut-off grades. This could potentially unlock billions of tonnes of previously uneconomic resources and lead to the mining of waste and tailings.\u201d\n\nAs we noted with Rio Tinto\u2019s announcement of a \u201ceureka\u201d moment that might see it mine lithium from the waste dumps created by 100 years of boron mining on California\u2019s Mojave Desert, this would be history repeating itself. To refresh, Rio Tinto\u2019s Australian history started with new technology that allowed the extraction of zinc from waste dumps in Broken Hill.\n\nFuture mining will also be a place more attuned to relentless expectations of shareholders, communities and governments. Miners must be seen as \u201cpart of the solution\u201d, but the sector\u2019s approach \u201cneeds to be based on a pragmatic kind of sustainability\u201d that retains \u201cprofitability at its heart\u201d.\n\n\u201cSociety expects more of our industry which in turn brings with it a sea change in shareholder expectations and more and more questions on our business model,\u201d Jacques said.\n\n\u201cIt is already starting to happen. There is absolutely no doubt we must play our part in reducing emissions for future generations. This requirement is already driving structural changes across our industry, limiting investment in commodities such as thermal coal, or investment in companies who mine coal.''", "description": "Big mining's next frontier is the digital world, and growing risk aversion means that shareholders should continue to earn an overweight share of the sector's wealth creation, says Jean-Sebastien Jacques", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1576%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_6/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dc29211cfa7ad7fa395210ca41f1f3a6f4e9f207", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
