But IBM said in a statement that the secretary's son \"has been a digital strategy consultant with IBM Services since February. His role is unrelated to IBM's pursuit of JEDI.\"\n\nFour companies \u2014 Oracle, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft \u2014 initially bid for the winner-take-all program, which will allow troops across the Department of Defense to seamlessly share everything from employment information to intelligence around the world through the cloud. Amazon and Microsoft remain in the running for the final contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion over 10 years if all options are exercised.\n\nBoth Oracle and IBM have raised issues with the Pentagon\u2019s procurement process for the program, saying that the contract should be split among multiple companies rather than awarded to a single winner. Oracle sued the Pentagon in December after it was cut from the competition, alleging that the Defense Department unfairly limited competition by tailoring the JEDI requirements to Amazon\u2019s proposed solution. A federal judge ruled in favor of the Pentagon, but Oracle announced in August that it would appeal the ruling.\n\nOracle separately filed a protest in August 2018 with the Government Accountability Office, which also concluded that the Pentagon\u2019s procurement process was fair.\n\nMorning Defense Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington\u2019s national security apparatus.
