And, when I see them play, it looks like everyone wants to be there to play for this club and be in this team.\n\n\u201cI watch them and it seems they are having fun \u00adplaying at such an \u00adextraordinarily high level \u2013 but they are also \u00addemanding of each other. That\u2019s why they won\u2019t ease up.\n\n(Image: Reuters / Phil Noble)\n\n\u201cI saw the episode with Mo Salah and Sadio Mane, but, far from thinking that was \u00addamaging to the dressing room spirit, I thought that showed how strong it is.\n\n\u201cIt just shows that everyone wants to win together and what a great group Klopp has built with that dynamic.\"\n\nThe 2005 Champions League winner added: \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have that kind of openness where players can call each other out. That\u2019s part of the culture of winning.\n\n\u201cAll successful teams have that desire, which means they \u00addemand more from each other.\n\n\u201cI remember some sparks \u00adflying between players when I was at Anfield \u2013 and that\u2019s only good for the team.\u201d", "description": "Former Reds defender fears Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson play too many minutes because they're so crucial to the team", "authors": ["Steve Bates", "Image", "Andrew Powell", "Reuters", "Phil Noble"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16241426.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tottenham-Hotspur-v-Liverpool-UEFA-Champions-League-Final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
