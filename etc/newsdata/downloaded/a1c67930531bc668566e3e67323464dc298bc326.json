Survey gives the top six picks", "language": "en", "text": "By Casey Baseel, SoraNews24\n\nTokyo is a very, very big city, not just in terms of population, but in physical size as well. Being spread out over such a large space means one part of town can feel very different from another, so if you\u2019re looking for a place to live in Tokyo, the first step is choosing which neighborhood you want to live in.\n\nTo make that choice a little easier, Japanese real estate portal Major7, which deals with condominium sales, conducted a survey asking people which part of Tokyo they most want to live in, and why. A total of 2,896 responses were collected, so let\u2019s take a look at the top six picks.\n\n6. Futako Tamagawa\n\nTop reasons to live there: Convenient shopping, good public transportation access, clean and fashionable atmosphere\n\nPhoto:\n\nA posh suburb southwest of downtown Tokyo, the riverside Futako Tamagawa neighborhood has seen a number of mixed commercial/residential centers go up in recent years. But despite being buffered from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo\u2019s urban center, it\u2019s still just 10 minutes by train, with no transfer needed, to Shibuya, making for an easy commute to work or easy excursions into the big city on the weekend.\n\n5. Kichijoji\n\nTop reasons to live there: Good public transportation access, convenient shopping, park space\n\nPhoto:\n\nKichijoji has a lot in common with Futako Tamagawa, although instead of the banks of the Tamagawa River, Kichijoji\u2019s most picturesque views are found in the neighborhood\u2019s Inokashira Park, one of the best places in Tokyo for cherry blossom viewing. Like Futako Tamagawa, Kichijoji has a large selection of shops and restaurants located in a network of covered pedestrian shopping streets, but not so many offices. The result is a stylish local vibe, but with access to downtown\u2019s Shinjuku Station, the busiest rail hub in Japan, in a quick 15-minute ride on the JR Chuo Line.\n\n4. Jiyugaoka\n\nTop reasons to live there: Attractive train lines, good public transportation access, convenient daily life\n\nYet another \u201cjust outside downtown suburb,\u201d Jiyugaoka is where the Toyoko and Oimachi train lines (which connect to Shibuya and Oimachi Stations) converge, and both have a reputation for slightly less congestion during rush hour and fewer drunks late at night than many other Tokyo lines. The neighborhood itself has a high concentration of cafes and boutiques, and it\u2019s also not far from number-six pick Futako Tamagawa.\n\n3. Meguro\n\nTop reasons to live there: Good public transportation access, short commutes, convenient daily life\n\nMeguro is located along the Yamanote loop line that circles downtown Tokyo. However, whereas a lot of Yamanote Line neighborhoods are heavily built up with high-rise office towers and expensive nightlife, Meguro is still a pocket of less intensive development, with enough supermarkets and other routine shopping facilities for a comfortable day-to-day life.\n\n2. Shinagawa\n\nTop reasons to live there: Good public transportation access, expected future development, short commutes\n\nShinagawa is sort of a beefed-up Meguro, in that it\u2019s a stop on the Yamanote Line that still has facilities that cater to local residents (including one of Tokyo\u2019s largest meat wholesale markets). The neighborhood isn\u2019t as congested as, say, Shibuya or Shinjuku, but it does have a ton of high-rise condos and offices, and more are likely to come with the addition of a brand-new Yamanote Line station adjacent to Shinagawa set to open in 2020, which should cause some new development to spill over into the Shinagawa area too. The Shinkansen bullet train stopping at Shinagawa Station is also a plus for those who take frequent business or pleasure trips.\n\n1. Ebisu\n\nTop reasons to live there: Good public transportation access, fashionable, elegant atmosphere\n\nOnce again, Ebisu is serviced by the Yamanote Line, plus the Hibiya subway line for those who want to cut subterraneously across the city center and also the Shonan Shinjuku Line, for those who want to hit up the beaches of the Shonan coastline on weekend day-trips. While Meguro and Shinagawa give residents a bit of the glitz of downtown, Ebisu feels one step closer to the bright lights of the big city, and about as close as you can get to them before the glare would start to be unpleasant to deal with every day. You get fancy shops, restaurants, and art venues, but with only a fraction of the hordes of commuters and tourist crowds you\u2019ll run into in many of Tokyo\u2019s other downtown districts.\n\nPlus, living in Ebisu means you\u2019re within walking distance to the Ebisu beer museum, a perk that\u2019s definitely hard to beat.\n\nSource: Major7 via IT Media\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Yokohama ranks as most desirable city for living in Kanto for the second year in a row\n\n-- Moving to Tokyo?
