Benjamin and Akinyi is arguably the couple on \u201c90 Day Fiance\u201d that courts the least drama. But a recent leak about their relationship hints that there might be more than what meets the eye between the two. It can be recalled that Benjamin and Akinyi faced a lot of challenges in the past few episodes. Not only did Benjamin struggle with the culture shock that being in Kenya gave him, but Akinyi\u2019s brother also did not make a particularly strong impression on viewers.\n\nDue to the country\u2019s conservative nature, the couple had to ask permission from the church elders for their union. This could become a big issue, later on, considering that Ben has children from a previous relationship. Benjamin also struggles with the fact that he has to come up with a huge amount of money to pay off the dowry.\n\nK1-Visa for Akinyi\n\nRecent rumors suggested that there is a possibility that Benjamin may get a K1-Visa for Akinyi, reports TV Shows Ace.\n\nIt seems that the former has already filled out an application for Akinyi, which means that there is a high likelihood that it will be approved.\n\nThe K1 Visa is a particular subclass of visas that are given to a fianc\u00e9 or fianc\u00e9e of an American citizen. Once the fianc\u00e9 or fianc\u00e9e enters American soil, the couple is required to marry within 90 days. A lot of the show\u2019s fans are actually unimpressed with Benjamin\u2019s gesture.

Before he met his current fianc\u00e9, he actually had a divorce from a marriage that produced his 5-year old son Grayson. While he has not named and rarely talked about his ex-wife, he did say that she was not willing to fix their marriage when it started going sour.\n\nAfter the lessons he learned from the last one, the American promised that he will be putting God at the center of his current relationship.
