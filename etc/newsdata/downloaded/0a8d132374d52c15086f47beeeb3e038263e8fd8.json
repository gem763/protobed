The trials will look to couple 5G and artificial intelligence together to create \"real-time coaching\" for workers.\n\n\"Machine operators will be monitored using cameras, with an AI-based system providing feedback on their performance based on an analysis of their movements,\" Nokia said.\n\nNokia has experienced strong growth as late, having reported a 7% year-over-year increase to its net sales for Q2 2019. It also reported that it had rolled out nine live 5G networks and signed 45 commercial 5G deals as of July.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nNokia and NTT DoCoMo to use 5G and AI to monitor workers\n\nIf your performance review isn't going as expected, look for a power cord to pull.\n\nSK Telecom and Ericsson complete end-to-end 5G standalone core test\n\nSK Telecom and Ericsson have completed testing of telecommunications using purely 5G handsets, radio stations, and cores.\n\nHow 5G moves by Poland and Vietnam could change everything and leave the US cornered\n\nThe choices being made by two countries not generally known for shaping the world's technology standards may result in the US falling into a strategic and technological trap of its own making.\n\nEricsson and Telstra make standalone 5G call\n\nFirst call in Australia made over actual 5G.\n\nNokia and Lenovo lead global survey on regularity of Android brand software and security updates (TechRepublic)\n\nAs more people keep their smartphones for longer, the survey found that most companies are failing to update older versions.", "description": "An extension of the 5G Future X Lab that was built at its Nokia Bell Labs headquarters in New Jersey last year.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/25/611ac3cb-d2c2-4b66-9a61-1750c52be05c/thumbnail/770x578/a7176a9efb3f045cb933cb2fda7ef0f9/190424-brooklyn-5g-summit-01-rajeev-suri-nokia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
