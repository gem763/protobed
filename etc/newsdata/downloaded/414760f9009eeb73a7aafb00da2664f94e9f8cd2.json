Judge Corley said she wasn\u2019t satisfied that the presence of Peng's family in California was enough to keep the defendant in the U.S.\n\nPeng came to the U.S. in 2001 on a temporary business visa and operated U.S. Tour and Travel in San Francisco. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.
