Nine were found guilty of sedition and given prison sentences of between nine and 13 years.\n\nThousands are now marching cross-country to Barcelona to join the general strike, as protesters set up blockades on highways and disrupt the commuter rail service by walking on the train tracks.\n\nAccording to the US's Overseas Security Advisory Council, which has been monitoring the situation, \"Demonstrations are also likely to disrupt roadways leading into Barcelona from various towns throughout the region, including marches on major highways from Tarragona, Tarrega, Berga, Vic and Girona. In addition to clashing with law enforcement, protesters in some areas have disrupted public transportation, damaged traffic lights, and obstructed rail lines and road access to the Barcelona airport\".\n\nThe strike was actually scheduled for earlier in the month, on October 11, and only later moved to the 18th to coincide with the Supreme Court's verdict.\n\nTrade unions Intersindical-CSC and Intersindical Alternativa de Catalyunia, who called the strike, say their aim is to demand the increase of the minimum wage and to denounce recent labour legislative reforms, perceived as harmful to workers.\n\n\"We want to denounce the rights that workers have seen fade away in the past few years and demand that they're given back\", spokeswoman Assumpta Barbens of IAC explained.\n\n\"The Strike is ours, the context is not\", insisted Carles Sastre, general secretary of Intersindical-CSC, underlining that labour rights are still central to this protest.", "description": "It is the fifth day of protests over the jailing of nine Catalan leaders.", "authors": ["Viola Stefanello"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/20/88/1000x563_cmsv2_1c54471a-54eb-50f7-845f-32c2dae4a07e-4242088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
