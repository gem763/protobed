Midsize businesses added 64,000 jobs and small businesses, or those with 49 employees or fewer, added 17,000 jobs.\n\nOf the 138,000 jobs the service-producing sector added, the growth was across all industries. The trade, transportation and utilities and education and health sectors both brought in the most new jobs, and added 32,000 and 41,000, respectively.\n\nWithin the goods-producing sector, the construction industry lost 4,000 jobs and the natural resources and mining jobs also fell by 4,000. Manufacturing lost 4,000 additional jobs.\n\nThe ADP Research Institute puts out the monthly report with Moody's Analytics.\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
