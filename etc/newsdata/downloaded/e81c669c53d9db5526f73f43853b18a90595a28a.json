Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) October 27, 2019\n\nThe stunning development comes just four days after the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into allegations that Hill, 32, had violated House rules by engaging in a sexual relationship with a staffer in her office.\n\nHill, who identifies as bisexual, had forcefully denied that allegation, though she admitted she had engaged in a relationship with a campaign staffer before she was elected to Congress. Hill last week apologized to her constituents for that dalliance, calling it \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHouse rules bar sexual relationships with office staff, but the prohibition does not extend to campaign aides.\n\nThe allegations of Hill\u2019s relationships first emerged in an Oct. 18 report on RedState, a conservative news site, and the Daily Mail followed with a similar story a few days later. Several nude photos of Hill were leaked to the publications, triggering the ethics complaint. Hill and her attorneys have said she is going through a messy divorce and that she is the victim of revenge porn by \u201can abusive husband.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, new reports emerged that Hill had paid a campaign aide she had been romantically involved with a $5,100 bonus.\n\nPolitico first reported news of Hill\u2019s resignation.\n\nIn her lengthy statement, Hill suggested she was resigning to stop some of her supporters from being dragged through the mud.\n\n\u201cThis is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband, and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation,\u201d Hill said.\n\n\u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. It's also illegal. And we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options,\u201d she added.\n\nThe news, which shocked Washington, brings an abrupt end to the congressional career of a young Democrat who was already on a leadership trajectory and making a name for herself in the diverse caucus.\n\nHill flipped a Republican seat in last year\u2019s midterms, defeating then-Rep.
