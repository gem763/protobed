Baker Hughes also agreed to buy $250 million of Class B stock from GE and/or its affiliates.\n\nGE's reduced stake means it will have the right to designate only one board member, compared with five now. John G. Rice will be its designee. Meanwhile, Jamie S. Miller and James J. Mulva will submit their resignations to the board's conflicts committee, while Lorenzo Simonelli and W. Geoffrey Beattie are expected to stay on the board but not as GE designees.\n\nWrite to Josh Beckerman at josh.beckerman@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 10, 2019 16:49 ET (20:49 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
