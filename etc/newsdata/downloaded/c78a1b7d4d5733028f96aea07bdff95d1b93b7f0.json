Loblaw initially collected that information, but stopped partway through. The privacy commissioner is not asking the company to do anything further to address the issue. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: The grocer voluntarily offered the gift cards after it received immunity for cooperating in a Competition Bureau investigation of alleged collusion to raise bread prices. The antitrust agency has been criticized for its decisions on Loblaw and for the size of its fine of Volkswagen in the diesel-emissions case; in a recent interview with The Logic, competition commissioner Matthew Boswell noted it was not involved with the gift card program and is constrained by the legal limits on the monetary penalties it can issue. The privacy commissioner\u2019s fining powers are similarly limited, though in May, the government proposed to expand them in a discussion paper on reforms to Canada\u2019s consumer privacy law. But Loblaw isn\u2019t entirely done with the issue\u2014it still faces a $1-billion class-action lawsuit over the alleged bread price-fixing.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz", "Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
