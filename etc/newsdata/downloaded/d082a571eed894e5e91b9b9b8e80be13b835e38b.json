But Sir Oliver helped MPs take control of the Commons earlier this year to pass the Benn Act which makes a No Deal much more difficult\n\nHe has been one of the leading Brexit rebels among Remain-backing MPs as they have tried and succeeded in their efforts to rule out a No Deal Brexit.\n\nHis name was at the top of a motion passed at the start of September which enabled MPs to take control of the Commons and subsequently pass the Benn Act - the anti-No Deal law that will force the PM to ask the EU for a delay if no agreement has been backed by close of play this evening.\n\nSir Oliver was loyal to Theresa May's original Brexit deal as he backed it on all three occasions when it was put to a vote.\n\nBut the prospect of a No Deal Brexit prompted him to play a central role in bringing forward the indicative votes process earlier this year when MPs tried and failed to agree a Brexit option that a majority in the Commons could back.\n\nHis rebellion over opposition to No Deal came to a head last month when he was one of 21 MPs stripped of the Tory whip after supporting the bid to block a disorderly split from the EU.\n\nHe is in many respects an unlikely rebel.\n\nEducated at Eton and then Cambridge, the 63-year-old first entered politics as a member of Margaret Thatcher's policy unit in Number 10 in the 1980s.\n\nHe was then first elected as the Tory MP for West Dorset in 1997 before making a rapid rise up the Conservative ranks, joining the opposition frontbench and eventually becoming shadow chancellor in 2003.\n\nHe became a key figure in David Cameron's administration, acting as the PM's 'fixer', after he helped to draw up the Tories' 2010 election manifesto.\n\nAfter being a constant in Mr Cameron's governments, Sir Oliver was then ousted from the frontbench by Theresa May when she became PM in 2016.\n\nHe is regarded as a 'big brain' in Whitehall circles and is viewed as a man who has a gift for creative thinking and problem solving.\n\nSir Oliver was first elected as the Tory MP for West Dorset in 1997 having previously worked in Margaret Thatcher's Number 10 policy unit. The former PM is pictured alongside Sir Oliver on the campaign trail\n\nSir Oliver, pictured at the far end of the Cabinet table on the left hand side, was a key figure in David Cameron's administration, acting as the PM's 'fixer'\n\nBut he has over the years developed a reputation as a hapless politician who has been prone to gaffes and finding himself in embarrassing situations.\n\nHe once unwittingly welcomed two burglars into his London home after they said they wanted to use the bathroom.\n\nHe was also once spotted discarding parliamentary papers into a bin in St James's Park.\n\nBefore the 2001 general election he and his local challengers dressed up in togas for a debate, prompting ridicule.\n\nIn 2015 he apologised after it emerged he had blamed 'bad moral attitudes' in black inner-city communities for riots in the 1980s in a paper he had helped write.\n\nOutside of politics, Sir Oliver is married and has two children. He is expected to stand down as an MP at the next election.", "description": "Sir Oliver Letwin has been a repeated thorn in the side of the government over Brexit.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/10/19917172-0-image-a-10_1571478051662.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
