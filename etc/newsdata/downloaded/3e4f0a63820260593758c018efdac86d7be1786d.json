It can affect the baby\u2019s brain. You shouldn\u2019t be this stressed out when you\u2019re pregnant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And Coleen Rooney is a mother, she should know that this is not acceptable. Come out now and say, \u201cUntil Rebekah is proven guilty, let\u2019s leave this now, this is not okay.\u201d\n\n\u2018This could have waited. It\u2019s being on for how many years, let it wait, be respectful.\u2019\n\nNicola also claimed that Coleen, 33, was aware of the can of worms she would be opening when calling Rebekah out on Instagram, and should have gone about things in a different way.\n\nNicola McLean hit out at Coleen Rooney (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018She could\u2019ve stopped it, she didn\u2019t need to do this,\u2019 she fumed. \u2018I don\u2019t know Coleen and I\u2019m not saying Coleen\u2019s a bad person, I don\u2019t know her.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m saying, as a mother and as someone that\u2019s been in this industry for a long time, you are aware, with her level of following, this is what\u2019s going to happen. She knew that and she chose to put a pregnant woman under this much stress.\u2019\n\nSpeaking about the vile trolling her pal has been subjected to, she added: \u2018We\u2019ve had two reality TV stars die. We\u2019ve got a pregnant woman that should not be subjected to this level of abuse.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s horrific. [She\u2019s been told] \u201cHope the unborn baby dies, hope they both die\u201d. This level of abuse is horrific especially if you\u2019re pregnant.\n\nColeen Rooney lashed out at Rebekah Vardy on Instagram (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018We all have to have compassion. We\u2019ve got someone who is seven months pregnant who is receiving death threats and saying they wish her unborn baby dies.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drama all kicked off when Coleen shared a statement on Wednesday reading: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\nRebekah has denied all the claims (Picture: Rex)\n\n\u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRebekah \u2013 who is currently pregnant with her fifth child \u2013 hit back shortly after, denying all the claims and insisting she would be looking into who else had access to her Instagram page.\n\nShe also compared arguing with the mum-of-four to \u2018rowing with a pigeon\u2019, stating she \u2018completely annihilated\u2019 her.\n\nThis Morning continues on weekdays, at 10.30am, on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
