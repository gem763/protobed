Hugh Hewitt and Duane Patterson dug up video of Biden last year bragging about how he got the prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s employer fired. Biden made sure to include in this tale how important his threat to withhold US aid badly needed by Petro Poroshenko at the time was to his success.\n\nThe video starts off this segment of Hugh\u2019s interview with Lindsey Graham, who quips that the media coverage of Ukraine-Gate is making the Kavanaugh smear last week \u201clook like good journalism\u201d:\n\nHH: Here is Joe Biden in 2018 talking about the Ukraine. Cut number 25: JB: Well, I was, not I, but it just happened to be that was the assignment I got. I got all the good ones. And so I got Ukraine. And I remember going over convincing our team, our, others to convincing that we should be providing for loan guarantees. And I went over, try to guess the 12th, 13th time to Kiev, and I was going to, supposed to announce that there was another billion dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor, and they didn\u2019t. So they said they had, they were walking out to a press conference, and I said no, I said I\u2019m not going to, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. The president said. I said call him. I said I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said you\u2019re not getting the billion, and I\u2019m going to be leaving here, and I think it was what, six hours. I looked. I said I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. HH: Joined now by United States Senator Lindsey Graham. Good morning, Senator, always a pleasure to have you. LG: Well, that\u2019s a good lead-in to me, the old, good old son of a bitch lead-in. How are you doing? HH: (laughing) I\u2019m good. LG: (laughing) HH: I\u2019m good. I\u2019m not going to call you\u2026have you heard that Joe Biden quote before? LG: No, never ever. HH: What does that tell you about this weekend\u2019s rush to judgment? It\u2019s another example of verdict first, trial later when it comes to Donald Trump. And I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s heard the Joe Biden quote saying he got the prosecutor fired. LG: Well, it makes the Kavanaugh story look like good journalism.\n\nNote well that Biden leaves out the context of what the prosecutor was investigating at the time of Biden\u2019s insistence on getting him fired. He was quarterbacking a corruption probe targeting Burisma, which was paying Hunter Biden a fortune ($50,000 a month at the time). In fact, it seems a little weird without that context as to why foreign aid to Ukraine depended on the person filling a state prosecutor\u2019s office at all. What foreign-policy interest would the identity of a state prosecutor \u2014 an internal affair \u2014 have involved that would derail a billion-dollar aid package to an ally in desperate need of the cash?\n\nAnd yet, here was Biden bragging last year that \u201cson of a bitch, he got fired\u201d \u2014 after Biden explicitly used the authority of his office and the president\u2019s to get rid of the man looking into his son\u2019s employer. Even if one assumes Donald Trump attempted to pressure Volodymyr Zelenskiy into reopening the Burisma probe, it can\u2019t be any worse that the explicit quid pro quo demanded by Biden \u2026 in his own words.\n\nBut did Biden actually interfere in the prosecution? That\u2019s a question worth asking, but the New York Times seemed to think it was a possibility in May. Biden\u2019s pressure to fire Viktor Shokin got Yuri Litsenko appointed in his place. Litsenko ended up closing the Burisma probe, but he tried to reopen it this year, although that might have had political implications as well:\n\nWhen Mr. Shokin became prosecutor general in February 2015, he inherited several investigations into the company and Mr. Zlochevsky, including for suspicion of tax evasion and money laundering. Mr. Shokin also opened an investigation into the granting of lucrative gas licenses to companies owned by Mr. Zlochevsky when he was the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. Mr. Zlochevsky and Burisma have always vigorously disputed the accusations against them. \u2026 The decision to reopen the investigation into Burisma was made in March by the current Ukrainian prosecutor general, who had cleared Hunter Biden\u2019s employer more than two years ago. The announcement came in the midst of Ukraine\u2019s contentious presidential election, and was seen in some quarters as an effort by the prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, to curry favor from the Trump administration for his boss and ally, the incumbent president, Petro O. Poroshenko. Mr. Poroshenko lost his re-election bid in a landslide last month. While the incoming president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said he will replace Mr. Lutsenko as prosecutor general, Mr. Zelensky has not said whether the prosecutors he appoints will be asked to continue the investigation.\n\nAnd while the Obama administration was initially supportive of the probe into Burisma, that was apparently before Burisma started paying Hunter Biden $50K a month:\n\nConcerns about Mr. Shokin notwithstanding, the cases against Burisma had high-level support from the Obama administration. In April 2014, it sent top officials to a forum on Ukrainian asset recovery, co-sponsored by the United States government, in London, where Mr. Zlochevsky\u2019s case was highlighted. Early that year, Mr. Archer, the Kerry family friend, and Hunter Biden were part of a wave of Americans who would come from across the Atlantic to help Burisma both with its substantive legal issues and its image. Their support allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans at a time when Ukraine was especially dependent on aid and strategic backing from the United States and its allies, according to people who worked in Ukraine at the time.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this catch from David Martosko:\n\nHere's a problem: Joe Biden *did* discuss overseas business with his son Hunter, at least once. This is from The New Yorker, about 2 months ago. https://t.co/QzfeWoopn7 pic.twitter.com/jOZmV9sQPf \u2014 David Martosko (@dmartosko) September 21, 2019\n\nSo at the very least, Biden was clearly aware of the conflict of interest manifest in his intervention. Read the rest at the NYT\u2019s meticulously detailed tick-tock on the Ukraine-Burisma mess. Whatever the intent, the outcome was that Burisma got let off the hook, whether thanks to the change of prosecutor or not, and the Obama administration didn\u2019t demand another firing of Lustenko as a result. His son benefited from Biden\u2019s intervention whether it was Biden\u2019s intent or not. There is as much smoke around that question as there presently is around Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy, and as much question of abuse of authority. Both men have to provide some answers to these questions, at least if we\u2019re to insist that personal interests cross the line in diplomatic efforts, which is actually a very good standard to impose.\n\nPolitico skips over this part of Hugh\u2019s interview with Graham to report that the senator \u201curges Trump\u201d to be transparent. Actually, Graham mainly predicted Trump would surprise everyone with a release of the transcript:\n\n\u201cI would urge him to continue to be as transparent as possible and tell us as much as he can without compromising executive privilege, so that we can understand what happened,\u201d the South Carolina Republican told conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt during an interview on his show. \u2026 \u201cI believe that President Trump is going to blow you away with his willingness to disclose and be transparent about this phone call, because I think he did nothing wrong and he has nothing to hide,\u201d Graham said. \u201cGet ready for some disclosures from the president that I think will exceed every expectation,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you this will happen, but I think the president will clear the air when it comes to the whistleblower allegation.\u201d\n\nThere isn\u2019t a word about the Biden video in the Politico report, but it\u2019s not going to stay quiet for long. At some point, Democrats will have to either drop the matter or drop Biden.", "description": "\"It makes the Kavanaugh story look like good journalism.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/biden-cfr.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
