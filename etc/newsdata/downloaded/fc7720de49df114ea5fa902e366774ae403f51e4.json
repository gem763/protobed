The pound has gained around 0.8% this week, but with plenty of ups and downs, while the FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.10% has fallen 1%. The index opened with mild losses at 7,162.83.\n\n\u201cWe have been involved in ongoing discussions with the government. As things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT,\u201d said DUP leader Arlene Foster and MP Nigel Dodds in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try to get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom,\u201d the politicians said.\n\nThe pound spiked briefly Wednesday on a report, later dismissed, that the DUP would accept the so-called consent element of the revised Brexit agreement, seen as the last big obstacle to a deal. The U.K. has said it is open to some flexibility on the mechanism that would allow those politicians to decide whether it remains in regulatory alignment with the EU as set out in the latest Brexit deal proposals.\n\nThe development comes as a two-day European Union summit gets under way. The U.K. and the EU had hoped to have a withdrawal deal ready for that meeting.", "description": "The pound is down again as a Brexit deal looks like it is on the rocks once again.", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GR873_Britis_ZG_20181016143010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
