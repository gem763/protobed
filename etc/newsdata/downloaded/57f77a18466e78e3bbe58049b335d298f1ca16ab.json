Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2014 could successfully take down President Trump in the 2020 general election.\n\n\u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?\u2019\u201d Leah Daughtry, who the Times described as a \u201clongtime Democrat who has run two of the party\u2019s recent conventions,\u201d said.\n\nThat is just one example of many. According to the Times, many Democrats \u2014 from voters to high-profile lawmakers \u2014 are worried about the state of the current Democrat field and are quietly looking for a savior:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more anxiety than ever,\u201d said Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Democrat who some in the party would like to see join the race. \u201cWe\u2019re both getting the calls. I\u2019ve been surprised by some who\u2019ve called me.\u201d \u201cI can see it, I can feel it, I can hear it,\u201d Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, said of the unease within the party. He said he thinks Mr. Biden is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump but called the former vice president\u2019s fund-raising \u201ca real concern.\u201d\n\nClinton and billionaire Michael Bloomberg are reportedly keeping tabs on the mounting concerns and \u201chave both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary,\u201d according to the Times. However, they are \u201cskeptical there would be an opening, according to Democrats who have spoken with them.\u201d\n\nThe Times adds that Democrats familiar with their thinking do not see either jumping in unless Biden goes down:\n\nThe chances that another major contender decides to run are remote: While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both been encouraged to enter the race, Democrats close to them believe the only scenario under which they\u2019d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.\n\nThe Washington Post also signaled that a 2020 run for Clinton remains on the table, as Democrats continue to worry about Biden\u2019s mounting baggage and the ultra-liberal policies of his closest contenders.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction,\u201d the Post reported:\n\nThose close to Clinton, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on her behalf, say she has felt vindicated over the past few weeks as Trump\u2019s political difficulties have deepened. That sentiment was reinforced this week when the State Department announced its probe into emails sent to a private server, a major complication of her 2016 campaign, found no evidence of deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees.\n\nOne source who spoke with Clinton said that it is \u201cunlikely\u201d that she would throw her hat into the presidential ring for the third time but emphasized that the chances \u201cain\u2019t zero.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut put it this way: It ain\u2019t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,\u201d the source said, according to the Post.\n\nClinton has made no obvious attempts to extinguish the festering 2020 buzz. This month, Trump teased \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d suggesting that she enter the race \u201cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\u201d Clinton warned Trump not to \u201ctempt\u201d her to do so on social media.\n\nI think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u201cC\u201d Subpoena! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nShe furthered speculation during an interview with PBS NewsHour, claiming that she could \u201cobviously\u201d beat Trump \u201cagain,\u201d although her use of \u201cagain\u201d remains unclear, as Trump defeated Clinton by surpassing the required 270 Electoral College threshold.\n\n\u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d\n\nThe former secretary of state continued to fuel the rumblings by posting a quote from Beyonc\u00e9 about the need to \u201ctake\u201d power on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 speaks the truth,\u201d Clinton wrote in the caption:", "description": "Rumors of Hillary Clinton's consideration of a 2020 bid intensified this week following reports from the New York Times and Washington Post.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Hillary-Clinton-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
