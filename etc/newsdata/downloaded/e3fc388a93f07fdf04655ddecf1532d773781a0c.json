REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/Files\n\nThe greenback fell overnight after data showed hiring by U.S. private employers had cooled in September, the latest indicator that the Sino-U.S. trade dispute is hurting the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nIt remained wobbly in Asian hours, while stocks tumbled as investors grappled with the deepening global economic gloom.\n\n\u201cMarkets are beginning to look at the U.S. economy with a bit more concern,\u201d said Han Tan, a Kuala Lumpur-based market analyst at brokerage FXTM.\n\n\u201cThe fear now is that the manufacturing slowdown in the global economy is feeding back into the U.S. as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBigger alarm bells would sound off if we started to see a bigger slowdown from U.S. consumers,\u201d Tan added, noting investors\u2019 attention would now turn to Friday\u2019s U.S. jobs data for a fuller picture of the economy\u2019s health.\n\nThe dollar crossed 107 Japanese yen and touched a week low of 106.95 yen. It fell to $1.0964 per euro, though both moves were less than a tenth of a percentage point.\n\nIt held close to a one-week low against the New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 at $0.6265 per kiwi and weakened a little against the beaten-up Australian dollar AUD=D3 to $0.6715.\n\nAdding to concerns, the United States won approval on Wednesday to levy tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods over illegal subsidies handed to Airbus, threatening to trigger a transatlantic trade war.\n\nFutures pricing indicated a 73% chance that the U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce benchmark interest rates to support the economy at its next meeting later this month. FEDWATCH\n\nThat is up from about 60% a day earlier, but was not enough to drive a spirited flight from the dollar, which is also widely seen as a safety bet at times of economic or political uncertainty. The greenback held steady against a basket of currencies .DXY, just above 99 and not miles below the two year high 99.667 it hit on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s been a bit of a seachange in market sentiment,\u201d said Nick Twidale co-founder of Sydney-based trade finance provider Xchainge, though adding that the U.S. still looked in better shape the Europe.\n\n\u201cI think overall (the dollar) will remain grinding higher while there\u2019s still a disparity between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nThe next readings on global economic health will be European August retail sales and a German service sector survey due on Thursday, and September\u2019s U.S. non-manufacturing ISM survey due at 1400 GMT.\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 was steady at $1.2304 after fluctuating in a tight range as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson proposed an all-island regulatory zone in Ireland in his final pitch for a Brexit deal before the end of the month.\n\nSterling\u2019s outlook, however, remained uncertain after a cool response to the proposal from Brussels, leaving a no-deal exit from the European Union on Oct. 31 a real possibility.\n\nIn offshore trade, the Chinese yuan CNH= ticked up slightly to 7.1368 per dollar, with trade subdued as Chinese markets are closed until Monday for public holidays.", "description": "The dollar eased on Thursday, sliding to fresh one-week lows against the euro and yen as investor anxiety deepened over fresh signs of slowing U.S. economic growth and a broadening of global trade frictions.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436567216&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920JT"}
