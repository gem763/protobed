Have a question? Email her at dear.therapist@theatlantic.com.\n\nDear Therapist,\n\nHow do I tell my friends I really don't want to hear about the problems they are having in their relationships? It is really hard for me to listen to them complain about their spouses or significant others when I am fighting hard to accept being single.\n\nThey assume that because things are going well in other aspects of my life, I am okay with my nonexistent romantic life, and therefore free to listen to them complain. I am not. It's the reason I have been in and out of therapy for the past few years\u2014the inability to accept and deal with the fact that I am single, with no real prospects on the horizon.\n\nI want to be a good friend, but I just don't think I can hear another story about how he forgot to take out the trash or call right back so the marriage/relationship is over! When I tell them that I don't want to hear it, I truly mean it, but they assume I'm only kidding and keep talking. I have to take breaks from them just to get away before I explode and ruin friendships.\n\nPlease tell me what I should do.\n\nAnonymous\n\nDear Anonymous,\n\nWhat your friends might not realize is that many single people who long for a partner experience something called ambiguous loss or ambiguous grief. It\u2019s a type of grieving, but it\u2019s different from the grieving someone might do after a concrete loss like the death of a spouse from, say, cancer.", "description": "Listening to my friends talk about their relationship problems is getting really tough.", "authors": ["Lori Gottlieb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/single_final_high_res/facebook.jpg?1559528754", "published_at": "2019-06-03"}
