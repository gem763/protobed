Chief among the fears are that Huawei and ZTE are subject to Chinese laws, and could be told to secretly comply with demands from Chinese intelligence services, which could put Americans\u2019 data at risk of surveillance or espionage.\n\nThe claims first arose in 2012 following a House inquiry, which labeled the company a national security threat.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration banned federal agencies from buying equipment from Huawei and ZTE, as well as Hytera and Hikvision.\n\nBoth Huawei and ZTE have long denied the allegations.\n\nChairman Pai said in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal: \u201cWhen it comes to 5G and America\u2019s security, we can\u2019t afford to take a risk and hope for the best. We need to make sure our networks won\u2019t harm our national security, threaten our economic security or undermine our values.\u201d\n\nDemocratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement: \u201cThe FCC is moving forward after more than a year and a half with its proposal to ensure that our universal service fund, which supports deployment in rural areas, will not be used to purchase insecure network equipment. But we need cybersecurity policies that target all our network providers\u2014not just our universal service recipients.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, we need to be mindful that in a global economy, our networks will still connect to insecure equipment abroad. So we should start researching how we can build networks that can withstand connection to equipment vulnerabilities around the world, including virtualizing the radio access part of our networks,\u201d said Rosenworcel.\n\nThe FCC\u2019s proposals are expected to be voted on during a meeting on November 19.", "description": "The Federal Communications Commission said it will move ahead with proposals to ban telecommunications giants from using Huawei and ZTE networking equipment, which the agency says poses a \u201cnational security threat.\u201d The two-part proposal revealed Monday would first bar telecoms giants from using funds it receives from the FCC\u2019s Universal Service Fund, used by the [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-460305974.jpg?w=579", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
