Motorized vehicles have been banned there since 1898, after carriage drivers complained the sound of \u201chorseless carriages\u201d would scare their horses.\n\nThere are some exceptions: Emergency vehicles are always allowed, and construction vehicles can motor on the island with a permit. Motorized wheelchairs are permitted in accordance with the American Disabilities Act.\n\nBut electric bikes and scooters? Banned. (Some city-dwellers might say that is reason enough to visit.)\n\nClearly some kind of exception was made for Pence\u2019s visit. But that wasn\u2019t the case in July 1975, when President Gerald R. Ford stayed for a working vacation.\n\n\n\nIn this contact sheet image, a Secret Service agent rides on the back of a horse-drawn carriage during President Ford's visit to Mackinac Island in July 1975.\n\nLike residents, Ford traveled by carriage to the Grand Hotel. He also made stops at a golf course and tennis club and, with first lady Betty Ford, went to Sunday church services.\n\nSome Secret Service agents followed alongside on foot, while others sat on benches on the backs of the larger carriages in the presidential horse-cade.\n\nNone of this would have come as a surprise to Ford. A native Michigander, he spent time on Mackinac Island in his teen years as a Boy Scout.\n\n\n\nA young Gerald Ford, far left, holds an American flag during a flag exercise, circa 1929. \"Jerry\" was in an Eagle Scout honor guard that led tours of Fort Mackinac. (Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library/Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library)\n\nKen Hafeli, a longtime archivist at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, wrote in a blog post that Ford\u2019s use of carriages during the 1975 visit \u201creally illustrate[s] the lack of pretension exhibited by President Ford and the Ford family during their time in the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even the Secret Service could get the people of Mackinac Island to back down on their ban on motorized vehicles,\u201d Hafeli wrote.\n\nThat may not have been the case entirely, though. Dennis Cawthorne, a longtime resident of Mackinac Island, told the Detroit Free Press that when Ford visited, the Secret Service insisted on having at least one vehicle at the ready, in case of an emergency.\n\n\u201cIt came over at night, and was moved very, very quickly in the dead of night to a state park garage,\u201d Cawthorne told the Free Press.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nTrump is considering presidential pardons.
