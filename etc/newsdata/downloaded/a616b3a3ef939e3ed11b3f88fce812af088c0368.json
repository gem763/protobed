Crosthwaite, who previously served as chief growth officer for major tobacco company Altria, which owns a 35% stake in Juul, according to The New York Times.\n\nJuul Labs also said Wednesday that it is suspending all broadcast, print and digital product advertising of its products in the United States, and that it will not fight the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to ban all flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nThe CEO of popular e-cigarette company Juul Labs is stepping down, with a former tobacco executive set to take his place.

As of last week, there have been at least 530 illnesses and seven deaths linked to e-cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nJuul Labs said Wednesday that it will not fight the Trump administration's proposal to ban flavored e-cigarettes.

Altria is the parent company of Philip Morris USA.\n\nPhilip Morris said it will instead focus on launching its own cigarette alternative in the United States, called IQOS, which the FDA has reviewed and authorized.\n\nCrosthwaite was instrumental in the commercial and regulatory efforts of IQOS\u2019s launch in the U.S., Juul Labs said.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nWalmart To End E-Cigarette Sales, Citing Growing Nationwide 'Uncertainty'\n\nFederal Prosecutors Launch Criminal Probe Into Juul Labs: Report\n\nMassachusetts Slaps Temporary Ban On All Vaping Sales Amid Growing Death Toll\n\nLove HuffPost?
