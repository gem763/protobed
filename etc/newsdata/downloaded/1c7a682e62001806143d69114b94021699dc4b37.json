For instance, \u201cThe Purloined Letter,\u201d from 1844, takes the reader by surprise: The incriminating letter, thought to be expertly hidden, hasn\u2019t been hidden at all\u2014it\u2019s been hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe Simplicity of a Mystery\n\nThat is, while the police had been looking high and low for the incriminating letter \u2014peeking into walls, pulling up floorboards\u2014they hadn\u2019t thought simply to look on the suspect\u2019s desk. At the end of the story, the ace private eye explains that the suspect \u201chad deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.\u201d\n\nOne reason the Poe story endures is that we\u2019ve all had moments like that: when we didn\u2019t notice something that was obvious\u2014precisely because it was obvious.\n\nVirgil always felt that way about the Clinton Global Initiative: It was an obvious conspiracy staring us in the face. Surely we can all remember that giant international influence-peddling system that has mostly faded away, now that Bill and Hillary don\u2019t have much influence to peddle. Yet for years, plutocrats and miscreants would pay millions to cadge some of the Clintons\u2019 celebrity\u2014and hope, too, of course, that President Hillary Clinton would deliver for them in the future.\n\nIt was all happening right before our eyes, on a swanky stage in Manhattan, and yet most reporters and chatterers thought that what the Clintons were doing was great. (And yes, no doubt, plenty was happening offstage, and that was not so great; too bad so few were interested.)\n\nHunter in Plain Sight\n\nToday, Virgil feels similarly about the case of Hunter Biden, son of presidential candidate Joe Biden; it\u2019s been beneath the nose of the whole world. And yet, of course, that\u2019s the one place where the Main Stream Media hasn\u2019t wished to look, or at least not looked long enough to reach some obvious conclusions.\n\nInstead, the MSM has been in an uproar over the way that President Trump and Rudy Giuliani have been pressing their argument against the Bidens. Indeed, every day\u2014probably more like every hour\u2014Trump & Giuliani are accused of some new bad thing. And yet in the meantime, Hunter Biden\u2019s profitable relationships with Ukrainian and Chinese businesses are mostly treated like old news, non-news, or barely news at all.\n\nWhy was Hunter a \u201csuccess\u201d in international business? It\u2019s never required the brain of a great detective to figure that one out.\n\nInterestingly, the basic outlines of Hunter\u2019s international dealings have been out there for many years\u2014beneath the nose of the whole world, as Poe might say\u2014because at least some reporters were nevertheless curious.\n\nIn 2012 Fox Business News\u2019 Charles Gasparino was writing unflatteringly about Hunter\u2019s many business dealings. And in 2014, The Daily Beast\u2019s Lloyd Green zeroed in on the younger Biden\u2019s doings with the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma.\n\nThen, in 2018, an investigative digger by the name of Peter Schweizer published a long story in The New York Post, further detailing Hunter\u2019s many dealings with China. (We\u2019ll come back to Schweizer in a moment.)\n\nStill, the Hunter story wasn\u2019t important during the Obama presidency, perhaps because reporters and their editors didn\u2019t want to do anything to besmirch the Obama-Biden administration. And maybe, too, it was because in those years, it was common enough that well-connected folks did international deals of that kind.\n\nSo okay, the younger Biden was up to his armpits in international business, but so were a lot of politically connected people, including Mitt Romney, John Kerry, and Jeb Bush. And then, when Trump came into office, well, who had time to worry about anything other than going after \u2026 him?\n\nSo that\u2019s why the Biden information just sat there, even after it was converted into Google-able news stories. Hunter, a man with no obvious skills and a distinctly checkered history, was suddenly doing very well in international business, specifically, in Ukraine and China. The facts were right beneath our nose, hiding in plain sight, and yet the agenda-setting news outlets\u2014the ones with the power to connect the dots of isolated stories\u2014never saw fit to connect them into a Biden narrative. It\u2019s the existence, or not, of a narrative that determines whether a given story ever gains airspeed.\n\nIndeed, the Hunter story didn\u2019t take off until last month, in the days after September 18, when The Washington Post first printed the allegations of the so-called whistleblower who accused the American president of muscling Ukraine\u2019s president to dish dirt on the Biden family.\n\nSoon thereafter, Hunter was in the news, big time; no wonder Giuliani took to calling himself \u201cthe real whistleblower\u201d\u2014blowing the whistle, that is, on the Bidens.\n\nYet now that the Hunter story has taken off, there\u2019s pushback from the MSM. It\u2019s no longer possible for journos to ignore the facts about Hunter, but it might be possible to put these facts in some sort of anti-Trump context.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s a blaring October 2 headline atop Bloomberg News: \u201cTrump\u2019s Impeachment Saga Stems From a Political Hit Job Gone Bad.\u201d So from that headline, we\u2019re supposed to summon up mental images of hired killers and the bad people who hire them \u2014 you know, baddies such as Trump.\n\nSo let Bloomberg reporter Joshua Green lay out his argument:\n\nThe irony of President Trump\u2019s sudden impeachment peril is that it\u2019s the unintended result of an effort to help him: a political hit job aimed at a likely opponent (Joe Biden) and funded by a major right-wing donor (Rebekah Mercer) that Trump and his lawyer (Rudy Giuliani) impatiently hijacked, with consequences that could turn out to be disastrous for them.\n\nOkay, so maybe we need to unpack that a bit. The assertion about the \u201cmajor right-wing donor,\u201d Rebekah Mercer, refers to Mercer\u2019s role as chairwoman of the Government Accountability Institute (GAI). The president of GAI is Peter Schweizer, the investigative digger whom we met earlier. Schweizer, in fact, is the author of eight books of history and muckraking, the best known of which is probably Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich; published in 2015, it had a substantial impact on the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn 2018, Schweizer published the book that\u2019s at issue in the Biden case, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends. As the title suggests, Schweizer\u2019s critique is far-reaching, ranging from the family of Joe Biden to the family of John Kerry and Theresa Heinz, whose offspring went into business with Hunter. Also mentioned, and not so nicely, in Schweizer\u2019s book was Sen. Mitch McConnell, as well as various well-paid hangers-on with the Obama administration. As the title emphasizes, Schweizer\u2019s target was the bipartisan \u201cpolitical class,\u201d as in, you know, swamp dwellers. There are many of them lurking around, in both parties.\n\nNowadays, if one wants to attack Schweizer, one can do so. However, in the process, it\u2019s hard not to get into the substance of Schweizer\u2019s book, including the seamy details about the Bidens. Let\u2019s consider the concession made by Bloomberg\u2019s Green:\n\nNor was it difficult for GAI to turn up examples of ethically questionable behavior by Biden\u2019s family members and publish the information in Secret Empires. . . . To all appearances, Hunter Biden was cashing in on the family name in a way that\u2019s common among political families in both parties.\n\nWe can pause right here and emphasize that these are the words of Green, not Schweizer: ethically questionable behavior by Biden\u2019s family members . . . cashing in on the family name.\n\nIn other words, we can see that for Schweizer and GAI, the feeling must be at least a little bit of mission accomplished: Even some of the MSM concedes that Hunter is a swamp thing. So the situation today doesn\u2019t at all justify that blazing Bloomberg headline, \u201cPolitical Hit Job Gone Bad.\u201d It would be better, and more accurate, to use the header, \u201cDiggers Raise Questions that Reporters, Too, Should be Asking.\u201d\n\nMoreover, as Green observes, Schweizer is actually rather modest in his claims about Hunter and Joe. That might change, to be sure, if Schweizer had subpoena power, but he doesn\u2019t. So all he can do is assemble the facts as he can uncover them:\n\nAs with Clinton Cash, Schweizer didn\u2019t allege in his book on the Bidens that any laws were broken. Instead, his reporting laid out a suggestive timeline that led readers to the inescapable conclusion that what had transpired reeked of influence-peddling and moral, if not legal, corruption\u2014the sort of self-dealing voters despise.\n\nAs they say about swampy Washington, the scandal isn\u2019t what\u2019s illegal\u2014the real scandal is what\u2019s legal. That is, what\u2019s assumed to be okay in Powertown, just as a matter of course.\n\nSo we can let David Marcus, writing for The Federalist, sum up what we know about Hunter and Ukraine:\n\nWe know that Hunter Biden took an extremely lucrative job from a Ukrainian energy concern for which he had no relevant experience. Is it really so strange for Americans to want to know if what he was really offering was access to the vice president?\n\nAnd about Hunter and China:\n\nLikewise we know that Hunter Biden traveled to China with his father on Air Force Two in 2013, and that during that trip he met with a Chinese banker, and 10 days after the trip the Chinese granted a license for a new fund on which Hunter was a board member.\n\nMarcus further adds:\n\nPerhaps these are just coincidences. Perhaps Hunter Biden possesses some vast expertise in business that he honed while snorting cocaine during his time in the Navy. But it does not seem completely unreasonable to imagine his proximity to the White House might have played a role in his hiring.\n\nSo there it is. Maybe it\u2019s all legal. But if it is all legal\u2014then that\u2019s the real scandal. In any case, soon enough, the voters might well be able to pass judgement on the Bidens.\n\nThere\u2019s More!\n\nYet even if some reporters, such as Green, are now conceding the basic reality of the Bidens, not all pressies are willing to do so\u2014or at least, they are vastly more eager, instead, to pound Trump.\n\nFor instance, The Washington Post jumped in with this headline: \u201cTrump\u2019s false claims about Hunter Biden\u2019s China dealings.\u201d The Post pointed to reports that Hunter had helped arrange a handshake between his father and a Chinese businessman (possible other details, such as a photograph, or words exchanged, were not mentioned). And then, 12 days later, Hunter joined the board of that businessman\u2019s company. Does that seem a little bit interesting?\n\nYet a lawyer for Hunter assured the Post that there was nothing to see: \u201cTo date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors.\u201d Such legalese might be good enough for the Post and most journalists, but the rest of us can spot the possible loopholes: Did Hunter possibly receive consulting fees, bonuses, equity stakes\u2014or free drugs?\n\nIn the meantime, GAI\u2019s Schweizer keeps pressing for answers; as he said on Fox News on October 3:\n\nThe bottom line is, at the end of the day, this needs to be investigated. What we know for a fact . . . is in Ukraine and in China \u2013 the only two countries where Joe Biden was the point person on U.S. foreign policy \u2013 his son cashed in big time in both countries. Why that in and of itself should not be investigated, I for the life of me can\u2019t understand. And do we want a country where political leaders, Republicans, Democrats, whoever, are cashing in that way? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nIn fact, others, too, are waiting for answers. For instance, here\u2019s conservative activist Phil Kerpen, tweeting on October 4:\n\nStill waiting for the non-corrupt theory of why Hunter Biden got paid about $3 million by Burisma to sit on its board while his dad was VP.\n\nYes, we\u2019re all still waiting for a good explanation for that not-so-mysterious mystery. In the meantime, there\u2019s both bad news and good news:\n\nThe bad news is that the swampy reality of the Bidens is there beneath our nose.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s not quite so hidden anymore.", "description": "The bad news is that the swampy reality of the Bidens is there beneath our nose.\u00a0The good news is that it\u2019s not quite so hidden anymore.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Joe-and-Hunter-Biden-Virgil-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
