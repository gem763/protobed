For more than 40 days, board members and campaign officials repeatedly refused to confirm or deny whether she was in fact affiliated.\n\nThen, just as The Daily Beast was set to publish a story about her claims, a response from the board materialized.\n\nAt 10:32 p.m. on Tuesday, Mark Serrano, identifying himself as a \u201cTrump Campaign Advisor,\u201d sent a brief statement.\n\n\u201cWe formed our advisory board in April of 2017, which now includes 19 tremendous advocates for President Trump,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAnn has not been, nor is she currently on the board.\u201d\n\nThere was no word on why the response had taken so long, if there was a misunderstanding of some kind, or if anyone from the board or campaign has asked Vandersteel to cease and desist.\n\nVandersteel did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But her biography is riddled with reasons for Team Trump to run for the hills.\n\nVandersteel, president of the far-right media outlet YourVoice America, is firmly on the fringe.\n\nShe has tweeted that the nonsensical Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking Democrats operate a pedophile sex dungeon out of a Washington, D.C. pizzeria is \u201call true\u201d and \u201creal.\u201d Vandersteel has also promoted debunked 9/11 conspiracy theories, suggesting in January that a bomb brought down the World Trade Center\u2019s Building 7 site. She has championed QAnon, the bizarre conspiracy theory that posits that Trump is engaged in a secret war with a global cabal of Democratic pedophiles. And she has claimed that nearly 80 percent of world leaders are pedophiles.\n\nEven for Team Trump, which has attracted some interesting characters along the way, her views are extreme. But for over a month, the Trump campaign and its advisory board of media surrogates remained silent as she insisted she was an official part of the #MAGA team.\n\nVandersteel, an associate of Trump sycophantic radio personality Bill Mitchell, has repeatedly claimed on-air to be a hand-picked member of the advisory board. Her LinkedIn page says that she\u2019s part of the board. Vandersteel had also listed her presence on the board on her Twitter bio, only to delete that mention a few weeks ago.\n\nThe repeated references to board membership drew the attention of some outlets, including Right Wing Watch, when she began making them in mid-December. She made the same claim again this month in an appearance on a YouTube show devoted to analyzing QAnon, saying that she had been \u201cselected\u201d to be a \u201csurrogate for the Trump campaign\u201d and to do \u201cthese public television hits every now and then.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast\u2019s initial inquiries about Vandersteel were sent to Serrano, who acts as a point of contact for board members, as well as several senior 2020 Trump campaign officials, on December 12.\n\nIn the time since and up until this week, The Daily Beast has repeatedly reached out to seven people for this story and sent at least two dozen emails, phone calls, and messages asking for information and for comment. Almost all declined to comment on the record, ignored inquiries, or would not give a straight answer on if, at any point, Vandersteel had been a member or approached to be a part of the board.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Marc Lotter, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s former press secretary and a prominent member of the 2020 board, told The Daily Beast that he was \u201cnot familiar with this person [Vandersteel], and not aware of their participation on the board.\u201d Lotter stressed that he is not a spokesman for the Trump advisory board and directed further inquiries to Serrano.\n\nFinally, on Tuesday evening, a person familiar with the Trump campaign\u2019s operations\u2014who would not agree to let their affiliation or name be made publicly known in this story\u2014simply wrote: \u201cThe campaign\u2019s advisory board was launched in April 2017, made up of tremendous advocates for President Trump, and currently consists of the following members below. Anyone else claiming to be a board member or official surrogate for the campaign at this time is mistaken.\u201d\n\nThe source sent along a chart showing 19 members such as Pastor Darrell Scott, former governor of Arizona Jan Brewer, Jerry Falwell Jr., and former Trump economic adviser Steve Moore. Vandersteel is not listed.\n\nOnly hours later that night did Serrano ultimately decide to send a more definitive, on-the-record statement that actually addressed \u201cAnn.\u201d\n\nThe shambolic nature of the response to questions regarding the pro-Trump, Pizzagate-promoting online commentator is in part indicative of the fact that the Trump 2020 operation does not yet have an in-house, up-and-running communications and press apparatus. The top campaign brass are working to build out staff early this year, though no personnel announcements are forthcoming at this time.\n\nHowever, former White House spokesman Raj Shah had preliminary discussions last year with Trump\u2019s senior adviser Jared Kushner and campaign manager Brad Parscale about aiding the 2020 comms shop, two sources told The Daily Beast.\n\nSo far, it does not appear Shah has made the jump back to Team Trump. Earlier this month, he announced he had just landed a new gig at lobbying firm Ballard Partners.", "description": "Ann Vandersteel is way out there, even by Trumpland standards.
