They tried to explain to the child that now your dad is a martyr and he is going to Paradise, so the child thought that if he died, he would see his dad. He hung himself with a scarf.\u201d\n\nToxic stress\n\nPsychologist Marcia Brophy spoke to 458 Syrian adults and children for the report.\n\nShe says living in a constant state of fear and anxiety, known as \u201ctoxic stress\u201d, can lead to serious long-term health issues.\n\n\u201cThese children, their bodies are in constant \u2018fight or flight\u2019 \u2013 and that accumulative level of toxic stress will undoubtedly have huge, long-term consequences. It could lead to lifelong medical issues as well,\u201d Brophy said.\n\nMore and more children are self-harming, taking drugs and attempting suicide, Brophy says, and they are doing so at an increasingly younger age.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly touching. But it is not really surprising, given that these children are living in a highly stressful environment. It is a way of coping and dealing with a really abnormal, stressful situation.\u201d\n\nBrophy says communities should talk more openly about mental health and aid agencies must make mental health support a priority across all humanitarian situations.\n\n\u201cIt is a taboo issue, it is very hard to talk about. Given that this is a protracted conflict situation, we need to have mental health and psychological support integrated into any emergency response.\u201d\n\nWhat Save the Children wants\n\nIn addition to an immediate ceasefire and a negotiated end to the violence, the charity is calling for:\n\nAll parties to stop using explosive materials in populated areas and attacking civilian infrastructure liek schools and hospitals, as this clearly came through as the main cause of children\u2019s distress and fear\n\nAn immediate end to siege tactics and unrestricted access to all areas, so that agencies like Save the Children and its partners can reach the most vulnerable\n\nDonors to make a new global commitment tp support children\u2019s mental health and wellbeing in emergencies, including sufficient funding for mental health and psychosocial programming inside Syria\n\nKevin Watkins is CEO of Save the Children.\n\n\u201cWhat this research shows is that we are witnessing a mental health crisis among children, brought about by six years of war in Syria. Children are soiling themselves when they hear a loud noise.They are terrified to play outside, afraid to go to school even though they are worried their futures will be ruined without an education.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a tragedy that must be stopped \u2013 we can end the toxic stress many children are suffering by stopping the bombardment of civilian areas and reaching everyone with life-saving aid and psychological support.\u201d\n\nRead the full Save the Children report here", "description": "Youngsters living in the war-torn country are self-harming, taking drugs and attempting suicide to escape the horrors they have endured after six years of conflict, according to a new report by Save t", "authors": ["Catherine Hardy", "Marcia Brophy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/359858/1000x563_359858.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-08"}
