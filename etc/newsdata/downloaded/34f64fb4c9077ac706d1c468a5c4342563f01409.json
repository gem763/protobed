Those \"experiences\" included the purported co-founder of a company that was acquired by Yahoo. However, left out of the sales pitch was that three states \u2014 North Dakota, Colorado and Massachusetts \u2014 had issued cease-and-desist orders against Parker and Social Voucher, SEC officials said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe money was purported to be used to develop and launch a Social Voucher app. But the SEC said investors weren\u2019t informed that between 35 and 50 percent of their investments were actually being used to pay commissions to the sales agents who recruited them. At least $9.6 million went to paying commissions.\n\nParker also misappropriated at least $4.6 million, according to the SEC. He used more than $2 million to pay off his expenses at two Seminole casinos, took out another $2 million through cash withdrawals and used about $590,000 for personal expenses.\n\nAltogether, 68% of the investors\u2019 cash went to \u201cundisclosed, non-business purposes,\u201d the SEC said in the complaint.\n\n\u201cWith much less money available to develop and launch the purported mobile coupon application, the likelihood that Social Voucher would be successful diminished significantly,\u201d officials wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The company also paid sales commissions of as much as 50 percent.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/SEC20Securities20and20Exchange20RTR20FBN.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
