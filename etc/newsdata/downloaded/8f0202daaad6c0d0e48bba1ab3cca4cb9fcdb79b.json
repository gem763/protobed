This is consistent with a steady increase dating back to 2000. Whether you need additional income or not, you might be thinking about working in retirement too. But there are a few things to keep in mind, like what it means for your taxes, whether it could impact your Social Security benefits and how you would continue to build savings. Weighing the pros and cons can help you decide if working in retirement is worth it.\n\nThe Benefits of Working In Retirement\n\nWorking in retirement can provide much more than a paycheck. The key benefits include:\n\nIncome that supplements your retirement savings and boosts your quality of life\n\nThe opportunity to continue saving for retirement in a 401(k) or Roth IRA\n\nIncreased Social Security benefits if your job enables you to delay payments\n\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance and retirement plans (with exceptions)\n\nStructure, stimulation and social interaction\n\nIt can also fulfill a sense of purpose or help you pursue a lifelong goal. You might not have time to do everything you wanted, such as mentoring or starting your own business, during your peak working years. You could also use this time to try a new role or completely different career path. No matter what your motivation, keeping it in mind can help you make the most of the experience.\n\nThe Physical and Mental Challenges of Working In Retirement\n\nUnretiring has its appeal, but there could be some things complicating your decision. Your health is one of the biggest considerations. Even if you want to work in retirement, an illness or injury could throw a wrench in your plans. And ongoing health conditions may require you to cut back on the number of hours you\u2019re working or force you to step away completely.\n\nOn the other hand, work could raise your stress levels or put your heath at risk. It will also cut into time you probably plan to spend with family or pursuing hobbies. Before you make your decision, you should weigh the benefits of working against any trade-offs you might be making.\n\nHow Working Longer Can Impact Social Security\n\nHere's everything you need to know about working in retirement. More\n\nWorking in your golden years can give your household income a boost, which is helpful if you didn\u2019t save for retirement as much as you would have liked. But it could impact other sources of income. Let\u2019s start with Social Security, which you can begin taking at age 62. You can continue to draw benefits while working, but collecting a paycheck and Social Security at the same time could directly affect your benefit amount.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Social Security rules for taking benefits while working read:\n\nIf you\u2019re under your full retirement age for the entire year, $1 is deducted from your benefit payments for every $2 you earn above the annual limit. (The limit for 2019 is $17,640.)\n\nIn the year you reach full retirement age, $1 in benefits is deducted for every $3 you earn above a different limit for each month before reaching full retirement age. (For 2019, the limit is $46,920.)\n\nThat money will be added back to your checks when you reach full retirement age, but your total payment will be lower. The Social Security Administration will recalculate your benefit amount to exclude the months when your benefits were reduced or withheld because your earnings from work were over the allowed limit.\n\nIf your income from working is enough to cover your household expenses, delaying your Social Security benefits might be the better option. For each year you delay your benefits beyond your normal retirement age, up to age 70, your benefit amount increases. If you\u2019re able to wait until age 70, you\u2019d receive 132% of your benefit amount.\n\nAdditional Financial Implications\n\nOther retirement income works the opposite way. For a traditional 401(k) and IRA, you have to start taking minimum distributions at age 70.5. These plans also restrict contributions once you reach a certain age. However, you could continue make contributions to a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA as long as you have earned income for the year.\n\nYou may want to think about your earning potential while working in retirement, too. If you\u2019re staying on with your current employer, you can probably expect to continue earning the same amount. However, if you retire and then return to the workforce, you may find it difficult to get a job with your former salary. At that point, you would be competing with workers who might be willing to fill an opening for less money.\n\nHow to Decide If Working In Retirement Is Worth It\n\nYour decision ultimately depends on what you need financially and what you want your retirement to look like. Asking the right questions can help you get some clarity on whether continuing to work really makes sense.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Nearly 19%, or 9 million, Americans ages 65 and over are working part- or full-time, according to a recent Pew Research Center analysis.
