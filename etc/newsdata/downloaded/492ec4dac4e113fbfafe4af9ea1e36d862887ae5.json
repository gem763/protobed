People pass near on Parliament Hill the morning after the federal election in Ottawa\n\nBy Jim Morris\n\nVANCOUVER (Reuters) - Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg addressed a rally in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Friday in the latest leg of her global campaign to spark action to tackle rising carbon emissions.\n\nThe 16-year-old Swede has been touring North America leading youth climate strikes after addressing the United Nations Climate Action Summit last month, where she denounced world leaders in a passionate speech for being slow to fight global warming.\n\n\"The people in power need to realize what they are doing to future generations,\" Thunberg said, addressing the crowd from the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery. \"We are not just some kids skipping school. We are a wave of change and together we are unstoppable.\"\n\nThis week Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals won the most seats in Canada's federal election but lost the parliamentary majority. Trudeau needs support from other parties to govern, most likely the left-leaning New Democrats, who want greater urgency in fighting climate change.\n\nThe NDP are also opposed to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which would nearly triple the flow of crude from Alberta's oil sands to the Port of Vancouver.\n\nTrudeau's government bought the pipeline in 2018 for C$4.5 billion to help it get built but the project is opposed by environmental and indigenous activists and has been delayed by repeated court challenges.\n\nOrganisers Sustainabiliteens Vancouver said the aim of the first climate march after the election was to show the government their persistence.\n\nPolice estimated 8,000 people took part in the march through downtown Vancouver. Protesters spanning all ages were led by indigenous drummers and singers and carried banners and signs, including one large cut-out of a hippopotamus emblazoned with the words \"Justin the hippocrit.\"\n\nThe protest started with a news conference announcing legal action by 15 young Canadians who are suing the federal government for failing to act on climate change. Indigenous leaders also addressed the crowd.
