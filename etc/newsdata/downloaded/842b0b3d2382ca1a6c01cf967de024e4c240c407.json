During the interview, she was asked if she knew Ruiz, the 44-year-old owner of La Cubana restaurant in NYC, who was a regular on Guy Fieri\u2019s Food Network shows and friends with many of the network\u2019s stars.\n\nPaula Deen made a tasteless joke about death of celebrity chef Carl Ruiz. (Photo: Aaron Davidson/Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u201d familiar with him, Deen, who genuinely seemed caught off-guard, replied, \u201cbut I\u2019m so sorry to hear that.\u201d\n\nHowever, she then said, \u201cYou know, they say the restaurant business will kill ya,\u201d cackling at her joke. She then added, \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d\n\nA rep for Deen has not responded to Yahoo's emails requesting comment.\n\nThey discuss Ruiz at the 7:10 mark:\n\nThe host ultimately changed the topic to how Deen got her start in the food world, but the comment didn\u2019t go unnoticed. One person wrote on Twitter that it was \u201csad\u201d to see Deen \u201conce again speak without thinking, adding that \u201capparently she didn\u2019t learn her lesson after losing her empire after racial slurs several years ago.\u201d\n\nHow sad to see Paula Deen once again speak without thinking about Chef Carl Ruiz\u2019s untimely death.\n\nApparently, she didn\u2019t learn her lesson after losing her empire after racial slurs several years ago.\n\nIs it insensitivity or just plain ignorance? I\u2019m thinking the latter. \u2014 Susan Brocker (@smbrocker) September 24, 2019\n\nAnother person, baffled by the joke, said he was glad she was no longer on the Food Network.\n\n@GuyFieri is there a specific reason @Paula_Deen would make this joke about #CarlRuiz on the radio \u201cYou know, they say the restaurant business will kill ya,\u201d she said before cackling and adding, \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d Glad she is not at @FoodNetwork \u2014 jw (@burgundylue) September 24, 2019\n\nIt was also called a \u201csick joke.\u201d\n\nSick joke. Sick answer. \u2014 lisekane (@lisekane2) September 24, 2019\n\nSome of the other reactions to Deen\u2019s comment weren\u2019t worded as thoughtfully.\n\nOf course, the \u201closing her empire\u201d reference was about Deen admitting to using the N-word while being deposed in a discrimination lawsuit in 2013. As a result, her business, which had pulled in an estimated $17 million the year before, unraveled and the Food Network severed ties with her. However, she\u2019s continued to open restaurants and release cookbooks, including her latest, Paula Deen's Southern Baking: 125 Favorite Recipes from My Savannah Kitchen, which she was promoting on the radio show.\n\nRuiz\u2019s unexpected death \u2014 on Saturday of a suspected heart attack \u2014 was announced in a post on his restaurant\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nFieri paid tribute to his \u201cgreat friend,\u201d who appeared on three of his shows: Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, Guy\u2019s Grocery Games and Guy\u2019s Ranch Kitchen. He said a friend like Ruiz was \u201cone in a million.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m heartbroken that my friend chef Carl Ruiz is gone. I have no words to describe what a great friend he was to me and my family. His ability to make me laugh and smile under any circumstances was only outshined by his talent as a chef. pic.twitter.com/einY8qp7wf \u2014 Guy Fieri (@GuyFieri) September 22, 2019\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve met a lot of great people but a friend like Carl is one in a hundred million. Carl \u2019The Cuban\u2019 Ruiz will forever live on in my heart and in those of all who loved him. \u2014 Guy Fieri (@GuyFieri) September 22, 2019\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
