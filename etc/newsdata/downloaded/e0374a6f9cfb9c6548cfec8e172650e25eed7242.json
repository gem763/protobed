Games participants use a calligraphy brush and ink to write a few Chinese characters and even see how their names are written in Chinese.\n\nFor the international athletes, Chinese paintings and calligraphy are top choices for souvenirs.\n\nOne of the volunteers, Huang Danping, said during peak periods, around 700 athletes try their hand at calligraphy each day. With the help of volunteers, many get their names painted on T-shirts.\n\nIndonesian athlete Agus Prayogo bought a Chinese painting at the village and said he loves Chinese culture, especially characters written with a calligraphy brush.\n\nThe painting he chose features a character Jing, which means \"tranquility\".\n\nHe said this character always brings a sense of the Zen Buddhist philosophy to his mind.\n\nXinhua", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/23/5dafaeb2a310cf3e97a2874d.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
