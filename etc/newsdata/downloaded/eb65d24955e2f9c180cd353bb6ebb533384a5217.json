Condemning these elephants to a life of captivity in Chinese zoos is a tragedy.\n\nOver a hundred elephants have reportedly been sold by Zimbabwe since 2012, campaigners say (Getty) More\n\n\u201cWe and others have been working for months to try and stop these elephants being shipped because all that awaits them in China is a life of monotonous deprivation in zoos or circuses.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAs an elephant biologist used to observing these magnificent animals in their natural wild habitat, I am devastated by this outcome. These animals should be roaming in the wild with their families but, instead, they have been ripped away from their mothers for more than a year and now sold off for lifelong captivity\u201d.\n\nThe apparent removal of the elephants to China comes days after more than 55 elephants died at Zimbabwe\u2019s Hwange National Park amid one of the country\u2019s worst droughts in recent years.\n\nInvestigations showed that at least 55 elephants had died from lack of food and water in the park, which holds the biggest elephant herd of 50,000 animals \u2013 three times the park\u2019s capacity.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the Zimbabwean embassy in London for comment on the alleged sale.", "description": "Wildlife campaigners have said they are \u201coutraged and heartbroken\u201d at reports authorities in Zimbabwe have sold more than 30 wild baby elephants to China, where they will endure a lifetime in captivity.Animal protection experts at Humane Society International (HSI) said the baby elephants had already", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jxkY.K_8X30mFqTW5Zt_dw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/7c6275755bc3d231fccf0dba8b542740", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
