Benjamin Rottenborn said last month: 'Mr. Depp cannot seek to litigate the truth of Ms. Heard's allegations about his violent and abusive behaviour while intoxicated, insist on proceeding without a protective order, and then blithely refuse to produce evidence that confirms the truth of those allegations on grounds of relevance and privacy.'\n\nHowever, Johnny's lawyers have accused Heard's team of trying to get access to his medical files to go on a 'fishing expedition' to embarrass and 'harass' him.\n\nDespite Depp's claims that it was irrelevant, the judge decided to allow the application made on behalf of Heard.\n\nHeard's team did not name of the other partners they claim he may have been abusive towards.\n\nNight out: Depp is suing ex-wife Amber Heard, 33, for $50million claiming she defamed him by writing an op-ed in 2016 about domestic violence\n\nDefamation: Johnny's lawyers have accused Heard's team of trying to get access to his medical files to go on a 'fishing expedition' to embarrass and 'harass' him\n\n'He says he is not a perpetrator of domestic violence. So we have requested documents relating to Mr. Depp's commission of domestic violence against other romantic partners,' her lawyer, Ben Rottenborn, said.\n\nThe judge then asked why he had stated in his lawsuit that he had never been domestically violent towards anyone.\n\nHis attorney said: 'Mr. Depp understood that this case, since the public op-ed, is going to be in the public press. And so it's important for him to say that.'\n\nShe also said it was 'troubling' that Depp's actors submitted claims in their lawsuit against Heard for the purpose of having them reported on by the media.\n\nAbuse? Heard has submitted photos in previous proceedings which she claims show injuries Depp gave her; he has long denied being violent towards her and is suing her for defamation\n\nHeard's lawyers previously tried to keep the case private.\n\nShe said she did not want aspects of her personal life or of the lives of people close to them to be made public.\n\nDepp's attorneys have repeatedly claimed he has 'nothing to hide'.\n\nHis lawyer told DailyMail.com that Heard's latest claims were part of a 'notorious abuse hoax.'\n\n'Having been sued for defamation her notorious abuse hoax, Amber Heard\u2019s #TimesUp lawyer doesn\u2019t waste any time trying to prove the unprovable, or dispute the mountain of evidence showing her fraud.\n\n'Instead, they do what the guilty always do, compounding the original crime with new false abuse allegations and other smearing innuendo. There is a public trial February 3, and that is when truth replaces PR.'", "description": "The actor, 56, looked in high spirits as he rocked out to the star-studded crowd at at the opening of  the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, on Thursday night.", "authors": ["Emer Scully For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/08/20170252-0-image-a-28_1571990223185.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
