It was a stark warning of things to come.\n\nThe table was green, the floor was green, her daughter's hands and hair were green.\n\nBut the hard work was done and her daughter ran a bath and dropped in their homemade addition.\n\nNot long after, Kerri received a call of 'mum, come here!' from the bathroom.\n\n\"I trudged to the bathroom, swung open the door, and nearly choked on my own tongue,\" she says. \"What I saw was horrifying.\n\n\"My daughter stood in the bath, arms above her head, laughing hysterically. My precious child was emerald green.\n\n\u201cLook, mum! I\u2019m an alien!\u201d\n\nNot only was her child green, but so too was the bath water, the bath and much of wall.\n\nKerri describes it as 'not just a splash of colour' but as though the Incredible Hulk had laid down in their bath and 'melted'.\n\nThe mum says she eventually got bathroom clean, although glints of emerald remain in the grouting.\n\nKmart said it wasn't aware of any issues with the make-your-own-bath-bomb kit but encouraged any other customers who have experienced similar problems to get in touch.\n\nA spokesperson said: \u201cAt Kmart Australia we are committed to the quality and safety of all of our products. We have not received an inquiry of this nature, but we welcome the opportunity to resolve this directly with the customer.\"\n\nHave you ever had a disaster with a beauty product?
