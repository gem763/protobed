The centerpiece, musically, is Yardfest, a free concert on the campus\u2019s main quad. Over the years, it has featured surprise appearances by Drake, Jay-Z, Kanye West and the Notorious B.I.G., and it has gained a reputation for showcasing up-and-coming hip-hop artists; last year\u2019s featured acts were A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Lil Baby and Gunna, with Slick Rick appealing to the older alumni. While the lineup isn\u2019t announced until the last minute, attendance at Yardfest is usually a gamble worth taking. Noon. Free.\n\nAD\n\n\u2018The Price Is Right Live\u2019 at MGM National Harbor: If you think you\u2019d be pretty good at Plinko, put your money where your mouth is when \u201cThe Price Is Right Live\u201d makes a stop for multiple shows at the Theater at MGM National Harbor. The traveling version (which does not include TV host Drew Carey) of the long-running daytime game show will invite D.C.-area residents to \u201ccome on down\u201d and test their consumer smarts to win prizes and cash.

Silver Spring\u2019s Silver Branch Brewing, known for its continental-style lagers and ales, launches its first Oktoberfest with a three-day celebration that, at various times, will include the tapping of its Silver Branch M\u00e4rzen beer, live music, German-style food, stein-holding contests, best-dressed contests and family activities on its courtyard patio. Admission is free, though the brewery also offers a $50 \u201cpassport\u201d that includes three liters of beer, a one-liter commemorative mug and an enamel pin. 11 a.m. to midnight. Free admission.\n\nAD\n\nBedouine at Songbyrd: Good music should transport you, so it\u2019s fitting that a faithful interpreter of this theory is Azniv Korkejian, who fashions songs as Bedouine. You could look at Korkejian\u2019s nomadic life and find the inspiration for the name \u2014 she was born to Armenian parents in Syria, spent her childhood in Saudi Arabia and immigrated to the United States \u2014 but instead tune your ears toward the missives in her latest album, \u201cBird Songs of a Killjoy,\u201d and join her on a journey. Korkejian\u2019s songs are folk-inspired (the timbre of her voice can also evoke Brazilian bossa nova troubadours) and radiate a calming warmth that sends you closer toward bliss. 8 p.m. $15-$17.\n\nAD\n\nSaturday, Oct. 12\n\nSnallygaster at Pennsylvania Avenue and Sixth Street NW: One year after rebooting Washington\u2019s biggest beer festival by moving to a prime spot on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Snallygaster is switching to an all-you-can-drink format for 2019. You\u2019ll still find around 400 great beers from the likes of Hill Farmstead, Other Half and Jester King, with pFriem, Dewey Beer Co. and Hoof Hearted joining the party for the first time.

Like last year, the All Things Go Fall Classic is the rare music festival to put a focus on female performers (only three acts on the bill don\u2019t feature a woman). Scottish synth-pop band Chvrches and electro-pop singer Melanie Martinez, respectively, top Saturday\u2019s and Sunday\u2019s lineup. The two days also include sets from the buzzy, all-caps bands LANY and COIN, Pride festival favorite Betty Who, and the mysterious singer Allie X. Through Sunday.

They\u2019re heritage varieties, such as the tart Newtown Pippin, beloved by Thomas Jefferson, or the bittersweet Bulmer\u2019s Norman, which are baked in pies or pressed into cider. During its annual Explorer\u2019s Festival, tastings of more than 20 varieties show off their different flavors; cooking classes demonstrate why some types of apples taste better in pies, while others are best pressed for juice. (After the demos, you\u2019ll have a better idea of what you want to pick in the orchard.) Distillery Lane\u2019s 16 different hard ciders will be available for tasting and purchase, in addition to \u201csoft\u201d nonalcoholic versions. Through Sunday. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.

Arts Center 30th anniversary party at the Cheshire: Ian Fay, a local film producer, had a solid vision of what the Cheshire would be when he began renovating an early 20th-century luxury car garage in August 2018, but the odds were against him. The Cheshire, which opened in July, is partly funded through five studios that are rented by such tenants as furniture brand Nos/Nos, clothing company Tribute and Fay\u2019s film company, Lookout Productions. Ticketed events, organized by Pakke, also help keep the lights on. Those events include this weekend\u2019s celebration of Adams Morgan\u2019s D.C. Arts Center, which will host a variety of artists in the DIY space and have live performances by local music staples Park Snakes and Cigarette. 6 p.m. to midnight. $20-$100.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSunday, Oct. 13\n\nOyster Wars at the Salt Line: Riverfront restaurant the Salt Line celebrates bivalves and beer at its third annual Oyster Wars party, which draws chefs and reps from oyster farms and breweries from the Mid-Atlantic on up to New England.
