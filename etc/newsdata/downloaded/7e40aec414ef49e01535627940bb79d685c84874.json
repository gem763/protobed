It was an instant hit with fans and became her trademark nickname during her rise to stardom, which culminated with a victory over Charlotte and Ronda Rousey in the WrestleMania 35 main event.\n\nRic Flair admitted to TMZ that his desire to receive compensation for the nickname, which he used alongside the Nature Boy during his storied career, has caused a rift with his daughter.\n\nThe 70-year-old 16-time world champion has dealt with a variety of health issues in recent years, including a monthlong ICU trip in 2017, and said his main focus is making sure he can provide his wife Wendy Barlow and family financial security after his death.\n\n\"When I almost died two years ago, one person [Wendy] stayed by me,\" Ric Flair said. \"The whole time\u201431 days in the ICU, 12 days while I was dying on a respirator\u2014and I'm gonna take care of her, and her family, and my family that has taken care of me no matter what.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't care what the WWE thinks of me personally. I know they love me, but obviously they've lost respect for me.\"\n\nRic Flair said he'd still allow Lynch to use the phrase if his trademark application is successful as long as WWE compensates him for it.", "description": "Wrestling legend  Ric Flair  said he's filed a trademark application for the term \"The Man\" and is trying to work out a private agreement with  WWE  for its continued use by Raw women's ...", "authors": ["Tim Daniels"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/680/hi-res-437b00bb40e37d8e29e695f7594b9fe5_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
