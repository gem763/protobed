Impeachment makes for strange bedfellows.\n\nSome polls, like Fox\u2019s, will tell you that Americans support impeaching and removing the president on balance. That\u2019s noteworthy but the leadership of both parties will pay closer attention to what swing states think for obvious reasons. The Times wanted to know how the Democrats\u2019 impeachment push was doing in the six states most likely to decide the next election \u2014 Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona. They discovered that voters there do support the impeachment inquiry, by a 50/45 margin.\n\nBut when you ask how many are ready to take the fateful next step and remove Trump based on what\u2019s currently known, a small but significant minority of seven percent switches sides. Impeachment/removal polls at just 43/53. Wha\u2019 happened?\n\nThe Times\u2019s Nate Cohn dug into the numbers to find out who those seven percent are.\n\nThis 7 percent slice of respondents tends to be younger \u2014 33 percent are 18 to 34 \u2014 and nearly half are self-identified independents. They could prove tough for Democrats to convince: 51 percent say that the president\u2019s conduct is typical of most politicians, perhaps suggesting that they hold a jaded view of politics that would tend to minimize the seriousness of the allegations against him.\n\nI would not have guessed that some younger adults, a famously left-leaning group, would be more hesitant to remove Trump than others in the contingent that supports an impeachment inquiry. Another interesting bit of data from Cohn:\n\nThat trend is also true among Democrats specifically, a group that otherwise favors impeachment and removal overwhelmingly. Among Dems overall, 83 percent want Trump out. But among Dems who are following the Ukraine story \u201cnot very closely,\u201d 21 percent oppose impeachment.\n\nWhich way does all of that cut for Pelosi? Before you answer, read this NBC piece about how House Democrats are preparing to present their impeachment case to the public. The key words are \u201cabuse of power.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are zeroing in on a framework for their impeachment case against President Donald Trump that will center on a simple \u201cabuse of power\u201d narrative involving the president\u2019s actions regarding Ukraine, according to multiple people familiar with the deliberations\u2026 [O]ne person familiar with the strategy said \u201cabuse of power\u201d when it comes to Ukraine is the \u201cbig point that Pelosi has been hammering home\u201d and the umbrella under which \u201cthis all fits to connect it and help the public understand.\u201d\u2026 Pelosi is also considering a separate article on obstruction or contempt of Congress related to the administration\u2019s blanket rejection of subpoena requests for documents and witnesses related to its inquiry into Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, according to multiple sources involved in the deliberations.\n\nThe Ukraine quid pro quo and the White House\u2019s refusal to comply with Democratic demands for evidence will all go under the \u201cabuse of power\u201d heading. Looking again at Cohn\u2019s data, though, I wonder if \u201cabuse of power\u201d might be especially unpersuasive to that stubborn seven percent that\u2019s so jaded about politics that they\u2019re inclined to see Trump\u2019s behavior as business as usual in Washington. Seems to me that that group might logically demand something more \u2014 probable cause of an actual federal statutory crime, for instance, or strong evidence that Trump himself was sufficiently aware that the Ukraine business was shady that he took steps to conceal his motives \u2014 in order to distinguish what he did from normal Beltway scumbaggery. Think of all the ways the average politician abuses his power, man. Isn\u2019t Pelosi abusing her power when she serves special interests and lobbyists instead of the public?\n\nAs others have noted, the sheer cynicism of a political culture capable of electing Trump as a sort of purgative might also be what rescues him from impeachment in the end.\n\nIn fact, peek into the crosstabs and you\u2019ll find that a plurality of all Americans agrees that what Trump did was \u201ctypical\u201d of politicians, not something extraordinary. How do you sell an \u201cabuse of power\u201d narrative in those circumstances?\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that the people who are following the impeachment saga the least closely right now are also the people who are least likely to support it suggests that there may be room for Democrats to grow their support here. Cohn notes elsewhere that impeachment polling lately has been flat after an initial burst of enthusiasm when the first bombshells about Trump and Ukraine began being reported. But maybe that\u2019s because the news itself has plateaued; right now there\u2019s little to report apart from the secretive questioning of witnesses being conducted by Adam Schiff\u2019s committee. That is, the \u201cnot following closely\u201d group has had no compelling reason to start following the story closely over the last weeks. But obviously that will change once the articles of impeachment pass, and it will change in a big, big way once the trial of Donald J. Trump is being held on C-SPAN for hours each day in December. Many more Americans will soon be following the Ukraine matter more closely than they have been, whether they want to or not. What happens to the numbers on removal once they are?\n\nYou could turn that question around, though. Instead of assuming that following the story closely is leading people towards support for removing Trump, it may be that preexisting support for removing Trump is leading people to follow the story closely. If you\u2019re a Trump fan, it stands to reason that you wouldn\u2019t be eager to follow the Ukraine story closely to this point. If you\u2019re already predisposed to ignore unflattering news about the president because you like him and think his enemies are out to get him, how likely is your opinion to change after an impeachment trial realistically? We may be looking at the same 43/53 swing-state split two months from now that we\u2019re looking at today.\n\nAnd look: For impeachment purposes, there\u2019s arguably no difference between 53/43 in favor of removal and 43/53 against. Senate Republicans aren\u2019t going to remove the president based on a margin as slim as that either way. The significance of Cohn\u2019s results is that impeachment may not be much of a club for Democrats in next fall\u2019s election either. At a minimum, what they want from this process is an effective talking point they can use to beat Trump at the polls. \u201cRepublicans in the Senate didn\u2019t have the guts to oust the president, but the polls show that swing-state voters disagree with them and fully intend to correct that mistake in November.\u201d Per the Times, swing-state voters do not disagree. If this really does settle as a 43/53 issue in places like Michigan, we may not hear the Democratic nominee hammering impeachment on the trail much next year. In which case, what will Dems have gained from this?", "description": "Overreach.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-17.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
