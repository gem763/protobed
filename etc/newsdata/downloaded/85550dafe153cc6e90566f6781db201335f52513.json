As his presidency enters its most dramatic phase yet, just one year ahead of the 2020 election, he might be right.\n\nIn mid-September, 94 percent of Republicans opposed impeachment. A month later\u2014after the news about Donald Trump\u2019s fateful phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and after House Democrats formally launched an impeachment inquiry\u2014their views are essentially unchanged. Even with these revelations, 93 percent of Republicans remained opposed to impeachment in mid-October, according to data released today from the Public Religion Research Institute. Of all Republican voters, two subgroups stand out for their unwavering support of Trump: those who primarily get their news from Fox, and white evangelical Christians.\n\nRead: Why some Christians \u201clove the meanest parts\u201d of Trump\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget now, but during the 2016 primary, white Christians were intensely divided over Trump. Many religious voters in deep-red pockets of the country preferred Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is more clearly one of their own, or Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has championed socially conservative policies, over a reality-television star who once incorrectly referred to a book of the Bible as \u201cTwo Corinthians\u201d during a speech at an evangelical university. But since 2016, these voters, along with Republicans generally, have consolidated behind the president. According to the new PRRI data, one year after Trump\u2019s election, 59 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they would prefer for Trump to remain the party\u2019s nominee in 2020. Two years after his election, 66 percent said the same thing. And this fall, 72 percent said they want their party to keep Trump. Within this group, white evangelicals were among the voters most likely to want Trump on the ballot, at 82 percent.", "description": "New polling suggests that Trump\u2019s base is totally unified behind the president, no matter what investigations might reveal.", "authors": ["Emma Green"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX3G9U3/facebook.jpg?1571589490", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
