(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nThe novelty of firsts will soon wear off. Game days will come with unceasing frequency and Rui Hachimura\u2019s inaugural season with the Washington Wizards will become routine. Still, the rookie selected ninth overall in this summer\u2019s NBA draft made his exhibition opener Monday night appear like one of many highlights coming in his 2019-20 season reel.\n\nBefore the Wizards\u2019 104-99 loss to the New York Knicks, Hachimura described almost everything as exciting, from his first morning shoot-around to his start at power forward. The more fitting adjective for the night, however, might have been comfortable. That summed up the way Hachimura handled his first action in front of the most loyal of fans, who eschewed playoff baseball in the city to watch a preseason basketball game.\n\nInside Capital One Arena, where a smattering of 9,420 ticket holders evaluated the new-look Wizards, Hachimura played 21 minutes, judiciously took his shots and still finished with 12 points on 4-of-7 shooting. Hachimura also assisted on two makes, grabbed four rebounds and appeared steady while matching up against the athletic Julius Randle and combustible Marcus Morris.\n\n\u201cThe guy, the weirdest thing, he\u2019s like a wise veteran already,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said of the 21-year-old Hachimura. \u201cHe just plays with a real calm influence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see,\u201d Brooks continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t see a lot of young players play this way.\u201d\n\nUnlike most rookies, Hachimura has the additional pressure of playing as the first Japanese-born first-round NBA draft pick. Throughout this season, Hachimura will be followed and documented like a global sports icon. Before the game, as Hachimura sat with player development coach David Adkins, reviewing notes and watching video clips on a laptop, three cameramen on the baseline zoomed in on his lesson.\n\nHachimura never noticed the extra attention \u2014 he hasn\u2019t all training camp when as many as 10 Japanese media outlets have attended practices. By game time, on a court he had never played on before, Hachimura looked like the player Washington grew interested in through his three years at Gonzaga and the one who has fit in with Wizards teammates since returning from the FIBA World Cup.\n\n\u201cI was comfortable because we\u2019ve practiced for almost two weeks, three weeks now,\u201d Hachimura said. \u201cI just played like that, the way we\u2019ve been playing. Yeah, it was great.\u201d\n\nHachimura hit a pullup jumper over Randle for his first basket. Then, before four minutes had passed in the opening quarter, he lured Randle into his second foul. But Hachimura waited before expanding his game beyond midrange looks and drives to the rim. When presented with his first deep look, Hachimura, who attempted only 76 three-pointers in college, dribbled out of the right corner. Later in the third quarter, Hachimura had another corner three but made a split decision to pass while still in the air.\n\nHis three-point timidity notwithstanding \u2014 Hachimura attempted one deep look and swished it \u2014 Hachimura looked far more relaxed than Knicks rookie R.J. Barrett, the third overall draft pick in this year\u2019s class.\n\nWhile Hachimura\u2019s big moment happened as he attacked from the perimeter and threw down a left-handed dunk in the third quarter, Barrett (17 points) settled in late in the second half and played a game-high 39 minutes. Barrett started the game 1 for 6 but finished with a respectable 6-of-13 shooting line.\n\nRUI HIGHLIGHTS \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\u516b@rui_8mura with 12 points and 4 rebounds in 21 minutes in his preseason debut!#WizKnicks | #RepTheDistrict pic.twitter.com/7JcSKDoHX1 \u2014 Washington Wizards (@WashWizards) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s quiet for one, but he\u2019s a workhorse,\u201d Wizards all-star Bradley Beal said of Hachimura. \u201cHe\u2019s all about getting better. He\u2019s all about hooping and just playing basketball. That\u2019s all he wants to do. I actually like his demeanor. He\u2019s not too high, he\u2019s not too low. He\u2019s very even keel and he just goes out there and hoop at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nNo Wizard played more than 28 minutes, and Brooks limited Beal to 16 minutes. When the teams returned from halftime, Beal\u2019s work was done. He was busy holding his 1-year-old son, Deuce, when players stepped onto the court to start the third quarter. Beal finished with five points on 2-of-10 shooting and contributed four of the team\u2019s 26 assists.\n\nThe Wizards closed the game with a five-man lineup featuring several players on nonguaranteed deals. Phil Booth, who will likely play with the Capital City Go-Go of the G-League this season, made a runner with 9.8 seconds remaining to pull the Wizards within 101-99. Second-year center Moritz Wagner made the most of the late minutes. Wagner scored 11 through the fourth quarter and led the Wizards with 16 points.\n\nRead more:\n\nNBA under fire from all directions after response to Rockets-China incident\n\nThe NBA\u2019s China-Daryl Morey backlash, explained\n\nAt Wizards camp, a lot of talk about a \u2018new mind-set\u2019 and changing team\u2019s direction\n\nThe Wizards want more Thomas Bryants\n\nWizards drill down on the art of passing", "description": "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a lot of young players play this way,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said of the patience of Hachimura, who scored 12 points Monday night.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards.", "October At Am", "Candace Buckner Covers The Washington Wizards.
