Security officials stopped and searched pedestrians in the vicinity. Qasr Al Aini Bridge, the site of a pitched battle between demonstrators and riot police in 2011, was also closed.\n\nThe Sisi regime appeared to have been caught off guard last weekend when hundreds of protesters took to the streets in major towns and cities. Security forces responded with live fire and teargas. More than 2000 people have been detained since, including high-profile activists who don\u2019t appear to have had any involvement in the protests.\n\nOn Thursday the interior ministry made clear it intended to use force to quash any demonstrations on Friday.\n\nSisi, who came to power in a coup in 2013, has overseen a wholesale crackdown on freedom of speech and public dissent, considered by observers to be the worst in Egypt\u2019s modern history.\n\nHis expansion of a bloated security state has led to a rise in torture and police brutality that could constitute crimes against humanity, according to Human Rights Watch. An estimated 60,000 political prisoners languish in jail.\n\nOn Friday Sisi attempted to project an image of business as usual in a rare interaction with the public when he greeted a crowd gathered to welcome him at Cairo airport. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wake up on a Friday, it\u2019s not worth it. Don\u2019t worry about anything,\u201d said Sisi, as he returned from the UN general assembly in New York. \u201cWhat happened before will not happen again.\u201d\n\nPro-regime gatherings took place in Cairo\u2019s middle-class area of Nasser City and the northern port city of Alexandria.\n\nLast week\u2019s rare protests were sparked by a series of social media videos posted by Mohamed Ali, a former military contractor living in self-imposed exile in Barcelona who has called for a million Egyptian to march on Friday.\n\nAli has alleged that the Egyptian military squandered public funds to build palaces and luxury hotels, including opulent palaces for the president. Sisi later denied the claim, calling them \u201clies and slander\u201d. \u201cOf course I have built presidential palaces, and I will build presidential palaces,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they are not for me, they are for Egypt.\u201d\n\nThe loud wail of police sirens could be heard throughout Friday over Tahrir Square, a vital intersection in central Cairo that was the centre of protests that overthrew Hosni Mubarak in 2011, and the gathering point for demonstrations against the late former Islamist leader Mohamed Morsi in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAmnesty International called on world leaders to prevent a crackdown on demonstrators. The Franco-Egyptian Initiative for Rights and Freedoms published a letter to France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron, calling on his government to \u201cseriously consider its responsibilities concerning the use of French weapons against peaceful protesters\u201d.\n\nAli\u2019s corruption claims spoke to deep discontent among many Egyptians, living in a country where 32.5% of people live below the poverty line, according to the government\u2019s own estimates. Many have struggled to maintain their standard of living since the government began harsh austerity measures, dramatically raising everyday costs through cuts to vital subsidies on commodities such as fuel and electricity.\n\nWhile protests were expected in defiance of the state, a celebration entitled \u201cFor the Love of Egypt\u201d was scheduled to take place in Cairo\u2019s middle-class area of Nasr City, attended by Egyptian celebrities.\n\n\u201cMany Egyptians are understandably nervous about a new uprising. One must bear in mind that from the perspective of most Egyptians they have overthrown two governments since 2011 and for most of them their standard of living has deteriorated each time,\u201d said Timothy E Kaldas of the Washington thinktank the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.\n\n\u201cThat said, the popularity of Sisi and his government has been declining for years as people\u2019s standard of living has plummeted and the number of Egyptians in poverty has risen substantially.\u201d", "description": "Police seal off Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square before expected second weekend of demonstrations", "authors": ["Ruth Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9503b0f0557c42bd538079945aa036ecaadacbd8/0_191_3772_2264/master/3772.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54f8edde37275a668dfd62c0280f8f65", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
