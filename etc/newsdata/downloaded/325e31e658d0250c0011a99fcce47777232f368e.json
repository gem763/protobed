Cheers and chants broke out when she joined the picket line while holding a \u201cUAW on strike\u201d sign.\n\nShe condemned the automaker for making \u201cbillions of dollars in profits\u201d even as it closes U.S. plants. \u201cGM is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or to the people of America; their only loyalty is to their own bottom line,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIf they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on the planet, they will do it.\u201d\n\nA strong turnout by organized labor will be key for Democrats as they seek to defeat President Donald Trump in crucial swing states in the rust belt such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. These states were supposed to ensure Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory in 2016 but all went for Trump, at least in part thanks to support from some union members, who had traditionally been solidly aligned with the Democrats.\n\n\u2018War\u2019 On Labor\n\nBiden joined a group in front of a GM facility in Kansas City, Kansas. Wearing a red UAW shirt, he stood on the back of a pickup truck and addressed hundreds of striking workers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a war on labor\u2019s house for a long, long time,\u201d Biden said. \u201cCorporations bought back over a trillion dollars in their own stock.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president, who has a long history of support from labor unions during his political career, received a warm welcome from the workers, many of whom stayed to pose for pictures and get autographs after he finished speaking.\n\n\u201cThis is simply wrong and I know it\u2019s easy for me to stand up here and say \u2018keep at it,\u2019 because I\u2019m not making the sacrifice you\u2019re making,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in a position where I am out here and I am losing wages and I only have about 250 bucks to get me by. I\u2019m not in that position. But I tell you, the American people, we owe you. We owe you for this effort.\u201d\n\nSalary Demands\n\nAbout 46,000 GM workers walked off the job Sept. 15 after their contact expired. The strikers are asking for concessions from the carmaker including higher salaries, more jobs and a narrower pay gap between new hires and longtime employees.\n\nThe strike is the first against GM in 12 years and could cost the carmaker about $50 million a day in earnings before interest and taxes, according to an estimate by Credit Suisse. S&P Global Ratings last week said GM could lose production of 45,000 vehicles and burn through $1 billion of cash in the first week. The automaker may be able to make up some of that output later.\n\nBoth candidates scheduled trips to the carmaker\u2019s plants nationwide after striking workers criticized Democratic hopefuls for being absent from the picket lines.\n\n\u201cThis is the time that we find out who people are,\u201d Warren told UAW workers. \u201cWe find out who stands with workers,\u201d she added, after hugging and taking pictures with people on the ground.\n\n\u2018She Cares\u2019\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s here, that\u2019s all that matters and we got her back,\u201d said Joe Ryan, 59, who has been working at the Detroit-Hamtramck plan for 40 years. \u201cThat somebody of that caliber would be interested in coming not only to support us but walk in the picket line, that shows us that she cares about working-class people.\u201d\n\nWarren has brought union power to the forefront of her presidential campaign, vowing to bring in a union leader as labor secretary and promising that a union representative would be present at trade negotiations. Prior to joining the picket line, she privately met with UAW members.\n\nBefore Sunday, only two major Democratic candidates -- Tim Ryan and Amy Klobuchar -- had joined the GM picketers. Senator Bernie Sanders will visit Detroit on Wednesday.\n\nRyan, a congressman whose Ohio district was battered by job losses when GM idled its Lordstown plant, has been tweeting from union halls and factories across Ohio and Michigan since Monday. Klobuchar, a Minnesota senator, took coffee and doughnuts to striking workers at the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant on Thursday.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren joined striking United Auto Workers members on a picket line on Sunday as they compete for the support of a critical voting bloc in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.Warren was mobbed as soon as she arrived at General Motors\u2019 Detroit-Hamtramck", "authors": ["Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou", "Tyler Pager"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
