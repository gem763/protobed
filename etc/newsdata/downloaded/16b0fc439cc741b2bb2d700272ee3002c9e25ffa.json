Photo: Joan Marcus\n\nWill Arbery\u2019s Heroes of the Fourth Turning is so frighteningly well written, it\u2019s hard to write about. It\u2019s the rare play where standing and picking up your shit and shuffling down steps and going outside\u2014especially onto 42nd Street\u2014immediately after feels like a kind of violence. You\u2019re not ready for it yet. You\u2019re still in Arbery\u2019s world \u2014 murky yet lit by lightning, lyrical and scary, brave and terribly gentle. Coming out of the whole thing is like waking to a bucket of water thrown in your face. But even that jolt feels right in its way, because Heroes is a kind of nightmare. Arbery, whose thrillingly destabilizing Plano got a much deserved extended run at the Connelly in April, is a virtuoso of dream language and logic. He\u2019s an unostentatious surrealist\u2014a Magritte, not a Dali\u2014rigorous and playful and full of love for his subjects, even when, as in Heroes, those subjects are themselves fraught with confusion, aggression, and fearful, fearsome indoctrination.\n\nPerhaps trying to get out ahead of a prickly response from progressive New York audiences, the dramaturgical materials that surround the play and the artistic director\u2019s program note emphatically do not ask us to empathize with Arbery\u2019s characters. Instead, we\u2019re asked to consider, critically, the empathizing impulse. \u201cOh don\u2019t with the empathy,\u201d snaps one of those characters, Teresa, a ravening idealogue in a chic white jumpsuit. \u201cLiberals are empathy addicts. Empathy empathy empathy. Empathy is empty.\u201d Teresa (Zo\u00eb Winters), like everyone in Heroes, is a zealous Catholic conservative. One might, sans empathy, call her rabid. She\u2019s back in Wyoming\u2014where she attended the small, intensely intellectual and intensely faith-based Transfiguration College\u2014to celebrate the appointment of a beloved professor, Gina Presson (Michele Pawk), to the school\u2019s presidency. Arbery\u2019s play takes place in the wee hours, after all the toasts have been drunk, when anyone with their shit together has already gone home. But Teresa\u2019s still hanging around in Justin\u2019s (Jeb Kreager) backyard, along with Emily (Julia McDermott), Dr. Presson\u2019s daughter, who speaks with a lilt and walks with a cane, doubled over in pain from what seems to be Lyme disease; and Kevin (John Zdrojeski), who\u2019s full of whiskey and terror, and whose brain is short-circuiting from twenty-eight years of sexless self-loathing.\n\nAs they await their mentor\u2019s arrival, the quartet of former students does what you do when you\u2019re the last ones at the party, what intellectual misfits and social stragglers have done with free time and alcohol ever since Chekhov and surely long before, too: philosophize. Arbery prefaces his play with two definitions for the word \u201cfugue\u201d: first, a musical composition that passes a theme amongst a number of voices; second, the psychological phenomenon \u2014 \u201ca period of loss of awareness of one\u2019s identity, often coupled with flight from one\u2019s usual environment.\u201d Heroes plays gorgeously on both meanings, braiding together Jeb\u2019s staunch, taciturn bass with Emily\u2019s fluttering soprano, Kevin\u2019s bleating, staccato tenor with Teresa\u2019s belting, prestissimo alto \u2014 and building towards a wild, dissociative climax that makes the play feel like one of those horror theme park rides where you\u2019re stuck in an elevator plummeting towards the ground. There\u2019s a real (or surreal) fugue state coming in Heroes, but there\u2019s also the softer, more expansive sense that a night like this\u2014where people stand around in a haze of drink and ideas in a town that used to be theirs but isn\u2019t anymore\u2014creates its own kind of blurring of identities: who we were with who we used to be with who we\u2019re still, despite everything, aspiring and failing to be.\n\nPerhaps it shouldn\u2019t be so incredibly bracing (it certainly shouldn\u2019t be so unusual) to encounter a play with characters as fully formed, as fleshy and knowable, as Arbery\u2019s \u2014 but it is. The sneaky, simple brilliance of Heroes of the Fourth Turning is that it\u2019s not actually about its characters\u2019 talking points at all. It\u2019s about them. It\u2019s not shouting; it\u2019s listening. That\u2019s how it sidesteps the empathy headache while remaining exquisitely humane. We may be horrified by Teresa\u2019s tirades against abortion, her withering disdain for \u201cweakness\u201d of any kind (especially in men), and her avid assurance that \u201cThere\u2019s a war coming,\u201d but the point is not for us to feel our way into her perspective. It\u2019s for us to see her \u2014 and Kevin, and Emily, and Justin. Arbery\u2019s characters are so specific\u2014and his ear for their particular pathologies, patterns, and pains so sharp\u2014that the production invigorates us theatrically even as it chills us with its chorus of arguments, phobias, and theories. It has us leaning forward from the first moment, doubly so because Isabella Byrd\u2019s lighting design is wonderfully dark. An asymmetrical cone of back porch light is all the characters have to work in \u2014 when they venture out into the reaches of Justin\u2019s backyard, they dissolve into shadow. Even in the light, you\u2019ve got to strain a little to see them. It\u2019s naturalism that\u2019s also something more: Darkness does surround these people, and their efforts to dig their heels in and hold onto what they\u2019ve been taught is the light only makes the shadows thicken. \u201cI feel like a disease, Dr. Presson,\u201d admits the untethered Kevin, drunk enough to swerve into dangerous territory, somehow both fundamentally innocent and blindly self-pitying in his confession. But if nothing else, honest about the darkness.\n\n\u201cHow did I become a virus?\u201d reads another epigraph to the play, taken from lyrics by the singer Anohni. \u201cHopelessness \u2014 I feel the hopelessness.\u201d Only a few blocks away, Jeremy O. Harris\u2019s Slave Play is using the very same language of infection to look through another lens on inherited wounds in the national psyche. In Heroes\u2014which puts the people we adamantly protest that we do not need another Washington Post expose about center stage\u2014Arbery works like both poet and scientist. Heroes seems to me to be deep in conversation with that model of doctor-writers, Chekhov, whose \u201cclinical humanity\u201d\u2014as the biologist and writer Siddhartha Mukherjee calls it\u2014Arbery has inherited. In a way, the play is a kind of darkly warped, contemporary American Cherry Orchard: It\u2019s a portrait of a dying species, a self-proclaimed intellectual and spiritual aristocracy flailing as their claim on the earth and their sense of self dissipate. There\u2019s no sympathy implied for these sufferers, no implication that theirs is a world worth saving, but there\u2019s a moment of moral silence in the face of their suffering all the same. There\u2019s also\u2014like Chekhov\u2019s breaking string\u2014a terrifying noise that sounds repeatedly during the play. Jeb says it\u2019s his generator misfiring, but it sounds like the gates of Hell opening up, and when it strikes, every character doubles over like devils in torment, hearing the sound of their own sad, poisoned souls.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Justin\u2019s Lady Macbeth\u2013like anxiety over a spot of blood on his porch where he skinned a deer; or Kevin\u2019s drunken certainty of his own spiritual rot; or Teresa\u2019s shock-and-awe offensive of Bannonite hatred meeting Brooklynite hipness; or Emily\u2019s crippling pain \u2014 Kevin is right: They are all sick. And the marvelous scene in which their patron saint finally arrives is a dizzying deep dive into why. Pawk\u2019s glowing Dr. Presson fancies herself an alma mater. She\u2019s country-club-coiffed, well-spoken and professional, but she\u2019s also prouder than anything of her eight C-sections \u2014 her commitment to giving \u201c[her] own body away to something higher\u201d and \u201cstaying open to as many [children] as God wants to give.\u201d She is, at once, benevolent and intelligent, and a builder of broken human beings. Her urbane, old-school sensibilities are affronted by what\u2019s become of Teresa\u2014who gets the same high from rageful rhetoric as she gets from cocaine\u2014but she herself is the commander, Teresa only the soldier. She is one of the well-meaning architects of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s war.\n\nAll five actors are ablaze in Dayna Taymor\u2019s swift, measured, deliciously tense production. The fearless Winters gives Teresa a Joan of Arc\u2019s zeal for all the most appalling ideas. Deep menace lurks in the square, outwardly gentlemanly mass of Kreager\u2019s Jeb (the gun that rides around in the back of his jeans throughout the play, raising the stakes at every moment through its sheer presence, is a brilliant inversion on the Chekhovian trope). McDermott\u2019s Emily combines tenderness with tenacity and sparks of electric anger as she hovers closer to empathy\u2014to its gifts and its dangers\u2014than any of her fellows. Pawk is exactly a mother you know, and whom you might love, and whose most cherished beliefs feel like the most awful violence, though all she preaches is love. (Arbery\u2019s parents taught at a Catholic college in Wyoming and held Republican rallies at their home while he was growing up.) And Zdrojeski\u2019s tall, collapsing frame is shot through with chaotic despair as Kevin.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a war coming, then why is Catholicism all about sex?\u201d he moans in the face of Teresa\u2019s avowal that they\u2014their whole generation\u2014are, by birth and fate, heroes. (She\u2019s taken her wild-eyed grandiosity from the book by Neil Howe and William Strauss that Arbery references in his title.) Kevin\u2019s howls of incel desperation aren\u2019t simply pitiful or funny: They\u2019re his way of putting a finger on the fact that he and his fellow \u201cheroes\u201d have built their lives on repression and sublimation. They have been taught, in the language of faith and love, how to fear and despise. They\u2019ve turned their shame at their own desires, their own eccentricities and weaknesses, inside-out to the point where it has become armor \u2014 no longer defensive but offensive, a kind of holy hubris. They are articulate, but their bodies and souls are screaming. And in Arbery\u2019s stunning play, even in the rush of articulation, we always feel the scream.\n\nThis is my final review as the full-time theater critic for New York Magazine and Vulture.com. I\u2019m sitting in an apartment in Cleveland, where tomorrow I\u2019ll begin directing a play \u2014 a hard, strange, sad, funny, scary, vexatious play, one that probably can\u2019t be solved. That I don\u2019t aspire to solve. An old play that fascinates and unsettles me, that I believe might have something to say about who we are, here, now, today.\n\nMy preoccupations as a director have, for the past two years, informed my criticism. I\u2019m interested in courage and cowardice, in how those manifest both in content and in form, both within the story of a given piece and within the network of decisions that lead to its final physical presentation. I\u2019m interested in what makes theater uniquely and inimitably itself \u2014 in what sets it apart from other media and keeps it from becoming, God save us, simply another form of \u201ccontent.\u201d I\u2019m interested in theater\u2019s distinctive access to realms beyond the veil \u2014 the other worlds that touch our own, be they framed in the discourse of psychology, the supernatural, or the divine. In an essay on Macbeth, the critic Harold Goddard wrote, \u201cBehind the visible world lies another world, immeasurably wider and deeper\u2026. As a face now reveals and now conceals the life behind it, so the visible world now hides this other world as does a wall, now opens on it as does a door.\u201d At its best, theater locates and accesses those doors, draws them like another Harold, with his purple crayon, in thin air.\n\nI\u2019m stepping away from full-time criticism to pursue more directing, but there\u2019s no disentangling the two pursuits for me now. The Los Angeles critic Sylvie Drake calls criticism \u201cdirecting backwards.\u201d That makes sense to me, but so does a definition that doesn\u2019t emphasize the idea of criticism as, necessarily, a kind of dismantling. It is that, but at its best, it builds too. Critic and director must both articulate a vision and relate it to the wider world. Both are uthors, whether or an argument or an event. Both must contextualize; both must reveal themselves in the work; both must dream the future of the form they love. I\u2019m off now to a different kind of dreaming.\n\nHeroes of the Fourth Turning is at Playwrights Horizons through October 27.\n\nThis is my final review as the full-time theater critic for New York Magazine and Vulture.com.
