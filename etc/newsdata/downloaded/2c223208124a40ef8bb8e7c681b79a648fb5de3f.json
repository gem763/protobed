Underneath the inscription, the Mint placed the historic date the UK is supposed to leave the EU: 31 October 2019.\n\nTreasury officials refused to say whether the Mint will release the coins into circulation or seek to realise their inflated value by selling them on its website.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThe chancellor could decide to melt them down to be remade with a new date but officials are unlikely to risk going ahead until parliament and the EU give further clarity.\n\nJavid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond, had planned a limited edition of about 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for \u00a310 each in time for the first deadline on 29 March.\n\nThe 50p move is the Treasury\u2019s second U-turn in 24 hours after it confirmed that it had pulled a budget due to be held on 6 November, when the government would have detailed its economic plans and tax and spending priorities.", "description": "About 1,000 already-minted coins with \u201831 October 2019\u2019 leave date could be worth up to \u00a3800 each", "authors": ["Phillip Inman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f79f3f630f35e3f40420b138099f7b93b7e07f12/267_102_3469_2081/master/3469.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fbefaf0b050eac6c38334f6da294ca63", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
