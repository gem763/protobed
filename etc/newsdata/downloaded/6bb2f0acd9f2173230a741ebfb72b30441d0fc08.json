We are finding hens and cockerels being abandoned more frequently.\n\n\u2018Cockerels can be difficult to keep as they can be extremely noisy and will crow early in the morning. Some new owners simply aren\u2019t aware of how loud they can be and may be forced to find them a new home if their neighbours complain.\u2019\n\nAround 500,000 domestic fowl are kept as pets in the UK. Many health conscious families avoid buying eggs and instead keep chickens in a more \u2018ethical\u2019 environment at home.\n\nThe British Hen Welfare Trust told The Daily Telegraph it had rehomed 740,000 birds since 2005.\n\nA spokesman added: \u2018We receive a high number of calls from people looking to rehome their cockerels.\u2019", "description": "Many new owners don't realise what they are letting themselves in for - and end up abandoning them, the RSPCA has warned.", "authors": ["Xantha Leatham For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/00/20157932-0-image-a-30_1571959117433.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
