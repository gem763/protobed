That's smaller than any home crowd in the last five full seasons.\n\nIf you search CBC Ottawa's web archives for \"Ottawa Senators attendance,\" you'll find stories warning of trouble going back to November 2013, the season after Daniel Alfredsson chose to sign with Detroit, when average attendance was dropping to the high 17,000s.\n\nThe issue has since become much worse, and we've done more stories since then.\n\nHere are four graphs that illustrate the team's declining attendance.\n\nPer-game attendance since 2004-05 lockout\n\nRed represents a year Ottawa made the playoffs.
