The main objective is to give the intended audience the information they need. But this can also be done in a way that is creative and entertaining. The success of any presentation ultimately lies in how well you communicate facts and ideas. However, good design can make a big difference, helping a project or application to really stand out and making everything easier to understand.\n\nIn the case of an architectural design presentation, millions of dollars may hinge on the outcome. Potential clients expect to be impressed and they will be paying close attention to the overall appearance of the presentation and the details.\n\n3D modelling can make your school projects look really cool; here's a sneak peek of how to it works\n\nUsing 3D models can give you an advantage \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t require any modelling software. It is an easy-to-use method allowing you to give a more complete view of all the design elements involved. Let\u2019s start by doing one here!\n\nStep 1 : Create a new file\n\nInstall Powerpoint 365 (online version) or Powerpoint 2016 on your computer. Then select \u201cNew\u201d file from a template you like to work with.\n\nSelect \u201cNew\u201d file.\n\nCreate a new file with the template selected.\n\nSave your new file on to your computer with a new file name.\n\nStep 2 : Insert your 3D model (or find a free one to insert)\n\nDelete the default text boxes.\n\nSelect \u201cInsert\u201d from the top menu bar.\n\nGo to \u201c3D Models\u201d on the sub-menu bar and select \u201cFrom a file\u201d.\n\nGo to the directory where your own model is saved and press \u201cinsert\u201d. You will see a list of acceptable formats for 3D models here, such as .stl/ .3mf/ .obj. etc.\n\nYour model will be inserted and fitted into the page.\n\nIf you do not have a 3D model or simply want to spice up your slides with a rotating globe, you can still make use of some free 3D models available online. Microsoft provides a number of these 3D resources. This is how you can do it:\n\nCreate a new slide.\n\nClick \u201cFrom Online Sources\u201d under the \u201c3D model\u201d sub-menu.\n\nYou will find a list of the available online 3D models. Some of these models are animated. Pick one that suits you best.\n\nSelect the one you need and press \u201cInsert\u201d.\n\nStep 3: Resizing and adjusting the model\n\nIf your model needs adjusting, put your cursor over the central white icon of \u201corbit\u201d and drag your mouse to orbit your 3D model.\n\nYou may also want to resize the model as it appears by dragging the white dots along the outline.\n\nWhen you are done, add a description or title for your model.\n\nThat\u2019s it! By following those steps your presentation can be improved with 3D models. If you have some other great ideas on how to put these techniques to good use, you are welcome to email your PowerPoint to info.support@myarchischool.org. We will select a few creative examples and post them on our websites for the world to see!\n\nEdited by John Cremer\n\n(Disclaimer: Neither My Archischool nor our staff have any commercial relationship in any form with Microsoft or their authorised dealers.)\n\nMy ArchiSchool is an education institute that introduces the skills and knowledge needed to explore a career in architecture.
