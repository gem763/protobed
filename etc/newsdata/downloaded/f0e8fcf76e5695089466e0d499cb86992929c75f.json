However, he remained restrained.\n\nEric Whittaker begged corrective services officer for help before his death, calls reveal Read more\n\nMembers of Whittaker\u2019s family, whose names are protected by a non-publication order, also addressed the court.\n\n\u201cWhen I first walked in, I saw him with the shackles on,\u201d one family member told the court. \u201cI told the nurses, he is dead. Why can\u2019t you take them off? They looked at me like I was stupid.\u201d\n\nAfter Whittaker was sedated and reviewed by nurses, a brain scan was performed at 2.25 pm but, the court heard, it was six hours before the results were seen by a neurologist.\n\nEarlier this week another neurologist, Dr David Rosen, told the court time is crucial when dealing with brain injuries.\n\n\u201cEvery minute is a minute you will never get back,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cIf Mr Whitaker was taken to a clinic earlier, he may have been able to give a better account of his medical history, and may have had a better outcome.\u201d\n\nIn a statement read by the counsel assisting the coroner, Peggy Dwyer, Whittaker\u2019s family said: \u201cA great injustice has occurred while he was in custody. His basic human rights have been violated. We only wish to have his dignity back.\u201d\n\nWhittaker\u2019s death prompted Corrective Services NSW to launch an internal investigation, after which new protocols for the care of inmate patients were implemented, the court heard. These new protocols require officers to listen to health professionals in regard to the level of restraint an inmate requires.\n\nBut Holdgate said no matter what the protocols are, \u201cit is always difficult to get a consensus on appropriate levels of restraint with the authorities\u201d.\n\nEarlier this week, the court heard several of the 20 harrowing emergency phone calls Whittaker made from his cell in Parklea prison, in the lead up to his death.\n\nIn the audio recordings played in court, Whittaker repeatedly told corrective services officer James Dobry, who was responsible for fielding emergency calls: \u201cOpen my door\u201d and \u201cI need help\u201d.\n\nOfficer Dobry told the court it did not occur to him at the time that Whittaker was having a medical emergency. When Whittaker continued to use the emergency call or \u201cknock up\u201d system to ask for help, Dobry said: \u201cYou have already been seen by the night rovers.\u201d\n\nWestern Australia rolls out lifesaving hotline to address Indigenous deaths in custody Read more\n\nOn Monday, corrective services investigator Kenneth Johnston said Dobry\u2019s responses suggested \u201ca level of apathy towards the inmate\u201d.\n\nDobry told the court: \u201cIn hindsight, I could have been clearer about demanding a welfare check. Or taking Mr Whittaker straight to the clinic. The behaviour he was exhibiting was serious enough to demand a second welfare check.\u201d\n\nIn her closing statement Dwyer said \u201cno-one should be shackled in those circumstances, especially if the family is saying this hurts us\u201d.\n\nOn closing the inquest, Coroner Teresa O\u2019Sullivan addressed the family, saying \u201cwe will adjourn, and we will get to work\u201d.\n\nHer findings will be handed down on 28 February 2020.\n\n", "description": "The NSW coroner hears that Aboriginal prisoner Eric Whittaker was unconscious and would not have been able to move", "authors": ["Miles Herbert"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cadfa3046204c1f5bc2ac8ae544417b7d75f2ecc/0_10_950_570/master/950.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9810b0b1cbe40d191df6e76705b383a6", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
