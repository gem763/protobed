The Texans have won four of their past five meetings against Indianapolis.\n\nThe Jaguars will get a chance to exhale with Ramsey finally gone following a drawn-out divorce with Jacksonville that ended with a trade to the Los Angeles Rams last week. The Titans, meanwhile, will try to give their offense a jolt by starting Tannehill in favor of struggling Marcus Mariota.\n\nIn other early games on Sunday, San Francisco has a chance to get off to the franchise\u2019s first 6-0 start since 1990 when the 49ers play in Washington. Minnesota\u2019s revived offense heads to Detroit to take on the Lions while Buffalo hosts Miami with a shot at improving to 5-1.\n\nThe late window includes former Seahawks safety Earl Thomas visiting Seattle as a member of the Baltimore Ravens. New Orleans will try to stay unbeaten with Teddy Bridgewater at quarterback when the Saints visit Chicago.
