REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nHowever, he faces fresh challenges after some of the biggest student demonstrations in decades erupted last month opposing new bills parliament had tried to push through that critics say undermine democracy and threaten basic freedoms.\n\nHere some key policy issues facing the president:\n\nECONOMIC SLOWDOWN\n\nHampered by soft commodity prices, Indonesia has struggled to lift economic growth above 5% in recent years despite a boom in infrastructure building and attempts to cut red tape hampering investment.\n\nIndonesia has attracted investment in mineral smelting, but has failed to win as much of the manufacturing investment moving out of China compared with some rivals.\n\nWidodo has pledged to improve the investment climate further by relaxing strict labor rules, opening up more areas to foreign investors and speeding up trade agreements.\n\nBut the stakes are high given 2019 economic growth is expected to slow for the first time in four years amid risks of global recession.\n\nCORRUPTION\n\nStudent protests may persist amid anger over a law that they say weakens the war on graft and other controversial new bills, including a criminal code that outlaws sex outside marriage.\n\nAhead of his inauguration, Widodo approved parliament\u2019s bill to put the Corruption Eradication Commission under the watch of a new committee and curb its freedom to wiretap suspects.Last week, over 40 economists signed an open letter urging Widodo to revoke the law, arguing corruption hurts efficiency and hampers investment.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nIn a country where about half the population is under 30, students consistently rank near the bottom of international student surveys.\n\nThe president has allocated money for skills training for the unemployed and expanded a program to pay for higher education for the poor.\n\nGovernment officials also say a ban on foreign ownership in the university sector will be lifted, but primary education, particularly in remote areas, remains under-resourced.\n\nPAPUA\n\nIndonesia\u2019s two easternmost provinces are among the country\u2019s poorest regions and have seen a spike in violence since August, triggered by racial slurs made against Papuan students on the main island of Java.\n\nDemands by some separatist groups for a new independence referendum have gained momentum during the unrest.\n\nSome Papuans see a 1969 vote to integrate the former Dutch colony with Indonesia, which was backed by the United Nations, as illegitimate.\n\nWidodo has said he is open to holding talks with separatist leaders to end the unrest, a departure from the stance of previous governments and some of his ministers.\n\nRISING CONSERVATISM AND RADICALISM\n\nIndonesia has the world\u2019s biggest Muslim population and is often seen as an example of how democracy and Islam can co-exist, but rising conservatism has fanned greater intolerance in a country with significant religious and ethnic minorities.\n\nAt the same time, Indonesia is grappling with a resurgence in Islamist militancy after a series of suicide bombings in the city of Surabaya last year and the recent stabbing of the country\u2019s chief security minister by a suspected militant.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nIndonesia recently suffered its worst forest fires since 2015 and as the world\u2019s biggest palm oil producer has been fighting a plan by the European Union to phase out using the oil as a transport fuel due to links to deforestation.\n\nWidodo announced plans in August to move the capital from the crowded, flood-prone city of Jakarta on Java island to the forested island of Borneo, triggering questions over how the plan would be financed and its environmental impact.", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo started his second five-year term on Sunday pledging faster infrastructure development and more investment opportunities to create jobs and growth in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442988857&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0A7", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
