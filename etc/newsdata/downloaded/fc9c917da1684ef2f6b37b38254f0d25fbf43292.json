This is because the high volume of water used in a delicate cycle, which is supposed to protect sensitive clothing from damage, actually \u2018plucks\u2019 away more fibres from the material.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They can act as concentrators of other toxic pollutants and act as a carrier of these nasty chemicals.\u201d\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Washing clothes on a delicate setting\u00a0is the worst of all cycles for the environment as it causes hundreds of thousands of extra microfibres to be released into the water system, scientists have warned.\u00a0 Although regular washing machine\u00a0cycles cause clothes to be pushed together more, they use less water than gentler cycles,\u00a0according to research by Newcastle University.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/08/15/washing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
