The system has been tied to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people.\n\nThe messages, which sources provided to Reuters, appear to be the first publicly known observations that MCAS behaved erratically during testing before the aircraft entered service. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2OZl4Ic)\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration ordered Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg to give an \"immediate\" explanation for the delay in turning over the \"concerning\" document which Boeing discovered some months ago.\n\nThe fresh discovery came days before Muilenburg, who was stripped of his chairman title by the board last week, is due to testify before Congress.\n\n\"These messages indicate that Boeing withheld damning information from the FAA, which is highly disturbing,\" Peter DeFazio, Chair of the U.S. House of Representatives transportation committee, wrote in a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Friday.\n\nThe FAA said it \"is reviewing this information to determine what action is appropriate.\"\n\nA person briefed on the matter said Boeing failed to turn over the documents to the FAA for four months and that the Justice Department is also in possession of the messages.\n\nBoeing said on Friday that Muilenburg had called FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to respond to the concerns raised in his letter and assured him that the company \"is taking every step possible to safely return the MAX to service.\"\n\nIt said it had produced the document containing a former Boeing employee's statements to the appropriate investigating authority earlier this year, and brought it to the attention of the Department of Transportation on Thursday.\n\nBoeing has been cooperating with the House of Representatives Transportation & Infrastructure Committee's probe into the 737 MAX and will continue to do so in investigations by U.S. authorities, the company said.\n\nBoeing turned the documents over to the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI in February, one source said.\n\nFederal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation's inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 MAX's certification. And the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee confirmed it will question Muilenburg at an Oct. 29 hearing, one day before a House of Representatives panel is scheduled to question him.\n\nThe 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since March, forcing more than 100 daily flight cancellations at large U.S operators of the aircraft such as Southwest Airlines Co and American Airlines, and eroding their profits.\n\nBoeing has said the grounding has already cost it at least $8 billion.\n\nIts shares fell 6.8% to close at $344.00, before edging up 1.4% after hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n'I BASICALLY LIED'\n\nForkner said in one text message, \"I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly).\" The other employee responded that \"it wasn't a lie, no one told us that was the case\" of an issue with MCAS.\n\nForkner responded soon after: \"Granted I suck at flying, but even this was egregious.\" At one point Forkner said \"there are still some real fundamental issues\" in the simulator.\n\nIn the exchange, Forkner said he was writing while \"drinking icy cold gray goose.\"\n\n\"If you read the whole chat, it is obvious that there was no 'lie,'\" Forkner's lawyer David Gerger said by email on Friday.\n\n\"The simulator was not reading right and had to be fixed to fly like the real plane. Mark's career \u2013 at Air Force, at FAA, and at Boeing \u2013 was about safety. And based on everything he knew, he absolutely thought this plane was safe.\"", "description": "A Boeing Co senior pilot said he might have unintentionally misled regulators, in a series of internal messages from 2016 that became public Friday, plunging the world's largest airplane maker into a fresh crisis.
