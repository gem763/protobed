His career stretched more than 30 years, bridging the generations between Jerry Cook and Richie Evans to our current drivers. He recorded achievements in this sport that are likely untouchable, and his legacy as a champion will endure. We will keep his wife Julie and his family and friends in our prayers.\u201d\n\nStefanik won the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour seven times during his career and twice took home the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East trophy. He is the winningest driver in the Modified Tour's history before retiring in 2014.\n\nStefanik began flying after his retirement, telling RaceDayCT that he's a \"thrill seeker.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one to sit on the porch and I do like a little bit of thrill,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cI\u2019m a little thrill seeker. \u2026 I can\u2019t wipe the smile off my face every time I go fly that thing. I call it a flying lawn chair. But it\u2019s actually a pretty cool little airplane.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances behind the crash are yet to be reported.\n\nStefanik is among the drivers who are nominated for the 2020 NASCAR Hall of Fame.", "description": "Mike Stefanik, one of the most accomplished drivers in NASCAR history, died Sunday in a plane crash.
