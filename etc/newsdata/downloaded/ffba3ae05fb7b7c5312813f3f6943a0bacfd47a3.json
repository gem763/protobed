The Fed gave a hawkish cut of interest rates pushing the Fed fund rate down to a range between 1.75%-2.0%. The markets are still pricing in an additional 25-basis point cut in 2019, despite 3-dissents on the FOMC decision. The Fed cut mainly because global economic conditions are weak, and uncertain continues to weigh on growth given the continued US-Chinese trade war. US home sales rose to a 1.5-year high, but that failed to increase US yields.\n\nTrade gold with FXTM\n\n[fx-broker slug=fxtm]\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nGold prices edged higher rebounding ahead of support near the 50-day moving average at 1,481, and recapturing the 10-day moving average at 1,496. Additional support on the yellow metal is seen near the 50-day moving average at 1,481. Short term momentum has turned positive as the fast stochastic generated a crossover buy signal in oversold territory. The movements of the fast stochastic represent a flag pattern which is a pause that could refresh. Currently the fast stochastic is printing a reading of 21, which is slightly above the oversold trigger level of 20. Medium-term momentum is negative to neutral as the MACD histogram is printing in the red with a flat trajectory which points to consolidation.\n\nUS Home Sales Rose More than Expected\n\nThe National Association of Realtors reported that US home sales unexpectedly rose to a 17-month high in August as lower mortgage rates buoyed demand. Existing home sales increased 1.3% to an annual rate of 5.49 million units last month. July\u2019s sales pace was unchanged at 5.42 million units. Expectations were for existing home sales to decline by 0.4% to 5.37 million units. Existing home sales make up about 90 percent of US home sales.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The risks are for more geopolitics which could buoy gold", "authors": ["David Becker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/os8aXBEAuMWJhCUMR8rEJQ--~B/aD0zNTM7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/e47a4151077d3531f5a2f0136292af67", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
