Now we are visiting Chinese ODM companies to ask them to purchase our components.\"\n\nKorea's top four conglomerates -- Samsung, Hyundai, SK and LG -- are realigning their businesses to stay competitive amid a paradigm shift in global manufacturing. Chinese rivals who until quite recently made only cheap, low-quality products, have emerged as potent rivals, and the Koreans risk falling behind in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.\n\nHyundai plans to reduce its core business of car production by half and instead devote more resources to personal drones and robotics technologies, while SK and LG are trying to sell off unprofitable business and acquire other companies to respond to the rapidly changing business environment.\n\nIndustry watchers say the Korean manufacturing industry has come to crisis point unless it adjusts to the new global paradigm.", "description": "Samsung to Outsource Smartphone Manufacture to China", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
