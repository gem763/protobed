"London Fire Brigade had 'serious shortcomings' in response to Grenfell disaster", "language": "en", "text": "Fewer people would have died if key decisions had been made earlier (Picture: AFP)\n\nFewer people were likely to have died in the Grenfell Tower fire had residents been evacuated while it was still possible and \u2018serious shortcomings\u2019 not plagued the fire service\u2019s response, an official report into the tragedy said.\n\nThe public inquiry\u2019s first report into the blaze, due to be published on Wednesday but seen by the PA news agency, identified \u2018systemic\u2019 failures by the London Fire Brigade (LFB).\n\nIt also accused the brigade\u2019s commissioner Dany Cotton of \u2018remarkable insensitivity\u2019 after she said she would not have done anything differently on the night.\n\nInquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said fewer people may have died if key decisions had been made earlier, and made a number of recommendations following the two-year investigation into how the disaster at the west London tower block unfolded.\n\nIn the report, Sir Martin said the \u2018principal reason\u2019 the flames shot up the building at such speed was the combustible aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a \u2018source of fuel\u2019.\n\nThe 1,000-page report concluded the fire started as the result of an \u2018electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\nThe panels were added in the refurbishment of the tower before to the June, 2017 fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report also concluded the fire, in which 72 people died, started as the result of an \u2018electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer\u2019 in a fourth floor flat.\n\nSir Martin said Behailu Kebede, who had lived in the flat, bore no blame for the fire.\n\nSurvivors had previously urged the judge to make a point of formally exonerating the resident, who was offered police protection after false reports of his culpability circulated online.\n\nThe judge said he had not intended to investigate whether the building complied with regulations at this stage, but there was already \u2018compelling evidence\u2019 the external walls did not.\n\nInstead of adequately resisting the spread of fire, they \u2018actively promoted it\u2019, he said.\n\nDany Cotton was accused of \u2018remarkable insensitivity\u2019 after she said she would not have done anything differently on the night (Picture: PA)\n\nSir Martin also criticised the London Fire Brigade for its \u2018stay-put\u2019 strategy when residents were told to remain in their flats by firefighters and 999 operators for nearly two hours after the blaze broke out just before 1am.\n\nThe strategy was rescinded at 2.47am.\n\nSir Martin said: \u2018That decision could and should have been made between 1.30am and 1.50am and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities.\n\n\u2018The best part of an hour was lost before Assistant Commissioner Roe revoked the \u2018stay put\u2019 advice.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018I identify a number of serious shortcomings in the response of the LFB, both in the operation of the control room and on the incident ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It is right to recognise that those shortcomings were for the most part systemic in nature.\u2019\n\nSir Martin also said \u2018the LFB\u2019s preparation and planning for a fire such as that at Grenfell Tower was gravely inadequate.\u2019\n\nSir Martin criticised the London Fire Brigade for its \u2018stay-put\u2019 strategy (Picture: PA)\n\nHe praised the heroics and bravery of individual firefighters, but described the \u2018stay put\u2019 strategy as an \u2018article of faith within the LFB so powerful that to depart from it was to all intents and purposes unthinkable\u2019.\n\nAnd he said those giving advice to trapped residents during 999 calls were \u2018not aware of the danger of assuming that crews would always reach callers\u2019 \u2013 a key lesson from the Lakanal House fire in 2009, when six people died.\n\nSir Martin also took exception to Ms Cotton\u2019s evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the fire service on the night.\n\n\u2018Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped from their burning homes with their lives,\u2019 he said, \u2018the Commissioner\u2019s evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB on the night, even with the benefit of hindsight, only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire.\u2019\n\nSir Martin praised the heroics and bravery of individual firefighters (Picture: AFP)\n\nHe also said Ms Cotton\u2019s evidence \u2018betrayed an unwillingness to confront the fact that by 2017 the LFB knew (even if she personally did not) that there was a more than negligible risk of a serious fire in a high rise building with a cladding system\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Cotton announced her retirement in June.\n\nAn LFB spokeswoman said: \u2018The Inquiry\u2019s findings are not being published until Wednesday morning and it would be inappropriate for us to comment on them until then.\u2019\n\nAn inquiry spokeswoman said the chairman and whole team were \u2018dismayed and disappointed\u2019 that media had \u2018chosen to deprive those most affected by the fire \u2013 the bereaved, survivors and residents \u2013 the opportunity to read the report at their own pace and without the distraction of public discussion and commentary ahead of publication\u2019.\n\nThose given early sight of the report on Monday were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements to prevent it being leaked. It is not known whether these will now remain in place.\n\nShe added: \u2018The inquiry has no further comment to make at this time.\u2019\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s second phase is due to start in the new year.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
