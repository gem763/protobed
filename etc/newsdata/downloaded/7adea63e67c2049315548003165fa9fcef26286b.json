I would like to reassure you that we just want to be able to give the victims\u2019 families answers about what has happened.\n\n\"I can\u2019t begin to comprehend what some of you must be going through right now. You have my assurance that Essex Police will be working tirelessly to understand the whole picture to this absolute tragedy.\n\n\u201cI would also like to make an appeal to anyone living illegally in this country, who could help our investigation. Please come forward and speak to us without fear. I can assure you that your information will be received in strictest confidence and no criminal action will be taken against you.\"", "description": "Police in Belgium are reportedly hunting for a second lorry driver following numerous sightings of his truck at Zeebrugge port", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Pa", "Peter Powell", "Bbc", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723235.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bodies-found-in-lorry-container.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
