The new album was just released for the first time by Impulse! and Universal Music.\n\nThe only known film soundtrack scored by jazz legend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnColtrane?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JohnColtrane</a> was Gilles Groulx\u2019s classic of Quebecois cinema, THE CAT IN THE BAG. Previously hidden in plain sight, this score is now available to the world. What do these recordings represent in Coltrane's body of work? <a href=\"https://t.co/imp9WPh6ZX\">pic.twitter.com/imp9WPh6ZX</a> \u2014@thenfb\n\nThe music was recorded in 1964 as a soundtrack for Quebec filmmaker Gilles Groulx's first feature, Le chat dans le sac.\n\nSomehow, Groulx convinced Coltrane to score the film and he even managed to get legendary engineer Rudy Van Gelder on board to record the session at his famed New Jersey studio.\n\nThe record captures Coltrane at the height of his genius, and the personnel for the session features the saxophonist's classic group \u2014 McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass, and Elvin Jones on drums.\n\nThe new album includes the quartet stretching out on eight tracks, complete with alternate takes of five different compositions \u2014 which is part of what makes the album so special. As Savard explains, only 10 minutes of the music was included in the final cut of the film.\n\n\"[Groulx] left with the only master tape known in existence,\" Savard said.\n\n\"He came back to Montreal, edited the music into his film, and then the master tape, including the entire session, went back into the NFB archive and was there essentially collecting dust.\"\n\nFast forward to the early 2000s, and the forgotten recordings finally resurfaced during a research project that profiled Groulx's film.\n\nFrom there, Savard learned about the soundtrack, and his own passion project started.\n\nThe original tape box containing the master tape for the Blue World sessions, featuring handwritten notes by Gilles Groulx. (Universal)\n\nSavard says the film's original working title was Chronicle of a Break-up, which was the title that also appeared on the cataloguing for the soundtrack, complicating the search.\n\n\"So that's why it was a bit in limbo for all these years,\" he said.\n\nSavard, an avid record collector, couldn't believe it when he finally found the master recordings and learned that only a small fraction of the music was used for the film.\n\n\"It's always a fantasy to come across something that's rare,\" Savard said. \"But in this case, finding the unique copy of an unreleased Coltrane studio session master tape \u2014 it's something that's almost out of this world.\"\n\nTrue to its working title, the black and white film is about a romance that falls apart.\n\nThe film opens with the tender ballad Naima \u2014 a piece Coltrane named for his first wife and that was first heard on his colossal Giant Steps album.\n\nAs Naima plays, the viewer is introduced to two young Montrealers \u2014 an anglophone and a francophone.\n\n\"Essentially, the film chronicles the last days of their relationship,\" Savard said.\n\n\"But I think, for Gilles, it was also essentially a way to address some of the Quebec politics of the '60s and some of the concerns of the French Canadians at that time.\"\n\nSavard points out that the film falls ahead of the Quiet Revolution, and the fact that it addressed identity politics may have appealed to Coltrane, mirroring some of the similar issues unfolding in America.\n\n\"It's a bit of a romance film, but also a very political film at the same time,\" Savard said.\n\nThe new album includes unheard versions of Coltrane compositions like Naima and Traneing In. (The Associated Press)\n\nStill, Savard said it's still \"a bit of a mystery\" how Groulx convinced Coltrane to score the film.\n\nHe knows that Groulx shared a mutual friend with bassist Jimmy Garrison. But other than that connection between the musician and director, Savard says it's hard to know how the session ever came about.\n\nAt the time, jazz was the go-to sound for many directors. Other jazz heavyweights like Miles Davis and Charles Mingus had contributed their own soundtracks to films and Savard says that might have influenced Coltrane's decision too.\n\n\"We also know that Coltrane, at that time, his music was becoming a bit more politicized as well. He'd recorded a song called Liberia. He'd recorded a song Africa,\" Savard said.\n\n\"So it's possible that the politics in the film were appealing to Coltrane.\"\n\nAlthough none of the tracks on the album were original compositions penned specifically for the film, Savard says the recordings are one-of-a-kind and show Coltrane's growth as an artist as he works through his repertoire.\n\n\"These songs were in constant evolution,\" Savard said. \"But the fact that he went back to the studio to re-record this material is something quite unusual and something that he would rarely do.\"\n\nThis project was years in the making and Savard hopes the new album will finally give this music the audience it deserves, beyond the small circle of people who knew about it in Quebec.\n\n\"To me, it seemed a bit odd and a bit strange that this was only known in Quebec, Coltrane being such a pillar of jazz music,\" Savard said.\n\n\"It's something that I wanted to see corrected, essentially. I wanted these recordings to be recognized in film history and I wanted the recordings to be recognized in music history, as well.\"\n\nWritten by John McGill.
