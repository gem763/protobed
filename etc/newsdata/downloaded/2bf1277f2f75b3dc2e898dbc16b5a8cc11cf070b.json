Both did, former Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters told RT.\n\n\u201cOrwell and Huxley were always arguing about who had the closest view of what dystopia might look like in the future,\u201d said Waters, adding \u201cI think we got a lot of both.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the \u2018Big Brother\u2019 Orwellian dystopian nightmare, it happened two days ago in that magistrate\u2019s court,\u201d he explained, referring to a UK judge\u2019s decision on Monday to deny the WikiLeaks founder a delay in US extradition proceedings. Assange\u2019s lawyers have argued that they need more time to prepare a defense, and some of Assange\u2019s supporters have made the case that British law forbids extradition in the first place, if the charges can be seen as political.\n\nAlso on rt.com Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters: The US and UK are trying to KILL Julian Assange! (E808)\n\nThe world described by George Orwell in \u20181984\u2019 was one of mass surveillance and paranoia, where anyone could be snatched off the street by the state and made disappear for \u2018wrongthink\u2019. In \u2018Brave New World\u2019 Aldous Huxley, on the other hand, described a future where mass entertainment and the easy availability of pleasure-giving drugs made dissent virtually impossible.\n\n\u201cYou only have to look out in the street and see the people, the walking dead going by\u2026 and taking absolutely no notice of the fact that this journalist is being murdered by our government,\u201d Waters said, referring to the treatment of Assange in Belmarsh Prison, said by the UN to amount to torture.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018A 1950s show trial\u2019: John Pilger describes \u2018disgraceful\u2019 courtroom treatment of Julian Assange by UK judge\n\nTogether with veteran journalist John Pilger, the Pink Floyd frontman hosted a rally for Assange in front of the British Home Office in September, that went unreported by every single British newspaper.\n\n\u201cAnd we walk by with our earbuds in\u2026 clicking away on our iPhones as we walk unthinking, unfeeling, uncaring through our lives, and allow this bullshit to take place in our names, in our courts,\u201d Waters concluded.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
