He\u2019s probably busy cooking up something good about Mitt Romney\u2019s secret Twitter feed.\n\nThe bad news is that the Kurds left behind in northern Syria will shortly be fed into Erdogan\u2019s meat grinder unless Putin comes up with a way to restrain him in their summit tomorrow. The good news is that a few hundred U.S. troops will remain in parts of Syria to secure something more precious than human life \u2014 sweet, sweet oil:\n\nPresident Trump is leaning in favor of a new Pentagon plan to keep a small contingent of American troops in eastern Syria, perhaps numbering about 200, to combat the Islamic State and block the advance of Syrian government and Russian forces into the region\u2019s coveted oil fields, a senior administration official said on Sunday\u2026 The senior administration official said it was highly likely that troops would be kept along the Iraqi border area \u2014 away from the cease-fire zone that Vice President Mike Pence negotiated with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey last week. The main goal would be to prevent the Islamic State from re-establishing all or parts of its religious state, or caliphate, in Syria and neighboring Iraq. A side benefit would be helping the Kurds keep control of oil fields in the east, the official said.\n\nSo that\u2019s what he meant by those mysterious \u201cwe have secured the oil\u201d comments over the past few days. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s at least some comfort that Americans will remain in place to snuff out the ISIS brush fires that\u2019ll start now that the Kurds aren\u2019t around in the north.\n\nIt sounds like the Kurds won\u2019t let their hard feelings about the American pullout in the north stop them from continuing to partner with American troops in the east. They need those oil fields, after all, and it\u2019d be foolish to reject U.S. help out of pride at a moment when it\u2019s unclear how far Erdogan \u2014 or Assad, or Russia, or ISIS \u2014 might try to advance into Kurdish territory. Even a weak American commitment is worth something in deterrence, especially with Trump under pressure from his own party not to retreat further. If Kurdish forces rejected his offer of help in the east, it\u2019d be a perfect pretext for him to withdraw from Syria entirely:\n\nThe commander of the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazlum Kobani, whose fighters switched sides to join Syrian government forces after Mr. Trump announced the American withdrawal, said on Saturday that despite the Turkish offensive, his troops had resumed counterterrorism operations near Deir al-Zour. American officials widely interpreted the comments as a signal to Washington that the Syrian Kurds were still willing to fight in partnership with the United States against the Islamic State in eastern Syria, despite their abandonment in other parts of the country.\n\nA Kurdish official told the AP that Kurdish forces are complying with Trump\u2019s ceasefire with Erdogan by withdrawing from the buffer zone near the border. The issue for the Kurds isn\u2019t keeping their *troops* in place, it\u2019s keeping Kurdish *civilians* who live in the area in place. Military withdrawal is one thing, ethnic cleansing is another. The commander of Kurdish forces reportedly emphasized this to Lindsey Graham in a call on Friday:\n\nGeneral Mazloum is concerned about the cease-fire holding and was emphatic that he will never agree to the ethnic cleansing of Kurds that is being proposed in Ankara. (2/4) \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 18, 2019\n\nI hope we can find a win-win situation, but I share General Mazloum\u2019s concerns. I also told him that Congress will stay very involved and is extremely sympathetic to the plight of the Kurds. (4/4) \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 18, 2019\n\nAre we headed towards a proposal for international peacekeepers in the border buffer zone? The Kurds might agree to that. Trump certainly would agree to it, so long as those peacekeepers aren\u2019t American. Would Erdogan agree? How about Putin? Maybe Russian soldiers can walk the beat as Erdogan resettles millions of Syrian refugees in the area and ethnic tensions with the Kurds gradually begin to rise.", "description": "\u201cLike rats, America is running away.\u201d", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/k.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
