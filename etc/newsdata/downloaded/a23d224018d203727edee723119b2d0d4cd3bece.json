Reminder: There are 96 days until the Iowa caucuses and 370 days until the 2020 election.\n\nIs Tulsi Gabbard planning to run a third-party presidential campaign? And if she does, will it help President Trump win reelection?\n\nIn the never-ending cycle of Democratic angst over the 2020 election, those are today\u2019s leading worries.\n\nIn recent weeks the Hawaii congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate has appeared in far more headlines than her 1.9 percent national polling average would seem to merit. This is mostly because of her ability to attract and capitalize on controversy.\n\nIn a recent interview with former Barack Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, Hillary Clinton implied that Gabbard might be \u201ca Russian asset\u201d in that country\u2019s efforts to help President Trump. Gabbard, an Iraq veteran who has staked her campaign on her opposition to \u201cendless\u201d \u201cregime-change wars,\u201d responded by calling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nTheir spat led to several news cycles of speculation about some of the positions Gabbard has taken during her four terms in the House, including her demands that Obama use the term \u201cradical Islam,\u201d her advocacy for Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and her defense of Russian bombing campaigns in Syria. Gabbard retorted with tweets about the \u201cconcerted campaign to destroy my reputation\u201d being waged by Clinton and her \u201cproxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine.\u201d\n\nRep.

Citing an op-ed published by Gabbard in Wednesday\u2019s Wall Street Journal \u2014 and singling out a passage in which the congresswoman claims that \u201cwhether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name is on the ballot or not, her foreign policy will be, as many of the Democratic candidates adhere to her [hawkish] doctrine\u201d \u2014 Chait argues that Gabbard is now \u201cheavily hinting at a spoiler campaign to help Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cGabbard is saying right now that any Democratic nominee is going to be Hillary Clinton,\u201d Chait writes. \u201cWhat does that tell you about her intentions?\u201d\n\nChait probably goes too far here. Gabbard didn\u2019t write that \u201cany\u201d Democrat would be conduct foreign policy like Clinton; she said \u201cmany.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine her mounting a third-party campaign against, say, Bernie Sanders, who espouses similarly noninterventionist positions and for whom she resigned as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to endorse.\n\nBut what if Democrats don\u2019t nominate Sanders?\n\nChait is correct that Gabbard doesn\u2019t seem to be running to win the Democratic primary. In fact, much of her recent behavior seems consistent with some sort of effort to undermine it. She has declared that she will forgo another campaign for her congressional seat to avoid a tough race back home and focus exclusively on her White House bid, even though she barely registers in the presidential primary polls. She has accused the DNC of \u201chijack[ing] the entire election process\u201d and leading an \u201ceffort to rig the 2020 primary\u201d against her. She recently huddled at the restaurant of Trump adviser turned critic Anthony Scaramucci with Wall Street donors looking to stymie anticorporate candidates like Elizabeth Warren. And she has appeared frequently on Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and other Trump-friendly programs, often to criticize her fellow Democrats for running a \u201cvery, very partisan\u201d impeachment inquiry that could \u201ctear apart an already divided country.\u201d", "description": "Is Tulsi Gabbard planning to run a third-party presidential campaign?
