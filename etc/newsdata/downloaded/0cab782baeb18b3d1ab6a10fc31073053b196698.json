Here is how the coming weeks could pan out: Tomorrow of Friday: Boris Johnson holds talks with Leo Varadkar in Dublin. October 14: Parliament is due to return for the Queen's Speech. October 17-18: A crunch EU summit in Brussels, but Mr Johnson now seems certain to boycott the event in protest at the bloc's intransigence. October 19: If there is no Brexit deal by this date Remainer legislation obliges the PM to beg the EU for an extension to avoid No Deal. Jeremy Corbyn has said that he will only let Mr Johnson trigger an election after an extension has been secured. If there is a deal, it will start being rushed through Parliament immediately. October 31: The current deadline for the UK to leave the EU. November/December: An election looks inevitable.\n\nAnd in an interview in French newspaper Les Echos, Mr Juncker said it would be the UK's fault if Brexit turned sour.\n\n'If that's the case the explanation is actually in the British camp because the original sin is on the islands and not on the continent,' he said.\n\n'A no-deal Brexit would lead to a collapse of the United Kingdom and a weakening of growth on the continent.'\n\nDowning Street last night insisted that hopes of a deal were still alive. Mr Johnson held a 'constructive' 40-minute conversation with Irish premier Leo Varadkar and will meet him for further discussions in the next 48 hours, in what appears to be the last chance for securing a deal.\n\nBut ministers were gloomy, and the PM's official spokesman said negotiations were at a 'critical juncture'.\n\nGovernment sources said Mr Johnson could even boycott next week's crunch EU summit rather than suffer a ritual humiliation of the kind dealt out to Theresa May.\n\nThe collapse of the talks would put Mr Johnson on a collision course over whether he can keep his 'do or die' pledge to leave the EU by the end of this month.\n\nNo10 sources said if Brexit was delayed again by Parliament and the courts, the Tories would have 'no choice' but to fight an election on a No Deal ticket to prevent votes haemorrhaging to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.\n\nThe clash with Mrs Merkel came as a major setback to Mr Johnson, who believed he had an understanding with EU leaders that they would engage positively with his compromise proposals.\n\nThe PM had hoped that Europe's leading powerbroker would assist in breaking the deadlock, urging her to 'help get this boat off the rocks'.\n\nBut Mrs Merkel told him he would have to settle his differences with Brussels and Ireland.\n\nThe PM's spokesman said the two leaders had a 'frank exchange' \u2013 diplomatic code for a blazing row.\n\nMr Johnson is said to be furious that EU leaders have simply 'banked' his compromises \u2013 which include keeping Northern Ireland in the single market for goods \u2013 without offering any of their own.\n\nIrish foreign minister Simon Coveney said: 'I don't think things have reached an impasse but there are certainly significant gaps to close.'\n\nDowning Street accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured) of torpedoing a deal", "description": "Jean-Claude Juncker dismissed claims that the bloc will be to blame for failure to get an agreement, jibing that Britain had committed the 'original sin' of trying to leave.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/08/19479546-0-image-a-68_1570605609542.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
