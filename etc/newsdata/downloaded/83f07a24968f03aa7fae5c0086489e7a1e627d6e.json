If the ultrareliable Zuerlein had come through on his attempt from 44 yards out with 11 seconds to play, Los Angeles would have a long weekend to enjoy a bounce-back victory and a 4-1 start despite a multitude of issues.\n\nInstead, Zuerlein barely missed it wide right, leaving the Rams with three days off to think about falling to 3-2 and into third place in the NFC West with only their second losing streak during coach Sean McVay\u2019s tenure. The Rams aren\u2019t publicly worried about the long-term prognosis for their season, but consecutive losses to the Buccaneers and Seahawks have provided an early reality check they never received last year while starting 8-0.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a humbling last week,\u201d McVay said Friday. \u201cBut in this game, it\u2019s pretty incredible when you sit back and think about the amount of plays that occurred, and then for it to come down to one play, whether you\u2019re feeling pretty good or whether you\u2019re feeling like, \u2018Man, this is a little bit of a gut-check time for us.\u2019 That\u2019s why you just have to stay focused on the process, because sometimes those results can really change the approach, and I don\u2019t think ever one play can really define the way that you approach it, even though it could arguably be the difference between being 4-1 and 3-2.\u201d\n\nThe Rams responded to their first two-game skid under McVay late last year by winning four consecutive games, including two playoff contests, to reach the Super Bowl. Their relatively favorable upcoming schedule suggests they could reel off something similar - yet these Rams just haven\u2019t been as good as last season\u2019s team, even if they probably did enough to win in Seattle.\n\nBoth sides of the ball performed creditably against the Seahawks, who needed a variety of improbable plays - including Tyler Lockett\u2019s insanely difficult toe-tap TD catch , Tedric Thompson\u2019s remarkable one-handed interception and Russell Wilson\u2019s usual prestidigitation - just to force the Rams into that failed late drive for a winning field goal.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t get it done, but it was a really good game,\u201d Todd Gurley said. \u201cWe\u2019re always going to stick together, no matter the outcome. That\u2019s why I like this team.\u201d\n\nSo while the Rams won\u2019t feel awful about their performance, they also realize the NFC West won\u2019t be won as easily as it was the past two seasons in which the Rams lost only one division game in which they played their starters. They\u2019ll get a chance to do something about that next weekend when the currently unbeaten 49ers visit the Coliseum.\n\nBut the Rams\u2018 task got a bit tougher with the loss of linebacker Clay Matthews, who broke his jaw in the final minutes in Seattle when Chris Carson inadvertently kicked him.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe Rams\u2018 unimpressive offensive line appeared to improve a bit, keeping Jared Goff upright without a sack and clearing space in the rushing game for 4.6 yards per play when McVay deigned to use it. The line also was called for just two penalties - both on its veteran tackles, not the youngsters - in noisy Seattle after struggling with discipline in September.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nGurley has just one 100-yard rushing performance in the Rams\u2018 last 10 games - none this season - after doing it nine times in Los Angeles\u2018 previous 15 games. He ran effectively early against the Seahawks, but his 51-yard, two-touchdown effort on 15 carries was no difference-maker.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nTight end Gerald Everett had the type of performance expected from a second-round pick , making seven catches for a career-high 136 yards. Undrafted rookie Troy Reeder also made the most of a chance to start at middle linebacker in place of injured Bryce Hager, leading the Rams with 13 tackles.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nZuerlein has been one of the NFL\u2019s most reliable kickers ever since the Rams moved home to Los Angeles, but he has missed three field goals inside 50 yards this season - including this game-decider - after missing just four from inside 50 in the Rams\u2018 previous three LA seasons combined. Greg the Leg is still golden, but he suddenly seems mortal, too.\n\nINJURED\n\nBrandin Cooks is going through the concussion protocol, but the big-play receiver was asymptomatic on Friday, McVay said.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n6: Matthews\u2019 total sacks in his first five games for his hometown team. The veteran linebacker got the only sack by either team in Seattle, but he is out for several weeks after Carson\u2019s foot accidentally broke his jaw with 3:20 left. Samson Ebukam will take Matthews\u2019 place in the starting lineup, while Dante Fowler will be counted on to increase his pass-rushing acumen.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Rams will have extra rest and home-field advantage for an important divisional showdown with San Francisco next Sunday. A loss would knock Los Angeles down to .500 and put it in a deep hole in the divisional race, while a win would right the ship before a stretch with three straight games against struggling opponents.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Greg Zuerlein and the Los Angeles Rams missed a field goal and a redemptive victory by roughly the width of a football.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/rams_seahawks_football_32566_c0-188-4505-2814_s1770x1032.jpg?69a1fc6539b0afb563a7f592eea0c259c3cd4bcc", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
