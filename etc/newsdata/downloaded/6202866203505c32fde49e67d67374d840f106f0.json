Automakers are making that tougher originally appeared on abcnews.go.com\n\nStaying plugged in -- whether at the office, on vacation, or even in your vehicle -- has become the new normal, and carmakers may be helping to fuel Americans\u2019 addiction to their smartphones.\n\nVehicle voice recognition systems make it easy for drivers to respond to text messages and calls. In some cases, a driver's cellphone can be duplicated on the vehicle's screen, transforming the vehicle into a personal app library. The number of USB charging ports in a vehicle has even become a badge of honor for automakers (the more, the better).\n\nBut infotainment centers and voice technology -- developed in part to allow motorists to interact with their phones hands-free -- are now becoming a distraction, some experts say.\n\nLuxury carmaker Lexus not only added Android Auto to its 2020 RX sport-utility vehicle, but the company\u2019s designers also carved out a designated space near the center console to safely store smartphones. Lexus said its 2020 models deliver \u201ctechnology at the speed of life.\u201d\n\nChad Deschenes, Lexus\u2019 technical training senior analyst, said the company is giving customers what they want.\n\n\u201cPeople are connected to their device, it\u2019s just our current lifestyle,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, you\u2019ll have full connectivity inside the RX. The ultimate goal is for you to not have to touch your phone.\u201d\n\nPHOTO: Lexus' new RX SUV has a designated space near the center console to hold cellphones. (Lexus) More\n\nKarl Brauer, who oversees content strategy at Kelly Blue Book and Autotrader, said automakers are essentially integrating the phone experience \u201cwith the driving experience.\u201d\n\nThe technology can be efficient, he said: \u201cIf I am running late I can drive and talk and carry on a conversation without being stationary at my desk.\u201d\n\nBut there are drawbacks, too.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the systems don\u2019t always work,\u201d he noted. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s easier and quicker to grab the phone.\u201d\n\nBrauer pointed out that cellphone integration can offer a competitive advantage for an automaker when it\u2019s done right. Millennials are more likely to buy a vehicle based on a car\u2019s connectivity, he said.\n\n\u201cMillennials definitely consider things like mobile apps,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re over the age of 40 it\u2019s not such a big deal.\u201d\n\n(MORE: 'It's time for car companies to wake up': Women now the focus of the industry)\n\nNewer vehicles let drivers access Google Maps, Waze, Spotify, Apple Music, podcasts and audiobooks with a tap of the screen or voice command. Drivers can also decide to turn their vehicles into roving Wi-Fi hot spots.\n\nPHOTO: Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is presented at the CES electronics and consumer technology tradeshow in Las Vegas, Jan. 4, 2015.

Lexus even has a partnership with Amazon Alexa, allowing drivers to speak to the virtual assistant via the car.\n\nPHOTO: Lexus customers can remotely start their vehicle and request service maintenance via an app. (Lexus) More", "description": "Vehicle voice recognition systems make it easy for drivers to respond to text messages and calls.
