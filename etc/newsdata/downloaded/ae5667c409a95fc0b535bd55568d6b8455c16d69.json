Turkey is targeting the same Kurdish fighters, known as Syrian Democratic Forces, which it considers terrorists.\n\nWhat we know: Turkey's offensive in Syria\n\nTurkey had been reluctant to launch an attack there, fearing it would kill or wound U.S. forces. Without U.S. troops to shield the Kurds, Turkey launched its invasion. The lightly armed Kurds are no match for Turkey's warplanes, armor, artillery, troops and paramilitary forces.\n\nCLOSE Defense Secretary Mark Esper said it was an \"impulsive\" decision by Turkish President Erdogan to invade northern Syria and it will further destabilize the region and put America's Syrian Kurdish partners \"in harm's way\". (Oct. 11) AP, AP\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper blamed Turkey on Monday for the chaos that has prompted the U.S. withdrawal.\n\n\"Due to Turkey's irresponsible actions, the risk to U.S. forces in northeast Syria has reached an unacceptable level,\" Esper said in a statement. \"We are also at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict. Therefore, at the President's direction, the Department of Defense is executing a deliberate withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from northeast Syria.\"\n\nTrump threatens sanctions: Trump says he'll impose sanctions on Turkey 'soon,' as critics slam decision to withdrawal U.S. troops\n\nEarlier Monday, senior Army officials told reporters that the safety of U.S. troops in Syria prompted the decision to withdraw.\n\nMuch of Syria remains contested terrain among a variety of competitors including Bashar al-Assad's regime, his Russian backers, rebellious Syrians, ISIS militants and Kurdish forces that had been aligned with the United States.\n\n\u201cWe are working very closely with our partners to make sure the safety and security of their soldiers and of our soldiers is the top priority,\" said Gen. James McConville, the Army's chief of staff.\n\nThe primary threats to U.S. forces are Turkish-supported paramilitary forces and the potential for an accident in which Americans are targeted by mistake or caught between warring factions, according to the official who was not authorized to discuss such matters.\n\n\u201cIn Syria, the coalition continues to de-conflict military operations with Russia and regional forces to keep our troops safe, prevent unnecessary and unplanned military interactions, and de-escalate between forces when necessary,\" said Army Col. Myles Caggins, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS.\n\nThe U.S. wants to avoid bloodshed with Turkey, said Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. The United States operates a key air base in the country.\n\n\"We\u2019re trying to make sure we don\u2019t have a challenge with a NATO ally,\" McCarthy said.\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. troops is considered a boon for Assad and his patron, Russia, said Nicholas Heras, an expert on Syria at the Center for a New American Security. It will allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to have greater influence over events in Syria and the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\"Trump's decision on Syria, and the chaos that it has caused in the American and (Syrian Democratic Forces) camp, is a kingly gift from Trump to Putin,\" Heras said.\n\nTrump's decision has been viewed as a betrayal of an ally by some U.S. troops and lawmakers, including Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"Since day one, President Trump has bent to the will of autocrats,\" Reed said. \"He impulsively capitulated to Turkey\u2019s offensive without thinking about what comes next. Now, instead of telling Erdogan to stand down, President Trump is in full retreat. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/14/pentagon-withdraw-1-000-troops-syria-citing-risk-wider-war/3977619002/", "description": "The Pentagon will pull virtually all its troops from Syria as Turkey presses its invasion.
