Marriott Bonvoy members also enjoy a complimentary glass of prosecco, while Elite members will be treated to an additional point or credit bonus, and room upgrades.\n\nI spent a night in a King Room with City Views and would recommend it for the stunning views, as well as perks like a rooftop bar, and great location.\n\nNew York City is all about the hustle but the Flower District in between Chelsea and NoMad is a real respite. Wander its streets and encounter everything from towering Birds of Paradise and fiddle leaf figs to colorful orchids and apartment-friendly succulents. Not counting Central Park, it's perhaps the only place in the city where you'll find such abundant nature.\n\nHidden among the flora is the Moxy Chelsea, a relatively new hotel with a rooftop that transports you from elbowing people in the concrete jungle to glamping in a lush forest. It opened in February 2019 with 37 floors and three different types of rooms, drawing plenty of inspiration from the surrounding Flower District. Flora and botanicals are featured against exposed wood and plush fabrics. It's an efficient hotel, with streamlined rooms that almost force you to get out and take advantage of its various lounges and co-working spaces.\n\nThe Moxy Chelsea is part of the Marriott family so you can redeem and earn points during your stay. All guests receive a complimentary glass of prosecco at the second-floor or rooftop bar (I suggest the rooftop), and Elite members will be treated to an additional 500 points or $10 daily credit at the caf\u00e9 or bar, a room upgrade based on availability, and more. The Moxy brand has become quite popular in New York, with other properties in Times Square and the East Village.\n\nAs a native New Yorker, I don't think there's a bad time to visit the city (except maybe New Year's Eve), but if you're traveling during the busy holiday season, expect to pay a premium. Current rates in October start at $336 for a standard Double Room and $339 for a King Room with City Views (which I stayed in with a comped press rate). Once you get to November or December, rates can jump to $488 and $504 respectively.\n\nKeep reading to see why I was so impressed by the Moxy Chelsea.", "description": "The Moxy Chelsea brings NY's Flower District indoors and offers great views of the city.
