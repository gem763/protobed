The second and fourth graders also made the most of a dress-up station, suiting up like park rangers and backcountry firefighters. They also explained the symbolism of the National Park Service\u2019s logo to their two guests of honor from Washington D.C., the pool report noted.\n\nMore from WWD\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s NPS-supporting swing is meant to also raise awareness for the #EveryKidOutdoors program. Embracing the elements, FLOTUS floated down the Snake River with fourth graders Thursday afternoon. FLOTUS posted photos and video of her \u201cgreat first day\u201d on Twitter Friday morning. Dressed casually in a tan hooded down jacket, black turtleneck, pants and lace-up low-heeled boots, FLOTUS\u2019 ensemble accented the Boy Scouts\u2019 uniforms.\n\nFriday\u2019s roll call, so to speak, required a few tweaks. There was one change of plans. Contrary to Thursday\u2019s East Wing-authorized, rain-or-shine prediction, today\u2019s trip to Yellowstone National Park has been nixed, due to inclement weather, according to the pool report.\n\nBest of WWD\n\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter.
