Iowa\u2019s of course the first. And so that\u2019s where a lot of our focus is going to go.\u201d\n\nGrass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night. The Buttigieg campaign, which opened its bus tour to live-tweeting journalists in an effort to set itself apart, is also road-testing a somewhat novel approach to organizing. Its Iowa volunteers first contact friends and family members rather than cold-calling lists of registered voters, who are now so bombarded they ignore unknown numbers.", "description": "ENM NEWS - CLINTON, Iowa \u2014 On the day House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry of President Trump last week, Pete Buttigieg was being grilled by Iowa voters on", "authors": ["Jeff Edmonds", "Anne L Hilliard"], "top_image": "https://www.enmnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flush-with-cash-pete-buttigieg-bets-his-campaign-on-a-breakthrough-in-iowa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
