(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nGrassy hills where residents were promised bustling office buildings could now hold a massive warehouse. A small airport could be replaced with more than 500 townhouses. A church property could include housing for the elderly.\n\nEach of the projects is dependent on fast-track changes to existing zoning by the Prince George\u2019s County Council, which relies on bills called \u201ctext amendments\u201d to circumvent what lawmakers describe as an outdated and cumbersome zoning process.\n\nFor decades, text amendments have paved the way for some of the biggest projects in the Maryland suburb, including FedEx Field in Landover and MGM National Harbor in Oxon Hill. To date this year, 22 of 41 bills being considered by the council involve text amendments; they constituted 35 of 85 bills enacted by the council last year.\n\nBut residents are increasingly objecting, with the loudest outcry coming in response to a text amendment that would have allowed Amazon to build a 4 million-square-foot \u201cmerchandise logistics center\u201d in Westphalia, a subdivision in Upper Marlboro that was supposed to rival town centers in Reston, Va., or Columbia, Md.\n\nAmazon announced Aug. 23 that it was pulling back from the project, following opposition from residents and an appeal in court.\n\nHomeowners in Westphalia say they are thrilled by Amazon\u2019s decision but will continue to pressure the council to change the way it uses text amendments, which critics say can be shrouded in secrecy and rob the public of the chance to voice concerns.\n\n\u201cWe have to be really vigilant \u2014 a year from now, it could be another warehouse owner,\u201d said Briana Bostic, whose family bought a home in the neighborhood last year. \u201cThe bigger story is that this is a pattern.\u201d\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D), who has met with homeowners and the developers of Westphalia, said she was \u201cdeeply dissatisfied\u201d with the experience of Westphalia residents and shares their concerns about how the zoning process played out.\n\n\u201cA process that lacks public input does not benefit anybody,\u201d Alsobrooks said in a statement. \u201cI think that a process that allows adequate time for public comment in a transparent way not only benefits the community, but also businesses that come here.\u201d\n\nMacy Nelson, a land-use lawyer hired by the Westphalia residents, said other Maryland jurisdictions also use text amendments, but the Prince George\u2019s council has long \u201cled the pack.\u201d\n\nUnlike zoning-map amendment applications, text amendments do not include the names of applicants or properties that will be affected, or require staff reports, or analysis of the potential impact that zoning changes could have, including on schools or roads. Sometimes there is confusion, even among council members, about the affected properties. As a result, citizens rarely show up to public hearings on the amendments, often held on the same day as the council vote.\n\n\u201cIt is important to have consistency and certainty,\u201d said Stewart Schwartz, who heads the D.C.-based Coalition for Smarter Growth, noting that in other jurisdictions, a change as substantial as the proposed warehouse would likely have gone through full zoning review processes.\n\n(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).\n\n[These residents might have welcomed Amazon\u2019s HQ2. But they don\u2019t want its warehouse.]\n\nM.H. Jim Estepp, a former council member who now leads the Greater Prince George\u2019s Business Roundtable, said text amendments are important because the zoning process can be expensive and lengthy. A 2018 zoning update will not take effect for several years.\n\n\u201cNo one agrees on everything, but most people now would say they are thrilled with National Harbor,\u201d Estepp said. \u201cThat and other signature projects were made possible because of these tools.\u201d\n\nStaff at the Prince George\u2019s planning board, which sometimes reviews text amendments, have frequently opposed those that appear designed to make changes at specific properties.\n\n\u201cThis process defeats the entire purpose of zoning by preventing uniform application of objective development standards,\u201d read one letter last year by Legislative Coordinator Rana Hightower, about a bill sponsored by council member Mel Franklin (D-At Large) that would have allowed townhouses to be built in certain areas zoned rural-residential and did not initially have design standards.\n\nHightower wrote that townhouses were \u201cincompatible\u201d with the zone, and they would also be prohibited by the county\u2019s new zoning ordinance.\n\nFranklin, who at the time represented District 9, added design standards to the bill, which passed 8 to 1. Franklin said the bill related to a \u201cunique circumstance,\u201d but said he could not further discuss it because of a pending appeal.\n\nThe bill was one of several Franklin sponsored that allowed townhouses to be built on land where such a use had not previously been permitted, upsetting some residents who say they do not want suburban sprawl without a clear vision. One of the bills allowed smaller townhouses more closely together in mixed-use zones.\n\nFranklin said the current zoning ordinance \u201cdoes not sufficiently embrace residential density, which is why we have struggled to attract quality retail.\u201d\n\nDaniel Donohue, a farmer in Accokeek, said he has closely watched zoning changes and is \u201cvery concerned about the whole rural tier,\u201d and especially whether local roads can handle the new residents.\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t support it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAlaster Sampson, with dogs Bentley, left, and Toby, walks in the Westphalia neighborhood of Upper Marlboro last month.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nAlthough council members typically defer to the member whose district is affected by the project, some newly elected lawmakers, including Thomas E. Dernoga (D-District 1), Jolene Ivey (D-District 5) and Monique Anderson-Walker (D-District 8) have raised concerns about the text amendment process in committee hearings this year.\n\nDernoga, a lawyer who spent his early career fighting development projects and previously served two terms on the council, has abstained from voting on site-specific text amendments and vocally criticized the process for its lack of transparency.\n\nAfter Amazon announced its decision to pull back from the Westphalia project, Dernoga said in a statement that he congratulated \u201cthe residents who, against long odds, demonstrated the ability of positive civic engagement to protect their community from unplanned incompatible development.\u201d\n\n[Prince George\u2019s didn\u2019t make Amazon\u2019s list. But the county could still be a winner.]\n\nIvey, a former state delegate, said she only sponsors text amendments after she has heard from residents in the area that would be affected. In one case, she submitted a text amendment after speaking with members of First Baptist Church of Highland Park, which needed the change to build housing for seniors.\n\n\u201cWhat I think needs to be reformed is that we have so many cases where we need text amendments,\u201d Ivey said, adding that she is not yet confident that the zoning rewrite passed last year will address the issues. \u201cAnd there should be a formalized process for holding public hearings for these changes.\u201d\n\nCouncil member Dannielle M. Glaros (D-District 3), who chairs the planning, housing and economic development committee, said the council last year increased the interval between when zoning bills are presented and go to committee, allowing planning staff more time to analyze the impact of the bills.\n\n\u201cWe have just done an update to the process, but it is good to continually look at our legislative processes and consider if improvements are needed,\u201d Glaros said.\n\nCorryne Carter, who lives directly across the road from where the warehouse facility would have been built, said she received two letters from the Walton Development Group, the developer of Westphalia, informing her of possible changes at the property.\n\nBut she said the first official public meeting she heard about was a planning board hearing on June 27 \u2014 after the council had approved the legislative change.\n\n\n\nNew homes in the Parkside Westphalia development. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe amendment\u2019s lead sponsor was council member Derrick Leon Davis (D-District 6), whose district includes Westphalia. He declined an interview, citing the ongoing case.\n\nBut Davis has said in public hearings that he consulted with residents before introducing the amendments that would have paved the way for the warehouse, which he thought would be a catalyst for development.\n\nHe also said residents would have an opportunity to weigh in at a planning board hearing to review the \u201cdetailed site plan\u201d \u2014 which includes information about the size of the facility, the number of parking spaces and the appearance of the facility.\n\nAt that July 17 hearing, which lasted for nine hours, planning board chair Elizabeth M. \u201cBetty\u201d Hewlett said it was not the board\u2019s role to approve or disapprove the warehouse, since the law permitting its use was approved by the council 10 to 1 on June 18.\n\nHewlett said in an interview that the planning board is \u201cnot thrilled about text amendments that are site specific, but there are times when they are warranted,\u201d citing a bill this year to add urban farming as an approved use in a variety of zones.\n\n[Officials: Amazon exploring a massive logistics center in Prince George\u2019s County]\n\nCarter described it like this: \u201cIn the text amendment process, you\u2019re not being asked whether you want a car. You\u2019re being told that you\u2019re getting a car, and being asked what color you want it to be.\u201d\n\nShe and other Westphalia residents are working with residents in Bowie, about 15 miles north, who have been fighting a text amendment that would allow townhouses to be built on the site of tiny Freeway Airport. The Westphalia residents said they would continue to work with those fighting the Bowie project.\n\nThat amendment, also sponsored by Davis, was opposed by the planning board, which said it thought the bill \u201cwas drafted for a specific parcel.\u201d It has not yet been voted on by the full council.\n\nEric Afoakwah, a scientist who moved with his young family to a house across from the airport two years ago, said the area does not have the capacity for townhouses, citing already overcrowded schools and concerns about traffic in the area.\n\n\u201cI know about the dynamics of city life and needing housing,\u201d said Afoakwah, 37, who moved from downtown Silver Spring. \u201cBut it feels as though the county council is working for developers, not the residents.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nOfficials: Amazon exploring a massive logistics center in Prince George\u2019s County\n\n\u2018Prince George\u2019s Proud\u2019: Alsobrooks rallies residents in State of the County address\n\nMeet the members of the Prince George\u2019s County Council\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Prince George\u2019s County residents are pushing back against zoning text amendments.", "authors": ["Rachel Chason", "Reporter Covering Local Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kEAkj6sZb8N2PGicyNjyDRxXBgI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DRJV4GF6VQI6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg"}
