I don't understand why when something seems so simple to us.\"\n\nSacoolas' immunity is a complex issue \u2014 one that reached the highest levels of government in the U.K. and led Harry's parents all the way to the White House, where they say they were \"shocked\" when President Trump asked them to meet with Sacoolas who was in an adjoining room.\n\nThey declined that meeting, saying they would only meet with her in the U.K. and only in the presence of grief counselors. That still hasn't happened.\n\nThe family said it will accuse the administration of \"lawless misconduct\" and will also be seeking damages. CBS News reached out to Sacoolas' lawyers and is waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\n\n\nHomes on fire after plane crashes in New Jersey\n\nAlexander Vindman, first current White House official to testify in impeachment inquiry\n\nSinger Allison Moorer's memoir \"Blood,\" on the legacy of her parents' murder-suicide\n\n\n\n", "description": "Harry Dunn's family wants Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American official involved in the crash, back in the U.K.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QL.hh5oAs_JJ_M0biyrTUg--~B/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/097cc680f2323da24da9dc2f72b3607b", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
