That call is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfWhistleblowers walk among us. Now one has gotten in Trump\u2019s head.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfTrump seizes on Baghdadi raid to paint Democrats as dangerous leakers \u2014 and it\u2019s likely to inflame tensions amid a rancorous impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u25cfJohn Kelly says he warned Trump he\u2019d be impeached if he hired a \u2018yes man\u2019 as chief of staff to replace him.\n\n8:50 a.m.: Trump attacks Schiff, says he committed a \u2018criminal act\u2019\n\nTrump took renewed aim at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) on Monday, calling him a \u201ccorrupt politician\u201d and accusing him of having committed \u201ccriminal act\u201d during a congressional hearing last month.\n\nAD\n\nDuring an Intelligence Committee hearing, Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry, presented an embellished version of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. He later said it was meant as a parody, something that he said should have been apparent to Trump.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff went before Congress and Adam Schiff, what he did will never be forgotten: he made up a conversation,\u201d Trump told reporters at Joint Air Base Andrews as he prepared to head to Chicago. \u201cThey say he has immunity because he\u2019s a member of Congress. People shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do that. What he did, that\u2019s a criminal act.\u201d\n\nTrump also defended his decision not to brief Schiff about the military operation targeting Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of the Islamic State, before announcing his death publicly.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey were talking about why didn\u2019t I give the information to Adam Schiff and his committee, and the answer is, I think Adam Schiff is the biggest leaker in Washington,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a corrupt politician. He\u2019s a leaker like nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d\n\n8:20 a.m.: Trump heads to Chicago for law enforcement event, fundraisers\n\nAD\n\nAs House investigators seek to resume their work on Monday, Trump is heading to Chicago to address a conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and hold fundraisers.\n\nTrump left the White House at 8:17 a.m. and plans to return late in the afternoon. This is his first trip to Chicago since becoming president. He frequently blames the city\u2019s Democratic leadership for its relatively high crime rate.\n\nAD\n\n7:30 a.m.: RNC chairwoman calls impeachment inquiry a \u2018charade\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican allies resumed their attacks Monday on the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry, with Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel calling it a \u201ccharade\u201d in a morning tweet.\n\nEchoing other Republican attacks from recent weeks, McDaniel took issue with several aspects of the process, including the lack of a vote to launch the inquiry, which is not required by the Constitution.\n\nAD\n\nMcDaniel also accused Democrats of having \u201cno defined scope\u201d and \u201cno specific rules.\u201d\n\n\u201c#StopTheSchiffShow!\u201d she tweeted, referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\nAD\n\nStephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s former White House chief strategist, also attacked Schiff on Monday during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is much ado about nothing,\u201d said Bannon, who has launched a podcast to push back against the inquiry. \u201cThis is Schiff and a radical group of Democrats that are throwing the country into a constitutional crisis over the Christmas holidays. We\u2019re hurtling toward a constitutional crisis.\u201d\n\n7 a.m.: Despite subpoena, former White House national security adviser unlikely to testify on Capitol Hill\n\nKupperman, who served as a deputy to Bolton, is not expected to show up on Capitol Hill on Monday, despite a congressional subpoena and a warning from Democrats that a failure to appear could result in a contempt citation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, Kupperman filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to resolve conflicting orders from Congress and the White House over his testimony. Over the weekend, his lawyer Charles Cooper reiterated Kupperman\u2019s desire to have the courts resolve the dispute before he appears.\n\nHouse Democrats pushed back. On Saturday, three committee chairs sent Cooper a letter arguing the lawsuit lacked merit and had been coordinated with the White House. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) and acting Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) called Kupperman\u2019s suit \u201can obvious and desperate tactic by the president to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nCooper responded with a strong letter of his own Saturday night, saying the lawsuit had not been \u201ceven discussed\u201d with anyone at the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Tom Hamburger\n\n6:30 a.m.: Republican senators feel anxious and adrift defending Trump\n\nRepublican senators are lost and adrift as the impeachment inquiry enters its second month, navigating the grave threat to Trump largely in the dark, frustrated by the absence of a credible case to defend his conduct and anxious about the historic reckoning that likely awaits them.\n\nRecent days have delivered the most damaging testimony yet about Trump and his advisers commandeering Ukraine policy for the president\u2019s personal political goals, which his allies on Capitol Hill sought to undermine by storming the deposition room and condemning the inquiry as secretive and corrupt.\n\nAD\n\nThose theatrics belie the deepening unease many Republicans now say they feel \u2014 particularly those in the Senate who are dreading having to weigh their consciences against their political calculations in deciding whether to convict or acquit Trump should the Democratic-controlled House impeach the president.\n\nAD\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Robert Costa and Philip Rucker\n\n6 a.m.: Sen. Johnson, ally of Trump and Ukraine, surfaces in crucial episodes in the saga\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) met in July with a former Ukrainian diplomat who has circulated unproven claims that Ukrainian officials assisted Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, a previously unreported contact that underscores the GOP senator\u2019s involvement in the unfolding narrative that triggered the impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\nIn an interview this week, Andrii Telizhenko said he met with Johnson for at least 30 minutes on Capitol Hill and with Senate staff for five additional hours. He said discussions focused in part on \u201cthe DNC issue\u201d \u2014 a reference to his unsubstantiated claim that the Democratic National Committee worked with the Ukrainian government in 2016 to gather incriminating information about then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Telizhenko said he could not recall the date of the meeting, but a review of his Facebook page revealed a photo of him and Johnson posted on July 11.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was in Washington, and Sen. Johnson found out I was in D.C., and staff called me and wanted to do a meeting with me. So I reached out back and said, \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll come down the Hill and talk to you,\u2019 \u201d Telizhenko told The Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nAn individual close to Johnson confirmed that staff for one of his committees met with Telizhenko as part of an ongoing investigation into the FBI and its probes of the 2016 election, but declined to say whether the senator was involved.\n\nThe meeting points to Johnson\u2019s emerging role as the member of Congress most heavily involved in the Ukraine saga that has engulfed the White House and has threatened Trump with impeachment.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Elise Viebeck and Dalton Bennett\n\n5 a.m.: Chants of \u2018Lock him up\u2019 and \u2018Impeach Trump\u2019 greet the president at Nationals game\n\nTrump was booed during Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night when he made a rare public appearance in a luxury ballpark suite in \u00adDemocrat-dominated Washington.\n\nWhen the president was announced on the public address system after the third inning as part of a tribute to veterans, the crowd roared into sustained booing \u2014 hitting almost 100 decibels. Chants of \u201cLock him up\u201d and \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d then broke out at Nationals Park, where a sellout crowd was watching the game between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros.\n\nThe president appeared unmoved, waving to fans and soon moving to chat with House \u00adMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in his luxury box along the third base line.\n\nTrump, who has virtually never been seen in Washington outside the White House, his own hotel and a handful of other highly controlled settings, came with the first lady, a coterie of Republican members of Congress and top aides, who could be seen smiling, chatting and posing for selfies throughout the game. He entered without fanfare about eight minutes before first pitch, only spotted by a few in the crowd.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "Charles Kupperman, who served as a deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton, is seeking a ruling from a judge about whether he should testify to House committees.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jrL2eNMW5puTzYv_PAogpHXmkDU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LIRLBJXYZII6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
