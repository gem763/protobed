The 1977 team did it in Game 151, and the 2013 club clinched on Sept. 19.\n\nThough an Arizona loss to the New York Mets would have clinched it for the Dodgers, Los Angeles emphatically took care of business on its own. Seager homered with two on to cap a four-run first inning against Ty Blach (1-3) and added a two-run drive in the third for a 6-0 lead.\n\nGavin Lux hit his first career homer in the fifth to increase the Dodgers\u2019 NL record for long balls in a season to 258.\n\nBuehler (13-3) limited last-place Baltimore to four hits over seven shutout innings. He struck out 11.\n\nBREWERS 4, MARLINS 3\n\nMIAMI (AP) -Christian Yelich broke his right kneecap on a foul ball and will miss the rest of the regular season, an injury that overshadowed Milwaukee\u2019s win over Miami.\n\nThe Brewers didn\u2019t say whether the reigning NL MVP might be able to return for the playoffs that begin Oct. 1 if they make it that far. Yelich will return to Milwaukee on Wednesday for further evaluation.\n\nMilwaukee, which won its fifth in a row, closed within one game of the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild-card spot.\n\nYelich fouled a ball off his leg in the first inning. He was down on the ground for several minutes before limping off the field.\n\nPinch-hitter Tyler Austin lifted a tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the ninth inning. Yasmani Grandal led off with a single against Adam Conley (2-9), Grisham doubled and Austin put the Brewers ahead.\n\nJunior Guerra (9-5) got the win. Drew Pomeranz pitched a scoreless ninth for his first save.\n\nStarlin Castro homered for Miami.

Realmuto, Bryce Harper and Dickerson all homered in the first inning, Scott Kingery hit an inside-the-park homer and Dickerson tacked an insurance run with a solo shot late to help the Phillies win for the third time in four games.\n\nBlake Parker (3-2) pitched two scoreless innings of the relief for the win. Hector Neris worked a scoreless ninth for his 25th save.\n\nMax Fried (16-5) took the loss for Atlanta, which got run-scoring hits from Freddie Freeman, Dansby Swanson and Francisco Cervelli. Johan Camargo added a solo homer.\n\nTIGERS 12, YANKEES 11\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Jordy Mercer capped a comeback from a six-run deficit with a game-ending single off Chance Adams in the ninth inning, and Detroit overcame six home runs by New York.\n\nBrett Gardner and Didi Gregorius each homered twice, and Gleyber Torres and Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n also went deep for the Yankees, whose 276 homers tied Minnesota for the major league lead.\n\nNew York led 6-0 in the second inning. But the Tigers tied the score with six runs in the third, aided by an error by Torres at second base.\n\nGrayson Greiner doubled with one out in the ninth off Chance Adams (1-1) and Mercer\u2019s single to the gap in right-center scored pinch-runner Willi Castro.

An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez (8-8) was almost as sharp for the Nationals, finishing with four hits and one walk allowed, along with five strikeouts.\n\nThe American League Central-leading Twins took a five-game lead on Cleveland into the night. The Indians, who have six more losses than the Twins, played at the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Nationals entered 9\u00bd games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League East, but they were in the first wild card spot, 3\u00bd games above the cut, ahead of Milwaukee.

It was the first time the Athletics had been shut out since May 9.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the A\u2019s had a season-best 25 hits and built a 7-0 lead in the first inning without an extra-base knock. They still ended up tying a season high with six homers after not hitting any in their previous two games.\n\nHouston\u2019s Wade Miley (13-5) allowed seven hits and seven earned runs in a third of an inning.\n\nTanner Roark (4-1) worked 5 2/3 innings, allowing eight hits, five earned runs and a walk with three strikeouts.\n\nROCKIES 2, CARDINALS 1\n\nDENVER (AP) - Nolan Arenado hit a 482-foot two-homer that bounced out of Coors Field in the first inning, Chi Chi Gonz\u00e1lez got his first big league win in four years and Colorado slowed St. Louis\u2019 playoff push.\n\nSt. Louis, which had won 23 of 30 coming in, maintained a four-game lead in the NL Central over the second-place Chicago Cubs.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez (1-6) allowed one run and four hits in six innings.
