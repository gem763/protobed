This portion of the weekend is not a 20/20 Presidential Justice Center event.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Harris tweeted that the California senator \"will now participate in Mayor Benjamin\u2019s forum at Benedict today.\"\n\nHarris had faced some pushback over her initial decision to skip the event, which is being attended by all the major Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenKey witness in impeachment investigation asks federal judge to rule on testifying Pompeo voices support for work of diplomat criticized by Trump Biden, Sanders defend themselves over questions of age MORE, Sen.

South Carolina and our HBCU [historically black college or university] students deserve a champion and leader unafraid to be challenged and checked - tomorrow will provide them with that much-deserved opportunity.\u201d\n\nHarris in her statement Friday said she was backing out of the event because she refused to be complicit in \u201cpandering\u201d to the president\u2019s record on racial issues.\n\nShe noted that she is \"the only candidate who attended an HBCU,\" adding, \"I know the importance that these spaces hold for young Black Americans.\"\n\n\u201cToday, when it became clear Donald Trump Donald John TrumpKey witness in impeachment investigation asks federal judge to rule on testifying Pompeo voices support for work of diplomat criticized by Trump Biden, Sanders defend themselves over questions of age MORE would receive an award after decades of celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent Black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures and racist behavior that puts people\u2019s lives at risk ... I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the forum, Harris touted a litany of her plans to promote criminal justice reform, including legalizing marijuana and reducing incarceration, and said the First Step Act, which Trump signed into law and was honored for, was a good first step but must lead to the \"second through 10th steps.\"\n\nTrump's appearance at the college Friday came days after he faced bipartisan criticism for comparing House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching.\u201d\n\nUpdated: 2:20 p.m.", "description": "Democratic candidate says she will attend the event after a sponsoring group that gave Trump an award were removed from the gathering", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/harriskamalatwo_10152019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
