In every prior occasion for a presidential impeachment inquiry there has been a vote of the House,\" said a senior administration official, speaking as the letter was released.\n\nThe letter said Trump has been denied basic due process rights, such as to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses to testify, receive transcripts of testimony, and have access to evidence.\n\n\"All of this violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent,\" the letter said.\n\nIt said the Supreme Court has recognised that due process protections apply to all congressional investigations.\n\nThe letter was the result of an intense behind-the-scenes effort in recent days by White House lawyers to respond to the Democrats' impeachment bid.\n\nOne concern the White House has involves the whistleblower. House Democrats are working to protect the identity of the person who has accused Trump of impropriety in his dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\"There shouldn't be a situation where you can have a primary witness, an accuser in an impeachment inquiry, and the president never able to know who the accuser is and never able to cross examine him,\" said the senior administration official.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has called the inquiry a partisan \"witch hunt\", and released a summary transcript of his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a bid at damage control.\n\nThe letter argues - a contention denied by the Democrats - that the impeachment effort is simply aimed at reversing the result of the 2016 presidential election and influencing the 2020 election.\n\n\"The decision as to who will be elected president in 2020 should rest with the people of the United States, exactly where the Constitution places it,\" said the letter.\n\nLoading\n\nReuters", "description": "Its letter says US President Donald Trump has been denied basic due process rights, such as to cross-examine witnesses and have access to evidence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7479%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_58%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d28757229ebe41f762ba6d3365859c1e89b712fd", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
