Beyond the Castle-like \u201cvibe of the thing\u201d, it\u2019s important to examine the actual material benefits China enjoys from its status and the damage it is inflicting on our two countries and the rest of the developed world.\n\nWhen China joined the WTO in 2001 it designated itself as a developing country but agreed to conditions of entry much tougher than those available to other developing nations. For example, China needed to cut its average industrial tariff only from 42.7 per cent to 31.4 per cent, but instead agreed to reduce it to 9.5 per cent. As a developing country, China was obliged to cut its agricultural tariff from 54 per cent to 37.9 per cent, but dropped it to 15.1 per cent.\n\nIn some areas, China did more than most developed countries, eliminating all agricultural export subsidies - which the US and the European Union had deployed to corrupt world agricultural markets during the 1980s, at great cost to Australian farmers - on accession to the WTO. Only in 2015 did the US, the EU and other WTO members agree to eliminate these subsidies.\n\nWhile Trump has accused China of \u201ccheating the system\u201d by maintaining its developing-country status, he has imposed tariffs not only on China but also on the EU, South Korea, India and a host of other countries, in clear contravention of the WTO\u2019s rules. His pretence is that his tariffs are WTO-compliant because they fit into a little-used national-security exemption provided in the rules for cases where a member country might be under threat of invasion. How does Trump explain his decision on national security grounds to apply tariffs on imported washing machines? Could it have anything to do with US washing-machine manufacturer, Whirlpool, being located in Michigan, a Democratic state that flipped in the 2016 US election to help deliver him the presidency?", "description": "Donald Trump is wrong: China isn't the only country cheating on trade.
