I\u2019m fed up of talking about penalties we should have had. Arsenal on Monday and now. That\u2019s a penalty 101 times out of 100.\n\n\u201cToday was [about] the decision of the referee. We could have sat there smiling,\u201d Solskjaer added. \u201cThere are many games we could and should have won away from home. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue today. It\u2019s a good away point. In a group, if you get a point away, win all your home games, you go through.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

And it was, in that way, as predictable as United\u2019s display. There is no contentious penalty call that can excuse the absence of creativity, no hope to be taken from the lack of imagination, nor any positive spin to be put on the grim sequence of results that this side is putting together.\n\nFor the second time in a week, Solskjaer was left bemoaning a refereeing decision that could have transformed a draw which reflected the balance of play into a narrow and largely undeserved win. United did not do nearly enough to beat AZ, just as they did not do enough to beat Arsenal three days earlier. That is the issue, rather than any refereeing decision.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

United have the seventh-best expected goals value in the Premier League this season. Take penalties out of the equation and they have the third-worst. They have scored spot-kicks in two of their three victories this season. A penalty sent them on their way against Chelsea and proved decisive against Leicester. Only Astana \u2013 currently the third-best in Kazakhstan \u2013 have been beaten exclusively by goals from open play.\n\nAnd an inability to create chances stretches further back than August. United have now failed to score more than one goal in 19 of their last 22 games. The wait for an away win pre-dates Solskjaer\u2019s permanent appointment. It is, in fact, their longest run without victory on the road since 1989. Solskjaer believes it will end soon, perhaps against second-bottom Newcastle United at St James\u2019 Park on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI do feel [the win] is going to come,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point me talking about it. I\u2019ll get your questions until we do win. If we don\u2019t we\u2019ll get this on Sunday as well.\u201d Solskjaer denied that the problem is anything psychological. \u201cWe are a team that can be set up well to play away from home. Sometimes you can play on the counter. Today we didnt really get the counter-attacks as we wanted to.\u201d\n\nBut what his insistence on a counter-attacking approach fails to recognise is that most teams do not attack Manchester United, precisely because they are Manchester United. Many are still wary of what their opponents represent, United are often favourites to win home and away, regardless of form. Few teams want to give up the space that Solskjaer\u2019s system requires. AZ were well organised. Newcastle are unlikely to be any different.\n\nThe supporters who applauded Solskjaer at the final whistle and chanted anti-Glazer songs at the final whistle in Den Haag appreciate the bigger picture. The manager is powerless when it comes to many of the problems facing the club. He is responsible for much of the on-pitch matters, however. More goals have to be scored, more chances must be created and performances have to improve if Solskjaer is to avoid blame entirely.", "description": "Even though Manchester United\u2019s winless run away from home had stretched to its tenth game and its 212th day, and even though he is still waiting for a first victory on the road since taking permanent charge, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer declared himself \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the efforts of his players after their goalless Europa League draw with AZ Alkmaar in Den Haag on Thursday", "authors": ["Mark Critchley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/10/Manchester-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
