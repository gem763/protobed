Illinois reported seven more cases on Tuesday, bringing the nationwide total to at least 116.\n\nDoctors across the US are being told to look out for any similar cases (Picture: Getty)\n\nSymptoms include coughing up blood, blood in the urine, severe bloody noses, bleeding gums and internal bleeding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCDC\u2019s alert says outside Illinois, emergency rooms in Indiana, Missouri, Wisconsin and Maryland have treated affected patients since March 10.\n\nDad 'cracked baby's skull after mother fed her cocaine-laced breastmilk'\n\nIllnesses have been linked to fake marijuana before but this is the first outbreak involving rat poison contamination, said the CDC\u2019s Renee Funk. Those sickened require hospitalization and treatment with vitamin K to control bleeding, she said.\n\n\u2018This is an unusual outbreak,\u2019 Funk said Tuesday, adding that is unclear how the contamination occurred.\n\nFake marijuana, also called synthetic cannabinoids, contains man-made chemicals that produce a high similar to marijuana. It is sold in smoke shops and other stores as liquids that can be used in e-cigarettes or in dried plant material that can be smoked. Nicknames include K2, Spice and Kush.\n\nThe outbreak started in March but people are still being admitted to hospitals (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018The number of cases continues to go up each day,\u2019 Melaney Arnold, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Public Health, said Tuesday. \u2018Synthetic cannabinoids in general are not safe and this is one example of not knowing what chemicals are in the product. We are telling people don\u2019t use synthetic cannabinoids.\u2019\n\nGirl, 15, killed herself after being kidnapped and sold to sex traffickers\n\nThe federal government and many states have banned some of these products or specific ingredients, but the CDC says manufacturers skirt these laws by creating new products or labeling them \u2018not for human consumption.\u2019\n\nTests on fake pot bought at a Chicago convenience store by undercover agents detected the rat poison ingredient, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said in a news release. Three store employees were arrested and face federal drug charges.\n\nIllnesses from fake marijuana have increased in recent years; a CDC report noted at least 456 cases between 2010 and 2015.
