All 189 people on board died.\n\nThe official crash report, released by Indonesia last week, gives a definitive timeline of what happened on the doomed flight.\n\nIt shows that the pilots tried more than 20 times to stop the plane's computer forcing its nose down. But they could not bring it under control, and the plane crashed into the sea at 450mph.\n\nThis is the full timeline of the fatal flight, according to investigators.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nLion Air flight JT 610 took off from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at 6.20 a.m. on October 29, 2018. Less than 13 minutes later it smashed into the sea, killing everyone on board.\n\nIt was the first of two fatal crashes for Boeing's 737 Max. A second crashed over Ethiopia in March 2019, leading to the grounding of the plane, and plunging Boeing into an ongoing crisis.\n\nThe final report, released by investigators last week, pointed to flaws in Boeing's design of the plane, as well as mistakes by the airline and its staff.\n\nThe timeline it outlines shows the crew wrestling to control the plane as automatic anti-stall software, known as MCAS, overrode their instructions and pushed the nose down more than 20 times. It crashed into the Java Sea at around 450mph.\n\nHere is what happened on board:", "description": "Documents released by Indonesia in late October have given a definitive picture of what happened on board the plane as it entered its fatal descent.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cfa1bd611e205251c699934?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
