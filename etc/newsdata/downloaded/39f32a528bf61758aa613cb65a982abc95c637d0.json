When they tried to get more information, answers were often not forthcoming.\n\nOne option was community resource centers, places run by the utility where affected residents were supposed to be able to cool off and charge their phones. But they often got little information or assistance there because PG&E had not adequately staffed the centers, a senior state official with knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMeanwhile, state agencies, in charge of services like railways and the water supply, were forced to open the state\u2019s emergency operations center, which is normally used for actual disasters like earthquakes and fires, the official said. The center was running at Level 2, the same level it operated on during the Ridgecrest earthquake over the summer. And the local authorities were forced to bear the cost of additional staffing, including overtime hours for police officers, to deal with the shutdown.\n\nThis was a big moment for PG&E, which does not have extensive experience using what California officials refer to as a \u201cpublic safety power shut-off.\u201d Its previous wildfire shut-offs had been limited to tens of thousands of customers \u2014 and it was ill prepared for the task.\n\nMs. Malashenko, deputy executive director for safety and enforcement at the California Public Utilities Commission, arrived at 9 a.m. on Tuesday for the first of her two 12-hour shifts at PG&E\u2019s operations center. She said she was stunned by what she saw. PG&E\u2019s website crashed just ahead of the first rounds of power shut-offs that would leave thousands in the dark.\n\nIn addition, the systems the company uses to alert residents and businesses that they would lose power didn\u2019t work as they were supposed to, Mr. Johnson, the chief executive, later acknowledged.", "description": "As the utility turned off power to millions of Californians, its website went down and it struggled to communicate with local officials and inform residents.", "authors": ["Ivan Penn"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/12/business/12utility3/merlin_162453453_602aaec6-09e8-484f-b8bd-70441192de5a-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
