Police investigators worked with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services on the accusation.\n\nAccording to documents sent to HuffPost from NCDHHS, the three employees who worked at the Danby House allegedly encouraged the residents in its \u201cSpecial Care Unit\u201d to physically fight one another. The employees also egged the residents on while filming the incidents. One of the workers also forcefully shoved a resident.\n\nWinston-Salem Police Department Tonacia Yvonne Tyson, Taneshia Deshawn Jordan and Marilyn Latish McKey\n\nIn one incident, two residents with dementia, referred to as Resident 8 and Resident 9 in documents, began fighting in Resident 8\u2019s room as three health care workers \u2014 identified by authorities as Tyson, McKey and Jordan \u2014watched and recorded it on a phone.\n\nDuring the fight, the residents fell on the bed, and Resident 9 continued to hit Resident 8. In a cell phone video obtained by authorities, Resident 8 is heard yelling, \u201cLet go, help me, help me, let go\u201d as the staff members continue to record the fight without intervening, say the documents. At one point, a staff member tells Resident 8 to \u201cStop screaming, (expletive).\u201d Resident 9 continues to hit Resident 8 and begins to choke her. A staff member can be heard encouraging Resident 9, saying \u201cpunch her in the face.\u201d While Resident 8 was being choked, a staff member can be heard in the background saying, \u201cYou making her turn red,\u201d the documents say.\n\nAccording to the documents, the video shows one of the employees calling for their supervisor to come into the room. Once off the bed, Resident 9 was still instigating Resident 8, and in retaliation, Resident 8 tries to shove Resident 9 out of the room, but the staff tells her, \u201cDon\u2019t you push her.\u201d When the supervisor finally arrives, she comes into the room smiling, and does not ask about the fight. Instead, she points a finger at Resident 8 and says, \u201cStop, you better sit down and stop, go to bed,\u201d say the documents.\n\nOne of the workers, who is not specifically identified in the documents, told authorities she recorded the fight because Resident 8 was a \u201cPain in the butt.\u201d\n\nOn a separate occasion, Resident 8 pushed another resident, identified in the document as Resident 10, to the ground. Documents say Tyson, McKey and Jordan were present for that incident as well, and one of them yelled at Resident 8, pushed her forcefully into a room, shut off the lights and told her to go to sleep. The three workers left Resident 10 on the floor until Resident 8 had been pushed into the room The worker who shoved Resident 8 was not specified in the documents.\n\nDanby House\u2019s parent company, Affinity Living, LLC, told Winston-Salem Journal in a statement that it has \u201ca zero tolerance policy for mistreatment\u201d and that \u201cMcKey, Tyson, and Jordan were terminated immediately in June when community management was alerted to this situation.\u201d The company said it has implemented additional staff training and \u201ca more rigorous vetting process for all new and existing employees.\u201d\n\nAffinity Living did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAccording to the Winston-Salem Police Department, a magistrate gave Jordan a $1,500 unsecured bond and McKey a $1,000 unsecured bond. Tyson was released from custody on a written promise to appear in court.\n\nThe women are scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 14.", "description": "\u201cPunch her in the face,\u201d one suspect apparently said, according to the documents.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da646c7200000ba0c50460c.jpeg?cache=ptpce7j1km&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
