However, thousands massed outside the venue to chant slogans.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pro-democracy protesters outside the stadium where Carrie Lam held her first community dialogue, where thousands massed to chant slogans.

Another said police had been left to deal with an issue that can only be solved politically.\n\nOthers called for universal suffrage. Currently the chief executive is chosen by a pro-Beijing committee and only half the city\u2019s lawmakers are directly elected.\n\n\u201cYou say you want to listen to the people, but the people have been voicing their demands for three months,\u201d one male attendee said.\n\nOne speaker likened Hong Kong\u2019s condition to having cancer. \u201cAnd you want to heal the illness with a few painkillers,\u201d she said.\n\nOf the 30 people chosen to speak throughout the evening, 24 openly criticised the government, two made neutral comments and four expressed sympathy for Lam\u2019s administration.\n\nQuick guide What are the Hong Kong protests about? Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.\n\nProtesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong\n\nBut it is unclear what, if anything, Lam can offer. Both she and Beijing have ruled out any further concessions to protesters, whose five demands include an independent inquiry into police conduct, an amnesty for more than 1,500 people arrested and fully free elections.\n\nOn Wednesday, a top Chinese envoy in the city described those demands as \u201cpolitical blackmail\u201d, raising concerns that Lam has been given little wiggle room to de-escalate simmering public anger towards her administration and the police.\n\nThroughout her appearance on Thursday Lam resisted making concrete commitments beyond continuing to listen to people and holding more town halls.\n\nNo drones, drinking or dissent: China lays down law ahead of 70th anniversary Read more\n\nPolice maintained a low presence near the venue but local media said 3,000 officers were on standby in case of clashes.\n\nThis summer\u2019s unrest was ignited by a now-scrapped proposal to allow extraditions to the authoritarian mainland. But it has since snowballed into a wider movement pushing for democracy and police accountability after Beijing and Lam took a hard line.\n\nThe city is bracing itself for a fresh round of protests in coming days, with Saturday marking five years since the pro-democracy umbrella movement kicked off and Tuesday being the 70th anniversary of communist China\u2019s founding.", "description": "Openly critical audience call for independent inquiry into police brutality and handling of pro-democracy protests", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7403a01a3e77ac93059005b96d1c1f89eca01645/0_245_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11df531b36791005d79ab6bee2dc6f37", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
