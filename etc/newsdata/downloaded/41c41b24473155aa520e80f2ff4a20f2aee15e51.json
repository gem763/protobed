A large farm can\u2019t be without power for even an hour. Crops must be irrigated and harvested, animals watered, freezers and coolers kept cold and offices run. Tim Mueller, one of Riverdog\u2019s owners, had to rush to rent an expensive generator to power just the bare minimum of their business. The time and resources it takes to plan for a power outage adds a huge burden to an already full load.\n\nWe are thankful that PG&E is taking steps to prevent the wildfires that their power lines can cause. I\u2019d trade my farm in a heartbeat if it meant saving even one of the lives lost in last year\u2019s fires. But it is not sustainable to damage agriculture, one of California\u2019s most important yet most financially struggling industries, every time the wind blows. Farmers and rural communities rarely get more than lip service from business executives and politicians .\n\nSo what is the solution? I\u2019m not a utility expert, but I can tell you what a farmer hopes for.\n\nThe most obvious solution would be for PG&E to bury electrical lines in rural areas. This would keep power flowing to farmers no matter the weather, while reducing the risk of wildfires. Also, the California Public Utilities Commission needs to to be more than just a hand-slapping agency. Instead, it should force PG&E to update its electrical infrastructure, some of which was built in the 1900s.\n\nRight now there is no financial incentive for PG&E to reach out to the far corners of California and rebuild its electrical grid, because it is expensive and doing so would not increase their profits. When a fire burns everything down, California taxpayer dollars pay to bail out a private company that should be public.\n\nIt took two staggering years of wildfires, $30 billion in liability costs and huge power outages for the utilities commission, politicians and economists to even discuss making parts of PG&E publicly owned. Working-class farmers in California would like a utility provider that has our best interests at heart, not their investors\u2019 profits.", "description": "For many California farmers, it means potentially losing everything.", "authors": ["Carine Hines"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/opinion/24hines1/24hines1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
