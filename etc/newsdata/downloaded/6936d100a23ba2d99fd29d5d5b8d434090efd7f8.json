The 26-year-old accountant was unarmed, sitting in his living room watching television with a bowl of vanilla ice crea- when Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger, 31, burst in and began firing.\n\nSurely, I believed, Dallas police and county prosecutors would find a way to explain it all away. I expected a press conference, during which they would attempt to defend each and every one of Guyger\u2019s actions. They would call Jean\u2019s death an unfortunate tragedy and commit themselves to increased officer training. They would, I reasoned, find a way to somehow place the blame on an unarmed black man. If history is any guide, the off-duty officer was more likely to be placed on paid administrative leave and returned to the department after a cursory investigation than she was to face a jury of her peers.", "description": "The most damning part of the prosecution\u2019s case against Amber Guyger isn\u2019t that she shot an unarmed black man.
