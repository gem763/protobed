The Swedish singer-songwriter is blunt, not only about sex, drugs and female desire, but about her bad decisions and self-destructive thoughts. Even her coffee order is extreme. \u201cCan it be burning hot?\u201d she asks the waitress. \u201cI need it to burn.\u201d\n\nReclining on a sofa in a high-end London hotel, Lo has the look and presence of a Seventies rock star, tall and striking, wrapped in a black leather jacket, her hair dip-dyed blue. But the 31-year-old is also warm and amiable, far removed from the often blurry-eyed nihilism of her music videos, as if writing so many songs about her own fears and anxieties has proven therapeutic.\n\nIn 2014, Lo\u2019s drug-fuelled emotional breakdown bop \u201cHabits (Stay High)\u201d became a sleeper smash, cementing her status as an unflinchingly intimate storyteller of Gen-Y dysfunction. Hers is a propulsive, grungy sound, one that doesn\u2019t so much blare as sweat, conjuring images of sliding up against one too many bodies on the dancefloor. But in the five years since the release of \u201cHabits (Stay High)\u201d, she has found herself being handed a specific persona in the press: that of a wild and unpredictable exhibitionist.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cI always found it funny,\u201d she says now. \u201cIt started out like, \u2018You\u2019re this trashy party girl who is a bad influence \u2013 how does that feel?\u2019 And then I would always get these questions about being body positive, being open about my sexuality, open about drug use, all that stuff, and I\u2019m sitting there like, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll talk about that for two questions and then the rest would be about music\u2019, but the headline would always be \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve done drugs\u2019 or \u2018Yes, I like my body\u2019, or \u2018Yes, I\u2019m bisexual\u2019 or whatever. I\u2019ve just embraced it now. I wouldn\u2019t want to change my expression or get rid of those sides of myself just because I\u2019m frustrated with the narrative.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a narrative that changes from place to place, she says. If the US and UK press has been fixated on her graphic lyrics or penchant for onstage nudity, the rest of Europe has made a fuss about the occasional drug reference in her music. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in Sweden, all they ask me about is drugs because it\u2019s so very, very harsh there about drugs in general. All outlets take a stand against it. Which I\u2019m fine with \u2013 I think it\u2019s good to stand for something. They don\u2019t want the slightest risk that any young listeners think that it\u2019s cool to take drugs, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying, though. Ever. But I\u2019m also not lying, I\u2019m just talking about my life.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 30 best album covers - ranked 1/30 30) The Strokes \u2013 Is This It Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance \u2013 after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band\u2019s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He\u2019d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous \u201cass shot\u201d. The photograph, Lane later revealed in interviews, was taken in either late 1999 or 2000. His girlfriend had just got out of the shower, while he was playing with an old polaroid camera. He found a Chanel glove and asked her to pose. \u201cShooting on a Big Shot isn\u2019t easy: you can only shoot from a specific distance, and it\u2019s really designed for head-and-shoulders portraits,\u201d he explained to The Guardian. \u201cBut when she slid the glove on and bent forward, I knew it was the perfect shot \u2013 simple, straightforward, graphic and just so sexy.\u201d For fans, the image represents one of the last definable scenes in music. 2/30 29) The Notorious BIG \u2013 Ready to Die Biggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album\u2019s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact. 3/30 28) David Bowie \u2013 Aladdin Sane It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet; a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face. 4/30 27) Nas \u2013 Illmatic One of the greatest debut albums \u2013 and arguably the best hip hop record \u2013 of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch\u2019s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper\u2019s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas\u2019s entire world, \u201cuntil I educated myself to see there\u2019s more out there\u201d. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling. 5/30 26) Kate Bush \u2013 The Dreaming Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her \u201cshe\u2019s gone mad\u201d album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini\u2019s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist\u2019s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was \u2013 and still is \u2013 associated. 6/30 25) Oasis \u2013 Definitely Maybe Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned \u2013 Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead\u2019s house in Manchester. Jones didn\u2019t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead\u2019s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones\u2019s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. \u201cYeah, global dominance,\u201d he said. Soon after the album\u2019s release, that\u2019s exactly what happened. 7/30 24) Rolling Stones \u2013 Sticky Fingers Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger. 8/30 23) Miles Davis \u2013 Bitches Brew German painter Mati Klarwein \u2013 who also created Santana\u2019s artwork for Abraxas \u2013 was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis\u2019s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself; challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love. 9/30 22) AC/DC \u2013 Back in Black Back in Black\u2019s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, AC/DC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren\u2019t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history. 10/30 21) Blondie \u2013 Parallel Lines Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines\u2019 cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. \u201cI\u2019m not impressed,\u201d her stance seems to say. \u201cTry harder.\u201d 11/30 20) Bob Dylan \u2013 The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: \u201cHe wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.\u201d Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin\u2019 Time, also noted the cover\u2019s significance, how it \u201cinfluenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility\u201d. 12/30 19) Led Zeppelin \u2013 Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin couldn\u2019t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It\u2019s an easy tactic \u2013 using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music. 13/30 18) Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols \u201cThe album will last. The sleeve may not,\u201d said the adverts for the Sex Pistols\u2019 first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols. They\u2019d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word \u201cbollocks\u201d on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history. 14/30 17) The Roots \u2013 Things Fall Apart For a limited time, The Roots\u2019 Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world\u2019s \u201cgreatest turmoils\u201d. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot \u2013 a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers. \u201cThis became the main artwork for a few reasons,\u201d art director Kenny Gravillis told Complex magazine. \u201cThe cover felt like the urban community could really relate to it. Seeing real fear in the woman's face is very affecting. It feels unflinching and aggressive in its commentary on society. I remember going to Tower Records and seeing it huge; it was just so impactful. I'm not sure that it would work today. I give MCA respect for pushing it out at the time.\u201d 15/30 16) Pink Floyd \u2013 Wish You Were Here Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson's geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here \u2013 taken by Aubrey \u2018Po\u2019 Powell \u2013 is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of \u201cgetting burnt\u201d. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so. 16/30 15) Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumours Just two of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood\u2019s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record\u2019s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it\u2019s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel. 17/30 14) Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 It\u2019s Blitz! The instantly iconic cover of It\u2019s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There\u2019s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman\u2019s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive. 18/30 13) Madonna \u2013 True Blue This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d and \u201cYou Can Dance\u201d covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol\u2019s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna\u2019s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand. 19/30 12) The Clash \u2013 London Calling The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything \u201csafe\u201d that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith\u2019s photograph of \u201cthe ultimate rock\u2019n\u2019roll moment \u2013 total loss of control\u201d. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he\u2019d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment \u2013 just like The Clash. 20/30 11) Elvis Presley \u2013 Elvis Presley Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It\u2019s a visual introduction to rock\u2019n\u2019roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans. 21/30 10) NWA \u2013 Straight Outta Compton Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA\u2019s members to stand over him, with one holding \u201cwhat was hopefully an unloaded\u201d gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers. 22/30 9) Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Born in the USA The Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen\u2019s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist\u2019s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day\u2019s grind. \u201cWe took a lot of different types of pictures,\u201d said Springsteen, \u201cand in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.\u201d Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen\u2019s music. 23/30 8) The Ramones \u2013 The Ramones An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley \u2013 a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes. 24/30 7) The Beatles \u2013 Abbey Road Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it\u2019s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road\u2019s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision. 25/30 6) Grace Jones \u2013 Island Life Before he tried to \u201cbreak the internet\u201d with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones\u2019s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose; it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history. 26/30 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico \u2013 The Velvet Underground and Nico Like the working zipper of The Rolling Stones\u2019 Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to \u201cPeel slowly and see\u201d, upon which they\u2019d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It\u2019s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover. 27/30 4) Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures The cover art for Joy Division\u2019s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester\u2019s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 \u2013 from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. \u201cThe duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,\u201d Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. \u201cIts white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn't draw you in, the music will. 28/30 3) Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind This is one of the most recognisable album covers of all time, and makes a fierce, mocking statement about the value western society places on chasing wealth \u2013 and the way it passes that message onto future generations. Record label Geffen were concerned by the appearance of three-month old Spencer Elden's penis on the cover, but Kurt Cobain would only accept a censor sticker over the image if it read: \u201cIf you're offended by this, you must be a closet paedophile.\u201d 29/30 2) The Beatles \u2013 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, \u201cyou also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for\u201d. 30/30 1) Patti Smith \u2013 Horses Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder. \u201cThe only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,\u201d Smith told NPR in 2010. \u201cI got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, 'I got it'.\u201d 1/30 30) The Strokes \u2013 Is This It Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance \u2013 after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band\u2019s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He\u2019d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous \u201cass shot\u201d. The photograph, Lane later revealed in interviews, was taken in either late 1999 or 2000. His girlfriend had just got out of the shower, while he was playing with an old polaroid camera. He found a Chanel glove and asked her to pose. \u201cShooting on a Big Shot isn\u2019t easy: you can only shoot from a specific distance, and it\u2019s really designed for head-and-shoulders portraits,\u201d he explained to The Guardian. \u201cBut when she slid the glove on and bent forward, I knew it was the perfect shot \u2013 simple, straightforward, graphic and just so sexy.\u201d For fans, the image represents one of the last definable scenes in music. 2/30 29) The Notorious BIG \u2013 Ready to Die Biggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die.

But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet; a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face. 4/30 27) Nas \u2013 Illmatic One of the greatest debut albums \u2013 and arguably the best hip hop record \u2013 of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch\u2019s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper\u2019s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas\u2019s entire world, \u201cuntil I educated myself to see there\u2019s more out there\u201d. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling. 5/30 26) Kate Bush \u2013 The Dreaming Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her \u201cshe\u2019s gone mad\u201d album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini\u2019s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist\u2019s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was \u2013 and still is \u2013 associated. 6/30 25) Oasis \u2013 Definitely Maybe Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover.

But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music. 13/30 18) Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols \u201cThe album will last. The sleeve may not,\u201d said the adverts for the Sex Pistols\u2019 first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols. They\u2019d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word \u201cbollocks\u201d on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history. 14/30 17) The Roots \u2013 Things Fall Apart For a limited time, The Roots\u2019 Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world\u2019s \u201cgreatest turmoils\u201d. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot \u2013 a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers. \u201cThis became the main artwork for a few reasons,\u201d art director Kenny Gravillis told Complex magazine. \u201cThe cover felt like the urban community could really relate to it. Seeing real fear in the woman's face is very affecting. It feels unflinching and aggressive in its commentary on society. I remember going to Tower Records and seeing it huge; it was just so impactful. I'm not sure that it would work today. I give MCA respect for pushing it out at the time.\u201d 15/30 16) Pink Floyd \u2013 Wish You Were Here Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson's geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here \u2013 taken by Aubrey \u2018Po\u2019 Powell \u2013 is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of \u201cgetting burnt\u201d. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so. 16/30 15) Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumours Just two of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood\u2019s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record\u2019s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it\u2019s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel. 17/30 14) Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 It\u2019s Blitz! The instantly iconic cover of It\u2019s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There\u2019s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman\u2019s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive. 18/30 13) Madonna \u2013 True Blue This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d and \u201cYou Can Dance\u201d covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol\u2019s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna\u2019s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand. 19/30 12) The Clash \u2013 London Calling The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything \u201csafe\u201d that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith\u2019s photograph of \u201cthe ultimate rock\u2019n\u2019roll moment \u2013 total loss of control\u201d. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he\u2019d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment \u2013 just like The Clash. 20/30 11) Elvis Presley \u2013 Elvis Presley Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It\u2019s a visual introduction to rock\u2019n\u2019roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans. 21/30 10) NWA \u2013 Straight Outta Compton Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA\u2019s members to stand over him, with one holding \u201cwhat was hopefully an unloaded\u201d gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers. 22/30 9) Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Born in the USA The Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen\u2019s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist\u2019s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day\u2019s grind. \u201cWe took a lot of different types of pictures,\u201d said Springsteen, \u201cand in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.\u201d Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen\u2019s music. 23/30 8) The Ramones \u2013 The Ramones An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley \u2013 a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes. 24/30 7) The Beatles \u2013 Abbey Road Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it\u2019s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road\u2019s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision. 25/30 6) Grace Jones \u2013 Island Life Before he tried to \u201cbreak the internet\u201d with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones\u2019s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose; it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history. 26/30 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico \u2013 The Velvet Underground and Nico Like the working zipper of The Rolling Stones\u2019 Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to \u201cPeel slowly and see\u201d, upon which they\u2019d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It\u2019s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover. 27/30 4) Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures The cover art for Joy Division\u2019s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester\u2019s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 \u2013 from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. \u201cThe duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,\u201d Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. \u201cIts white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn't draw you in, the music will. 28/30 3) Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind This is one of the most recognisable album covers of all time, and makes a fierce, mocking statement about the value western society places on chasing wealth \u2013 and the way it passes that message onto future generations. Record label Geffen were concerned by the appearance of three-month old Spencer Elden's penis on the cover, but Kurt Cobain would only accept a censor sticker over the image if it read: \u201cIf you're offended by this, you must be a closet paedophile.\u201d 29/30 2) The Beatles \u2013 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, \u201cyou also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for\u201d. 30/30 1) Patti Smith \u2013 Horses Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder. \u201cThe only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,\u201d Smith told NPR in 2010. \u201cI got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, 'I got it'.\u201d\n\nThere is a noticeable split between the tracks Lo keeps for herself and those she writes for other artists. Those, like Ellie Goulding\u2019s \u201cLove Me Like You Do\u201d or Zara Larsson\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Bout Me\u201d, tend to be breezy and feather-light, all fairytale euphoria and happy endings. But Lo\u2019s own are almost anti-fantasy, reflective of hurt feelings and deep wells of insecurity, even when things are going well. On \u201cMistaken\u201d, one of the highlights of Lo\u2019s new album Sunshine Kitty, she lies awake at night terrified that her lover doesn\u2019t feel the same way about her as he did his ex. \u201cI think you love the way you looked together, maybe I\u2019m mistaken/ I can tell myself it doesn\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s hitting my heart\u201d. On \u201cReally Don\u2019t Like U\u201d, a seductively sparse duet with Kylie Minogue, she guiltily judges her ex-boyfriend\u2019s new love, purely out of spite.\n\n\u201cIf a song is just 100 per cent \u2018everything is perfect\u2019, I can\u2019t relate to it, and I can\u2019t feel it,\u201d Lo explains. \u201cIt might be fun and cool but it doesn\u2019t touch me or resonate with me in any way. I think it\u2019s because if you\u2019re in a really amazing situation where everything is great, there\u2019s always that little hint of fear that it\u2019s all gonna go away. Nothing is static when it comes to emotions.\u201d\n\nSince she was nine years old, Lo has kept a journal, writing down thoughts that eventually became poems and then song lyrics. Her childhood in the suburbs of Stockholm was superficially idyllic \u2013 she was the daughter of an entrepreneur father and a psychologist mother. But she found herself struggling with anxiety and depression. That she had everything other people thought she needed only made her more uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cI remember just being, \u2018Everyone\u2019s smiling and happy, and I\u2019m smiling but I\u2019m not happy.\u2019 And it was so exhausting faking it,\u201d she says. \u201cI had that feeling of, \u2018I don\u2019t have any problems. Why am I sad? I have a great family, I have a roof over my head, I have a dog, I have friends.\u2019 And I would get pissed at myself for being sad.\u201d\n\nWhile her familial wealth doesn\u2019t diminish her experiences with depression, she says that she has always been aware of the privilege she has been afforded. And it extends to her sexuality, too. She is often asked for advice by young fans on how they should come out to their parents, she explains, but that she tends to demure, reasoning that it\u2019d be \u201cdangerous\u201d for her to answer. \u201cI grew up in a super-liberal family,\u201d she says. \u201cI never even came out to my parents because there was never any thought in my mind that because I was making out with girls, that was bad. And because I still liked boys, it was more, \u2018I don\u2019t know what this is.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even define myself for a long time because I didn\u2019t feel like I had to, I didn\u2019t need to.\n\n\u201cSo for me to talk about that when people have such different upbringings and experiences, I think it\u2019s a dangerous thing for someone who had it very easy to speak out on. Because I didn\u2019t have the experience that a lot of kids have, where it\u2019s extremely tough.\u201d\n\nAs a teen, she developed a \u201ccrazy fascination and love\u201d for Nirvana, but it was Kurt Cobain\u2019s wife, Hole frontwoman Courtney Love, who had the most profound impact on her. Love was both adored and vilified, merging a punk ethos with radio-friendly pop hooks, her lyrics soaked in caustic wit and brutal honesty. Her frankness when it came to body image, fame and feminism, specifically on Hole\u2019s seminal 1998 record Celebrity Skin (\u201cThat album was my everything,\u201d Lo says), can all be found in Lo\u2019s own material.\n\n\u201cIt was sadness and darkness written with humour and with sass,\u201d Lo remembers. \u201cI think that really resonated with me, and the honesty about darkness in shiny, plastic situations. Growing up in quite a posh area, I would feel that so much. Everything is clean and perfect, and everyone is looking clean and perfect, but it\u2019s still a miserable vibe here.\u201d\n\nHaving fallen in love with music and songwriting, Lo enrolled in the prestigious Rytmus music school in Stockholm, where she became close friends with Caroline Hjelt, later one half of \u201cI Love It\u201d duo Icona Pop. They would go on to work the same local pop scene together, before an A&R spotted Lo and invited her to Los Angeles, where she began to collaborate with the ubiquitous Swedish producer Max Martin, and write tracks for Girls Aloud, Lea Michele and The Saturdays.\n\nBut while Martin mentored her as a songwriter, Lo was discreetly releasing her own music on the side, her lyrics deliberately deconstructing the coy metaphors and coded language that dominated his work with the likes of Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys or Taylor Swift. Her debut album, 2014\u2019s Queen of the Clouds, released on the back of the success of \u201cHabits (Stay High)\u201d, was met with critical and commercial success. Two more albums, Lady Wood and Blue Lips, expansive concept pieces split into chapters and accompanied by short films, followed.\n\nBut her past successes didn\u2019t come about through the healthiest of creative processes. \u201cI\u2019ve always written from a space of chaos,\u201d she explains. \u201cI wanted to create this world for my fans and make a double album and it was a big effort that I\u2019m so proud that I followed through with, but it was also because I\u2019d just been through some s***. I take on these massive projects because to create stuff is how I work through things. It\u2019s a very personal need.\u201d\n\nAs well as undergoing surgery in 2015 after potentially voice-destroying cysts were found on her vocal chords, Lo says it took her many years to feel comfortable in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel at home in the life of being an artist,\u201d she explains. \u201cBeing a person in the public eye, and being a person that someone has opinions about in general. Getting used to being away from my family and my friends and them being used to it, and being worried about my voice.\u201d\n\nShe has grown better since. She\u2019s now based in Los Angeles, a city she has come to love, and has been in a healthy relationship for more than a year. For a while, such personal ease led her to believe Sunshine Kitty was happier than the records that came before it. But she\u2019s lately come to realise that\u2019s not strictly true.\n\n\u201cWhen I listen to it, I notice there\u2019s still quite a lot of sadness there as well,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think I felt that way because I was writing it from a calmer and happier place. I remember I was kind of like, \u2018How do you write when you\u2019re just in a good space?\u2019 Like what do you grab your inspiration from? But it was cool to see that I don\u2019t need to be in chaos to write, and that I don\u2019t need to be unhappy to make good songs. I\u2019ve always been quite vulnerable in my songs but I think the difference is there\u2019s an acceptance now or like a love for being vulnerable instead of being angry about being vulnerable.\u201d\n\nAfter so many years of struggling with herself, and feeling drawn to chaos and emotional upheaval, has she finally found some kind of balance? There\u2019s a pause.\n\n\u201cUh... no.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI feel I\u2019m as balanced as a person who is like me can ever be. I\u2019ve always had sections of depression in my life, but I think now \u2013 I\u2019m very emotional still, I can be very up and down, but it passes, and I know that it passes. So I let myself cry out of nowhere and people around me are like, \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 But I tell them, \u2018Just ignore me, it will pass!\u2019 Or I\u2019ll throw s*** around or yell, but I try to do that in private so I don\u2019t freak people out too much. But I let myself feel it, because I know it will pass. I\u2019m in balance with my semi-crazy side. I\u2019m in tune with it.\u201d\n\nShe lets out a cathartic sigh. The burning hot coffee, the one she went to pains to specifically request an hour before, has sat untouched, and is now at room temperature. Maybe she\u2019s mellowed more than she thinks.\n\nSunshine Kitty is released on 20 September", "description": "Tove Lo deals in absolutes.
