How could I have allowed this to happen, as a part of this country, as someone who held public office, as an El Pasoan?\u201d\n\nOn the trail, I\u2019ve heard him tell a story that captures how he says he\u2019s changed. In the spring of 2018, he was walking in El Paso in a local companion event to the national March for Our Lives, organized by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He was in Congress then, and running for Senate, a race he would go on to lose in November. Henry, his younger son, asked him why counterprotesters nearby were holding assault rifles. Hadn\u2019t the whole day been about getting rid of those weapons? Henry asked.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Ah, don't worry about that. These are very nice people and they're just trying to make a point. You know, under Texas law, they can do it, but don't worry about it. Don't give them any attention,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Rourke told me last week, repeating the story. \u201cWhat I should have said is \u2018No, you're right, Henry: That is absolutely wrong, and there's nothing funny about that. And you're right to point this out and be disturbed by it, and you should be angry, and it should make you a little bit afraid, and it's a very natural reaction.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn this new phase of his candidacy, O\u2019Rourke says he wants to live out the consequences of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. His campaign has been incorporating specific stops into his schedule: one of the towns in Mississippi where Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently raided food-processing plants; a community-leader roundtable in Charlottesville, Virginia, the site of the 2017 white-supremacist march; an LGBTQ synagogue in Manhattan; a mosque in New Hampshire. These stops, he says, make more sense than eating corn dogs and making speeches at the Iowa State Fair, which is what the other candidates did the weekend after the shooting. (O\u2019Rourke had been slated to appear in Iowa as well, before canceling after the shooting.)\n\n\u201cTo quote Shakespeare\u2014or Geddy Lee from Rush\u2014I mean, we're all actors on that stage, and no one more so than perhaps somebody running for president. But I couldn't go do that,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told me, referring to the Iowa trip. \u201cI have to, as much as I can, be as honest as I can. I have to go do the things that I think are important.\u201d\n\nKick over the wall \u2019cause government\u2019s to fall\n\nHow can you refuse it?\n\nLet fury have the hour, anger can be power\n\nDo you know that you can use it?\n\nWe spent the bus ride talking about the El Paso shooting and what it meant to him, because these days, O\u2019Rourke is always talking about the El Paso shooting and what it meant to him.", "description": "The former Texas congressman says the recent mass shooting in El Paso changed his thinking on the presidential race.
