Once adjusted for inflation, they have now gone above 2% for the first time in nearly four years.\"\n\nIf you prefer to be \"half-full\", you will be happy that in the three months from May to July, the ONS recorded the fastest pay rise (including bonuses) for more than 11 years.\n\nIf you're more \"half-empty\" you may note that if you strip out the effect of inflation, pay including bonuses is still \u00a323 less than it was more than 11 years ago.\n\nSimilarly, a half-full view might note that employment is at a new record of 32.8 million people. A half-empty one might say it's not always a good thing that more women now have to work into their 60s because they can no longer claim the state pension.\n\nThere is no doubt, though, that the labour market remains tighter - tighter than it was a year ago - and that employees are benefiting, especially in sectors such as construction where there are shortages of labour.\n\nSome of that tightness, however, may now be easing, with vacancies continuing to drop from their recent record highs.\n\nThere was a total of 32.78 million people aged 16 or over in employment. The increase in employment has been mainly driven by more women in work, the ONS said, which is partly down to the rise in the state pension age, meaning fewer retire between the ages of 60 and 65.\n\nThere was a rise of 284,000 employed women over the year to a total of 15.52 million. Male employment also rose by 86,000 to reach 17.26 million, mainly because of rising numbers of self-employed.\n\nHowever, the number of people aged between 16 and 64 considered economically inactive continued to rise, increasing by 6,000 to 8.59 million.\n\nEmployment Minister Mims Davies said the figures indicated the labour market was \"booming\", adding that it was \"especially pleasing to see continued record female employment\". And Chancellor Sajid Javid said the wage data showed \"that people across the country are taking home more every week\".\n\nBut shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: \"The slowdown in job creation is a concern with the current uncertainty over Brexit, and average pay still has not returned to the level it was in 2008.\n\n\"For millions of people, the reality of work is one of low pay and insecurity.\"\n\nDebapratim De, UK economist at Deloitte, warned \"the glory days of rapidly falling unemployment could be behind us\".\n\nHe added that the figures indicated \"a tight labour market and further gains in consumer spending power\".\n\nAnd Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"The renewed fall in the unemployment rate distracts from an otherwise troubling labour market report.\n\n\"Brexit uncertainty undoubtedly has sapped firms' enthusiasm for hiring new workers, but sharply rising unit labour costs also are playing a role.\"\n\nHowever, PwC economist Jing Teow said evidence of continued jobs growth, together with the stronger-than-expected growth figures released on Monday, \"reinforces our view that the UK should avoid a technical recession in the third quarter\".\n\nHe added that the accounting giant predicted \"potential GDP growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of 2019. This would more than reverse the 0.2% GDP decline seen in the second quarter\".", "description": "Earnings continue to outstrip inflation and the employment rate remains at a record high.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11501/production/_108731907_officeworkers2_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
