She was arrested in August after crossing to the West Bank to attend a family wedding and so far has not been indicted.\n\nSafadi said Israel's administrative detention of both citizens was \"illegal\" and vowed his country would \"take all necessary legal and diplomatic measures to ensure their safe return home.\"\n\nJordan's relations with Israel have been strained in recent years and the kingdom, which is one of only two Arab states that have a peace treaty with its neighbour, fears Israel's possible annexation of territory in the occupied West Bank, where expansion of settlement building over several decades has dimmed prospects of a future Palestinian state.\n\nThe peace treaty with Israel is unpopular among the people of Jordan, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is widespread.
