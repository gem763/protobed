It is unclear what his job was.\n\nWHAT IS AUTO-BREWERY SYNDROME? Auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) causes sufferers to feel intoxicated and unable to perform simple tasks. It usually occurs due to yeast accumulating in the intestines after the sufferer ingests sugar. The syndrome occurs when a sufferers' yeast in their intestines grow out of control, possibly following a course of antibiotics. ABS may also be caused by abnormal enzymes in the liver. Anyone of any age can suffer. ABS is so rare its prevalence is unknown. There is no cure. Avoiding sugar and carbohydrates may help to control symptoms, as well as frequently monitoring a sufferer's blood alcohol content.

His case will be presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology later this month\n\nDr Malik told New Scientist: 'He was extremely happy when he started to recover, because for years, no one believed him.\n\n'The police, doctors, nurses and even his family told him he wasn't telling the truth, that he must be a closet-drinker.\n\n'Now he is off antidepressants, he's back at work and he's finally getting on with his life.'", "description": "The 46-year-old was diagnosed with auto-brewery syndrome at Richmond University Medical Center in New York.
