It revealed that 90 per cent of them planned to vote Remain.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that after three years of shambolic negotiations, the fashion industry\u2019s concerns about leaving the EU are very much still in tact.\n\nIn January, the BFC said a no-deal Brexit \u201cshould be avoided at all costs\u201d and voiced its support for a Final Say vote, a stance that countless designers \u2013 from Vivienne Westwood to Katharine Hamnett \u2013 have since backed up.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

This is largely due to the 71-year-old designer\u2019s famous slogan T-shirts, which bear phrases such as: \u201cFashion Hates Brexit\u201d, \u201cSecond Referendum Now\u201d and \u201cCancel Brexit\u201d. Having founded her namesake label in 1979, Hamnett has 40 years of experience under her belt.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, the designer explains that restricting free movement in a post-Brexit landscape would be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the fashion industry.\n\n\u201cFashion personnel come from all over the world, and British designers, the best in the world, travel all over,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cRoughly 75 per cent of all British fashion industry components have to be imported, so Brexit would ensure delays, which are fatal to a brand\u2019s reputation. Nothing is better than what we already have: being members of the EU.\u201d\n\nRichard Malone\n\nRichard Malone might\u2019ve only graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2014, but the Irish designer has already established himself as one of the most exciting talents in the industry. His collections are lauded for their sculptural influences and avant-garde patterns.\n\n\u201cWhat makes the fashion industry in London so rich and creative is the mix of the brilliant cultures that you find here,\u201d Malone enthuses.\n\n\u201cNot only does Brexit mean we\u2019re going to miss out on the unique perspectives that fuel the creativity London is known for, but we\u2019re going to lose so much talent after leaving the EU and especially in the event of no deal,\u201d he tells The Independent.\n\nMalone also argued that Brexit will have a huge impact in terms of losing valuable team members.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t seem to realise that we\u2019re already experiencing a shortage of skills, and that\u2019s going to get significantly worse if we\u2019re not well prepared,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI came to London almost eight years ago, and Brexit just feels like a turn in the completely wrong direction.\u201d\n\nHenry Holland\n\nHenry Holland is famed for his loud and eye-catching designs that boast a firm celebrity following, with Lily Allen, actor Jaime Winstone and model Agyness Deyn all longtime supporters of his label.\n\nHaving risen to attention in 2006 for his graphic slogan T-shirts that bore phrases such as \u201cI\u2019ll Tell You Who\u2019s Boss Kate Moss\u201d, Holland has always been viewed as a confident and fearless fashion figurehead.\n\nAs a made-to-order manufacturing business, Holland says he thinks the main challenges would be managing relationships with his wholesale partners around the world.\n\n\u201cWe have now sold our autumn/winter 2019 collection and will possibly be delivering post Brexit,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut in light of increased tariffs, shipping delays and the overall impact of the strength of the pound, it\u2019s hard to see how Brexit will have any positive effects whether there is a deal or not.\u201d\n\nThe designer explains that his team have ultimately sold an entire collection with \u201cno idea\u201d what the cost of these goods will be to them when the time comes to import them.\n\n\u201cOur margins for the next year are a complete guess and this has potentially catastrophic effects on the entire industry,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere are obviously mitigating factors in terms of where the bulk of the manufacturing is done for many brands \u2013 luckily a large portion of ours is done outside of Europe \u2013 but the effect on the exchange rates and import and export tariffs, for want of a better word, remain.\u201d\n\nMatty Bovan\n\nMatty Bovan is one of the fledgling design talents in the industry, whose eponymous brand is worn by well-heeled folk like model-of-the-moment Adwoa Aboah.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, the 28-year-old York-based designer reveals his stores have \u201cthankfully\u201d already received their spring deliveries, which has alleviated some of the Brexit-induced pressure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much up in the air regarding Brexit,\u201d he says, \u201cand no one has been able to offer definitive advice to someone such as myself.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s still early to speculate what will happen next. I\u2019d like to see how things settle further. We have several new stores showing interest, so let\u2019s see how this impacts things.\u201d\n\nHannah Weiland\n\nHannah Weiland founded Shrimps in 2013, launching the label with a single faux fur coat. The brand has since evolved into a popular outerwear, clothing and accessories business, whose fans include Alexa Chung and Kate Moss.\n\n\u201cAs a small, London based-brand, we work and trade with businesses based within the EU, that helps us to keep costs down and helps us to achieve the results we want within our means, as well as hire international talent,\u201d Weiland tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cBrexit would really compromise this for us and for our customers, not to mention the negative impact on the economy in general that would come from such a drastic change, which will inevitably be disastrous for the fashion and luxury industry.\u201d\n\nBella Freud\n\nBella Freud has been running her namesake London-based label since the early 1990s and is famed for her plush, slim-fitting slogan jumpers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone in the fashion business who voted leave,\u201d the womenswear designer tells The Independent.\n\nFreud adds that the loss in value of the pound has already had an adverse effect on the UK fashion industry.\n\n\u201cThe cost of importing fabrics and finished goods is eroding the profit margin, which is affecting every stage of the supply chain. Consumer confidence has been seriously battered with the drop in house prices.\n\n\u201cThis is before Brexit has even happened.\u201d\n\nOlivia von Halle\n\nOlivia von Halle has been adding a heady dose of glamour to our nightwear since 2011. The London-based label has made a name for itself by selling matching silk pyjama sets that are far too fancy to actually sleep in. Celebrity fans include Selena Gomez, Bella Hadid and Jennifer Lopez.\n\nUnlike some of her industry comrades, Von Halle is marginally more optimistic about what Brexit means for her.\n\n\u201cThe fashion industry now is such a global business that I don\u2019t think Brexit will have a huge impact in terms of sales in the luxury sector,\u201d she tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cWhat happens with Brexit does not fundamentally change demand. However, we will perhaps see more of an impact for British brands when it comes to staffing, in offices and stores, if we lose the free movement of people within the EU.\u201d\n\nVon Halle added that she is in the fortunate position given the fact that her business extends beyond the borders of the EU, and explained that the way Brexit impacts fashion brands will largely depend on where they import their goods from.\n\n\u201cTherefore the direct impact on our business not being a member of the EU is less significant than it could be,\u201d she continues. \u201cIn fact as an exporter of luxury goods the effect on the currency and the weakness against the dollar has been good for business.\n\n\u201cWe import most of our goods from China and export the majority to the US with markets like Canada and Australia also being significant. So any future trade deals we could strike with those countries to lower tariffs would be hugely beneficial.\u201d", "description": "Shortly before\u00a0the EU referendum in 2016, the British Fashion Council (BFC) conducted a poll involving\u00a0500 designers.
