She was worried that if she tried to get back into the house, an item would hit her.\n\n\"She waited for a few minutes until she couldn't hear anyone in the rear yard nextdoor and went back into her home address.\n\n\"Once she knew it was safe she went back out to retrieve the broken item from her yard for the police.\"\n\nPolice, who were aware of the previous problems Nicholson had caused, were called.\n\nMiss Dowling said: \"While they were doing their inquiries, an officer saw a white bag appear from next door and it landed at the back gate of the complainant's address.\n\n(Image: newcastle chronicle)\n\n\"That bag was found to contain excrement.\"\n\nWhen police opened the gate to Nicholson's back yard, where the bag had come from, he was standing there.\n\nThe policeman also noticed items in the house matching the design of other missiles he had thrown over the nine-foot wall dividing the properties.\n\nThe court heard Nicholson was first convicted of harassing Miss Brydie in November 2018, when he got a conditional discharge.\n\nIn March this year he got a suspended prison sentence for harassment and breaching the conditional discharge.\n\nThen in April he got a nine-month suspended sentence for harassment and common assault in relation to Miss Brydie.\n\nShe said in a victim impact statement which she read to the court: \"I'm a victim of harassment following multiple incidents with my neighbour, Nicholson.\n\n\"Since he was sentenced in April, I've been subjected to items being thrown over to my yard which could have hit me and caused serious injury.\n\n\"I reported all matters to the police but the items continued to be thrown even after he was arrested.\n\n\"It often happened six times a day and this has caused me stress.\n\n\"Because of this I've had to seek help from my GP.\n\n\"I feel like a prisoner in my own house and couldn't carry out my normal life.\n\n\"He has no respect for the restraining order or the advice given by the judge.\n\n\"He has also pestered my dad. I had to live at my dad's because of him.\"\n\nJudge Robert Adams sentenced Nicholson to eight months prison, with a restraining order banning him from contacting the victim or from entering Corbridge and Stocksfield, which means he cannot go to his former address, where he lived with his dad, on Saint Helen's Street, Corbridge.\n\nThe judge said: \"One could argue it was intended to maximise distress by throwing excrement over the wall.\"\n\nSue Hirst, defending, said the current offence happened over the course of one day.\n\nShe told the court: \"I fully acknowledge there is no excuse for what she has had to tolerate in this case.\n\n\"The defendant has considerable vulnerabilities.\"\n\nShe added that accommodation has been found for him at a hostel in Newcastle.\n\nThe court heard he has a \"psychiatric history\", including autism and an intellectual disability and he is vulnerable.", "description": "Lee Nicholson, 29, was already subject to two suspended prison sentences for tormenting his neighbour Jennifer Brydie before the latest clash", "authors": ["Rob Kennedy", "Image", "Ncjmedia Ltd", "Newcastle Chronicle"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575195.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Lee-Nicholson-mugshot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
