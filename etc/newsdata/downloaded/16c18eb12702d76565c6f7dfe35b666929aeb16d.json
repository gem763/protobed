Here's what you need to know:\n\nWho are the Kurds?\n\nJUST WATCHED Fleeing civilians tell CNN they don't know where it's safe Replay More Videos ...

Most Kurds are Sunni Muslims.\n\nBefore World War I, traditional Kurds lived a nomadic lifestyle until the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, which stripped them of their freedom and divided them into new nation-states.\n\nKurds have struggled to maintain their identity, often being referred to as \" Mountain Turks \" in Turkey, where they were forbidden to wear traditional Kurdish outfits or speak their language. They continue to face discrimination and policies of persecution.\n\nAlthough Kurds are the largest ethnic minority in Turkey, making up roughly 20% of the population, they are not recognized as a minority group in Turkey.\n\nWhere do Kurds live?\n\nKurdistan is now one of the world's largest stateless nations, a non-governmental region whose people have no official homeland or country.\n\nToday, Kurdistan is made up of five different regions: southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, northern Iraq, northwestern Iran and southwestern Armenia.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Kurds began working toward the creation of homeland known as Kurdistan. In 1920, the Treaty of S\u00e8vres - one of a series of treaties that the Central Powers signed after their defeat in World War I - outlined the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and called for an autonomous Kurdistan.\n\nThree years later, after the end of the war, Western allies dropped demands for an independent Kurdish state and the Kurdish region was divided among several countries.\n\nWhat does Turkey have to say?\n\nJUST WATCHED Turkish adviser: 'Clear understanding' with US on Syria Replay More Videos ...

The President made it clear that his ultimate goal is to eliminate the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish far-left militant and political organization based in Turkey and Iraq that fought the Turkish state for more than three decades.\n\nThis has built a deep divide between Turks and Kurdish Turks. In 2016, pro-Kurdish media outlets were closed down, more than 11,000 teachers were dismissed or suspended over alleged PKK connections and at least 24 government appointees replaced Kurdish mayors in the country.\n\nTurkey has long been unhappy about the strong Kurdish presence in northeast Syria near the Turkish border. The country's military has already moved into portions of areas previously held by the Kurdish-led and US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), but now their longtime plan to create a buffer zone in northern Syria is underway.\n\nThere are two goals: drive the Kurds away from from their border, and use this area to resettle around 2 million Syrian refugees.\n\nWhy is Turkey attacking them now?\n\nIn January, President Trump said the United States would begin withdrawing troops from Syria and \" slowly \" send them back home. Syrian Kurds feared Turkey would use the withdrawal as an opportunity to launch an assault.\n\nBut after Trump's sudden announcement Sunday night, these fears were realized.\n\n\"Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,\" a White House statement said. \"The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial 'Caliphate,' will no longer be in the immediate area.\"\n\nAs of last month, the United States said about 1,000 US troops were operating in northeastern Syria. This move leaves Syrian Kurds at the mercy of an operation aimed to clear them out and away from the Turkish border.\n\n\"#OperationPeaceSpring will neutralize terror threats against Turkey and lead to the establishment of a safe zone, facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homes,\" Erdogan tweeted Wednesday. \"We will preserve Syria's territorial integrity and liberate local communities from terrorists.\"\n\nHow will attacking the Kurds risk the return of ISIS?\n\nJUST WATCHED Retired Gen.

Somehow, all these fighters may be handed over to Turkey.\n\nAs many Syrian Kurds prepare to fight and others run in the opposite direction, thousands of terrorists and two holding facilities containing displaced ISIS members and ISIS survivors will be left ungoverned.\n\nThis poses a serious risk as ISIS will have an opportunity to reestablish itself.", "description": "Hundreds of Kurdish people living in northern Syria near the Turkish border are fleeing, herding their loved ones and running from an unknown fate as fires blaze behind them.", "authors": ["Alaa Elassar"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191009191136-13-turkey-syria-offensive-1009-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
