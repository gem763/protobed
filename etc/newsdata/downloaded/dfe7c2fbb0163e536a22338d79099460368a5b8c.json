It'll be used to launch NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft from Kennedy Space Center\u2019s Launch Pad 39B for future Artemis missions to the Moon.\n\nIn 2017, NASA said that Kennedy Space Center had sustained \u201ca variety of damage\u201d as a result of Hurricane Irma. A year earlier, the government agency reported limited damage to Kennedy Space Center from Hurricane Matthew.\n\nForecasters said Dorian was most likely to begin pulling away from the Bahamas early Tuesday and curving to the northeast parallel to the U.S. Southeast seaboard. Still, the potent storm was expected to stay close to shore and hammer the coast with dangerous winds and heavy surf, while authorities cautioned that it could still make landfall.\n\nAccording to a Monday morning advisory from the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami, the storm was virtually parked over Grand Bahama island, which was in for a \"prolonged period of catastrophic winds and storm surge\" though the night. It also said Florida's east-central coast may see a brief tornado sometime between Monday afternoon and Monday night.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Associated Press and Fox News' James Rogers contributed to this report.", "description": "Incredible satellite images of\u00a0Hurricane Dorian\u00a0\u2014 the Category 5 monster that continues to batter parts of the Bahamas with wind gusts up to 220 mph \u2014\u00a0have been shared by\u00a0NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the storm continues to wreak\u00a0havoc.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/7e2d5925-hurricane-dorian-1.jpg"}
