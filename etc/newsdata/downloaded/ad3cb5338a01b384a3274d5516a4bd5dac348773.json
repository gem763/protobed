REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\n\nWhile Warren has risen in the past month into a virtual tie with former Vice President Joe Biden in opinion polls atop the Democratic race, most other contenders face an urgent challenge in breaking out of the pack while the political world is riveted by the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry of Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nThe first nominating contest in the Democratic race to pick a challenger to Trump in the November 2020 election is Feb. 3 in Iowa, giving candidates less than four months to make their case to voters on why they are best suited for the job.\n\nMany of the contenders also face a scramble to qualify for the next Democratic debate in Georgia in November, when polling and fundraising qualifying criteria will be even tougher. So far, just eight candidates have qualified.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s debate, moderates Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar aggressively went after Warren to explain how she would pay for ambitious proposals including her Medicare for All plan and how much they would cost.\n\nBoth candidates are trying to break out of the middle of the crowded Democratic pack. Buttigieg has qualified for the November debate, while Klobuchar has not.\n\n\u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where to send the invoice,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar pushed back when Warren said critics of her wealth tax were trying to protect billionaires, saying: \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\u201d adding: \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nCRAMMED DEBATE STAGE\n\nThe sharp exchanges were a sign of the heightened stakes as a dozen candidates crammed the debate stage in the electoral battleground state of Ohio. It was the most crowded debate so far in the Democratic presidential race.\n\nThe debate comes at a critical time, as Biden has seen his once solid lead in opinion polls among Democrats diminished by Warren, a leader of the party\u2019s progressive movement, who has steadily risen over the past two months.\n\nWarren stayed calm under the attacks, offering her proposals to end income inequality and level the economic playing field for workers.\n\nShe did not directly respond to questions about whether she would raise taxes for the healthcare plan, but she said she would not sign any bill that does not lower healthcare costs for middle-class families.\n\n\u201cI have made clear what my principles are here, and that is that costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and, for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,\u201d she said.\n\nThe expansive Medicare for All proposal, based on the government-run healthcare plan for Americans over age 65, has sharply divided Democratic presidential contenders. Some analysts have said it would cost $32 trillion over a decade.\n\nMany other Democratic candidates back a Medicare-based plan as just one option for Americans seeking healthcare coverage.\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who sponsored a bill in the Senate to create a Medicare for All plan, said he thought it was \u201cappropriate to acknowledge that taxes would go up\u201d under the proposal.\n\nThe debate marked the return of Sanders, 78, the oldest candidate in the field, who suffered a heart attack two weeks ago and has been recuperating at home in Vermont since having stents inserted to open a blocked artery.\n\nSanders will return to the campaign trail on Saturday with a rally in New York, where a Sanders campaign source said he would be endorsed by progressive U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He also was endorsed on Tuesday by U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, an ally of Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe two congresswomen have been frequent targets of Trump for their views.\n\nTrump, who has blasted the impeachment probe and denied any wrongdoing, on Wednesday dismissed the field of candidates, tweeting: \u201cNow you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!\u201d", "description": "The Democratic presidential contenders head back to the campaign trail on Wednesday after a debate that featured repeated attacks on surging progressive U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and exposed the party's divisions on issues like healthcare and taxes.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441438178&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0SD", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
