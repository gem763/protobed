Eventually, it will begin integrating autonomous capabilities as cities get more comfortable with the technology.\n\nTortoise has developed reference designs that manufacturers, at rental companies' request, can use to build scooters equipped with the necessary sensors. The company's designs add less than $100 to a scooter in costs for the additional tech, says co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko.\n\nThe company's tech uses 2 cameras, a processor, a radar chip, a motor (on the base of the steering column), and robotic training wheels for 2-wheel vehicles in place of a kickstand.\n\nTortoise charges the rental companies roughly $50\u2013$100 per scooter per month to operate and insure the vehicles, though it plans eventually to move to a per-mile price.\n\nEven today, with humans fully operating the vehicles remotely, this approach is still cheaper than having workers on the streets to pick up and shuttle the vehicles, says Shevelenko. This is in part because Tortoise's operation center is in Mexico City, so its labor costs are relatively low. He expects costs to go down even more as autonomous tech replaces humans.\n\nYes, but: As with the scooter rental services themselves, regulatory approval is the biggest obstacle, according to Shevelenko. The top question from rental companies so far has been about whether it can get cities to accept the new tech.", "description": "Meet Tortoise, a startup that wants to make scooters drive themselves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/wJKX3zSClNoYRxOYMd3q5Se9aQI=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/15/1571116212424.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
