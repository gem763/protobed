It\u2019s all hands-on-deck for grassroots folks and everybody in DC,\u201d said Meagan Hatcher-Mays, director at the grassroots organization Indivisible.\n\nAfter months of slow-moving conversations about impeachment, even some groups who had been pushing for months to impeach Trump \u201cgot really caught off guard\u201d when Pelosi finally backed an inquiry, one operative said -- and they were immediately outgunned after news broke that their party would try to impeach the president.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential campaign had pre-filmed an ad focused on impeachment, which it used to raise more than $8 million in two days after the impeachment push began. Soon after, Trump and the RNC launched a $10 million advertising offensive, some of it targeting House Democrats who are facing difficult reelection bids.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/5b/48/9e2282cc4bdc8f056865e09c54f9/artboard-1.png\"\n\nIn total, Republicans have spent $6.3 million in advertising on television, Google and Facebook focused on impeachment since Pelosi announced an inquiry on September 24, while Democrats have spent $2.4 million, according to Advertising Analytics.\n\nIn the days since, more than two dozen major progressive organizations started joining a daily conference call, hosted by MoveOn.org, to share plans and strategize. Pelosi\u2019s office has also circulated talking points to organizers off Capitol Hill, urging them to push the most basic facts surrounding Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine: That the president asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, tried to cover it up and put national security at risk.\n\nOn the Wednesday call, veteran Democratic pollster Jeremy Rosner and Petkanas zeroed in on the findings of a new poll as they worked to get dozens of Democratic organizations prepared to explain why impeachment is necessary. Voters indicated they found Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine most troubling because they indicate he \u201cthinks he is above the law,\u201d the survey showed \u2014 an argument that will also work as pushback when the White House tries to dodge congressional subpoenas.\n\nBut few voters were deeply stirred by the notion that Trump had criminally violated campaign finance law, the poll showed, making that a likely no-go in the multi-million dollar ad wars to come.\n\nDemocratic organizations are beginning to launch ad campaigns to counter Trump\u2019s lead and make the case to voters that he should be impeached. Need to Impeach has already begun spending $3.1 million targeting Senate Republicans on impeachment. The ads that no longer feature the group\u2019s former leader Tom Steyer, who is now running for president, and instead target individual senators: \u201cTell Susan Collins to put country over party,\u201d one ad airing in Maine says.\n\nThe progressive digital organization ACRONYM this week launched a $1 million online campaign in five swing states focused on impeachment, and Indivisible and MoveOn.org are among the other organizations also considering running media campaigns. (Need to Impeach plans to air more ads in the future and ACRONYM is considering expanding its advertising to a national scale.)\n\nTrump\u2019s advertising is \u201clargely focused on keeping his base fired up and on fundraising,\u201d said Shannon Kowalczyk, chief marketing officer at ACRONYM. \u201cHe\u2019s not spending as much time talking to that broader swath of American people who may have questions about this process and may have not made up their minds.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the groups with grassroots members feel Democrats will have the votes they need to impeach Trump in the House, so they are already looking to pressure Republican senators to break ranks with their party and vote to remove Trump from office.\n\nIndivisible, which includes 5,000 local chapters, has outlined plans to target 13 Republican senators, including several vulnerable lawmakers up for reelection like Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Thom Thillis (R-N.C.), retiring Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), and select others who have been critical of Trump, such as Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah).\n\nIn addition to tapping organizers in those states, Indivisible and other groups have begun using phone banking and peer-to-peer texting to allow out-of-state volunteers to rally support across state lines. Some of that work has started during the current congressional recess, though leaders from grassroots organizations say they are preparing members for a lengthy, intense issue campaign.\n\nDemocratic operatives argue the Ukraine controversy has black-and-white contours that play in their favor in ways other recent Capitol Hill battles -- such as the Mueller investigation and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination \u2014 did not. With Mueller, in particular, those operatives say the lack of a clearly stated conclusion about whether the president had committed impeachable offenses made it difficult to make a public case for impeachment.\n\nTrump\u2019s communications with Ukraine will be easier to sell to the public, Democrats hope: Already, support for impeachment has shot up in recent days, reaching 50 percent in a poll conducted this week by POLITICO and Morning Consult. Even the way the story quickly broke into the public consciousness, after the White House\u2019s efforts to keep it quiet, made for a dramatic unveil with Nixonian echoes, Democrats say.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep this as simple as possible,\u201d said David Sievers, campaign director at MoveOn.org. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than Watergate. As much as activists can, [they need to] keep it simple and say, \u2018Are we okay with that? If not, there\u2019s only one thing Congress can do in response to that, impeachment.\u2019\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/85/b0/d3ddb28c4928916650f21df4e72c/191012-impeach-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
