Ted Lieu, D-Calif. Ukraine \u201cis clearly going to be the issue that\u2019s going to drive the bus,\u201d said Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich.\n\nMore like the Magic Bus. Hear their chant. The President \u201chas put national security at risk in order to advance his own narrow personal interests,\u201d fears Kildee, who is Chief Deputy Whip of the House Democratic Caucus and released his formal statement Sep. 24.\n\nAs you can tell, the far-left obsession with impeaching Trump is emotional and partisan. So much unhappiness. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still regards Trump as \u201can illegitimate president\u201d as she told CBS on Thursday, Sep 26.\n\nThe Bill Clinton impeachment did not involve foreign policy. Nor did the Nixon impeachment inquiry; however, a fourth Article on bombing Cambodia was actually voted down in the summer of 1974, along with a fifth article on Nixon\u2019s taxes.\n\nBut there\u2019s a scary reason why the attack from these unhappy impeacheroos now requires dragging US diplomacy through the muck with Ukraine as a star player.\n\nImpeachment needs high crimes and misdemeanors \u2013 and something Americans will buy into. The Dem caucus is banking on the fact that most of us Americans don\u2019t follow Ukraine closely.\n\nThey don\u2019t talk about the tense military confrontation there, the 13,000 deaths, or if new President Volodymir Zelensky can clean up corruption and fulfill his election pledge for peace talks with Russia. The far-left doesn\u2019t remember Lt. Col. Seth Nehring, the Fresno, California Air National Guard fighter pilot who died there last fall assisting Ukrainian forces. (He was killed flying with a Ukranian pilot on a training mission.)\n\nTo get the impeachment show going, the far-left and others obsessed with President Trump need you to believe he\u2019s doing critical damage to our national security.\n\nThat\u2019s simply not the case.\n\nOur military is stronger. President Trump reorganized defense spending so that fighting forces get training and spare parts. Navy F/A-18EF fighter planes on aircraft carriers now meet their minimum 80% readiness goals. Programs are funded to keep the US edge in high technology like hypersonic missiles.\n\nTrump took on China\u2019s bad behavior after 20 years of Clinton-Bush-Obama drift. Trump\u2019s gradual implementation of tariffs called out China\u2019s unfair business practices and intellectual property theft and ongoing cybercrimes.\n\nNATO is stronger, too. NATO stood with U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty, and the alliance is making strides in deterring Russian aggression.\n\nIn the Persian Gulf, Britain, France and Germany last week came over to the US position and named Iran as the perpetrator of the shocking attack on Saudi oilfields. Those three big allies also now support Trump\u2019s insistence that Iran talk about serious new restrictions on nuclear activity, military aggression and missile proliferation.\n\nUkraine policy is stronger. President Obama wouldn\u2019t deliver the funding for lethal aid to Ukraine requested by Congress. Trump authorized lethal aid in December 2017, including Javelin anti-tank weapons, common in NATO.\n\nWhat worries me is that the anti-Trump outrage is starting to damage international security. When former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says \u201cI know he\u2019s an illegitimate President,\u201d I believe her statement is bad for American foreign policy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOK, then she believes every meeting, treaty and agreement since Trump was inaugurated is null and void? The strikes on Syrian chemical weapons facilities in 2017 and 2018 were not legitimate? Is that really her view? Why does she try to undermine a duly elected president in his third year in office?\n\nThe Democratic impeachment poseurs want you to believe Trump is shredding American policy behind closed doors. Don\u2019t fall for it.\n\nCould the president watch his mouth? Sure. But I will take his boisterous activity over Obama\u2019s cynical inaction any day.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nMy research showed that what took place in the weeks after the Trump-Zelensky call was a lot of normal foreign policy meetings. Vice President Mike Pence met Zelensky in Warsaw on Sep. 1. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry met with Zelensky. Senator Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Senator Chris Murphy, D-Conn., met Zelensky on Sep. 5. Pompeo telephoned Ukraine Foreign Minister Prystayko on Sep. 17. Business as usual. And the foreign aid as appropriated by Congress is on its way.\n\nHardly a clear and present danger. Let the American people decide on November 3, 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBECCA GRANT", "description": "Why did foreign policy with Ukraine get dragged into impeachment?\u00a0Because it\u2019s crucial for the far-left to get you to believe Trump is a danger to national security.", "authors": ["Rebecca Grant", "Rebecca Grant Is A National Security Analyst Based In Washington", "D.C.", "She Earned Her Ph.D. In International Relations The London School Of Economics At Age Then Worked For Rand", "On The Staff Of The Secretary Of The Air Force", "Chief Of Staff Of The Air Force.
