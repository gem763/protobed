Sign up here.\n\nJulian Assange struggled to say his own name and date of birth when he appeared for his latest extradition hearing Monday morning. \u201cI can\u2019t think properly,\u201d he told the judges.\n\nThe WikiLeaks founder appeared in a London court clean-shaven, wearing a blue suit, and holding a bundle of papers. He raised a defiant fist to his supporters in the public gallery when he entered the room, but on the stand, the effects of his six-months long detention in the maximum-security Belmarsh Prison became obvious.\n\nThe 48-year-old, who\u2019s facing up to 175 years in prison if he\u2019s sent back to the U.S., told the court he was \u201cin fear for his life\u201d and struggled to say his name and date of birth. In fact, he admitted he didn\u2019t really understand what was going on.\n\nIn May, Assange was deemed so unwell that he was unable to appear at a court hearing via video link from Belmarsh Prison. He was moved to the prison\u2019s hospital wing after a \u201cdramatic\u201d loss of weight, according to WikiLeaks.\n\nLast month, Assange\u2019s father also said his son was being kept in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day in conditions he described as \u201csordid and hysterical.\u201d\n\nIn court Monday, Assange complained about not having access to a computer while in jail and said he was battling against a \u201csuperpower\u201d with \u201cunlimited resources.\u201d In May, the U.S. charged Assange with conspiring to help U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning break into the computer systems of the Pentagon as well as sharing a disseminating top-secret U.S. government information under the Espionage Act\n\nU.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid already signed an extradition request, but the courts will now decide if Assange should be sent to the U.S. to face trial. Even if a judge grants the U.S. application, the movie will still require the sign-off from whoever is home secretary at the time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how this is equitable,\u201d Assange told Judge Vanessa Baraitser Monday. \u201cThis superpower had 10 years to prepare for this case, and I can\u2019t access my writings. It\u2019s very difficult where I am to do anything, but these people have unlimited resources.\u201d\n\nAssange\u2019s legal team applied to the court for a delay, claiming the extradition effort was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and a \u201cwar on whistleblowers. But the judge denied the request, and the final hearing will begin as planned on Feb. 25, 2020.\n\nAssange has been behind bars since April when he was forcibly removed from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London which had been his home for the previous seven years after he sought to avoid facing allegations of rape in Sweden. Assange has already served a sentence for skipping bail back in 2011.\n\nREAD: Pamela Anderson redeclares her love for Julian Assange after visiting him in prison\n\nAssange and his team have always claimed that the U.S. prosecution, initiated by Barack Obama and reinvigorated under Donald Trump, threatens freedom of the press. They claim that a conviction under the Espionage Act would mean that anyone who publishes sensitive national security materials could face a similar prosecution.\n\nAssange\u2019s lawyer Mark Sommers claimed in court that the U.S. government \u201chas been actively engaged in intruding on privileged discussions between Mr. Assange and his lawyer.\u201d\n\nOutside Westminister Magistrates Court on Monday supporters of Assange, held a protest organized by the Socialist Equality party, chanting \u201cFree Julian Assange\u201d and \u201cNo extradition, there\u2019s only one decision.\u201d\n\nCover image: File photo dated 11/04/19 of Julian Assange who is expected to appear in person in court today, as his extradition case continues.
