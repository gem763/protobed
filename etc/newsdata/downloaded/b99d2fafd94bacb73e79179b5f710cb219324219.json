Right: Nickie and Ben Bennett, the parents of Sophie Bennett\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Ms Bennett's father Ben Bennett said: 'It is not about the sentence he's getting, it's that he has never accounted for himself or produced the evidence.\n\n'We have not got the full picture.\n\n'His apology means nothing, he has had plenty of opportunities to do that. It is too late.'\n\nIn a victim impact statement read in court, Mr Bennett, described how the care home 'went from being a caring, kind and therapeutic place, to a shambolic, unsafe and uncaring place' following 'pivotal' input from Lawrence.\n\nHe said: 'It has been a constant and exhausting struggle to try and ensure that all the processes, investigations and inquiries are properly conducted and completed.\n\n'The inquest should have finally revealed the full truth to us about Sophie's avoidable death.\n\n'Duncan Lawrence's behaviour denied us this.'\n\nHe added: 'The family was astounded, upset and insulted by the string of lame and disingenuous excuses the he gave to the coroner's court for his failure to cooperate.\n\n'We have been deeply insulted and distressed by the contempt that he has shown to us, the court, and to Sophie's memory by his behaviour.'\n\nThe court heard how the teenager, from Tooting in south-west London, was bipolar and had atypical autism and social anxiety.\n\nShe was found hanged in a bathroom on May 2 2016 and died two days later in Kingston Hospital as a result of her injuries, a post-mortem examination found.\n\nAn inquest jury found in February that neglect contributed to the teenager's death and oversight at the facility was 'grossly inadequate'\n\nLawrence was the interim manager when Care Quality Commission staff arrived for an urgent inspection of the care home two months before Ms Bennett's death, ranking it inadequate in a number of areas.\n\nAn inquest jury found in February that neglect contributed to the teenager's death and oversight at the facility was 'grossly inadequate'.\n\nProsecutor Charles Shelton had previously said Lawrence was notified he should attend the inquest in October last year, telling the court: 'The defendant made a number of recommendations as to how the care home should operate.\n\n'The coroner considered therefore he was an important part of the inquest.'\n\nLawrence, who was not represented, told the previous hearing he had 'extenuating circumstances' of caring for both parents who later died and said he had provided some written statements to the coroner.\n\nHe said he was guilty '100%' but maintained he had 'wrongly assumed' written statements would suffice.\n\nDespite being the clinical lead at the home and understood by staff to be a medical doctor, Ms Bennett's inquest heard Lawrence did not have a legitimate medical doctorate, and had obtained a certificate from a 'degree mill' in Denmark.\n\nCQC inspector Wynne Price-Rees said he found Lawrence 'disengaged' and lacking knowledge of essential care documents at the 'chaotic' facility.\n\nMagistrate John Soones said: 'In view of your work at the care home you were expected to give important information to the coroner.\n\n'Irrespective of your personal circumstances you failed to do that properly despite the coroner making all efforts to help you.\n\nMs Bennett had been a resident at Lancaster Lodge, pictured, for around a year at the time of her death\n\n'This goes to the heart of the inquest process ... to be able to get all the facts leading up to the death of Sophie Bennett.\n\n'There's a real prospect of custody. We urge you to seek proper legal advice.'\n\nLawrence admitted withholding evidence/documentation in relation to a coroner's inquest contrary to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.\n\nThe charity Inquest, which is working with Ms Bennett's family, believes the 'unprecedented case' is the first time someone has faced criminal charges for failing to provide evidence to a coroner.\n\nLawrence, who was no longer working at the care home at the time of Ms Bennett's death, initially said he could not attend the three-week inquest in person as he was caring for his sick mother in Alaska.\n\nBut he failed to appear before the coroner on video-link amid claims he was actually in south London - not the US - at the time, later stating his no-show was down to 'ongoing stress' in his 'personal life'.\n\nThe sentencing on Wednesday comes as the CQC attempts to bring a separate legal action against the Richmond Psychosocial International Foundation (RPFI) and manager Peggy Jhugroo, who was a senior figure at Lancaster Lodge at the time of Ms Bennett's death.", "description": "Duncan Lawrence repeatedly refused to answer questions about the regime at Lancaster Lodge in Richmond following the death of 19-year-old Sophie Bennett in May 2016.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/20375300-0-image-a-12_1572439878360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
