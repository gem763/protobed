USA TODAY\n\nHow will this year's World Series play out? Using the Dynasty League Baseball online simulation, USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner and DLB designer Mike Cieslinski will pre-play each game to provide some insight into the key matchups and strategy fans can expect to see in the Fall Classic.\n\nGame 4: Houston Astros at Washington Nationals\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the most tense and competitive game of the 2019 Simulated World Series, the Houston Astros rode on second baseman Jose Altuve's shoulders to a 5-3 victory over the Washington Nationals in Game 4.\n\nBOX SCORE:Astros 5, Nationals 3\n\nAltuve stunned the sellout crowd at Nationals Park with a mammoth 435-foot, two-run home run in the top of the first inning. Then in the third, Altuve struck again off Nats starter Patrick Corbin with an RBI triple to left-center that gave the Astros a 3-0 lead.\n\nA screenshot of Jose Altuve's two-run homer in the first inning of Game 4 in USA TODAY's Simulated World Series. (Photo: Dynasty League Baseball)\n\nCorbin was not sharp, giving up seven hits and four earned runs, but he battled through six innings and kept the Nationals within striking distance -- especially after Juan Soto got Washington on the board with a solo homer in the bottom of the fourth.\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY: Altuve provides Astros' offense, bullpen shuts down Nats\n\nThe top of the Nationals order came up with some clutch hits in the middle innings. Trea Turner tripled and scored on a sacrifice fly by Adam Eaton in the fifth. Then in the seventh, Eaton deliverd a solo homer to right to cut the Astros' lead to 4-3.\n\nLater in the seventh, Howie Kendrick very nearly put Washington on top with a runner on base and two outs, but his long fly ball died in the glove of Josh Reddick on the left field warning track.\n\nCatcher Robinson Chirinos gave Houston some breathing room in the top of the ninth with a solo homer, and closer Roberto Osuna retired the Nats in order in the ninth to preserve the win.\n\nPrevious Sim Series results\n\nGAME 1: Astros 4, Nationals 0\n\nGAME 2: Astros 10, Nationals 2\n\nGAME 3:Nationals 4, Astros 1\n\nWhat to watch in (the actual) Game 4\n\n\u2014 Bullpen game: Astros manager A.J. Hinch has already said he'll have rookie Jose Urquidy start Game 4. Working on one week's worth of rest since his last outing, Urquidy should be able to pitch fairly deep into the game. Veteran Brad Peacock, who pitched to three batters in Game 3, could also see action as well as the Astros plan on making this a \"bullpen game.\"\n\nThat could mean an important role for switch-hitter Asdrubal Cabrera, who got the start at second base for the Nationals in Game 3 and would have the platoon advantage against the parade of right-handed Astros relievers.\n\n\u2014 Altuve comes up big: As in the actual Game 3, second baseman Jose Altuve was the key to the Houston offense -- collecting three hits and driving in three runs. It's almost a given with Altuve getting on base at least once in each of his last 23 postseason games.\n\n\u2014 Going lefty: The Nationals will give the Astros a bit of a different look in Game 4, turning to left-hander Patrick Corbin. Houston doesn't platoon very much, but will likely give outfielder Jake Marisnick the start over Josh Reddick because he hits right-handed.\n\nMarisnick went 2-for-5 in Sim Series Game 4 and scored twice so he could be an important factor in the Astros offense. In addition, having Marisnick in the starting lineup will give the Astros an extra left-handed pinch-hitter to deploy in the middle and later innings once Corbin is out of the game.\n\n\u2014 Scoring first: Washington should have the advantage early with Corbin, a 14-game winner during the regular season, on the mound. He was especially effective at Nationals Park, where he went 8-2 with a 2.40 ERA and 0.99 WHIP -- and was also the winning pitcher in Washington's NLCS-clinching Game 4 against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nIt will be important for the Nationals to get on the board early and force the Astros to use as many relievers as possible. However, that didn't happen in Sim Series Game 4 thanks to Altuve's homer in the top of the first.\n\nCorbin's six-inning stint -- along with two solid innings from Tanner Rainey -- will at least give the Nats bullpen enough rest to have almost everyone available for Game 5.\n\nSimulate your own World Series.
