This is Money podcast", "language": "en", "text": "It's been a rocky week to say the least for Britain's most recognisable fund manager Neil Woodford \u2013 he suspended trading in his flagship fund, leaving savers unable to access their cash.\n\nAnd we still don't know the future of Sir Philip Green and his Arcadia empire, after a crucial rescue vote was suspended.\n\nThis is Money assistant editor Lee Boyce, retail reporter Emily Hardy and host Georgie Frost discuss how it has gone wrong for the pair.\n\nWhat has led Woodford to this point, could there be a Financial Conduct Authority investigation, are savers trapped in the fund safe \u2013 and can he recover?\n\nArcadia \u2013 with brands like Burton and Topshop \u2013 could be set to close 50 stores with the loss of 1,000 staff. What is a CVA and why hasn't Sir Philip managed to get a deal approved this week?\n\nWe also discuss the High Street in general and a worrying set of figures \u2013 what can be done to help stop the decline?\n\nElsewhere, we run the rule over a 'bonkers' plan for first-time buyers to raid pension pots for deposits and Lee urges savers to engage with their retirement savings.\n\nAnd we finally manage to get the Pensions Minister to give us a precise figure on how many people may have received incorrect state pension forecasts.", "description": "It has been a rocky week for fund manager Neil Woodford and retail mogul Sir Philip Green - what has gone wrong for the pair and what can they do to recover?", "authors": ["This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
