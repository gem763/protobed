Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham, Sheffield United and Everton are the only teams apart from Liverpool to have managed that.\n\nSurprisingly, such a start has mostly led to an unsuccessful bid to win the top-flight title.\n\nOf the seven occasions that a team has won eight from eight at the start of the season, only twice has that side gone on to become champions of England in that same campaign.\n\nChelsea managed it under Jose Mourinho in 2005-06, but you have to go back to 1961 for the only other instance, when Tottenham won their second and most recent league title.\n\nIn 1991, Liverpool finished second to Arsenal after their perfect start, while Manchester United could only manage fourth after winning their first 10 in a row in 1985-86.\n\nSheffield United ended up down in seventh after storming to eight straight wins to kick off the campaign back in 1904, and Everton were league runners-up to Sunderland in 1894-95.\n\nCan Liverpool buck this trend in 2019-20? Their first game after the international break might give some indication, when they will look to match City's 18-match winning run \u2013 by beating Manchester United at Old Trafford.", "description": "Liverpool's perfect start to the Premier League season does not necessarily point to a title win, if history is anything to go by.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2gz.L2GvtSLi0VOnrLkafQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rrpi4sXk7BX9bNreiRW0LQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/58a2ba600db2d0fbba5be223922589dc", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
