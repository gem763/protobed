In an excerpt from her new book, \u201cResistance at All Costs: How Trump Haters are Breaking America,\u201d out Tuesday, Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal examines how far the press will go in its relentless crusade.\n\nLast week The Washington Post revealed the alarming news that House Democrats were considering having their anonymous \u201cwhistleblower\u201d testify from a remote location, and in disguise. Just as shocking as the details of this plan was the justification the Post ladled on this Democratic effort to hide impeachment information from the public.\n\nDAN GAINOR: NY TIMES COLUMNIST ADMITS THERE\u2019S AN ANTI-TRUMP DEEP STATE \u2013 BUT CLAIMS MEMBERS ARE THE GOOD GUYS\n\nIt explained, high up in the story, that the cloak-and-dagger approach was merely Democrats expressing \u201cdistrust of their GOP colleagues, whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower\u2019s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThis, from a newspaper with a tagline of \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness.\u201d Maybe the better journalistic epitaph is: Democracy dies in bias. How did journalism get here?\n\nI\u2019ve never engaged much in media criticism, because it\u2019s almost too obvious. Yes, the mainstream media is liberal and biased. But at least in the past, that bias was largely a function of insularity. Most reporters weren\u2019t even fully aware they were prejudiced politically; everyone they worked and socialized with held the same left-of-center views.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat\u2019s changed in the age of Trump. The press has embraced its bias, joined the Resistance and declared its allegiance to one side of a partisan war. It now openly declares those who offer any fair defense of this administration as Trump \u201cenablers.\u201d It writes off those who question the FBI or Department of Justice actions in 2016 as \u201cconspiracy\u201d theorists. It acts as willing scribes for Democrats and former Obama officials; peddles evidence-free accusations; sources stories from people with clear political axes to grind; and closes its eyes to clear evidence of government abuse.\n\nThis media war is extraordinary, overt and increasingly damaging to the country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS PIECE IN THE NEW YORK POST\n\nExcerpted from \u201cResistance at All Costs: How Trump Haters Are Breaking America\u201d by Kimberley Strassel, Copyright \u00a9 2019.
