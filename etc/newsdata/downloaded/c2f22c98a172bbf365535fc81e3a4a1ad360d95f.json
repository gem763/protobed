It isn't. At this rate he will hit record numbers by the time the curtain is drawn on 2019-20.\n\nLewandowski's ability to maintain his lofty standards season after season is testament to his mentality, having seen recent years bring mounting speculation of an exit.\n\nFifteen goals so far - that is just in club football - shows that everything he touches turns to goals. Two braces and a hat-trick already in the league have seen the 31-year-old race into an early lead for the European Golden Boot.\n\nIf nothing else, it has sent alarm balls ringing for other strikers across the continent.\n\nRobert Lewandowski is out on his own as the most lethal finisher across Europe right now\n\nTammy Abraham - 9 goals\n\nClub: Chelsea\n\nWhen Chelsea finally accepted their two-window transfer ban from FIFA, there was natural trepidation that they were unable to bolster the squad after Eden Hazard's departure to Real Madrid.\n\nThe Belgian was unquestionably the Blues' main attacking threat and had become central to everything good about the team. Simply put, the offense ran through him.\n\nBut in came Frank Lampard and the ban allowed him to put his trust in youth, namely Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham.\n\nAnd it has been the latter that is far and away one of the stories of the season so far, with nine goals across all competitions. Life after Hazard really doesn't seem so bad after all!\n\nChelsea's transfer ban has handed Tammy Abraham his chance and he is thriving in attack\n\nSergio Aguero - 8 goals\n\nClub: Manchester City\n\nWhile Pep Guardiola's side face a mountain to climb to make it three successive Premier League titles, Sergio Aguero is not suffering any kind of slump as he boasts eight goals in eight games this season.\n\nThe Argentine has been underrated each year as he continues to demolish records and defences, showing no sign of a let up as he adds years and miles to his body clock.\n\nWith the creative force around him at City, chances are never an issue and if City can rid themselves of the frailties defensively and go back to putting teams to the sword, Aguero will again find himself with a wealth of goals to his name.\n\nLewandowski's early season numbers will put no fear in the competitive Argentine.\n\nSergio Aguero is averaging a goal a game right now despite Manchester City's early woes\n\nRaheem Sterling - 8 goals\n\nClub: Manchester City\n\nNo player has improved under Guardiola at Manchester City more than Raheem Sterling.\n\nRid of the inconsistencies he showed when he joined the club from Liverpool, Sterling is now rightly considered one of the finest stars in world football and his attacking output is proof of that.\n\nHe managed 11 goals in 2014-15 and 10 in 2015-16 and 2016-17 before he began to take his game on to a new level. In Guardiola's first season in charge at the Etihad he netted 23 goals and improved that to 25 goals in 2018-19 as the club clinched the Premier League title by a single point.\n\nDominating matches for club and country, as well as assisting those around him, Sterling is fast becoming the most-sought after attacker in Europe.\n\nNo player has improved under Pep Guardiola at Man City as much as Raheem Sterling has\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang - 8 goals\n\nClub: Arsenal\n\nIf attack is the best form of defence for Arsenal then there are few players the club would rather have leading the line than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\n\nThe Gabon striker has seven goals in eight games this season and has thrived down the middle since Alexandre Lacazette was struck down with injury.\n\nHistory suggests he is just warming up, as well. It was 2014-15 the last time Aubameyang finished a season with less than 30 goals and so Arsenal fans have reason to be excited that Aubameyang is already fit and firing.\n\nHe has been urged to work harder for his chances but his sixth sense to be in the right place at the right time, making chances look easy, goes undervalued. Expect him to be pushing all the way to be Europe's top marksman.\n\nThe goal burden has fallen to Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang with Alexandre Lacazette injured\n\nCiro Immobile - 8 goals\n\nClub: Lazio\n\nHe may not be best friends with his manager but by taking his anger out by scoring goals, no one of a Lazio persuasion will be complaining right now.\n\nImmobile has strangely been the fall-guy in a number of games this season with boss Simone Inzaghi looking to freshen the side up in the second half of games.\n\nBut with eight goals already this season, seven placing him top of the Serie A scoring charts, the 29-year-old is a man on a mission to win Europe's Golden Boot this season.\n\nHe is making good progress to matching his goal return of 19 last season - but will have to continue his purple patch for some time if he is to emulate - or even beat - his 40-goal haul from 2017-18.\n\nCiro Immobile tops the scoring charts in Serie A despite his ongoing feud with his manager\n\nVictor Osimhen - 8 goals\n\nClub: LOSC Lille\n\nWhat is it with LOSC LIlle and finding gems to lead their line? This summer the French club felt the impact of Nicolas Pepe's success when they agreed a record \u00a372m deal for him to join Arsenal.\n\nThat left money burning a hole in the club's pocket and RSC Charleroi striker Victor Osimhen was picked up for \u00a311m - that already feels like one of the bargains of the entire summer window.\n\nThe 20-year-old Nigerian is leading the scoring charts in France in a league where most of the notable forwards are hoovered up in Paris by PSG.\n\nOsimhen has seven goals and two assists already and has been shortlisted for Ligue 1's Player of the Month. If he keeps this up he will be the undisputed choice for Young Player of the Year come May.\n\nDespite losing Nicolas Pepe to Arsenal, Lille have found a new star in striker Victor Osimhen\n\nDuvan Zapata - 7 goals\n\nClub: Atalanta\n\nThe scary thing with Duvan Zapata is that he still feels he has 'a lot of room for improvement' despite seven goals already this season.\n\nAtalanta have flopped in the Champions League, losing their opening two group games, but that is not down to the in-form Zapata.\n\nBehind only Immobile in Serie A, Zapata is another attracting plenty of admiring glances from Premier League sides with Manchester United the latest to get credited with an interest in the Italian press.\n\nAt 28, Zapata is in his prime moment, bullying defences in Serie A and may be tempted by a fresh challenge. If he keeps scoring goals at the rate he has so far, La Dea face an exhausting fight to keep him.\n\nDuvan Zapata picked up where he left off last season as he is among the goals for Atalanta\n\nTimo Werner - 7 goals\n\nClub: RB Leipzig\n\nLinks to Liverpool refuse to disappear and if he keeps finding the back of the net, calls will only get louder and louder for a shot at the Premier League.\n\nThe 23-year-old is fast becoming one of Europe's most exciting strikers and the arrival of Julian Nagelsmann has not derailed his ascent up the goals chart.\n\nHe is second behind Lewandowski domestically but already has two goals in the opening two group games of the Champions League.\n\nEven at this early stage, Werner is a third of the way towards matching his best ever goal return of 21 - his first season at Leipzig back in 2016-17.\n\nTimo Werner is already a third of the way towards matching his career best season goal tally\n\nKarim Benzema - 6 goals\n\nClub: Real Madrid\n\nLuka Jovic was bought for \u00a362million in the summer and yet he has not got off the mark in six La Liga appearances.\n\nThat has seen Zinedine Zidane continue his reliance for goals with Karim Benzema and he is the division's joint-top scorer after the opening eight rounds of matches.\n\nReal Madrid are top, five wins and three draws, and have Benzema to thank for some big results, none bigger than the narrow 1-0 away win against Sevilla last month. He is yet to strike in the Champions League but the confidence is there.\n\nIf Zidane and Co are going to win just their second domestic title in eight seasons, they need Benzema front and centre of their ailing attack.", "description": "While the 2019-20 season remains in its infancy across Europe's top five leagues, some strikers are in no mood to ease their way in.
