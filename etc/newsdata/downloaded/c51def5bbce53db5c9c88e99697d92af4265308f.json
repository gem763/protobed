And that could put Maloney in prime position to assume the gavel, according to lawmakers and aides.\n\n\u201cObviously, no one is going to be able to fill the shoes of Elijah Cummings,\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who is in his second term on the panel, said Monday, without expressing support for a specific member. \u201cI think what\u2019s important in the position is that they\u2019re also going to be able to work closely with [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff and with the speaker.\u201d\n\nDemocrats must hold an election for the chairmanship within 30 days of the vacancy, according to the caucus rules. But no public announcements on timing are expected until after Cummings\u2019 funeral services at the end of this week.\n\nThe opening on the Oversight panel puts Democrats in a difficult position: multiple lawmakers and aides acknowledge that the committee lacks a deep bench of battle-hardened lawmakers ready to take on Trump.\n\nBut most also realize that a caucus-wide contest could expose ugly divisions across generational and racial lines \u2014 drowning out the Democratic Party\u2019s message on impeachment in what could be the final weeks of their inquiry.\n\nSome members of the Congressional Black Caucus have privately said they are willing to accept Maloney, even if it means losing one of their five chairmanships. But if anyone else wins the post \u2014 jumping over two of their own members \u2014 \u201call hell\u2019s gonna break loose,\u201d one aide said.\n\nMaloney, who has served on the panel since she came to Congress in 1993, is viewed as the choice of least resistance and defacto frontrunner. And the New York Democrat has already secured commitments of support from the next two most senior members on the panel, Norton and Clay. Both have agreed not to challenge her, according to two people familiar with Maloney\u2019s chairmanship bid.\n\nMaloney was seen working the floor on Monday evening, talking to several members and at one point gave Clay a big hug.\n\nThe backing of Norton and Clay could signal broader support for Maloney from the CBC, a powerful voting bloc of 53 members who generally support seniority above all else when picking committee chairmen.\n\nBut for other Democrats who have long waited on the sidelines due to the caucus\u2019 deference to seniority, a bid for the high-profile chairmanship may be hard to pass up. The panel\u2019s next chairman would not only have sprawling jurisdiction to investigate nearly every aspect of Trump\u2019s administration and businesses, but would be instantly thrust into the spotlight of Democrats\u2019 impeachment push.\n\nAnd some lawmakers and aides have questioned whether Maloney \u2014 who has never before served in such a high-profile leadership post \u2014 is prepared to become one of the party\u2019s leading voices on impeachment. Maloney was passed over for the job in 2010 after Democrats tapped Cummings, a less senior member, as their counterweight to bombastic Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.).\n\nMaloney is best known for her years of advocacy on the 9/11 victims fund, for which she famously donned a New York firefighter\u2019s jacket in the Capitol until she could secure permanent funding. But she has little national exposure on other oversight issues, though her allies point out that she\u2019s long been a fighter for progressive policies, particularly women\u2019s rights, consumer protection and gun control.\n\nDemocrats have also privately expressed concerns about how Maloney\u2019s impending primary will factor into the chairmanship election. The New York Democrat is facing several opponents, including a rematch against Suraj Patel, a Democratic activist who garnered 40 percent of the vote in the 2018 primary.\n\nThe high-profile chairmanship could give Maloney a significant advantage over her primary challengers. But if she\u2019s passed over for the job for the second time, that could offer Patel and any other potential opponents an opening to attack her as an ineffective representative, Democrats said.\n\nThe possibility of Maloney taking the helm has led to some other members quietly floating other candidates, including Connolly. A fixture on cable news and a fierce critic of Trump, Connolly would bring an attack dog aspect to Democrats\u2019 impeachment messaging that many lawmakers say is needed.\n\nConnolly, who leads a subcommittee on the panel, declined to discuss the race. \u201cIt can wait until after we pay proper respect to my dear friend, Elijah Cummings,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nClay and a Maloney spokesperson declined to comment on the potential chairmanship race. Speier\u2019s office did not return a request for comment. A source close to Jeffries, the House Democratic Caucus chairman, said he has \u201czero\u201d interest in the Oversight gavel.\n\nMultiple CBC lawmakers, granted anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations, said they expected Norton not to run even if Maloney bowed out. If that were the case, they would support Clay, a senior member of the CBC, for the chairmanship. Some CBC members discussed the issue after an impromptu caucus gathering to honor Cummings late Thursday, according to multiple people.\n\nOthers have argued that the Democratic caucus will lean on the widely-trusted Schiff to lead the impeachment push, regardless of who takes control of the Oversight panel. Schiff has been Democrats\u2019 primary messenger on their investigation into Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine for political gain since launching the impeachment inquiry a month ago.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it doesn't matter because Pelosi has already made Schiff the captain of the ship,\u201d one Democratic aide said.\n\nJohn Bresnahan, Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d1/e9/296f80b442c6bf8684c010f2bedd/20191021-maloney-nadler-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
