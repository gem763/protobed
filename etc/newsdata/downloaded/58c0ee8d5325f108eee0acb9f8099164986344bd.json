Mr Mander told Sky News on Wednesday \u201cthe laws she is talking about are very limited and only apply to people who bring lock-on devices to protests\u201d. \u201cThere needs to be consequences to these actions and there needs to be deterrence to make sure they don\u2019t come back and do the same thing,\u201d he said. The MP said the initiative \u201cis too little, too late\u201d, and will not \u201cstop people hanging from bridges, or stop protestors disrupting traffic\u201d.
