The remaining banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe IPO plan has rapidly gained momentum in recent days with the appointment of the head of the kingdom\u2019s PIF sovereign wealth fund, Yasser al-Rumayyan, as Aramco\u2019s new chairman.\n\nRumayyan, a close ally of Prince Mohammed, took over from former energy minister Khalid al-Falih in a move to separate Aramco from the ministry, a step Saudi officials have said was important to pave the way for the IPO.\n\nBankers have been courting Saudi Arabia to secure roles in the transaction, which has faced repeated delays, but which officials have said will happen by 2020-2021.\n\nAramco\u2019s chief executive, Amin Nasser, said this week that the domestic IPO would be the \u201cprimary\u201d listing but that the company was also ready for an international share sale. He said the final decision on venue and timing rested with the government.\n\nThe flotation is crucial for Prince Mohammed\u2019s plans to diversify the Saudi economy in an era of low oil prices.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Logo of Saudi Aramco is seen at the 20th Middle East Oil & Gas Show and Conference (MOES 2017) in Manama, Bahrain, March 7, 2017.
