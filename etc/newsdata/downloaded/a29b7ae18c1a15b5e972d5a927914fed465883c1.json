After months of waiting, Microsoft\u2018s entry in the cloud gaming race is ready to show itself \u2014 albeit to a group of users in specific test regions.\n\nThose invited to partake of the preview will be able to play a few Microsoft games, such as Gears 5, Sea of Thieves, and Halo 5, on their mobile devices. As the moniker \u201ccloud gaming\u201d suggests, you don\u2019t have to download the titles, but simply stream them from Microsoft\u2018s servers. Early reports from Reddit users claim the preview works fairly well, with some delay between input and action.\n\nProject xCloud is a go! pic.twitter.com/bY5tblv0CP \u2014 Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) October 14, 2019\n\nAt the moment, the preview is only available to gamers in the US, UK, and South Korea. According to the xCloud FAQ: \u201cIt will be a multi-year journey to deliver this technology to gamers around the world at the quality we want to meet, so we will be adding more regional availability as we learn more and create a great game streaming experience.\u201d\n\nxCloud\u2019s primary rival, Stadia, launches next month, so it\u2019s probably a good moment for Microsoft to remind everyone about xCloud\u2019s existence. While Google\u2019s been talking a good game about what Stadia is capable of in the lead-up to its launch, it\u2019s yet to allow users to really test it, and at launch the only people who\u2019ll be able to do so are those willing to shell out for the $129 Founder\u2019s Edition. A free preview from Microsoft is just a better look by comparison \u2014 albeit one that only a few people will be able to take advantage of.\n\nThe other potential competition, PlayStation Now \u2014 which doesn\u2019t work with mobile devices but which has the honor of being the first publicly available cloud gaming service \u2014 has recently dropped in price. The cloud gaming wars feel closer than ever, and it\u2019s good to see at least one of the two upcoming services is showing potential. Now the question remains to be seen: will it be able to hold up to scrutiny once it rolls out to a wider audience?\n\nTo sign up, you need an Android phone running 6.0 or later, a wireless Xbox One Bluetooth controller, 5Ghz Wi-Fi, and a Microsoft account.
