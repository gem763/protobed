REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nTheir run to the quarter-finals of the first World Cup to be held outside the heartlands of the game has led to an explosion of interest in the game beyond the realms of the imagination of even the most optimistic World Rugby executive.\n\nFrom the thousands of red-and-white clad fans in Tokyo Stadium for Sunday\u2019s match against the Springboks to the tens of millions more watching on TV up and down the country, the Brave Blossoms have captivated a nation.\n\nChants of \u201cNippon! Nippon! Nippon!\u201d echoed around the streets of the southern city of Oita on Sunday night as locals joined the Wales, England, France and Australia supporters - in town for two other quarter-finals - to watch the match.\n\nWith the city\u2019s fan zone packed beyond capacity long before the final last-eight clash started, multinational groups of fans huddled in groups around TVs wherever they could find them in bars, restaurants and street food stands.\n\nThere were tears from local fans to echo those of the Japan players after the 26-3 loss to the twice world champions but that disappointment was replaced quickly by pride at a remarkable achievement. [nL5N2750IF]\n\n\u201cDear Japan World Cup rugby squad, thank you so, so much for giving us much enthusiasm,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe whole month was like a dream. Proud to be in the last eight. I am very proud of your showing real strength against the world\u2019s best teams at Asia\u2019s first Rugby World Cup.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese national team could arguably do with a new nickname because, although there was no shortage of courage on display as they took on the hulking Springboks on Sunday, it was outstanding rugby that got them to their first quarter-final.\n\nNO FLUKE\n\nThat a nation humiliated 145-17 by New Zealand at the 1995 World Cup could better teams with long and proud rugby traditions such as Ireland, Scotland and Samoa was testament to a huge amount of hard work over the past five years. [nXXN273007]\n\nThese were not fluke wins, moreover, but deserved victories earned by a team playing an irresistible game at a blistering pace with fierce commitment and no little skill.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly the strongest and best, wonderful team, and the 31 here are the most wonderful players in the history (of Japanese rugby),\u201d flyhalf Yu Tamura said on Sunday.\n\nCoach Jamie Joseph\u2019s future is uncertain but, whether he decides to stay on or not, he is convinced that his team have left a legacy that will endure.\n\n\u201cThe rugby hasn\u2019t changed, but now there\u2019s been an audience,\u201d the New Zealander said. \u201cIt\u2019s created a voice for the team in that respect and hopefully that will give momentum for Japanese kids, and that\u2019s ideal.\u201d\n\nHow Japan go about building on that legacy is the big question, with a spot in the Six Nations or Rugby Championship looking unlikely and World Rugby\u2019s Nations Cup proposal having been scuppered.\n\nThe Tokyo-based Sunwolves team will play one last season of Super Rugby next year and although there have been other international competitions tabled that might include Japanese teams, all are still at the planning stage.\n\nThe legacy discussion will continue long after the tournament ends on Nov. 2 but Japan captain Michael Leitch had no doubt about the trajectory of the game in the nation of 127 million people.\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s only going to get stronger,\u201d the 31-year-old loose forward said succinctly at his post-match news conference.\n\n\u201cAll the best with the rest of the World Cup.\u201d", "description": "Japan were beaten up and bundled out of the World Cup on Sunday but whatever happens over the next two weeks will have to be pretty special for the Brave Blossoms to be displaced as the symbol of the ninth edition of rugby's showpiece tournament.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443266236&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0FI-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
