REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson expelled 21 lawmakers, including Soames, from the Conservative Party on Tuesday and barred them from running for the party in the next election after they voted for a motion that paves the way for Brexit to be delayed.\n\nSoames, 71, who has been a Member of Parliament (MP) since 1983, said Britain\u2019s image was being tarnished by Brexit.\n\n\u201cWhat really worries me is that Britain\u2019s stock in the world is in free fall and I\u2019m afraid our position in world affairs is going to be greatly diminished by this,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThis is the most divisive issue of my lifetime.\u201d\n\nIn an emotional speech in parliament, Soames said he has always supported pulling Britain out of Europe Union since the 2016 referendum and, unlike Johnson and other cabinet ministers, voted three times for former Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s EU divorce deal which parliament as a whole rejected.\n\n\u201cI have always believed that the referendum result must be honoured and indeed I have voted for the withdrawal deal .... which is more than can be said for my right honourable friend the prime minister, the leader of the house, and other members of the cabinet, whose serial disloyalty has been such an inspiration for so many of us,\u201d Soames told parliament.\n\nThe rebels say that Johnson, in his zeal for pulling Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal, is risking damage to the British economy and undermining its position as a party with priorities beyond Brexit.\n\nJohnson said that kicking out the lawmakers had not been easy but he had been upset by their decision to rebel.\n\n\u201cThese are friends of mine, and believe me, I take absolutely no joy in any of it. But it was very sad and surprising that they should choose to undermine the UK\u2019s ability to get a (Brexit) deal,\u201d Johnson told broadcaster ITV.\n\nSoames, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2014, previously served as a junior defence minister. He is the son of Mary Soames, the youngest of Churchill\u2019s five children.\n\nAlistair Burt, a former junior minister in the Foreign Office and another lawmaker expelled by the party, said eurosceptics have repeatedly found people to blame for why the government has not reached a deal with the EU, including Britain\u2019s lead Brexit negotiator and the bloc itself.\n\n\u201cThis time it is us, it\u2019s me, this is nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cI say to my colleagues: if we are being purged now, who is next?\u201d", "description": "Nicholas Soames, the grandson of World War Two leader Winston Churchill, said on Wednesday that Brexit is sending Britain's status into \"free fall\" after he was sacked from the Conservative Party for rebelling on a vote on leaving the European Union.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426245996&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831W8"}
