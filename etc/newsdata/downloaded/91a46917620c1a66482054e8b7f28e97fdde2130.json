The silhouette of the ring was clearly there right in the middle of her stomach.\n\nThings took a turn when she could feel the ring in her stomach and it started becoming painful for her.\n\nSo, rather than let the ring pass through her organs naturally, the doctor suggested that the safest way to retrieve her engagement ring would be to have an upper endoscopy to remove it.\n\n\"I was really happy because I don't know if I can look at it and appreciate it in the same way, if I had to search for it,\" Evans said to KGTV.\n\nThe procedure went smoothly and doctors were able to remove the ring from her intestines.\n\nEven after everything she has been through, Evans is thrilled to have her ring back.\n\n\"I feel very grateful that I got it back, and that this is a happy and funny story,\" Evans said.\n\nJenna and Bobby\u2019s nuptials are still on course to take place in her home state of Texas next May but with one difference in the preparations now.\n\nShe takes the ring off before she goes to sleep.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
