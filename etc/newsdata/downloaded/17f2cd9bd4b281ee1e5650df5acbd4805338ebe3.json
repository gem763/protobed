AMCL\u2019s Hong Kong office could not be reached for comment after office hours. An AMCL executive reached by Reuters declined to comment.\n\nOne of the sources said Unipec could seek to book further cargoes from the Middle East Gulf using AMCL\u2019s tankers.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said on Wednesday it was imposing sanctions on five Chinese nationals and six entities that it said had violated Washington\u2019s unilateral curbs on Iran.\n\nThese included two COSCO Shipping Corporation subsidiaries, COSCO Shipping Tanker Dalian and COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Co Ltd, as well as a separate company Kunlun Shipping Company Limited. Beijing accused the United States of \u201cbullying\u201d.\n\nIndian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) said separately on Thursday it was examining the impact of the U.S. sanctions on its chartering of a tanker owned by one of the designated COSCO subsidiaries.\n\nShipping sources said up to 50 tankers could be affected by the sanctions imposed on the various entities including the COSCO subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cLosing that many tankers overnight has led to a scramble for ships in an already tight market and rates have jumped,\u201d one of the shipping sources said.\n\nAnother source added: \u201cShips are getting cancelled and then replaced at extortionate rates.\u201d\n\nSupertanker rates on the benchmark Middle East Gulf to China route soared to their highest level in over nine months on Thursday, with average earnings reaching $46,578 a day, Baltic Exchange data showed.\n\nTanker rates from the U.S. Gulf to China also jumped and reached $45,488 a day on Thursday - their highest level on the route since Baltic data was first published on the route in March of this year.\n\nThe new sanctions so far did not provide any details on the specific ships affected, which was adding to complications with chartering ships, the sources said.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the maximum pressure being placed on Iran which is having side effects on the wider tanker market,\u201d another source said.\n\nSources have said a disruption in global oil flows following attacks on Saudi Arabian oil installations had left U.S. crude exporters without enough tankers to cover rising demand for cargoes.\n\nThey added that Unipec had sought to step up U.S. shipments in recent weeks since the Sept. 14 attacks on state-owned Saudi Aramco\u2019s facilities.", "description": "China's Unipec has made replacement bookings for four oil shipments from the Middle East Gulf after the United States imposed sanctions on the tanker subsidiaries of China's COSCO, three shipping sources said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Jonathan Saul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
