(Photo: Dyson)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nIn the vacuum world, Dysons are probably the most coveted. They're known for powerful suction, great battery life, and their sleek design. But they typically come with a high price tag to match. But right now, you can get an extra 20% off Dyson vacuums, hair dryers, and air purifiers at eBay with the code JOBDONE. These products are already discounted, so they're a steal with this sale.\n\nMany of these items are refurbished, but they're sold directly by Dyson, meaning they've been inspected by the company and should perform like new. Otherwise, you're covered by the 12-month Dyson Official Guarantee, so you can return it if it doesn't perform to your liking.\n\nPretty much any Dyson is a good choice, but we're particularly excited about the V8 Absolute being available for $360 (that's $90 in savings). It's one of our favorite cordless stick vacuums because it's lightweight and comes with a ton of attachments for all of your cleaning needs. If you want to save even more, you can get the refurbished model for just $240. You can also save big on a refurbished V6 Handheld Vacuum, which is a similar version of the best handheld vacuum we've ever tested.\n\nAside from vacuums, you can get a refurbished Supersonic Hair Dryer for just $224. This may seem like a lot, but this super-popular hair dryer typically retails at $400 and is one of the best hair dryers we've ever tested. The fancy heater air purifier combo called the Pure Hot + Cool HP04 is also down $150 from its insane $750 price tag. If you've been eyeing it, it's a good time to snag it.\n\nThe sale only goes until Friday, October 18, so you have limited time to grab the vacuum of your dreams at a great time. Plus, this sale is also the perfect time to a good gift for anyone obsessed with Dyson products.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
