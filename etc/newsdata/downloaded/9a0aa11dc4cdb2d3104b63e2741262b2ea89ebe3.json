Kennedy International Airport \u2015 saying he was held for three hours last month while Customs and Border Protection officers asked him whether he knew any terrorists.\n\nOn Friday, the North Jersey Record reported that Prospect Park Mayor Mohamed Khairullah says he was detained at Kennedy for three hours in August and questioned by CBP officials. He was returning from Turkey, where he\u2019d visited relatives with his wife and four children and met with the mayors of various towns.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a hurtful moment where I\u2019m thinking in my mind that this is not the America that I know,\u201d Khairullah, who has served as Prospect Park\u2019s mayor since 2006, told the paper. \u201cI am very familiar with our laws and Constitution, and everything that was going on there was a violation.\u201d\n\nAhmed Mohamed, litigation director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations\u2019 New York chapter, told HuffPost the CPB agents asked Khairullah about a variety of matters, including his occupation, his mother\u2019s name, his time in Turkey, and whether he met with any terrorist organizations there.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no evidence how this type of questioning, how religious profiling in this manner, protects our country a single bit,\u201d Mohamed said, calling it a \u201cvery classic case of profiling that Muslim travelers have been going through\u201d for years.\n\nAccording to CBP\u2019s website, \u201cagents must develop particularly probable cause to conduct a lawful search.\u201d However, there is room for subjectivity, as the site says \u201cprobable cause can be developed from agent observations,\u201d among other things.\n\nIn Khairullah\u2019s case, his cellphone was seized for 12 days, presenting a potential constitutional violation.\n\nCAIR is now looking into the matter, and deciding whether to follow up with CBP. A major issue, Mohamed said, is whether agents downloaded the contents of the phone.\n\n\u201cNot only is it a constitutional violation of the mayor\u2019s rights, but that\u2019s going to turn into a continuing violation,\u201d Mohamed said, noting that if information was copied from the device, Khairullah could be questioned in subsequent instances.\n\n\u201cThe next time you travel after they\u2019ve downloaded your cellphone is they\u2019re going to ask you about contents they\u2019ve found in your emails,\u201d Mohamed said, as an example.\n\nIn a statement to the Record, a CBP spokesman defended the agency, saying it \u201ctreats all international travelers with integrity, respect and professionalism while keeping the highest standards of security.\u201d The spokesman said he could not comment on individual cases.\n\nKhairullah did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Mohamed said the mayor is \u201cgoing to fight for this to make sure that other Americans don\u2019t have their rights violated.\u201d", "description": "Mohamed Khairullah says Customs and Border Protection agents held him for three hours and confiscated his phone for nearly two weeks.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7c01b8240000d32679a909.jpeg?cache=v8zqscndjw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
