The ruse was revealed by Australian academic Tessa Morris-Suzuki after she was asked to write an article on anti-China a rhetoric for a local politics and foreign affairs blog.\n\nWhen an online search for Vara threw nothing up, she contacted Harvard and discovered the university had no record of him. She then realised that Ron Vara was an anagram of Navarro and contacted the economist and his associates.", "description": "Donald Trump's top China adviser regularly quotes a made-up expert whose name is an anagram of his own surname, it has emerged.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur", "Allister Heath", "Fraser Nelson", "Jacob Rees-Mogg", "Madeline Grant", "Iain Duncan Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/06/TELEMMGLPICT000199097271-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqCceMXJtaZGMG8GkK7K3ZQkNPDKEzApT6aoLqLIUSTA8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
