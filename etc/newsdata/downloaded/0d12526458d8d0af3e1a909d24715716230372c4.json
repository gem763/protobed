Both Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon have been trialled as Daniel Ricciardo's replacement this year.\n\n\"Last year, we were able to test two different setups on Friday, then pick the best one and go in a certain direction,\" Verstappen explained.\n\n\"But if you have a rookie, you cannot expect him to work on the setup right from the start. He first has to familiarise himself with the track.\n\n\"Currently, it's often up to me to try different things with limited track time.\"\n\nBut Verstappen said that's not the only problem.\n\n\"This year was a bit more difficult for us, maybe also because of the new front wing.
