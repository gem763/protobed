Sounds simple, but decisions over whether and how much to buy can get complicated, and mistakes can be costly.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHere are common mistakes financial planners see:\n\nBuying too much or not enough\n\nNot everyone needs life insurance.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no one else depending on your income, you probably don\u2019t need much or any at all,\u201d says Alyssa Lum, certified financial planner and founder of Luminate Financial Planning in Sterling, Virginia.\n\nBut those with young children will need a lot. For breadwinners, a rule of thumb is at least seven times your annual salary, plus money to pay off debt and fund college. \u201cThose dollars really add up,\u201d Lum says.\n\nStay-at-home parents don\u2019t need as much, but should have some coverage, says Greg Klingler, a certified financial planner and director of wealth management for the Government Employees\u2019 Benefits Association. Buy enough to cover child care and other services that the stay-at-home parent provides.\n\nBuying the wrong policy\n\nThere are two main types of life insurance: term and permanent.\n\nTerm life insurance is simple, cheap and offers coverage for a certain period, such as 10, 20 or 30 years. It pays out if the policyholder dies during that term.\n\nPermanent life insurance, such as whole life, lasts your entire life and includes a savings component called cash value, which grows slowly over many years. You can borrow against the cash value or surrender the policy for the cash. It\u2019s more complicated and expensive than term life. It also nets the highest commission for insurance agents.\n\nTerm life is the best choice for most families, Klingler says, because \u201cmost people are going to have a finite need.\u201d Term life can cover you while the kids are growing up or you\u2019re paying off debt, such as a mortgage. Ideally, at the end of the term, you don\u2019t need life insurance anymore.\n\nYet some people get talked into permanent policies when they all they need is term life, says Jason Speciner, a certified financial planner in Fort Collins, Colorado. Building cash value inside a policy can sound appealing, but fees and the agent\u2019s commission eat away at returns.\n\nInstead of pouring money into a permanent policy, max out savings in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. If there\u2019s money left over for long-term investing, a low-cost index fund will probably produce better returns than life insurance, he says.\n\n\u201cIn most cases the old saying, \u2018buy term and invest the difference,\u2019 makes sense,\u201d Speciner says.\n\nPermanent life insurance can be an important estate planning tool for those who have a lifelong financial dependent, such as a child with special needs, or whose estate is big enough to incur taxes for heirs. (Only estates over $11.18 million for an individual and $22.36 million for a couple are subject to federal estate taxes in 2018.)\n\nPutting off the purchase\n\nIt\u2019s easier to put off buying life insurance than think about how your death would affect others. \u201cBut that\u2019s a pretty risky gamble, especially if you have small kids,\u201d says Michael Kelley, a certified financial planner in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nWorried about the cost? It might be cheaper than you think. Most consumers overestimate the price of term life insurance by more than three times, according to a 2018 study by industry groups Life Happens and LIMRA. The study was based on a survey of about 2,000 adults who are household financial decision-makers. The actual cost of a 20-year, $250,000 term life policy for a healthy, 30-year-old nonsmoker is about $160 a year, the study says.\n\nCompare quotes from at least a few companies to find the best rates.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nRelying on free life insurance at work\n\nLife insurance benefits through work probably aren\u2019t enough for those who have a family depending on their income, Speciner says.\n\nThat coverage is typically one to two times your annual salary \u2014 not enough to sustain a family after the loss of a breadwinner. Another drawback: The coverage usually ends when an employee leaves the company.\n\nBuy your own policy if you need life insurance, and consider the free benefits from work a bonus.\n\nMore From NerdWallet:\n\nAnswer 5 Questions Before Buying Life Insurance at Work\n\nDoes Bundling Insurance Mean You\u2019ll Save a Bundle?
