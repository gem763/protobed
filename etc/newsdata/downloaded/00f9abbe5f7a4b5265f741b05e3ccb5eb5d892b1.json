USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2013 In his year and a half as a Houston Astro, Roberto Osuna has been a capable if unremarkable closer, saving 38 games this year and 50 overall, a useful cog on a team of superstars and MVPs.\n\nAnd then a high-ranking club official had to remind the fan base that while Osuna has done all the Astros have asked, the franchise still has a long way to go in comprehending domestic violence.\n\nAssistant general manager Brandon Taubman\u2019s expletive-filled tirade directed at female reporters in the wake of the Astros\u2019 pennant-winning victory in the American League Championship Series was framed as a defense of the closer, but instead unintentionally highlighted the fact Osuna served a 75-game suspension last season after he allegedly assaulted the mother of his then-three-year-old child.\n\nThe Astros\u2019 response \u2013 clumsy at best, toxic at worst \u2013 managed to keep the story in public view all the way up to Tuesday night\u2019s Game 1 of the World Series, nearly three nights after Osuna blew the Game 6 ALCS save that apparently fueled Taubman\u2019s tirade.\n\nFor Astros fans, Osuna\u2019s past transgressions and Taubman\u2019s outburst haven\u2019t quite created a moral dilemma. The event has, however, forced many to dig deep for a sentiment landing somewhere on the spectrum between tolerance and forgiveness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not judging the man,\u201d Shelly Bordonaro, a 57-year-old fan from Port Arthur said of Taubman. \"I\u2019m just saying what he said was tasteless. We all make mistakes.\n\n\u201cBut you have to be careful what you say.\u201d\n\nOf a dozen-plus Astros fans queried before Game 1, none indicated their enjoyment of a second championship in three years would be in any way dulled by Osuna being at the bottom of a celebratory pile after recording the final out.\n\nThey minced few words regarding Taubman.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many good people on the Astros,\u201d says Rebel Prestwood, who commuted from Bridge City for the game. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a reflection on the team.\u201d\n\nLora Liberty, a 35-year-old from The Woodlands, played softball collegiately and said compartmentalizing Osuna\u2019s past was \u201cnot about the player; it\u2019s about the team. I\u2019ve played softball my whole life, and I know what it\u2019s like to be a team player.\u201d\n\nThe hundreds of jerseys and shirseys hugging the backs of fans filing through the concourse represented a diverse cross-section of their heroes: Correa, Springer, Bregman, Altuve \u2013 so many Altuves \u2013 along with newer, shinier models touting relative newcomers Michael Brantley and Yordan Alvarez.\n\nOver a 90-minute period, there were no Osunas to be found, perhaps a reflection that the fan base merely tolerates, but does not celebrate, their closer.", "description": "The Astros\u2019 response managed to keep the story in public view all the way up to Tuesday night\u2019s Game 1 of the World Series.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
