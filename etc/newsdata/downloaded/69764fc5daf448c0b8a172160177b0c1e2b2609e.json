It is simply a case of put up with it and if you do not like it tough!'\n\nThe Chelsea Supporters' Trust have also voiced their displeasure: 'These fixtures are five days late. This impacts on family arrangements, the price of train tickets, the ability to book leave and much more.\n\nSky and BT Sport have yet to announce with fixtures will be televised over the festive period\n\nThe TV fixtures for December and January should have been released five days ago\n\n'It is especially sensitive over Christmas, when match-going fans already have challenges regarding fitting in with family arrangements.'\n\nWhile the Newcastle United Supporters' Trust writes: 'Due to our geography, Newcastle fans naturally end up paying way more on average to follow their team on the road.\n\n'The longer we wait for confirmation of away fixtures, the more expensive the trip becomes.\n\n'Throw Christmas into the mix, naturally a busier and more expensive time of year, and some fans are faced with a huge financial burden if they want to follow their team away from home thanks to yet another delay.'", "description": "The TV selections from Sky Sports and BT Sport for December and January were due to be published earlier this month but are currently five days late.", "authors": ["James Dutton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/13/19786514-0-image-a-5_1571228713126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
