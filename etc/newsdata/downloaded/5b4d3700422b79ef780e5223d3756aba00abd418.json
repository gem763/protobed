Shahs of Sunset star Golnesa Gharachedaghi, known as GG, revealed the exciting news that she is expecting her first child to People Magazine on Friday\n\n'This is what I wanted my entire life,' GG gushed to People. 'When little girls were talking about their perfect husband and their perfect weddings, I was talking about the 10 kids I was going to have.'\n\nThe reality star explained that she'd always had the goal of becoming a mom on her mind and will emulate her own mother as a parent.\n\n'I'm finally at this point where I'm ready to make this move. I can't wait to give this child a life of unconditional love without judgment, the same way my mom has shown me my whole life.'\n\nIn August, GG completed a successful round of in vitro fertilization with sperm from a donor but the road to conception was not an easy one for her.\n\n'This is what I wanted my entire life,' GG gushed to People. 'When little girls were talking about their perfect husband and their perfect weddings, I was talking about the 10 kids I was going to have.'\n\nThe first round of IVF lead to an ectopic pregnancy, or a pregnancy outside of the uterus, and the complication required the removal of both of her Fallopian tubes in an emergency surgery.\n\n'What I went through a couple of months ago is so traumatizing,' she said. 'Right now, it's still very scary for me.'\n\nThe entrepreneur said she knew at the time that something was wrong with the pregnancy.\n\n'I would freak out and say, \"Something doesn't feel right to me,\" and my doctors would calm me down, like, \"It's normal. Your uterus is making space for the baby. Lots of pregnant women have spotting. You've never been pregnant before, this happens.\"'\n\nModern medicine: GG explained that she decided to go it alone with having a baby as a single mom after she split from her husband in 2018. GG conceived via IVF and a sperm donor in August (Pictured with her ex Shalom)\n\nUltimately it seemed that GG knew her body best and after five weeks she discovered that the pregnancy was ectopic and not viable.\n\n'It was an ectopic pregnancy,' she recalled. 'The only option was to terminate it \u2014 in my case, through the distribution of a very strong drug called methotrexate.'\n\n'That was probably the most traumatizing moment of my life,' Gharachedaghi admits. 'Literally, just a couple of days before, I was celebrating. And now, I was mourning.'\n\nGG turned to an anonymous donor to father the child after she split from her husband Shalom Yeroushalmi last year.\n\n'This is what I wanted my entire life,' GG gushed to People. 'When little girls were talking about their perfect husband and their perfect weddings, I was talking about the 10 kids I was going to have.'\n\n'I heard about a really good donor concierge company, who scavenges through the data from all the sperm banks in the nation and some neighboring countries to find you what you're looking for,' the star explained.\n\nShe called the IVF process time consuming but 'amazing' and detailed how she looked through elaborate profiles filled with information like the genetic background for the man and his family.\n\nGG said: 'I hate to joke about it, but you know the Build-A-Bear Workshop? It's almost like that, but it's a human. Build-A-Baby!'\n\nThe star told People that she is ready to parent solo and will be leaning heavily on her mom, with whom she is quite close.\n\nTough road: The 36-year-old successfully conceived following a traumatic Ectopic pregnancy that lead to her Fallopian tubes being removed (GG pictured in season seven of Shahs)\n\n'We're in a day and age that women are so much more independent, and we're not necessarily relying on men in order to move forward in life. I can start a family and have my child without being in a relationship right now.'\n\nIn the future, GG said she was open to the idea of a relationship but wasn't interested in getting married again.\n\nGG is set to return for season eight of Shahs of Sunset on Bravo sometime in the near future but an exact premiere date has yet to be released.", "description": "Shahs of Sunset star Golnesa Gharachedaghi, known as GG, revealed the exciting news that she is expecting her first child to People Magazine on Friday.", "authors": ["Caitlyn Becker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/19/19310004-0-image-a-5_1570213112303.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
