Schiff, D-Calif., published the details of the complaint Thursday morning, just minutes before opening a contentious hearing over acting Director of National Intelligence Maguire\u2019s role in handling the complaint since it landed on his desk in late August.\n\nAccording to national security experts and former National Security Council officials, including those who served under Trump, the decision to relocate the call transcripts \u2014 whose specific contents are not typically highly sensitive \u2014 is extremely abnormal and not in line with how the system is meant to be used.\n\nPresident Trump (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters, Getty Images) More\n\nThe secret database \u201cis used to retain and preserve the most sensitive compartmented intelligence matters. That would include covert action programs \u2014 in my time there that would have included info on the RDI program, for example,\u201d said Larry Pfeiffer, director of George Mason University\u2019s Michael V. Hayden Center, referring to the CIA\u2019s controversial rendition and interrogation program.\n\n\u201cIt may also hold diplomatically sensitive information \u2014 such as the information surrounding the very sensitive negotiations and conversations involving Oman in the very early stages of negotiating the nuclear agreement with Iran,\u201d said Pfeiffer, who ran the White House situation room for a number of years under President Barack Obama. Pfeiffer also served in the intelligence community in a number of different roles, including as former CIA and National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden\u2019s chief of staff and as a signals intelligence analyst at the NSA.\n\n\u201cIt would never be used to protect or \u2018lock down\u2019 politically sensitive material or to protect the president or senior officials from embarrassment,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m appalled at this clear abuse of the president\u2019s power to manage and protect our most sensitive secrets.\u201d\n\nSamantha Vinograd, a former official at the National Security Council under Obama, also publicly criticized the use of the highly classified system. Transcripts would likely be moved there only if they were so sensitive they contained \u201ccodeword\u201d information \u2014 information so sensitive that only officials who have been cleared at the highest level and for that specific code word have access to it, she explained Thursday morning in a series of tweets.\n\n\u201cThat separate system is not intended to hide evidence of a crime,\u201d she wrote in a tweet.\n\nA former NSC official who served under Trump and asked not to be named to speak freely said the decision to store the transcripts in such a way would have been the likely result of either an extreme effort to prevent leaks or, more worryingly, an attempt to \u201cbury\u201d the details of the call.", "description": "The decision to move records of President Trump\u2019s calls with foreign officials to a highly sensitive and protected computer system was highly unusual and likely inappropriate, experts say.", "authors": ["Jenna Mclaughlin", "National Security", "Investigations Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LriWHpgmIwyUYOa99DImpg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/32148020-e084-11e9-9ef3-3d0529ba03cc", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
