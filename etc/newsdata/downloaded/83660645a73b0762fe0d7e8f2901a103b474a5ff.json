REUTERS/Neil Hall\n\nBritain\u2019s economy unexpectedly shrank in the second quarter and economists forecast it will only achieve modest growth during the three months to September, as exporters face pressure from the trade conflict between the United States and China.\n\nSo far consumer demand has stayed solid according to official data, contrasting with business investment which has ground to a halt ahead of the risk of a disruptive no-deal departure from the European Union on Oct. 31.\n\nThe CBI said the headline sales number of its monthly distributive trades survey rose to -16 in September from a 10-year low of -49 in August, a somewhat bigger rebound than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nThe gauge of orders placed with suppliers rose to -9 from -59, but stores still judged that sales were poor for the time of year, with this measure dropping to -11 from -6.\n\n\u201cAdd to this the pressures of sterling depreciation and the need to plan for potential tariffs and supply issues in the event of a no-deal Brexit and you get a gloomy picture for the sector,\u201d CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.\n\nIn recent months, the CBI data has been more downbeat than official figures and data from the British Retail Consortium.\n\nAugust data from the Office for National Statistics - which includes a wider range of retailers than the CBI survey - showed that sales volumes were up 2.7% on a year earlier.\n\n\u201cThe CBI\u2019s survey repeatedly has pointed to a retail apocalypse this year that has not occurred,\u201d Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019s Samuel Tombs said.\n\nThe weak survey data probably reflected high-street stores\u2019 difficulty adapting to online competition, he added.\n\nNonetheless, there have been some recent signs that consumers\u2019 mood may be darkening. A monthly survey by IHS Markit showed on Monday that households were the most downbeat about the outlook for their finances in nearly six years - though a strong job market boosted overall sentiment.\n\nAnd earlier on Wednesday figures from trade body UK Finance showed credit card lending growth slowed in August to its weakest since February 2015.\n\n\u201cConsumer caution may be increasing,\u201d economist Howard Archer of consultants EY Item Club said, adding that households could be less keen on borrowing more now given political and economic uncertainty ahead, and reduced credit availability.", "description": "British retail sales fell for a fifth straight month in September, the Confederation of British Industry said on Wednesday, and credit card lending data also pointed to a possible softening in consumer demand ahead of Brexit.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433708506&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0NM", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
