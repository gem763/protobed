The session lasted about a minute. When Brown was asked about his standing with the league, given the pending civil lawsuit in which a former trainer accused him of sexual assault, Brown offered cliches about Bill Belichick and Tom Brady.\n\nIf you needed any proof that Brown has been fully indoctrinated into The Patriot Way, it\u2019s all there in the one-minute clip above.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAntonio Brown meets with media for one minute\n\nBrown didn\u2019t have much to say on Thursday, and the Patriots made sure his media session wrapped up before he did say anything interesting. It\u2019s surprising he didn\u2019t drop a \u201cI\u2019m just here so I won\u2019t get fined.\u201d\n\nBrown answered four questions, but answered the first one like he misheard it. He was asked about his standing with the league.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super grateful to be here,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThankful to Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. I\u2019ve got a lot of the offense to learn and catch up. But I\u2019m excited and grateful to be here.\u201d\n\nThe final question, with a public relations representative cutting off the session, was again about the NFL and whether he\u2019d heard from the league.\n\n\u201cI appreciate that question,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m just here to focus on ball.\u201d\n\nBrown has been quiet so far\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict what will happen next with Brown. We\u2019ve learned that over the past few weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut based on what has happened so far, Brown is adopting the Patriots\u2019 mantra of not saying anything and not being a distraction. He hasn\u2019t tweeted anything since Sept. 7. His last retweet was the Patriots\u2019 announcement on Sept. 10 that they signed him. Brown\u2019s social media habits have gotten him in trouble before, but early on it seems he\u2019s on board with the Patriots\u2019 way of doing things.\n\nAnd based on his media interaction on Thursday, and him leaving the locker room before the media was allowed in last Sunday, there won\u2019t be any long, revealing interviews. The Steelers and Raiders weren\u2019t so lucky.\n\nPatriots receiver Antonio Brown didn't have much to say on Thursday.
