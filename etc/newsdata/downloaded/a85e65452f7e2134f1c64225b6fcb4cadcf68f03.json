Three people were killed when they were struck by teargas canisters, security and medical officials said.\n\nA second medical official said three protesters were shot dead by security guards when they attacked the office of a provincial official in the southern town of Nasiriyah. The town in the mainly Shia south has seen especially violent protests in recent weeks and was placed under a 24-hour curfew on Friday.\n\nAt least 49 people have been killed since the protests resumed this week, after 149 were killed in a wave of demonstrations earlier this month. The spontaneous, leaderless protests are directed at the political establishment that came to power after the 2003 US-led invasion, which many blame for spiralling corruption and poor public services.\n\nThe interior ministry and the military issued statements on Saturday saying some protesters had exploited the rallies to attack government buildings and political party offices.\n\nLocal police and security services said that Iraq\u2019s elite counter-terrorism service had been deployed to Nasiriyah, where they broke up demonstrations by beating and arresting dozens of protesters.\n\nThe Iraqi prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, earlier ordered the unit to be deployed in the streets of Baghdad and use any means to end protests against his government, two security sources told Reuters.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iraqi security forces block the road to the Green Zone.

The military warned that it would take necessary and legal measures to deal with those it called saboteurs.\n\nIraqi officials said 12 of those killed on Friday died in a fire they had set when they stormed the office of a government-backed militia in the southern town of Diwaniyah. A security official said protesters torched the offices of at least three militias in southern Maysan province.\n\nIn Baghdad, Iraqi police had fired teargas, rubber bullets and live shots on Friday to break up protesters who gathered in the central Tahrir Square and later tried to cross the bridge leading to the Green Zone. The protesters returned on Saturday, clashing with security forces throughout the day.\n\nThe rallies have mainly been by young, unemployed men who are demanding jobs and better services. Women appeared among the crowd in Baghdad for the first time on Saturday, some of whom handed out water to protesters.\n\nA widow said she had asked her son and daughter to stay at home because she feared for their safety. But the 60-year-old from outside of Baghdad said she came to protest, wanting a better future for her children. Her husband died in Iraq\u2019s eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid if I die, but I want a better future for my children,\u201d she said. \u201cIf these parties and this government stay, they will have no future.\u201d\n\nIran emerged as a major power broker in Iraq after the 2003 invasion and has close ties to many of its most powerful political parties. It also backs a number of militias that were mobilised in 2014 to battle the Islamic State group.", "description": "Protesters were trying to reach the capital\u2019s heavily fortified Green Zone", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d501093d150a780d07fa2db05afc1925af39113e/0_36_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d0921a089a3c719a12536b02916b2eb", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
