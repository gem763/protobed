REUTERS/Phil Noble/Files\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said Salazar\u2019s punishment was for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d as head coach of the Nike Oregon Project (NOP), a camp designed primarily to develop U.S. endurance athletes.\n\nAfter the ban was announced, the U.S. Track and Field Federation (USATF) removed Salazar\u2019s accreditation for the world athletics championships in Doha.\n\nSalazar said he would appeal USADA\u2019s decision, and sportswear giant Nike said in a statement that it would stand by him.\n\n\u201cI am shocked by the outcome today,\u201d Salazar said in a statement. \u201cMy athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from USADA.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping. I will appeal and look forward to this unfair and protracted process reaching the conclusion I know to be true. I will not be commenting further at this time.\u201d\n\nUSADA said that Salazar, who also coached American Olympian Matthew Centrowitz among other top distance runners, trafficked banned performance-enhancing substance testosterone to multiple athletes.\n\nSalazar also tampered or attempted to tamper with NOP athletes\u2019 doping control process, the agency said after concluding its four-year investigation.\n\nJeffrey Brown, who worked as a paid consultant endocrinologist for NOP on performance enhancement and served as a physician for numerous athletes in the training program, also received a four-year ban.\n\nSeveral members of NOP are competing in the 2019 IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar.\n\nNone of the athletes Salazar has worked with were mentioned in Monday\u2019s report.\n\nSalazar stopped coaching Farah in 2017 when the runner decided to move back to England. Farah said at the time that the doping investigation was not the reason they parted ways.\n\n\u201cThe athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,\u201d Travis Tygart, USADA chief executive officer, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar and Dr. Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nSalazar said that Tygart\u2019s comment was misleading and he had never put winning above the athletes\u2019 safety.\n\n\u201cThis is completely false and contrary to the findings of the arbitrators, who even wrote about the care I took in complying with the World Anti-Doping code,\u201d he said.\n\nNike, which funds NOP, the nation\u2019s most elite long-distance running training center in Portland under a $460 million, 26-year sponsorship deal with US Track and Field, said it would support Salazar\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision had nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete. As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti-Doping code,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cNike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner.\u201d\n\nSalazar, 61, was a celebrated distance runner, winning three consecutive New York City marathons starting in 1980.", "description": "Leading American athletics coach Alberto Salazar, who has coached some of the world's top distance runners including British Olympic track champion Mo Farah, has been banned for four years for doping violations.", "authors": ["Gene Cherry", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435815881&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902AI", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
