But thankfully each year Joan\u2019s four sons and daughter help her get through it.\n\nThis year, on what would have been Joan and Harry\u2019s 15th anniversary, their 25-year-old son, Joe, went a step further.\n\nHe decided to send his mum a wedding anniversary card as if it had been written by her late husband.\n\nJoe bought an anniversary card and worked hard to make sure his words sounded like Harry, writing: \u201915 years just like that! Where has the time went?\n\n\u2018Happy anniversary to you darling. You know everyday I\u2019m with you, maybe not physically but in spirit and not a day goes past that I\u2019m not.\n\nThe card Joe sent to his mum on what would have been her 15th wedding anniversary (Picture: Sophie Newell-Brown/Deadline News)\n\n\u2018With how you have been and even in general. Just wow I married a soldier, you\u2019re so strong and supporting even on your down days, but never worry as I\u2019m always here with you through it all. You\u2019re never alone!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Happy 15th anniversary Joan. I love you. Harry (plus the kids) xxx..\u2019\n\nJoe\u2019s sister Sophie, 22, shared the card online, writing: \u2018My dad passed away two months before their first wedding anniversary meaning my mum\u2019s never received anything on their anniversary apart from us.\n\nThe post has gone viral, attracting loads of comments from people touched by the moving gesture.\n\nDemi Grant wrote: \u2018Actual sobbing, that\u2019s the nicest thing.\u2019\n\nJoe and Sophie (Picture: Sophie Newell-Brown/Deadline News)\n\nSame, Demi.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, Joan had an emotional reaction to the card, too.\n\nSophie said: \u2018She was always grateful to my older brothers taking care of her. Joe tried to make the day even more special for her.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no dry eyes in the house at the moment.\n\n\u2018His writing was very similar to dad\u2019s so that must have been very difficult for her. She was just so thankful.\u2019\n\nMORE: Dementia sufferer\u2019s face lights up as she sees husband on their 72nd wedding anniversary\n\nMORE: Bride and groom who met through running replace wedding dance with a 5k\n\nMORE: Seven-year-old\u2019s glorious drawing of wedding cake leaves mum in hysterics\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Joan Newell-Brown, 59, lost her husband Harry in a car accident in 2005, just 10 months after they married.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90601618_1571483053.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
