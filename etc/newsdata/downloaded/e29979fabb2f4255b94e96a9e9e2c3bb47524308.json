No. They're projecting a recession subject to a possible trade war. Where is it?\" he told reporters on the sidelines of the conference.\n\n\"Do you really believe that the US and China and those other countries involved in this issue would not have the wisdom and sensibility to try and overcome these issues?\"", "description": "Saudi Arabia's Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman brought some humour to his debut as the kingdom's new oil minister Monday, joking that the industry outlook could drive him to take Prozac if he took it seriously.
