Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nWhen Instagram first hit the news this week, it was over a hoax. A host of celebrities had posted to their timelines a battered image declaring that Instagram would soon make our deleted photos and messages public, and use them against us in court, unless we created a post to the contrary. It wasn\u2019t true, of course, but it seemed true enough to some of our biggest stars \u2014 such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mother, and the man responsible for our nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe digital content industry debunked the copypasta, celebrities posted sheepish apologies (or didn\u2019t), and we all resumed waiting for the next dumb thing to come along and briefly preoccupy us between stories about the burning rainforest in the Amazon and the president\u2019s effort to buy Greenland (?).\n\nWhy do people fall for hoaxes like these, which have been around for the better part of a decade? In Wired, Paris Martineau talks to a behavioral scientist who explains that social media is making us dumber:\n\n\u201cThe brain is set up to give us easy answers \u2026 so if there\u2019s a hoax that appeals to people\u2019s emotions or intuition, it\u2019s going to trick people, because a lot of people just don\u2019t spend that much time thinking about the things that they see on social media,\u201d says Gordon Pennycook, an assistant professor of behavioral science at the University of Regina in Canada who studies decision making. \u201cSocial media is partly to blame, too, because it\u2019s set up to drive engagement, and that engagement often comes at the cost of shutting off people\u2019s brains a little bit.\u201d\n\nAt the New York Times, John Herrman takes the opposite view. The terms of service for every social network amount to little more than a nonsense incantation, he writes \u2014 Instagram users this week were merely fighting fire with fire:\n\nAll the big social apps explain themselves to us this way. The same services we use to spread false information depend on web of rules that are so rarely read, and a set of \u201cagreements\u201d that are so cartoonishly lopsided, they may as well be made up. Online, we live in a world defined and ruled by what feel like magic words. What else are we supposed to post about?\n\nI\u2019m with Herrman.\n\nIn any case, there have been some changes to Instagram lately \u2014 they\u2019re just not the ones the secretary of energy is worried about. In a revealing new report in The Information, Alex Heath recounts the 11 months since Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger left their creation in the hands of Mark Zuckerberg and his deputy, Adam Mosseri. In his telling, what began as a warm embrace of a fast-growing new business has more lately come to resemble a python\u2019s squeeze. Heath writes:\n\nIn the roughly 11 months since Mosseri took over, most of Instagram\u2019s senior leadership team has been replaced, Facebook has ordered Instagram to roughly double the number of advertisements in the app and the company is weaving together the technical underpinnings of the messaging services behind Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Together the changes send a message that the days of independence at Instagram, whose employees had grown accustomed to their autonomy inside Facebook, are over. The challenge for Mosseri, the well-liked former head of Facebook\u2019s News Feed who has worked at the company for more than a decade, is to stabilize the organization behind Instagram, an app many inside and outside Facebook see as the company\u2019s most promising source of future growth. If the exodus of longtime Instagram employees continues, there is a risk Facebook will lose the talent that made the app special in the first place.\n\nOn one hand, Instagram really is going quite well. The division hit $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2016, Heath reports, and is expected to generate $15.8 billion this year. That\u2019s nearly a quarter of Facebook\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nOn the other hand, Instagram is bleeding ... Instagram-ness. As I wrote when it was first reported that Facebook planned to create a single back end for all its services, Instagram has become little more than a name: a public-facing brand represented behind the scenes by true-believing Facebook employees. That sounds obvious today, but it still represents a huge departure from where Instagram was a year ago today: still persuaded of its own uniqueness, clinging to vestiges of its independence from the mainland.\n\nAnd what has replaced Instagram\u2019s old values? Well, there\u2019s that doubling of the ad load, for starters, which as a user I\u2019ve been feeling quite acutely lately. (I seem to see one every third flip between stories or so.) There\u2019s the laser focus on shopping, which has the potential to turn vast swathes of the app into a shopping catalog. (Heath reports that the company has shelved a planned standalone shopping app, whose existence I revealed last year.)\n\nBut mostly there\u2019s just Facebook, wherever you look. It\u2019s in the executive ranks, which now consist primarily of Facebook imports. It\u2019s in the employee email addresses, which have moved over to fb.com It\u2019s in the \u201cInstagram from Facebook\u201d language that now adorns the settings page.\n\nFacebook clearly accelerated Instagram\u2019s rise, giving it invaluable promotion for years. But the more I look at the vise grip Facebook has its most prized acquisition in today, the more I wonder whether the company can be as beneficial to Instagram in the future as it was in the past.\n\nSubscribe to The Interface by email.\n\nPushback\n\nYesterday we talked about some research suggesting new approaches to reduce extremism online. A paper from researchers at George Washington University and the University of Miami suggested focusing on smaller clusters of hate speech, banning random samples of users over time rather than all at once, recruiting volunteers to argue with hate clusters in public, and pitting hate clusters with differing ideologies against one another to sap them of their energy.\n\nI asked y\u2019all to tell me what you made of these ideas, and I think it\u2019s fair to say you strongly disliked them.\n\nIn one of the largest responses I\u2019ve gotten to a newsletter yet, you told me that these ideas were misguided or impractical. Some choice quotes from readers:\n\n\u201cThese techniques sound absurd to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel that this policy will only create more polarization. Either by escalating the antagonistic debate online between hate groups and anti-hate groups, or by the fact that these hate groups will eventually discover the little trick that the \u201cbig cats\u201d had established to hush them.\u201c\n\n\u201dAren\u2019t steps #3 and #4 what the Internet Research Agency did during the 2016 election?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese folks have repeatedly proved resistant to goodwill, appeals to morality, and common sense \u2014 to me they\u2019re common criminals. Even the hardiest of souls would have their hands full trying to begin to crack these tough nuts \u2014 the least recalcitrant of their number would never listen.\u201d\n\nAh well. Perhaps we\u2019ll find a more satisfying answer in the next paper on the subject.\n\nDemocracy\n\n\u2b50 YouTube disabled 210 accounts that coordinated to weaken Hong Kong protests. Finally! But note that Google, like Facebook, does not specifically finger the Chinese government as the entity behind the campaign. (Chris Welch / The Verge)\n\nGoogle just published a blog post revealing that it has disabled 210 YouTube channels that the company says \u201cbehaved in a coordinated manner while uploading videos related to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.\u201d Google cites the behavior as being \u201cconsistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by Facebook and Twitter.\u201d The accounts were disabled earlier this week. Both Facebook and Twitter recently uncovered and suspended accounts that the social media companies believe were operated by the Chinese government and designed to seed doubt about and undermine the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. Twitter suspended nearly 1,000 accounts tied to China, and Facebook removed various pages, groups, and accounts linked to the effort to spread information opposing the protests. \u201cWe found use of VPNs and other methods to disguise the origin of these accounts and other activity commonly associated with coordinated influence operations,\u201d Shane Huntley, from Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, wrote in the blog post. \u201cThese actions are part of our continuing efforts to protect the integrity of our platforms and the security and privacy of our users.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook reported new evidence of inauthentic activity in Myanmar, and removed dozens of pages, groups, and accounts. They had a collective 900,000 followers.\n\nNew research suggests that putting warning labels on stories shared to Facebook that fact-checkers have found to be false actually does discourage people from sharing them.

The wait can be endless, and the inability to contact a Facebook employee maddening. Increasingly agitated, Facebook castaways turn for help to Twitter, Reddit, Quora, message boards and, well, me. Because I have a history of writing about (and sometimes solving) people\u2019s troubles with the platform, profoundly addicted Facebook users have found their way to my inbox, emailing multiple times a day for updates about their cases, which I do not have. [\u2026] It\u2019s possible that users like Mr. Reeves and Ms. May were caught up in the sweep. But the number of people complaining about disabled Facebook accounts has been going up for years, according to data from the Federal Trade Commission, which tracked three such complaints in 2015, 12 in 2016, and more than 50 in each of the last two years.\n\nMark Zuckerberg sold $296 million worth of Facebook shares this monthas part of regularly scheduled stock sales.

And yet somehow News Corp.\u2019s proposed solution, now in development, is just completely hilarious to me:\n\nThe service, currently called Knewz.com, is expected to be a website and a mobile app. An early version is being shown to a small group of News Corp executives and an official launch could come later this year, though no specific timeline has been set, the people said. The company could still decide not to proceed with the project, they said. [\u2026] The project aims to give exposure to smaller outlets that News Corp executives believe are often demoted in Google\u2019s search results and Facebook\u2019s social feed, the people said. That includes publishers with conservative audiences such as the Daily Wire, the Daily Caller, the Washington Free Beacon and the Washington Examiner, according to some of the people. Others said the idea is to highlight deserving news stories, regardless of politics, noting that progressive sites such as Daily Kos and ThinkProgress are included.\n\nSo it\u2019s Gab, but for Google News.
