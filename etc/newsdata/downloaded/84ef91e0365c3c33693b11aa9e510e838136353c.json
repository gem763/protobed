Is this because women are naturally more cautious?\n\nName: The confidence gap.\n\nBetween? Men and women, obvs.\n\nAh, that old chestnut. It is old, right? Age: Since the very beginning.\n\nGenesis? You better Adam\u2019n\u2019Eve it. Unless you don\u2019t, and perhaps believe in something else, such as science.\n\nHang on, though, wasn\u2019t it Eve who had the cojones to take a bite out of the apple first? Well, yes, but I\u2019m not sure that story is really about confidence and gender.\n\nBut this is, so there are other, better examples, right? Er, yes. Look around you, your work, your family, public life, isn\u2019t it obvious? And it\u2019s not just anecdotal; countless studies have found that men overestimate their abilities and performance, while women underestimate both.\n\nIsn\u2019t that because men are better ... Joke! Not funny. Not true. They might (do) think they are, but performances do not differ in quality.\n\nAnd this being Pass notes, there\u2019s going to be an interesting newsworthy example, isn\u2019t there? What is it this time, that men are more confident about? Aliens. Specifically, meeting them.\n\nOf course it is. Go on then, tell us all about it. A new Oxford University study has found that men are much more likely than women to want to have a close encounter with an extraterrestrial. Two-thirds of men compared with less than half of women. The researchers themselves reflect the difference: astrophysicist Dr Peter Hatfield would be up for reaching out; legal ethics expert Dr Leah Trueblood is not so sure.\n\nUgh, reach out. I hate that expression. Yeah, but that is what you literally do with aliens. Have you not seen ET?\n\nIs Hatfield\u2019s confidence because, being a scientist, he knows there is nothing out there, so he can puff out his chest and display a bit of manly braggadocio? Well, he reckons the chance of making contact with life beyond this planet in the next 100 years is about 10%. Mankind \u2013 humankind \u2013 needs to be prepared.\n\nCould the gap also have something to do with the fact that men are more likely to be idiots? Also possible.\n\nAnything else in the survey? If aliens do show up, then there shouldn\u2019t be a referendum to decide on how humans should proceed.\n\nGod no. And imagine what Farage and his lot would say. Let\u2019s keep him out of this.\n\nWhat about the aliens, would it be the little green men coming bounding down the ladder/beam/whatever while the little green women stayed inside? They didn\u2019t take part in the survey, mainly because of existential uncertainty.\n\nDo say: \u201cHello! Welcome!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cPut the kettle on, love, we\u2019ve got visitors.\u201d", "description": "A new study has found a marked difference between men and women when it comes to the idea of reaching out to extraterrestrials.
