He's done an excellent job with our young defencemen. That's something that's a little bit underrated about him. Those are things you don't see.\n\n\"That's been the exciting part for me \u2014 to watch him continue to grow that way as a leader. We all see the numbers and [the] special company he's in, but he's done an excellent job with our team as a leader.\"\n\nIt's not like Carlson, whose future with the Capitals was up in the air after the Cup win because of salary cap concerns, has come out of nowhere. The Natick, Mass., native had 90 goals and 403 points in 688 games coming into this season, including 70- and 68-point campaigns the last two years.\n\nBut teammates are glad he's finally getting some recognition outside their sphere.\n\n\"He's put up some numbers a few years in a row and [wasn't] one of the Norris candidates,\" Capitals centre Evgeny Kuznetsov said. \"This is the year he's going to prove more and more \u2014 not in this locker room, but prove to [the media] so you can vote for him.\n\n\"He doesn't get talked about around the league.\"\n\nThat's certainly started to change.", "description": "Washington Capitals' John Carlson had an October to remember with seven goals and 16 assists for 23 points in 14 games, just two short of the NHL record for the most points by a defenceman in the first month of a season, set by Al MacInnis in 13 contests back in 1990.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5341705.1572468774!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hkn-capitals-maple-leafs-20191029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
