The actions came after NATO accused Tehran of disobeying European sanctions by exporting the commodity to war-torn Syria.\n\nPlus on Friday, a U.N. atomic watchdog agency reported that Iran is breaching its nuclear deal with world powers by increasing its stock of enriched uranium.\n\n\"I think we're headed more toward escalation,\" said Croft. \"The thing to really watch is if you get a retaliatory cycle. If these Iranian backed groups start targeting, for example, U.S. servicemen In Iraq, and there are about 5,000 U.S. servicemen in Iraq, if anything happens to those servicemen that really is a catalyst for this conflict going kinetic.\"\n\nIt would be a big shift from the oil bear case that has been dominating the market all summer.\n\n\"What has really held oil back have been these trade war concerns, and that his understandable. China is the largest importer of oil,\" said Croft, who has a $52-$59 a barrel year-end price target on WTI crude.\n\nDespite her bullish case, she also outlines a less likely bear case for oil that does involve Iran.\n\nIf Iran stops its attacks and there's a diplomatic breakthrough, Croft warns oil inventory would spike.\n\n\"There are a lot of Iranian barrels that are sitting off this market right now. Two million barrels,\" said Croft. \"That will be a big story in terms of how this market shakes out for the rest of the year.\"\n\nWTI crude prices fell 6% for August. The commodity settled at $55.10 a barrel on Friday \u2014 seeing its best week in seven. However, it's still down about 20% since hitting a 2019 peak in April.\n\nDisclaimer", "description": "RBC Capital Markets' Helima Croft believes Wall Street needs to pay more attention to Iran risks.", "authors": ["Stephanie Landsman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105849423-1555090874496img_9338.jpg?v=1555090913"}
