USA TODAY\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany \u2014 Simone Biles has embraced her greatness.\n\nShe has cemented herself as the best gymnast of her, and every other generation, surpassing what she did in 2016. And like Serena Williams and the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team, she sees no reason to shy away from it.\n\nThat confidence, and her willingness to own all of her emotions, is what she hopes will be her legacy, every bit as much as what she\u2019s done on the floor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to teach our female youth that it\u2019s OK to say, 'Yes, I am good at this,' and you don\u2019t hold back,\u201d Biles said Friday in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY Sports the day after winning her fifth all-around title at the world championships. \u201cYou only see the men doing it. And they\u2019re praised for it and the women are looked down upon for it. But I feel like it\u2019s good (to do) because once you realize you\u2019re confident and good at it, then you\u2019re even better at what you do.\n\nSimone Biles won four gold medals at the Rio Olympics in 2016, and is looking to add to her total next year in Tokyo.

Look at her now.\u2019 No, the facts are literally on the paper. I think it\u2019s important to teach (young girls) that.\u201d\n\nWilliams was one of Biles\u2019 favorite athletes growing up, not only for her dominance but for her willingness to speak out and show emotion. As Biles has gotten older \u2013 she\u2019ll be 23 in March \u2013 she has been increasingly willing to use the platform that her place in the sport affords her.\n\nShe has been a leader in talking about the sexual assault scandal in her sport. USA Gymnastics only stopped holding national team training camps at the Karolyi ranch after Biles announced she didn't want to go back there, saying for the first time that she, too, had been abused by Larry Nassar.\n\nHer pointed criticism of federation CEO Kerry Perry\u2019s ineptitude, and interim leader Mary Bono\u2019s tone-deafness, hastened both of their departures.\n\nShe has continued to hold both USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee accountable for their failings.\n\nShe\u2019s also been honest about her emotions, the highs and the lows. She ran off the podium laughing and sticking out her tongue after a great uneven bars routine at the national championships in August, and did a mic drop after wrapping up her fifth world title on floor Thursday night.\n\nMORE:Simone Biles on where she keeps all those medals, her favorite athletes, her future\n\nMORE: Why Simone Biles has a 'love-hate' relationship with the balance beam\n\nShe talked of being so nervous she wanted to vomit before team finals, and made no secret of her displeasure with herself after falling the first time she tried her triple-twisting, double somersault pass on floor exercise in competition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned as I\u2019ve gotten older that it\u2019s OK to show real, raw emotion,\u201d Biles said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a robot all the time, and you don\u2019t always have to seem happy out there.\u201d\n\nAsked if she realizes the impact that can have, for youngsters in particular to see someone at the top of her game struggling with the same emotions they do, Biles said she does.\n\nThat\u2019s why she is willing to do it.\n\n\u201cIt also shows kids that it\u2019s OK, if you\u2019re enjoying the moment, to smile, to be happy. If you\u2019re not having a good time, it\u2019s OK, you don\u2019t have to hide that from people,\u201d she said. \u201cNot saying you should scream or punch things. You could probably do that behind the scenes. But if you\u2019re upset, you can show that you\u2019re upset.\u201d\n\nManaging her emotions is sure to take on greater importance in the month's leading up next year's Tokyo Olympics. Someone has to fill the void left by the retirements of Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt, and no athlete has more star power than Biles. Expect to see her everywhere in the lead-up to the Game, and hear about all the medals she will win.\n\n\u201cI try to stay focused on myself and the expectations I have for myself going in. But at times it\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d Biles said, pausing. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Somehow I just manage it.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the position Biles expected to be in when she came back after taking off the year after the Rio Olympics.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t imagine being able to top 2016, when she left the Games with five medals, four of them gold. She\u2019d won the world title the three years prior to that, the first woman to win three in a row. And she had a winning streak of three-plus years, an unheard of run of consistency and dominance in a sport often decided by tenths and hundredths of a point.\n\nYet she has not only topped what she did the last quadrennium, she\u2019s surpassed her former self.\n\nShe won her fifth world title by 2.1 points, her largest margin of victory yet at the world championships. Her 22 medals at worlds is only one less than the record by Belarus\u2019 Vitaly Scherbo, and she\u2019ll blow by that this weekend, having qualified for all four event finals.\n\nOh, she\u2019s also had three new skills named for her in the past year, one each on floor exercise, vault and balance beam.\n\n\u201cComing back, I was really nervous if I could top my 2016 performances,\u201d Biles said. \u201cOnce we started training and putting more skills in, and we competed for the first time, I was like 'Wow, I think I am better than 2016.\u2019 That\u2019s what blew my mind. Just looking at the differences in the videos.\n\n\u201cEven with my form,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit cleaner, too, on some of the things because we\u2019ve paid attention to detail there.\u201d\n\nLike Williams, like the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team, Biles is simply in a class by herself.\n\nShe was gifted with natural athletic ability, yes. But her technique is flawless, which allows her to do the skills that set her apart \u2013 far apart \u2013 from everyone else.\n\nHer triple-double in the team final was so huge, fans several rows up had to look up to watch it. That meant she was probably 9 feet in the air. Yet she stuck her landing, her feet not moving an inch.\n\nHer double-twisting, double somersault dismount on balance beam, considered by the International Gymnastics Federation to be so difficult that it watered down its value so other gymnasts wouldn\u2019t try it, is done with more ease than normal people would do a cartwheel.\n\nBiles appreciates the magnitude of what she\u2019s doing, because there are times she herself can\u2019t believe it, either.\n\n\u201cI wish I could have an out-of-body experience to witness it because sometimes I think I'm going crazy,\u201d she said Thursday night. \u201cI really don't know how I do it sometimes.\u201d\n\nBecause she\u2019s the best gymnast there is. And she\u2019s not afraid to own it.", "description": "Simone Biles may be better than ever with the Olympics coming next year, but she is concerned about more than her legacy in gymnastics.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published A.M.
