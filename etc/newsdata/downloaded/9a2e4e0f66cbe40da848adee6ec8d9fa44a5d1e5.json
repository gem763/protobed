I love my country and I won't allow her to receive any defamation or violation,' one person posted on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo.\n\n'Whoever buys their products is blind,' another post read.\n\nIt follows the Houston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, apologising on Monday for a swiftly deleted tweet over the weekend that included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.'\n\nHis support for the protests in the Chinese-ruled city angered Beijing, Chinese fans and the team's business partners in a key NBA market.\n\nThe Rockets are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Yao Ming in 2002, who became a star for Houston and helped build the NBA's following in China.\n\nFollowing the reaction from China, the NBA said in a statement it recognized Morey's views 'deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable'.\n\nHowever, the NBA's attempt to diffuse the situation resulted in fans, as well as Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, lashing out.\n\nThe U.S. lawmakers argued that the NBA's response was shameful and showed how China was using its economic power to censor speech by Americans in the United States.\n\nA protester covers an eye during a demonstration at Hong Kong International Airport in Hong Kong in solidarity with a protester being hit in the eye by a so-called beanbag round\n\nTiffany's CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said in August that continuous business disruptions in Hong Kong had impacted the company, estimating six full selling days were lost due to unplanned store closures during the second quarter of this year.\n\nBogliolo said the city was the brand's fourth-largest market by sales - after the US, Japan and mainland China.\n\nNew York-based Tiffany opened its largest-ever product exhibition in Shanghai in September, a move it hoped would attract young Chinese customers.\n\nThe company's sales grew more than 25 percent in mainland China between March and June - a stark contrast to a three-percent drop in the company's global turnover in the same period.\n\nTiffany has 35 shops in mainland China, and plans to open branches of its Blue Box Cafe in Hong Kong and Shanghai.", "description": "Angry Chinese buyers believed it was a deliberate echo of the pose adopted by Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators to denounce police violence in the semi-autonomous city.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19440136-0-image-a-48_1570533891819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
