Sometimes it\u2019s not.\n\n\n\nI laughed off this fan trying to kiss me at MNF, but I was PISSED! I\u2019m not the first broadcaster to experience this & I won\u2019t be the last, unfortunately.\n\n\n\nI truly love what I do, but this field can test you. pic.twitter.com/4kjTDqzd4G \u2014 Erin Kate Dolan (@erinkatedolan) October 23, 2019\n\nHuffPost reached out to Dolan, who did not immediately respond.\n\nShe is correct in that she\u2019s not the first TV reporter who was the subject of an attempted assault.\n\nLast month, Sara Rivest, a reporter for WAVE TV in Louisville, Kentucky, was doing a live segment outside a local music festival when a man planted an unwanted kiss on her cheek.\n\nShe ended up filing a police report and a suspect was arrested and charged with harassment with physical contact.\n\nIn 2003, ESPN reporter Suzy Kolber had to deal with an obviously drunk Joe Namath who kept saying he wanted to kiss her during a sideline interview at a Jets game. The experience led the former football star to quit drinking.", "description": "Erin Kate Dolan said she \"laughed off this fan\" trying to kiss her at Monday Night Football, but she \"was pissed!\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db0bd3f210000d428ad3b6f.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
