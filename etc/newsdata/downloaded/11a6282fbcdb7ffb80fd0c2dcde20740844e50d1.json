Combatants eschew boxing gloves for thin gauze wrapped around hardened knuckles and head-butting is permitted.\n\nLike many in Kayah state, the fighter\u2019s family are subsistence farmers. \u201cMy parents live hand-to-mouth. That helped drive me to success,\u201d said Bozhena.\n\nHer ambition to excel in MMA was also inspired by the increasingly high profile of Myanmar-born fighters.\n\nThe most well-known \u2014 and Bozhena\u2019s hero \u2014 is Aung La Nsang, an ethnic Kachin nicknamed the \u201cBurmese Python\u201d who holds both middleweight and light heavyweight world titles for One Championship.\n\nThe 34-year-old was even voted 2019 International Fighter of the Year at Las Vegas-based World MMA Awards.\n\nBozhena\u2019s career is still in its infancy, but she is already proving a formidable foe. In a knuckle-biting battle in July against Vietnamese-American fighter Bi Nguyen, the judges favoured her in a split decision.\n\nShe has gained fans across Myanmar, including within her once-disapproving community, she says with a smile. \u201cNow when I have a fight, my house is packed with people who come to watch,\u201d she said.\n\nSocial norms aside, Bozhena decries the lack of support for women wanting to get in the ring, saying men are more readily offered sponsorship deals and high-profile fights.\n\n\u201cThere should be no gender discrimination,\u201d she said, explaining that was the reason she left the lethwei arena for MMA.\n\nDespite the challenges the trailblazer vowed to fight on. \u201cI miss the days when I could be beautiful and feminine, but I prefer the path I have chosen.\u201d", "description": "Yangon (AFP) \u2013 Myanmar\u2019s Bozhena Antoniyar had to side-step conservative parents to take up bare-knuckle fighting, but her stealth paid off on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/10ead2_bare-knuckle-fighter-bozhena-antoniyar-exploded-on-mma-scene-record-24-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
