Since graduating, he co-founded the company SPIKE Technologies which aims to keep on redeveloping and designing batteries that will make electric vehicles even more viable.\n\nAnd while they've already started collaborating with a Kenyan company on another prototype for mass production, the long-distance electric bike might just become the next best way to see the country without killing the planet.\n\nREAD: #FutureProofAfrica: Putting humanity back into exponential technology\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
