I'm far too competitive, says Bond star\n\nBefore she sizzled as Miss Moneypenny in a slew of Bond films, Samantha Bond always dreamed of becoming a ballerina.\n\nBut despite being light on her feet, the 57-year-old tells me that she'd never compete on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing.\n\n'The problem is that I'd be hatefully competitive and I don't think that would actually work very well on the show.'\n\nCrumbs! They made Erin into a cake (with a biscuit bottom)\n\nVogue cover star Erin O'Connor turned heads when she walked on the catwalk wearing a pink and red tulle grown earlier this year.\n\nNow she reveals her Schiaparelli dress has been turned into an edible experience at The Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge.\n\n'I've been morphed into a delicious cake,' the 41-year-old mother-of-two tells me.\n\nVogue cover star Erin O'Connor turned heads when she walked on the catwalk wearing a pink and red tulle grown this year (left), which has been turned into an edible experience (right)\n\n'I've done some crazy, curious things during my career but this! It's an incredible honour.'\n\nThe red plum mousse, aka Erin's Schiaparelli cake, is set on sponge and topped with meringue.\n\nSpeaking at a party in Mayfair, she tells me: 'I've tried it and it was surprisingly light and very delicious and it had a biscuit at the bottom, which is always quite nice.'\n\nPhilip Glenister, star of new ITV series, Belgravia, Julian Fellowes's Downton Abbey follow-up set in 1840s high-society London, insists he is nothing like Hugh Bonneville, who plays the Earl of Grantham in the Edwardian costume drama.\n\n'I'm not playing a lord, I'm nouveau riche,' Glenister tells me. 'I don't play lords. I play the man that built Belgravia.\n\n'I'm not the Hugh Bonneville of Belgravia, he's much posher than me, he's from Sussex whereas I'm a North London lad.'\n\nFight!\n\nHow Lady Amelia stays streets ahead of rivals\n\nSOLO STAR: Lady Amelia Windsor stole the show at the Louis Vuitton Maison relaunch party in New Bond Street.\n\n'I don't have a specific style. If I like someone in the street's clothing, I always say, 'You look amazing.'\n\n'Always compliment someone if you can.'\n\nLady Amelia Windsor (left) stole the show at the Louis Vuitton Maison relaunch party in New Bond Street, while Kylie (right) dazzled at the after-party at Annabel's\n\nDOUBLE ACT: Yasmin Le Bon and daughter Amber. 'As I grow older I try to wear less safe clothes,'\n\nYasmin, 54, tells me. 'At my age the last thing I want to do is look safe.'\n\nPLOTTING? The Marquess of Cholmondeley's wife Rose Hanbury was avidly talking to LOVE magazine editor Katie Grand, who once convinced Liz Hurley to pose nude.\n\nSPOTLIGHT: Kylie Minogue dazzled at the after-party at Annabel's, singing Can't Get You Out Of My Head.\n\nSeven Worlds, One Planet Sir David Attenborough's new series, Seven Worlds, One Planet, will not receive the broadcasting legend's traditional prime-time slot after the BBC banished the show to 6.15pm on Sundays. An insider admits: 'The schedulers won't shift Antiques Roadshow.' With Netflix an attractive alternative outlet for Sir David, the BBC might be unwise to hide its most valuable asset.\n\nMany celebrities complain about the hardship of living in the public eye.\n\nBut not Poirot actor David Suchet.\n\nHe tells me: 'I'm extremely grateful for my career. Without fame and success, I would never have been able to do so many wonderful roles.'\n\nSpeaking at his photography exhibition, Behind The Lens, in aid of the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, the 73-year-old adds: 'At my age I'd be at home watching the telly.\n\n'I'm so, so lucky for the exposure I get and I'd never bite the hands that feed me.'", "description": "SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE: He has acknowledged that he and his older brother are 'on different paths' - and Prince Harry, I can disclose, is staying true to his word.", "authors": ["Sebastian Shakespeare For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20150764-0-image-a-41_1571947108233.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
