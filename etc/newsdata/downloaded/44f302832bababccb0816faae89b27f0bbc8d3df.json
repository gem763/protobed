There were no injuries.\n\nThe AAIB does not identify which company operated the flight during the accident on 6 February 2019.\n\nHowever, the Flight Safety Foundation independent non-profit organisation says it was a Condor Airlines flight. The plane was operated by Thomas Cook Airlines.\n\nWhat are the details of the cockpit accident?\n\nThe AAIB says the main pilot was monitoring the co-pilot over the Atlantic Ocean when coffee was served.\n\nThe drinks were given in cups without lids, which the AAIB says was normal for the company operating the flight.\n\nThe main pilot put the coffee on his tray table - but the cup was later knocked over.\n\nMost of the liquid fell onto the commander's lap and a small amount spilled on the main ACP1.\n\nThe ACP1 and later the co-pilot's ACP2 soon became hot enough to start melting one of its buttons.\n\nThis resulted in the control panels failing, and communication difficulties.\n\nThe decision was taken to divert to Shannon, and the plane landed safely.\n\nThe AAIB says that the operator has since changed their procedure to ensure that cup lids are provided for flights on all routes, and cabin crews are reminded of the requirements to use them.", "description": "The pilots' control panels started to melt and there was smoke during the accident in February.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17FF8/production/_108769289_coffee_spill_plane_split.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
