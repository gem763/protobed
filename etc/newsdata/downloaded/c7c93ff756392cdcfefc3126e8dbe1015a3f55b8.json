Though this European coffee maker is as easy to use as any other drip coffee maker you might buy off Amazon, unlike those $15 machines, the Moccamaster makes a basically perfect pot every single time, in six minutes or less. That\u2019s because the internal heating element is made of copper, so it quickly heats the water and keeps it at a steady brewing temperature, and that keeps your coffee from tasting burned or getting too hot to drink. And once your coffee is brewed, the heating element underneath the glass carafe keeps it at the ideal hot-yet-drinkable temperature without burning it. Plus, the Moccamaster made of stainless-steel, and it\u2019s based on a mid-century design, so it actually looks nice sitting out on your counter.\n\nToday only, this coffee maker is on sale for $247 at Amazon, 30 percent off the list price of $309. That\u2019s still admittedly a lot of money to spend on a coffee maker, but it\u2019s the easiest way to upgrade your at-home coffee routine without getting into pour-overs or homemade espresso. Plus, it\u2019s an actually good deal: The last time the Moccamaster was this cheap on Amazon was almost three years ago, in December 2016, and we\u2019re not sure the next time we\u2019ll see a deal this good on this fancy coffee maker again.\n\nTechnivorm Moccamaster KBG Coffee Brewer, 40 oz $320 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
