She had been an addict for more than 30 of her 47 years.\n\nContrary to the lyrics of her most famous song, her troubles never did melt like lemon drops.\n\nA few months before her death, she had headlined for five weeks at London's Talk Of The Town nightclub, a run that summed up the rollercoaster ride of her extraordinary career.\n\nRenee Zellweger stars as Judy Garland in the moving biopic that follows the star on her stint at The Talk Of The Town in London\n\nGarland could wow an audience with her stagecraft one night, and outrage it the next by showing up hopelessly drunk.\n\nShe got standing ovations at the Talk Of The Town, but also a barrage of bread rolls.\n\nThose concerts, intended to restore her financial security, are the focus of this compelling drama by Rupert Goold, a British director better known for his theatre work.\n\nIndeed, this film has its roots in a play, which is why it seems decidedly stagey at times.\n\nHappily, it also has Renee Zellweger, whose previous visits to Britain in the service of art were to play Bridget Jones and Beatrix Potter.\n\nCompleting an unlikely trio, her performance in the title role is truly spine-tingling.\n\nWe have lately become used \u2014 if you'll pardon the pun \u2014 to garlanded music biopics.\n\nThis year alone, Rami Malek bagged an Academy Award for his turn as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, while Taron Egerton received enthusiastic plaudits for his Elton John in Rocketman. 'I'm still standing,' he sang.\n\nZellweger leaves them both standing.\n\nSomewhere over the rainbow, maybe there's an Oscar waiting.\n\nThat would be true poetic irony, for Garland never got one.\n\nThe film starts as a young Judy is being auditioned for The Wizard Of Oz\n\nThe film starts years before the 1969 concerts, with the young Judy (Darci Shaw) being auditioned by MGM producer Louis B. Mayer for The Wizard Of Oz.\n\n'LB' at first seems avuncular, but flashbacks reveal him to be a monstrous bully, ordering that his teen star be fiercely chaperoned and given pills to take the edge off her appetite.\n\nThat's what started her on the yellow brick road to self-destruction.\n\nThree decades later, those destructive impulses have left her homeless, broke, dissolute.\n\nYet the film portrays her as more sinned against than sinning, and pretty much entitled to her abundant self-pity.\n\n'I want what everybody wants \u2014 I just have a harder time getting it,' she tells a British television interviewer.\n\nStill, she has at least clung on to a waspish wit and is a devoted if unreliable mother to younger children Lorna and Joey.\n\nAs for the most famous of her offspring, Liza Minnelli (Gemma-Leah Devereux), we meet her only briefly, at an LA party where Garland first encounters a charming young entrepreneur, Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock), who later visits her in England and, disastrously, becomes her fifth husband.\n\nThere is humour as well as sadness in all this.\n\nThe film has great fun with a pair of stage-door Johnnies, a gay couple who adore Garland and simply want her autograph, only for her to ask if they fancy joining her for dinner since she has nobody else for company.\n\nIt's a very funny scene, but also deeply poignant, and perhaps, in a wider sense, a timelessly eloquent comment on fame.\n\nReturn of the King \u2014 for one night only...\n\nElvis Unleashed (U)\n\nVerdict: A peek at peak Presley\n\nRating:\n\nElvis Presley's 1968 'Comeback Special' is one of the most celebrated televised concerts of all time \u2014 his first TV gig for seven years and an on-air reunion with guitarist Scotty Moore and drummer DJ Fontana.\n\nThe pair had played with him in the early years until they asked for more money and were promptly sacked by his autocratic manager, Colonel Tom Parker.\n\nElvis Unleashed, in cinemas for one night only next Monday, includes unseen footage from that NBC special.\n\nElvis Unleashed, in cinemas for one night only next Monday, includes unseen footage of the star\n\nIt's not quite on a par with the one-night-only Motown documentary shown this week.\n\nBut you don't need to be an Elvis fan to be dazzled by his extraordinary charisma and sexual magnetism, then arguably at their peak.\n\nNot to mention the music, which is fabulous. Incidentally, modern sensibilities should be checked in at the door.\n\n'Man, she's pretty,' murmurs Elvis, clocking a cute girl in the audience during Are You Lonesome Tonight? It's a fair bet he wasn't lonesome that night.\n\nA lodger who may not lodge in your mind\n\nGood Posture (15)\n\nVerdict: Worth slouching for\n\nRating:\n\nNovelists Zadie Smith and Martin Amis play themselves, with admirable plausibility, in this promising cinematic debut as a writer-director by British actress Dolly Wells, daughter of the late satirist John Wells.\n\nBut then she's hardly a newcomer, having written and starred in Doll & Em, an engaging TV comedy, which she created with close friend Emily Mortimer.\n\nMortimer stars in Good Posture as Julia Price, an acclaimed, reclusive British writer living in middle-class Brooklyn.\n\nBut the film's lead is Grace Van Patten, who sprang to notice last year in Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories.\n\nActually, this is a very Baumbach sort of story, but at times it gurns and strains to be kookily charming in a way that his pictures don't.\n\nNonetheless, Van Patten is excellent as Lilian, a spoiled young woman without much direction, who winds up lodging with Julia and her American musician husband.\n\nThe feckless Lilian and the uptight Julia are at loggerheads from the start, with the latter leaving catty messages in her lodger's journal.\n\nThe film chronicles their evolving relationship, as well as Lilian's relationships with the men in her life, including her self-centred father, shacked up with his French girlfriend in Paris.\n\nGood Posture is funny in parts and drags in others.\n\nDespite the title, it contains little to make you sit up straight. But it's worth seeing, and whether you do or not, look out for the beguiling Van Patten.\n\nIf not quite on the cusp of major stardom, she's right on the edge.", "description": "BRIAN VINER: Half a century ago, Judy Garland died in London from an accidental overdose of barbiturates.
