We want to continue to urge people with information to contact police on 0161 856 0394.\"\n\nThe Arndale shopping centre is open as usual today but there is an increased police presence around the city.\n\nA 40-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following the incident.\n\nForensic spent around five hours searching the house of the alleged attacker.\n\nNeighbours on Rochdale Road told the Manchester Evening News they immediately recognised the suspect when footage of his arrest by armed officers began circulating on social media.\n\nThis morning police confirmed a search had been carried out at an undisclosed location in Manchester where the suspected attacker had previously lived.\n\nHe's thought to have lived at the property for about 12 months.\n\nThe investigation is now being led by counter terrorism police.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nOfficers are trying to establish if the man had any political, religious or ideological motivation for the attack.\n\nThe man's mental health is also being closely considered as a factor in the attack.\n\nAfter being arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences he was detained under the Mental Health Act.\n\n(Image: MEN MEDIA)\n\nA woman in her 40s was not stabbed, but was assessed by paramedics, and another woman received a 'superficial knife injury' in the attack.\n\nThis morning Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said: \"The investigation will be continued by counter terrorism officers and an open mind is being kept in relation to any motive and of course the man is considered unfit to be kept in custody and has now been transferred to mental health detention.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told the Manchester Evening News he wished the victims a 'speedy recovery' and said he was prepared to authorise greater use of police stop and search powers in a bid to tackle knife crime.\n\nHe said: \"The investigation is ongoing but it appears to be an isolated incident.\n\n\"We are not unique. These things are happening around the world and we are living in more volatile time.\n\n\"Mental health is a growing concern not just for our society but everywhere.\n\n\"A lot of people come here for a lot of different reasons, it's a great city. Because of that, it brings extra pressure. It is very much business as usual today and great to see everyone returning.\n\n\"We are living in difficult times and it probably does mean we need to look out for each other and be extra vigilant, but for people coming to the city it's a case of recognising we are not immune to the times we are living in.\n\n\"This is a city that has a strong civic response and we will do everything to keep people safe here.\"", "description": "Three people were stabbed in the attack at Manchester's Arndale Shopping Centre on Friday", "authors": ["Damon Wilkinson", "Sophie Halle-Richards", "Image", "Copyright Cavendish Press", "Facebook", "Men Media", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560591.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchester.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
