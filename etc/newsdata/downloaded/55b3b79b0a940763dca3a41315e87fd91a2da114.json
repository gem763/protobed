Orders dipped 15 per cent from the same period last year. (The Logic, CNBC)\n\nTalking point: Grubhub\u2014now in third place in the U.S. with a 23 per cent market share\u2014is losing customers to Uber Eats and DoorDash, at 25 per cent and 35 per cent market share, respectively. Though it\u2019s the only major U.S. player currently turning a profit, it\u2019s become less profitable over the past two years thanks in part to a dramatic increase in spending on promotions. Unlike Uber and DoorDash, Grubhub features primarily small- and medium-sized independent restaurants in exclusive partnerships with the platform, but the firm said it will now branch out from that strategy to broaden its network and attract new diners. CEO Matt Maloney has described the food-on-demand industry as a \u201cweird bubble that is about to burst,\u201d adding that it\u2019s getting more difficult to raise funds as private investors become wary of high-profile startup failures like WeWork.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
