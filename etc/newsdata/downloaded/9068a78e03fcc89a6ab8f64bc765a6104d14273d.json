Ten of the videos found had more than a million views. Many were accompanied by adverts.\n\nThe unproven \"cures\" often involved consuming specific substances, such as turmeric or baking soda. Juice diets or extreme fasting were also common themes. Some YouTubers advocated drinking donkey's milk or boiling water. None of the so-called cures offered are clinically proven to treat cancer.\n\nAppearing before the fake cancer cure videos were adverts for well-known brands including Samsung, Heinz and Clinique.\n\nYouTube's advertising system means that both the Google-owned company and the video makers are making money from the misleading clips.\n\nImage copyright YouTube Image caption Khawla Aissane, speaking in Arabic on her YouTube channel, suggested donkey's milk could stop the activity of cancer cells\n\nShut down in English - but not other languages", "description": "", "authors": ["Flora Carmichael", "Juliana Gragnani", "Beyond Fake News", "Bbc Monitoring", "Chris Bell", "Ksenia Idrisova", "Karine Mirumyan", "Bbc News", "Bbc Trending", "In-Depth Reporting On Social Media"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
