Joe Biden has the second-highest odds at 18 percent.\n\n\u201cWall Street is not happy about Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Jim Awad, Clearstead senior managing director, told \u201cMaking Money with Charles Payne\u201d\n\nForbes Media Chairman Steve Forbes agreed.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren has to be taken seriously,\u201d he told \u201cCavuto Coast to Coast\u201d on FOX Business on Monday. \u201cWhen somebody like her, with her background, says she\u2019s a capitalist, you know that\u2019s the exact opposite of what she has in mind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarren, who incurred Wall Street's ire a decade ago by championing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced a proposal Monday for a 2 percent annual tax on wealth over $50 million and a 3 percent annual tax on wealth over $1 billion.\n\nThe proposal was the latest from the senator to draw the ire of Wall Street. Other such proposals include Medicare-for-all, which Warren has declined to say how she would pay for, leading to speculation she would raise taxes on the middle class too.\n\n\u201cShould she win the nomination, the equity market will start to price in the combination of a fiscal contraction under a Democratic government and less demand for equities from rich investors,\u201d Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, told FOX Business.\n\n\"Wealthy clients typically are willing to take more risk and look at long-term investing in a plethora of startups that end up in the Nasdaq and drive much of America's innovation,\" he said. \"The odds are that this one-two punch of a likely fiscal contraction and falling demand for riskier assets is unlikely to go down well.\"\n\nGaly says the stock market will fall 5 percent to 7 percent if Warren wins the Democratic nomination, with luxury names and pharmaceuticals likely seeing notable selling pressure.\n\nAwad agrees that markets would become more vulnerable if Warren wins the Democratic nomination.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cIf we get to September and she\u2019s the front-runner and builds momentum, it will be more pressure on the markets,\u201d he said.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren is shooting up the polls.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/370a17e3-1026ba66b1c74cf6a45d0324c2b939c8.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
