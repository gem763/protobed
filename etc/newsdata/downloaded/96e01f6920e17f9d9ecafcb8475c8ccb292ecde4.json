Wealthy investors are ditching bonds\n\nShort-term bonds have offered investors higher returns than their long-term counterparts since the yield curve inverted in August, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nBut an inverted bond yield curve isn't just an important indicator of a shrinking economy, according to Steven Kaye, a certified financial planner and the CEO of AEPG Wealth Strategies in Warren, New Jersey.\n\n\"Bonds offer little value currently, except for portfolio ballast,\" Kaye told Business Insider.\n\nReducing clients' exposure to bonds also reduces their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the overall market, Kaye said \u2014 two things that would be abundant in a recession.\n\nRead more: The yield curve is inverted. Here's what that means, and what the implications are for the economy.\n\n2. Instead, they're stockpiling cash to maintain their liquidity\n\nMoving one's fortune to cash is a popular way to ensure it outlasts a recession, according to Samuel Boyd, a certified financial planner and the senior vice president of Capital Asset Management in Washington, DC. \"The key to surviving, and thriving, in any recession is access to liquidity,\" Boyd said. \"As the old saying goes, 'cash is king,' and it can mitigate portfolio risk as well provide a fulcrum to capture opportunities when the world is on sale.\"\n\nThe billionaire hedge-fund manager Sam Zell of Equity Group Investments is also shifting the assets under his management into cash, he told CNBC earlier this month.\n\n\"We certainly never had a cash position like we have now,\" Zell said. \"I think we're very reticent about the opportunity. We think there's going to be some significant opportunities, but what we don't see is the urgency.\"\n\n3. The 1% are embracing ETFs to shield their wealth from unnecessary risk\n\nFor high-net-worth people, exchange-traded funds provide a lower-risk way to stay in the market amid increased volatility among equities.\n\n\"If you want to stay invested in equities until there is a stronger feel for a recession, then you could shift to index ETFs, to index low volatility ETFs,\" Folkes told Business Insider.\n\nFolkes also recommended that those looking to mitigate their risk invest in dividend-paying stocks with long histories.\n\n\"Shift more to high-quality dividend-paying companies that have shown historically they can handle prolonged periods of weakness in the market by having low debt and solid balance sheets,\" Folkes said.\n\n4. They are paying down any debts\n\nEven high-net-worth people who haven't reallocated their portfolios in anticipation of a market correction are looking to refinance and pay off their debts while interest rates remain relatively low, Jared Friedman, a certified financial planner with Redwood Planning in New Jersey, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Clients are asking about it and discussing it more but have not made any allocation changes at this time,\" Friedman said. \"We are trying to proactively pay down any extra debt and save more money.\"\n\n5. The best thing the ultra-wealthy can do is stop trying to game the market\n\nUltimately, though, the best thing nervous high-net-worth investors can do for their portfolios may be nothing at all, Smith told Business Insider.\n\n\"I have received a few questions from these clients about their current allocation and how different market scenarios will impact potential returns,\" Smith said. \"I reiterate that their risk tolerance, asset allocation, and ultimately their portfolio mix reflects a potential recession in the markets, and the most important thing they can do in order to maximize the probability of reaching long-term goals is to stick with their plan and don't give in to emotions.\"", "description": "Though many financial planners advise not altering your portfolio in reaction to the market, some high-net-worth people are shifting their fortunes from bonds and toward cash to reduce their risk.", "authors": ["Taylor Nicole Rogers"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d39c9018813a25b3b3fc1bc-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
