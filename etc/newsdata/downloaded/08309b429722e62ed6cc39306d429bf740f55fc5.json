Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally who has blasted the president's decision to remove troops and effectively allow a withering Turkish assault across the border into Syria, is among those working on the Senate legislation.\n\nHe and Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen are working on a resolution that would limit the ability of top Turkish officials, including President Recep Erdo\u011fan, to travel to the U.S. It also would hit the military and energy sector of the NATO ally, the Hill reported.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other top officials would have their ability to visit the U.S. limited under a bipartisan Senate resolution to protest Turkey's attack on Kurdish forces in Syria\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the proposed resolution might affect what Erdogan has said is a planned trip to Washington in the first part of November to meet with Trump. He told reporters about the trip in Ankara last week, Reuters reported.\n\nPelosi spoke with Graham Monday, as she prepares to have the House move rapidly with its own legislation, amid bipartisan condemnation of President Trump's decision to acknowledge Turkey's planned invasion in advance and remove U.S. troops. Turkey followed with an immediate invasion, while U.S. Kurdish allies responded by making a deal with Russia-backed Syria.\n\nPelosi tweeted Monday: 'Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President\u2019s dangerous decision in Syria immediately,' she wrote.\n\nShe backed off the language of moving to 'overturn' the policy, and wrote that the resolution coming to the floor would 'oppose' the policy.\n\n'Next, we must put together the strongest bipartisan, bicameral sanctions package similar to the bipartisan bill the House is advancing,' she wrote in another tweet.\n\n'As we find ourselves in a situation where the President gave a green light to the Turks to bomb and effectively unleashed ISIS, we must have a stronger sanctions package than what the White House is suggesting,' Pelosi wrote.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will take action this week on its own resolution dealing with Turkey\n\nA House resolution opposes President Trump's latest policy moves in Turkey and Syria\n\nTrump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham is working on the resolution\n\nSenator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) has teamed with Graham on the effort\n\nThis picture taken on October 15, 2019 shows smoke rising from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, from the Turkish side of the border at Ceylanpinar district in Sanliurfa, on the first week of Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces\n\nPelosi spoke with Graham about a bipartisan, bicameral resolution\n\nPelosi wants stronger sanctions than those in an executive order signed by Trump\n\nGraham has called the new Syria policy a 'disaster in the making.'\n\nIn a statement Pelosi said Trump 'has unleashed an escalation of chaos and insecurity in Syria. His announcement of a package of sanctions against Turkey falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster.'\n\n'This week we will proceed with bipartisan, bicameral action to oppose this irresponsible decision,' she added.\n\nThe House resolution coming to the floor is titled: 'Opposing the decision to end certain United States efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against Syrian Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria.' It references a sudden White House announcement state said: 'Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria' and that 'United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces \u2026 will no longer be in the immediate area.'\n\nThe White House announced its own sanctions on Monday, while also halting talks on a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey. An executive order by President Trump declares Turkey's cross-border invasion 'undermines the campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, endangers civilians, and further threatens to undermine the peace, security, and stability in the region.'\n\nAfter giving what Turkey took as a green light to invade, Trump said he is prepared to 'destroy Turkey's economy' to halt the military offensive.", "description": "Bipartisan Senate legislation would limit travel by top Turkish officials including President Erdogan and hit military and energy sectors, while House legislation is advancing.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/20/19755044-0-image-a-2_1571169213315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
