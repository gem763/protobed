The comedian asked her, \u201cHow many times when you were secretary of state did you have to say to Obama, \u2018You can\u2019t extort foreign countries to get dirt on your political enemies?\u2019 \u201c\n\nMrs. Clinton laughed and said, \u201cYeah, that never happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if the secretary of state was on the call, as it is now being reported, he should have been one of the very first people to, you know, just say, \u2018Wait a minute, we have got to clean this up, you can\u2019t let that stand,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know what he did.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Mr. Pompeo listened in on the Trump-Ukraine call that has led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nMrs. Clinton said she supported Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s decision and said Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior falls into the definition of impeachable offenses.\n\nMr. Colbert also got a laugh from Mrs. Clinton when he asked whether it was time to \u201cLock him up?\u201d \u2014 alluding to the \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants that became a hallmark of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign rallies.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
