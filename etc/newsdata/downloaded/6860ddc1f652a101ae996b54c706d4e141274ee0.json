REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nIn a statement announcing its decision to keep policy steady on Thursday, the BOJ prompted some head scratching by saying it would \u201cre-examine\u201d economic developments at next month\u2019s rate review.\n\nIn particular, it said \u201ccloser attention\u201d was needed to the possibility that the economy could lose momentum to hit its 2% inflation target.\n\nSome market watchers thought it could be a pre-commitment to ramp up stimulus at the BOJ\u2019s rate meeting on Oct. 30-31, but officials familiar with the central bank\u2019s thinking say it may be more a case of a central bank with limited options trying to buy time.\n\nThe wording of the phrase is vague enough to allow the BOJ to hold off on easing next month, if markets remain stable and global risks do not dampen still-resilient Japanese domestic demand, they say.\n\n\u201cThe BOJ signalled that risks are rising and that it\u2019s ready to act if needed. But it doesn\u2019t have any pre-set idea on when to ease,\u201d one of the officials said on condition of anonymity.\n\nBOJ policymakers instead had their eyes set on the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which both topped up monetary support this month, the officials said.\n\nFailure to act when other central banks were easing risks triggering significant yen rises, putting further pressure on exports and cooling business sentiment.\n\nYen moves have always been key drivers of action for the BOJ. A former top currency diplomat, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is skilful at jawboning markets and discouraging excessive bets on yen appreciation, people who know him say.\n\n\u201cThe primary objective of the new phrase was to keep yen gains in check,\u201d said former BOJ board member Takahide Kiuchi, who is now an economist at Nomura Research Institute. \u201cBOJ officials are probably relieved the yen didn\u2019t rise too much.\u201d\n\nThe yen rallied on Thursday after the BOJ\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold but hovered around 108 to the dollar, well below the 100 level seen by markets as the bank\u2019s line-in-the-sand.\n\nBut while the BOJ may have succeeded in keeping yen bulls at bay for now, it also has to prevent markets from pricing in an October easing too heavily and cornering it into action.\n\nThe BOJ wants to use its remaining ammunition wisely as years of heavy money printing has left it with few tools to fight the next recession. Many BOJ officials are also wary of the rising cost of prolonged easing, such as the strain ultra-low rates is inflicting on financial institutions\u2019 profits.\n\nPushing short-term rates deeper into negative territory, which is a key option if the BOJ were to ease, remains unpopular particularly among Japan\u2019s banking industry.\n\n\u201cThe BOJ doesn\u2019t want markets to interpret the new phrase as signalling an October easing is a done deal,\u201d said Kazuo Momma, a former BOJ official who is now an economist at Mizuho Research Institute.\n\n\u201cIt will try to manage market expectations via speeches and other means of communication leading up to the October meeting.\u201d\n\nKuroda will speak to business leaders in Osaka, western Japan, on Tuesday. Board members Takako Masai and Yukitoshi Funo will also speak on Sept. 25 and Oct. 3, respectively.", "description": "By adding vague new language to its latest policy statement, the Bank of Japan is hoping to keep unwanted sharp gains in the yen in check, without having to tap its depleted policy tool-kit or tying its hands on future monetary action.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431933119&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0OB", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
