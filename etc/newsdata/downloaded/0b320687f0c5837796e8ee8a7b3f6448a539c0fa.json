Cox says she advises people who want to succeed to stay engaged in their chosen career and try to learn every aspect of it, because once that door \"does open, you need to be prepared to walk through it.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of hard work and perseverance around putting yourself in the right place and [also] a little bit of luck,\" Cox says.\n\nCox, who grew up in Mobile, Alabama, says she gets her drive from her single mother, Gloria Cox, who worked two or three jobs to support her and her twin brother growing up. Cox says her mother taught her to \"work really, really hard\" for what she wanted in life, even through the hardships.\n\nAt the age of 11, Cox says, she attempted suicide after developing feelings for her male classmates and was repeatedly bullied for not acting like the other young boys in her grade. Later, during her college years, Cox decided to begin to medically transition to female and continue her path to become an actress.\n\nShe says after she landed a successful platform as an actress, she decided to use it to help others.\n\n\"I still don't know how long I'll have this platform, so I wanted to try to make a difference while I have it,\" Cox says. \"I'm passionate about humanizing trans people in the LGBTQ community. But then I'm also a person of color, and so I approach the world that way as well, and I'm a woman, so I just allow myself to exist in the intersection of all those places unapologetically and always proceeding with love.\"\n\nLike this story?
