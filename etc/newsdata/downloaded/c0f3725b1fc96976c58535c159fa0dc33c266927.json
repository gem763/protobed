As soon as we got the first one, I knew it was game on and thankfully we ended up at the end nicking a point.\n\n\u201cI have been there myself in moments when things have not been going great. Big clubs\u2019 fans expect result after result and for us to come here, they started well and it settled the crowd down but then it was for us to react, turnaround and not accept that we are going to roll over.\n\n\u201cWe hit them on the break a few times and in the end we took a point which, given the tough run of games we\u2019ve got, is a very good point.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Gary Cahill believes Crystal Palace\u00a0could have left Arsenal\u00a0with a sensational three points were it not for a \u201crugby tackle\u201d on Wilfried Zaha.
