House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated public sentiment was a big part of the reason she launched an impeachment inquiry into the president in the first place, and if it continues to shift against Trump that bolsters her case and the potential for a vote on impeachment.\n\nFrom September 25 to 26 and then again from October 4 to 5, Insider asked: \"How familiar would you say you are with the situation stemming from President Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky related to Democratic candidate Joe Biden?\"\n\nSimultaneously, across the same set of dates, Insider asked, \"Impeachment is the first step in the process of removing a president from office. Do you think the House of Representatives should impeach President Trump?\"\n\nThe poll's key findings over this time period:\n\nThe number of respondents who said they're \"very\" or \"extremely\" familiar with the Ukraine situation increased by 7.7 percentage points, from 33.3% to 41%.\n\nAmong those who said they were \"extremely familiar\" with the Ukraine situation, \"strong\" support for impeachment increased by 3.3 percentage points \u2014 up to roughly 46% percent \u2014 and \"strong\" opposition to impeachment decreased by 5.9 percentage points \u2014 down to approximately 32%.\n\nThe poll's findings suggest that in the course of just two weeks knowledge of the Ukraine scandal has increased significantly, and that has gradually translated into higher support for impeachment.\n\nRead more: These are the key players you need to know to make sense of the Trump impeachment inquiry\n\nThe Ukraine controversy spiraled out of a whistleblower complaint linked to a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call, Trump urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a top political rival of the president's and a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint accuses Trump of using the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election. The White House has also released a memo on the call that corroborates details in the complaint. As the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire recently put it, the complaint is \"in alignment\" with the White House memo.\n\nRead more: Trump is dragging down Biden with him as the Ukraine scandal threatens to upend his presidency\n\nTrump has sought to spin the story into a tale of corruption on the part of Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company with a dubious owner. There's no evidence of wrongdoing or illegal activity on the part of either Biden.\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender.
