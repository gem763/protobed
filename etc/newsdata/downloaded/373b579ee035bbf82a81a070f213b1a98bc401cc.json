In his spare time, the young man works out and moves around his room as if avoiding enemy fire. He\u2019s still boyish in these moments \u2014 hitting his head on a toy basketball hoop in his room and using his skateboard as a stand-in rifle. He thinks he\u2019s ready for war and to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps into service. However, Dan Krauss\u2019 sobering drama \u201cThe Kill Team\u201d shows that there\u2019s nothing to prepare a young soldier for when your commander leads you and your brothers-in-arms astray.\n\nThat sense of Andrew\u2019s promising energy fades quickly once the story shifts to Afghanistan in 2009. The cinematography (by St\u00e9phane Fontaine, \u201cJackie\u201d) imagines a color-drained horizon, a place where everything is dusty and the brightest pop of color is the overhanging pale sky. The War on Terror is still claiming lives on both sides, and the movie quickly establishes how bleak and sketchy the frontlines remain when Andrew\u2019s squad loses their leader on the way to give local children candy.\n\nLike other recent war movies, there\u2019s an uneasy tension throughout the film, as it\u2019s almost impossible for the soldiers to tell the difference between enemy and civilians. One man who\u2019s not going to play by the standard rules of combat is Sergeant Deeks (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd), the new leader assigned to Andrew\u2019s platoon. He\u2019s a shoot-first-ask-later type. He\u2019s also a terrifyingly calculating boss pitting his soldiers against one another to assert their leadership potential, and he soon leads the men to kill more locals and plant fake evidence to hide their crimes.\n\nAlso Read: 'The Kill Team': Alexander Skarsgard Tests Moral Limits in Trailer for Afghanistan War Story (Video)\n\nAs Deeks spreads the same bloodthirsty mentality to his men, Andrew questions his squad leader\u2019s actions and shares his concerns with his military dad. He must then decide whether to risk whistleblowing, which would put him in his squad\u2019s line of fire, or to keep a low profile to survive the war and his fellow soldiers.\n\nBased on the true story of Adam Winfield, \u201cThe Kill Team\u201d is both a tense moral thriller and a disheartening account of our country\u2019s actions abroad. Many of the details of the group\u2019s experiences come from Krauss\u2019 documentary of the same name. In the 2013 film, Winfield, a few of his fellow squad members, and his parents retrace the events of these unlawful kills led by Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs while facing the consequences of those attacks.\n\nAlso Read: 'Sweetheart' Film Review: Kiersey Clemons Plays a Desert-Island Survivor, Who's Always Been a Survivor\n\nIn both versions, the squad leader is a domineering presence, towering over the men who sought his approval. As envisioned by Skarsg\u00e5rd, Deeks is the type of leader to speak so softly that you have to lean in to hear him, to shower praise and attention on his chosen favorites, and to ink skull tattoos on his shins to show off the number of kills he\u2019s acquired while on multiple tours. While he\u2019s a more of a mystery in the documentary, Skarsg\u00e5rd gives him a different kind of ominous edge \u2014 a quiet demeanor and a scowling poker face that makes it almost impossible to figure out what he\u2019s thinking.\n\nLike the documentary, the narrative movie doesn\u2019t absolve Andrew/Adam from his own mistake; instead, it explores war\u2019s complicated morality through his experience. On the third attack by the self-christened \u201ckill team,\u201d Andrew is part of the firing squad that kills a man. The story is no longer a simple morality play of good and evil, but one that shows how hard it can be to do good when a system is set up to reward the evil. Other horrific behaviors described in the documentary are lightly recreated in the film but not to its full graphic extent, potentially as a mercy to the audience or to avoid sensationalizing the tragic deaths of three unarmed Afghani citizens, the youngest of which was a 15-year-old boy.\n\nAlso Read: 'The Current War: Director's Cut' Film Review: Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Shannon Liven Up a Dull History Lesson\n\nThe documentary serves as a more of a holistic view of this sad chapter in American history, compiling various testimonies and featuring Winfield\u2019s parents and fellow platoon members much more prominently. The narrative film enhances Andrew\u2019s feeling of isolation in his unenviable position, the paranoia that crept into every part of his life and the unending guilt of not figuring a way to stop the killings sooner. Overall, this latest version is still relatively straightforward, with somber music cues and enough artistic license to separate it from the archival footage in the documentary.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Andrew Briggman (Nat Wolff) is ready to go into the army.
