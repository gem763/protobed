[Photo provided to China Daily]\n\nToday is the 35th Chinese Teachers' Day \u2013 a festival celebrating the 2,300-year tradition of respecting teachers and education in China. It's similar to the birthday of Confucius or the birthday of private school tutor in ancient China.\n\nThe history of Teacher's Day traces back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220). According to record, during the Han (202 BC\u2013AD 220) and Jin (1115-1234) dynasties, on August 27 each year, the birthday of Confucius, the emperor would go to Confucius' temple and pay tribute to the ancient philosopher followed by court officials, and would also invite royal teachers to the imperial court for a banquet.\n\nLocal officials followed the court, and on this day, teachers around the nation enjoyed a day's vacation and were given dried meat as gifts.\n\nThe capital, all states and counties would also stage sacrificial ceremonies to worship Confucius, with local chiefs or the emperor leading rituals. Excellent-performed teachers would be chosen from academies and learning institutions nationwide, reporting to the royal court and given 500 liang (\u4e24) silver coins as awards.\n\nUntil the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the sacrificial ceremony, on August 27, was of a larger scale. The teachers' salaries in schools and academies around the nation were raised, and well-performing teachers would be conferred official titles or promoted to higher positions.", "description": "Today is the 35th Chinese Teachers' Day \u2013 a festival celebrating the 2,300-year tradition of respecting teachers and education in China.
