Well, here's your answer...\n\nSex image from Shutterstock\n\nI know there\u2019s a lot more to sex than putting the penis into the vagina and ejaculating, but the rest is not always easy to define (kissing? Rubbing? Grinding?). To keep things simple and specific, we\u2019ll just focus on the time to ejaculation.\n\nMeasuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter. What about just asking people how long they take, you say? Well, there are two main problems with this. One is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it\u2019s socially desirable to say you go long into the night.\n\nThe other problem is that people don\u2019t necessarily know how long they go for. Sex isn\u2019t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making.\n\nWhat does the research say?\n\nThe best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period \u2013 using a stopwatch.\n\nThat is as practically awkward as it sounds: participants pressed \u201cstart\u201d at penile penetration and \u201cstop\u201d at ejaculation. You may note this could affect the mood somewhat, and might perhaps not exactly reflect the natural flow of things. But \u2013 science is rarely perfect, and this is the best we\u2019ve got.\n\nSo what did the researchers find? The most striking result is that there was a huge amount of variation. The average time for each couple (that is, averaged across all the times they had sex) ranged from 33 seconds to 44 minutes. That\u2019s an 80-fold difference.\n\nSo it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no one \u201cnormal\u201d amount of time to have sex. The average (median, technically) across all couples, though, was 5.4 minutes. This means that if you line up the 500 couples from shortest sex to longest sex, the middle couple goes for an average of 5.4 minutes each time they do it.\n\nThere were some interesting secondary results, too. For example, condom use didn\u2019t seem to affect the time, and neither did men\u2019s being circumcised or not, which challenges some conventional wisdom regarding penile sensitivity and its relationship to staying power in the sack.\n\nIt didn\u2019t much matter which country the couples came from either \u2013 unless they came from Turkey, in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter (3.7 minutes) than couples from other countries (Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Another surprising finding was that the older the couple, the shorter the sex, contrary to the prevailing wisdom (probably peddled by older men).\n\nWhy do we have sex for so long?\n\nAs an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: Why does it last any time at all? All sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. Why all the thrusting and bumping? Instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day?\n\nBefore you say, Because it\u2019s fun to go in and out!, remember evolution doesn\u2019t care about fun per se \u2013 it generally only \u201cdesigns\u201d things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations. For example, even though we like eating food, we don\u2019t chew each mouthful of it for five minutes just to make the enjoyment last longer. That would be inefficient, and so we\u2019ve evolved to find it gross.\n\nWhy we last so long is a pretty complicated question with no clear answer, but a clue may be in the way the penis is shaped. In 2003, researchers showed \u2013 using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) \u2013 that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina.\n\nWhat this suggests is that men\u2019s repeated thrusting might function to displace other men\u2019s semen before ejaculating, ensuring their own swimmers have a better chance of reaching the egg first. Incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well.\n\nSo what to do with this information? My advice would be to try not to think about it during the throes of passion.\n\nBrendan Zietsch, Research Fellow, The University of Queensland\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.", "description": "If you\u2019re a non-scientist, you might have once asked yourself, propped against the bedhead after disappointingly quick intercourse, how long does sex \u201cnormally\u201d last?
