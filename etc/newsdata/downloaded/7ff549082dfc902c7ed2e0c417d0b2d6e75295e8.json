That\u2019s the snob in me talking.\u201d\n\nInstant coffee, often relegated to brownie recipes and steak rubs, is making a comeback and even winning grudging approval from connoisseurs. A handful of startups including Waka, Sudden Coffee and Swift Cup Coffee have improved the taste and are attracting a new generation of convenience seekers who are too young to associate the product with the stuff their grandparents drank. They don\u2019t mind paying up either: A Sudden four-pack sold at the Chicago-based coffee chain Intelligentsia goes for $13, or about $3.25 a serving.\n\nInstant remains a niche product, with just 6% of Americans drinking it, according to the National Coffee Association. But U.S. retail sales of the category rose in the year ended in June\u2014the first gain following at least three years of declines, according to Nielsen data. Rising sales and instant\u2019s popularity among 18- to 39-year-olds have prompted industry stalwarts Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc. to re-evaluate the category.\n\n\u201cInstant is super convenient and portable,\u201d says Jim Watson, a beverage analyst at Rabobank. \u201cYou can throw a couple in your bag and travel everywhere. Instant has always been weighed down by being seen as a really low-end product. These specialty guys are making instant coffee cool again.\u201d\n\nDeveloped by Nestle SA last century, instant coffee was made by spraying brewed liquid into hot air and drying it into powder or granules. Nestle, Folgers and Maxwell House quickly became the go-to brands for middle class people around the world. A Folgers television commercial from that era featured a husband complaining about his wife\u2019s coffee. \u201cHoney, your coffee is undrinkable,\u201d he says. Later, she serves him a cup of Folgers, and marital harmony is restored. \u201cInstant Folgers,\u201d an announcer says. \u201cTastes good as fresh-perked.\u201d\n\nFor those who had tried the real thing, instant coffee lacked the body and flavor of a quality cup of Joe. No matter, Americans were hooked on convenience. Making instant involved nothing more than spooning crystals into a mug and adding boiling water\u2014then maybe whitening the concoction with a powdered creamer.\n\nEverything changed when Starbucks created the cafe culture in the 1990s and popularized Arabica beans\u2014the premium variety. A snob ethos took hold, and consumers thought nothing of paying $3 or more for a cup of coffee. In 1998, Keurig K-Cups\u2014or single-use pods\u2014entered the mix. It wasn\u2019t quite instant, but provided a popular way for time-pressed people to brew fast.\n\nInstant was re-imagined 10 years ago, when Starbucks introduced Via Ready Brew packets in an effort to sell more coffee in grocery stores. Via was made with 100% Arabica beans, cost less than $1 per cup and appealed to people on the go. Sales have been steady but have never really taken off, says John A. Quelch, dean of the Miami Business School at the University of Miami, who has done Starbucks case studies. \u201cThey didn\u2019t put a tremendous amount of marketing muscle behind it,\u201d he says.\n\nWith K-Cup growth slowing and Starbucks not pushing Via hard, a host of small players have emerged, employing new methods they say produce better-tasting instant. They typically freeze-dry Arabica beans and sell their wares online or in specialty coffee shops.\n\nSudden was co-founded by a Finnish barista named Kalle Freese, who pioneered a technique in San Francisco that involves lowering the temperature of brewed coffee to -20 degrees Fahrenheit then heating it slightly to let the water vaporize. The traditional heating method can taste \u201cwoody and burnt,\u201d says Sudden Chief Executive Officer Josh Zloof. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason from a science perspective why instant coffee has to taste bad.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Benji Walklet recently reviewed the instant java sold by\u00a0Los Angeles startup Waka Coffee.\u00a0Walklet, who runs the Coffee Concierge blog,\u00a0liked it but got a second opinion from a trusted critic\u2014his wife, who has been known to compare coffee she doesn\u2019t like to gasoline.\u00a0\u201cIt passed my wife", "authors": ["Leslie Patton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YUAhW07Ocx5qXgWbwG2O8g--~B/aD03OTY7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/9804ab2222d4d2faceb25d2301ae482f", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
