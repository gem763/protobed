REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nAfter LSE rebuffed its offer, HKEX is appealing directly to LSE shareholders and has until Oct. 9 to decide whether to go hostile.\n\nHKEX has said that the LSE must ditch its bid for Refinitiv for its offer to go ahead. Thomson Reuters, a professional information company that is the parent of Reuters News, holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv.\n\nBut Schwimmer said that buying Refinitiv bolsters the LSE\u2019s position in a growing data market and broadens assets traded to include foreign exchange and fixed income.\n\n\u201cThe Refinitiv transaction does that, and does it very well,\u201d Schwimmer said.\n\nHKEX Chief Executive Charles Li said the timing for its bid for the LSE was not good, but it was a case of \u201cnow \u201cor never\u201d as the London bourse offered an opportunity for HKEX to become a more global company.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to think big, when the world is polarising to the east and west, it is time to become global,\u201d Li told the Sibos conference.\n\n\u201cTogether we can unlock the last frontier.\u201d\n\nSeveral \u201cbig bang\u201d exchange mergers have failed in recent years, opposed by politicians and regulators.\n\nLi said that although HKEX\u2019s bid for the LSE is \u201cdisruptive and unusual\u201d, it would bring the huge Chinese market and the West together.\n\nUnlike previous big merger attempts, the deal is not about cost savings, Li said.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nLi and Schwimmer offered contrasting views on trends in China\u2019s capital market.\n\nSchwimmer said Shanghai would become China\u2019s top financial centre in the longer term, and the trend of the market opening up would \u201cslowly but surely\u201d continue.\n\nThe LSE has just launched a type of cross listing connection with Shanghai in June but only one Chinese company has so far made use of it.\n\nLi, however, said China would only relax capital controls in the long term.\n\n\u201cCapital controls will continue to be with us for our generation,\u201d Li said.\n\nHKEX\u2019s bid for the LSE has raised concerns that China would have undue influence over the London bourse given that some HKEX board members are appointed by the Hong Kong government.\n\nLi said if the LSE deal is allowed to go ahead, the current governance structure for HKEX may no longer be appropriate.\n\n\u201cWe are completely open to having a discussion on governance,\u201d Li said.", "description": "Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing (HKEX) said it was \"thinking big\" in its $39 billion London Stock Exchange bid as LSE CEO David Schwimmer said he was sticking with his $27 billion purchase of data and analytics company Refinitiv.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433318860&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0ZE", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
