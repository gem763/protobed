REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nThe Lloyds Bank Business Barometer slid to 1% from 13% in July, its lowest level since December 2011, when Britain was struggling to recover from the global financial crisis.\n\nSeparately, a survey of consumer confidence from market research company GfK was its joint weakest since mid-2013, driven lower by deepening pessimism about the economy.\n\nThe signs of a wilting economy - similar to elsewhere in Europe - raise the stakes for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nIf his gambit of suspending parliament to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 fails, he may have to fight a national election while the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy falls deeper into malaise.\n\n\u201c(The surveys) do seem to indicate that the rebound in the third quarter that many of us anticipated on the back of a weak second quarter might be somewhat muted,\u201d Peter Dixon said.\n\nBritain\u2019s economy shrank in the second quarter, a hangover from the stockpiling boom in advance of the original March Brexit deadline. Another contraction in the current quarter would officially herald a recession.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly weakish environment, what with global problems and of course our own domestic issues to worry about,\u201d Dixon added.\n\nBusiness confidence declined in every region of the United Kingdom, Lloyds said, although the fall was steepest in the manufacturing-heavy East Midlands region of England.\n\nBritish manufacturers, who account for about 10% of the economy, are facing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit which is likely to hurt their supply chains, plus a slowdown in the global economy.\n\nCONSUMER CONSTERNATION\n\nSeparate data added to signs the housing market, which slowed sharply after the 2016 Brexit vote, is stabilising.\n\nBritish banks approved the greatest number of mortgages in two years during July, the Bank of England said, while mortgage lender Nationwide reported house prices increased at the fastest annual pace in three months.\n\nAt -14, the GfK survey was the weakest since January, before which it had been lower only in mid-2013. All the survey\u2019s components, including the outlook for personal finances and the economy, declined in August.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People walk through the financial district of Canary Wharf, London, Britain 28 September 2017.
