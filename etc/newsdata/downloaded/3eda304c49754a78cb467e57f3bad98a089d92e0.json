The space agency's 10-year plan involves billions of dollars and spans millions of miles. And much like the universe, it's only expanding.\n\nOn Monday, NASA administrators announced a new plan to launch a telescope into Earth's orbit that will hunt for deadly asteroids.\n\nIn June, the agency introduced a mission that aims to fly a nuclear-powered helicopter over the surface of Titan, an icy moon of Saturn's, to scan for alien life. NASA wants to look for life in the ocean below the icy surface of Jupiter's moon Europa, too.\n\nThese plans follow an announcement NASA last year that described plans to send astronauts back to the moon and eventually build a base there, with a subsequent Mars-bound mission in the years after that.\n\nOther future missions will try to photograph our entire cosmic history and map the dark matter and dark energy that govern our universe.\n\nHere are some of NASA's biggest and most ambitious plans for the coming decade.", "description": "NASA intends to return to the moon, continue on to Mars, and look for life near Saturn and Jupiter within 10 years.
