That's happened a lot and it's still happening,\" Ballet Philippines President Kathleen Liechtenstein tells AFP.\n\nPrincipal dancer Denise Parungao, who started out as an $40-a month-apprentice at the troupe, says she relied on family to help pay her rent and understands why others left.\n\n\"It's really hard because the salary before was really low and most of the dancers are not well off,\" the 25-year-old explains.\n\n- 'Filipinas have more heart' -\n\nPart of the success of Ballet Philippines has been the determination of its performers.\n\nIn 2014, a fierce typhoon knocked out power and floods left the orchestra stranded miles from the venue, but with two hours before the show started -- the organisation decided to carry on so as not to disappoint audiences who had travelled for the show.\n\n\"The lights came back on as the people started to fill the Cultural Center of the Philippines lobby. It was a harrowing experience,\" recalls Liechtenstein, who says they had to use recorded music in place of live musicians.\n\n\"The dancing was exquisitely unforgettable,\" she says, adding that the audience agreed -- giving a roading standing ovation.\n\nUnlike in Russia and the West, there is no national programme for spotting dancing talent in the Philippines and few get an early start -- those that succeed must battle to make their mark\n\nThe same grit is evident down even when it comes to the use of dancing shoes.\n\nIn big name companies a performer might go through four pairs of ballet slippers in the course of a single performance.\n\n\"In Ballet Philippines, a dancer wears (a pair) for a whole month. They put glue, they varnish, do everything just to make them last,\" Parungao says.\n\nShe buys an extra five pairs a year out of her own pocket to make sure her footwear does not disintegrate during a live performance.\n\n\"Filipinas really have more heart in doing this... we give our whole selves to it,\" Parungao adds.\n\nUnlike in Russia and the West, there is no national programme for spotting dancing talent in the Philippines and few get an early start -- those that succeed must battle to make their mark.\n\n- 'Love to entertain' -\n\nCarlo Pacis, a former senior soloist at the Hong Kong Ballet who briefly returned to Manila to choreograph \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for Ballet Philippines, believes its dancers' strengths are not just physical.\n\n\"We do not only dance: we embody the roles that we are tasked to portray. We love to act, we love to entertain,\" he says.\n\nBallet Philippines declined to give its annual funding, but sources in the arts world said its four to six productions per year cost at least $100,000 each.\n\nThough it has always had free use of the national cultural centre's facilities, the company only gets about $40,000 a year in government backing.\n\nFor the rest it must rely on seat sales and sponsorships, as well as donations: The board of directors, a who's who of the country's wealthiest families, collectively put up 30 percent of the company's annual budget.\n\nPart of the success of Ballet Philippines has been the determination of its performers\n\nFounded in 1969 by pioneering Filipina contemporary dancer and choreographer Alice Reyes with help from Imelda Marcos -- whose husband Ferdinand ruled the country as a dictator until his ouster in 1986 -- the company was one of Asia's first.\n\nWith Reyes still with the company as artistic director, it remains on a short list of developing nations that have their own ballet troupes including Vietnam, China, Cuba and Brazil.\n\nTo open its 50th season in August, principal dancer Evgeny Ivanchenko and first soloist Elena Evseeva of Russia's famed Mariinsky Ballet, previously the Kirov Ballet, starred alongside local dancers in the Filipino troupe's \"Swan Lake\" gala night.\n\nThe production evoked the glitter of Ballet Philippines' first decade, when the likes of legends Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Patrick Bissell danced for the company in Manila.\n\nThe troupe's reputation continues to pack a punch.\n\nChris Millado, Cultural Center of the Philippine's artistic director, says: \"It is one of the best in Asia.\"", "description": "From fierce typhoons and tight budgets to losing its dancers to cruise ships and theme parks, Ballet Philippines has weathered almost every type of storm,...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/05/wire-19870318-1571374075-448_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
