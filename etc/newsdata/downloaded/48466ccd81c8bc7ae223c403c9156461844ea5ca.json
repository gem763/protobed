Kupperman reportedly aligns closely with Bolton\u2019s hawkish approach toward foreign policy and intervention, suggesting that his tenure as acting national security adviser may be short-lived.\n\n\n\nTRUMP OUSTS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON, SAYS THEY 'DISAGREED STRONGLY' ON POLICY\n\nIn January, Trump cited Kupperman\u2019s \"more than four decades of national security policy and program experience\" when he first appointed him to his national security team, according to Business Insider.\n\nAt the time, Bolton said in a White House statement that \"Charlie Kupperman has been an advisor to me for more than thirty years, including during my tenure as National Security Advisor to President Trump. ... Charlie\u2019s extensive expertise in defense, arms control and aerospace will help further President Trump's national security agenda.\"\n\nThe choice of Kupperman was opposed, however, by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a leading Muslim civil rights group that immediately called for Kupperman\u2019s resignation, citing his nearly a decade-long tenure with the Center for Security Policy (CSP), which CAIR regards as \"an anti-Muslim hate group.\"\n\nKupperman was a member of CSP\u2019s board from 2001 to 2011. The group was founded by Frank Gaffney Jr., another former member of the Reagan adminsitraion, Business Insider reported.
