Are you thinking about jumping ship toward greener pastures? Glassdoor, an online job and recruiting site, has revealed the highest paying companies in 2019. Just as it dominated Glassdoor\u2019s highest paying jobs list, tech dominates the highest paying companies list as well. Twenty of the 25 top-paying companies are in tech.\n\nPalo Alto Networks \u2014 a multinational cybersecurity company headquartered in Santa Clara, California \u2014 takes the top spot in 2019, with a median annual salary of $170,929. NVIDIA (NVDA), Twitter (TWTR), Gilead Sciences (GILD), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) follow, in that order.\n\nGraphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nThese companies not only share an industry, they also share a home: the San Francisco Bay Area. \u201cThese big tech employers are battling fiercely with each other to offer competitive salaries to hire and retain really skilled workers,\u201d says Amanda Stansell, Glassdoor\u2019s senior research analyst.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a job at one of these high paying companies but don\u2019t live in the Bay Area, hope is not lost. \u201cMany of these companies have offices all over the United States. So you don\u2019t have to be located in California to work at one of the highest paying companies,\u201d Stansell tells Yahoo Finance.\n\nIt is without question that salary is an important consideration for job seekers, but Glassdoor\u2019s research shows that pay is actually not among the leading factors when it comes to long-term employee satisfaction. In fact, when it comes to being satisfied in their day-to-day work, three factors matter most: Culture and values, trust in senior leadership and career opportunities. \u201cSo while pay is important,\u201d Stansell said, \u201cit shouldn\u2019t be the only factor you consider when applying for a job.\u201d\n\nReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
