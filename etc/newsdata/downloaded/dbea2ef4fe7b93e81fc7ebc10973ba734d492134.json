He lived up to his name and he is a great fighter.\n\n\"I knew I could beat him with the jab alone, but he had me himself so respect to him.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nPrograis added: \"The better man won on the night. No excuses, but I will be back. I am pretty sure Josh enjoyed it, hopefully we can do part two.\"\n\nPrograis had got off to a positive start and was finding his southpaw jab to be his best weapon, enjoying success as he rocked the Scot.\n\nDespite having height and reach advantage, Taylor was finding his best offence was coming as he got in close to Prograis as the momentum slowly shifted back his way.\n\nBut every time that Taylor connected with his left, Prograis was shaking it off and insisting it was not bothering him.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nOne cute counter jab rocked the New Orleans native in the fifth and it was from there that Taylor began to dominate.\n\nA right hook at the start of the seventh got the crowd going, but a big left in the eighth reminded Taylor that the job was not done.\n\nBoth men were cut in the closing stages and Prograis caused further damage in the final round, but Taylor was able to hold on to get the nod by the judges.", "description": "Taylor secured a fairytale victory in front of a sell-out crowd cheering him on at the O2 Arena in London", "authors": ["Aaron Flanagan", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733729.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Regis-Prograis-v-Josh-Taylor-WBSS-Final-WBA-World-WBC-Diamond-IBF-World-WBC-Silver-Super-Lig.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
