Eventually, another individual steps in and pulls the student away from the teacher.\n\nReports said the teacher was taken to Grady Hospital and treated for minor injuries. He was released soon after.\n\nThe Atlanta Public Schools (APS) said in a statement regarding the alleged assault that \u201cthe safety and security of students and staff is a top priority in APS.\u201d\n\nReports said that following the altercation, an APS police officer arrested the student and tried to place him in the Fulton County Juvenile Detention Center after charging him with assault. However, the detention center refused to take him into custody so the teenager was handed over to his parent.\n\n\u201cBoth students involved in the initial altercation will face discipline in line with the APS code of student conduct,\u201d WJCL 22 reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, Breitbart News reported that APS had banned two softball teams from participating in the state playoffs after a fight between the two teams broke out last week, causing parents and other attendees to rush the field.\n\nIn a written statement, APS spokesman, Ian Smith, wrote that students and parents are required to follow the school\u2019s code of conduct while engaging in activities on school property.\n\n\u201cThis decision to have both teams forgo the postseason was a difficult one. However, all students, student athletes and parents representing APS are required to adhere to a code of conduct that calls for respect and appropriate behavior at school or on school property at any time,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "A high school teacher was taken to the hospital after he was allegedly beaten by a student in his classroom in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-971283990-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
