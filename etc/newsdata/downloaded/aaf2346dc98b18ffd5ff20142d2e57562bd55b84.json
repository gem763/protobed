The party paid $700,000 to former general secretary Kaila Murnain, who has resigned over a political donations scandal. Labor has also been forced to forfeit the $100,000 cash gift at the centre of the inquiry. The auditor's report outlines a serious cash flow issue, triggering speculation it will be forced to find new ways to bolster party coffers, according to The Australian newspaper.
