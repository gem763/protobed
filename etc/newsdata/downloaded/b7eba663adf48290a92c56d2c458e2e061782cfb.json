Yemen's Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen's civil war, has claimed responsibility.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking to CNN, said the attack on Saudi oil facilities was an attack on the world economic system. He said the United States expects that any country attached to the U.S. dollar system will abide by the sanctions on Iran.\n\nTrump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year and ramped up sanctions to strangle its oil exports, a mainstay of the Iranian economy.\n\nThe move dismantled part of former U.S. President Barack Obama's legacy and upset U.S. allies who were party to the agreement, which was designed to restrict Tehran's pathway to a nuclear bomb in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump had weighed the possibility of easing sanctions on Iran and suggested he could meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is due to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York this week. Rouhani has said that Iran, which denies seeking nuclear weapons, would not talk to the United States until Washington lifted sanctions.", "description": "The United States aims to avoid war with Iran and the additional troops ordered to be deployed in the Gulf region are for \"deterrence and defense,\" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106142895-1569162338573gettyimages-1167242151.jpeg?v=1569162417", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
