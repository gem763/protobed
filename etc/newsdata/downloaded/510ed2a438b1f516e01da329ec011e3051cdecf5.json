We can see that he has a plan and it\u2019s just going to take a little bit of time to get into place, but they need to back him and give him the time that he needs, because changing the manager in a few months will only set us back to square one again.\u201d\n\nSharpe added: \u201cI would have gone for Pochettino and signed out his buyout clause. I don\u2019t think he was happy at Tottenham.\u201d\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer Man Utd\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current Spurs boss continues to be linked with a move to Old Trafford, as questions are asked of Solskjaer, while a one-time rival of United has also been mooted as a possible candidate to fill a prominent post.\n\nEx-Arsenal boss Wenger is, however, considered to be an unrealistic option in the eyes of Sharpe.\n\nHe said of the iconic Frenchman, who spent 22 years in charge of the Gunners: \u201cI think he\u2019s too Arsenal. I think he is a great manager, very wise and knowledgeable about the game, and I think he probably would have been good for United, but he\u2019s just too Arsenal. He was there for too long and too much of the Arsenal furniture.\u201d\n\nWhomever guides United forward, be that Solskjaer or somebody else, Sharpe admits there is a big job to be done at Old Trafford.\n\nHe has not been convinced by some of the transfer business overseen of late, with the decision to sell Romelu Lukaku to Inter over the summer one of a number of puzzling calls.\n\nSharpe added: \u201cI think there have got to be regrets, as they are short in the centre-forward department anyway. Lukaku is a proven goalscorer and the only issue with Lukaku is the way the team play and set up. You need to play to his strengths, and his strengths were not like a Mark Hughes who played with his back to goal and holds the ball up.\n\n\u201cLukaku is better playing on the shoulder of the defender, looking for the ball in behind and over the top, looking for crosses coming into the box and at the moment, United seem to be wanting to play that way to Lukaku\u2019s strengths, but they haven\u2019t kept him and wanted him to be a part of that. Ole had different ideas and evidently wants to go down a different route with the players that he has got, but without being able to buy someone in the summer, I think it was a huge mistake.\u201d", "description": "The former Red Devils winger remains unconvinced by the man in the dugout at Old Trafford and has questioned the decision to offload Romelu Lukaku", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WMCPChi6Uei.F6qVnYWHCQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RYXjNMRDqLQOWQF.8Zi4NA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/56a54e5987374a052f703ba3c7e6dd2b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
