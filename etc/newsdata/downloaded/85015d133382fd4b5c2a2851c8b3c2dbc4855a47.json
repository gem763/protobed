He is literally ending Real Valladolid all on his own. pic.twitter.com/8y9QrpFOsK \u2014 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc02 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc09\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc17 \ud83d\udc8e (@TheEuropeanLad) October 29, 2019\n\nMessi took his soul away with that nutmeg \ud83d\ude35 pic.twitter.com/rBLFJm6IRG \u2014 Prime Foootball (@PFoootball) October 30, 2019\n\nI see no shame in being nutmegged by Lionel Messi... It would be an honour. Something to tell the Grandchildren. \u2014 John Bennett (@JohnBennettBBC) October 29, 2019\n\nMessi is having one of those game, unfortunately for Valladolid! He just made 80,000 people gasp at the same time in the stadium with a nutmeg in his own defensive third on Oscar Plano. Plano will probably show his grandkids in 20 yrs time \ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Terry Gibson (@TerryGibson88) October 29, 2019\n\nMessi endured a difficult start to his La Liga season as injuries impacted his ability to play consistently, but with those ailments now apparently behind him it seems as though the Argentine magician is getting back to his best.\n\nMessi scored twice in the win against Valladolid \u2013 including the 50th free-kick goal of his career \u2013 and also provided a stunning through ball for an Arturo Vidal strike. The win takes Barcelona back to the top of La Liga, two points clear of this season's surprise package Granada.", "description": "Oscar Plano couldn't hide his humiliation at being the latest La Liga victim of a Lionel Messi nutmeg during Real Madrid's thrashing of Real Valladolid on Tuesday evening, and social media revelled in his misfortune.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db970c32030273c9c4fbdca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
