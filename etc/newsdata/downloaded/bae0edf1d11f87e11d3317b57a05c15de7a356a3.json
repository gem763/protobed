An emerging middle class of Bolivians would beg to differ.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cNow we have the dignity of toilets. Our lives are nothing like they were before.\u201d\n\nFor years now, opponents of socialism have pointed at collapsing Venezuela as Exhibit A in the argument against the political left. But here in the shadow of the Andes, Bolivians are living the mirror image: an upwardly mobile society where, at least on paper, socialism has worked.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCritics of President Evo Morales, a 59-year-old socialist whose image pops up on T-shirts in left-wing cafes from La Paz to Paris, say Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous head of state has co-opted its young democracy, weakened its institutions and abused his authority to run for another term in office this month.\n\nBut 13 years after his Movement for Socialism won at the ballot box, it\u2019s indisputable that Bolivians are healthier, wealthier, better educated, living longer and more equal than at any time this South American nation\u2019s history.\n\nAs Morales seeks a fourth term in the elections Sunday, his Bolivia is serving as a counterpoint to Venezuela in the hemispheric debate over socialism \u2014 a now-loaded word that has become a flash point in the U.S. presidential race.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe state will not be able to solve all problems,\u201d Morales told The Washington Post. \u201cThe state as the head of investment, accompanied by the private sector \u2014 that is the model of socialism we have.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMorales came to power with Chavez, Correa and Kirchner\n\nIf Morales has talked at times like a militant, he has behaved like a pragmatist \u2014 nationalizing firms such as the communications giant Entel, while allowing private competition to keep it on its toes.\n\nBolivia\u2019s socialism lite has led to distortions and left some private firms crying foul. The country was the poorest in South America when Morales took office in 2006. By most measures, it still is.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe still have children dying of malnutrition,\u201d said Shirley Franco Rodr\u00edguez, a vice presidential candidate now challenging Morales\u2019s socialists. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the Venezuela-ization of Bolivia. We will have an economic collapse if Morales does not go.\u201d\n\nYet under Morales, data shows, Bolivia\u2019s economy is closing the gap with the rest of the continent, growing faster than most neighbors over the past 13 years. Meanwhile, governments that have embraced market policies \u2014 notably, in Argentina and Ecuador \u2014 are facing both economic and political chaos.\n\nAD\n\nChile, the South American model for capitalism\u2019s success, still reigns as the region\u2019s richest and most stable economy. Yet even the International Monetary Fund, that champion of the free market, concedes that Bolivia\u2019s socialists have been more effective in combating extreme poverty than any other South American government, slashing it from 33 percent of the population in 2006 to 15 percent in 2018.\n\nAD\n\nCritics say any nation that enjoyed such a massive increase in revenue from the commodities boom could have achieved those results. Now, they note, Bolivia faces fresh challenges from the drop in the price of natural gas, the country\u2019s largest export. After years of budget surpluses, the country is running deficits, and concern is rising that the fixed exchange rate and big-state bureaucracy are stifling any real chance of transitioning to a modern, export-oriented economy.\n\nMorales came to power in 2006 as a member of the left-wing Latin American posse that included Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Ecuador\u2019s Rafael Correa and Argentina\u2019s Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Now he\u2019s the last man standing \u2014 and faces the challenge of his political life.\n\nAD\n\nMorales won reelection easily in 2009 and 2014. Polls suggest he\u2019ll have a harder time now \u2014 and could lose if the vote goes to a second round. He\u2019s running largely on his \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d: using prudent fiscal management and state investment to transform the country.\n\nAD\n\nHe took a very different approach from Venezuela, headed by his close ally Ch\u00e1vez, and now embattled President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (whom he still defends).\n\nIn Venezuela, the socialist state has seized 10 million acres of private land, expropriated 1,365 companies and purchased 5,000 more. Bolivia, by contrast, has avoided large-scale land seizures and nationalized just 33 companies \u2014 most of which had been state-owned before they were sold off by earlier governments.\n\nMorales\u2019s government stands accused of corruption \u2014 in one prominent case, an ex-girlfriend was convicted and sentenced to 10 years; he denied wrongdoing \u2014 but not on the scale of Venezuela\u2019s socialists. Bolivia ranks 132 of 180 countries in Transparency International\u2019s most recent Corruption Perceptions Index, tied with neighboring Paraguay and ahead of Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBillions of dollars have been funneled into infrastructure projects that have transformed society: new schools, futuristic mass transit and 3,354 miles of new roads.\n\n\u201cPoverty has declined substantially because of public investment, and Bolivia has outpaced most South American countries,\u201d said John Crabtree, research associate for the Latin American Center at the University of Oxford. \u201cIt\u2019s a transformation from a low base, but what we\u2019ve seen is a reduction of poverty and the emergence of what some people would call a middle class.\u201d\n\n\u2018I support Evo, but I\u2019m no socialist\u2019\n\nThe progress is perhaps most visible in La Paz and El Alto, cities with a combined population of 2.3 million high in the snow-capped Andes mountains. Here, socialism gave new agency to Bolivia\u2019s indigenous majority.\n\nAD\n\nTen new cable car lines built by Morales\u2019s socialists now span the sister cities, sharply cutting commutes from poor neighborhoods to job-rich commercial zones. Entel, headquartered in a teeming business district, has thrived \u2014 turning regular profits while competing successfully against private firms to claim nearly half the national market.\n\nAD\n\nEntel pays its chief executive $4,310 a month, 8.5 times more than its lowest-paid employees. The heads of its two largest competitors make $25,862 and $12,931 \u2014 64 and 32 times their lowest-paid workers, according to government statistics.\n\n\u201cThere are executives who want to earn a lot, but that\u2019s not our way,\u201d said Oscar Coca, Bolivia\u2019s head of public works and a former chief executive of Entel. \u201cWe have encouraged competition and efficiency, but also social fairness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn El Alto, one of the globe\u2019s highest cities at 13,615 feet, entire neighborhoods have been made over by a rising class of indigenous and mixed-race entrepreneurs. They say Morales broke a glass ceiling in business for nonwhite people, as state-private partnerships helped them build up their own firms.\n\nStreets once filled with humble brick homes are now lined with cholets \u2014 lavish mansions with offices and residential space whose whimsical designs and earthy tones hark back to the archaeological ruins of lost indigenous civilizations. The name combines the sometimes derogative word for a traditional indigenous person (cholo) with chalet.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI support Evo, but I\u2019m no socialist,\u201d said Eynar Viscarra, 42, speaking on the sprawling terrace of his home, fitted with outdoor chandeliers. The son of a bus driver now runs an import company that capitalized on the new roads to rural areas. He\u2019s building a mall in El Alto that\u2019s poised to bring the world\u2019s highest branches of Nike and Adidas to a growing Bolivian middle class.\n\n\u201cI mean, is China socialist? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cNot really. Look, the point is, Bolivia is not Venezuela. We have not made their enormous mistakes.\u201d\n\nUsing cash from the natural gas industry wrung from foreign investors \u2014 most of whom nevertheless remained profitable and have stayed in Bolivia \u2014 Morales\u2019s government lifted up neighborhoods such as Huancan\u00e9, an enclave of more than 3,000 working-class indigenous people transformed by government investment.\n\nAD\n\nWith new stone roads, the neighborhood is now accessible by minibus, connecting residents to the world\u2019s highest mass transit system \u2014 the aerial cable cars.\n\n\u201cI used to go out with two pairs of shoes when I went to work,\u201d said 48-year-old Levearia Kachi, a single mother who works as a maid in the city. \u201cI had one pair to walk through the mud roads, and another pair to put on once I arrived at work.\n\n\u201cBut now we have roads \u2014 real roads! \u2014 and I can walk out with one pair of clean shoes.\u201d\n\nBut even in hardcore Morales country, the people are demanding more.\n\n\u201cWe need a school, a health clinic, a police station!\u201d exclaimed Mar\u00eda Dolores Cruz Garnica, a 50-year old merchant. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved in the right direction, but not by enough.\u201d\n\nMorales\u2019 critics note that not all nationalized firms are doing as well as Entel. His opponents say the presidential palace gives preferential treatment to state firms.\n\n\u201cWe may have a new middle class, but what is it built on?\u201d asked Ibo Blazicevic, president of Bolivia\u2019s National Chamber of Industries. \u201cWe have huge losses in potential profits due to corruption, and we have to make adjustments in the size of the state. It just isn\u2019t sustainable.\u201d\n\nMorales, capitalizing on a fractured opposition and a strong economy, won his last two terms with more than 60 percent of the vote. But polls suggest victory Sunday is by no means certain.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t secure 40 percent of the vote with a 10-point margin, he\u2019ll face a runoff on Dec. 15 that could finally see opposing parties unite against him. His strongest opponent is former president Carlos Mesa. Some polls indicate Mesa could beat Morales if the vote goes to a second round.\n\nMorales is facing criticism for even running. In 2016, he gambled on a national referendum that would allow him to sidestep term limits and seek a fourth term. He narrowly lost that vote, amid a scandal over allegedly fathering a child out of wedlock \u2014 but then secured a court ruling that\u2019s enabling him to run again.\n\nHis opponents call that an abuse of power \u2014 one that fits an authoritarian pattern they say has also included heavy-handedness with anti-development protesters (many of them indigenous), the press and political opponents. Reporters Without Borders ranks Bolivia 113 of 180 countries in its 2019 Press Freedom Index, behind many of its neighbors but ahead of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela.\n\nMorales rejects the criticisms.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve also called me a dictator,\u201d he told The Post, and tossed his hands in the air.\n\n\u201cI think that, for my opposers, this is an issue of class. They cannot accept that an indigenous man is president.\u201d", "description": "The Andean nation has lifted people out of poverty at a faster rate than any other country in South America.", "authors": ["Anthony Faiola", "Correspondent Covering Latin America", "Venezuela", "Argentina", "Brazil", "Human Rights", "Poverty", "Globalization"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2dK4V6qiWcKQjSOKLPM9Cu2WwwE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X6HKLRHJ3MI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
