This would seem to defy logic, and yet many grape varieties key to the world\u2019s wine producers remain a mystery to most oenophiles. These grapes may not be household names like Merlot or Cabernet, but they\u2019re responsible for some very solid, very drinkable and occasionally even great wines. I consider the following grapes particularly deserving of a bit of acclaim.\n\nThe phrase \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d comes to mind as a fitting description of the Bobal grape. It\u2019s actually the second-most-planted red grape in Spain after the much more famous Tempranillo (the star of Rioja).\n\nThe dark-skinned Bobal grape remains unfamiliar to many oenophiles in part because it\u2019s grown in two unheralded wine regions: Utiel-Requena in Valenica and Manchuela southeast of Madrid. Historically it\u2019s been blended with other grapes and/or used to produce simple bulk wines. But recently a handful of producers have focused on making more interesting and serious wines from the Bobal grape, finally giving it a star turn.\n\nOne man in particular, Juan Antonio Ponce at Bodegas Ponce, has been recognized for his efforts with the grape. His Bobal wines, proudly bearing the name of the grape on their labels, are structured but lush, with aromas of red fruit and spice. Here\u2019s hoping more producers follow suit.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What are your favorite wine grapes \u2014 obscure or otherwise? Join the conversation below.\n\nBonarda\n\nIt seems every wine drinker in the world loves, or at least knows, Malbec, the French grape that has become the star red variety of Argentina. Though almost as prolific, the Argentine Bonarda grape is known and loved by Argentine winemakers alone.\n\nBonarda ranks just behind Malbec in terms of planted vineyard acreage in Argentina and has grown there for hundreds of years. A century ago Bonarda was almost as highly regarded as Malbec. Laura Catena, whose family helped put Malbec on the map, recalled that her great-grandfather Nicola Catena actually preferred Bonarda over Malbec.\n\nMs. Catena, who divides her time between California and Argentina, makes a Bonarda under the La Posta label. She said she \u201clove, love, loves\u201d the Bonarda grape for its fruit-forward character and \u201cItalian-style\u201d tannins (i.e., soft). The Catena family also recently released a new Bonarda wine.\n\nOther Argentine winemakers have embraced Bonarda as well. Leonardo Erazo, technical director of Altos Las Hormigas in Mendoza, calls it a \u201cversatile\u201d grape well suited to the sunny climate of Mendoza. His Colonia Las Liebres Bonarda has a fresh and fruity character with a bright natural acidity\u2014a bit like Gamay, the grape of Beaujolais.\n\nFrappato\n\nDespite a name that sounds like a fast-paced dance, the Frappato grape has been slow to gain fame outside its native Sicily. Much like Bonarda, this red grape is beloved by local winemakers but little known to the world at large. It\u2019s not always easy to find in stores.\n\nOne Frappato producer who stands out, in terms of both quality and production numbers: Valle dell\u2019Acate. According to proprietor Gaetana Jacono, the Frappato grape was the source of the very first wine her family produced back in the late 19th century and was once the sole grape in the family\u2019s Cerasuolo di Vittoria wines. Today their Cerasuolo wines contain a blend of Frappato and the much better known Nero d\u2019Avola grape.\n\nMs. Jacono loves the fresh character and bright acidity of Frappato, which she said can even pair well with seafood such as salmon, tuna and fish soup with mussels. This grape is as versatile\u2014light and lively with a delightful bitter-cherry aroma\u2014as it is easy to love.\n\n\u201c \u2018These grapes may not be household names, but they\u2019re responsible for some very drinkable and even great wines.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMelon de Bourgogne\n\nThe name sounds like a geographic mix-up. After all, this is the grape of Muscadet in the Loire Valley, hundreds of miles from Bourgogne.\n\nMelon de Bourgogne did originate in Burgundy, hundreds of years ago, but the Burgundians were less than enthused\u2014apparently it didn\u2019t ripen reliably\u2014and so they ripped it out. The Dutch, however, thought they could make Melon de Bourgogne work in a different spot. They transported the grape to the area around Nantes, then home to mostly red grapes, and used it to make a fortified wine. Apparently the Melon de Bourgogne flourished and survived the harsh winters (unlike the red grapes). It has remained there ever since.\n\nToday Melon de Bourgogne and Muscadet are virtually synonymous, even if wine drinkers who drink bottles of $10 Muscadet have never actually heard of the latter, since it doesn\u2019t appear on the label. This grape can produce wines that range from simple crisp whites to intensely minerally examples that resemble a first-rate Chablis.\n\nOne producer whose wines fall into the second category, Domaine Pierre Luneau-Papin, makes a special Terre de Pierre bottling, Chablis-like with a penetrating minerality and electric acidity. It\u2019s also one of the world\u2019s great deals\u2014about $25 a bottle\u2014a fraction of the price of a top white Burgundy.\n\nPecorino\n\nThe white grape of Italy\u2019s Marche region, wasn\u2019t named after the sheep\u2019s milk cheese pecorino but, rather, after the sheep (pecore) themselves, as apparently they once gorged on the grape. At least that\u2019s what Paola Massi of Azienda Agricola Fiorano winery, in the Marche, told me in an email.\n\nAccording to Ms. Massi, the Pecorino grape was nearly forgotten a few decades ago, save for a handful of producers growing it around Ascoli Piceno, where the variety first appeared. Happily, recent years have brought a revival, and it\u2019s even planted a few other places in Italy including Abruzzo. Now, according to Ms. Massi, it is one of the \u201cmost requested\u201d grapes of the Marche region. Her bright, lively, slightly bitter Fiorano Donna Orgilla Pecorino is one of my favorite expressions of this sheep-favored grape.\n\nEmail Lettie at wine@wsj.com\n\nOENOFILE / Varietals Ready for their Close-Up\n\nPhoto: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal\n\n2017 Bodegas y Vi\u00f1edos Ponce La Estrecha Bobal $25\n\nThis lithe and fairly light bodied wine made from the Bobal grape is also notably lush. Produced from old vines grown in chalk soils, it's also fairly low in alcohol (12.5%), with lots of ripe berry fruit.\n\n2017 Valle dell\u2019Acate Il Frappato $20\n\nMade with the star red grape of southern Sicily by one of its very best producers, the Valle dell\u2019Acate Frappato is also a terrifically flexible wine with food thanks to a lively acidity and piquant bitter-red-cherry note.\n\n2018 Azienda Agricola Fiorano Donna Orgilla Pecorino $19\n\nThere is pecorino cheese made from sheep\u2019s milk cheese and then there is the white Pecorino grape of Italy\u2019s Marche region. The latter\u2019s charms are fully evident in this wine\u2019s citrus notes and crisp acidity.\n\n2018 Altos Las Hormigas Colonia Las Liebres Bonarda $10\n\nThis juicy, ripe wine produced by the Mendoza-based Altos Las Hormigas winery is a winning example of the Bonarda grape and an exuberant counterpart to Argentina\u2019s more serious and far more famous Malbec.\n\n2017 Domaine Luneau-Papin Terre de Pierre Muscadet S\u00e8vre & Maine sur Lie $25\n\nThis thrillingly mineral white shows a strong spiritual connection to Chablis and demonstrates the Melon de Bourgogne grape\u2019s deep affinity for the limestone soils of Nantes.", "description": "Do you hear \u201cPecorino\u201d and think cheese?
