The latest protests, which began over a now-withdrawn extradition bill but grew into demands for greater democracy and independence from mainland China, are mostly leaderless.\n\n\u201cWe hope ... for bipartisan support,\u201d Wong said of his trip to Washington, adding that U.S. lawmakers should demand the inclusion of a human rights clause in ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\nHe said he also hoped to convince members of Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would require an annual justification of the special treatment that for decades has been afforded to the Chinese-ruled city by Washington, including trade and business privileges.\n\nThe bill would also mean that officials in China and Hong Kong who undermined the city\u2019s autonomy could face sanctions. Democratic U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer said earlier this month that it would be a priority for U.S. Senate Democrats in their new session, which started on Monday.\n\nHong Kong returned to China from British rule in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina has accused foreign powers, especially the United States and Britain, of fuelling the unrest.\n\nThe latest protests, often involving violent clashes with police, have roiled Hong Kong for more than three months. Millions of people have taken to the city\u2019s streets, even shutting down its airport for two days. Demonstrators\u2019 demands include an independent inquiry into what they describe as police brutality and universal suffrage.\n\nThere were clashes in the Kowloon Bay area on Saturday. But the unrest was minor compared with previous weeks when protesters attacked the legislature and Liaison Office, the symbol of Chinese rule, trashed metro stations and set street fires. Police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nChina is eager to quell the protests before the 70th anniversary on Oct. 1 of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The nation has not involved its military in efforts to quash the protests.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nWong said the Hong Kong people would keep fighting for their cause through the anniversary.\n\n\u201cWe will continue our protest with our course on free elections,\u201d he said. \u201cI see no reason for us to give up and it\u2019s time for the world to stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n(The story corrects reference to \u201ccity-state\u201d in paragraph 4)", "description": "Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said on Saturday he was seeking the support of U.S. lawmakers for the demands of his fellow protesters who have led months of streets demonstrations, including a call for free elections.", "authors": ["Gabriella Borter", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429886222&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0PU", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
