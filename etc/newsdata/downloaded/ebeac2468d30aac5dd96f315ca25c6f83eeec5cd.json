Reuters/Jim Young\n\nGuglielmi had said Thursday that \"there were no charges of intoxication, no information of intoxication as far as I know.\"\n\nJohnson told reporters Thursday evening that he was driving home at about 12:30 that morning, after having let his driver go home to his family, when he felt lightheaded. He said he pulled over and fell asleep.\n\nThe responding officers found Johnson slumped over but allowed him to drive home and did not administer a breathalyzer test or a field sobriety test. Johnson said officers do such tests only when a motorist appears impaired or officers smell alcohol or cannabis.\n\nHe said the medical episode was the result of not following doctor's orders.\n\n\"When he adjusted my medication, I took the old medication for high blood pressure, but I failed to put the new medication in,\" he said.\n\nDuring a news conference with then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel in early 2017, Johnson had to be helped to a seat after he wobbled and appeared to be about ready to fall to the ground.\n\nA protester walks past a line of police officers standing guard in front of the District 1 police headquarters in Chicago, Illinois November 24, 2015.

Earlier this year he was hospitalized for a blood clot.\n\nIn her comments, Lightfoot said that Johnson told her about how he had just changed medication, and said she has \"no reason to doubt\" his account of what happened.\n\n\"We know he's had some medical issues,\" she told the Sun-Times. \"He's on the other side of a kidney (transplant) operation, which is obviously very, very serious. There have been some issues with high blood pressure, and so forth.\"\n\nShe also said that she knows from dealing with her parents that certain medications have side effects. \"So I take him at his word.\"\n\nShe also did not condemn Johnson for having some drinks with dinner. \"He's a grown man,\" she said. \"He had a couple of drinks with dinner.\"\n\nChicago Police Supt.

He said he wanted to take steps that would assure the public that his account was accurate.\n\nThe investigation into Johnson will be handled by the public integrity unit within the department's internal affairs division, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Friday. That unit is comprised of officers who are detailed to the FBI and work out of the FBI's Chicago office.\n\n\"If they have any sense that there was any impropriety, they would refer the case to outside investigative agencies,\" Guglielmi added.", "description": "Officers on Thursday night responded to a 911 call reporting a man asleep in a car at a stop sign.
