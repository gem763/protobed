TSMC and GlobalFoundries will cross-license each other's patents as well as those patents that will be filed during the next ten years, the companies said in a joint statement. U.S.-based GlobalFoundries sued TSMC in August and had listed Apple (O: ), Qualcomm Inc (O: ), Alphabet Inc's (O: ) Google, Nvidia Corp (O: ), Lenovo Group (HK: ) and Taiwan's MediaTek Inc (TW: ) among TSMC customers affected by the complaints. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, counter-sued earlier this month saying the U.S. firm has infringed 25 of its patents.\n\nTSMC, GlobalFoundries settle patent disputes", "description": "TSMC, GlobalFoundries settle patent disputes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9R1NM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
