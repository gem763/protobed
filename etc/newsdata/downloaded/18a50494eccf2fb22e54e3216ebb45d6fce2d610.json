His sign read, \u201cBusch Light supply needs replenished\" and included information on how to send him money through Venmo, the popular money transfer app.\n\nBUSCH BEER MATCHES DONATION AFTER FAN ACCIDENTALLY RAISES THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS: 'THIS IS THE BEST THING WE HAVE READ ALL YEAR'\n\nKing ended up receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars he decided to donate to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital. Soon after, Busch Light decided to match the donation \u2014 and said they would send King a year's supply of beer with his face on the can.\n\nBut after King's good deed was picked up by media outlets, a reporter at the Des Moines Register working on a profile of King discovered two racist jokes he had posted in 2012, when he was 16 years old, reportedly based on something from Comedy Central's \"Tosh.0,\" \"comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the Holocaust.\"\n\nKing went out of his way to express remorse and Busch Light cut ties with him.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds announced that Saturday, Sept. 28, 2019, was \"Carson King Day\" in the midwestern state.\n\n\u201cIndividuals like Carson King demonstrate how \u2018Iowa Nice\u2019 isn\u2019t just a slogan, but our way of life,\u201d the proclamation states. \"Carson King can showcase who we are as a people, not only by selflessly donating to a worthy cause, but spreading the message of generosity.\"\n\nDES MOINES REGISTER REPORTEDLY FACES THREATS, ADDS POLICE PRESENCE AFTER STORY BACKLASH\n\nKing said he's now trying to raise $2 million for the University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nAdditionally, Iowa's Geneseo Brewing Company said they were \"appalled\" by the Des Moines Register and Anheuser Busch's actions, saying that people grow and change.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We have witnessed your growth through your later social media content and accept your apologies,\" the brewing company stated. \"We believe that your selfless act to raise funds for the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital is a truly noble act.\"\n\nThe company subsequently said they named a new Pilsner beer called \"Iowa Legend\" after him, and planned to donate $1 \"from every pint and 16-ounce can sold to your cause until the batch is sold out.\"", "description": "Carson King,\u00a0the man who raised over $1 million for children's charity after\u00a0asking for beer money on television\u00a0and\u00a0was later called out for old tweets,\u00a0is still getting\u00a0a day and a beer named after him in his home state of Iowa.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
