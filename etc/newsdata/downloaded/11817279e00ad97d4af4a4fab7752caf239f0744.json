And it continued to defend the safety of plane after the accidents.", "description": "The chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, faced a second day of questions from Congress over the 737 Max crashes.", "authors": ["David Gelles", "Natalie Kitroeff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/business/30boeing3/30boeing3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
