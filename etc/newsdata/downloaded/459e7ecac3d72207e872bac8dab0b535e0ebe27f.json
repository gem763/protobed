Newsom signs law to change \u2018teledentistry\u2019 rules", "language": "en", "text": "SmileDirectClub shares tumbled 13% on Monday, bringing their one-month loss to 46%, after California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that includes key changes in the regulation of the company\u2019s \u201cteledentistry\u201d business model.\n\nBill 1519, a sunset bill for the Dental Board of California that extends its operations until Jan. 1, 2024, was signed late Sunday and will allow the board to continue to oversee and regulate dental services in the state. But it also includes protections for patients who undergo direct-to-consumer orthodontic treatment, such as that offered by SmileDirect SDC, -12.85%, including a provision that allows them to submit complaints to the Dental Board, even if they have signed nondisclosure agreements.\n\nThose protections were included after opposition to SmileDirect from dentists and orthodontists who have been critical of the company\u2019s business model. SmileDirect offers clear aligners by mail to customers using either a 3-D image of their teeth taken at a so-called Smile Shop or from an impression made using an online kit. The company then develops and ships the clear aligners \u2014 a form of dental braces \u2014 back, and the customer undergoes a five- to 10-month treatment plan. Dentists say any orthodontic procedure requires a thorough exam because any mistake can cause permanent damage and even break teeth.\n\nIn signing the bill, Newsom criticized the use of a sunset bill to advance policy changes.\n\n\u201cWhile I am signing this legislation, sunset bills are not the appropriate vehicle for policy changes that lack broad stakeholder input,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cSuch proposals should be considered in separate legislation and evaluated accordingly. I will not look favorably upon any future regulatory sunset bills that include these provisions.\u201d\n\nSee also: Charcoal toothpastes are \u2018dangerous,\u2019 don\u2019t whiten and may cause decay\n\nSmileDirect welcomed his criticism but said the bill still \u201cwill create unnecessary hurdles and costs to Californians that need care but struggle to afford it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the company statement: \u201cThe undebated, clinically unsupported, and ill-advised policy changes that are included in this bill \u2014 a bill that was intended to reauthorize the Dental Board of California until last-minute policy additions were added \u2014 have created arbitrary barriers to technological innovation.\u201d\n\nThe California Dental Association disputed that account.\n\n\u201cIt is a complete and total mischaracterization by SmileDirectClub to say the policy changes in AB 1519 were \u201clast minute\u201d,\u201d said spokesman Richard Stapler. \u201cIn fact, they were amended into the bill on July 3 and were public for 10 weeks prior to its final passage.\u201d\n\nSmileDirect and other direct-to-consumer orthodontic companies waged an aggressive lobbying campaign through August and into September, he said. But five separate votes were taken in the State Senate and State Assembly prior to the bill landing on the governor\u2019s desk. \u201cThis is all a matter of public record,\u201d said Stapler.\n\nThere was deep concern that patients lacked basis protection and were being asked to sign NDAs, he said. The bill will now require that dentists providing teledentristry services disclose their full name and license number and review xrays before moving any teeth.\n\nSmileDirect said nothing in the bill requires the company to cease or modify its operations. The new bill will come into effect on Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nIn case you missed it: SmileDirectClub went public: 5 things to know about the teeth-straightening startup\n\nSmileDirect has faced strong opposition from medical organizations, including the American Dental Association and the American Association of Orthodontists, which have accused it of endangering patients and practicing medicine illegally.\n\nLast week, short seller Hindenburg Research published a report saying that the company has attracted more than 1,200 Better Business Bureau complaints in its five years of existence and that some of its practices have been deemed illegal by dental boards in Alabama and Georgia.\n\nFor more, read: SmileDirectClub stock falls then recovers after scathing report from short seller\n\nHindenburg founder Nathan Anderson said customers have been forced to perform emergency dentistry on themselves and described an aggressive sales culture that pressures employees to \u201csell a new smile\u201d to at least 70% of clients each month.\n\nSmileDirect responded with a statement criticizing \u201corganized dentistry\u201d and its \u201canti-competitive legal actions.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the company reiterated that sentiment.\n\nSee: Align Technology stock plummets more than 20% as China sales woes hit earnings forecast\n\n\u201cSimply put, this bill represents the dental lobby\u2019s thinly-veiled attempt to protect traditional dentistry at the expense of Californians, and Governor Newsom made the correct choice in issuing his strongly-worded rebuke of the tactics and policy that this bill represents,\u201d the company said.\n\nSmileDirect shares were trading 58% below their IPO price on Monday. The company went public on Sept. 12, and its stock fell 10.7% below the issue price at the open.\n\nLast week, on the day following the Hindenburg Research report, all 10 banks that participated in the company\u2019s initial public offering published notes on the stock, with all 10 rating it the equivalent of buy. The stock closed lower that day despite the bullish notes.\n\nSee: Just one day after a short seller slammed SmileDirectClub, all 10 banks on its IPO rate it a buy", "description": "SmileDirectClub shares tumbled 10% on Monday, bringing their one-month losses to 46%, after California Gov.
