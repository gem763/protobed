It was not easy. I\u2019m not crying, nothing changed,\u201d Mendy, who started in City\u2019s 8-0 league win over Watford last weekend, told City\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard in Barcelona and Manchester (during the rehabilitation period). All the physios helped me a lot. The fans can be sad, I can understand, but I can do nothing more than work hard.\u201d\n\nCity are without Mendy\u2019s compatriot Aymeric Laporte who underwent knee surgery this month while fellow defender John Stones is nursing a muscle problem.\n\n\u201cNow I hope everything is good and I can give everything to this club for a very long time. I\u2019m back with them now and I want to keep going in this way.... now I need rhythm.\u201d\n\nCity, who are five points behind leaders Liverpool after six league matches, visit 14th-placed Everton on Saturday.", "description": "Manchester City left back Benjamin Mendy is ready to soldier on after two serious knee injuries stalled his career at the club and the Frenchman is targeting a long run of games with the Premier League champions this season.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434485075&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0NB", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
