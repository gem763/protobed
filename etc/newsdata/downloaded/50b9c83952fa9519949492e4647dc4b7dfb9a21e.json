Of those, 14 are countries in the EU and all (even the U.K.) gave an overall positive response. Poland and Lithuania are the biggest EU enthusiasts, with 84 percent and 83 percent in favor.\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) Brexit, 54 percent of respondents in the U.K. said they have a favorable view of the EU, ahead of Greece (53 percent), the Czech Republic (52 percent) and France (51 percent).\n\nFurther afield, just 51 percent of people in the U.S. who took part in the survey have a positive view of the EU, with 27 percent having an unfavorable opinion (and a whopping 21 percent offering no opinion). Outside Europe, the most positive views of the bloc were in South Korea and the Philippines, where 80 percent and 70 percent of adults, respectively, have a favorable view.\n\nThe only two countries that have a mostly negative view of the EU were Russia (37 percent favorable versus 44 percent unfavorable) and Turkey (34 percent favorable versus 56 percent unfavorable).\n\nAccording to Pew, the share of people with a positive view of the EU has significantly increased since a similar survey 2013 in Ukraine, Israel, the Philippines, Lebanon, Turkey, South Korea, Argentina and Mexico, with big decreases in Brazil, Indonesia and Kenya (mainly due to changes in the number of people not expressing an opinion rather than a rise in negative views).", "description": "Share of people with a positive view of the EU has significantly increased since a similar survey in 2013.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "David M.
