So naturally, I questioned my own decisions.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I find it funny because I know neither of us would have done such thing but when you look at a blonde baby that comes out of a brown Mexican American mother, you wonder, even if it\u2019s yourself.\n\n\u201cThe reason why it was a huge shocker was because my husband and I had no idea that we inherited the albinism gene and that there are known relatives with albinism.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Edith Garcia)\n\n\u201cAfter she was born, my mother asked my grandfather if he knew of any relatives and he confirmed that there were, but they were at least five generations back.\n\n\"My husband's side was similar, distant cousins but not close enough to have known the possibilities.\"\n\nShe added: \"Tatiana knows that she is special; she is used to the attention that she gets from strangers and doesn't seem to mind it.\n\n\u201cShe knows it's mostly because of her white hair as that is what usually people say. I think it's important too for her to feel confident and know that she is special in her own way but still the same. So far, it seems like she gets it.\n\n\u201cMariah was four years old when she really started to notice people staring at her sister and asked why. I explained to her that a lot of people haven't seen a little girl with white hair and that is very special.\n\n\u201cShe is a great help to her little sister; we often remind her that Tatiana may need help transitioning to new locations. Mariah has had shirts stating that her little sister has albinism.\u201d\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Edith Garcia)\n\nShe added: \"I quickly learned that albinism was not very common amongst us and not a lot of people including myself knew anything about it.\n\n\u201cI have read and seen some very heartbreaking things towards people with albinism and that's when it clicked.\n\n\u201cI will do everything in my power to raise awareness for Tatiana and every person that follows her. We are in this albinism community and together we will raise awareness.\n\n\u201cI believe everything happens for a reason so being a mama to a little girl with albinism has always been God's plan.\n\n\u201cI have made it a point to teach anyone that comes across as interested and eager to learn with the continuous support of our friends and family.\n\n\u201cI think it's cute that she feels beautiful and knows how special she is but it is more important that she knows her inner beauty.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Alicia Andrews)\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Edith Garcia)\n\n\u201cWhile everyone can compliment her hair or looks, I will be behind the scenes telling her how smart, strong and kind she is.\n\n\u201cResearch; ask questions and become aware of albinism or any condition and how it affects people. Everyone is different and can be affected differently.\n\n\u201cThey do not have red eyes; it is the blood vessels that are visible due to the lack of pigmentation.\n\n\"Remember that they're born this way; they don't know any different. Identify their strengths and work on their difficulties, support them.\u201d", "description": "Edith Garcia even doubted herself and wondered who the baby's dad could be as she looked nothing like her or her husband", "authors": ["Liana Jacob", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "Edith Garcia", "Alicia Andrews"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743361.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Questioned-Paternity-Albinism.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
