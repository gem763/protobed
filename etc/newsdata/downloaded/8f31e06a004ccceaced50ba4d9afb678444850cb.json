REUTERS/Phil McCarten/File Photo\n\nWeinstein is due to stand trial in January on charges of rape and predatory assault of two women. He denies any non-consensual sex.\n\nReuters asked actors, directors and producers how much Hollywood has changed since October 2017. Below are their replies, edited for length and clarity.\n\nJULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say that I feel like men might be beginning to behave themselves a little bit better, and I say maybe. I\u2019m not saying they have definitively, but there is a new way of communicating, or a slightly new awareness, an awareness shift that\u2019s happened. It\u2019s in process. This job is not done. It will never be done, but I think there\u2019s a way of communicating that has improved, hopefully.\u201d\n\nPATRICIA ARQUETTE\n\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement - my sister was one of the first people to come out - and I think it\u2019s had a ripple effect all across the world, beyond Hollywood. Luckily there is more representation of women and women of color on television than there was before, but it\u2019s still not really equal yet ... Activists and people have been trying to get this work done for a long, long time, but the more we have this conversation, the more we ask for it, the more we talk about the need for it, the better. You have movies like \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 and \u2018Black Panther\u2019 busting box office records and then suddenly, all of a sudden, the world is like \u2018Oh, right, they could be successful.\u2019 The business is sometimes the last one to learn.\u201d\n\nBRAD PITT\n\n\u201cWe seem to work as a pendulum. We swing too far one way, then we find that sweet spot, and then we go too far back and we keep on this swing. But what is going on, which is positive, is that we\u2019re recalibrating our relationships, behaviors and workplace. It\u2019s long overdue and needed, and it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nMICHELLE WILLIAMS\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many changes within my industry, but not just within my industry ... I see it at my daughter\u2019s school. I see it in my friends\u2019 places of employment. I see it really everywhere, and it gives me great faith that the world that these girls are growing up in is going to be different than the one that you and I grew up in.\u201d\n\nANGELINA JOLIE\n\n\u201cI think we have very far to go. I think even in Hollywood there should have been an independent inquiry... There\u2019s a lot of focus about what they say women want and I would say it\u2019s not what we want. It\u2019s what we\u2019d like not to be done to us. Do not limit us to have an education, do not harm us whether it be at war or in our own homes, do not oppress us or try to control us, do not limit our possibilities as human beings and just let us be.\u201d\n\nKRISTEN STEWART\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this solidarity that is providing women with a chance to start finally telling their own stories and not being used as sort of tools to tell their stories through other people ... There are so many untapped resources and ways in which we can inhabit our own stories and repossess our narrative. (It) is fully doable right now and for the first time, like ever, so it is an exciting time for women in film, like, enormously.\u201d\n\nCARA DELEVINGNE\n\n\u201cI think the #MeToo movement has changed a lot, but like a lot of hashtag movements, the problem is that when you do a hashtag or something, people think it\u2019s fixed. But it\u2019s not. It hasn\u2019t really changed anything, because it\u2019s still happening.\u201d\n\nELISABETH MOSS\n\n\u201cFor me (on movie \u2018The Kitchen,\u2019) we had (director) Andrea (Berloff), three female leads, we also had (the) first female (director of photography), and it\u2019s almost one of those things now that\u2019s become natural because these women are the best at what they do, and that\u2019s why they were there and not because they\u2019re women ... It\u2019s just becoming more normalized, which I think is the best part of it.\u201d\n\nNICOLE KIDMAN\n\n\u201cCharlize (Theron), Margot (Robbie) and I just did a film - \u2018Bombshell\u2019 - which is about instigating change in terms of sexual harassment ... We hope that constantly talking about it changes it for the generations to come.\u201d\n\nJULIANNE MOORE\n\n\u201cBecause of Time\u2019s Up, (New York) Governor (Andrew) Cuomo has adopted the Time\u2019s Up safety agenda, which is really, really significant for every woman in New York state. New York is a much less progressive state than California, so when Time\u2019s Up New York got together we thought, \u2018What do we address here in our home state?\u2019 And we\u2019ve really been able to make changes (including) extend the statute of limitations on assault.\u201d\n\nMICHELLE PFEIFFER\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s been such a seismic shift in awareness in just a year. I think there\u2019s a long way to go but I do think quite a bit has happened already. Already all the conversations I\u2019ve had with women, we just didn\u2019t have those conversations before.\u201d\n\nMELISSA MCCARTHY\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at the beginning of a movement, and I think we have to keep pushing. You can talk a good game, but you have to wait until it changes, so we\u2019re not there yet. We will be. You\u2019ve got to root for it. I\u2019m a hopeful person. I have two daughters; I have to be. I\u2019ll fight. I\u2019ll fight until I can\u2019t fight anymore.\u201d\n\nELLE FANNING\n\n\u201cFor me, being a young woman in the industry and hearing actresses tell their story and being able to hear those voices and know that it\u2019s OK to speak your truth on things and stand up for what\u2019s right and say no - it\u2019s a great community that has really formed because of this.\u201d\n\nKIRSTIE ALLEY\n\n\u201cWhen we did \u2018Cheers,\u2019 ... if someone was in the bathroom, someone would kick open the door and we would take pictures, but the intent was in fun. And if the intent is to hold you hostage or not give you a job without sexual favors, you know the difference. But I think that the pendulum swung and now it needs to swing and balance out because people are not all ill-intentioned.\u201d\n\nJULIETTE BINOCHE\n\n\u201cI have been quite free, always, in my choices in life. I didn\u2019t need #MeToo to do that, but I think #MeToo\u2019s movement was very important for some people, for some women to speak out.\u201d\n\nRUTH NEGGA\n\n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be able to get away with inequality anymore. The thing is that you\u2019ve got to keep vocal about it; you\u2019ve got to be vigilant. It\u2019s not something that can ever be really done and dusted until there is equality and everybody\u2019s voice is heard.\u201d\n\nRICHARD LINKLATER\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just good everybody\u2019s aware. I mean, out with the old, right? The old status quo can\u2019t hold. There has to be these evolutionary leaps in what is acceptable.\u201d", "description": "This week marks two years since the New York Times and the New Yorker published accounts by multiple women accusing film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and a drive to empower women who work behind and in front of the camera.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436219372&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910VQ-OCAEN"}
