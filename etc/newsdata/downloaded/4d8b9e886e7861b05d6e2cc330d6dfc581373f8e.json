Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic presidential debate in Houston, Texas, September 12, 2019. (Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nTrump whistleblower lawyers Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid released a statement Friday offering \u201cto clarify some facts\u201d about their client, in light of recent reports that the whistleblower had professional ties to a Democratic candidate, later alleged to be Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cOur client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party,\u201d the statement reads. The whistleblower had been previously identified as a CIA analyst and registered Democrat before reports emerged that the unidentified official also worked for a Democratic presidential hopeful.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported this week that the whistleblower \u201chad a significant tie to one of the Democratic presidential candidates currently vying to challenge President Trump in next year\u2019s election.\u201d The whistleblower\u2019s political ties were reportedly revealed by Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson during a closed-door hearing on October 4. On Thursday, the paper cited unnamed CIA and former Trump officials who claimed the professional relationship was with Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThis person, after working with Biden, may feel defensive towards him because he feels [Biden] is being falsely attacked. Maybe he is even talking to Biden\u2019s staff. Maybe it is innocent, maybe not,\u201d a source told the Examiner.\n\nIn their letter, Bakal and Zaid state the whistleblower has served \u201cin apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch,\u201d and \u201chas come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials \u2014 not as candidates.\u201d\n\nThe document ends with an apparent jab at the Examiner. \u201cTo date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources. For that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant,\u201d it concludes.", "description": "Trump whistleblower lawyers Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid released a statement Friday offering \u201cto clarify some facts\u201d about their client.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
