It was the first time the country has ever had to hold consecutive elections, prompted by Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s inability to pull together a right-wing coalition last time around. Rather than let opposition parties attempt to form a coalition when he failed, Bibi dissolved parliament and forced the country back to the polls. He was rewarded with a second-place showing, leaving him in an even worse position than he was back in April.\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nBecause this looks like the end of the reign of \u201cKing Bibi\u201d\u2014as he is referred to by both supporters and detractors alike\u2014who surpassed David Ben-Gurion this summer to become the longest-serving Prime Minister in Israeli history. Netanyahu is a polarizing figure in Israeli society, more so in recent years as he has tacked to the right to retain his grip on power, employing racist language against the country\u2019s Arab citizens, attacking the media, police and the Supreme Court, and vowing to annex parts of the West Bank to appease his ultra-religious and far-right political partners (more on that below). Bibi is an unabashed political opportunist, but that same political opportunism has also allowed him to forge strong personal relationships with Israel\u2019s Arab neighbors\u2014particularly those that share his view of the existential threat posed to the region by Iran\u2014as well as with the Trump administration. And while those personal relationships have benefited Bibi politically, they\u2019ve also benefitted Israel a great deal, too.\n\nBut back to Israeli domestic politics. Over more than a decade in power, Netanyahu has presided over a country where the issue of how religious \u201cthe Jewish state\u201d should be has come to the forefront of Israeli politics. This is not a new fight by any means\u2014issues like the lack of civil marriages and the banning of public transport in major cities on Saturdays in honor of the Jewish Sabbath have long been sore points for the country\u2019s non-ultra-Orthodox majority who feel forced to live by the rules of the country\u2019s more religious elements. But the most explosive fight of late has come over the issue of mandatory conscription of the country\u2019s ultra-Orthodox population. Most men in that community who choose to study the Jewish scriptures full-time receive exemptions from military service, a practice that Israel\u2019s Supreme Court has in the past ruled unconstitutional for being discriminatory. The right-wing ultra-Orthodox parties that Netanyahu has partnered with insist that the practice continues, prompting Avigdor Lieberman, a former Netanyahu deputy and the head of the right-wing but stridently secular Yisrael Beitenu, to pull his support from the previous round of coalition talks. That made it impossible for Netanyahu to form a government and drove the country back to elections. Further adding to Bibi\u2019s headaches? He is waiting to hear this fall whether the country\u2019s attorney general will indict him on corruption charges.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nWhat Happens Next:\n\nThe country\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, has until October 2 to decide who will get first shot at forming a government. Netanyahu, Lieberman, and Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue & White party that won 33 seats to Likud\u2019s 31 (Israel\u2019s parliament has 120 seats total), all say they want the same thing: a national unity government, involving at least Likud and Blue & White. But that\u2019s easier said than done.\n\nThe most likely outcome is a national unity government led by Gantz, which would include elements of Likud that decide to abandon the severely weakened Netanyahu, as well as a constellation of other parties including Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beitenu and possibly center-left Labor. Lieberman would probably demand the defense ministry and key policy concessions to bless this government. It would be a motley bunch\u2014leftists and right wingers, hawks and doves, free marketeers and union bosses. But it would be a majority, and that\u2019s all Gantz needs.\n\nNetanyahu is not going down without a fight. His singular goal is staying prime minister, and it\u2019s not just about lust for power. Being prime minister may shield him from the judicial proceedings against him (though it\u2019s never been tested before); if he is a mere member of parliament or minister, he has no such hope. Netanyahu said he would be willing to unite with Gantz\u2019s Blue & White party on the condition that he remains prime minister, even if it\u2019s just a rotation. In exchange, Netanyahu would need to give Blue & White the keys to the kingdom: deciding foreign policy and the budget, and all the perks of office. But even that\u2019s a tough sell for Blue & White, whose members have spent the last nine months campaigning against him and holding him up as the exemplar of what\u2019s wrong with Israeli politics today. Lieberman will also work to undermine this particular outcome, as it would mean he could be cut out of government (Likud + Blue & White have enough seats between them to form a coalition on their own).\n\nThere is also a small chance that we don\u2019t end up with a unity government at all\u2014that Netanyahu is able to convince Yisrael Beitenu to join his right-religious coalition by offering many more concessions and jettisoning one of the more extreme religious parties to appease Lieberman. That\u2019s a very long shot at this point, but after more than a decade power, Bibi is a hard man to write off completely. In all likelihood though, last week\u2019s election results spell the end of the Netanyahu era of Israeli politics.\n\nThe One Thing to Read About It:\n\nAvigdor Lieberman, a former bar bouncer from Moldova, just became the most important politician in Israel\u2014his party\u2019s 8 seats in parliament will likely be critical in whatever coalition eventually manages to take power. But while the politics playing out in Israel the next few weeks will be fascinating, they pale in comparison to the up-again, down-again relationship between Netanyahu and Lieberman. Read this piece to understand why.\n\nThe One Major Misconception About It:\n\nThat Bibi\u2019s impact on Israeli politics is finished. Yes, he may be out of office and potentially on trial. But his legacy \u2013 everything from extremely hawkish views on Iran to expansion of settlements to a booming Israeli economy \u2013 will long outlast him, even with a Blue & White-led government.\n\nThe One Thing to Say About It at a Dinner Party:\n\nPolitics in Israel used to be about left vs. right, especially in regards to the Palestinian issue. Now politics has become about secular vs. religious. And the biggest loser of this paradigm shift is\u2026 the Palestinians. As always.\n\nThe One Thing to Avoid Saying About It:\n\nFirst Erdogan, then Bibi. If you\u2019re going to rerun elections, it helps not to live in an actual democracy.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu failed to secure victory in Israeli's election.
