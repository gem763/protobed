He discovered this accidentally, when trying to reprogram a rice cooker to talk.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an idle endeavour. Koo had decided he wanted to create a play in which he could interact on stage with AI-enhanced rice cookers. As metaphors for the contemporary South Korean experience go, rice works on a number of levels: it sustains life, it bonds together \u2013 and it\u2019s subjected to a great deal of outside heat and pressure.\n\nYet the mechanics of this also posed a considerable challenge. For one thing, Koo had to employ an especially gifted hacker to get his cooking utensil co-stars to do what he wanted. \u201cHe told me that the most difficult hacking material is home appliances. If there is a high-temperature heating system, then it\u2019s a real challenge,\u201d Koo tells Guardian Australia.\n\nThis, it turns out, is an understatement. \u201cDuring the try-out process, there were explosions of rice cookers,\u201d he says. \u201cOne took out the electricity of our entire studio building.\u201d\n\nNatives Go Wild review \u2013 First Nations circus is a potent mix of defiance and triumph Read more\n\nThe endeavour, though, was ultimately successful, and the talking rice cookers form part of Cuckoo, one of a trilogy of plays by Koo showing in Adelaide at OzAsia festival \u2013 a sprawling program of contemporary art which takes in everything from music to theatre. The offerings include a 20th anniversary performance of Nitin Sawhney\u2019s Beyond Skin, the Japanese troupe Miss Revolutionary Idol Berserker\u2019s utterly bonkers Totes Adorbs \u2764 Hurricane, and a play based on the recent economic history of South Korea as told by one man and three telerobotic rice cookers.\n\nCuckoo opens with Koo on a bare, black stage. In front of him are three high-end rice cookers: round, squat, nondescript, with wisps of steam rising up into the lights. He begins a monologue which starts with the International Monetary Fund approving a $55bn loan to South Korea and ends with a nation counting the human cost of their US-led rescue.\n\nI feel an urgency to share the work and participate in the civil revolution or activism Jaha Koo\n\nKoo\u2019s own visual montages and soundscape punctuate the monologue, as do the AI-enhanced machines. They interject, argue and even sing.\n\nThe elements might be quirky, but Cuckoo is about something quite serious: the political and economic story of Koo\u2019s home country and how international intervention affected people\u2019s lives, including those of Koo and the people around him.\n\n\u201cAround 1997, there was a severe economic crisis in east Asia including South Korea,\u201d Koo says. \u201cAt that time, I was a middle school student and I was easily able to hear family rumours at school. For example, someone\u2019s father was fired, someone\u2019s family business went bankrupt, someone\u2019s family lost their house or apartment, someone\u2019s parents got divorced.\u201d\n\nHe says when he decided to make Cuckoo, in 2014, South Koreans were not interested in interrogating what the financial crisis had meant. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t forget,\u201d Koo says. \u201cI lost many friends by suicide. The reasons were diverse, but they were within the same context \u2013 depression combined with economic problems and social pressure.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The AI-enhanced rice cookers interject, argue and even sing.

In some places it works almost as an idiosyncratic history lesson, but in others it\u2019s all too familiar. A run in Athens, Greece \u2013 another country ravaged by IMF-decreed austerity \u2013 was a cathartic experience for all involved.\n\n\u201cSome audience members came to my dressing room without permission because they wanted to talk about their stories. It was a very heavy and sad day. Their vision was also very dystopian, even apocalyptic,\u201d Koo says.\n\nTouring the show has given Koo some curly experiences in airports, travelling through international terminals as he does with bags containing five interestingly wired devices. \u201cSometimes they are caught by luggage checkers at the airport,\u201d he says. \u201cThen we have to explain who we are and what they are.\u201d\n\nAnother problem emerged with touring. Once they\u2019d worked out how to create the necessary AI for the show, they realised the cookers couldn\u2019t understand Koo\u2019s English. \u201cIt was not easy to make the program in Korean. But we have officially performed about 80 times internationally so far and there have only been computer errors for two of these.\u201d\n\nAnother \u2013 less emotional \u2013 variable in each performance is the rice itself. \u201cFor the performance, I need premium sushi rice. And sometimes they are not sticky enough, so we have to cook to check the quality of rice during rehearsal.\u201d\n\nAnchuli Felicia King: 'Don't be afraid of Asian characters with jagged edges' Read more\n\nKoo is currently making tweaks to The History of Korean Western Theatre, the third part of what he calls his Hamartia trilogy. Cuckoo will soon be shelved, along with the first in the series, 2015\u2019s Lolling and Rolling, to give him time to complete it. Nevertheless, he recognises the message of Cuckoo is especially potent in the current geopolitical context.\n\n\u201cIn macroscopic vision, [Cuckoo] can be discussed with the US policy and Trump\u2019s trade wars. At the same time, it can be discussed with my personal or your personal stories. It\u2019s not separated. They are tangled and mixed,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd he still has plans for it.\n\n\u201cNext year I will go to Hong Kong. I feel an urgency to share the work and participate in the civil revolution or activism.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Cuckoo by Jaha Koo is showing at Adelaide Festival Centre as part of OzAsia on 25 and 26 October.\n\n\u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.
