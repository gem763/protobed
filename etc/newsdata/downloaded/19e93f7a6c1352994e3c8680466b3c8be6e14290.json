We must bring this process to a conclusion.\u201d\n\nJohnson nonetheless said he remained \u201cconfident\u201d of completing the ratification process by October 31.\n\n\u2013 Tusk consults EU 27 \u2013\n\n\u201cI will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react,\u201d Tusk said on Twitter.\n\nAn EU source told AFP that the process \u201cmay take a few days\u201d and declined to comment on the non-signature.\n\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said the prime minister had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Tusk.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he had discussed the situation with Johnson and \u201cwished him success in the next stages\u201d in the Commons.\n\nBeing forced to send the letter after Saturday\u2019s defeat was a blow to Johnson, who has previously said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than prolong the tortuous process of ending Britain\u2019s 46-year-old membership of the EU.\n\nIn a letter to Conservative MPs afterwards, he warned that the other 27 EU states might reject parliament\u2019s request for a delay.\n\nBrussels urged Britain to explain its plan as soon as possible, while Macron\u2019s office said a new delay to Brexit was \u201cin nobody\u2019s interest\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Johnson beaten 322-306 \u2013\n\nSecuring the new divorce treaty at Thursday\u2019s EU summit had been a personal victory for the prime minister, a figurehead in the Leave campaign in Britain\u2019s 2016 EU membership referendum.\n\nHe had spent 48 hours frantically trying to persuade MPs to back it, and won support from many of the eurosceptic Conservatives who had three times rejected a previous divorce agreement secured by his predecessor Theresa May.\n\nBut parliament \u2014 like the frustrated public \u2014 is still bitterly divided over how and even whether Britain should end decades of integration with its closest trading partner.\n\nMPs voted by 322 to 306 to back a motion by former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin that \u201cwithholds approval (of the deal) unless and until implementing legislation is passed\u201d.\n\nThey were meeting on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War.\n\nWhile MPs voted inside parliament, outside, more than 100,000 people marched to demand a new referendum that could reverse Brexit.\n\nDemonstrators erupted into cheers at the news from inside the Commons.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really good, that\u2019s one step away from Brexit,\u201d demonstrator Philip Dobson told AFP.\n\n\u201cReject Brexit\u201d, \u201cPut It To The People\u201d and \u201cStop This Madness\u201d read some of the placards at the mass march, where many protesters also waved EU flags.\n\n\u2013 Legislation next week \u2013\n\nThe British government will introduce legislation next week to implement the divorce deal, with a first vote as soon as Tuesday.\n\nThe government also wants another vote on the deal on Monday, which may not be possible.\n\nThere is a chance the deal could pass, and Britain could still leave the EU on October 31, but there remains strong opposition to the agreement among MPs.\n\nMPs could try to hijack the legislation on the Brexit deal next week with a motion to call a new referendum, although previous attempts have failed.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reluctantly wrote to Brussels asking for a Brexit extension after MPs voted Saturday to force", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/cdaed8_britain-prime-minister-boris-johnson-brexit-delay-pointless-deeply-corrosive-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
