But, he explained in a moment rich with irony, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to snitch.\u201d\n\nInstead, Tekashi said, he opted for revenge.\n\n\u201cI wanted someone to shoot Harv, rob him,\u201d the rapper said in Manhattan federal court, where he is testifying as a prosecution witness against Ellison, 31, and another alleged gang member, Aljermiah \u201cNuke\u201d Mack, 33.\n\nIt was his third day on the stand, and he seemed agitated, huffing when asked to \u201cslowly\u201d repeat himself for the court reporter and squinting as prosecutors grilled him. He also name-dropped several famous rappers and alleged gang members, including Bronx natives Cardi B and Jim Jones.\n\nProsecutors charged Tekashi, 23, in a takedown of the Nine Trey Bloods gang last year\u2014and he and several other defendants cut plea deals.\n\nHis stint in the witness box has given jurors a glimpse into his life as a rap star who functioned as a cash cow for a street gang that gave him street credibility. He\u2019s also testified about the internal strife that gripped Nine Treys,\n\nOn Wednesday, Tekashi alleged that he was kidnapped by Ellison, described as his one-time \u201cenforcer,\u201d the night before he dropped his single \u201cFEFE\u201d last July. Dash-cam video played in court showed Tekashi pleading with Ellison to spare him and reminding him: \u201cI\u2019ve always done right by you.\u201d\n\nHe says Ellison and another assailant beat him up and then swiped more than $300,000 in jewelry\u2014including a diamond pony necklace with rainbow hair and a spinning \u201c69\u201d chain.\n\n\u201cI was so humiliated,\u201d Tekashi said, fiddling with Dutch braid pigtails. \u201cHumiliated because I constantly brag that I am untouchable and invincible on Instagram. Then I get kidnapped by a brother.\u201d\n\n\u201c I didn\u2019t want to snitch. \u201d \u2014 Tekashi69\n\nTekashi said he asked his former manager to take a photo of him in the hospital that showed him swollen and cut. It was immediately posted on Instagram, he said.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be the first one to tell the media that I was kidnapped and robbed,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to tell people what happened and not [Ellison].\u201d\n\nAfter the kidnapping, the Nine Treys were consumed by infighting, he testified. Egged on by his closest fellow gang members, the rapper said, he ordered a $50,000 hit on Ellison.\n\nThe goal was to either shoot or rob Ellison and \u201cmake him pay for what he did to me,\u201d he said. A few failed attempts were made, he said.\n\nHe admitted that embarrassment led him to lie to both police and his friends about the kidnapping; he falsely claimed he \u201cblacked out and was whipped with a pistol.\u201d\n\nBut he said he made sure not to tell authorities at the time who robbed him. \u201cI was still part of the Nine Trey gang and I had to stay loyal,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe rapper\u2019s symbiotic relationship with the Nine Treys disintegrated shortly after the July robbery when he denounced the Brooklyn-based crew on the radio, calling them \u201cfrauds\u201d and \u201cdirty Blood members.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, he and a dozen other alleged members were indicted on racketeering charges. The day after he was arrested, Tekashi said, he decided to cooperate with the feds to \u201cshed light on the whole operation.\u201d\n\nBronx rapper Jim Jones, who was described by Tekashi as a \u201cretired rapper,\u201d was heard in a wiretapped jailhouse call in court telling another Nine Trey member they \u201cbest get to violating\u201d Tekashi after he denounced the gang.\n\n\u201cHe not a gang member no more. He kicked out the whip. He was never a gang member,\u201d Jones said after Tekashi\u2019s radio interview. \u201cThey going to have to violate shorty because shorty is on some bullshit.\u201d\n\nThe defense, however, argued during cross examination the rapper is nothing more than a troll who enjoyed being famous for a few months.\n\nAlex Huot, Mack\u2019s attorney, showed Tekashi multiple interviews in which he admits to being \u201cjust a troll who knows how to rap\u201d and enjoyed the gangster prestige. While Tekashi admitted he \u201cliked getting under people\u2019s skin\u201d when he had a \u201cconflict,\u201d he pushed back against the argument that he was disingenuous.\n\n\u201cIt was me showing off a bit of my personality,\u201d he said as he slouched in his witness chair.\u201cI was just being me.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he joined the Bloods to \u201cadvance\u201d his music career and piggybacking off the Cardi B\u2019s formula of using the street gang in music videos, the rapper agreed.\n\n\u201cI knew who she was. I didn\u2019t pay attention,\u201d he said of the Bronx rapper, who has openly admitted about her past as a Bloods member.", "description": "The rapper says in court he was humiliated at being kidnapped and robbed and wanted revenge.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568918242/190919-melendez-tekshi-69-hero_fw2wyw", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
