That\u2019s because a large amount of bees appeared near home plate just prior to the 12:35 EST start of Monday\u2019s game, preventing both teams from taking the field.\n\nMonday\u2019s delay lasted 18 minutes as the bees ultimately departed the area and the game began at 12:53 p.m.\n\nThe bee delay was not the first in Cincinnati and it was not the first bee delay involving the San Francisco Giants, either. According to Major League Baseball, the two sides were delayed on April 17, 1976 at Riverfront Stadium due to the presence of bees.\n\nReds utility player Derek Dietrich was not in the starting lineup Monday, but he made his presence felt by dressing in a beekeeper suit and emerging on the field in an effort to scare the bees away. Fans in attendance thought Dietrich was actually there to help the situation, but Dietrich eventually began unbuttoning his shirt to reveal his jersey underneath the white suit.", "description": "The series finale between the Giants and Reds was delayed 18 minutes due to the presence of bees around home plate.", "authors": ["Kerry Crowley", "Kerry Crowley Is A Multimedia Beat Reporter Covering The San Francisco Giants.
