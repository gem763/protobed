He\u2019s also insisted that the UK would leave the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d on October 31.\n\nSteve Baker, chair of the hardline Brexit European Research Group (ERG), appeared to suggest on Twitter that he had been reassured that the government still intended to leave by the end of October, come what may.\n\n\n\nA source confirms all this means is that Government will obey the law.\n\n\n\nIt does not mean we will extend.\n\n\n\nIt does not mean we will stay in the EU beyond Oct 31.\n\n\n\nWe will leave. https://t.co/LuVt45rMAr \u2014 Steve Baker MP (@SteveBakerHW) October 4, 2019\n\nIt comes after Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans to solve the Irish backstop were given cold treatment by EU officials. Brussels\u2019 Brexit Steering Group (BSG) were less than impressed, writing in a draft statement on Thursday that the proposals \u201cdo not represent a basis for an agreement to which the parliament could give consent by the end of the month.\u201d\n\nThe UK government is yet to comment.\n\nLike this story?
