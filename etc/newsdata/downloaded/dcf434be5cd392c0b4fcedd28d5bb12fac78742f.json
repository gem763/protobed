He slammed Morey for sending the tweet while at the same time James said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cget into a feud with Daryl Morey.\u201d\n\nKing James sure has a funny way of trying to stay away from a feud with Morey. Did LeBron think that calling Morey \u201cmisinformed\u201d and \u201cnot educated\u201d about the protests going on in the streets of Hong Kong was a way of making friends and influencing Morey? He essentially said that Morey is ignorant and should have just waited a week to send his tweet because, you know, it affects his bottom line.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a \u2026 feud with Daryl Morey,\u201d James told reporters, \u201cbut I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually, so, just be careful what we tweet, what we say, what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, there can be a lot of negative that comes from that.\u201d\n\nSpiritually? Maybe for those who worship at the alter of the all-mighty dollar. Let\u2019s be honest, what LeBron means about the negative actions coming from Morey\u2019s tweet is all wrapped up in his ability to make money. His jersey is the most popular selling basketball jersey and he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat. The status quo in Hong Kong and China is serving him very well. There are 600 million NBA fans in China and that\u2019s a huge market.\n\nLeBron spoke on the NBA's China controversy (via @BenGolliver) pic.twitter.com/awITJSmBgk \u2014 Sports Illustrated (@SInow) October 15, 2019\n\nThis was LeBron\u2019s first public response to the protests in Hong Kong. While he was busy slamming Morey for a seven-word tweet which was quickly deleted, he was standing firm in his support of \u201cthe league\u201d. That \u2018s the same league that shut down a reporter last week when she asked a question during a press conference with James Harden and Russell Westbrook. The CNN reporter asked, \u201cAfter the events of this week and the fallout we\u2019ve seen, whether you both would feel differently about speaking out in that way in the future.\u201d A Houston Rockets spokesperson shut her down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge how the league handled the situation,\u201d James said. \u201cI think that, when you\u2019re misinformed or not educated about something, and I\u2019m just talking about the tweet itself, you never know the ramifications that can happen and we all see what that did. Not only did for our league, for all of us in America, for people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through things that you say that may cause harm to not only for yourself, but for the majority of people. I think that\u2019s just a prime example of that.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of ramifications, was LeBron James worried about ramifications after he called President Trump a bum? That happened over a disagreement about an invitation to the White House. Was he worried about the Trump supporters who might not buy his jerseys?\n\nU bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up! \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) September 23, 2017\n\nLebron James had no problem standing in support with Colin Kaepernick taking a knee in protest during NFL games. Yet when Morey stood with the Hong Kong protesters \u2013 who carry American flags as they protest \u2013 suddenly James wants Americans to kowtow to the brutal Communist dictatorship.\n\nMorey is an educated man. He graduated from the M.I.T. Sloan M.B.A. program and is one of the winningest general managers in the NBA. While Adam Silver, NBA commissioner, publicly supported Morey\u2019s right to excercise free speech, the league went silent.\n\nWhen James began to receive criticism over his remarks, he doubled down and tried to explain.\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nWhile LeBron was in China with the Lakers, some American politicians were in Hong Kong. Senator Josh Hawley tweeted his response. He points out that people are being harmed \u2013 the protesters in the streets.\n\nHaving just been in Hong Kong \u2013 on the streets & with the protestors \u2013 this kind of garbage is hard to take. LeBron, are YOU educated on \u201cthe situation\u201d? Why don\u2019t you go to Hong Kong? Why don\u2019t you meet the people there risking their lives for their most basic liberties https://t.co/KvphH9RiAl \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 15, 2019\n\nThis statement is unbelievable. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed\u201d? By Daryl Morey daring to express sympathy for democracy? News flash: people ARE being harmed \u2013 shot, beaten, gassed \u2013 right now in Hong Kong. By China. By the Communist Party the NBA is so eager to appease \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 15, 2019\n\nJames is a Nike sponsored athlete. Nike prides itself in delivering woke social justice messages in advertising. It\u2019s not like LeBron James doesn\u2019t speak out in political ways. For him to now tell others to just shut up because it will affect his earning capacity is beyond the pale. He would have been better off just remaining silent himself.", "description": "\"Could have waited a week to send it\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/c184c5a7-a02a-4451-b652-ae71759a21ff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
