The world first, as it is being described, is the result of a battle between fund manager 3iQ and the Ontario Securities Commission.\n\nThe imaginatively-titled \u201cThe Bitcoin Fund\u201d should be available to Canadian retail investors later this year. It is expected to be listed for trading on a major Canadian stock exchange.\n\n\u201cHistory in the Making\u201d: Tyler Winklevoss Celebrates The Bitcoin Fund\n\nAccording to a press release from 3iQ, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) approved the new fund earlier today. Having been rejected by the regulator in February, the company launched an appeal. It claimed that it would be following current regulatory guidelines for custody, pricing of the asset (BTC) itself, and the auditing process.\n\nIn a landmark victory for Canadian fintech and capital markets, 3iQ has been given the green light by the Ontario Securities Commission to file a prospectus and apply to list \u201cThe Bitcoin Fund\u201d on a Canadian stock exchange.https://t.co/vMXmeEsig6 \u2014 3iQ Corp (@3iq_corp) October 30, 2019\n\nAs part of today\u2019s hearing on the matter, OSC Commissioner Lawrence P. Haber stated that the regulatory body had not sufficiently proved that such a fund built around Bitcoin could not be compliant with existing regulations. He also refuted the notion that retail investors were not sophisticated enough to perceive the possible risks of investing in digital currencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nChairman of 3iQ, Howard Atkinson, commented on the victory, described by the firm\u2019s social media department as \u201clandmark\u201d:\n\n\u201cWe look forward to offering retail investors exposure to this exciting new asset class within registered and traditional investment accounts.\u201d\n\nHistory in the making. Proud that @Gemini Custody\u2122 will be the custodian for @3iq_corp's \"The Bitcoin Fund\" that will list on the Canadian stock exchange! #ToTheMoon \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude80 https://t.co/DfTGscVa00 \u2014 Tyler Winklevoss (@tylerwinklevoss) October 30, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Tyler Winklevoss, the co-founder of the Gemini crypto asset trading venue, called the ruling \u201chistory in the making\u201d, adding he was proud that 3iQ would be using his firm\u2019s Bitcoin custody solution to protect users\u2019 investments.\n\nTyler\u2019s twin brother, Cameron, added:\n\n\u201c3iQ has carefully selected a team of professional partners with expertise in the digital asset industry to construct a safe and secure fund product for the Canadian market, and we are excited to be selected as their custodian.\u201d\n\nThese partners not only include Gemini but also VanEck, one of the firms behind repeated efforts to bring the first Bitcoin ETF to the US market.\n\nFred Pye, President & CEO of 3iQ, also provided comment about the ongoing work the firm has undertaken with the OSC:\n\n\u201cOver the past three years, we have worked actively with the OSC\u2019s Investment Funds and Structured Products Branch to create an investment fund that we hope will allow retail investors the benefits of investing in bitcoin through a regulated, listed fund.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen if The Bitcoin Fund will prove popular amongst investors. However, the ruling is a pretty big step towards greater regulatory acceptance of the asset class, with most regulated Bitcoin platforms around the world being reserved for accredited investors only.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Trades at Large Premium in Argentina as Dollar Purchase Restrictions Set In\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Retail investors in Canada will soon be able to get exposure to Bitcoin through a fully-regulated, closed-end fund.
