You meet someone online and you instantly click. You text them non-stop. From sharing snaps of what you are eating to talking about your childhood dreams, the conversation doesn't seem to end.\n\nAnd, naturally, one of you asks the other out and both of you are on cloud nine. Soon you find yourself, sitting in a restaurant, staring at this person in utter silence.\n\nWhy can't you both have a conversation sitting opposite each other the same way you were on text? Well, welcome to modern dating 101.\n\nPexels\n\nWhen this happened to me, I dismissed it as a one-time thing. But it happened to so many of my friends where they meet people and are super compatible on text but have no chemistry in real life. And do you know why this happens?\n\nWell, let's try to put it as nicely as possible: texting has made dating and the ability to hold conversations in real life turbulent than ever before.\n\nWe are constantly on our smartphones. We literally don't use anything as much as that damn thing. And since smartphones are such an inseparable part of our lives, we spend a lot of time texting. Because who picks up the phone to talk when you can say whatever you want to in a few words, right?\n\nPexels\n\nThe deal with texting is that it allows us to present a more polished version of ourselves. For instance, the person you are hitting it off with, loves say, French movies and you don't know shit about French movies. So you Google that stuff and somehow manage to appear more knowledgeable in front of your crush.\n\nIn real life, when they talk about say an upcoming French movie director, you are clueless. And this leads to complete silence.\n\nPlus, we can't ignore that meeting in real time isn't easy. We are more self- conscious since we have built up such a reputation, we want to live up to it, now don't we?\n\nPexels\n\nSo what should you do in order to build chemistry in real life?\n\nWell, the times we live in have dictated that on the first few dates stop looking for chemistry. Let the dates and time you spend with the person you are crushing on be driven by curiosity.\n\nTake things slow. Get to know each other. Find out their interests. What matters to them and what doesn't. And when you have all the information and you like what you know, then start to build chemistry.\n\nAlso, please know, that if you meet someone you instantly connected with on text but in real life you think it's not going anywhere, move on. Trust your gut. And don't regret putting yourself out there because finding love isn't easy. So use your smartphone wisely, kids.", "description": "Why can't you both have a conversation sitting opposite each other the same way you were on text?
