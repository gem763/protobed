(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter hosting a rally in North Carolina with Vice President Pence earlier this week and then blasting out endorsements for two GOP candidates running in special elections there, President Trump closely tracked the returns on Tuesday night. When it became clear that both men vying for open House seats had won, the president took to Twitter in triumph.\n\nIn a flurry of tweets sent well into early Wednesday morning, Trump celebrated the \u201cTWO BIG VICTORIES\u201d and boasted about his influence on the results \u2014 while also taking time to bash the \u201cFake News\u201d and share a photo suggesting a third term for himself.\n\n\u201cBIG NIGHT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,\u201d he tweeted in all-caps. \u201cCONGRATULATIONS TO ALL!\u201d\n\n[Republican Bishop pulls out narrow win in N.C. House race]\n\nThe wins came as Trump has faced downturns in national polling and amid new White House turmoil as he ousted national security adviser John Bolton. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday found that 56 percent of voting-age Americans say they disapprove of Trump\u2019s performance in office, and his approval rating among that demographic stands at 38 percent.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results gave Trump a chance to celebrate instead. As the votes poured in, Trump\u2019s tweets rolled out, the first post appearing around 8:50 p.m.\n\n\u201cOne down, one to go,\u201d Trump tweeted, referencing Republican Greg Murphy\u2019s race in North Carolina\u2019s heavily conservative 3rd Congressional District. Murphy eventually beat Democrat Allen Thomas by 24 points.\n\nOne down, one to go \u2013 Greg Murphy is projected to win in the Great State of North Carolina! #NC03 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nThe president then turned his attention to Republican Dan Bishop, who had been locked in a close race against Democratic challenger Dan McCready in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District. Citing an unnamed poll that had Bishop \u201cdown 17 points 3 weeks ago,\u201d Trump took credit for turning the candidate\u2019s campaign around. It is unclear what poll Trump was citing. An Inside Elections poll published Aug. 30 had McCready up by four points, still within the margin of error.\n\n\u201cHe then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race,\u201d Trump tweeted about Bishop. \u201cBig Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201c@CNN & @MSNBC are moving their big studio equipment and talent out. Stay tuned!\u201d\n\nDan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race. Big Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win. @CNN & @MSNBC are moving their big studio equipment and talent out. Stay tuned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nIn the lead-up to the special election, Trump was a major presence in the 9th district race as he and Republicans threw their weight behind Bishop. Beyond repeatedly urging his 64 million Twitter followers to vote for Bishop, Trump and Pence traveled to the district on Monday, boosting support for the candidate at a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d rally in Fayetteville, N.C. Footage of the president praising Bishop and slamming McCready was also used in a closing TV ad.\n\nBy around 11:20 p.m. on Tuesday, Bishop had officially eked out a victory over McCready by more than two percentage points in a race that has been described as \u201ca bellwether for the president\u2019s political fortunes in 2020.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Trump was jubilant, alternating between congratulating Bishop and Murphy and criticizing media outlets for their coverage.\n\n\u201c@CNN & @MSNBC were all set to have a BIG victory, until Dan Bishop won North Carolina 09,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cNow you will hear them barely talk about, or cover, the race. Fake News never wins!\u201d\n\nFollowing the election, other conservatives also credited the president with propelling Bishop over the finish line. \u201cTrump pushed him over the top, absolutely,\u201d Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), who represents the 8th District, told The Post. \u201cTurnout is everything when you have a close race.\u201d\n\nAfter retweeting House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) thanking him \u201cfor once again leading us to victory,\u201d Trump shared a photo of a \u201cTrump 2024\u201d campaign sign \u2014 marking the second time in two days he has suggested pursuing a third term. At Monday\u2019s rally, Trump joked that he would stay in office through 2026, so he could be president when the United States co-hosts the World Cup, The Post reported.\n\nTrump also apparently stayed up to watch coverage of the elections after they were called. Though he had chastised CNN earlier in the night, Trump had kind words for one of the network\u2019s political commentators, Alice Stewart, who joined host Don Lemon to discuss North Carolina.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be great on a network with much higher ratings,\u201d he tweeted around 12:30 a.m. \u201cKeep up the good work!\u201d\n\nAlice @alicetweet Stewart: Thank you for the nice words while on @CNN concerning the TWO big Republican Congressional victories. You\u2019d be great on a network with much higher ratings. Keep up the good work! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nBut his praise ended there. In another tweet shared shortly after 1 a.m., Trump accused the media of \u201cbarely\u201d reporting on Murphy\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cThe win was far bigger than anticipated \u2014 there was just nothing the Fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo we had TWO BIG VICTORIES tonight, Greg & Dan!\u201d", "description": "In a flurry of tweets sent well into early Wednesday morning, Trump celebrated the \u201cTWO BIG VICTORIES\u201d \u2014 while also taking time to bash the \u201cFake News.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team", "September At Am", "Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
