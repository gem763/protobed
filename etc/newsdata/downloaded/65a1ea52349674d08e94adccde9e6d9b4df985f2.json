One way of interpreting these motivators is that they are cultural factors which influence behavior.\n\nThe influence of cultural factors on economic performance has attracted the attention of economists for a while. A part of an essay written over 15 years ago by economist Kaushik Basu, \u2018The Indian Economy:Up to 1991 and Since\u2019, explores the influence of cultural factors.\n\nThe relevant parts of the essay can be boiled down to the following points:\n\n# Economic performances may owe a lot to the cultural underpinnings of the economy in question.\n\n# India\u2019s prolonged economic stagnation cannot be properly understood if one ignores variables such as social norms, culture, beliefs and fabric of social interaction.\n\n# An understanding of the role of culture and collective beliefs can help in design of better policy.\n\n# Culture and social norms are not static; they evolve.\n\nTherefore, the essence of the argument put forth by Banerjee and Duflo is not new. But it does help focus on the often forgotten aspects which influence human behavior.\n\nIn an Indian context, can open defecation ever end without an understanding of the influence of caste on human behavior?", "description": "Economists Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo in an essay written recently in The New York Times questioned the efficacy of financial incentives on human behavior.
