I wanted to buy a towel or pillow but they said they don't have them either,\u201d said 43-year-old Kumiko Ikegaya. \u201cI am happy that they advanced to the last eight, but honestly I wish they had more goods here.\"\n\nFans are coming to the megastore from far and wide just to pick up some memorabilia. Yoko Inoue arrived from Morioka, 500km to the north of Tokyo.\n\n\u201cI really didn't know about the game of rugby, but it has become a sport which has ignited the whole nation,\u201d said Inoue. \u201cI really wanted to come here when my daughter told me that there is a merchandise store.\"\n\nJapan will face South Africa in Tokyo on Sunday.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "With Japan reaching the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals for the first time fans are scrambling to get their hands on official merchandise but such is the popularity of Brave Blossoms jerseys that demand far outstrips supply.
