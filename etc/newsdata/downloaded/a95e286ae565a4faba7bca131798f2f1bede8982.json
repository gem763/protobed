On the contrary, they promoted it.\u201d\n\nSix people died in the Lakanal House fire in 2009.\n\nGrenfell United said senior firefighters had failed to learn the lessons from the blaze and called on them to \u201cstop hiding behind the bravery of their frontline firefighters\u201d.\n\nThe group said: \u201cWhile nothing can ever bring back our loved ones that passed away in the fire, this is a strong report with a forensic examination of the events of the night and clear recommendations that if implemented will save lives. The Government cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of Lakanal and ignore them.\n\n\u201cJustice means different things for all of us but the truth needs to be at the heart of our collective healing. We have been waiting a long time for this report.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s findings give us some confidence that our journey towards truth has finally begun. We now need to urgently see responsibility and action from this report, not excuses.\u201d\n\nIn his report, Sir Martin said the principal reason the flames shot up the building so fiercely was the combustible aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a \u201csource of fuel\u201d.\n\nThe report also concluded that the fire, in which 72 people died, started as the result of an \u201celectrical fault in a large fridge-freezer\u201d in a fourth-floor flat.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nThe judge said he had not intended to investigate whether the building complied with regulations at this stage, but there was already \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that the external walls did not.\n\nGrenfell United said it was Sir Martin\u2019s \u201cmost important conclusion\u201d and raises serious questions for those involved in the refurbishment of the block.\n\nThey said: \u201cThis finding adds to our determination to see criminal charges brought against those responsible for turning our homes into a \u2018death trap\u2019.\u201d\n\nSir Martin also criticised the London Fire Brigade for its \u201cstay-put\u201d strategy when residents were told to remain in their flats by firefighters and 999 operators for nearly two hours after the blaze broke out just before 1am.\n\nThe strategy was rescinded at 2.47am.\n\nSir Martin said: \u201cThat decision could and should have been made between 1.30am and 1.50am and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities.\u201d", "description": "Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the absence of a plan to evacuate the tower was a `major omission\u00b4.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/wire-20368218-1572429859-180_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
