I think 'Cheik' has done a really good job,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm proud of the job he does. He's a good old mate of mine.\"\n\nJones referenced the pair's long association with Randwick club icon Jeff Sayle, who died last month aged 77.\n\nSayle was an influential figure in the career of both coaches and they paid emotional public tributes soon after learning of his death.\n\n\"There will be a bloke in the sky who will be quite excited about Michael and I coaching against each other this week,\" Jones said on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm sure he's having a few beers next to St Peter now looking at the situation.\"\n\nJones also took the chance to play down the invitation to Canberra Raiders NRL coach Ricky Stuart who has joined the England camp as part of their preparations this week.\n\nCheika said he found it \"weird\" that Stuart should be involved, sparking a possible flashpoint.\n\nJones said the timing of the invitation to \"old mate\" Stuart in the week they're playing Australia was a coincidence.\n\n\"It's just an exchange of ideas,\" Jones said.\n\n\"If you look at the history of what we've done over these four years we've invited coaches in all the time because we want to share their knowledge, we want to make sure we keep learning.\"\n\nHowever, a mischievous Jones then revealed he had been up until 9pm on Tuesday night \"picking Ricky's brain\".", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones has offered an unexpected olive branch to Wallabies counterpart Michael Cheika, believing the death of a man who mentored them both...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
