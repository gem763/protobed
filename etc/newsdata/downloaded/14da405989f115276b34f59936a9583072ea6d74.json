He said, \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Bitcoin what I see as digital gold and totally different Libra.\"\n\nBitcoin v.s. non-volatile and scalable cryptocurrency\n\nWhile treating Bitcoin as digital gold, Marcus stressed that the Libra project is seeking to create a non-volatile and scalable cryptocurrency rather than provide services for a high-volatile asset such as Bitcoin. He explained:\n\n\u201cIf there was a stable, low-volatility, scalable version of Bitcoin that we could use today, my life would be so much simpler. We could just focus on embedding that in the Calibra wallet.\u201d\n\nStability of fiat currencies backing Libra\n\nIn the interview, the CNBC host, who is known for his Bitcoin maximalism, asked about Libra\u2019s backing which will supposedly consists of a basket of major fiat currencies such as the United States dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound and Singapore dollar.\n\nSpecifically, Kernen stated that Libra\u2019s planned peg to fiat currencies may not be a good idea, as such currencies are vulnerable to devaluation.\n\nMarcus\u2019 statements follow those of U.S. Representative Warren Davidson, who said that Facebook using Calibra would be a \u201cway better idea\u201d than creating a new asset.", "description": "Calibra head David Marcus says he is a big fan of Bitcoin, but it is totally different than Libra", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNWZhODZlNDk3MDcyYjUyMGJjMzA0NTRhZTkzNzg4OTAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
