It\u2019s interesting \u2014 it\u2019s not something you see every day,\u201d said Eyad Tamish, 39.\n\nThe resident of the city \u2014 known in Hebrew as Akko and Arabic as Akka \u2014 came to \u201cadmire the show\u201d with his young son Ibrahim, perched on his shoulders, and his wife Hana.\n\nSome 60 Israeli and foreign troupes \u2014 from Italy, China, India and the United States \u2014 presented their creations over four days on stage and in the alleys of the ancient city.\n\nArchaeological sites such as the Hospitaller Fortress dating back to the Crusader times served as an atypical setting for colourful performances.\n\nBorn in Tel Aviv in 1937, Kotler is an actor and director.\n\nIn 1967, he won best actor at the Cannes Film Festival for his role in the film \u201cThree Days and a Child\u201d by director Uri Zohar.\n\nA pillar of the Israeli arts scene, he directed the Haifa Theatre from 1970 to 1978 and the prestigious Israel Festival from 1985 to 1990.\n\nHe often evokes in his work the country\u2019s political situation, including the conflict with the Palestinians.\n\nSuch reflections have made him at times a target of critics on the right who see him as a condescending left-wing artist.\n\nIn 2015, he came under fire after seeming to compare those who vote for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party to a \u201cherd of cattle chewing straw and munching on cud.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Country being stupid\u2019 \u2013\n\nAlthough he founded the festival, Kotler was presenting his own piece for the first time this year because \u201che has things to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Curse\u201d is based on three ancient Greek tragedies: Aeschylus\u2019s \u201cAgamemnon\u201d, Sophocles\u2019s \u201cElectra\u201d and Euripides\u2019s \u201cIphigenia in Aulis.\u201d\n\nWhile focusing on ancient Greece, it has relevance for today, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the story of a country that is doing something stupid, in this case embarking on the Trojan War, because it is what the king has decided, considering that the country belongs to him,\u201d said Kotler.", "description": "Oded Kotler made his way discretely through the crowd taking in the acrobats and clowns performing at a festival in Acre.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Oded-Kotler-theatre-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
