McMaster Out as National Security Adviser as Trump\u2019s Purge Continues", "language": "en", "text": "National Security Adviser Herbert Raymond McMaster is the newest member of Washington\u2019s fastest-growing social club: former Trump White House officials.\n\nMcMaster, a Lieutenant General in the United States Army and a veteran of three wars, is the latest in a recent string of casualties in an administration that has seen the departure of numerous senior officials\u2014a purge that comes a mere five months after Trump mused that his cabinet amounted to \u201cone of the finest group of people ever assembled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor,\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday. \u201cI am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.\u201d\n\nShortly after the president announced that he would be replaced by former U.N. ambassador and noted hyper-interventionist John Bolton, McMaster announced that he plans to retire from the U.S. Army this summer.\n\n\u201cAfter thirty-four years of service to our nation, I am requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer after which I will leave public service,\u201d McMaster said in a statement, noting that he was \u201cthankful\u201d Trump for his time as national security adviser.\n\nMcMaster is the president\u2019s second national security adviser\u2014the first, Michael Flynn, resigned after a mere 24 days following revelations regarding undisclosed contact he had made with Russian government officials and has since pleaded guilty to perjury. His exit follows months of tensions between McMaster and the president. McMaster had been a vocal advocate on behalf of the Iran nuclear deal, a lonely position to take in the Trump administration.\n\nMcMaster had been rumored to be on the outs with President Trump for months, most recently due to public comments calling evidence of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election \u201cincontrovertible.\u201d The remarks prompted a swift reaction from the Trump on Twitter:\n\nBut a primary obstacle to McMaster\u2019s continued employment was reportedly his staunch defense of the Iranian nuclear deal, which directly conflicted with Trump\u2019s promises, extending back to the presidential campaign, to kill the agreement. Rex Tillerson, who Trump fired via Twitter on March 13, was another proponent of staying in the deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for imposing limitations on the nation\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\nTrump had campaigned against the Iran deal, telling pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC that his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d as president would be \u201cto dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran,\u201d but as national security adviser, McMaster met with top senators on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January to help protect the agreement.\n\nMcMaster\u2019s public disagreements with the president and his staff on the Iran deal and Russia might have been anticipated, had President Trump read McMaster\u2019s Ph.D. dissertation. Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, The Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies that Led to Vietnam, which was eventually published as a popular book, criticized the Joint Chiefs of Staff for deferring to President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s wishes regarding U.S. strategy in Vietnam rather than provide counsel that conflicted with the president\u2019s ego.\n\n\u201cThrough their own actions,\u201d McMaster wrote in the book, \u201cthe Chiefs\u2026 always found themselves in the difficult position of questioning a policy that the president had already approved.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s second national security adviser, a long-standing proponent of the Iran nuclear deal, is the latest to be purged from the White House ranks.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1521758651/180322-mcmaster-out-hero_rz9yks", "published_at": "2018-03-22"}
