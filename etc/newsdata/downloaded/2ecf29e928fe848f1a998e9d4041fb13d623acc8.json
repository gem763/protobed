Refuse Fascism advocates for the removal of the Trump administration, including Vice President Pence and the president\u2019s Cabinet, and launched a pro-impeachment campaign called \u201cOut Now\u201d on Saturday.\n\nThe group said dozens of activists gathered on the beach in the early afternoon holding multicolored fabric to spell out \u201cTrump-Pence #OutNow!\u201d Then, the group marched along the boardwalk and onto the Santa Monica Pier to hold a rally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA small group of Trump supporters followed the leftist protesters to the pier. The groups exchanged insults for about 10 minutes, police told the Los Angeles Times, before shoving one another and screaming obscenities.\n\n\u201cEverything went to crap,\u201d Santa Monica Police Sgt. D. Hicks, who did not give his full name, told the newspaper.\n\nThat\u2019s when Dempsey pulled out the bear spray, video shows.\n\n\u201cAt least 10 other people got directly pepper sprayed in the face,\u201d a writer for the Revolutionary Communist Party wrote in a post recounting the incident.\n\nTwo other pro-Trump supporters grabbed one man from the crowd and held him on the ground, against the sandy wooden planks of the pier. Video shows Dempsey run up to the man and expel bear repellent into his face as the other men held him down. Then, Dempsey and another Trump supporter quickly walk away.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice cornered Dempsey shortly after the incident, detaining him in an alcove in front of the police substation on the pier, just steps from where the attack unfolded.\n\nDempsey and another protester, who told police he was Dempsey\u2019s brother, said they had been attacked by the Refuse Fascism crowd. Protesters denied that story to the cops, offering to show them video of Dempsey spraying people after running up to the group from a few feet away.\n\n\u201cWhy am I being penned up when you\u2019ve got all these people who attacked us?\u201d Dempsey said to a police officer who questioned while onlookers recorded the conversation. When an officer moved to place Dempsey in handcuffs, he complained, \u201cWhy do you have to put me in handcuffs?\u201d and again blamed the attack on \u201ccommies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn its post recounting the incident, the Revolutionary Community Party said several people were hurt as people scrambled out of the way of the fiery spray and one protester may have broken her arm in the chaos. Police said no protesters suffered severe injuries, although some were treated for exposure to the bear spray.\n\nAD\n\nA Facebook account that appears to belong to Dempsey regularly insults liberals and celebrates Trump. Some posts spread conspiracy theories about mass shootings and two posts from August criticized Trump for statements he made supporting \u201cred flag\u201d laws after 22 people were shot and killed at an El Paso Walmart.\n\nAD\n\nSaturday\u2019s bear spray attack showed the continued danger of extremist political violence, advocates say.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSaturday\u2019s desperate violence by remnants of Trump\u2019s tattered alt-right coalition is another example of why city leaders and law enforcement need to continue take these attacks on community safety seriously,\u201d Eric Ward, executive director of the Western States Center, a nonprofit that works to counter far-right extremism, said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201cThese individuals must be held responsible for intentionally sowing chaos and violence in communities.\u201d\n\nDempsey has a \u201cfairly extensive\u201d criminal record, police told the Times. KTLA reported that the Southern California man had been previously convicted of burglary twice, as well as larceny and conspiracy. Police said he was on parole on Saturday and would have been prohibited from possessing bear repellent or similar chemical weapons because of his status as a felon.\n\nPolice told the Associated Press a second man may have also attacked the anti-Trump crowd with pepper spray on Saturday. Investigators said they are still analyzing video of the clash to identify the other suspect.\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Office records show Dempsey is being held in jail without bond. His arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAD", "description": "Santa Monica police arrested David Nicholas Dempsey shortly after he was captured on video spraying anti-Trump protesters with bear repellent.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0XmV0B7jXLCkjgteOuCOvVamuKA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EHQQWUDTQVEDLERRIR3GET5T4E.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
