The Redskins want the cutting-edge offensive schemes, but the guy calling the plays this season will still be Jay Gruden, whose seat has never been hotter in his sixth year as the head coach.\n\nFifteen teams have new play-callers, according to sports website The Ringer, since the start of last season, but the Redskins \u2014 despite finishing 29th in offensive efficiency in 2018 \u2014 aren\u2019t among them.\n\nSitting on a couch inside the Redskins\u2019 facility, Gruden said no when asked if he seriously considered relinquishing play-calling duties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I like to do. So\u2026 what the (heck)?\u201d he laughed.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been unheard of. After all, before McVay became the genius behind the Rams\u2019 video-game offense, he was Gruden\u2019s and the Redskins\u2019 offensive coordinator \u2014 including calling the plays until he left in 2017.\n\n\u201cPeople think I\u2019m calling everything,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI\u2019m really not. \u2026 It\u2019s a group effort. That\u2019s what I intend on continuing to do.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins begin their season Sunday in Philadelphia with more question marks around the offense than just Gruden\u2019s play-calling. The wide receivers are regarded as one of the least-talented units in the league. The offensive line, missing a seven-time Pro Bowler at left tackle, has plugged in a former first-round bust at left guard. Oh, and there\u2019s another new quarterback set to start \u2014 Washington\u2019s fifth since last year.\n\nWith a defense that has the potential to be one of the league\u2019s best, can Washington score enough points to win games?\n\nIf they want to keep up, the Redskins will have to rediscover the success that they had in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 the last time Washington had back-to-back winning seasons \u2014 when they ranked 12th and fifth in offensive efficiency. It starts with Gruden.\n\nFinding balance\n\nThe Redskins surprised last year when they emerged as a run-heavy, grind-it-out offense with Alex Smith at quarterback and Adrian Peterson in the backfield. The offense hardly seemed to fit the perception of Gruden as a pass-happy play-caller.\n\nBut Gruden dismisses that reputation. Relying on the run and being physical in the trenches, he says, are two principles he insists upon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my type of game,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI like winning 20-17, 17-10, really.\u201d\n\nLast season\u2019s retro approach had its drawbacks. The Redskins ranked near the bottom of practically every category, from basic stats to advanced. They ranked just 28th in yards, 29th in points per game (17.6) and 29th in passing efficiency. Just 31.8% of their drives ended in an offensive score, eighth-worst in the NFL.\n\nThis year, Gruden wants balance \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t mean having a 50-50 split between the run and the pass, he says. As run-heavy as the Redskins got at times in 2018, they still only rushed 42.8% of the time (11th league-wide). In the modern NFL, teams rarely have a true 50-50 split as offenses skew more toward passing. Only one team \u2014 the Seattle Seahawks \u2014 ran more running plays than passing.\n\nBalance for Gruden means being able to open up the playbook to dial up a variety of plays.\n\nThe Redskins were inefficient last year in part because the offense was constantly in negative situations.\n\nFor instance, Washington led the league in offensive penalties with 4.19 per game. Of their 67 penalties, 32 were the result of holding, and false starts (27) trailed narrowly behind. Digging out of self-inflicted setbacks made it harder to sustain drives.\n\nThe Redskins faced third-and-10-or-longer 69 times last year, tied for third-most in the NFL. On second down, they faced having to convert at least 10 yards on 138 plays, 12th-highest league-wide. Gruden said the Redskins have to do better. Avoiding penalties and negative plays on early downs is key to improving those stats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a chess match,\u201d running back Chris Thompson said. \u201cThe coach on one end is guessing and offensive play-caller is guessing and Jay, I feel like he\u2019s making the right calls in those situations way more times than not.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really just an execution thing on our end.\u201d\n\nAn unproven group\n\nPaul Richardson heard the same things in Seattle. When the 27-year-old was with the Seahawks for the first four years of his career, Richardson and his fellow receivers faced the same doubts, same criticisms the Redskins do now.\n\n\u201cThey called us pedestrian,\u201d Richardson said.\n\nRichardson isn\u2019t fazed by the skepticism. The unit may have been one of the least productive in the NFL last year, but, as Richardson notes, Washington played with four quarterbacks. That made it tough for any wideout to produce. \u201cI expect to put points on the board, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got enough talent to.\u201d\n\nStill, there are reasons the position group is lightly regarded. Other than Richardson, the other members of the Redskins\u2019 receiving corps have played a combined four games in the NFL. That\u2019s it.\n\nThere are also questions as to whether the team\u2019s best players can stay healthy. Thompson and Richardson each missed six and nine games in 2018, respectively. Tight end Jordan Reed suffered a concussion in the preseason and has yet to play a full season in his career. Derrius Guice is coming off a torn ACL.\n\nIf the Redskins lack talent, this might be a situation in which Gruden and his coaching staff will have to get creative in order to exploit opposing defenses.\n\n\u201cTo find good units, whether offense or defense in the NFL, you gotta have a coach who brings you a really good scheme,\u201d ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky said. \u201cI do think their scheme is a good scheme. And then you\u2019ve got to have the players. And then you\u2019ve got to have the coach who knows how to call that scheme.\n\n\u201cDo they have the players? The answer would be no.\u201d\n\nGruden acknowledged the Redskins have an \u201cunproven group,\u201d but expressed confidence in them.\n\n\u201cI think we can be diverse in what we can do,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve obviously got to be able to run it, stay balanced. If we can be balanced and not be one dimensional on third down and longs and be behind, then we\u2019ll have a chance to be pretty good. \u201c\n\nThe Haskins factor\n\nGruden created a mini-stir this offseason when he joked that if the Redskins miss the playoffs in 2019, he\u2019ll be fired. It\u2019s a fair assumption, given Washington has missed the postseason three straight years.\n\nYet, just as important this season for the Redskins is first-rounder Dwayne Haskins\u2019 development.\n\nIf the Redskins don\u2019t make the playoffs, could Gruden retain his job if Haskins thrives? First, the Ohio State product will need to see the field. Haskins lost the starting job to Case Keenum, though hardly anyone expects the veteran to keep the role for the entire year.\n\nIn today\u2019s NFL, the relationship between the quarterback and coach is more emphasized than ever. Teams aren\u2019t just hiring the McVays of the world because they\u2019re young and charismatic \u2014 they\u2019re doing so with the expectation that the hires will elevate their signal-callers.\n\nMcVay transformed Jared Goff\u2019s career. Likewise, Indianapolis\u2019 Frank Reich and Chicago\u2019s Matt Nagy both made the playoffs as first-year coaches and helped their quarterbacks\u2019 development in 2018. This offseason, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Green Bay, Arizona, Tampa Bay and the Jets all made offensive-minded hires to pair with their quarterbacks. Three of them are first-time head coaches.\n\nThe idea, however, isn\u2019t revolutionary. Gruden was hired to save Robert Griffin III\u2019s career when he was hired by the Redskins in 2014.\n\nGruden has a mixed track record when it comes to working with quarterbacks. He elevated Andy Dalton in Cincinnati, but didn\u2019t get results with Griffin. Kirk Cousins flourished into a full-time starter, but Alex Smith was inconsistent.\n\nGruden\u2019s scheme, a variation of the West Coast offense, allows for quarterbacks to get into rhythm with quick throws. Orlovsky, too, said the Redskns do a good job of mixing up their formations and splitting out their wide receivers.\n\nBut every quarterback is different, Gruden said.\n\n\u201cYou have to handle them as so,\u201d the coach said. \u201cYou have to try and implement a system that fits their style. And certain guys might have more zone reads or bootlegs and other guys might have more pure dropbacks. Dwayne is more of a pocket pure presence of a guy. Case may be able to get outside the pocket a little bit more and do some different things.\n\n\u201cYou try to cater to the skill that you have and do the best you can to put the pieces around them where they can succeed.\u201d\n\nHis job might depend on it this season.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
