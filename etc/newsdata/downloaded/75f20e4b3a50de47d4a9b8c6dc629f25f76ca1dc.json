If passed, doctors will face criminal charges for performing abortions after a foetal heartbeat is detected.\n\nHeartbeats are typically heard after the sixth week of pregnancy, before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. The effect of such legislation is to effectively outlaw the majority of terminations.\n\n\u201cYou are in fact killing an innocent human being,\u201d claimed Richard Cash, the state senator who proposed removing protections for rape and incest victims.\n\n\u201cWhether you mean to or not, you are punishing a person wrongfully for something he or she had nothing to do with.\n\n\u201cAnyone who is alive who wa conceived in rape would probably be very glad that they are alive and would probably be very willing to discuss and argue with you about their right to life while in the womb.\u201d\n\nThe exceptions were initially added after Nancy Mace, another Republican state senator, spoke about how she was raped at the age of 16.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
