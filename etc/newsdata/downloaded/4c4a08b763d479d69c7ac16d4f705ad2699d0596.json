(Getty Images)\n\nAlbert Breer of The MMQB tweeted on Wednesday that there has been only one offer made for Gordon, a two-time Pro Bowler.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles made the proposal. Breer said it included Jordan Howard going to the Chargers, a swap of \u201cmid-round\u201d draft picks, and the Chargers eating some of Gordon\u2019s salary too.\n\nLos Angeles declined.\n\nChargers\u2019 high asking price\n\nOn Tuesday, ESPN\u2019s Josina Anderson tweeted that the Chargers were looking for a first-round pick in 2020 or a fifth-round pick in 2020 and first-round pick in 2021 for Gordon, the 15th overall pick in 2015.\n\nIs that price too high?
