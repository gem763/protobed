He leads the league with nine sacks over the first four games. That\u2019s three more Myles Garret and Clay Matthews, who are tied for second with six, and eight more than Aaron Donald, the reigning two-time defensive player of the year. Heck, almost a third of the league\u2019s teams \u2014 the Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, Atlanta Falcons, Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos, New York Jets, Oakland Raiders and Philadelphia Eagles \u2014 don\u2019t yet have nine sacks.\n\nBarrett\u2019s four sacks against the New York Giants in Week 3 tied Tampa Bay\u2019s single-game sack record set by Simeon Rice (2003) and Marcus Jones (2000). That was Barrett\u2019s second consecutive game with at least three sacks, making him the 16th player in NFL history to accomplish that feat and the first since Ezekiel Ansah did it for Detroit in 2017. Since sacks became an official statistic in 1982, only three other players have matched Barrett\u2019s start of nine sacks through the first four games of the season: Mark Gastineau (1984), Kevin Greene (1998) and Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila (2001).\n\nBarrett\u2019s also set up to topple Michael Strahan\u2019s all-time sack record (22\u00bd), set in 2001. During that historic season, Strahan produced just 4\u00bd sacks during the first four games, half of Barrett\u2019s early total. Plus, Barrett has a relatively soft stretch of opponents immediately after Tampa\u2019s Week 7 bye: the Tennessee Titans (Week 8), Seattle Seahawks (Week 9) and Arizona Cardinals (Week 10). Each of those teams ranks 26th or worse at pass protection, according to Football Outsiders\u2019 offensive line metrics. That could offer perfect timing for Barrett to position himself within striking distance of Strahan\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cThis is more than I imagined, honestly,\u201d Barrett told ESPN. \u201cI feel like the sky is the limit. I\u2019m just ready to keep working on the practice field, the film room, keep improving and just trying to help the team win.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBarrett, the NFC Defensive Player of the Month for September, is more than just a sack machine. According to Sports Info Solutions, he ranks second in total pressures (24 sacks, hits, hurries and knockdowns) after Khalil Mack (25), and his interception in Sunday\u2019s upset against the Los Angeles Rams made him the first player in 37 years to record at least eight sacks and an interception in his team\u2019s first four games. Two of Barrett\u2019s four sacks against the Giants caused fumbles, both of which were recovered by Tampa Bay, making him one of seven players in NFL history to produce four sacks and two forced fumbles in a single game.\n\nBy Barrett\u2019s own admission he had just two pass-rush moves out of college, a bull rush and a double swipe, but his improved repertoire \u2014 cultivated while playing alongside Von Miller, DeMarcus Ware and Bradley Chubb in Denver \u2014 has been on full display in 2019. Barrett beat the Panthers offensive line three times in the third quarter, and as David DeChant of Field Level Media pointed out, one of the moves he used against Panthers offensive lineman Daryl Williams was a \u201ccross-chop to rip,\u201d a move similar to the one Atlanta Falcons defensive end Adrian Clayborn employed to record six sacks in a game in 2017.\n\nBarrett used a \u201cpush-pull dip-and-rip\u201d move and an old-fashioned bull rush for the other two, sacks against Williams according to DeChant. It\u2019s worth noting Williams is no turnstile offensive tackle. A knee injury limited him to one game in 2018 but he allowed zero sacks over 56 snaps in that contest. In 2017, he was the league\u2019s highest-rated right tackle, per the game charters at Pro Football Focus.\n\nOther pass-rush techniques used by Barrett this season, per DeChant, include \u201ca stutter inside counter, a mesmerizing Euro-step 2-hand swipe and a double stutter (outside-inside-outside)\u201d against the Giants high-priced left tackle Nate Solder, plus a \u201chand swipe dip-and-rip\u201d that helped force an interception off Rams\u2019 quarterback Jared Goff.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a natural,\u201d Tampa Bay outside linebackers coach Larry Foote told the Tampa Bay Times. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever seen a basketball player who can weave through the defense, he has that. He has those hips who can bend and can move at the same time. All he needs is a little angle to get to the quarterback, and that\u2019s stuff you can\u2019t teach or coach, and he\u2019s just a natural with it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nRussell Wilson is the best franchise quarterback in the NFL\n\nThe Redskins are on the verge of a lost season.
