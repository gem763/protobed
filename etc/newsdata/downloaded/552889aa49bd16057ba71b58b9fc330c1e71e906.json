The vast majority are mild or moderate injuries \u2013 but these can still prove deadly.\n\nThe study, which was published in the Lancet medical journal, spanned 29 countries, with the analysis focusing on more than 9,000 patients who were treated within three hours of injury and were randomly allocated to receiving the drug, or a placebo, intravenously. The cost of the total dose of tranexamic acid used in the trial was about \u00a36.20 per person.\n\nAt first glance, there appeared to be no significant difference in the risk of death within 28 days of injury between those given the drug and those given the placebo. However, further analysis showed the effect depended upon the severity of the injury.\n\nThe drug had no apparent effect on patients with severe traumatic brain injury \u2013 which Roberts said was likely to be down to patients either having already had heavy bleeding in the brain, or because they had other severe damage. \u201cYou can only prevent something that hasn\u2019t already happened,\u201d he said.\n\nFor those with mild or moderate traumatic brain injury, however, the drug lowered the risk of death. Patients given tranexamic acid within three hours of injury had a 22% lower risk of death than those given a placebo: of 2,846 such patients given tranexamic acid, 5.8% died, compared with 7.5% of the 2,769 patients given placebo.\n\n\u201cIf you reduce the bleeding you could save their life because they are bleeding more slowly,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cIf you stop them bleeding it stops them developing a big bruise inside the head which can squash the brain and kill you.\u201d\n\nBut time is of the essence, with the team finding early treatment more effective in these patients.\n\nThe study backs previous, smaller-scale research into the use of tranexamic acid for traumatic brain injury, and additionally shows that the drug does not increase disability, or raise the risk of events such as stroke.\n\n\u201cBearing in mind that 90% of head injuries are mild and moderate, this is very good news because you have got something that can prevent the bleeding into the brain that could kill them, and if they don\u2019t die they are in good shape,\u201d said Roberts.", "description": "Researchers say tranexamic acid treatment has potential to save tens of thousands of lives", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0c679d6b761214a90634812d05c1bd372d662b/0_30_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c537d97e22351709aaca28f57aad1f7", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
