Jamaal Bailey (D-Bronx) that would scrap section 50-a of the New York Civil Rights Law, which deems police personnel records confidential.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe NYPD has used the law to withhold information about complaints against and disciplinary history of police officers, including Daniel Pantaleo, the officer fired for the death of Eric Garner.\n\nDe Blasio and Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill have called for an overhaul of 50-a to allow the NYPD to release more information about disciplinary cases. But the mayor does not support the repeal legislation, a spokeswoman told POLITICO.\n\n\u201cThe Mayor has been vocal in his advocacy of 50-a reform,\u201d said spokeswoman Olivia Lapeyrolerie. But she said legislation \u201cmust balance transparency and safety.\u201d\n\nNYPD first deputy commissioner Ben Tucker was scheduled to testify at Thursday\u2019s Senate hearing, but did not show. The Civilian Complaint Review Board also pulled out.\n\nThe police department supports reforming but not fully repealing the state law, said department spokeswoman Devora Kaye.\n\n\u201cNYPD leaders have made their position on supporting reforms to 50-a clear and maintain that it remains important to increase transparency and accountability in policing,\u201d she said.\n\nThe NYPD for years routinely released disciplinary decisions against officers despite the law, but in 2016 city officials decided the law required them to keep those rulings secret.\n\nLawmakers are planning a push to get the repeal legislation passed in Albany in the session that starts in January.\n\n\u201cFamilies cannot get even the most basic details about the officers who have killed our loved ones,\u201d said Valerie Bell, the mother of Sean Bell, an unarmed man shot to death by police in Queens in 2006.\n\n\u201cThe part that was terrible was not getting answers,\u201d she said. \u201cNot being able to get answers was like losing Sean over and over again. You cannot imagine the pain this causes parents and family members.\u201d\n\nThe law \u201cis dangerous for New Yorkers, because it protects officers who kill, officers who rape and sexually assault, officers who disrespect and brutalize us,\u201d added Constance Malcolm, the mother of Ramarley Graham, who was killed in 2012. \u201cThey hide behind secrecy that the government should not allow.\u201d\n\nSeparate bills sponsored by state Sen. Kevin Parker would repeal parts, but not all, of the secrecy law. Parker said he also supports a full repeal.\n\nPolice unions are fighting the push to repeal the law.\n\n\u201cOur concern is the safety of our members of our police department, their children, and their spouses. And it\u2019s a very, very real danger,\u201d said Paul DiGiacomo, vice president of the Detective Endowment Association.\n\nThe law also applies to correction officers and firefighters, though courts have held that disciplinary cases against correction officers can be released by the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings.\n\nCorrection Officers Benevolent Association president Elias Husamudeen said the law should not be repealed \u2014 and should actually be expanded to shield more disciplinary information for jail guards. Allowing access to personnel records would \u201cincrease their vulnerability to harassment or reprisals,\u201d he said.", "description": "The police department supports reforming but not fully repealing the state law, said department spokeswoman Devora Kaye.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a-BillDeBlasio_13.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
