It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences,\" Silver said.\n\n\"However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way,\" he added.\n\nThe league has faced bipartisan criticism in Washington over the issue, with lawmakers demanding the NBA stand up for free expression following an initial statement from Silver in which he apologized for upsetting Chinese fans.", "description": "A Chinese sports federation has canceled a fan event ahead of an NBA exhibition game, blaming comments made by\u00a0league\u00a0commissioner Adam Silver and Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/chinanba1_100919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
