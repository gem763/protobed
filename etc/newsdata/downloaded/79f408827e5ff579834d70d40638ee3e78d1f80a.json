The episode sees podcast host PJ Vogt perform a surprisingly nuanced deep dive into America\u2019s feral hogs problem. It turns out there are literally millions of the creatures roaming across America, destroying crops and causing massive problems for American farmers, their population egged on by a hunting industry that benefits from being able to charge people to kill them.\n\nThere\u2019s a dark side to the feral hogs tweet, of course. It\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that McNabb was essentially suggesting that the only response to the feral hogs problem is to allow ordinary American citizens to purchase and use assault weapons. But that\u2019s not what Reply All\u2019s episode is arguing. Instead, it simply wants to make its listeners aware of the problem in the first place, and to explain why no one\u2019s been able to find a compromise-free solution.", "description": "Internet culture podcast Reply All has done a deep dive into the \u2018feral hogs\u2019 viral tweet from back in August.
