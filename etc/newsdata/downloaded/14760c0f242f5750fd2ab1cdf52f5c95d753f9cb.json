He said this led to the risk of adverse effects when drugs interact with each other.\n\n\u2018Most drugs have been tested in younger people, and tested in people without multiple diseases,\u2019 he told a House of Lords committee. \u2018When we use a drug at a dose that is licensed, we\u2019re often poisoning the elderly because of the doses we are using.\n\n\u2018This is largely because as you get older your renal function declines and you also have drug interactions.\n\nPensioners are being poisoned by medication because the elderly are excluded from clinical trials, warned Sir Munir Pirmohamed (stock image)\n\n\u2018Most patients I see now are on ten, 15, 20 drugs, and that means you get three, four, five-way interactions. So drug reactions are common in this group and they\u2019re often not picked up in clinical care.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very easy to prescribe drugs, but it\u2019s very hard to stop drugs. When someone is taking 15 drugs it\u2019s very difficult to decide which should be stopped.\u2019\n\nSir Munir said 6.5 per cent of patients at hospitals were admitted because of drug reactions, costing the NHS \u00a31.6billion.\n\nThe academic is a non-executive director for NHS England and professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Liverpool University.\n\nOlder patients are often unable to process strong pills yet can be prescribed between ten and 20 different types of medication at once (stock image)\n\nProfessor Miles Witham, of the National Institute for Health Research, called for a change in regulations to ensure drugs firms included older people and those taking several medications in their trials.\n\nHe said the elderly had been neglected because they can \u2018spoil nice clean trials\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018In the real world people with heart failure have a common age of 85, but in clinical trials the average age is 65 and that gap is extremely common whichever disease you look at. The evidence we gain from clinical trials is actually not fit for purpose in many cases.\u2019", "description": "Older patients can be prescribed between ten and 20 different types of medication at once.
