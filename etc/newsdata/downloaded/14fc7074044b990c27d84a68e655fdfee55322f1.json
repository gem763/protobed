Gavin Newsom (D) signed legislation Friday to limit rifle purchases by Californians.\n\nThe Sacramento Bee reports the legislation limiting rifle purchases was sponsored by Anthony Portantino (D-La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge). The Bee also reports similar legislation was vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown (D) on three different occasions.\n\nBut Newsom signed it, thereby expanding California\u2019s one-handgun-a-month rule to include semiautomatic centerfire long guns as well.\n\nIn the signing the purchase limits, Newsom intimated he is still unsure about the number of guns Californians should be able to buy.\n\nHe said:\n\nThere\u2019s a sense that if you feel like someone has a right to access something, you can restrict it but with certain limitations. We\u2019ve done that with other types of weapons and used that model of one a month for those types of weapons, so my thinking was, \u201cAll right, this is at least consistent with previous established efforts.\u2019 But it\u2019s a legitimate and open-ended question of what\u2019s that appropriate number.\u201d\n\nNewsweek reports Newsom also signed a bill will requiring that firearm parts\u2013particularly those use to build rifles at home\u2013will now have to be purchased, \u201cthrough a licensed vendor.\u201d California already has the same law for ammunition, prohibiting bullets purchases from anyone other than state-approved vendor.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
