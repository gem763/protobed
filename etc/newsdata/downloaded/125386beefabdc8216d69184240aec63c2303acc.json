Libra is intended to be pegged to a basket of currencies including the dollar, the euro, and the yen.\n\nDimon's remarks come after a rough two weeks for Facebook's Libra.\n\nRead more: Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency plan just got formalized, but a quarter of its backers have now dropped out\n\n\n\nThe firm announced Libra in June, along with a coalition of 28 initial backers who would help govern the currency and get it off the ground, expected to be the end of 2020.\n\nThrough October, a quarter of those backers dropped out, including Mastercard, Visa, Stripe, and PayPal, leaving Facebook with no major payment partners. The remaining 21 partners, including Spotify, Uber, and Lyft, confirmed their commitment to the currency in mid-October.\n\nBut politicians and regulators remain suspicious. The G7 group of wealthy nations said this month that stablecoins shouldn't be permitted to launch until they properly address all the financial risks. The worry is that new currencies might be funnelled into funding terrorist or criminal activity. And France has said that it will block Libra from operating in Europe.\n\nA Libra executive also recently suggested that the currency won't be ready to launch by the end of 2020, as originally planned.\n\nFacebook's Libra chief David Marcus has scrambled both to defend the currency, and to emphasise that it will be overseen by all its partners and not just Facebook.\n\nDimon has long been a cryptocurrency skeptic. He famously described bitcoin as \"a fraud\", though he then said he regretted making those comments. He later said he believes in the technology that underpins bitcoin, the blockchain, and JPMorgan in February became the first US bank to launch its own cryptocurrency.\n\nYou can watch Dimon's remarks in CNBC's YouTube video of the conference below from 34'32:", "description": "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is a Libra detractor.
