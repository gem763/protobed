Despite dragging the fight to the ground in Round 1, he wasn\u2019t able to put away Saricam.\n\nIn Round 2, Mowry took his undefeated opponent to the ground again. This time, he saw the opening he was looking for and seized the moment. Mowry grabbed a hold of Saricam\u2019s arm and cranked it behind his back. With the brutal torque on his shoulder and arm, it didn\u2019t take long for Saricam to tap out.\n\nThe submission was Mowry\u2019s fifth and it marked his seventh career finish.\n\nMowry\u2019s performance seemingly impressed Bellator president Scott Coker, who tweeted out a video of Mowry\u2019s submission.
