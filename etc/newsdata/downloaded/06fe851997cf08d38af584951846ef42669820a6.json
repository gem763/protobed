They\u2019re wrong \u2014 and the reasons why they\u2019re wrong should guide Washington\u2019s reactions now.\n\nTrump is right: His restraint back then showed strength, not weakness. Iran\u2019s rulers desperately want some disproportionate US response, because they need to escape the box of US economic sanctions.\n\nAs James Jay Carafano put it in Thursday\u2019s Post, \u201cThe regime is flailing \u2026 Iran has lost approximately 90% of its oil-export markets. Over the long term, that\u2019s close to a death sentence for the Iranian economy. Make no mistake, the mullahs are acting up out of weakness.\u201d\n\nThe Saudi hit was another, bigger bid at the same goal \u2014 accompanied, again, by loud Iranian denials of wrongdoing.\n\nIf the president looks trigger-happy now, it could embolden other nations to get serious about end-running the sanctions. The prospect of a major Mideast war could panic oil markets \u2014 putting a different pressure on Trump to cut some face-saving deal that leaves Iran still free to go nuclear and march toward regional hegemony.\n\nTehran is escalating, and Washington should discourage that. But not at the cost of undermining a policy that\u2019s working.\n\nNoise from Iran\u2019s leaders about how they\u2019ll never negotiate unless sanctions are lifted and are \u201cset for all-out war\u201d is just another part of their game. It\u2019s supposed to make the president think he\u2019ll look weak if he shows restraint and out of control if he acts.\n\nAll of which means that the best response is one that lets Iran know it\u2019ll pay a higher price if it keeps escalating but doesn\u2019t come off as provocative in the eyes of the world.\n\nWhether that\u2019s diplomatic (publicly restarting talks toward a joint defense agreement with the Saudis and other Mideast allies, as Carafano suggested) or some deniable unconventional action (such as a cyberattack) is up to the president to work out with his advisers.\n\nStay tough \u2014 but stay smart, too.", "description": "Trump is right: His restraint back then showed strength, not weakness.
