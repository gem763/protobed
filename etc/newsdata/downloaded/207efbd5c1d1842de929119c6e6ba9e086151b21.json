Democrats have taken particular issue with Facebook\u2019s decision to allow an ad from President Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign that included falsehoods about former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) responded to Facebook\u2019s decision by running her own campaign ad, satirically stating that Zuckerberg supports Trump for reelection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZuckerberg framed the issue as part of a broader debate over free expression, warning about the dangers of social networks, including Facebook, \u201cpotentially cracking down too much.\u201d He called on the United States to set an example for tailored regulation in contrast with other countries, including China, that censor political speech online. And Zuckerberg stressed Facebook must stand strong against governments that seek to \u201cpull back\u201d on free speech in the face of heightened social and political tensions.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s appearance in Washington marks his most forceful attempt to articulate his vision for how governments and tech giants should approach the Web\u2019s most intractable problems. The scale of Facebook and its affiliated apps, Instagram and WhatsApp, which make up a virtual community of billions of users, poses challenges for Zuckerberg and regulators around the world as they struggle to contain hate speech, falsehoods, violent imagery and terrorist propaganda on social media.\n\nNext week, Zuckerberg is set to testify at a congressional hearing that will probably serve as a wide-ranging review of the company\u2019s business practices. Facebook\u2019s size, meanwhile, has become a primary object of derision from some Democrats seeking the White House in 2020, who contend that Facebook is too big, powerful and problematic and should be regulated or broken apart.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe election lends new urgency to Facebook\u2019s issues. The social network became a major platform for disinformation during the 2016 race, and experts say the forms of manipulation and deception have evolved since then, including the arrival of deepfakes, or videos that convincingly distort what a subject is doing or saying using artificial intelligence. A fake clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), doctored to make her appear drunk, that went viral on Facebook in May drew attention to the problem.\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook has work to do to combat such digital ills. He revealed that Facebook has been \u201cworking through what our policy should be\u201d on deepfake videos. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting pretty close to at least rolling out the first version of it,\u201d Zuckerberg said. He declined to provide additional details.\n\nThe tech giant declined to take down the video, though it did later append a notation that it was false, drawing sharp criticism from the House speaker and others that the company had failed to address a blatant lie.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAsked if the Pelosi incident illustrated a serious gap at Facebook, Zuckerberg agreed. \u201cIf anything becomes a big issue, and we haven\u2019t already prepared for it, then that means we were too slow in preparing for it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think figuring out which types of deepfakes are actually a threat today, versus are a theoretical future threat once the technology advances, is one of the things that we need to make sure we get right.\u201d\n\nBut Zuckerberg stood behind the way Facebook, which has long eschewed fact-checking political ads, handles political ads. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the right place on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, in a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign ad about the Bidens made claims about their connections to Ukraine, a critical element in the congressional impeachment inquiry. Biden\u2019s campaign asked Facebook to remove the ad, describing it as false, but the social network declined, pointing to a policy against fact-checking such political speech. The company\u2019s response drew widespread rebukes from Biden and other 2020 Democratic candidates, including Warren, many of whom have charged that Facebook essentially is profiting from misinformation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking at Georgetown later Thursday, Zuckerberg acknowledged the company once considered prohibiting political ads but decided against it, believing it \u201cfavors incumbents and whoever the media covers.\u201d\n\nBut a spokesman for Biden\u2019s campaign, Bill Russo, later assailed Zuckerberg for an unconvincing rationale. \u201cZuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company\u2019s bottom line,\u201d Russo said, \u201cand his choice to cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.\u201d\n\nFacebook has faced a barrage of criticism from both sides of the aisle about what content it censors. Republicans, for example, have contended that the company censors conservative users and news websites, a charge the company has long denied.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOften, the people who call the most for us to remove content are often the first to complain when it\u2019s their content that falls on the wrong side of a policy,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cThese are very complex issues, and in general, unless it is absolutely clear what to do, I think you want to err on the side of greater expression.\u201d\n\nFor many Democrats, however, Trump\u2019s ads expose vast vulnerabilities at Facebook that malicious actors could exploit to spread misinformation targeting the 2020 presidential election, just as Russian agents used Facebook and other social media sites to spread falsehoods, sow social and political unrest, and undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nZuckerberg stressed that he believes Facebook is in a \u201cmuch better place now\u201d to stop such disinformation campaigns, citing the company\u2019s investments in staff and artificial intelligence. But he also cautioned that misinformation is a threat that one \u201ccould never say that it\u2019s going to go away, because they\u2019re going to keep on pushing.\u201d In recent months, Facebook has reported disinformation campaigns from countries including Iran and China.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe blamed the U.S. government\u2019s lack of initial response as part of the reason the problem has worsened since the last presidential election. \u201cUnfortunately, the U.S. did not have a particularly strong response to Russia after 2016,\u201d he continued, \u201cso it sent the signal to other countries that they could get in on this, too.\"\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s speech comes seven months after he issued his initial call for governments to adopt \u201crules for the Internet,\u201d and tech giants, including Facebook, to set up systems so that no one executive or company determines what is or isn\u2019t appropriate online. Facebook is actively setting up a \u201csupreme court\u201d of sorts so that users can appeal the company\u2019s decisions about the content it leaves up or takes down.\n\nOn Thursday, though, Zuckerberg's message served more as a warning that overreaction could stifle the very sort of speech that many regulators seek to protect.\n\nHe said a common perception these days is that \u201cmore people having a voice is leading to division, and not bringing people together,\u201d he said. \u201cIn times of social tension we pull back on expression, and we always end up believing that it was the wrong thing to do.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview with The Washington Post that he worries \u201cabout an erosion of truth\u201d online but defended the policy allowing politicians to peddle ads containing misrepresentations and lies on his social network, a stance that has sparked an outcry during the 2020 presidential campaign.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4xja5VIqugNrXd2BX5Vh82NV-UY=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-17-2019/t_3964141fcf12437482e54c82ab74b772_name_20191017_Zuckerberg_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
