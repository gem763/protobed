The feature is now rolling out to everyone with the latest iOS 13.2 update.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t updated your phone yet, you should go to Settings > General > Software Update to download and install the latest version.\n\nAccording to the iPhone maker, the new feature enhances the level of details and reduces noise in a photo, thanks to \u201ccomputational photography mad science.\u201d Behind the scenes, the phone takes multiple frames at different exposures, and then processes pixel by pixel to improve the image quality; just like SmartHDR, but smarter.\n\nTo use Deep Fusion, you don\u2019t have to do anything fancy. Just go to the camera app and start taking photos. The feature is enabled automatically, and you don\u2019t need to press any buttons to switch it on.\n\nBut what if you want to see the difference between a non-Deep Fusion and a Deep Fusion photo? Go to Settings > Camera, and turn on the Photos Capture Outside the Frame toggle. Apple says Deep Fusion doesn\u2019t work in that mode.I\u2019d like to see the camera app gain a toggle button for this in its main interface.\n\nHere are two photos I took from my iPhone 11 \u2013 the first one is with Deep Fusion, and the second one is without. As you can see, it\u2019s quite hard to spot any improvements in this instance. At the moment, the internet\u2019s quite divided on declaring Deep Fusion as the camera feature of the year.\n\nA photo with Deep Fusion A photo without Deep Fusion That said, it\u2019s possible to get better results in some circumstances. We tested Deep Fusion using the iOS 13.2 developer beta earlier this month, and we were quite impressed with the detail in those trial shots. We\u2019ll surely be taking photos of more blankets and sweaters with the stable rollout to see if the feature really makes a world of a difference to iPhone 11\u2019s photos.
