The 35-year-old right-hander is 4-0 with an 0.95 ERA in four career elimination starts, including last week's wild-card win at Oakland.\n\n\"It's just what Charlie's done all year,\" manager Kevin Cash said. \"He's got that knack for doing some special things for us, and he did it again.\"\n\nAstros manager AJ Hinch announced after the game that Houston will start Justin Verlander on three days of rest in Game 4 of the best-of-five matchup at Tropicana Field on Tuesday. Tampa Bay will use Diego Castillo as an opener.\n\n\"He's one of the best pitchers in the world. No more complicated than that,\" Hinch said of Verlander. \"He's ready, and it's his game.\"\n\nKiermaier got the wild-card Rays going with his long home run in the second inning. Ji-Man Choi and Brandon Lowe added solo shots off Greinke, who has never won in Tampa Bay, and Willy Adames added a solo blast against Wade Miley in the sixth.\n\nTampa Bay's four home runs matched a franchise record for a post-season game. The Rays also went deep four times against the Boston Red Sox during the 2008 AL Championship Series and did it again during last week's 5-1 wild-card victory against the Athletics.\n\n\"For us to put three runs on the board, that felt great. That was huge for us,\" Kiermaier said. \"After that, it's just, 'Hey, Charlie Morton, go do your thing, go do what you do.' And he did just that.\"\n\nAltuve shines\n\nJose Altuve homered for the Astros, who are one victory away from their third straight appearance in the ALCS, and had two of Houston's three hits off Morton. It was Altuve's 10th career post-season home run, tied with Chase Utley for the most by a second baseman in major league history.\n\nMorton, who won 29 games for Houston over two seasons before joining the Rays as a free agent last off-season, departed with an 8-1 lead. Four relievers finished the combined seven-hitter for the Rays, who have never been swept in a playoff series.\n\nNow, they must avoid being \"Verlandered\" \u2014 a term coined by Cash after the series opener \u2014 in Game 4.\n\n\"He's tough. We've got to enjoy what we accomplished today and certainly hope we can have better at-bats, production, get something going against him,\" Cash said. \"We'll worry about that [Tuesday]. Right now, the guys are pretty pumped about what they just did tonight.\"\n\nVerlander, who pitched seven scoreless inning to win Game 1, has only started on fewer than the standard four days of rest once. That was in the 2011 ALDS, when his first appearance was limited to one inning by rain.\n\n\"The thought process is five-game series are pretty crazy and we've got to win. Never know what can happen,\" Verlander said. \"You can't put all your eggs in one basket and say if we lose tomorrow, we've got Justin and Gerrit [Cole] for Game 5. It's a crazy game.\"", "description": "Kevin Kiermaier hit a go-ahead, three-run homer as Tampa Bay teed off on Zack Greinke, and the Rays backed another clutch playoff pitching performance by Charlie Morton to beat the visiting Houston Astros 10-3 Monday and cut their American League Division Series deficit to 2-1.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312427.1570489959!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/morton-charlie-191007-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
