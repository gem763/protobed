It is unclear what these individuals are alleging or what departments they work in.\n\nMark Zaid, the activist attorney representing the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d at the center of the impeachment probe, told the Daily Beast that he anticipates more government employees will come forward with allegations of wrongdoing committed by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThere are clearly numerous whistleblowers out there and many people who possess firsthand relevant information who could come forward, and I expect some will,\u201d Zaid predicted.\n\n\u201cOne knowledgeable source said that the daily accumulation of revelations about Trump\u2019s willingness to use U.S. foreign relations for his personal political benefit has prompted more people to approach Congress,\u201d the Daily Beast reports. \u201cInvestigators are using the soon-to-expire congressional recess to vet the accounts they\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Beast, House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) refused to comment on the veracity of the news outlet\u2019s report because \u201cpeople can reverse-engineer who whistleblowers are.\u201d\n\nSchiff, whose conduct amid the impeachment probe has received the formal condemnation of 109 Republican congressmen, previously made false statements regarding his panel\u2019s contacts with the initial so-called \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d\n\nNot only has Schiff\u2019s credibility been called into question, but so has the so-called \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d The Washington Examiner reported Thursday that the officer, said to be a registered Democrat, worked with then-vice president Joe Biden while serving in the White House. Equipped with only secondhand information, the officer alleged President Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against Biden and his son, Hunter. Both presidents have denied any pressure was applied and the White House published a transcript of the world leaders\u2019 call to dispel allegations of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThere was no blackmail,\u201d Zelensky told reporters this week when asked about the July 25th call. \u201cWe are not servants. We are an independent country.\u201d", "description": "More so-called \"whistleblowers\" have reportedly reached out to congressional investigators in the wake of the Democrats' impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178869124-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
