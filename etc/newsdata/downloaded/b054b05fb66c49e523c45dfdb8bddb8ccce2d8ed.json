He livestreamed his attack on Twitch, during which he referred to himself as \u201cAnon\u201d (likely referencing 4chan or 8chan) and espoused far-right talking points. Now, the livestream platform has released a statement explaining how such an egregious violation slipped through its net.\n\nOn Twitter, Twitch outlined what happened from its perspective, opening with an acknowledgement that while it has a \u201ca zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct,\u201d the stream nonetheless lasted 35 minutes, was viewed by five people while it was live, and was passed around to 2,200 people in the additional 30 minutes after it ended, before Twitch took it down. The issue, according to Twitch, is that the stream generated most of its heat off-platform.\n\n\u201cThis account was created about two months prior to streaming the shooting and had attempted to stream only once before,\u201d said Twitch. \u201cThis video was not surfaced in any recommendations or directories; instead, our investigation suggests that people were coordinating and sharing the video via other online messaging services.\u201d\n\nThe company has since shared a version of the recording with an \u201cindustry consortium\u201d to help stop it from spreading further.\n\nThis is not the first time a shooter has livestreamed their acts of violence. Most notoriously, the Christchurch mosque shooter who killed 51 people and injured 49 earlier this year streamed the attack on Facebook Live.\n\nRecordings of the shooting were also uploaded to Twitch, which in June prompted the company to sue 100 anonymous users to reveal the identities of those who put the recordings \u2014 in addition to pornography, copyrighted videos, and other terms of service violations \u2014 on their platform.\n\nAs of now, Twitch says it\u2019s \u201ccontinuing to investigate the Halle event\u201d and will ban any accounts that repost recordings of it.\n\n\u201cWe take this extremely seriously and are committed to working with industry peers, law enforcement, and any relevant parties to protect our community,\u201d said the company.", "description": "Thursday, an armed gunman in Halle, Germany attacked people outside of a synagogue on Yom Kippur, one of the holiest days on the Jewish calendar, killing two and injuring at least two others in the process.
