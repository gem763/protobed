Photo: Courtesy of the Retailer\n\nWhile choosing a coffee table may feel like both an overwhelming and an unsexy task, there are things to consider \u2014 beyond your overall aesthetic \u2014 to make the process a little less daunting. Nina Gottlieb, director of hospitality and contract design at West Elm, points out that it\u2019s helpful to consider the proportions and relative mass of each piece in your living room. \u201cSometimes, if you have a super-leggy couch, you don\u2019t want a super-leggy coffee table. Or if you have a sofa that\u2019s upholstered all the way to the ground, you don\u2019t want a super-massive coffee table because then everything feels too heavy,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to experiment with nontraditional shapes and materials. There are plenty of fun designs out there that range from the tried-and-true (mid-century design, for example, doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere) to the unexpected (consider a table with pool noodles for legs) that you can incorporate without turning your living room into a mismatched playhouse.\n\nTo help you find the coffee table that works best with your budget and your space \u2014 whether you want to make it the focus of your room or have it play a more supporting, holding-the-remote-control kind of role \u2014 we polled 24 interior designers on their favorites. Below, 50 coffee tables organized by style and material.\n\nBest modern coffee tables: Acrylic\n\nCB2 Peekaboo Acrylic Coffee Table If you\u2019re looking for a coffee table that doesn\u2019t distract from the other furniture in your room, interior designer Dee Murphy recommends this curved acrylic number from CB2, which she likes to use in a space \u201cwhere I feel the eye needs a \u2018rest\u2019\u201d \u2014 in a room that has a lot of color or pattern, for example, or even in a small space. \u201cThe table won\u2019t crowd or compete with the rest of the furniture or d\u00e9cor. It also works well with all design styles,\u201d she says. We can picture this going quite nicely with an Eames lounger or an overstuffed wingback chair upholstered in a jaunty print. $279 at CB2 Buy\n\n55 Downing Street Hanna Acrylic Modern Coffee Table Gold finishes make this acrylic table a little more interesting. According to Abbe Fenimore, founder of interior design firm Studio Ten 25, an acrylic or glass coffee table layers particularly well with a statement rug. We like its Hollywood Regency vibe. $600 at Amazon Buy\n\nFelicity Acrylic Coffee Table $749 (was $999, now 25% off) This acrylic table has a more traditional four-post silhouette (and serious \u201980s vibes) and comes recommended by founder and lead designer Maggie Griffin of Maggie Griffin Design. It\u2019s a favorite of hers for its price and the fact that it can be wiped down easily (i.e., it\u2019s good for kids). $749 at Ballard Designs Buy\n\nItalian Square Plexiglass Modern Coffee Table Produced by Minotti For a modern look, interior designer Elizabeth Stuart also favors plexiglass, and she recommends this coffee table originally manufactured by Minotti. \u201cA coffee table like this works every time,\u201d she explains. The thick tabletop gives it heft, while a minimalist chrome frame offsets it. You can even DIY this look \u2014 and take it up a notch \u2014 by grabbing a piece of colored plexiglass and putting it on top of a wooden box. $1,524 at 1stdibs Buy\n\nBest modern coffee tables: Terrazzo\n\nAnthropologie Cleo Coffee Table Although Hollister and Porter Hovey of Hovey Design call terrazzo a trend that is \u201cpractically pass\u00e9\u201d (we\u2019re still fans), they appreciate how beautiful this coffee table looks in its black-and-white color scheme. The thick, rounded legs are on trend, too. The Hovey sisters add that this piece looks more high-end than other tables at this price point. $998 at Anthropologie Buy\n\nVero Coffee Table by Un'common If your love for terrazzo is unapologetic but you also like mixing materials, Mallory Fletchall, interior content creator at Reserve Home, recommends this petite coffee table that combines a speckled tabletop with a warm ash base. Perfect for someone who gets d\u00e9cor inspiration from the Wing. $1,125 at Pamono Buy\n\nBest modern coffee tables: Marble-topped\n\nCB2 Slab Small Marble Coffee Table With Brass Base Marble-topped coffee tables are a popular choice among the experts we spoke to, and this one, recommended by Rayman Boozer of Apartment48, is a solid option. Boozer says it\u2019s especially great for a smaller living space because of its narrow dimensions. He also calls out the brass accents, which \u201csuit a contemporary aesthetic without being too flashy.\u201d We like the proportions of the not-too-thick marble slab and the slender frame. $399 at CB2 Buy\n\nElemental Layers Coffee Table Brass-finished iron legs add a touch of metal to this marble-and-wood table that freelance writer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Heath recommends. She says the mix of materials \u201chelped tie all the elements of our living room together.\u201d The shelf provides bonus storage and a \u201clovely styling opportunity,\u201d she says, meaning your Diptyque candles, stacks of The Gentlewoman, and a vase of peonies. $698 at Anthropologie Buy\n\nThomas Bina Olivia Coffee Table Murphy also recommends this tiered coffee table by Thomas Bina that incorporates a lacquered top, delicate steel legs, and an oak lower shelf for those looking to update the mid-century look. Murphy likes that the tabletop has rounded edges (which she says are babyproof), while the extra shelf is great for storing books or small baskets of knickknacks. $1,595 at One Kings Lane Buy\n\nSecant Table by Sara Wright Polmar for Warm Nordic If you\u2019re going for an \u201ceasy Milanese\u201d vibe, the Hovey sisters recommend the Secant Table (which is actually designed by Sara Wright Polmar, a Norwegian). They call it \u201cone of the most Italian-looking tables we\u2019ve seen\u201d for its streamlined industrial look and, of course, its \u201cheavily veined\u201d marble top. (You can choose a glass top and a base in a different color, if you please.) $839 at Danish Design Store Buy\n\nBest modern coffee tables: Steel\n\nHay Tray Coffee Table For a more straightforward, utilitarian option, Kirsten Grove of We Three Design Studio suggests trying this square, powder-coated-steel table designed by Danish collective Hay that features a tray tabletop (all the better for catching your red-wine spills) and a wiry frame. Grove thinks the simple design lends itself to a variety of d\u00e9cor schemes, including Scandinavian and mid-century. $195 at Design Within Reach Buy\n\nRoom and Board Slim Round Coffee Table in Natural Steel Boozer also recommends a steel coffee table, and this round, simple style has a slim profile, which, he says, \u201csubtly allows you to make bold choices with your other furnishings.\u201d We especially appreciate how smooth and stonelike the finish feels. A second shelf provides always-welcome extra storage. $379 at Room & Board Buy\n\nCrate & Barrel Clairemont Oval Coffee Table Seattle-based designer LeeAnn Baker recommends this oval coffee table, in a shape she says is especially versatile if you are tight on space. She loves the dark-bronze metal frame and the antiqued mirrored lower shelf, noting that \u201cit reads much more expensive\u201d than its price point. Use the double surfaces for your stacks of coffe-table books \u2014 and a place for your friends to put their highballs while watching Succession. $699 at CB2 Buy\n\nBest modern coffee tables: Wood\n\nNow House by Jonathan Adler Josef Cocktail Table, Blonde Wood Fletchall recommends this delightful round, wooden coffee table from Now House by Jonathan Adler, saying that its price point (for a wooden table) and its grooved legs are especially enticing. We like how jovial it looks. $320 at Amazon Buy\n\nJustice Oak Coffee Table Grove recommends this simple, barrel-style solid-oak table from CB2\u2019s collaboration with GQ, calling out it\u2019s \u201corganic,\u201d \u201cmid-century\u201d vibe. We like the way its heavy base anchors it to the space. $799 at CB2 Buy\n\nIndustrial Coffee Table \u201cEtsy is a great resource for well-priced, handmade pieces,\u201d says Eliza McNabb, a designer at Hyphen. She explains that it\u2019s easy to work with vendors to create custom pieces that will fit your space perfectly \u2014 a must for those living in city apartments. It\u2019s also a more affordable first step into the custom-made world, since a coffee table won\u2019t be as expensive as a bed or a dining table, for instance. She recommends this industrial coffee table made from reclaimed wood if you\u2019re going for a farmhouse vibe. $445 at Etsy Buy\n\nBest classic coffee tables: Brass and glass\n\nLulu & Georgia Nicolina Coffee Table Tiered brass and glass give this coffee table a hint of glamour. Murphy suggests placing decorative objects and a vase full of flowers on it to achieve a full Elle Decor look. $583 at Lulu & Georgia Buy\n\nSt. Germain Coffee Table Here\u2019s another brass-and-glass coffee table, this one recommended by Meghan Hackett-Cassidy and Erin Hackett of Bronxville, New York\u2013based Hackett Interiors. They say incorporating glass can \u201celevate the style of a room if you\u2019re looking to create a more formal feeling.\u201d We love those dainty, Frenchy scroll posts. $1,598 at Serena & Lily Buy\n\nAthena Cocktail Table For a Grecian twist, try the Athena cocktail table, recommended by Lance Thomas and Drew Hoffpauir of Lake Charles, Louisiana\u2013based Room Service. They describe it as \u201ctraditional with bite\u201d and like its eglomise glass top and \u201cGreek key\u201d legs, adding that its small frame would fit in any space. $1,348 at Shop Century Buy\n\nAlvis Three-Piece Coffee-Table Set Save on budget \u2014 and space \u2014 with this modular coffee-table set. Ashley Moore, founder and principal designer of Moore House Interiors, recommends this trio of tables, two of which nest underneath the larger one; according to Moore, these are great for \u201cpulling out when you are entertaining.\u201d She says the brass legs and mirrored top give the set a high-end look. $240 at Wayfair Buy\n\nBest classic coffee tables: Wood\n\nWilliams Sonoma Waterfall Coffee Table Murphy recommends this classic square coffee table for being a \u201cdesign chameleon\u201d that can be easily styled in a range of aesthetics. A stone top \u2014 in this case, smooth Carrara marble \u2014 and a base made from wide planks of solid American ash give the table a contemporary Scandinavian vibe that still feels warm. A low shelf offers additional storage space for all your impeccably curated art books. $1,495 at Williams Sonoma Buy\n\nReclaimed Russian Oak Plinth Rectangular Coffee Table For someone whose tastes lean more toward the naturalistic, designer Amee Swarz recommends this reclaimed-oak table with a plinth base. She likes that it\u2019s rustic (rough-hewn planks add warmth, too), simple, and looks like a vintage-store find. $2,375 at Restoration Hardware Buy\n\nOak Plank Rectangular Coffee Table $1,137 (was $1,895, now 40% off) Another coffee table with a plinthlike base that feels just a tad lighter than the one above. It\u2019s recommended by Los Angeles\u2013based designer Kate Lester, who says it\u2019s a staple in her studio. She appreciates the \u201csolid presence\u201d that the kiln-dried oak imparts as well as its \u201csimple yet sophisticated\u201d geometric silhouette. $1,137 at Williams Sonoma Buy\n\nTakhat Reclaimed-Wood Coffee Table This reclaimed-wood coffee table is nice and chunky if you\u2019re going for a truly rustic farmhouse look. Griffin likes its lighter tone. $799 at Pottery Barn Buy\n\nBarley Twist Coffee Table Baker recommends this wooden coffee table inspired by classic Spanish design. A parquet-style inlay top pairs with twisted legs that feel like something out of an old villa. She loves how versatile this transitional (i.e., striking a balance between new and old) piece is, and Griffin agrees, noting that its lighter-wood tone mixes well with more traditional, darker-toned pieces. $1,299 at Wisteria Buy\n\nWorld Market Black Carved-Wood-and-Metal Samir Coffee Table According to the Hovey sisters, introducing a simple black coffee table can add cohesion to a room that is a mash-up of unmatched pieces in different wood finishes you\u2019ve accumulated over the years. \u201cThe black grounds all the browns and makes them seem like they\u2019re all one happy family,\u201d Hollister says. \u201cHere\u2019s one simple black piece that combines clean lines, industrial-yet-delicate metal, and a nice bit of texture, which helps it look good with almost anything.\u201d $250 at World Market Buy\n\nElizabeth Coffee Table $150 (was $218, now 31% off) If you want an extra shelf with your black coffee table, try this one, recommended by Lester. She likes the ebony finish as a break from a more standard stained-wood table, and she agrees with the Hoveys that it would anchor any seating area. She adds that the overall scale is conducive for use in a smaller living space. The slightly out-turned legs are vaguely mid-century, if you\u2019re going for that subtle nod. $150 at AllModern Buy\n\nMid-century-modern coffee tables\n\nHolmes Coffee Table Lester recommends combining two tables to achieve a nesting effect (if you have to get things piecemeal) that adds dimension to your space. She likes the sleek Danish-inspired look of the tabletop contrasted with the waxed black joinery (which in our opinion gives it a little more edge). Lester suggests pairing it with the higher cocktail table, which can also be used as a side table. $740 at Perigold Buy\n\nAmoeba Table Article is a reliable source if you\u2019re looking for quality mid-century-inspired pieces at a reasonable price point, according to McNabb. She suggests pairing two tables from its Amoeba line to create tiers \u2014 and the ability to reconfigure a space whenever necessary. $299 at Article Buy\n\nHem Alle Coffee Table (Set of 2) $740 (was $778, now 5% off) Interior designer Penelope August recommends these delightful nesting tables from Stockholm-based design studio Hem and notes that they would work well with sectionals \u2014 either as a cluster or separately. According to August, \u201cthe two overlapping circles work well in L-sofa configurations where a single table always seems too far from one side or the other.\u201d She notes that they are well priced for being made out of solid oak. $740 at Hem Buy\n\nReeve Mid-Century Rectangular Coffee Table Here\u2019s another Carrara-marble-topped table \u2014 this time with a sleek mid-century-inspired wood base \u2014 that comes recommended by Rachel Schwartzmann, founder of The Style Line and CONNECT(ED)ITORIAL. Schwartzmann herself owns this one and uses the storage shelf for books. $699 at West Elm Buy\n\nThe Tulip Coffee Table by Rove Concepts You can\u2019t go wrong with something inspired by Eero Saarinen\u2019s classic coffee table, especially at this price point. It\u2019s a go-to for Swarz when she\u2019s working on mid-century interiors, and she appreciates that its elegant marble top blends as well with a neutral palette as it does with a bolder color story. $545 at Rove Concepts Buy\n\nWarren Platner Coffee Table $1,484 (was $1,746, now 15% off) Stuart loves this iconic glass-and-steel coffee table from mid-century-modern architect Warren Platner, calling it \u201cdesign at its best.\u201d First introduced in the \u201960s, the table features a base made of curved steel rods and a thick, tempered-glass tabletop. Swarz recommends it for its \u201cairy feeling\u201d and suggests pairing it with a modern sofa or sectional, adding that the top is durable and heat- and scratch-resistant, making it ideal for a family with kids and for entertaining guests. $1,484 at Design Within Reach Buy\n\nBest rattan coffee tables\n\nRosendahl Coffee Table $260 (was $280, now 7% off) Moore and many of the designers we spoke with agree that rattan is all the rage these days. If you want to try incorporating it into your home, try this drumlike coffee table, which Moore recommends. She says it adds just the right amount of texture to a room. It can even double as a seat. $260 at Wayfair Buy\n\nKingsley Bate Havana Indoor-Outdoor Coffee Table Murphy recommends this indoor-outdoor table made from teak in a rattan-inspired design for how \u201cbig, boho, and beachy\u201d it is. She says it\u2019s \u201cthe perfect size for entertaining.\u201d We like how versatile it is: It would look great in a living room or out on a patio or balcony. $590 at Lulu & Georgia Buy\n\nBeverly Rattan Coffee Table $374 (was $499, now 25% off) This round rattan table recommended by Grove also features a glass top. A woven shelf provides extra storage. Grove is impressed with how relatively inexpensive it is \u2014 given that it\u2019s handmade. $374 at Ballard Designs Buy\n\nWoven Coffee Table The Hovey sisters \u201chate sectional sofas with uneven sides\u201d (take a peek at the Floyd here for an idea of what they\u2019re talking about), explaining that they \u201cthrow off the symmetry of a room and make coffee-table selections very hard.\u201d To combat that asymmetry, they suggest adding an extra section to the short side with a square coffee table, like this woven-wicker one that can also work as seating or an ottoman. $600 at Hawkins New York Buy\n\nArteriors Underhill Cocktail Table Baker recommends this boxy coffee table, which she says would work just as well in a contemporary room as in one that leans more traditional. She adds that the organic texture and lower height make it a bit more casual. We like that it reminds us of a tiki bar. $1,785 at Candelabra Buy\n\nBarrel- and drum-style coffee tables\n\nProject 62 Manila Hammered Barrel Coffee Table $142 (was $150, now 5% off) Interior designer Megan Hopp favors a drum-style coffee table for its \u201cstatement-making shape\u201d and \u201cability to anchor a room.\u201d She recommends this metal drum coffee table from Target inspired by Milo Baughman\u2019s iconic cylindrical table. The hammered-brass finish makes it feel fancier than it is. $142 at Target Buy\n\nFernando Metal Drum Coffee Table from Crate and Barrel Hackett Interiors also recommends a circular drum table, especially for rooms with sectionals. \u201cThose rooms are usually a little less formal, which is why we gravitate to the drum,\u201d the designers say, adding that this particular one from Crate and Barrel is \u201csubstantial and effortless.\u201d The powder-coated hammered-iron surface feels cool and earthy. $699 at Crate and Barrel Buy\n\nBina Coffee Table $1,470 (was $1,691, now 13% off) Fenimore notes that round coffee tables work particularly well in busy rooms. She recommends this barrel table by Thomas Bina with a faux-shagreen base and reclaimed-wood top. $1,470 at Perigold Buy\n\nBamileke Outdoor Coffee Table The Bamileke coffee table (another indoor-outdoor style) is Stuart\u2019s choice for a room (or an outdoor space) that hews more natural. \u201cMy favorite bohemian coffee-table style always involves texture,\u201d she says, which is why she likes this resin drum with a basket-weave pattern. $1,598 at Serena & Lily Buy\n\nBest ottoman-style coffee tables\n\nTufted Ottoman From West Elm Which brings us to our next category. Hackett and Hackett-Cassidy are fans of ottomans that double as coffee tables, like this tufted one from West Elm. The upholstery makes it comfy, while the slender metal frame keeps it from feeling too heavy. $799 at West Elm Buy\n\nCloud Modular Fabric Waterfall Coffee Table Ottoman For something truly two-in-one, Lester recommends this modular hybrid coffee-table ottoman from Restoration Hardware. She loves the versatility of this piece: The waterfall table can be moved or completely removed if desired. $750 at Restoration Hardware Buy\n\nPhoto: Jessica Isaac Shoppe Amber Interiors Topanga Ottoman For another seating-as-table option, try this upholstered ottoman, whcih comes recommended from designer Becky Shea. It\u2019s covered in a vintage striped kilim textile that she says adds coziness to a room \u2014 as well as a little texture and history. We can imagine placing this in front of a fireplace with all our favorite magazines strewn on top of it. $2,495 at Shoppe Amber Interiors Buy\n\nBest nontraditional coffee tables\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that everyone seated in a living room should have a place to rest their coffee or cocktail,\u201d say the Hovey sisters. But according to them, many affordable coffee-table options are too small for everyone to have \u201creachable access to a decent surface.\u201d Their solution to the \u201ctiny-table curse,\u201d as they call it? \u201cEven tinier tables.\u201d They suggest using a cluster of sculptural tables to increase surface area when a single coffee table won\u2019t cut it. \u201cA cluster of three accent tables in contrasting shapes and styles like these can provide exponentially more visual interest than one slightly larger one,\u201d they explain.\n\nPool Table by Another Human This Pool Table is \u201cart furniture as a conversation piece,\u201d according to designer Elena Frampton of Frampton Co. This postmodern \u201cobject\u201d is made from an acrylic top with wavy edges that\u2019s supported by pool noodles covering acrylic-rod legs. If you want something that\u2019s certainly different from your typical coffee table but still does the job, this is it. \u201cIt ensures your house doesn\u2019t look like a showroom,\u201d she adds. $3,150 at 1stdibs Buy\n\nChristophe Delcourt Lob Low Table This gorgeous table designed by Christophe Delcourt (and recommended by Shea), would look right at home in Kanye and Kim Kardashian West\u2019s \u201cminimal monastery,\u201d which is partly why we like it so much \u2014 despite its extremely prohibitive cost. Shea loves the interplay between the \u201cbrutalist travertine and soft walnut.\u201d The proportions are just right, too: The slab of stone appears to float between the wide wooden legs. $15,570 at The Future Perfect Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
