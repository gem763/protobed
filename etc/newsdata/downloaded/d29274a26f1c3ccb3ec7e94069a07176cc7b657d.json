Third parties could have used that feature to harvest the information.\n\nThe databases have since been pulled offline after the web host was contacted, TechCrunch said.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nPhone numbers linked to as many as 419 million Facebook accounts were recently found on an online server that was not protected by a password, according to a TechCrunch report on Wednesday.\n\nFacebook told Business Insider that there was no evidence that any users had their accounts compromised and that the number of affected users was likely around half of what TechCrunch reported, as its team analyzed the data set and found duplicate records. Facebook would not put an exact number to the users it estimated to be affected by the exposure, but half of the reported number would be around 200 million users.\n\nThe database was brought to TechCrunch\u2019s attention by a security researcher, who discovered the information sitting in plaintext \u2013 meaning it wasn\u2019t encrypted at all. This information appears to have been gathered by a third party, who left it exposed to the internet. The database was taken offline after the web host was contacted, TechCrunch said.\n\nThe information in question, according to the report, included users\u2019 Facebook IDs \u2013 which are strings of numbers used by the company to uniquely identify an account \u2013 and the associated phone number for each account. Some records are said to have included the user\u2019s name, gender, and country in which they resided.\n\nTechCrunch reported that 133 million of the 419 million records discovered on the server were associated with American users.\n\nThe issue, a Facebook spokesperson told Business Insider on Wednesday, stemmed from a feature, which has since been shut down, that allowed users to search for friends by their phone numbers. Facebook said malicious actors were able to use this feature to scrape information, including phone numbers, from users\u2019 accounts.\n\nFacebook shut down the ability to search for friends by phone number in April 2018.\n\n\u201cThis dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year to remove people\u2019s ability to find others using their phone numbers,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told Business Insider. \u201cThe dataset has been taken down and we have seen no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised. The underlying issue was addressed as part of a Newsroom post on April 4th 2018 by Facebook\u2019s Chief Technology Officer.\u201d\n\nRead more: Instagram\u2019s lax privacy practices let a trusted partner track millions of users\u2019 physical locations, secretly save their stories, and flout its rules\n\nThe finding is the latest example of data-protection issues surrounding the social-networking giant. Just last month, Business Insider\u2019s Rob Price reported that Facebook was launching a review of hundreds marketing and advertising firms amid indications of widespread misuse of Instagram user data, including data scraping of users\u2019 public data without their consent.", "description": "Business Insider - Some records also included the user's name, gender, and country in which they resided, according to TechCrunch..
