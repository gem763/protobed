I respected Paul Wesley. I didn't like Paul Wesley,' said the dual citizen of Canada and Bulgaria.\n\nThe brunette bombshell recalled: 'I remember everyone would walk up to me after the show aired and they'd be like: \"Are you and Paul dating in real life?\" because everyone thought that we had such good chemistry.'\n\nNina, who once dated Vampire Diaries star Ian Somerhalder, gave the credit to 'a fine line between love and hate, and we despised each other so much that it read as love. We really just didn\u2019t get along the first maybe five months of shooting.'\n\nOff she goes: In a tongue-in-cheek Instagram video, Nina apologizes to Paul for the bad 'press' about them, and he makes a show of forgiving her - before tossing her in the pool\n\nTaking the plunge: Nina had appeared on the Directionally Challenged podcast in June and shared that she initially 'despised' Paul during the shoot before they began to get along\n\nThe remarks got a great deal of media attention, and Nina discussed the matter when she swung by the podcast Chicks In The Office this week.\n\n'I have to first of all say that the story was blown out of proportion to such a crazy degree, I've never seen anything like it in my life, for two reasons,' she said.\n\n'One...what? Like, why? I mean, what else - I guess nothing else was happening that week, 'cause every outlet picked it up,' Nina remembered.\n\n'Like it was, like I felt like I was Brangelina, and you know what, you guys? We're not, okay?' she said, getting a laugh from hostesses Ria Ciuffo and Francesca Mariano.\n\nRevisit: The remarks got a great deal of media attention, and Nina discussed the matter when she swung by the podcast Chicks In The Office this week\n\nSo wild: 'I have to first of all say that the story was blown out of proportion to such a crazy degree, I've never seen anything like it in my life, for two reasons,' she said\n\nNina explained that 'you become a family on set. You spend every waking moment together, probably more moments than you do with your real family, because you're there from like five in the morning until midnight, 6am sometimes.'\n\nShe went on: 'And so you see each other with makeup, without makeup, on good days, on bad days, when you're hungry, when you're thirsty, when you're tired.'\n\nNina added: 'So there's gonna be mood swings and it was one of those things that we just - it's not that we didn't like each other. We just didn't appreciate each other as much as we do now, and that of course got blown into proportion.'", "description": "Nina Dobrev has dismissed rumors of a continuing feud between them.
