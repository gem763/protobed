He said: 'I'm not coming back anymore because I can't really physically work.'\n\n'He said he would come back to England and Manchester if he had a chance and maybe he would come back to the business. I said: \"Yes no problem\".\n\n'Then in January this year he called me from Italy and said: \"I'm coming back.\" He said he wanted to buy back the business but when he came over he said: \"I can't do it alone - can you help me.\" I said: \"I'm happy to help you.\"\n\n'At the time I needed some help myself as my daughter had split up with boyfriend but after two or three days Bruno came back and said: \"I can't anymore I have to go back to Italy\". I said: \"I'm happy to help you if you want it no problem.\"\n\n'He had been in the restaurant helping me to serve and that is the last time I saw him. To me he was down but not \"down, down\".\n\nMr Pollutri (pictured with a staff member at his eatery) hanged himself in a children's play area\n\n'Every time he would just say: \"Thank you very much for understanding me and everything, if I was another person maybe they wouldn't understand.\"'\n\nMr Pollutri's brother, Giafranco Pollutri, said in a statement: 'We felt he had a new start in life in England and reinvented himself but he had a heart attack and further heart problems and moved back to Italy in 2018.\n\n'We found him a house but here were not many jobs there and it was more difficult because of his health. He was fed up and he felt guilty that he couldn't work, because of his health. Things were difficult but there was nothing to indicate things might be worse.\n\nThe chef is pictured at work in his restaurant, where he loved to serve Manchester City's supporters\n\n'He didn't express any suicidal intention before but it seems his health problems and inability to work have caused him to become so depressed he took his own life. We have not told our mother how he died.'\n\nA GP's report said: 'He came to see the doctor on 23rd January 2019 because he was suffering problem with his memory. he said he tended to forget things short-term but would remember what happened long term. He had also been to see a neurologist in Italy and some tests were made.'\n\nA report by a police coroners' officer said: 'There was no note - the only thing of relevance that we found was on his phone which was examined. Searches in relation to suicide and how to commit suicide from November 2018 up to January 2019, ways to commit suicide, euthanasia and where euthanasia is practiced in Europe.\n\n'When we took statements, it did become clear that due to his health problems he had become quite depressed. He had been a restauranteur but he may have thought he was having to cut down on working because of his health.'\n\nRecording a conclusion of suicide Assistant Coroner Angharad Davies said: 'Born in Italy as a member of a large family he came to the UK in 2008, he settled in the Stockport area and went into business. It was going successfully when he suffered a number of health problems, he had a heart attack in 2017 he had further heart problems in 2017 and had a stroke in 2018.\n\n'From the evidence it seems to me that this was undoubtedly affecting Mr Pollutri and his ability to work, it was affecting him because he felt he couldn't work as hard as he did before and felt bad about that.\n\n'In January 2019 he went to his GP for the first time with concerns about memory disturbance which might have been related to his stroke, he was saying this was affecting his ability to work. His death seems to have come as a surprise to everybody but he had been researching suicide and it is quite clear to me that this I something he had been considering for a number of months.'\n\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.", "description": "Bruno Pollutri (pictured) suffered a stroke that stopped him being able to serve Manchester City supporters at his popular restaurant close to the team's Etihad stadium.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/10/20173350-0-image-a-71_1571996204593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
