Asked on Wednesday on whether he would meet Rouhani, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do believe they\u2019d like to make a deal,\u201d the president said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump criticised Bolton for his positions on a range of foreign policy issues, stretching back to his role in advocating the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\n\u201cHe made some very big mistakes,\u201d the president said. \u201cJohn is known as a tough guy. He\u2019s so tough, he got us into Iraq.\u201d\n\nBolton had been \u201cway out of line\u201d on Venezuela policy and was \u201cnot getting along with people\u201d in the administration, Trump added.\n\nBolton\u2019s departure from the White House is widely seen in Washington as clearing the way for a more conciliatory foreign policy towards US adversaries in the run-up to next year\u2019s elections, as the president seeks to launch his campaign looking more like a dealmaker than a warmonger.\n\nSecuring a meeting with Rouhani at the UN general assembly is likely to be challenging without significant sanctions relief, a U-turn from the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy. The Iranian president\u2019s options are limited by domestic politics and the views of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, who has thus far been adamant in his rejection of a return to talks.\n\nForeign policy analysts suggested that to score a quick foreign policy win \u2013 or at least the appearance of one \u2013 getting nuclear talks with North Korea back on track looks an easier hill to climb. Pyongyang has said it is prepared to restart discussions later this month, although the regime followed the offer with two short-range missile tests and a warning that the US would have to change its negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWith Trump flailing around and looking for a Kodak moment, to my mind North Korea seems more ripe than Iran,\u201d said Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council. \u201cThe Iranians must be smelling weakness now, with Trump looking for his fourth national security adviser. Now is not the time to go easy on him.\u201d\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s 'maximum pressure' foreign policy yields minimum results Read more\n\nTrump acknowledged on Wednesday that Bolton\u2019s presence was an obstacle to negotiating with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, after the former adviser suggested the \u201cLibyan model\u201d of disarmament for Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cTake a look at what happened to Gaddafi\u2026 and he\u2019s using that to make a deal with North Korea?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Kim Jong-un for what he said after that. He wanted nothing to do with John Bolton. That\u2019s not a question of being tough; that\u2019s a question of being not smart.\u201d\n\nSuzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who has been involved in back-channel negotiations with both Tehran and Pyongyang, said: \u201cBolton\u2019s removal provides an opportunity for the Trump administration to reassess its failed \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 approach to both Iran and North Korea.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cMuch would depend on whether Trump has the capacity to empower seasoned diplomats to carry out real diplomacy on both fronts.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Macron has being trying to orchestrate a Trump-Rouhani meeting at the UN general assembly, and Trump appeared to be open to the idea at the G7 summit last month in Biarritz..\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In this 21 July photo, a Revolutionary Guard speedboat circles the oil tanker Stena Impero.

Photograph: Morteza Akhoondi/AP\n\nRouhani\u2019s office said on Wednesday the Iranian president had talked by phone to Macron, and told him: \u201cFrom the point of view of the Iranian government, parliament and people, negotiating with the US under sanctions is pointless.\u201d\n\nAriane Tabatabai, a political scientist and Iran expert at the Rand Corporation, said that Iran was amassing bargaining chips in anticipation of an eventual return to talks with the US.\n\nThree Australians, two of them dual British citizens, held in Iran Read more\n\nOne by one, Tehran has ceased observing the limits on its nuclear programme imposed in the 2015 deal: it has harassed oil shipping going through the strait of Hormuz, seizing a British tanker, the Stena Impero, and it has stepped up arbitrary arrests of westerners visiting Iran, including two British-Australian dual nationals and a third Australian.\n\n\u201cWhat I think they are actually pursuing is more leverage than anything else,\u201d Tabatabai said. \u201cA lot of their activities currently are just them trying to build this pressure campaign of their own, so that they can come back to the table with more chips, so that the US does not go straight for their red lines.\u201d\n\nRouhani\u2019s decision on whether to meet Trump at the UN will be influenced by the degree to which the US eases the oil and banking embargo on Iran, but also by the dynamics of Iranian politics.\n\n\u201cRouhani has an opportunity here. There\u2019s an American president who is desperate for something that looks remotely like a foreign policy success,\u201d said Alex Vatanka, an Iran expert at the Middle East Institute. But he added that Rouhani would not meet Trump without the approval of Iran\u2019s ageing supreme leader. Khamenei was furious with the president for even taking a phone call from Obama at the UN general assembly six years ago.\n\n\u201cI think the supreme leader is thinking in terms of succession, and passing the baton on to someone that he would like, and not doing anything to empower Rouhani.\u201d\n\nTrump has options too, when it comes to diplomatic breakthroughs. One is a return to a partial nuclear deal with North Korea, which was under discussion before Trump\u2019s second summit with Kim Jong-un in Vietnam in February.\n\nAt that meeting, Trump switched to a harder-line position advocated by Bolton that North Korea disarm completely in return for full sanctions relief.\n\nVictor Cha, former director of Asian affairs at the national security council, said Trump could decide to accept a North Korean offer of dismantling a handful of sites, including parts of the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, in return for partial sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cIt would certainly be lower-hanging fruit than Iran,\u201d Cha, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThere is already stuff on the table and with Bolton gone, there is nothing stop him.\u201d", "description": "Former national security adviser John Bolton opposed idea of easing sanctions but Trump says: \u2018I do believe they\u2019d like to make a deal\u2019", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa8885f3873a1ab7d3345bd7795eed10cc34bdf3/0_51_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84fdcaba3e87fa053f7cfc813425ebd3", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
