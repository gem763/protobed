The sheik warned on a visit to Washington this week that the U.S. cannot afford to ease up on the long-term battle against Islamic extremist ideology.\n\n\u201cIf we believe the killing of Baghdadi is the end of ISIS, we are wrong,\u201d said Sheik Issa, who has sought to position the Mecca-based World Muslim League as the leading opponent of extremist Islamic teachings since taking the helm of the organization in 2016.\n\n\u201cBaghdadi\u2019s death is a huge loss for ISIS and an historical event for the United States and its endeavors in counterterrorism,\u201d the sheik told The Washington Times. \u201cBut we now must be careful in our future steps in countering terrorism, because the risk now is that ISIS will intensify its ideological efforts to target the youth and recruit them \u2014 specifically youths who are deprived of any true religious teachings.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a sobering message that came in a wide-ranging interview just days after President Trump announced the U.S. Special Forces raid that resulted in the Islamic State founder and leader\u2019s death, a development that has triggered debate over whether victory over the group known in counterterrorism circles as \u201cDaesh\u201d should be publicly declared.\n\nWith Pentagon officials warning this week that the fight is far from over, Sheikh Issa suggested that a more profound, likely decades-long battle against ISIS and other radical Islamist movements has only just begun.\n\n\u2018Biggest threat to Islam\u2019\n\nThe deeper ideological fight has been sidetracked in recent years by military-focused campaigns Islamic State\u2019s once-extensive \u201ccaliphate,\u201d said Sheikh Issa, who argues that the stakes in the battle against Islamic State\u2019s extremist ideology are as high today as ever.\n\n\u201cDaesh has nothing to do with Islam. Daesh is against Islam. Daesh has distorted Islam. Daesh tried to hijack Islam. We as Muslims see it as an obligation to combat Daesh. We must eliminate it completely,\u201d Sheik Issa told The Times. \u201cThis is the biggest threat to the reputation of Islam right now. We at the Muslim World League consider Daesh to be a terrorist organization, trying to combat true Islam.\u201d\n\nIt may have lost its territorial \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria and Iraq, but the terror group\u2019s ability to recruit and propagandize online remains intact, he said, noting that such efforts are \u201cnot held by any geographical boundaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States has, without a doubt, played a very big role and made a great contribution to the virtual side of combatting extremism,\u201d Sheikh Issa said. \u201cThe U.S. is actually doing this right now, shutting down thousands of terrorist websites and this should continue.\u201d\n\nHe sees the challenge moving forward as how to overcome the appeal of radical Islamist ideas to thousands of impressionable, often marginalized young people in the greater Muslim world.\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s success, he said, depended on the attractiveness of its propaganda sophistication on social media, while more moderate Islamic voices have not been effectively promoted or resonated with the same force in the post-9/11 era.\n\n\u201cHave there been any religious efforts to counter the ISIS propaganda online that are truly in proportion to the ISIS propaganda efforts?\u201d the sheikh asked. \u201cIn the past years there have not, although recently, such efforts have started.\u201d\n\n\u201cEducation plays a big role,\u201d he said. \u201cReligious guidance also has a big role.\u201d\n\nFuture U.S. role\n\nThe U.S. should back moderate Islamic organizations in combating extremism through the very counterterrorism alliances that successive administrations have already established in the Middle East, Sheikh Issa said, including more overt American support for groups like the World Muslim League.\n\n\u201cThere should be a high-level meeting that should evaluate the requirements for this next period of this war,\u201d the sheikh said. \u201cThere needs to be a stronger understanding of what support and what cooperation is needed.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will heed that call, but Sheikh Issa insists he is optimistic.\n\n\u201cThe United States has built the coalition against ISIS,\u201d he said, citing President Trump\u2019s participation in a 2017 ceremony in Riyadh for the inauguration of the Etidal Global Center for Combatting Extremist Ideology in the Saudi capital.\n\nSheikh Issa also offered guarded praise for the Obama administration, which in 2015 backed the establishment of a joint U.S.-United Arab Emirates operation known as the Sawab Center \u2014 a social media communications hub aimed at undermining extremist recruiting propaganda through \u201cdirect engagements\u201d online.\n\nU.S. officials have described the center in Abu Dhabi as a place where moderate Muslims wage online information warfare against extremism, establishing deep contacts with Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies to identify and scrub jihadi propaganda from the internet.\n\nSheikh Issa described such efforts as \u201cconstructive,\u201d but stressed that the matter of counter-messaging against Islamic extremism \u201cis a very sensitive thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIslam should only be explained to Muslims by other Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Muslim world cannot accept from others around the world to explain their religion to them.\u201d\n\nBuilding bridges\n\nCritics have said Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, including critical comments on Islamic extremism and an administration travel ban that largely targeted Muslim-majority nations. But Sheikh Issa said in the interview that the president\u2019s unorthodox rhetoric should not be seen as hostile to Islam.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump never says he is against Islam,\u201d the sheikh said. \u201cHe says he is against extremist Islam.\u201d\n\nSheikh Issa praised the Trump administration\u2019s recent movement of U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and said he would back a rumored push by the U.S. government to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.\n\nHe claimed that the Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s government accuses rival Qatar are backing to foment unrest around the Middle East and North Africa, represents the \u201cleadership of Islamic extremism in the world.\u201d\n\nThe sheikh portrayed the World Muslim League as the polar opposite of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nWhile the League was founded by the Saudi government in the early 1960s and has been accused of promoting the Sunni kingdom\u2019s strict Wahhabi Islam, Sheikh Issa insisted the organization embraces the full range of Muslim beliefs and seeks to downplay sectarian divides \u2014 including that between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.\n\nHe also touted the league\u2019s efforts to promote peaceful coexistence between Islam and the world\u2019s other major religions, including Christianity and Judaism.\n\nSheikh Issa made headlines last year for publicly decrying anyone who blames Jews for the Holocaust, a stance he took after Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had come under international criticism for espousing such a view.\n\nIn addition to meeting with American political and religious leaders in Washington, Sheikh Issa\u2019s current visit to the United States will include a visit next week to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2014 popularly known as Mormons \u2014 in Salt Lake City.\n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to bridge the gap between cultures and civilizations and it has to be a strong bridge,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cWe are trying to take down fences and walls that are not real. The way to do that is through dialogue. Dialogue is what leads to better understanding and eventually better understanding to lead to more love and co-existence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very keen to disseminate these values and cultures among the youths,\u201d he added. \u201cDifferences and diversity are a very normal thing and should not lead to hatred or clashes among people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have made a lot of progress but we are still at the beginning of the road with this mission.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
