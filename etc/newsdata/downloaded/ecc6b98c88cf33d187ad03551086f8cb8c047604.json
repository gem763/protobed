Normally, you\u2019re checking in the hope of finding nothing new so you can be sure no one else has spent your money. However, when Twitter user Tim Cameron did that earlier this week, not only did he find four new transactions, but he also found that they contained the key to him finding his lost wallet.\n\nThe four transactions were each for a single penny, transferred into his account by a mysterious \u201cSimon.\u201d However, what was interesting was the text entered into the reference field of each transaction combined to spell out a short message. \u201cHi, I found your \u2026 wallet in the road,\u201d the first two transactions read, before including a phone number that Cameron could contact to retrieve his wallet.\n\nI just lost my wallet on the way home from work. I didn't have much identifying info in there so a good Samaritan got in touch with my via my... bank account\n\n\n\n4x transfers of \u00a30.01 each with a reference up to 18 chars pic.twitter.com/RVK8I1ZctQ \u2014 Tim Cameron (@Timcammm) October 14, 2019\n\nSpeaking to the Evening Standard, Cameron said that he called the number and was able to pick up the lost wallet. Although he said he\u2019d bought a bottle of wine for Simon, Cameron admitted that he hadn\u2019t paid him back the \u00a30.04 that he definitely owes him. Let\u2019s hope it was a nice bottle at least.", "description": "One Twitter user has shared a story of how they retrieved their lost wallet after someone used a series of transactions to send them a short message. \"Hi, I found your ... wallet in the road\" the message read, before giving him a number to call.", "authors": ["Jon Porter", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ijeO_AHml-gtHi1iE71WCR3kxg=/0x566:5000x3184/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19288733/1156956588.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
