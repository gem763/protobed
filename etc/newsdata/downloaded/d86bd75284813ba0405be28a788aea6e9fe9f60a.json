That would involve applying different border rules to Northern Ireland from the rest of the country to help keep goods flowing across the Irish border.\n\nBut Johnson told his Northern Ireland allies that he was opposed to the idea of a Northern Ireland-only backstop, DUP leader Arlene Foster said this week.", "description": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has agreed to accept Northern Ireland abiding by some European Union rules after Brexit as part of a deal to replace the Irish backstop, potentially opening the door to a withdrawal agreement, The Times newspaper reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
