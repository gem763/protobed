Listings priced at a couple of grand a night are no rarity.\n\nWhen I first visited the site I misread the headline \u201cstay in one of the top 1% of homes in the world\u201d as \u201cstay in the homes of the 1%\u201d - a reference to the top percentile of the world\u2019s wealthy - but it did not matter because the message is broadly the same.\n\nFounded in London in 2015, the Plum Guide has set out to carefully curate an Airbnb for the rich and richer, putting each potential property through a 150-point test then rejecting 99 out of every 100.\n\nIt has since expanded to 11 more cities, including Milan, Berlin and Paris as well as the aforementioned, and has 6,000 homes on its books, though maintains its standards have stayed as rigorous.\n\nThe living room of the Bengal Tiger, London Credit: plum guide More\n\nThere is no doubting the luxury (or at least expense) of its top-end properties: glancing at London\u2019s dearest options, there were four that cost more than \u00a35,000 a night. But many of the homes can be found on other booking sites, too, from Airbnb to Booking.com.\n\nWhere the Plum Guide tries to differentiate itself is in its assessment process, sending a \u201cHome Critic\u201d to every place it offers, and publicising no user reviews. According to the firm\u2019s literature, it refers to its in-house testing method as \u201cthe science and art behind the perfect stay\u201d and asks its reviewers to score the home on 150 criteria during a two hour trial, from showerhead pressure and natural light to WiFi strength and ambient noise. It also, like Airbnb, details the draws of the local neighbourhood, and distances to key tourist attractions.\n\nOn its listing it then sums up the results, as well as mentioning the cons. In New York, a \u00a32,522 per night duplex on the Upper East Side \u201cis a little dark\u201d and the \u201cbathroom and kitchen could do with an upgrade\u201d. At a \u00a32,374 per night flat in Tel Aviv the downstairs living room doesn\u2019t have any windows, while there was some construction noise on a nearby street. A \u00a31,087 per night two-bed in Rome doesn\u2019t come with many ingredients \u201cdespite there being two kitchens\u201d.\n\nOne of the Plum Guide's top properties in Paris, 'Rue de Varenne III' Credit: plum guide More\n\nStory continues", "description": "Where Airbnb challenges travellers to live as locals do, the Plum Guide implores you to live as the other half does.", "authors": ["Hugh Morris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2tJwHB_pFc8kPr2JYcYsPg--~B/aD0xMTE3O3c9MTc4NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/16517a3e9bcb3bef6499c362877fdc7d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
