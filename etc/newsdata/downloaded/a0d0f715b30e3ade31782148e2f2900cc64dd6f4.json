At that time, nobody spoke about breast cancer.'\n\nThe Austin Powers star previously revealed her relative showed her scars from a double mastectomy once she finally told her family about her diagnosis, but would often change the subject.\n\nWow: The actress looked glamorous as she arrived at the event in a belted hot pink dress as she continues to raise awareness for the devastating disease\n\nReflecting on when breast cancer was a taboo subject, the Royals actress explained: 'When I started working for the breast cancer campaign, my grandmother had just died.\n\n'When I was told it was started because women were dying, it really rang home for me, because she didn\u2019t talk about it. There was no awareness, no pink ribbon campaign.'\n\nDuring her work as a global ambassador for the Estee Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign, Liz has insisted she's witnessed 'great changes' in research and attitudes towards the disease.\n\nThe media personality urged: 'People aren\u2019t checking their own breasts. If you\u2019re too young to have a mammogram, which is under 50 or in some countries under 40, you have to check your breasts. We\u2019re raising awareness but we\u2019re raising funds too.\n\nOne in eight women will develop breast cancer at some point in their life. However, those who have already had the disease have double the risk of developing a new cancer in another area of the same breast, or in the other breast.\n\nGenetics are thought to be the reason - but in the majority of cases, the exact genes responsible have not yet been discovered.\n\nLast week, the film star took to Instagram to share a poignant message about the disease.\n\nShe penned on her platform: 'Every 15 seconds, somewhere in the world, a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. In one way or another, we\u2019re all drawn together by this disease.\n\n'Grab your favourite pink lipstick and help us fund life-saving research. Draw a pink ribbon on your hand, post a photo, and share why it\u2019s #TimeToEndBreastCancer.'", "description": "Elizabeth Hurley was putting on a brave face on Tuesday when she stepped off at the collaboration of OKA and Ron Arad at the OKA Chelsea store in London.", "authors": ["Kate Thomas For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19462732-0-image-a-33_1570568957470.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
