Sign up here.\n\nOne of Betsy DeVos\u2019 top brass is quitting his job at the Department of Education \u2014 and took the time to warn everyone that many of the 45 million Americans who owe a collective $1.5 trillion in college loans will realistically never pay the federal government back.\n\nIn fact, he thinks the U.S. should just cancel their debt.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for us to end and stop the insanity,\u201d A. Wayne Johnson, chief strategy and transformation officer at the Department of Education, told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nJohnson, who announced he\u2019ll resign Thursday, has been with the Trump administration since 2017 and had previously served as chief operating officer of student aid under DeVos, according to the Wall Street Journal. But his new plan doesn\u2019t exactly jibe with the Department of Education\u2019s current stance on student loan debt \u2014 it\u2019s more in line with, say, progressive Democrats like Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nHis hope is to forgive up to $50,000 in federal student debt for borrowers, regardless of their income. That\u2019s even more sweeping than Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s current student debt platform since she has a cap on full benefits for people earning more than $100,000. (Johnson\u2019s plan is closer to Sen. Sanders\u2019 2020 debt platform, since Sanders plainly wants to get rid of all federal student loan debt.)\n\nREAD: Robert Smith's gift to Moorehouse College left this student behind: 'We shouldn't have billionaires'\n\nNearly 40% of borrowers are expected to default on their student loans by 2023, according to a 2018 report from the Brookings Institute. Johnson\u2019s plan would help about 37 million borrowers, he said. For those who have already repaid student debt, he\u2019s interested in a tax credit of up to $50,000, paid for with a 1% tax on corporate earnings.\n\n\u201cWe run through the process of putting this debt burden on somebody \u2026 but it rides on their credit files \u2014 it rides on their back \u2014 for decades,\u201d Johnson, who wrote his dissertation on student debt, told the Journal.\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s plan is far from what his former boss stood for. Education Secretary DeVos told Fox News on Friday that similar Democratic proposals to cancel student debt are \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Who do they think is actually going to pay for these? It's going to be two of the three Americans that aren't going to college paying for the one out of three that do,\" DeVos said. \"Let's look at this for what it really is: A federal takeover of higher education.\"\n\nJohnson now plans to run on the 2020 Republican ticket for a Senate seat in Georgia, where he can pitch student debt cancellation to Congress. Before that, he hopes Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will appoint him to to the interim position created by Sen. Johnny Isakson\u2019s impending retirement.\n\nMore than 500 people have applied for the governor\u2019s appointment, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nCover image: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos speaks during a school choice event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, May 3, 2017.
