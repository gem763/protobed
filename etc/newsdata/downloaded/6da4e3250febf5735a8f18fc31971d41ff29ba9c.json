The scattering happens when the diameter of the particles is similar to the wavelength of visible sunlight, the agency said.", "description": "The skies over the Indonesian province of Jambi have been turned blood red, as the toxic haze from widespread rainforest fires continues to affect residents across the country.", "authors": ["Eric Cheung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190924145354-indonesia-red-planet-haze-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
