The central bank, which has left interest rates on hold this year even as some of its major peers have eased, is due to make its next rate decision on Oct. 30.\n\nAt 4:23 p.m. (2023 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.3200 to the greenback, or 75.76 U.S. cents.\n\nThe currency, which last Friday notched a one-month high at 1.3171 after data showing a much bigger-than-expected domestic jobs gain, traded in a range of 1.3196 to 1.3238.\n\nOil prices fell as investors worried that the unrelenting U.S.-China trade war would keep squeezing the global economy, and that swelling inventories would further pressure prices. U.S. crude oil futures settled 1.5% lower at $52.81 a barrel.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3%, its lowest level since the global financial crisis, but its projection for Canada was unchanged from its previous forecast in July at 1.5%.\n\nCanadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year ( ) down 7 Canadian cents to yield 1.693% and the 10-year ( ) falling 40 Canadian cents to yield 1.562%.\n\nThe 10-year yield touched its highest intraday level since July 17 at 1.577%.", "description": "Loonie gets tailwind from rising Brexit deal hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E1WM-OCABS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
