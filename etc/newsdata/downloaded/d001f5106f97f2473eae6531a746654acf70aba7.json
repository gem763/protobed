He also noted that alternative suggestions exist for how to give Irish institutions a say on what happens in future.\n\nAccording to one diplomat the Sunday\u2019s extraordinary meeting is already in the agenda.\n\nThe diplomats also cautioned that there was fear in Brussels that London might be bluffing.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to a Brexit deal is the EU insistence that Northern Ireland remain in the EU customs zone and London\u2019s insistence that the entire U.K. form its own, new customs regime. Trade experts say a compromise would require a highly creative alternative. \u201cThe question is, is there a third way?\u201d one of the diplomats asked.\n\nEU diplomats remain very cautious although they say that at any time next week, or even on Sunday, there could be an extraordinary meeting of EU27 ambassadors to discuss the outcome of talks. According to one diplomat the Sunday\u2019s extraordinary meeting is already in the agenda.\n\nSecretary General of the Council of the EU Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen noted in the meeting of ambassadors that any agreement would need to be finalized by Tuesday's General Affairs Council meeting of EU ministers because member states did not want to enter into negotiations at next week's summit.\n\nIf no new version of the deal is agreed in time, then the progress in recent days could give the EU reason to extend negotiations but only if talks sound very promising, one of the diplomats said. Although another diplomat stressed that London is insisting it will leave on October 31st.\n\nFor now, Brussels remains cautious, something reflected by the refusal to use the expression \u201cbeing back in the tunnel\u201d for the last days of talks, the jargon for when negotiators focus on the legal text line-by-line under conditions of secrecy and a phrase that in the past has signaled a deal was close. \u201cI don't like to talk about tunnel, I talk about negotiations,\u201d said a senior diplomat. Barnier never used this expression in talks with ambassadors Friday, one of the diplomats said.\n\nThe atmosphere is \u201cof a very cautious optimism\u201d said one of the diplomats.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
