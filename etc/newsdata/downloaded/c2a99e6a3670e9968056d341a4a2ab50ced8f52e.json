The 49-year-old former MYOB chief executive Tim Reed represents more than generational change. Mr Reed\u2019s background in small business software means he\u2019s not the boss from the big end of town that politicians \u2013 both Coalition and Labor \u2013 cast as the villain of the piece. He\u2019s not a banker, a miner, a gas exporter or a big energy CEO. His background in using practical technology to help Scott Morrison\u2019s quiet Australians have a go is an opportunity to reset the business community's fractious relationship with the government. What corporate Australia needs now is an articulate and energetic advocate like Mr Reed who can make the public case for big structural reforms in tax, energy, and workplace policy that are urgently needed to boost investment, jobs, productivity and economic growth.\n\nHe's not the boss from the big end of town.
