What\u2019s to worry?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it: For most of us, the federal debt is somewhere between a snoozer and an abstraction,\u201d David Davenport, a federal policy analyst at the Hoover Institution, wrote last year in Forbes Magazine.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty more tangible and immediate problems to worry about. Even if we did get stirred up about it, what can we do?\u201d he wrote.\n\nThen CBO released its annual Budget and Economic Outlook in 2019 about the financial ill health of the federal government, and it\u2019s not a pretty picture. It forecasts:\n\n\u2022 \u201cDebt held by the public will increase by more than $12.5 trillion under current law over the next decade \u2014 from $16.1 trillion today to $28.7 trillion by 2029.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cDebt as a share of the economy will rise rapidly, from today\u2019s post-war record of 78 percent of GDP to nearly 93 percent of GDP by 2029.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder current law, CBO projects [budget] deficits will grow from $779 billion last year to $897 billion in 2019,\u201d and to an estimated $1 trillion or more by 2020.\n\n\u201cOn a basic level, this means the U.S. government is spending way more money than it brings in,\u201d writes economics reporter Heather Long of The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been running a deficit every year since 2002, but the situation is about to get really ugly,\u201d she says \u2026 If spending keeps up at this pace (and there is every indication that it will), President Trump and his successors are going to have less flexibility to pump up the economy during a downturn or even a crisis.\u201d\n\nIn his Forbes article \u201cFive Reasons Why You Should Worry About The Federal Debt\u201d, Mr. Davenport writes that \u201cyour Social Security and Medicare entitlements are at risk if the federal debt continues to grow \u2026 Since it will be almost impossible to cut federal spending and the national debt without touching expensive entitlements, your entitlements \u2014 especially if you are younger than the Baby Boomers \u2014 are very much at risk.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he argues, \u201cthe growing debt increases the risk to our national defense,\u201d recalling how National Intelligence Director Dan Coats scolded senators at a hearing, saying that uncontrolled federal spending \u201cis threatening our ability to properly defend our nation, both in the short term and especially in the long term.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump promised in his campaign to balance the federal budget, but has failed to honor that pledge, Mr. Davenport points out. He quotes the president\u2019s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin who said government spending is \u201cnot an issue we\u2019re focused on right now.\u201d\n\nMr. Davenport says that every American should be very concerned about out of control federal spending because the politicians in Congress and in the executive branch are spending like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\n\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re too young to worry about the federal debt, you\u2019re precisely the one who should be worried,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cAs President Herbert Hoover wisely said, \u2018Blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
