This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d Today: When John Steffen died, his family had little doubt that a lifetime of cigarette smoking was to blame. Then, the Nebraska Department of Health got an unusual tip. Part 1 of a two-part series on the promise and the peril of vaping. It\u2019s Monday, October 28.\n\nkathleen fimple You will see the animals on the wall. So, there\u2019s a rainbow trout and an antelope and a deer above the fireplace. So, yeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJulie, tell me about this trip you took to Nebraska.\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo, a couple of weeks ago, I went to Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJulie Bosman is a national reporter at The Times.\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd I went to the home of Kathleen Fimple \u2014\n\nkathleen fimple You guys can sit \u2014\n\njulie bosman\n\n\u2014 where she lives with her dog, Bo, a little terrier. And Kathleen showed me around her house.\n\nkathleen fimple That room\u2019s a mess, but we could pull some things off \u2014\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd I sat down with Kathleen and her daughter, Dulcia, and her granddaughter, and they showed me something that Dulcia had made after the death of her father, John Steffen.\n\nkathleen fimple My daughter made this.\n\njulie bosman\n\nIt was a glass box.\n\nkathleen fimple That\u2019s what we used for the funeral.\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd inside were mementos that represented his life.\n\nkathleen fimple He played guitar, so we\u2019ve got guitar picks, and \u201cGrandma\u2019s Feather Bed\u201d was a song we all liked to sing together.\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo John was a very active outdoorsman. There was a turkey feather from one of his hunting expeditions.\n\nkathleen fimple There\u2019s a shotgun shell, there\u2019s the antler \u2014 this knife has an antler.\n\njulie bosman\n\nThere were badges and pins.\n\nkathleen fimple He was a Scout leader.\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd there were dried flowers from his funeral spray.\n\nkathleen fimple Those were from the casket spray.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how exactly did he die?\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo, John died after a long illness.\n\nkathleen fimple He was a lifelong smoker. julie bosman What did he smoke? kathleen fimple Marlboros. julie bosman Not the lights, the \u2014 kathleen fimple Oh, no. No, no.\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo he started smoking back in the \u201860s when he was a teenager, and it was a habit that he really stuck with for most of his life.\n\njulie bosman How did he feel about his smoking? Was he like, \u201cUgh, I hate this,\u201d or, \u201cI love it, and I don\u2019t want to quit.\u201d Or how \u2014 kathleen fimple I love it, and I don\u2019t want to quit. And also, a lot of denial, especially early on. My grandpa lived to be, whatever, 80-something, and he smoked.\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo he was kind of clinging to the idea that smoking wasn\u2019t bad.\n\nkathleen fimple Eventually, I think he reconciled that, yes, smoking was bad, and it could cause cancer.\n\njulie bosman\n\nHe tried very, very hard to quit.\n\nkathleen fimple In his 30s, while we were first married, he quit several times briefly.\n\njulie bosman\n\nSometimes he would be successful, and then he started up again.\n\nkathleen fimple He\u2019d stop for a month or two, and then, yeah.\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd his daughter, when she had her own baby daughter, she would take little pictures of the baby and tuck them into his packs of cigarettes.\n\ndulcia steffen So that he would see her face every time he pulled out a cigarette. I was like, O.K., I\u2019ve tried all the little tactics.\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo, she tried everything she could, but his addiction to nicotine was decades strong.\n\n[music]\n\njulie bosman\n\nBut then he developed C.O.P.D., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is a very common disease that many smokers develop. And in his case, it gave him a very bad cough, and it made it difficult to breathe at times.\n\nkathleen fimple We\u2019d go to church, and he sing a line, and then he\u2019d stop, and then he\u2019d have to pick it up later because he\u2019d have to catch his breath in between. And he used to whistle all the time \u2014 he couldn\u2019t whistle anymore.\n\njulie bosman\n\nHe had atrial fibrillation, and sometime later, he got non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and had to have chemotherapy for years.\n\nkathleen fimple I think that was when he started vaping. julie bosman Do you know how he got the idea? kathleen fimple No. We both, I had kind of seen advertisements for it and things, but it was his idea, and he bought one and came home with it.\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo, John started vaping about five years ago.\n\njulie bosman Do you know which brand? kathleen fimple Mistics. dulcia steffen Then he had blu, and then he went to Juul. kathleen fimple And he only went to Juul less than a year ago.\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd he had heard about vaping as the cleaner, healthier alternative to cigarettes. So he became just as enthusiastic of a vaper as he was a smoker. So, earlier this year \u2014\n\nkathleen fimple There was a cough, cold going around \u2014\n\njulie bosman\n\nIt was a cold winter, and everybody had a cold, and a cough. And John kind of got it the worst.\n\nkathleen fimple And it probably, in some ways, was less obvious to us because he had a smoker\u2019s cough. So he coughed, but it was also obvious that this was worse.\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd his daughter, Dulcia, started nagging at him, and saying, Dad, you really need to go to the doctor.\n\nkathleen fimple That\u2019s probably why he went, though, in April, just because you kept pushing him. dulcia steffen Yeah.\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo he did, and he was diagnosed with pneumonia.\n\nkathleen fimple Dr. Simon said, \u201cYou have pneumonia, and you\u2019re going to the hospital.\u201d\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd he was in the hospital for a week. And seven, eight days into his hospital stay \u2014\n\ndulcia steffen His hands were like ice. kathleen fimple They were starting to turn blue. dulcia steffen He couldn\u2019t blink, and his mouth was propped open, and he wasn\u2019t breathing very often. And his last breath I could tell because there was just a slight twitch in his neck.\n\njulie bosman\n\nHe died of acute respiratory failure, which the doctor said was a consequence of the C.O.P.D.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo essentially, he died of smoking, or smoking-related lung disease, it sounds like.\n\njulie bosman\n\nYes. His wife said that he always believed that he was going to die of lung cancer. So when the doctors said that he had died, essentially, as a consequence of C.O.P.D., they had no reason to question the doctor\u2019s conclusion.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd as tragic as that is, it all kind of lines up with our understanding of what a lifetime of smoking does to a person.\n\njulie bosman\n\nRight. But then four months after John died, Kathleen was sitting at work one day.\n\nkathleen fimple I was in a meeting when the Department of Health called.\n\njulie bosman\n\nShe got a phone call from an investigator at the Nebraska Department of Health, and he asked her all kinds of questions.\n\nkathleen fimple He asked about any exposure in the past to moldy wood, or wood chips, to asbestos, to pesticides. Then they asked about symptoms.\n\njulie bosman\n\nHe asked if he had had any kind of vomiting before his death.\n\nkathleen fimple Did he lose weight, was he coughing?\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd he also asked her about vaping.\n\nkathleen fimple I said, I don\u2019t know why vaping \u2014 I mean, yes, he vaped, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s from vaping. They said he had pneumonia. Lifelong smoker, C.O.P.D. \u2014\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd the investigator got off the phone with her and said he would be in touch.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Julie, what was John\u2019s relationship to vaping?\n\njulie bosman\n\nKathleen told me that when he was smoking cigarettes, he would smoke a cigarette two or three times an hour. And very quickly, he was vaping two or three times an hour.\n\ndulcia steffen It was a straight replacement for cigarettes. kathleen fimple Yeah. dulcia steffen Yeah, and part of it was habit. Years and years of habit, when you get in the vehicle, you light up a cigarette. So when he\u2019d get in the vehicle and start to drive, he would vape.\n\njulie bosman\n\nIt was a good way to help him get his nicotine fix.\n\nkathleen fimple I knew it wasn\u2019t the perfect solution, but again, figured it was better. julie bosman Right. kathleen fimple For him, and for us. julie bosman Did you ever think, could they be dangerous? kathleen fimple No. No, I \u2014 dulcia steffen You know, when they first marketed them, they said it was a safer alternative. We assumed it was healthier for those around him as well.\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd then a few days later, Kathleen spoke to the medical investigator again, and he told her that it had been confirmed. John was Nebraska\u2019s first official vaping-related death.\n\narchived recording 1 This morning, Nebraska health officials have announced the state\u2019s first vaping-related death. archived recording 2 That\u2019s right, the person was over 65, and from the Douglas County, which is the Omaha area. The individual died in May, but the State Health Department just identified it as vaping-related.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Julie, what exactly is going on here? Why is an original conclusion about John\u2019s cause of death now being re-evaluated, and, it seems, challenged? What is happening?\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo, back in May, when John died, there really was no such thing as a vaping-related death or a vaping-related illness. But throughout the summer, all these illnesses and deaths began to be reported. And all over the country, people began to look back at cases of people who had died, people who had gotten sick, and started to think a little differently about them. And in Nebraska, the State Health Department wouldn\u2019t have even looked at John\u2019s death if they hadn\u2019t received a tip.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Julie, tell me about this tip.\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo, here\u2019s what happened.\n\n[music]\n\njulie bosman\n\nJohn had an old friend who he went to high school with, and they saw each other at an alumni reunion a few years ago. They sat together with their spouses at this dinner, and throughout the dinner, as she described it, John was vaping constantly. And she had never seen anyone vape before. This was in 2014, it was kind of a new thing. And she told me that she was very alarmed by what she saw.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat exactly alarmed her?\n\njulie bosman\n\nShe was concerned because he was vaping so frequently. Of course, when you smoke, you generally have to go outside and do it. But John was vaping indoors, sitting at dinner. And she also just had this kind of gut sense that there was something kind of wrong about it. And she couldn\u2019t quite shake the feeling, even after the reunion was over and years had gone by. And she and John really didn\u2019t keep in touch, but earlier this year, when John was sick, she had heard that he was in the hospital. And then she heard that he died in May. So she waited all summer, and she started seeing things in the news about people getting sick and dying from vaping.\n\narchived recording 1 There is breaking news tonight in the nationwide vaping crisis. Another death, and new reports of possible lung disease. The C.D.C. is looking into dozens of cases. archived recording 2 The C.D.C. can confirm 31 cases \u2014 archived recording 3 200 potential cases \u2014 archived recording 4 380 cases \u2014 archived recording 5 The 450 cases span \u2014 archived recording 6 530 cases \u2014 archived recording 7 It\u2019s unclear just what\u2019s causing the problem. The C.D.C. says it will continue to investigate.\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd she told me that she kept looking in the paper, she kept looking on the news to see if John was one of those people, and that never happened. So at the end of the summer, she decided that she just couldn\u2019t get rid of this feeling that vaping was related to his death, so she called the State Health Department.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo she was the tip.\n\njulie bosman\n\nYeah, so her tip gets passed along to a medical investigator, and he was the investigator who called John\u2019s wife and spoke to her, and interviewed her about his medical history. He did a bunch of other things, too. So he spoke to the physicians who attended to John, who treated him when he was sick in the hospital in Omaha. He examined his medical records, he looked at his chest X-rays.\n\nkathleen fimple And it showed pneumonia in the lower lobe of one lung. But the rest of his lungs, both sides and upper and lower were filled with what they call ground glass opacity.\n\njulie bosman\n\nA ground glass appearance on the lungs is an injury to the lung that is typically consistent with vaping. And in some cases, it can look like there are kind of opaque white spots on the X-ray.\n\nkathleen fimple And I said, well, how does that \u2014 is that different from just a long-term smoker? And he said, yes. This is not what you would see in just, routine, if you will, long-term smoking.\n\njulie bosman\n\nAnd in this case, it was a very key piece of evidence for the investigator who was looking into John\u2019s death.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what\u2019s the understanding of how vaping might create this kind of ground glass-looking damage in the lung?\n\njulie bosman\n\nSo when you vape, of course, you use a device that heats liquid to a very high temperature, and turns it into a vapor that you inhale. Now, that liquid can contain THC, which is the ingredient in marijuana that gets you high, or it could contain nicotine. And doctors who are investigating all these illnesses and deaths don\u2019t know exactly what it is about vaping that is making people sick. But they have noticed that some of the people who have gotten sick, or died, have had the ground glass appearance on their lungs. Or in some cases, they\u2019ve had damage on their lungs that resembles a chemical burn.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJulie, my sense is that most of these vaping-related illnesses and the deaths that we have been reading about have been not from the well-known e-cigarette brands, but from basically counterfeit and bootleg products, right?\n\njulie bosman\n\nYes. So here\u2019s what we know about that. Of the people who have gotten sick or died from vaping in the last year, about three-quarters of them have vaped THC products. A little over half have vaped nicotine, and a lot of people do both, kind of toggle back and forth between vaping weed and vaping nicotine. But as best we can tell, John did not vape THC. When I asked his family, they kind of laughed at the idea that their 68-year-old husband and father would be procuring bootleg THC.\n\njulie bosman Is that unthinkable? Do you have any \u2014 I mean, is that something that he might have possibly done? kathleen fimple I don\u2019t think he would have even known where to go to get it. dulcia steffen We\u2019ve been to Colorado since it was legalized, and he wouldn\u2019t touch it. kathleen fimple He was never interested. dulcia steffen No. So I don\u2019t think he would have ever considered getting it black-market, either.\n\njulie bosman\n\nThey described his vaping habits as very aboveboard.\n\njulie bosman Do you know where he bought it? kathleen fimple Walmart. Walgreens or Walmart. julie bosman Walgreens or Walmart. kathleen fimple I don\u2019t think he bought them anyplace else. dulcia steffen He never went to any of the vape shops or anything. kathleen fimple Oh, never. Never.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, is it possible that John was vaping something like THC, but just didn\u2019t tell his family? That no one knew?\n\njulie bosman\n\nHis family very strongly discounts that possibility. He would have had to be doing it in secret, and they thought that that notion was rather ridiculous.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if he got sick from vaping, it was from regular old \u2014 I guess if the industry is old enough to call it this, but \u2014 traditional vaping?\n\njulie bosman\n\nYes. And this really only deepens the medical mystery surrounding vaping, because so many people who have gotten sick or died from vaping have been using THC vapes, and especially vaping devices or cartridges that were bought off the street, and no one really knows where they came from.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case with John.\n\njulie bosman\n\nRight.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Julie, how does John\u2019s death, as defined and diagnosed by these medical professionals, locally and nationally, how does it change our understanding of vaping and its consequences?\n\njulie bosman\n\nI think that his death raises an alarming possibility. And that is that someone who apparently did not vape THC, did not buy any kind of products on the black market, could also become very sick and die from a vaping-related illness.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And his family told you that he took up vaping, as many people do, because he thought it was actually going to make him healthier. It was going to help him quit smoking.\n\njulie bosman\n\nYeah. He thought that this would be the thing that would help him quit smoking for good, and it did. And you know, people like John Steffen are exactly the kind of person that e-cigarettes were ostensibly created for. When e-cigarettes were invented, and when companies started selling them on the mass market, they said that it was for people who wanted to quit smoking and wanted a healthier alternative. And John was exactly that person.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what\u2019s the understanding of why so many people, not just John, but hundreds of people are getting sick from this, and maybe even dying from it?\n\njulie bosman\n\nWell, I would just point to cigarette smoking and when it was first introduced. Cigarette smoking really took off during World War I among American men. And it wasn\u2019t until the 1930s when doctors began to link an increase in lung cancer rates to an increase in cigarette smoking. And it took decades after that \u2014 it wasn\u2019t until 1964 when the surgeon general released a landmark report saying, yes, smoking does cause lung cancer. So I think what a lot of doctors out there are saying is that it is far too early to know what the long-term effects of vaping might be.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn other words, the gestation period for any kind of public health problem is long, is maybe even decades.\n\njulie bosman\n\nYes. And it\u2019s very early in e-cigarettes\u2019 life. I mean, they really didn\u2019t enter the mainstream until the last 10 years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn which case, we would be at the beginning of whatever this is, not even the middle, and definitely nowhere near the end.\n\njulie bosman\n\nI think we can say for sure that the C.D.C. believes that there are many, many more cases coming, and that this is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJulie, does John\u2019s family think that he would still be alive today if he hadn\u2019t taken up vaping?\n\njulie bosman\n\nThat\u2019s a difficult question. It\u2019s something that they do think about. And when they look back on his life, they know that taking up smoking as a teenager was certainly a bad decision, and continuing to smoke all those decades was something that they wish he had not done. But they thought that he made a really good decision when he switched to vaping. They didn\u2019t worry about the health consequences of vaping. And when his daughter looked at the vaping container that was left over, sitting on the coffee table, she doesn\u2019t see something that is harmless or something that might have helped prolong his life. She sees something very dangerous.\n\ndulcia steffen To think that that box right there could be the sole reason he\u2019s dead, in some ways, is like looking at a gun with a bullet. It\u2019s just a method of death.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJulie, thank you very much.\n\njulie bosman\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Last night, the United States brought the world\u2019s number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump announced that the founder and leader of the Islamic State died during a U.S. military operation in Syria.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Capturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my administration.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi inspired thousands of men and women from across the world to join ISIS, and in 2014 created a caliphate for the terrorist group that at its height was the size of Britain and imposed a brutal form of Islam on its inhabitants.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAfter years of eluding American forces, al-Baghdadi was recently discovered in northwest Syria, where U.S. commandos chased him into a tunnel. There, he detonated a suicide vest that killed himself and three of his young children.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) He was a sick and depraved man, and now he\u2019s gone.\n\nmichael barbaro", "description": "How one man\u2019s death is changing our understanding of vaping and its consequences.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/us/00vaping-victim-family-DAILY/00vaping-victim-family-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
