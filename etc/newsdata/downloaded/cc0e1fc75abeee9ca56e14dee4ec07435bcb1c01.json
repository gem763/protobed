It will hear evidence for three days before making a ruling.", "description": "The UK's highest court will on Tuesday start hearing evidence to decide if Boris Johnson's decision to shut down parliament was against the law.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d76998d2e22af5fad72f144-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
