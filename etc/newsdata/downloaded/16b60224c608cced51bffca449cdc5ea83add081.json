Why food critics go too far", "language": "en", "text": "I was a restaurant reviewer for 10 years, and then I was let go, as they say. I expected to be distraught because I would miss the money, and also the food. Instead, it was an incredible relief. Reviewing food is fine when you hate a lot of things; it is fine when you stand ready and willing to do an elaborate and caustic hit job on an orange sorbet because you have been either absolutely loving or completely hating relatively benign things since you could talk. It is fine when you have quite a dedicated moral architecture of taste, when you admire good food so much that you can summon real dismay at even its very slight inferior. The problem is not that you run out of words for the best of it, nor that you take no demonic enjoyment from having unearthed the worst.\n\nThe problem is the sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of food that is just tasty. It\u2019s not an angel dancing on your tongue; it didn\u2019t crack open your understanding of what a vegetable should be, or its meaning in the universe; it wasn\u2019t like an explosion, or an epiphany; it didn\u2019t have the deep, resonating familiarity that brought you so close to the quiddity of a steak that you felt as if you could speak cow just by eating it. It\u2019s just tasty \u2013 or quite tasty.\n\nFood critics hate the word \u201ctasty\u201d the way theatre critics hate the word \u201cmoving\u201d. Of course it\u2019s moving \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s there for. Moving how? And I can see their point, but what if it is just tasty? I know the answer, by the way; if it\u2019s no better than that, you just have to work harder at hating it. The whole enterprise must be envisaged by your most histrionic tendencies as a banjo duel between you and the chef: she is trying to find nine ways to reinvent an onion, you are trying to find nine words to describe it. But what kind of a monster, handed a perfectly tasty plate of pasta, with a bit of chilli and some bouncy, tasty olives, could hate it? It\u2019s just so tasty!\n\nCookbook writers are off that hook. They are not required to rhapsodise about how delicious anything will be \u2013 that would be boastful. But they are in the unenviable position of having to mythologise the ingredients. Beans are always humble, cabbage and parsnips always earthy. The animal kingdom is always magnificent, but they can\u2019t overdo its majesty in case people feel bad that it is no longer alive. How are they so readable, with so many constraints? Because the best of them are like short stories \u2013 over in a flash, tantalisingly low on detail, peculiarly evocative \u2013 like Victorian erotica, mainly gripping because you can\u2019t actually see anything. I like seasonality well enough, the dappling light on a fruit tree, the smell of a flatbread under a hot sun, Christmas spices against the cold. But what I really want to know, from a food writer, is what they are actually like. What kind of friend they are, what kind of parent, what kind of offspring, what kind of spouse \u2013 that way I will know if it\u2019s going to be, you know, tasty.\n\nThe axiom in general writing is that humour seems like an aside, but is actually always in the centre: that is what makes you trust the author. That is how you can believe the bits that aren\u2019t funny. In food writing, you find the beating heart in what they did to a quail (Nigella) or a pea shoot (Rowley Leigh), an egg (Delia Smith), or 60 langoustines that all had to be slain one by one (Richard Olney). Your conclusions (Nigella has a heart as hot as a furnace; Leigh is a barrel-full of urbane mischief; Smith is the ground zero of moral certainty and may even be a saint; Olney is a tortured soul who lies awake at night wondering if mousse is the right thing to do to an artichoke) could be right or wrong. The important thing is that some confluence of food and words made you able to draw them.\n\nYasmin Alibhai-Brown made this explicit leap from recipe to self-reveal with The Settler\u2019s Cookbook, tracing her family\u2019s journey from India to Britain, via Idi Amin\u2019s Uganda, but, more importantly, the diaspora experiences of the dishes that went with them. Cooking from that book always feels presumptuous, like trying on someone else\u2019s heirlooms while they\u2019re in the toilet. But it is also so evocative, like being almost able to smell someone else\u2019s childhood.\n\nFood historians have one over on everyone, with their deep anthropological purpose: nobody\u2019s really talking about a Roman\u2019s way with corn to get you to taste it, or the fact that orphan waifs used to squash themselves between diners in Tudor times so that you, too, can try gorging on someone else\u2019s leftover gristle. They do it (the book everyone raves about is Margaret Visser\u2019s Much Depends on Dinner) to hurtle you back through centuries. Unfortunately \u2013 and I\u2019ll go to the wall over this conclusion \u2013 humans are at their least interesting when they are eating; they are only really interesting when they are killing each other.", "description": "It\u2019s easy to write beautifully if you can work yourself into a frenzy of love or loathing.
