Ms. Huffman is prepared to serve the term of imprisonment Judge [Indira] Talwani ordered as one part of the punishment she imposed for Ms. Huffman\u2019s actions,' a rep for Huffman said in a statement Tuesday.\n\n'She will begin serving the remainder of the sentence Judge Talwani imposed -- one year of supervised release, with conditions including 250 hours of community service -- when she is released.'\n\nA source close to the new inmate told Entertainment Tonight that her husband William H Macy dropped her off at the facility.\n\n'Felicity was resigned to the fact she has to pay her dues to society. She is looking forward to putting this all behind her,' the source said.\n\n'Bill drove her there and dropped her off. Bill is supporting her and standing by her. He's a rock and very supportive. She has a lot of family and friend support around her.'\n\nHuffman was reportedly driven to the prison by her husband, William H Macy. The couple are seen leaving Boston Criminal Court after her September 13 sentencing\n\nHuffman's lawyers had asked Judge Talwani to recommend that she be allowed to serve her sentence in Dublin because it's the closest federal prison to her home in Los Angeles.\n\nThe decision to place her there was ultimately made by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nFCI Dublin is one of four federal penitentiaries in the US prison system that exclusively houses female inmates with a population of 1,235.\n\nLocals often refer to the facility 'Chateau Dublin' because 'it's more like a luxury retreat than a prison', a source told RadarOnline.\n\nIt's located close to the Bay Area, where the weather is pleasant year-round.\n\nHuffman's lawyers had asked a judge to recommend that she be allowed to serve her sentence in Dublin because it's the closest federal prison to her home in Los Angeles\n\nThe prison is located close to the Bay Area, where the weather is pleasant year-round. Locals have even dubbed the facility 'Chateau Dublin'\n\nHuffman will have the inmate number 77806-112. She is expected to serve the full 14 days because there is no time off for good behavior in the federal system for inmates sentenced to less than a year.\n\nUnder FCI Dublin's rules, inmates are required to be in bed for lights out at 10pm every night. They have to be up with beds made by 6.30am for a daily inspection.\n\nInmates face restrictions in their email communications, the recipients of which must be pre-approved.\n\nEmails are sent through a software that gives the recipients of the messages the option of accepting or rejecting correspondence.\n\nEmail messages are also limited to 13,000 characters, and there are no pictures or other attachments.\n\nHuffman will be allowed to have visitors on Saturdays and Sundays between 8am and 2pm, though inmates are not allowed to receive gifts.\n\nFCI Dublin's famous inmates Dublin has had some famous inmates in its history. Among the most notable are Heidi Fleiss, the 'Hollywood Madam' who was convicted of money laundering and tax evasion in 1997. Fleiss gained fame for operating a prostitution ring that catered to high-profile Hollywood clients. She was sentenced to seven years and served 20 months in Dublin before being released. Another famous inmate at Dublin was Patty Hearst. The daughter of publishing giant William Randolph Hearst, Hearst made headlines in 1974, when she took part in a bank robbery with members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. The SLA, a left-wing anti-capitalist terrorist organization, kidnapped Hearst when she was 19 years old. Hearst then joined the group, though she later claimed to have been brainwashed, threatened, and sexually assaulted in captivity. After her conviction in 1976, she served 21 months at Dublin thanks to then-President Jimmy Carter's commutation of her sentence. In 2001, she received a full pardon from then-President Bill Clinton. Sara Jane Moore was released on parole in 2007 after serving 32 years of a life sentence for the attempted assassination of then-President Gerald Ford. Before Dublin became an all-female prison, it also housed famous male inmates, including Stacey Koon and Laurence Powell. Koon and Powell were two of five white Los Angeles police officers filmed in the violent beating of Rodney King in 1992. They were acquitted in a California court that year, contributing to the racial tensions that led to the Los Angeles riots. Federal authorities tried and convicted Koon and Powell for violating King's civil rights. They served 24 months in prison.\n\nInmates are permitted to receive $35 from visitors, but that money can only be used for the vending machines.\n\nInmates are also allowed up to $320 per month to spend at the prison commissary, which offers candy, cookies, ice cream, instant coffee, toiletries, and greeting cards for sale.\n\nThere are also televisions in the lobby which are available for viewing on weekdays until 8.45pm, though the prison does provide exceptions for any special programming, including major sporting events or news.\n\nInmates are also allowed to play card games and board games in the lobbies.\n\nThe facilities also offer inmates job training in the fields of customer service and sales for those interested in working at its call center.\n\nInmates are taught telephone manners and techniques as well as computer typing.\n\nThe prison offers education courses such as English, Spanish, vocational training in computer graphics and software, and apprenticeship programs in a number of fields, including plumbing, landscaping, and construction.\n\nInmates are also given the option of pursuing 'recreation and leisure' activities and programs, according to the official Bureau of Prisons (BOP) handbook for Dublin.\n\nThey include arts and crafts, intramural team sports like softball and volleyball, and physical fitness and weight loss programs.\n\n'These programs help inmates develop an individual wellness concept,' the BOP says in its guidebook.\n\n'Physical fitness and weight reduction programs are also important activities for an inmate and contribute to mental health, good interpersonal relations and stress reduction.\n\n'In addition, inmates can learn to use their free time constructively.'\n\nWhile the conditions at Dublin may not be as brutal as other facilities, those who have served time behind bars say that Huffman is still in for a rough time.\n\nFor two weeks, the actress will exchange the comfortable confines of her Los Angeles home for a noisy, crowded dormitory where inmates eat prison food while their every move is watched by guards.\n\nHolli Coulman, a former Hewlett-Packard executive who served 15 months in a different federal prison after she was convicted of fraud, told Bay Area News Group that she was routinely harassed and abused by guards.\n\nCoulman served time at the minimum security prison in Victorville, California.\n\nMartha Stewart, the domestic lifestyle mogul, spent five months in a minimum-security prison in West Virginia in 2004.\n\nShe was convicted of lying to federal investigators about securities violations.\n\nIn 2017, she told Katie Couric: 'It was horrifying, and no one - no one - should have to go through that kind of indignity, really, except for murderers, and there are a few other categories.'\n\nStewart was asked if prison time was a 'growth experience.'\n\n'That you can make lemons out of lemonade? What hurts you makes you stronger? No,' she said.\n\n'None of those adages fit at all. It's a horrible experience. Nothing is good about it, nothing.'\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty in May to fraud and conspiracy for paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her daughter Sophia's SAT answers. Huffman and Macy are pictured with their daughters Georgia and Sophia at the Golden Globes in January\n\nHuffman received her sentence in Boston Criminal Court last month after she pleaded guilty in May to fraud and conspiracy for paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her daughter Sophia's SAT answers.\n\nThe Desperate Housewives star broke down in tears just moments before she learned her fate last month.\n\n'I have inflicted more damage than I could've ever imagined,' she said.\n\nShe then admitted her guilt once more and told the judge her actions were 'frightened, stupid and so wrong,' and added that she deserved whatever sentence was handed down.\n\nFELICITY HUFFMAN STATEMENT I accept the court\u2019s decision today without reservation. I have always been prepared to accept whatever punishment Judge Talwani imposed. I broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period. I would like to apologize again to my daughter, my husband, my family and the educational community for my actions. And I especially want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices supporting their children. I have learned a lot over the last six months about my flaws as a person. My goal now is to serve the sentence that the court has given me. I look forward to doing my community service hours and making a positive impact on my community. I also plan to continue making contributions wherever I can well after those service hours are completed. I can promise you that in the months and years to come that I will try and live a more honest life, serve as a better role model for my daughters and family and continue to contribute my time and energies wherever I am needed. My hope now is that my family, my friends and my community will forgive me for my actions.\n\nThat tearful display came almost 30 minutes after the hearing kicked off with the federal prosecutor assigned to the case reprimanding the actions that resulted in Huffman's indictment and ridiculing her excuses.\n\nRight off the bat, the prosecution commented on Huffman's claim that it was her 'parental anxiety' that lead her to bribe an official in order to guarantee her daughter a better SAT test score.\n\n'With all due respect to the defendant, welcome to parenthood,' said Assistant US Attorney Eric Rosen.\n\n'There's no instruction manual. Parenthood is exhausting and stressful, but that's what every parent goes through.'\n\nHe later noted: 'Parenthood does not make you a felon or make you cheat. It makes you serve as a positive role model.'\n\nThe prosecution asked the judge for a one-month sentence.\n\nHuffman's lawyers asked that she be given a year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine instead.\n\nThey argued that her crimes were less serious than those of her co-defendants in the fraud scheme.\n\nIn explaining the 14-day ruling, Judge Talwani said: 'The outrage in this case is a system that is already so distorted by money and privilege in the first place.\n\n'And that in a system in that context, that you took the step of having one more advantage to put your child ahead.'\n\nProsecutors determined that Huffman acted without the knowledge of her husband, so Macy was not charged.\n\nA total of 51 people have been charged in the college admissions scandal dubbed 'Varsity Blues'.\n\nProsecutors said parents conspired to enhance test scores and bribed coaches to get their children into elite schools such as Harvard and USC by having them labeled as recruited athletes for sports they didn't even play.\n\nThe mastermind the scheme was admission consultant William 'Rick' Singer, who pleaded guilty for his role.\n\nThe amount Huffman paid is relatively low compared with other bribes alleged in the scheme as some parents are accused of paying up to $500,000.\n\nFifteen parents have pleaded guilty while 19 others are fighting charges.\n\nAmong those contesting the charges are Full House actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who allegedly paid half a million dollars to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake athletes.\n\nLoughlin and Giannulli each face up to 40 years in prison.\n\nLawyers for the individuals fighting the charges are due in court for a status conference in January.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons confirmed to DailyMail.com that she is in custody.\n\nFull House actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli were also implicated in the college admissions scandal but are contesting the charges.
