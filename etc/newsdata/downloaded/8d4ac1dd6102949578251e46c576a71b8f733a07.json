They want a new trial before he\u2019s executed.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nIn this Dec. 2003, file photo, death row inmate Randy Halprin, then 26, sits in a visitation cell at the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, Tex. Halprin, a Jewish death row inmate who was part of the \"Texas 7\" gang of escaped prisoners, has filed an appeal claiming the judge who convicted him was anti-Semitic and frequently used racial slurs. (Brett Coomer, File)\n\nOn the stand for his capital murder trial, Randy Halprin stressed that while he did carry a gun with him after escaping a Texas prison with six others, he did not kill a police officer during a robbery that would set off a nationwide manhunt.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t intend the death of that officer. I didn\u2019t shoot him. I didn\u2019t pull my gun,\u201d Halprin said in 2003 of the fatal shooting of Irving, Tex., police officer Aubrey Hawkins at a sporting goods store on Christmas Eve 2000. \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate anyone getting killed.\u201d\n\nHalprin, who was serving a 30-year sentence for injury to a child before fleeing with the \u201cTexas 7\u201d gang of prison escapees, was found guilty days after his testimony, and it did not take long for Dallas County District Judge Vickers \u201cVic\u201d Cunningham to give him the death penalty. But as Halprin was sentenced to die, the judge who sent him to death row allegedly referred to him by an anti-Semitic slur and as \u201cthat f-----' Jew,\u201d while adding that Jews \u201cneeded to be shut down because they controlled all the money.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t stop there. As the Dallas Morning News revealed last year, Cunningham\u2019s family described him as a \u201clifelong racist\u201d who regularly used offensive language toward African Americans and Hispanics and even set up a trust for his children that would only give them money if they married another white person.\n\nOn Thursday, Halprin\u2019s attorneys filed a notice requesting that their 41-year-old client, who is scheduled to be executed on Oct. 10, be granted a new trial. They contend Halprin\u2019s constitutional right to due process was violated because of Cunningham\u2019s alleged anti-Semitic views, saying he \u201charbored deep-seated animus towards and prejudices about non-white, non-Christian people.\u201d In addition to the notice to Dallas County and the state\u2019s appeals court, more than 100 Jewish attorneys from Texas filed an amicus brief in support of Halprin\u2019s push for a new trial. (Similar backing has come from the Anti-Defamation League.)\n\n\u201cIf Judge Cunningham is the bigot described in the application, a fair trial has not yet happened,\u201d the Jewish lawyers wrote.\n\nCunningham, 57, has denied the allegations, which were filed in an appeal in the spring, based on recent interviews with associates. He did not respond to a request for comment late Thursday, but Cunningham maintained to the Morning News that he was neither anti-Semitic nor racist.\n\n\u201cThe fabrications contained in the writ are more of the same lies from my estranged brother and his friends,\u201d Cunningham told the outlet in June, referring to his brother, Bill, who is married to an African American man, according to the Morning News. \u201cI have not communicated with him since our father\u2019s funeral. I will not be commenting further.\u201d\n\nAs the Morning News reported in June, a person familiar with Cunningham said the judge \u201cdid not like anyone not of his race, religion or creed, and he was very vocal about his disapproval,\u201d and remembered him using slurs in suggesting how minorities \u201cwalking into his courtroom knew they were going to go down.\u201d Another associate remembered him calling Halprin \u201cthe Jew\u201d during campaign events.\n\nThe newspaper previously reported that Cunningham, while rebuking his brother\u2019s claim that he was a racist, acknowledged that he had indeed set up a living trust that would reward his children if they married a straight white Christian. The allegations came to light during Cunningham\u2019s campaign for the Dallas County Commission, which the former criminal district judge lost in a Republican runoff in May 2018.\n\n\u201cI strongly support traditional family values,\u201d he said to the Morning News last year, defending the trust he set up for his children. \u201cIf you marry a person of the opposite sex that\u2019s Caucasian, that\u2019s Christian, they will get a distribution.\u201d\n\n[Dallas County candidate admits plan to reward his children who marry white, straight Christians]\n\nWhile in jail for violently beating a 16-month-old he was babysitting, Halprin and six other inmates pulled off an elaborate scheme to knock out and impersonate prison guards. They escaped the John B. Connally Unit, a maximum-security facility, on Dec. 13, 2000, and then went on a crime spree, which sparked a nationwide manhunt. They ended up at an Oshman\u2019s Sporting Goods in North Texas on Christmas Eve, looking for more weapons and money. When Hawkins, the 29-year-old police officer, responded to a call at around 6:30 p.m., the cop was shot 11 times and run over. Soon after the escapees were featured on an episode of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d in January 2001, six of the seven men were apprehended in Colorado; one man killed himself before police could arrest him. Four of the six men have already been executed, with Halprin and another man scheduled to die this fall.\n\nBut the death row inmate still argues he did not kill Hawkins and expressed hope that he could get a new trial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still in shock and reflecting on the news that I had a judge who hated Jews,\u201d Halprin wrote in June from prison. \u201cIt\u2019s just a weird thing to have someone hate you for a religious view or how you were raised, or whatever.\u201d He added, \u201cI can only hope the court is fair and pays attention to this.\u201d\n\nMarc R. Stanley, a Dallas attorney who submitted the amicus brief on behalf of the Jewish lawyers, told The Washington Post that while the charges against Halprin are serious, he\u2019s entitled to a new trial given the allegations of anti-Semitism.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s scheduled to die in October, so we had to do something to have some impact and we hope this does,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cThe case is clearly outrageous and offends our system of justice and rule of law.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\n\u2018Being Christian is love\u2019: Drew Brees defends appearing in video linked to anti-LGBT religious group\n\n\u2018I\u2019m about to die\u2019: A woman escaped a serial killer by stabbing him and jumping out a window, police say", "description": "Halprin\u2019s attorneys filed a notice requesting that their 41-year-old client, who is scheduled to be executed on Oct. 10, be granted a new trial, arguing that there was no way the recent revelations of the former judge\u2019s alleged bias and hateful sentiments did not play a role in the case.", "authors": ["Timothy Bella", "Deputy Editor For Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Timothy Bella Is The Deputy Editor Of Morning Mix.
