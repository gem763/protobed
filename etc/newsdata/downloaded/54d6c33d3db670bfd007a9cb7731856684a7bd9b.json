Redick joined ESPN NBA insider Zach Lowe on Lowe's podcast this week to talk about his new opportunity. They also reflected a bit on his time with the Sixers and the tough loss to the eventual NBA champion Toronto Raptors in the playoffs after four bounces of a Kawhi Leonard desperation shot.\n\nRedick is open about the fact that the decision to move on to New Orleans was partly financial.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\"I never got the sense that [the Sixers] didn't want to bring me back. Unfortunately, it came down to a little bit of economics,\" Redick said.\n\nJimmy Butler's decision to move on to the Miami Heat obviously precipitated that move. Redick speaks highly of Butler regardless of his decision.\n\n\"I love Jimmy. I would play with Jimmy again,\" Redick said. \"He is in the upper tier of two-way players and in the upper tier of offensive players in the NBA, period.\"\n\nSo Redick has moved on to New Orleans, but it's tough not to think back to what could have been. There was a point in the Toronto series where Redick believed the Sixers were capable of winning the NBA championship last season.\n\n\"Joel [Embiid] and I spent some time together after the season and we talked about it. It was Game 4 [against Toronto] for us. We lost that game and I felt like, for most of that game, we had control, not just that game but that series. We had a chance to go up 3-1. That was the opportunity that we missed. You lose that game and it's 2-2 and you've got to win 2 out of 3 against Toronto, and that's a tough task.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOne other interesting nugget from Redick's time in Philly was his sharing that he believed they didn't do enough team dinners on the road.\n\n\"I wish, I've tried, I wish, the team meal on the road is huge. I think it's huge. We didn't do it enough last year in Philly. We tried. It wasn't enough. Some of that, look, nobody wants to be forced to go to dinner. It's got to be real and authentic.\"\n\nSome other choice quotes from the pod below.\n\nOn Ben Simmons getting a jumper.\n\n\"Ben works. He worked all of last offseason. I witnessed him during the season get his shots up after practice every day. I think he'll be able to shoot at some point. A lot of it is confidence. He can shoot a high enough clip when he's shooting spot shots that it should translate to shooting threes in a game. The video that went viral, looks to me like he's shooting with some confidence there.\"\n\nLowe also asked Redick about the dagger shot in Toronto.\n\n\"I was on the bench,\" Redick said. \"I sort of had that perfect angle 'cause as soon as the ball had come inbounds, I sort of walked onto the baseline. Not on the court, but onto the baseline so I could get a straight-on view of the action. My memory may be a little jogged but my arms were crossed, I was watching the ball bounce around the rim, and it went in. I'm not sure I had any initial reaction, I think it was just shock. Part of you wants to walk off the floor and punch a wall and the other part of you, if I'm the Raptors, I'd want to dap up the people that I had just played a seven-game series against. I stayed on the court and talked to Kyle, Marc, Kawhi, Danny and those guys. Told them I hope they win a championship and walked off. Then you get back to the locker room and you see the emotion, I was obviously feeling emotional, then Joel started crying. Those are the sorts of moments that you don't forget. As much as you don't forget the shot, the aftermath of moments like that, you just don't forget. There's just a lot of raw emotion.\"\n\nYou can listen to Redick's entire conversation with Zach Lowe right here.\n\nClick here to download the MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
