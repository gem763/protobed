He hears it many times at home and laughs.'\n\nThe video, shared by the woman on Facebook, spread so quickly around Lebanon that Mrs Jabbour's husband saw it even before she could tell him about it.\n\nBaby Robin looked at the men who got closer, trying to entertain him and make him laugh\n\nFootage shows the baby sitting in the passenger seat and looking around as the men start singing and dancing the popular song.\n\nThe men look happy and excited as they try to entertain the toddler.\n\nInternet users shared and commented the video.\n\nMona Bassil Machoulian wrote: 'My favourite video about the protest as of yet. And now I can't get the song out of my head. Cheers to baby Robin!'\n\nThe video of the protesters singing became so popular in Lebanon that Mrs Jabbour's husband saw it even before she could tell him about it\n\nRoula F. Barrak Hanna commented: 'At least when your son grows up, he will know someone fought for his rights and did him animation along the way. We are the best people on earth.'\n\nThe mother said the video of protesters singing to her son represents the reality for children in Lebanon.\n\n'Kids in Lebanon should have a better future,' she said.\n\n'Robin will see the video when he grows up and know that Lebanese guys were fighting for him.\n\nAnti-government protests in Lebanon began last Thursday and are now in their sixth day\n\nDemonstrations in Lebanon began last Thursday after the government announced proposed new taxes on residents.\n\nThe country's debt has stalled the economic growth and has prevented many citizens from accessing basic services.\n\nPressure from protesters pushed the government to drop the measures yesterday, cut officials' salaries and approve a 2020 budget, but the demonstrations continued to grow.\n\nEven though the government dropped the proposed new taxes on residents yesterday, the demonstrations continued to grow\n\nThis demonstration has now become the largest protest Lebanon has seen in 15 years\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri refused to resign despite protests.\n\nToday, on the sixth day of demonstrations, Lebanese protesters have set up barricades in the streets around their central rallying point in Beirut.\n\nThis has now become the largest protest Lebanon has seen in 15 years.", "description": "Eliane Jabbour was driving through Baabda District, Beirut, Lebanon, when protesters surrounded her car.
