It\u2019s likely to return to a range of $70 to $75 in the medium to long-term, a level cheap enough for consumers but valuable enough to make producers money, he said.\n\nBut for the next six months at least, prices are likely to drift lower before spurring OPEC+ to cut further and U.S. shale drillers to reduce spending, slowing down one of the fastest-growing sources of output, he said. added 0.8% to $62.90 a barrel as of 12:34 p.m. Singapore time. It has averaged about $65 this year, and was last below $51 in late December.\n\nA lower price \u201cis one of the few things that either galvanizes OPEC, makes it harder for shale to perform, or stimulates demand,\u201d Luckock said at the trading house\u2019s office in the city state. \u201cI can see us drifting toward $50 in the short term, but I think the medium to long term price is $70 to $75.\u201d\n\nOPEC Fraying\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia have been working since 2016 to balance global markets through output cuts, but at current price levels, Trafigura sees the coalition fraying. Iraq has shunned its commitments, while stalwarts like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are seeking to restart a 500,000-barrel-a-day neutral zone field next year, said Saad Rahim, the trading house\u2019s chief strategist and global head of research.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think the current level of OPEC cuts and compliance is actually enough to make oil go higher,\u201d Luckock said. Still, lower prices could rekindle the group\u2019s urgency to work together and even deepen curbs, he added.\n\nSee also: OPEC\u2019s New Saudi Kingpin Faces Demand Woes That Beat Predecessor\n\nOil will need to drop to $40 to $45 a barrel to spur OPEC to make deeper cuts, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, the Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons for member country Equatorial Guinea said during an interview in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. The cartel needs to trim another 500,000 barrels a day to boost prices to $70, industry consultant FGE said in a note the same day.\n\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co. sees 1 million barrels a day in deeper output cuts needed in 2020 to defend prices at $60 a barrel in the face of rising non-OPEC supply. On the contrary, the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said rising supply may dissuade the Saudis from seeking deeper cuts.\n\nTrafigura sees global production growing by 1.9 million barrels a day next year, with nearly half coming from shale. That will outpace demand growth, which they see at 1.6 million barrels a day. The OPEC+ pact currently has a target to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels a day.\n\nOne Solver\n\nTrafigura is shipping U.S. shale from its facility in Corpus Christi and buyers in Europe and Asia have begun asking if they can purchase the crude via long-term deals, Luckock said. The group is bullish on the Permian Basin and is looking at expanding its export project by building an offshore buoy that would allow direct loading onto the world\u2019s biggest crude tankers.\n\nStill, Luckock thinks the oil industry is relying too much on continued U.S. shale growth to meet demand, and isn\u2019t investing in more expensive, long-term projects like deepwater wells.\n\n\u201cIn the 18 month- to 5-year term, you get back into the story where you only have one solver for global demand in U.S. shale, there\u2019s underinvestment in deepwater, demand could recover, and you can see how you could return back to a more normalized price,\u201d he said.\n\n(Updates price in third paragraph, adds OPEC member, analyst comment in seventh paragraph.)", "description": "Trafigura Sees Oil Slide Near $50 Prompting Deeper OPEC Cuts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic8f0ee9f265141a2f6752c674e6bcac60.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
