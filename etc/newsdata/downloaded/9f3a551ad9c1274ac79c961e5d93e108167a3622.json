With Hong Kong facing an undercertain future, it appears more and more locals are looking to move to Australia, if search activity on realestate.com.au is any guide.\n\nAccording to data provided by Australia\u2019s no. 1 property website, search from Hong Kong was up a massive 34 per cent in September compared to the same month last year.\n\nMORE: TV icon changing the face of Aussie property\n\n\n\nGold Coast\u2019s biggest mansion hits market with $45 million price tag\n\nThe key to the perfect house flip revealed\n\n\n\nBuyer\u2019s agent Leon Jacques from Cohen Handler said word was getting back to the Australian market about what the troubles in Hong Kong could mean here.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t felt it yet but we have had a number of prospective buyers, Aussie expats, saying that if things escalate, they won\u2019t hang around. They will be on the next plane here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are also some very wealthy Asian buyers that want premium properties.\u201d\n\nOverseas buyers continue to be lured by the dependability of the Sydney and Melbourne property markets.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly more buyers and investors, both local and overseas, looking at Sydney and Melbourne as stable economies and big cities,\u201d Mr Jacques said.\n\n\u201cThe volatility in those markets is not like that in other Australian markets. The long term trend is upwards. As such they are seen as safe havens.\u201d\n\nThe areas witnessing the most dramatic increase in search activity from Hong Kong are Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. The South Australian capital is only experiencing slightly less searches from Hong Kong locals than Sydney. However when broken down suburb by suburb, the Harbour City dominates.\n\nThese were the top Australian suburbs for Hong Kong property seekers in August*:\n\n1. Chatswood\n\n2. Epping (NSW)\n\n3.

In this case it is Hong Kong, and the UK \u2014 due to the continued uncertainty over Brexit.\n\nCountries with a struggling economy can also experience significant jumps, currently New Zealand fits this billing.\n\nMORE: Rent fitness queen Ashy Bines\u2019 home\n\nAgents share their most embarrassing moments\n\nOverall Australia continues to be seen as a less attractive place than before for those in China looking to live or invest Down Under.\n\nHowever the rate of decline in search activity is plateauing.\n\n\u201cIt is likely better performance of the Sydney and Melbourne markets are drivers of this. particularly given how negative Asian buyers were towards the Australian market once the downturn began,\u201d Ms Conisbee said.", "description": "The continued political upheaval in Hong Kong could bring a wave of change to Australia\u2019s property market.", "authors": ["James Macsmith"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/10090047/capi_80234ef8eb3765fb4164c4bb1bc4b813_078e9729b86bdd34f273c0a8791e8676.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
