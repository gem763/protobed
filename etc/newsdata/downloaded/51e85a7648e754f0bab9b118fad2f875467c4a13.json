Isn\u2019t it annoying when the game keeps committing micro-aggressions against you, like telling you to \u201cadvance token to the nearest Railroad and pay owner twice the rental to which he/she is otherwise entitled,\u201d or repeatedly sending you to jail without due process?\n\nGood news: Hasbro has heard your complaints, and now they have created a board-game that even feminists can enjoy. The game\u2019s mascot is \u201cMs. Monopoly,\u201d and she is the Monopoly Man\u2019s niece and a \u201cself-made investment guru,\u201d seemingly in the vein of Emily Weiss or Sophia Amoruso. Slay, queen.\n\nThe game is touted as a \u201ccelebration of women entrepreneurs and inventors.\u201d In it, female players are given more money to start and collect more money when they pass \u201cGo.\u201d Instead of landing on various real-estate properties, each square depicts an invention made by women, ranging from \u201cstem-cell isolation\u201d to \u201cmodern shapewear.\u201d\n\nIn this new millennial feminist utopia, the railroad squares have been replaced by \u201cride-share\u201d squares. And the oppressive thimble and iron pieces: gone! Based on zooming in on the photos on Walmart\u2019s website \u2014 where the game is available next week \u2014 the pieces include a weight, a journal, a top-hat, a plane, a watch, and a wineglass. Some other ideas for game-pieces we would like to propose:\n\n-IUD\n\n-Handmaid\u2019s Tale bonnet\n\n-Jade roller\n\n-House plant\n\n-Grain bowl\n\n-Juul pod\n\n-Platform Tevas\n\n-Keychain from The Wing\n\n-Orange wine\n\n-Tiny bottle of Vintner\u2019s Daughter serum with a single usable drop of oil\n\nFinally, an excuse to become a gamer.", "description": "Her name is \u201cMs. Monopoly.\u201d", "authors": ["Anna Silman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/10/ms-monopoly/9-ms-monopoly-lede-b.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
