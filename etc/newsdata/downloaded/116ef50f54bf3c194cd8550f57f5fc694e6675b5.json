And it's quite a concern to security industries.\u201d\n\nAlready, unmanned vehicles have been causing havoc at airports. Pilots at Newark Liberty International have reported spotting drones before takeoff, prompting the delay of 170 outgoing flights early this year and the diversion of nine incoming flights to other hubs.\n\nA drone flew over Michigan Stadium this month during a football game, leaving two people in police custody. One in July hovered above a fire in Arizona, halting critical recovery operations. And another, strapped with fireworks, was found on a rooftop in downtown Los Angeles days earlier, causing authorities to close off an entire street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said spottings have \u201cincreased dramatically over the past two years\u201d and that they now \u201creceive more than 100 such reports each month.\u201d\n\nThe agency explained on its website that unauthorized drone use, especially around airplanes, helicopters, airports and other no-fly zones is \u201cdangerous and illegal.\u201d Unlawful operators \u201cmay be subject to stiff fines and criminal charges, including possible jail time.\u201d\n\nBut aviation and security experts are still concerned.\n\nWhile the FAA requires flyers to register their devices, bad actors can still make modifications outside of agency standards, Daniel R. Young, founder and chief information officer at security agency Circadian Risk, told Fox Business. \u201cThese drones can fire guns and can carry chemical weapons, biological weapons and explosives.\u201d\n\nAccording to Circadian, drones used in agriculture can fly long distances, and have carrying capacities up to 22 pounds, which is a reason for worry since the Federal Emergency Management Agency says a pipe bomb is generally in the range of 5 pounds.\n\n\u201cWith this type of payload delivery method available, it is a large concern that a group can fly multiple drones into a heavily populated area, such as an open-air stadium or concert, and create a mass-casualty incident,\u201d Circadian pointed out.\n\n\u201cIf 100 drones flew into a stadium and detonated, not only will you have blast injuries, but many other people will be injured from trying to escape and trampling others.\"\n\nThis is a possibility that \u201cpeople should take seriously,\u201d Young said.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s the potential drones could be used as spies: \u201cJust imagine you're doing [research and development] and you have a prototype of a specific vehicle,\u201d Young said. \u201cYou have a drone flying over your property taking photos and releasing those photos to car magazines. How detrimental could that be to your brand and what you\u2019re working on?\u201d\n\nSome companies are developing ways to counter bad drones.\n\nOne method: other drones programmed to attack malicious devices. Another: jammers that disrupt the signal from the original pilot and take over the device completely. There are also net cannons and rubber bullets that can disarm bad actors. But perhaps most surprisingly: birds. Eagles and hawks are being trained to take out drones that pose a threat.\n\nWith every solution, however, there are caveats. If a drone is equipped with a gun, a bird won\u2019t do much. Net cannons can have limited firing ranges. And even if a drone is captured or shot down, when it falls from the sky, \u201cwhere is it going to go?\u201d Brown said.\n\nThen there\u2019s the challenge of determining a drone\u2019s intent before it\u2019s acted out.\n\nBrown thinks the answer lies in enforcement of already existing rules, like no-fly zones. Though, that may not \u201cnecessarily stop an attack on a public event or a concert.\u201d\n\nThat's \"after the fact-type stuff, and frankly, as we saw on 9/11 \u2026 it was very much against the law for the terrorists to take control of the cockpits and fly planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that didn't stop them from doing it.\n\n\u201cIf you're going to weaponize something, you're not going to follow the law,\" he added. \"So it's more of how are we going to handle it when these things are spotted? How do you contain them?\u201d\n\nOfficials are still grappling with ways to do that. Meanwhile, the money behind drones keeps growing.\n\nTotal drone unit sales hit 2.2 million worldwide in 2016, according to research firm Gartner, and revenue surged a whopping 36 percent. Some reports forecast drone sales could surpass $12 billion in 2021, compared to just $8.5 billion in 2016.\n\nOf course, the picture isn\u2019t all grim. There are good uses for drones happening all the time, like dropping life preservers to people drowning at sea, surveying traffic accidents before officials make it to the scene and delivering medication to sick people.\n\nThere are huge benefits to drones, Brown said. \u201cBut, like with anything else, people are going to figure out how to make it bad. We just have to figure out a counter-response.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "It\u2019s possible bad actors can use drones for harm \"and it's quite a concern to security industries,\" one expert says.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
