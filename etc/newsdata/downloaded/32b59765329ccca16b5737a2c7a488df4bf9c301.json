Andreeva hinted that the EU would not hold a special summit on Brexit to approve the extension, saying the decision will be made in a statement.\n\nBritain is scheduled to leave the 28-nation bloc on Oct. 31 but has asked for a three-month extension to that deadline as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson struggles to get lawmakers to pass his Brexit divorce deal. Economists say a no-deal departure would hurt both the U.K. and the EU economies.\n\nFrance, among other EU nations, has been reluctant to approve a long Brexit extension, saying Britain must present \u201ca clear scenario\u201d for progress before another Brexit delay is granted.\n\n\u201cOur position is that simply giving more time, without political change, without ratification, without an election, would be useless,\u201d Amelie de Montchalin, France\u2019s European Affairs minister, told RTL radio Thursday night.\n\nThose comments followed Johnson\u2019s decision Thursday to push for an early election to break the stalemate in Parliament that has blocked a Brexit deal. Johnson said he would ask lawmakers to vote Monday on calling a general election on Dec. 12.\n\nTo call an election, Johnson, who leads a minority government, must win support from two-thirds of the House of Commons. But opposition parties say they won\u2019t vote for an early election until the government secures an extension of the Brexit deadline.\n\nBritain\u2019s biggest opposition party has gone a step further, saying it will block plans for an early election unless Johnson eliminates the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nDiane Abbott of Labour Party told the BBC her party wants an \u201cexplicit commitment\u201d that there won\u2019t be a no-deal Brexit, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t trust Boris Johnson.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to know that by some mischance we won\u2019t crash out of the EU without a deal, because we\u2019ve said for some time that coming out of the EU without a deal would be absolutely disastrous,\u201d she said.\n\nUntil recently, Johnson vowed that Britain would leave the EU on Oct. 31 no matter what, with or without a deal, saying this was the only way to put pressure on European officials to make concessions.\n\nJohnson last week secured a new deal with EU leaders, but British lawmakers refused to approve it before an Oct. 19 deadline imposed by Parliament. That forced him to ask the EU to extend the Brexit deadline to the end of January.\n\nSajid Javid, Britain\u2019s treasury chief, said he believes the EU will ultimately approve a three-month extension. He said the only way to break the country\u2019s political logjam was to call a new election and get rid of what he called the current \u201czombie Parliament.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree-and-a-half years ago this decision was made and there\u2019s been delay after delay after delay,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cAnd we have to end this, end this uncertainty.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPetrequin reported from Brussels.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "European Union ambassadors agreed Friday that the bloc should grant Britain's request for another extension to the Brexit deadline but have not yet figured out how long that delay should be.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Danica Kirka", "Samuel Petrequin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/Britain_EU_Brexit_33250.jpg-eb2fb_c0-0-3456-2016_s1200x700.jpg?1ed36591d45af094a8d40b2881f8aed6f80457e1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
