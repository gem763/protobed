He has said he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than do so.\n\nAny extension would depend on all 27 EU leaders saying yes.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Sell-out deal\u2019 \u2013\n\nJohnson took office in July after his predecessor Theresa May failed three times to get her own divorce deal through parliament.\n\nHe insists that Brexit must happen this month to end the uncertainty that has weighed on the economy and dominated political and public debate.\n\nHowever, the vote rests on a knife-edge.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Johnson\u2019s minority government, will vote against it because of its arrangements for the British province.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party, led by veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn, is set against the deal.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s sell-out deal risks triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS (National Health Service) to a takeover by US corporations,\u201d said Corbyn.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Sick and tired\u2019 \u2013\n\nEurosceptic newspapers urged MPs to back the deal.\n\nThe Daily Express front page said: \u201cRespect the will of the people and let\u2019s move on.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Telegraph said it was Britain\u2019s best chance for an orderly departure.\n\n\u201cPeople are sick and tired of the delay and fed up with procedural trickery,\u201d it said of the proposed amendment.\n\nAn online Survation poll of 1,025 adults on Thursday and Friday for the Daily Mail found that 50 percent said MPs should vote for the deal, while 38 percent said not.\n\nMeanwhile, The Times said: \u201cOn behalf of a bored and disillusioned country, increasingly angry with Westminster, MPs should back the deal.\u201d\n\nEU leaders in Brussels this week urged lawmakers to back the deal, to allow both sides to move on to discussing their future relationship.\n\nThe deal covers Britain\u2019s financial settlement, protects the rights of EU citizens and sets out a post-Brexit transition period potentially until 2022 to allow both sides to agree new trade terms.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British MPs gathered on Saturday for a knife-edge vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal for a decision that could", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/47e585_historic-vote-saturday-house-commons-see-united-kingdom-leave-european-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
