In those shootings, 9,928 people have died and 19,856 people have been injured.\n\nAfter a gunman in the Texas border city of El Paso killed 22 people after opening fire at a Walmart, President Donald Trump cited poor mental health and violent video games as a driver for those who commit mass shootings, but scientific research doesn't support those claims.\n\nMultiple studies have repeatedly shown that mental-health issues are not predictive of violence, and the number of gun deaths in the US is much higher than in other nations with similar rates of gun ownership, Business Insider's Aylin Woodward reported. Democrats have advocated fo certain policies that have helped prevent deaths elsewhere, including stricter background checks, rules prohibiting domestic abusers from owning weapons, and secure locks on firearms in the home with decreased rates of gun-related deaths.\n\nRead more: Gun control really works.
