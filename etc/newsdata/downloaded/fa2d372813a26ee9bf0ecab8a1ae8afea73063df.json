Jim DeMint, Citizens United President David Bossie and Club for Growth President David McIntosh, wrote a letter this week pushing for Cuccinelli.\n\n\u201cKen Cuccinelli checks two boxes for President Trump \u2014 style and substance,\u201d said RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which has been supportive of Cuccinelli in conversations with the White House. \u201cHe\u2019ll successfully manage the sprawling bureaucracy at DHS, push back against activist judges and, most importantly, continue implementing President Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\u201d\n\nMorgan rejoined the Trump administration in May as acting ICE director, but moved to CBP the next month. The appointment represented a rapid ascent for the former Obama official, who left his post as Border Patrol chief during the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nSince taking over at CBP, he\u2019s hosted White House briefings on border security and repeatedly praised the president\u2019s enforcement strategies. At the same time, he\u2019s brushed aside humanitarian concerns over Trump policies, such as \u201cremain in Mexico,\u201d which forces certain non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in that country pending the outcome of their U.S. cases.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection spokesman declined to make Morgan available to discuss the possibility that he might be tapped for the secretary job. DHS declined to comment when asked who would become acting secretary after McAleenan\u2019s departure. Instead, the department referred the request to the White House.\n\nHoman unapologetically carried out Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown through the first year and a half of the administration until his retirement in mid-2018. Trump announced in June that Homan would return as a \u201cborder czar,\u201d but Homan was caught unaware and the move never happened.\n\nWhile Homan said the White House has not contacted him about the DHS secretary role, he said he would consider it. \u201cI\u2019m not saying no, I\u2019m not saying yes, but I\u2019d sit down and have a discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe appointment of Cuccinelli, Morgan or Homan as acting secretary or a similar workaround, however, could trigger legal challenges.\n\nA statute that governs DHS succession places the deputy secretary and under secretary for management in line for the acting secretary role, although both of those positions are currently filled by acting officials.\n\nRebecca Jones, policy counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington-based watchdog, contends that the lack of Senate-confirmed officials within the Trump administration \u2014 and at DHS specifically \u2014 violates the Constitution\u2019s mandate that the Senate vet and approve presidential nominees.\n\n\u201cIt might be more convenient for the president to have people who are immediately going to do exactly what he wants them to do in the moment, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s beneficial to our democracy, or transparency or accountability,\u201d she said.\n\nMorning Shift Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Homan left the administration in late June 2018, which means he spent less than 90 days at the department before her exit.\n\nStill, the White House used creative workarounds to install Cuccinelli and Morgan in their current roles. In both cases, the administration created new \u201cprincipal deputy director\u201d positions that allowed each official to run their respective agencies.\n\nCuccinelli\u2019s appointment to USCIS already has been challenged in several lawsuits that argue the move violated federal law and a constitutional requirement for the Senate to vet top-level officials.\n\nTony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 27,000 CBP employees worldwide, argued that top-level vacancies can hurt the performance of workers throughout an organization.\n\n\u201cEvery agency needs stable leadership that puts forth consistent policies and guidance and sees that the workforce has the training and tools needed to implement those policies,\u201d Reardon said in a written statement. \u201cTurnovers and vacancies at the highest levels makes this much more difficult.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Rj Hauman", "Government Relations Director At The Federation For American Immigration Reform"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b2/a7/a0d0bf7643798ef6500a883f0a04/20191016-cuccinelli-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
