Some waved at the president as he smiled and gave a thumbs-up.\n\nAt the end of the third inning, ballpark video screens carried a salute to U.S. service members that drew cheers throughout the stadium.\n\nWhen the video cut to Trump and his entourage cheers abruptly turned into a torrent of boos and heckling.

A dozen or so congressional lawmakers accompanied the president, according to a list provided by the White House, including Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and David Perdue Georgia.\n\n'I think everybody is excited,\" Nationals star pitcher Stephen Strasburg said before the game. \"It's the president of the United States. So there's obviously beefed-up security. So usually the dogs that are sniffing in our clubhouse are these nice Labs that are super friendly. And today there was a German shepherd that I didn't really feel comfortable petting.'\n\nNationals manager Dave Martinez said: 'He's coming to the game. He's a fan. Hopefully he cheers for the Washington Nationals, and I hope he enjoys the game.'\n\nTrump's staff has long tried to shield him from events where he might be loudly booed or heckled, and he has rarely ventured into the neighborhoods of the heavily Democratic city. He won just over four percent of the vote in the District of Columbia in 2016.\n\nTrump's staff has long tried to shield him from events where he might be loudly booed or heckled, and he has rarely ventured into the neighborhoods of the heavily Democratic city.

He has a history with Trump, too, both in business and in politics.\n\nAndr\u00e9s has repeatedly opposed Trump's immigration policies and his administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\n\nFour years ago, he withdrew from plans to open a restaurant in the Trump International Hotel in Washington following Trump's controversial comments about Mexican immigrants during the presidential campaign. Legal action ensued and the dispute was settled in 2017.", "description": "President Donald Trump's low-profile appearance Sunday night at Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park, DC, came at a high-profile moment of his presidency - yet he still drew loud boos.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/02/wire-20263700-1572228286-239_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
