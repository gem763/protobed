A lazy, diversified portfolio worked fine. Bonds outperformed stocks. A 60-40 portfolio was up +14.45% YTD and +5.53% for 12-mo. Now comes September, typically the worst month. Bond market is projecting 3 rate cuts by mid-2020 and some strategists are calling for zero US rates. But if there is no recession in the US [consumer spending, jobs, wages remain strong], the rates may reverse and rise instead [that is the risk].\n\nThis is getting crazy \u2013 bonds for capital gains, stocks for income. Much of the bond overvaluation via nil/negative rates [YTM] is in foreign sovereigns. But these exclude the US munis \u2013 their tax exemption is not of much value to institutions and foreign funds, and they are not very liquid. Some high-quality munis [TX, MN, etc] now yield more than the Treasuries of corresponding maturities \u2013 it should be reverse due to muni tax exemption. Muni CEFs provide higher yields due to leverage [PML, NAD/NEA, BTT, etc]. [Forsyth\u2019s CEF picks have been primarily based on discounts and may not be the best]\n\nPg 7, Streetwise: Some companies that broke up a while ago are getting back together \u2013 Humpty-Dumpty trend. Current T is in part a recreation of the old Ma Bell . Current XOM is a partial recreation of the old Standard Oil . CBS and VIAB have gotten that urge to merge again, so have MO and PM. These recreations are often going for scale in mature and declining businesses. Wall Street is happy to oblige \u2013 acquisition, consolidation, restructure, go-private, go-public, go-bankrupt \u2013 whatever, so long as the deal fees keep flowing. Of course, the management that was in place when company was broken up is not the same management doing the recreation, so nobody has to admit mistakes. And wait until Humpty-Dumpty falls off the wall again.\n\nPg 8-9: No notable upcoming meetings.\n\nKFC/YUM ran out of chicken-less \u201cchicken\u201d [alt-meat] in 5 hours. Beyond Meat [BYND] may be overvalued as there is competition developing in the alt-meat category, with the newest being a startup Before the Butcher started by a former SYY executive.\n\nHome equipment subscription and exercise classes business Peloton will soon have its IPO. It is losing 21% on revenue but says that is due to heavy capex.\n\nClosed: US and Canada on Monday.\n\nData this week: ISM manufacturing report, construction spending on Tuesday; international trade deficit on Wednesday [Canada has been the top US trading partner since 2015; Mexico has now passed over China]; ADP employment report, ISM nonmanufacturing report, factory orders on Thursday; jobs report [+157,000], unemployment rate [3.7%] on Friday.\n\nBullish Recommendations: Activision Blizzard [ATVI; fwd P/E 20; promising rereleases of several old games \u2013 World of Warcraft Classic (August rerelease of 2004 game), Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (October rerelease of 2007 game), future rereleases of Overwatch, Diablo , etc; pg 26].\n\nBearish Recommendations: None self standing\n\nPg 11: After OK court ordered JNJ, a tough litigator, to pay $572 million in opioid damages, other companies are settling, or looking to settle, opioid lawsuits \u2013 ENDP, AGN, Purdue Pharma [also considering bankruptcy], etc.\n\nPg 13: Five strategists\u2019 views on markets by the yearend; Lori Calvasina/ RBC Capital , Richard Lacaille/ State Street , Dubravko Lakos-Bujas/ JP Morgan , Saira Malik/ Nuveen [TIAA], Edward Yardini/ Yardini Research . Some wide ranges are due to uncertainties in trade [China, EU, Asia, Canada, Mexico], tariffs, the Fed, pre-election year actions, higher volatility, etc. Generally, most optimistic is Yardini and most pessimistic is Malik.\n\nSP500: 2,700-3,100\n\nSP500 EPS: $159-167\n\nSP500 P/E: 17.0-18.6\n\nUS GDP Growth: 2.10%-2.40%\n\nFed Fund Rate: 1.50-1.75% or 1.75%-2.00% [1 or 2 cuts]\n\n10-Yr Treasury Yield: 1.25%-2.15%\n\nPg 15: Hedge-funds run for reinsurers at discount, GLRE [fwd P/E 9.3; P/B 0.7; David Einhorn], TPRE [fwd P/E 3.3; P/B 0.7; Daniel Loeb].\n\nPg 16: Cover Story, \u201cNext Frontier in Treating Disease - Biotechnology\u201d. MRNA [stakes owned by AZN, MRK], TBIO [stakes owned by TAK, GSK], ARCT, and private German companies CureVac and BioNTech are mentioned.\n\nPg 21: Bryan Hinmon [also CIO of Motley Fool Asset Management ] of global FOOLX searches for opportunities anywhere. He is a thematic investor who likes online retail, digital workplace, etc. Fund holds 40-50 stocks with strong balance sheets that can withstand the next crisis.\n\nPg 22: Low-volatility USMV vs SPLV. Both are expensive now with trailing P/E 24 vs 19. Low-volatility is inversely correlated to rates, so they have done well. USMV owns lowest volatility stocks in each sector [so, better diversified], while SPLV goes for low-volatility overall [with higher weights in utilities, real-estate]. Factor purists may like SPLV, but USMV is better for most investors.\n\nPg 24: Avoid these mistakes for 401k: Cashing out [14% do that]; too many rollovers [if money goes through your hands, you have 60 days to rollover into IRA or another qualified plan; allowed once every 12 months]; assuming that rollover/direct-transfer to IRA is best [you may lose access to special or institutional funds; may lose some creditor protections]; overlooking tax strategies [conversion to Roth IRA; withdrawing employer stock in-kind to defer taxes on capital gains].\n\nPg 27: Re-fi if you have mortgage \u2013 that may also adversely affect the Fed\u2019s gradual balance sheet shift from mortgages to Treasuries. However, due to re-fi costs and inertia, not all will do so. Increased re-fi activity will impact the bond market as mortgage bonds have negative-convexity [duration decreases when rates fall and increases when rates rise; mortgage investors are compensated for this via spreads], so institutional investors hedge mortgages with rate-swaps and long-bond. This in turn affects the long-term rates \u2013 they tend to go down with high re-fi activity, but that reverses when the re-fi subside. The Fed may be forced to change its pace of shift from mortgages to Treasury to keep mortgage rates and long-rates in check.\n\nPg 28: Rob Fagan, GMP Securities [Canada]. The US pot/cannabis stocks [GTBIF (P/EBITDA 20), TCNNF (P/EBITDA 6), CURLF (acquiring vaping company Cura Partners )] are more attractive than Canadian ones as their P/S are around only 1 vs 10. As they are not legal in federal law, the US pot stocks cannot list in the US exchanges but list at small Canadian Securities Exchange and/or OTC. There is also a tiny US ETF YOLO.\n\nPg 30: James Grant, Current Yield. Why is the Fed concerned about pushing inflation up to 2% [+/-] when $17 trillion in global bonds have negative yields? A London strategist said that instead of looking at negative yields as a sign of bond bubble, politicians should act now to prevent global deflation. Bezos and his company AMZN have singlehandedly created lot of this deflation [really read disruptive techs]. One has to go back to pre-1958 to find stock yields higher than high-quality bond yields. Barron\u2019s used to cost 35c then [vs $5 now]. Grant likes gold, $ bills, stocks, bonds \u2013 in that order.\n\nPg 31: Consider income from MBS PMZIX, MWCIX and REITs AVB, EQR.\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nDividend aristocrats [rising dividends for 25+ years; versions are in the US, Europe, Japan] may be overvalued now.\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 5, Up & Down Wall Street: August was crazy due to 3Ts \u2013 tweets, trade, Treasuries.
