Sparked by curiosity, they set out to discover anything and everything new while sharing about their discoveries. Young children\u2019s learning develops through making and testing theories continually. It\u2019s exhilarating work!\n\nWhen adults notice children\u2019s ideas and theories as well as name and build children\u2019s vocabulary through talk, or when they encourage children to make connections to previous experiences as they read together, they help nourish positive attitudes about literacy.\n\nFor those slow-down moments when you as a child\u2019s caregiver are looking for ways to model and enjoy literacy together, one cost-friendly idea is to create a nook or nest (indoors or out) for reading. Your book nest can be as uncomplicated as gathering a sheet, some clothespins, the couch cushions and a couple of chairs.\n\nLoose parts play\n\nAlso see: Find free resources for little readers in our STORYTIME hub!\n\nWhat is the source of all the excitement? When the child, with you alongside, can use these items to design a little tent or cushion nest, they are engineering spaces of their very own. The child is experiencing what early childhood development experts call loose parts play: through manipulating free and loose parts, children delight in becoming architects of spaces they share.\n\nWith loose parts play, items can be used in multiple ways for designing, creating and testing prototypes. Every peg point and toppled pillow will offer problem-solving scenarios that call for solutions. And let\u2019s not forget that with some pillows and soft blankets inside, the opportunity arises for the caregiver to lay back and relax!\n\nNext, consider having your child fill an old cereal box, basket or cloth tote full of their favourite books to explore in their newly designed space.\n\nBooks for your cozy space\n\nThese seven titles are packed full of adventure and are worth a look at your local library. You may find your child asks to read favourite books over and over, celebrating the joy of reading!\n\n1. Knuffle Bunny\n\n(Walker Books Ltd.)\n\nBy Mo Willems (2005, Walker Books Ltd.)\n\nPicture books with human characters offer opportunities to explore pro-social behaviour. In Knuffle Bunny, a family\u2019s trip to the laundromat leads to mapping their way through the neighbourhood and exploring how faces and body language express how people feel. In the streetscape depicted, your child may recognize what early childhood educators talk about as environmental print \u2014 signs, labels and logos visible in our everyday world. Children\u2019s early curiosity about text and signs all around them is part of a first stage of reading awareness. They will begin to read the environmental print as they recognize shapes, colours, numbers and letters.\n\n2. Not a Box\n\n(HarperCollins)\n\nBy Antoinette Portis (2006, HarperCollins)\n\nChildren see beauty in the items that adults might otherwise discard. In a time when it is necessary to encourage environmental sustainability and ecological understandings, what\u2019s stopping us from slowing down and offering some otherwise recyclable materials like boxes and other found materials to become robots, wands, puppets, tents and playhouses? Not a Box invites predicting what\u2019s next and chiming in with each page as your child imagines \u201cIt\u2019s not a box, it\u2019s a \u2026\u201d\n\n3. Lost in the Woods\n\n(Carl R. Sams II Photography)\n\nBy Carl R. Sams II and Jean Stoick (2005, Carl R. Sams II Photography)\n\nChildren can imagine themselves in other places and spaces sparked by rich illustrations in picture books.

My Heart Fills With Happiness\n\nBy Monique Gray Smith (2018, Orca Book Publishers)\n\n(Orca Book Publshers)\n\nThis book, by an author of Cree, Lakota and Scottish ancestry, is also available in a bilingual Plains Cree edition, Ni S\u00e2kaskineh M\u00eeyaw\u00e2ten Niteh Ohcih translated by Mary Cardinal Collins. It offers a wonderful opportunity to talk about emotions as it explores the concept of what makes people happy and how people express joy in different ways. The author narrates moments such as the smell of warm bannock, providing opportunities to discuss distinct aspects of Indigenous cultures or histories, as well as the similarities children and families share.\n\n5. Changes, Changes\n\nBy Pat Hutchins (1971, Aladdin)\n\n(Aladdin)\n\nA timeless, wordless book, Changes, Changes invites children to explore how building blocks and little figures can be used to tell endless stories.

Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed\n\n(Clarion Books)\n\nBy Eileen Christelow (1989, Clarion Books)\n\nBooks that invite children to sing, dance and do actions with favourite childhood songs or chants are always popular.
