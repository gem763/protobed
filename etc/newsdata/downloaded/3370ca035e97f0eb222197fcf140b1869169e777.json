I stopped by the room of a woman in her late 80s with dementia. Her ability to swallow \u2014 to ensure that food and water and saliva reached her stomach and not her lungs \u2014 had grown tenuous: This was her third bout of pneumonia in as many months. After restricting her diet for fear of worsening her breathing, her family had now decided that she should enjoy what she could in the time she had left.\n\n\u201cDry,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d I asked, leaning closer.\n\n\u201cMy mouth. So dry,\u201d she repeated. I noticed her cracked lips, the miscellaneous debris crusting around her mouth.\n\nA cup of ice cubes sat enticingly on the table near her bed, just out of reach. I helped her sit forward. I placed one cube in her mouth. And I watched, as a smile spread across her face.\n\nI thought, chagrined, of how, in all likelihood, I wouldn\u2019t spend the next week sitting with patients \u2014 exploring what they want, understanding the toll that illness exacts on their lives. I\u2019d spend it staring at screens, ordering tests, devising diagnostic plans. I wondered whether, as physicians, we focus too narrowly on the treatments we\u2019re trained to provide instead of the more holistic care patients need \u2014 whether too often we fail to bear witness, to support families, to offer ice cubes.\n\nArthur Kleinman thinks so.\n\nIn his new book \u201cThe Soul of Care: The Moral Education of a Husband and a Doctor,\u201d Kleinman \u2014 a psychiatrist and anthropologist at Harvard \u2014 chronicles the harrowing decade he spent caring for his wife, Joan, after she was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease in her 50s.\n\nHe describes the process of navigating a health-care system that seemed to offer plenty of clinical care but little compassionate care as she declined from a lively, witty Sinologist to a woman unable to see, dress herself or recognize loved ones. In moving detail, Kleinman tells the story of a husband trying to honor, in the best way he could, his wife\u2019s ultimate wish: \u201cI will not die without dignity.\u201d\n\nThe book opens with a fearful and disoriented Joan, years into her decline, screaming at Kleinman, unable to recognize her husband or the home they\u2019ve lived in for nearly three decades. To Kleinman, the pain of his wife\u2019s angst is amplified by the recognition that their bond, which had deepened over a half-century, seemed to have shattered in an instant: To Joan, he was now a strange man in her room \u2014 not someone she had loved and supported her entire life.\n\nFor many caregivers, the pain of losing a loved one\u2019s companionship is compounded by many financial and health burdens. Family caregivers are often forced to reduce the number of hours they work and can lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages over their lifetimes, resulting in considerable financial strain.\n\nThe physical and mental strain, however, is often worse. Caregivers are at substantial risk for anxiety, depression and chronic disease. Research suggests that high levels of inflammation and depressive symptoms can last for years after their caregiving responsibilities have ended. One study found that compared with non-caregivers, people who experienced significant stress while caring for a disabled spouse were 63 percent more likely to die in the next four years.\n\nKleinman emphasizes how the daily act of caregiving took a toll on him and how he felt unsupported by the medical system. He and Joan felt they were treated as \u201clittle more than inconclusive test results and data points, rather than vulnerable people in need of support and desperate for reassurance.\u201d\n\nThe Western model of medicine tends to understand the patient as an atomized figure, the lone sufferer of illness and disease. But patients are often embedded in a complex network of friends and family members \u2014 each of whom may play a role in the caregiving process.\n\nThere\u2019s more that clinicians can do to recognize this reality. A first step is simply to identify the patient\u2019s primary caregiver and list them in the medical record. This allows clinicians to more reliably explore caregivers\u2019 unique circumstances and concerns, and ensures that confusion about health-care privacy laws doesn\u2019t limit the loved one\u2019s ability to engage in the patient\u2019s medical care.\n\nClinicians should also help caregivers gain proficiency in the many tasks \u2014 changing catheters, dressing wounds, checking blood sugar levels \u2014 they may need to provide. Too often, we assume caregivers can perform these complicated medical tasks without taking the time to help them learn.\n\nAnd all caregivers should be made aware of available community resources such as peer support groups, meal delivery services and respite programs. The Eldercare Locator is a free national service that helps caregivers find such resources, with the goal of allowing older adults to continue living at home.\n\nFor Kleinman, as for many caregivers, frustration with the health-care system was aggravated by his budding social isolation. Friends and neighbors, increasingly uncomfortable with Joan\u2019s disabilities, began to view her as \u201csocially dead, a nonperson\u201d\u2014 and stopped extending invitations to social events.\n\nKleinman recalls one particularly painful evening when he took Joan to the opera. During the performance, she began speaking loudly, and audience members hissed complaints at them, urging them to leave. Kleinman is torn between their admonitions for silence and Joan\u2019s thrill upon hearing the music: \u201cDidn\u2019t she deserve some happiness in the midst of the horror of her disease?\u201d\n\nStill, Kleinman\u2019s ultimate message is a hopeful one: that the act of caring can transform both caregiver and care recipient. He emphasizes the uniqueness of each family\u2019s situation and shuns dogma suggesting there is one proper way to cope.\n\nHe shows us how the humblest actions can also be the most profound: soothing a frightened loved one, wiping a tear, changing a soiled sheet. There are beautiful moments \u2014 even beautiful days \u2014 amid the inevitable decline.\n\nDespite unrelenting challenges, many caregivers feel fulfilled, even enriched, by the act of caring for a loved one. Clinicians can and should work with caregivers to ease what\u2019s burdensome and preserve what\u2019s beautiful in caregiving.\n\nIn the end, this is the story that may offer instruction and comfort to the 40 million family caregivers in the United States, and inspiration to clinicians struggling to go beyond diagnosis and treatment \u2014 to provide care.\n\nDhruv Khullar (@DhruvKhullar) is a physician and an assistant professor of health-care policy and hospital medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, and director of policy dissemination at the Physicians Foundation Center for the Study of Physician Practice and Leadership.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Big Number: 20 million caregivers perform complex medical and nursing tasks\n\nCompassion fatigue hits not only professional caregivers.
