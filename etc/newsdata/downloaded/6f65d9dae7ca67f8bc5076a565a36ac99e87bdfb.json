[L2N27E0HA]\n\nHBO did not say when \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d would become available.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hollywood publications reported that HBO had scrapped plans for a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel starring Naomi Watts. A source familiar with the decision confirmed the reports were accurate.\n\nThe reason for the decision was unclear.\n\nA pilot, or first episode, for the show, was shot in Northern Ireland earlier this year. The story was set thousands of years before the events covered in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nCasey Bloys, president of programming at HBO, had told reporters in July after filming finished on the pilot episode that he was pleased with what he had seen.\n\n\u201cIt looks really good. The cast was amazing,\u201d Bloys said at a Television Critics Association event in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe final season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d won 12 Emmy awards, including the top prize of best drama series, in September.\n\nThe pilot for the prequel was one of several \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-related projects that were put into development at HBO prior to the end of the series.", "description": "HBO ordered 10 episodes of a \"Game of Thrones\" spinoff called \"House of the Dragon,\" the network said on Tuesday, shortly after reports emerged that the premium cable channel had nixed another series set in the world created by author George R.R.
