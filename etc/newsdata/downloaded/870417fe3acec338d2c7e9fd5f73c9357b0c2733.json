They were there to protest a hearing where Britney Spears\u2019 father, Jamie, was scheduled to appear\u2014a man they believe coerced and manipulated the 37-year-old Grammy-award-winning pop star into a legal conservatorship that\u2019s lasted 11 years.\n\n\u201cBritney Spears inspired me to take my first dance class,\u201d said Simon Schuh, a freckly dance major at USC. \u201cI watched her video \u2018Me Against the Music\u2019 at age five, when it came out, and I was blown away. I took my first ballet class after that. Ever since then I\u2019ve been following her career and kind of honing in on her every move. She not only inspired me to dance but come out as gay and just be myself, and unfortunately, she can\u2019t be herself under this conservatorship.\u201d\n\nA conservatorship is a court-supervised process whereby the court appoints a third party to be in charge of the health and financial affairs of another person\u2014typically an older person no longer able to care for themselves or someone with severe disabilities. Spears has been in a conservatorship since 2008 after a bout of erratic behavior: shaving her head, driving with a baby in her lap, losing custody of her kids, entering a psych ward twice, repeatedly speaking in a British accent. Her conservatorship is unusual because Spears is young, has continued working full-time, and is worth nearly $60 million, according to court records from 2018.\n\nWednesday, the people involved in that conservatorship, including Spears\u2019 father, his legal team, Spears\u2019 mother Lynne, her legal team, Spears\u2019 temporary conservator, and her court-appointed counsel, met before Judge Brenda J. Penny to discuss the singer\u2019s children, business information, and health concerns. The courtroom was cleared before the hearing began in earnest, and a minute order from the proceedings revealed little of what it involved. But before the courtroom was closed, Spears\u2019 court-appointed lawyer mentioned that he intended to discuss the singer\u2019s 730 evaluation\u2014a parental competence examination that was ordered by Judge Penny at a hearing in May. Outside, protesters chanted with ambiguous irony: \u201cWhat do we want? Free Britney! When do we want it? Now!\u201d\n\nThe hearing also comes on the heels of a restraining order filed in August against Spears\u2019 father for allegedly abusing one of the singer\u2019s kids. Yesterday, Ventura County prosecutors announced they would not be pressing charges.\n\n\u201cI think the key thing here is that conservatorships are supposed to be for people who are gravely disabled,\u201d said Tess Barker, a young blonde woman in a green polo dress who helped found the #FreeBritney movement. \u201cI have a family member that is minor but will have to be conserved when he\u2019s 18 because of a mental issue. But what we see from Britney Spears publicly is that she\u2019s able to learn complicated choreography, tour the world, have a Vegas residency, release several albums, be a judge on a reality show. None of those things are in line with what I think of when I think of a gravely disabled person.\u201d\n\n\u201c I went to Britney\u2019s mother\u2019s Instagram, and I wrote, \u2018Give Britney back her freedom, her voice and her life.\u2019 And Britney\u2019s mom liked my comment\u2014with the hashtag #FreeBritney, by the way. That\u2019s when I was like, \u2018Oh, okay, whoa. There\u2019s more to this than what they are saying.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe #FreeBritney movement emerged out of a podcast called Britney\u2019s Gram, hosted by Barker and her co-host, L.A. comedian Barbara Gray. They started the show as a lighthearted bit unpacking the pop star\u2019s Instagram. But after a series of slightly unusual developments over the past year, the pair began digging into the terms of the conservatorship.\n\nThe first came in late 2018, when one of Britney\u2019s two conservators, Andrew Wallet (the other being her father), filed a motion with the court requesting a substantial raise. His rationale: the singer\u2019s increased income had added responsibility. He called the conservatorship, as #FreeBritney proponents like to quote, a \u201chybrid business model.\u201d The court granted a salary increase to $426,000 a year. Second, in January, the singer put her Las Vegas residency, Domination\u2014set to start in February\u2014on an \u201cindefinite hiatus.\u201d Third, in March, Wallet resigned, insisting that the conservatorship had several business activities requiring \u201cimmediate attention.\u201d He warned that if his notice was not accepted \u201cimmediately and without delay,\u201d then \u201csubstantial detriment, irreparable harm and immediate danger\u201d would befall the singer. Last, in April it was reported that Spears had been checked into a mental institution. That same month, Barker and Gray uploaded a \u201cspecial emergency episode\u201d in which they play a voicemail left on their hotline from a paralegal who worked with an attorney involved in Spears\u2019 conservatorship. He told them they \u201cwere onto something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is happening is disturbing, to say the least,\u201d the anonymous voice claimed. \u201cBasically, Britney was in rehearsals for Domination. It came to Jamie\u2019s attention that Britney was not taking her medication as prescribed. She was missing a lot of doses and just full-on not taking them. So they got her to the doctor and the doctor said, \u2018OK, if you don\u2019t want these medications, let\u2019s get you on a new one.\u2019 She refused to take the new one. Jamie said, \u2018Either you take this medication or the show\u2019s off, and I\u2019m pulling my support and you can\u2019t do it.\u2019 Britney did not follow Jamie\u2019s instructions, so he was true to his word\u2014he pulled the show, he verbatim said, \u2018Blame it on my illness.\u2019 He even claimed that Britney did not willingly enter the wellness facility.\u201d\n\nThe episode went viral; the hashtag was trending on Twitter within hours. Six days later, fans organized a protest outside West Hollywood City Hall. It snowballed from there. In June, Spears\u2019 father sued a #FreeBritney blogger, Anthony Elia, for defamation.\u201cI first heard about #FreeBritney back in April, when the podcast dropped\u2014the one with the voicemail,\u201d said Junior Olivas, one of the protest organizers who has been involved since April. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, something\u2019s fishy here\u2019... I went to Britney\u2019s mother\u2019s Instagram, and I wrote, \u2018Give Britney back her freedom, her voice and her life.\u2019 And Britney\u2019s mom liked my comment\u2014with the hashtag #FreeBritney, by the way. That\u2019s when I was like, \u2018Oh, OK, whoa. There\u2019s more to this than what they are saying.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the protest on Wednesday, participants came armed with stickers, buttons, and giant fliers outlining their case. Some claims are more factual than others. They allege that Spears was denied the right to hire her own attorney. That\u2019s true\u2014in 2008, Spears tried twice to hire an outside lawyer; her court-appointed counsel deemed her unfit to hire her own representative. But the flier also claims that \u201cmultiple psychiatrists have determined the conservatorship to be unnecessary\u201d (due to HIPA protections, none of Spears\u2019 medical records have been released), and that \u201cfinancial statements show evidence of money laundering\u201d (in a separate 2009 case, a lawyer Spears had attempted to hire made claims of theft, but was never legally involved in the conservatorship and did not furnish evidence of his allegations in court).\n\nAccording to Olivas, a twentysomething guy with a diamond earring and goatee, the rallies are planned in a large group chat on Instagram. Like most of the members, Olivas has been a Spears fan since he was a kid. \u201cSince age 11,\u201d he said. \u201cI traded in my Pokemon cards to one of my cousin\u2019s friends for the ...Baby One More Time album, because I didn\u2019t want to bum from my parents to buy it for me.\u201d\n\nAt one point, an attorney in glasses and a Snoopy tie paused by the display. He introduced himself as Jeff Condon, an estate-planning lawyer who has practiced in Santa Monica for 32 years and specializes in conservatorships, among other things. After checking out the fliers, Condon got into a debate with a protester\u2014a redhead who declined to give her name. \u201cI was just telling this very nice young lady that if Britney is consenting to the conservatorship, and she has counsel and they get together and say, \u2018Yeah, things have been going pretty well, the finances are being handled so she can focus on her career,\u2019 then [there\u2019s no] issue,\u201d Condon said, going on to argue that if Spears wanted out of her conservatorship she could contest it. \u201cI think it would be a tough row to hoe to suggest that she\u2019s being detained to the point that she can\u2019t communicate with the outside world.\u201d", "description": "Pop icon Britney Spears\u2019 father, Jamie, appeared in an LA court Wednesday for a hearing about the pop star\u2019s conservatorship\u2014attracting many #FreeBritney protesters.", "authors": ["Tarpley Hitt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568868823/190918-hitt-brittney-protest-tease_ubbc5u", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
