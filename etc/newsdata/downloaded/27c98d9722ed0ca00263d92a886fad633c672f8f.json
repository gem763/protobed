Dlamini did not at the time specify which Sekunjalo she was referring to \u2013 Sekunjalo Investment Holdings, the umbrella company that houses the assets in the wider group, or Sekunjalo Independent Media, a special purpose vehicle set up in 2013 to buy out Independent Media SA from its Irish owners.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurv\u00e9 previously said Dlamini could only have been referring to Sekunjalo Independent Media, calling her comments \"deceitful\" and \"reckless\". On Wednesday he ratcheted up the pressure by saying that if the PIC did not clarify its statement, his group would institute damage claims against the PIC as well as Dlamini in her personal capacity.\n\n\"While it may be that she mistakenly referred to the one instead of the other, the fact is that it is the Sekunjalo the Group that has been dragged through the media and whose reputation she and de facto the PIC, have significantly tarnished.\"\n\nThe PIC has not publicly commented on which company Dlamini was referring to. It said in a separate media statement on Wednesday that it would not make further public statements until \"any anticipated and real legal proceedings \u2013 of whatever form or manner they may take - are instituted before court\".\n\nIt did not respond to a Fin24 request for comment.\n\nThe asset manager also accused Surv\u00e9 making \"misplaced, opportunistic, flawed and deceitful\" arguments after he claimed in a statement that there were links between the PIC's remarks before Parliament, and a regulatory raid carried out at his Cape Town offices last week in a market abuse inquiry.\n\nThe raid was carried out by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority, which had previously said it was probing AYO in a market abuse investigation.\n\n\"The correct position is that the PIC is not a party to any regulatory investigation by the FSCA into Dr Surv\u00e9 or his business entities that led to last week's search and seizure operation by the FSCA. An attempt to link the PIC\u2019s response and anticipated actions in respect of its investment in Sekunjalo and AYO to last week\u2019s raid at Sekunjalo\u2019s Offices is factually misplaced, opportunistic, flawed and deceitful,\" said the PIC.\n\n* According to Fin24 calculations, companies linked to Surv\u00e9 have received about R5.35bn in funding from the PIC. This includes a R200m investment in Premier Fishing, R4.3bn in AYO, and R850m in Sekunjalo Independent Media. Sagarmatha, also part of the Sekunjalo group, had hoped to receive R3bn from the PIC, but the deal fell through.", "description": "The already-strained relationship between the state asset manager and the Cape Town businessman has worsened.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7941/5f995e1432fa4346a03e733dc26f5741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
