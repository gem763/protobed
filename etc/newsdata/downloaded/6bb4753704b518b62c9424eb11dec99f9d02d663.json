The B-1B, meanwhile, had particularly low mission readiness this year.\n\nVisit Business Insider's home page for more stories.\n\nThe US has three bombers \u2014 the B-1B Lancer, the stealth B-2 Spirit, and the B-52 Stratofortress \u2014 to deliver thousands of tons of firepower in combat.\n\nSome form of the B-52 has been in use since 1955. The B-1B took its first flight in 1974, and the B-2 celebrated its 30th year in the skies in 2019. A new stealth bomber, the B-21, is in production and is expected to fly in December 2021, although details about it are scarce.\n\nThe US Air Force has been conducting missions in Europe with B-52s and B-2s in order to project dominance against Russia and train with NATO partners, but the bomber fleet has faced problems. The B-1B fleet struggled with low readiness rates, as Air Force Times reported in June, likely due to its age and overuse in recent conflicts.\n\nHere are all the bombers in the US Air Force's fleet.", "description": "From the venerable B-52 to the future B-21, the US leads the way in firepower and stealth technology.
