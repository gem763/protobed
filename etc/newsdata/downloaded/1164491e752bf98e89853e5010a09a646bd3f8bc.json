(Kristen Norman/Chicago Tribune/TNS via Getty Images)\n\nThe Summer of White Claw has come to an end, and with it comes foreboding news: There is a shortage of America's favorite hard seltzer.\n\nSanjiv Gajiwala, White Claw's senior vice president of marketing, confirmed to CNN that there is a nationwide shortage of the hard seltzer industry leader, which has become so popular that their sales spiked nearly 300 percent over the summer compared to their sales last year. In July alone, White Claws brought in $327.7 million dollars.\n\nGajiwala, in part, blamed the drink's own popularity for the shortage.\n\n\"White Claw has accelerated faster than anyone could have predicted,\" he said.\n\nNaturally, fans of the beverage, who have proclaimed all summer long that there \"ain't no laws when you're drinking Claws,\" are distraught.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\nThere's a White Claw shortage.

The company is \"allocating product to our distributor partners to keep all markets in stock the best we can and will continue to do so until we get back to our normal safety stock position.\"\n\nGajiwala added: \"We are working around the clock to increase supply given the rapid growth in consumer demand.\u201d\n\nUntil then, people hoping to get tipsy on a drink that has fewer calories and less sugar than other traditional go-to alcoholic beverages can turn to one of White Claws' many competitors, such as Truly or Natural Light's hard seltzer. For drinkers who want more punch to their hard seltzer, however, they'll have to wait until 2020 to purchase Four Loko's version of the beverage, which has an unprecedented 14 percent ABV (alcohol by volume).\n\nWhite Claw did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "White Claw hard seltzer has confirmed that there is a nationwide shortage of their popular beverage.
