When I saw the game, I thought that's him out until next international break because we've had some long-term muscle injuries but it's not as bad as feared.\"\n\n(Image: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\n(Image: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\nSergio Romero would come in if De Gea misses out on Sunday, when United will look to kickstart their campaign.\n\nSolskjaer's side have endured the club's worst start to a season in 30 years, but executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has reiterated his support of the under-fire manager.\n\n\"I speak to Ed loads of times and we speak regularly,\" Solskjaer said.\n\n(Image: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\n(Image: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\n\"As we've spoken about so many times, we do have a plan and we know that we've made some decisions that maybe in the short-term would harm us, but we know in the long-term will benefit us. And that's part of the plan.\n\n\"But results are always are always the main thing and we can move forward quicker if we get results and performances.\n\n\"But I'm sure we will get there. It's just still planning for the next transfer window, summer transfer window and how we see the team moving forward.\"", "description": "Manchester United go head-to-head with fierce rivals Liverpool in the Premier League this weekend", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Eamonn", "James Clarke"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647215.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-ECE_07_MAN_UNITED_FRIDAY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
