In 2004, the number of centenarians exceeded 500 and grew beyond 1,000 in 2011. That number surpassed 2,500 for the first time by the end of last year.\n\nThe increasing figures reflect continuously elevating living standards and medical and health services as the city strives to build itself into a world-class healthy city by 2030.\n\nThe municipality unveiled 100 new measures in late August to further improve public health levels. More medical resources will be poured into prevention, early detection and treatment of chronic diseases that affect residents' health, said Zong Ming, vice-mayor of Shanghai.\n\n\"We hope to reach the point where at least 40 percent of all cancer diagnoses are detected early,\" she said.\n\nShanghai Health Commission said that the average life expectancy of permanent residents in the city reached 83.6 years in 2018, compared with the national average of 77. The figure in Shanghai almost equaled Japan's 83.7, the world's highest.\n\nA string of measures have been introduced in Shanghai to provide better elderly care. For example, more than 100 respite care centers, which strive to support the growing number of families caring for elderly while family size is shrinking, have been opened since 2015.\n\nResidents can use the facilities for as little as a few hours or for up to three months, with prices ranging from 35 yuan ($5) for basic day care items, such as assisted showers, to 160 yuan a night for a bed and three meals a day.\n\nZhang Haixiang-deputy director of civil affairs in Jing'an, the city district with the highest percentage of senior residents-said such establishments have proved popular among the elderly and their children as seniors can enjoy professional services without leaving their community. The preference among seniors to spend their twilight years in their own homes has not been compromised.\n\nLatest official data showed the municipality had about 5 million permanent residents aged 60 or older, accounting for 34 percent of the city's population, compared with 17.9 percent nationally. Beijing, the city with the second oldest population domestically, had 3.33 million residents aged 60 and above.", "description": "The number of centenarians in Shanghai reached 2,657 by the end of September-a record high in the city with the nation's oldest population-and the uptrend may continue, the municipal civil affairs bureau said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/08/5d9be977a310cf3e97a00254.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
