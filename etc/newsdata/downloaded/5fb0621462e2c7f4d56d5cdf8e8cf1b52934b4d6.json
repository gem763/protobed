Welcome Lishivha shares tips on how to be more inclusive with your language.\n\nWhen it comes to pronouns used to refer to people, a lot of English speakers seem limited to the gender binary of him/her and he/she, often leading folks to make incorrect and sometimes harmful assumptions about people\u2019s genders.\n\n\n\nThe rise in the visibility and voice of women and the LGTBIQ community has brought to the fore the scrutiny of gendered pronouns.\n\nGender-neutral pronouns create room for awareness about gender non-binary and agender folks, moving away from \u201che\u201d as the default pronoun and recognising the spectrum of gender.\n\nA recent study by Washington University found that using gender-neutral pronouns reduces mental biases that favour men and boosts positive feelings towards women and LGBTIQ people.\n\nIn addition to creating awareness and avoiding embarrassing encounters of mis-gendering people, it\u2019s important to remember that gender references are not important in our use of language as far as communicating our ideas and meanings are concerned.\n\nThe reference to one\u2019s gender is almost always secondary and insignificant when communicating with people.\n\nAnd if you find yourself seriously wanting to assign a binary gender in your speech, you probably belong to a special part of the population that is invested in reinforcing limited gender norms.\n\nYou would be better off concerning yourself with your message more than you do the gender.\n\nConversations about using gender-neutral terms might have gained prominence in the past few years, but the spectrum of gender is not new. It\u2019s as old as the human race.\n\nBy adopting gender-neutral pronouns, we allow our language to reflect the diversity of the human race. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. Use the singular pronoun \u2018they\u2019 instead of he/she\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the use of the singular pronoun \u201cthey\u201d dates as far back as 1375 in the medieval romance William and the Werewolf.\n\nSome linguists have challenged the use of \u201cthey\u201d, saying you can\u2019t use a plural noun to a singular antecedent.\n\nThe critics forgot that they have probably used \u201cyou\u201d to refer tomore than one person.\n\nAmerica\u2019s oldest dictionary, the Merriam-Webster recently added \u201cthey\u201d as a non-binary pronoun to its online dictionary.\n\nThere have been attempts to adopt other pronouns such as \u201cze\u201d and \u201czir\u201d and \u201chir\u201d which haven\u2019t gained as much prominence as \u201cthey\u201d.\n\nFor now, \u201cthey\u201d is the leading pronoun in the quest against gendered pronouns.\n\nIn many of the South African languages we refer to elders in the plural \u201cthey\u201d as a sign of respect.\n\nThe same principle is applied when using \u201cthey\u201d as singular in English.\n\n2. Use \u2018one\u2019\n\nThe idea of using \u201che\u201d and \u201che/she\u201d as default to refer to an unknown person is an ancient one. The singular third-person pronoun \u201cone\u201d, considered by some to be an impersonal pronoun, is also a gender-neutral term that breaks away from the deeply gendering nature of the English language.\n\n3. Instead of \u2018ladies and gentlemen\u2019 use gentlefolk\n\nI can\u2019t remember the number of times I\u2019ve had cringeworthy moments, knowing there were non-binary individuals in a room when an emcee opened proceedings with \u201cladies and gentlemen\u201d. The ancient salutation is increasingly scrutinised and is slowly becoming a thing of the past as more people come to realise there are other genders. Besides, gentlefolk makes you sound witty.\n\n4. Stay away from \u2018guys\u2019\n\nMany people use \u201cguys\u201d loosely to refer to a group of people. I know many people who earnestly say \u201cguys\u201d to refer to people generally but could not honestly refer to a woman or a non-binary person as a \u201cguy\u201d in the singular. Instead of \u201chi guys\u201d, say \u201chi folks\u201d.\n\n5. If you ever ask, ask appropriately\n\nIf you really have to ask what people\u2019s pronouns are (note that I didn\u2019t use \u201cpreferred pronouns\u201d), you must first consider why it matters and then you must consider their safety. Is it safe for them to possibly come out as non-binary, trans or gender non-conforming? There is something about \u201cpreferred\u201d that implies choice when there might be none. Besides, most of the time, this is none of your business.\n\n6. Use people\u2019s names\n\nVery often we revert to pronouns when we don\u2019t know people\u2019s names or how to pronounce them. Learning to say people\u2019s names correctly is as important as using the correct pronouns to refer to them. Even in our correct use of pronouns, let\u2019s not forget the age-old saying that a person\u2019s name is to that person the sweetest sound.\n\n7. Stand up against misgendering\n\nIf you know someone is gender non-binary and someone refers to them incorrectly in a conversation, take a moment to say \u201ctheir pronoun is they, not he/she\u201d. This will contribute towards building an inclusive everyday language.\n\n8. Use the honorific Mx\n\nDeveloped in the late 1970s, the honorific Mx (pronounced mix) is used by gender non-binary folks and people who prefer to conceal their identity for a variety of reasons (including gender bias). The honorific is recognised by all the major English dictionaries.\n\n9. Avoid gendered nouns\n\nLearn to replace words, such as waitress, actress, barman, chairman and mankind. Use waiter, actor, bartender, chairperson and humankind instead.", "description": "Help usher the English language into the 21st century by adopting gender-neutral pronouns as part of your everyday language.
