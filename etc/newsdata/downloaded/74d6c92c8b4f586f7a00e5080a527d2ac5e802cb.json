There is no Michael Pollan of sound; limiting your noise intake has none of the cachet of going paleo or doing a cleanse. When The New Yorker recently proposed noise pollution as the next public-health crisis, the internet scoffed. \u201cPollution pollution is the next big (and current) public health crisis,\u201d chided one commenter. Noise is treated less as a health risk than an aesthetic nuisance\u2014a cause for people who, in between rounds of golf and art openings, fuss over the leaf blowers outside their vacation homes. Complaining about noise elicits eye rolls. Nothing will get you labeled a crank faster.\n\nScientists have known for decades that noise\u2014even at the seemingly innocuous volume of car traffic\u2014is bad for us. \u201cCalling noise a nuisance is like calling smog an inconvenience,\u201d former U.S. Surgeon General William Stewart said in 1978. In the years since, numerous studies have only underscored his assertion that noise \u201cmust be considered a hazard to the health of people everywhere.\u201d Say you\u2019re trying to fall asleep. You may think you\u2019ve tuned out the grumble of trucks downshifting outside, but your body has not: Your adrenal glands are pumping stress hormones, your blood pressure and heart rate are rising, your digestion is slowing down. Your brain continues to process sounds while you snooze, and your blood pressure spikes in response to clatter as low as 33 decibels\u2014slightly louder than a purring cat.\n\nExperts say your body does not adapt to noise. Large-scale studies show that if the din keeps up\u2014over days, months, years\u2014noise exposure increases your risk of high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, and heart attacks, as well as strokes, diabetes, dementia, and depression. Children suffer not only physically\u201418 months after a new airport opened in Munich, the blood pressure and stress-hormone levels of neighboring children soared\u2014but also behaviorally and cognitively. A landmark study published in 1975 found that the reading scores of sixth graders whose classroom faced a clattering subway track lagged nearly a year behind those of students in quieter classrooms\u2014a difference that disappeared once soundproofing materials were installed. Noise might also make us mean: A 1969 study suggested that test subjects exposed to noise, even the gentle fuzz of white noise, become more aggressive and more eager to zap fellow subjects with electric shocks.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bianca Bosker", "Theatlantic.Com Magazine Archive The-End-Of-Silence"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
