There were no \u2018last seen,\u2019 there were no blue ticks, and, consequently, there was no stress over whether you were being ignored by someone else.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s no surprise that one would feel bad if their loved ones didn\u2019t respond to them. However, there is a heartbreak more painful than this one and it is when your cab driver ghosts you.\n\nIf you are privileged enough to not know what I\u2019m talking about, you can turn back now. But if you live in the world of \u201cBhaiya, location pe aa jao\u201d and \u20185 star ratings,' you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nGetting ghosted by your cab driver not only hurts you but is an extremely inconvenient experience to have.\n\nThe only difference between getting ghosted by a guy/girl and a cab driver is that at least you can find another cab instantly. Oh wait, thanks to online dating apps, we can do the same with dates too now. My bad.\n\nHow bad is it?\n\nApart from all that, there is nothing pleasant about being ditched by your cab driver.\n\nPicture this: Your phone has 5 per cent battery and it's at 2:00am. You\u2019re in unfamiliar territory and you book a cab. The app shows that the driver is just five minutes away. You thank your stars and move on to the pick-up spot.\n\nJust a minute before the driver is about to reach, he calls and asks where you intend to go. Even though you know what\u2019s coming, you mumble the name of the location which is really far from your present one. On the other end, the driver tells you he\u2019s almost there but you know it in your heart that he won\u2019t show up. Your phone is now on 3 per cent and the app shows you that they\u2019re trying to find another cab for you.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like cabbies have a fear of commitment. The moment you talk about going the long way, they decide to block you. In this case, they literally cancel you. Matlab, agar nahi jana toh bata do na. Don\u2019t raise our hopes by saying, \u201cHaan, bas aa gaya\" and vanish into thin air.\n\nI have personally been ghosted by cab drivers so often--no, I\u2019m not kidding--that I\u2019d rather have a heartbreak than be stranded on the road.\n\nThere have been times when I\u2019ve justified the driver\u2019s behaviour and told myself that maybe my destination is really out of his way. But what do you do when your drop location isn\u2019t even that far and your driver still chooses to tell you to fuck off?\n\nOnce, I added a stop during my journey and like the good person I am, I made sure that the stop is on the way to my destination and the driver doesn\u2019t have to make a detour. Politely, I asked him to accept the update and make a stop for a minute.\n\nThe app specifically tells you that it is acceptable to make a stop for three minutes and less. It\u2019s a goddamn feature of the service I\u2019m using. For some reason, he didn\u2019t accept the change and stopped at the location I had added. I told him I\u2019ll be right back and before anyone could count to hundred, I returned to the spot he was supposedly waiting for me.\n\nGuess what? I saw no cab there, only a fool. A fool who had to book another cab to get to a location which was just five minutes away now. The asshole just bounced without telling me. Matlab agar takleef hai, toh bata do na. It personally pisses me off when they behave like it\u2019s okay and then ditch you.\n\nIf I\u2019m booking a cab in the morning to get to work and the driver calls me up to confirm the booking (we all know it\u2019s just a trick to find out the destination) and tells me he\u2019s on his way, I expect him to show up. Cab drivers need to stop playing with our emotions and telling us that they\u2019ll be right there, when in reality, they have no plans of ever meeting us.\n\nWhat can you even do?\n\nFile a complaint with the app and expect them to get back to you. We all know how inconsequential that is and you\u2019d rather just book another cab. But then you stop and wonder to yourself that if no one ever brings this up, cab drivers are going to continue to ghost people. No wonder millennials are never on time. Their hearts are hurting due to being left on read by their latest crush and they can\u2019t reach work on time because their cabbies are ghosting them. Is the universe always working against us?\n\nWhy are cab drivers who cancel the trip like pregnancy scares? Because they make us late. \u2014 Aishwarya Dharni (@aishdharni) October 14, 2019\n\nDo you have cab ghosting stories too?
