But you know, as I said, I want to try and knock the wall down a little bit, so I will be trying to go and see him.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["John Cope", "Head Of Education", "Skills Policy At Cbi", "Nick Duffy", "Emma Powys Maurice", "Josh Milton", "Shannon Power", "Patrick Kelleher"], "top_image": "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sir-Elton-John.jpg", "published_at": "2016-02-02"}
