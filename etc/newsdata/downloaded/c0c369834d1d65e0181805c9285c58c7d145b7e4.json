It will cost a little more than a Quarter Pounder at $6.49 plus tax.\n\nThe burger will be available for 12 weeks, in 28 stores in and around London, Ont., starting on Sept. 30.\n\nPlans for the launch have been shrouded in secrecy.\n\nDuring a preview presentation for the Financial Post at McDonald\u2019s Canadian office in Toronto earlier this month, the test kitchen \u2014 which operates as a functioning McDonald\u2019s restaurant for the 363 staff at the Canadian office \u2014 was closed while Jeff Anderson, a senior manager in culinary innovation known around the Toronto headquarters as Chef Jeff, prepared PLTs.\n\nMany employees at the office still didn\u2019t know about the new product, and the few who did were worried about leaks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty tight group,\u201d said Michaela Charette, head of consumer insights for McDonald\u2019s Canada.\n\nA diagram of the PLT, taped up in the test kitchen, was labeled \u201cProject Dune Ops Test\u201d but was later removed by a staff member.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s officials would not explain the code name.\n\nThe sandwich was developed at McDonald\u2019s global headquarters in Chicago, with the Canadian operation only responsible for the rolling out the test in the London, Ont., region.\n\nHead office picked Southwestern Ontario because it more or less looks like a North American every town \u2014 or in the parlance of one McDonald\u2019s spokesman, because it has \u201cgeographic and representative spreads that we can take and measure against other demographics.\u201d\n\nCharette added that other draws were the Canadian market\u2019s diversity, and its familiarity with plant-based products.\n\nMore than a year ago, A&W Canada stirred up interest in plant-based products after the launch of its own Beyond Meat sandwich \u2014 a major milestone for Beyond Meat, which until that point had yet to launch with a large fast-food chain. Since then, Beyond Meat has vaulted the meat substitute industry into the global spotlight, with its explosive stock market debut and a series of product launches with major chains.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s wouldn\u2019t say how long it\u2019s been working on developing the patty with the Los Angeles-based company. In recent months, the absence of a plant-based option on the McDonald\u2019s menu was starting to raise eyebrows, since a slew of competing fast-food chains \u2014 A&W, Burger King, even Tim Hortons \u2014 had experimented with versions of their own.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m curious,\u201d JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said on a call with Beyond Meat\u2019s executives following the company\u2019s quarterly report in July.\n\n\u201cDoes it surprise you at this point \u2014 with so much evidence that consumers are willing to pay for this \u2026 that at least one of those huge (quick-service restaurants) is still on the sideline?\u201d\n\nBeyond Meat\u2019s chief financial officer, Mark Nelson, stuck up for the unnamed fast-food giant.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s a function of just the size and complexity of some of the largest, most global QSRs out there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to figure out how to integrate into their menu in their operations.\u201d\n\nMichael Gonda, McDonald\u2019s vice president of global communications, told the Financial Post that the menu team worked with the Beyond Meat team to develop the patty recipe, with seasoning that delivered a \u201cvery iconic taste.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat takes a tremendous amount of effort, to create something with specialness,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created something that\u2019s exclusively by us and for us. And that takes a lot of time.\u201d\n\nThe Beyond Meat patties will each be cooked 120 seconds on the restaurants\u2019 clamshell grills \u2014 the same grills McDonald\u2019s uses to grill beef burgers, chicken and eggs.\n\nWe've created something that\u2019s exclusively by us and for us. And that takes a lot of time Michael Gonda, McDonald\u2019s vice president of global communications\n\nGonda said McDonald\u2019s is being intentionally transparent about that fact during the test, to elicit feedback and get a sense of whether it will impact the sandwich\u2019s appeal to vegetarians.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of what this test allows us to understand,\u201d he said.\n\nThe burger will be sold in London, Aylmer, Exeter, Ingersoll, Sarnia, St. Thomas, Strathroy, Tillsonburg and Woodstock. McDonald\u2019s said it didn\u2019t have plans for a larger rollout, since that will be dependent on the results of the Southwestern Ontario test.", "description": "But the new PLT sandwich will only be available in select locations \u2014 for now", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/mcd1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
