But AT&T and WarnerMedia executives intend to play up why they believe they deserve a seat at a table that also includes Apple Inc, Walt Disney Co and Amazon.com.\n\nWarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey, who was recently elevated to the role of chief operating officer of all of AT&T in a sign of just how critical the performance of HBO Max is to the company took the stage to discuss how the company's portfolio of businesses in programming, communications, distribution and marketing contributed to the making of HBO Max.\n\nThis month Stankey told Reuters that HBO Max will be available this spring to 10 million current AT&T customers in the United States -- a mix of wireless, satellite TV, and some HBO Now subscribers -- at no extra charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nNOT WALMART\n\nFrom Stage 21 on the Warner Brothers Studio lot in Burbank, California, executives demonstrated the breadth of new original programming and the depth of WarnerMedia\u2019s extensive library of films and TV series. They included the entire collection of DC Universe superhero film franchises from the last decade such as \"Batman\" and recent box office hits such as \"Joker\" that will be available within the first year of its launch. WarnerMedia also secured the U.S. streaming rights to \"South Park.\"\n\nTo court new viewers, WarnerMedia executives said they will introduce 88 original series in 2021, 38 from HBO and 50 under the category it called \"Max Originals\" that will target younger audiences.\n\nExecutives announced a batch of new shows from high-profile producers and directors including \u201cRaised by Wolves\u201d by \u201cAlien\u201d filmmaker Ridley Scott about androids raising human children and \u201cCollege Girls\u201d from comedian, actress and writer Mindy Kaling.\n\nAhead of the presentation, HBO cancelled a much-anticipated prequel to the \"Game of Thrones\" starring Naomi Watts, one source familiar with the matter said, confirming reports in Hollywood media. WarnerMedia executives are expected to make new announcements about \"Game of Thrones\" during the presentation, the source said.\n\nAlthough the Warner Brothers library includes popular content like \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d -- and the HBO brand is known for edgy, high-quality programming -- it does not have the same brand awareness as Pixar, Marvel or Disney properties that will be included in the Disney+ streaming service that is launching on Nov. 12.\n\nAnd as one of the latest entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max will be competing for household dollars that may have already been allocated to rivals.\n\nWarnerMedia is hoping that with HBO Max, it can continue serving HBO\u2019s core over-40 audience, and expand to include younger viewers who may prefer to stream content and do not want to pay for cable.\n\n\"This is a product that's going to be very different from anything else that you've seen in the market so far,\" AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Monday. \"This is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is HBO Max.\"\n\n(Reporting by Helen Coster and Lisa Richwine in Burbank, California; Editing by Kenneth Li and Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "AT&T Inc executives on Tuesday said the company's HBO Max streaming video service will cost $15 per month -- the same price it currently charges for HBO -- when it launches in May 2020, marking an aggressive entry into the streaming wars.
