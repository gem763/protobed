Schiff, California Democrat.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous and unjustifiable to deny us those basic documents, which are critical to our ability to meaningfully prepare for and participate in this investigation,\u201d said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nThe top lawmakers from all three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry \u2014 the intelligence, oversight and foreign affairs panels \u2014 have sounded alarms about Democrats skewing the process to edge out Republican members.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight and Reform Committee, said that typically when committees conduct closed-door depositions, the chairmen and ranking members each receive a copy of the transcribed interview.\n\nThat isn\u2019t happening in the impeachment inquiry, he said.\n\nThis month, members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee were told they could not participate in what a senior committee aide called a \u201croutine weapons briefing\u201d about a purchase made by the government of Ukraine because it might have been tied to the military aid package to the country that was withheld unless its president agreed to investigate the role of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s son Hunter in a Ukrainian natural gas company.\n\nHouse and Senate committee members hit back at the move and claimed the specific weapons deal in the briefing was not tied to the military aid because it was instead purchased by the Ukraine government, according to the aide.\n\nThe House members were ultimately allowed in the briefing, but the latest letter signals a shift in cooperation efforts between the committees to conduct the inquiry.\n\nRepublicans on the Intelligence Committee said Democrats aren\u2019t properly uploading documents, including letters to White House counsel and other administration officials, to a repository, \u201cthus withholding the existence of such documents from the minority.\u201d\n\nTexas Republican Rep. Will Hurd, who serves on the intelligence panel, said he hasn\u2019t been able to see the full copies of evidence and transcripts that have been leaked to the press.\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t we gotten access to all the text messages that Ambassador [Kurt] Volker has sent over? I haven\u2019t been able to review that,\u201d Mr. Hurd said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last week. \u201cThese depositions have been going on for 10 or 12 hours a day and you\u2019re not able to sit in all of them.\u201d\n\nThe fight over the restricted documents comes as the impeachment process itself is ramping up.\n\nRepublicans not on the three leading committees have repeatedly demanded more transparency in the process and access, particularly for those on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nFormer Rep. Trey Gowdy, who once served as Oversight Committee chairman, staunchly defended the closed-door Benghazi hearings he oversaw during the Obama administration and said he still believes public congressional hearings are a \u201ccircus.\u201d But the South Carolina Republican said the Democrats\u2019 process is flawed.\n\n\u201cI prefer executive branch investigations because they\u2019re fact-centric, because you wait until the end to draw conclusions, and because there are no leaks. So I do understand the Republican frustration with the current investigation,\u201d he said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday.\n\nDemocrats have insisted that their investigation is fair by pointing out that Republicans can participate in the hearings and comparing the closed-door process to the work done by special prosecutors in the Clinton and Nixon impeachments.\n\nA staffer for Mr. Schiff declined to comment.\n\nThe closed-door hearings don\u2019t appear to be slowing down.\n\nLawmakers heard from Department of Defense official Philip Reeker on Saturday.\n\nDemocrats also issued three new subpoenas Friday demanding that two White House officials from the Office of Management and Budget and State Department counsel Ulrich Brechbuhl testify in the first week of November.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
