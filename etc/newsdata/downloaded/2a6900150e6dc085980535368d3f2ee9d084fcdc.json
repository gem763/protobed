So this year, the organization decided to make up for it by giving out two awards. Polish author Olga Tokarczuk won the 2018 prize, while Austrian author Peter Handke was awarded this year\u2019s honor.\n\nThe Nobel\u2019s official release praises Tokarczuk \u201cfor a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.\u201d Well known in Poland, Tokarczuk has also started gaining international acclaim as her books have started to be translated into English. Her 2007 novel Bieguni was published in English last year as Flights (translated by Jennifer Croft) and won the International Man Brooker Prize.\n\n\u201cTaken all together, Flights has the quality of a dream, in both the best and most maddening sense; you almost feel as if you have to bend your brain sideways to follow its trail of \u2018moments, crumbs, fleeting configurations,\u2019\u201d EW\u2019s Leah Greenblatt wrote in praise of the book. \u201cBut when her prose lifts off, it\u2019s magical: electrifying, strange, and sensationally alive.\u201d\n\nTokarczuk was given the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature because the award wasn\u2019t given out last year. The Academy was then rocked by a scandal involving Jean-Claude Arnault, a major Swedish cultural figure and husband of an Academy member who was accused of sexual harassment by 18 women. The fallout from the scandal resulted in resignations and falling public confidence in the Academy until they eventually delayed the award for a year.\n\nIf one thing\u2019s for sure, though, the scandal hasn\u2019t scared the Academy away from courting controversy. The 2019 award was given to Handke \u201cfor an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\u201d Though an influential author in Europe (in addition to novels, he also co-wrote Wim Wenders\u2019 acclaimed 1987 film Wings of Desire), Handke is also well-known for his friendship with the late Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Handke eulogized Milo\u0161evi\u0107 at his funeral after he died in a prison cell at The Hague and said in a later interview that he fully expected to never win the Nobel because of it: \u201cNow I think it\u2019s finished for me after my expressions about Yugoslavia.\u201d As it turns out, he was wrong.\n\nRelated content:", "description": "Olga Tokarczuk, Peter Handke win Nobel Prizes in Literature", "authors": ["Christian Holub"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2wugD4VZeRy61RePf3htyA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/0ffee4a86430a7dcd9b87045db5746a7", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
