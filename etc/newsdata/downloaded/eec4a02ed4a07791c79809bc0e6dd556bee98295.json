REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nThe teen apparel retailer joins a list of household names, such as Sears Holdings and Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, which have filed for bankruptcy protection since the beginning of 2017. Some retailers have even filed for a second time.\n\nToys \u2018R\u2019 Us Inc eventually went into liquidation, while others like David\u2019s Bridal, Nine West and Mattress Firm Inc reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy.\n\nBelow is a list of major retailers that filed for bankruptcy since 2017, from the most recent to the oldest:\n\nFOREVER 21 INC\n\nThe fast-fashion retailer filed late on Sunday to restructure its business and requested approval to close up to 178 U.S. stores.\n\nForever 21 listed both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion, according to the court filing.\n\nFRED\u2019S INC\n\nThe pharmacy and discount retailer said in September it filed for Chapter 11, months after the company began shuttering hundreds of unprofitable stores in the United States.\n\nBARNEYS NEW YORK INC\n\nThe luxury department store chain [DBWLDB.UL] filed for bankruptcy protection in August and put itself up for sale, pushed to the brink by falling revenue and soaring rent at its stores that caused many vendors to effectively stop shipping merchandise to the chain.\n\nDIESEL USA\n\nThe denim and accessory brand known for its jeans filed for bankruptcy in March, blaming mounting losses, a sales plunge, expensive leases and cyber fraud.\n\nAt the time of court filing, Diesel USA had $50 million to $100 million of assets, and $10 million to $50 million of liabilities.\n\nPAYLESS SHOESOURCE INC\n\nThe U.S. discount retailer in February filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time, along with its North American subsidiaries.\n\nThe retailer had said it would close about 2,500 stores in North America and wind down its e-commerce operations.\n\nGYMBOREE GROUP INC\n\nThe children\u2019s clothing retailer filed for bankruptcy protection in January, the second in almost two years, and said it will close more than 800 Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores.\n\nSEARS HOLDINGS CORP\n\nThe iconic U.S. retailer that once dominated the U.S. malls filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October, following a decade of revenue declines and hundreds of store closures.\n\nSears had listed $6.9 billion in assets and $11.3 billion in liabilities.\n\nIn February 2019, a U.S. court approved a takeover bid from its chairman Edward Lampert's hedge fund, allowing Sears to avert liquidation and preserve tens of thousands of jobs.

(reut.rs/2n8VuES)\n\nTOYS \u2018R\u2019 US\n\nThe toys retailer filed for Chapter 11 in September, hoping to restructure some $5 billion in debt, much of which stemmed from a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms in 2005.\n\nIt liquidated in 2018, a blow to hundreds of toy makers that sold products to the chain, including Barbie maker Mattel Inc and rival Hasbro Inc.\n\nAEROSOLES GROUP\n\nThe women's shoe chain filed for Chapter 11 in September with a plan to close most of its stores and focus on its wholesale, e-commerce and international businesses.
