So should the results of North Carolina\u2019s special congressional election Tuesday.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s a mistake to take the first too seriously. But it does underscore the utterly abnormal, chaotic, norm-breaking and corrupt nature of this administration. We have a leader who, like some of his dictator friends abroad, would love to be president for life. This means he will do everything he can to divide the country by sowing anxiety and intergroup hatred, something he did with gusto on the eve of the Tar Heel State\u2019s balloting.\n\nThe North Carolina results are the occasion for a useful thought experiment. If Democrat Dan McCready had defeated Republican Dan Bishop rather than lose to him by about two percentage points, we would be in the midst of Armageddon-inflected political punditry.\n\nCombined with a spate of new polls showing Trump\u2019s disapproval ratings in the 55- to 57-percent range, such an outcome would have created Democratic \u201cTrump is toast\u201d euphoria. And it could have sparked a panic among Republicans about the costs of allying with a president who plays fast and loose with intelligence, seems to profit personally from Defense Department outlays and encourages reprimands of scientists who simply want to tell the truth.\n\nInstead, we have learned from North Carolina and the new polls that: (1) divisions between rural and metropolitan voters are deepening; (2) Republicans will have great trouble winning any suburban-dominated district, which will make it very hard to win back the House; (3) the vast majority of incumbent House Republicans represent very pro-Trump seats and have no political interest in breaking with him; (4) life will stay complicated for vulnerable Republican senators up for reelection in swing states because they need turnout from voters turned on by Trump but also suburban crossover voters turned off by Trump; (5) division, distraction and fear will always be Trump\u2019s play; and (6) a large majority of the American electorate would like to throw Trump out of the White House, but Democrats will have to make it easy for them to do so. There will be no miraculous solution to the Trump problem.\n\nThe good news for Republicans in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District is that they held the seat \u2014 not a trivial matter. McCready came even closer to winning in the 2018 midterm elections than he did in the new race, forced by voter-fraud charges against the Republicans. The good news for Democrats is that while Trump carried the district by 12 points in 2016, McCready lost by only two. A comparable pro-Democratic swing in 2020 would move the state to the Democratic presidential nominee against Trump and be highly troublesome for incumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\nBut the makeup of Tuesday\u2019s vote is also revealing. The Democrat ran better than he did last year in the Charlotte suburbs of Mecklenburg County and also, according to McCready\u2019s pollster Kevin Akins, in the precincts closest to Charlotte in Republican-heavy Union County. But McCready ran behind his 2018 showing in the rest of the district, particularly in rural areas.\n\nAs a result, suburban Democratic first-termers can feel hopeful about next year, but their colleagues in more rural seats should take notice and \u201cbe realistic about how elastic any heavily rural congressional district can be,\u201d Akins said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThe country got a snapshot reminder of the realignment that\u2019s occurring all around us,\u201d he added.\n\nMolly Murphy, another McCready strategist, said national Democrats could usefully take note of how effective the health-care issue was for McCready, particularly his focus on Bishop\u2019s votes as a state senator putting him on the side of the pharmaceutical companies.\n\nEspecially in the district\u2019s rural areas, Trump\u2019s campaigning the day before the election almost certainly had an impact on boosting GOP base turnout. And Trump gave a preview of 2020 with incendiary fearmongering, accusing McCready of favoring the release of \u201cthousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities\u201d who were guilty of \u201csexual assault, robbery, drug crimes, kidnapping and homicide.\u201d And the Democrats, in Trump\u2019s rendition, became \u201cthe socialist Democrat Party.\u201d\n\nTrump knows he can\u2019t win by offering a sunny rendition of his time in office. He has to turn his opponents into ghouls. The polls make clear he will lose if 2020 is a referendum on him. He can win only if he makes it a referendum on the Democrats. Their job is to make that as difficult as possible.\n\nRead more from E.J.
