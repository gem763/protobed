If consumers have faster ways of paying their bills, and merchants can get faster access to their sales revenue without needing a bank, they won\u2019t want to keep as much money in accounts that pay extremely low interest.\u201d\n\nAs the report notes, consumers and businesses currently store around $14 trillion in deposits with United States banks alone that pay out an extremely low rate of interest on average.\n\nBanks currently pay less than 0.1% interest on checking and savings accounts, and only a slightly higher rate on one-year certificates of deposit. Meanwhile, the amount banks receive from routine overnight loans has climbed from 0.3% in 2015 to over 2% in 2019.\n\nSlow adopters will fall by the wayside\n\nThis dependence on deposit accounts to process payments by the vast majority of the population ensures huge profits for banks. In addition, banks charge high fees from credit card vendors \u2014 a cost that is mostly then passed on to the consumer.\n\nDifferent models for future central bank digital currencies could also develop in ways that would bypass commercial banks for at least part of the payment process.\n\nAnd if adoption is driven by the private sector \u2014 as with Libra, due to the unprecedented scale effects it has \u2014 it could have a huge impact on the status quo.\n\nHe argued that the current system is not sustainable and that technology, economics and public pressure will wrest control of the global payment system away from banks.\n\n\u201cThe smartest banks will be on the front edge of this, but others will be reluctant to cannibalize their very profitable franchises,\u201d he said. To those banks that are slow on the mark, he cautioned:", "description": "A professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business says cryptocurrencies will put an end to the windfall that banks currently enjoy from low-interest deposits", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNTNmMGE4ZjczYjZlZDBhZjJkOWRmZTM5NDBhMTM4YTYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
