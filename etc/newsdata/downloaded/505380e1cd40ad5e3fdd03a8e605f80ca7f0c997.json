For the global economy, the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around $US700 billion ($1 trillion) by 2020, or about 0.8 per cent of GDP. As a reference, this is approximately the size of Switzerland\u2019s entire economy.\"\n\nDr Georgieva also said \"real change\" is needed to improve the global trading system and it will require \"difficult decisions and political will\".\n\n\"Countries need to address legitimate concerns related to their trade practices. That means dealing with subsidies, as well as intellectual property rights and technology transfers.\n\n\"We also need a more modern global trading system, particularly to unlock the full potential of services and e-commerce.\n\n\"And every country must do more to help communities harmed by the dislocations associated with technology and trade.\"\n\nDr Georgieva said a synchronised fiscal response may be needed.\n\n\"If the global economy slows more sharply than expected, a coordinated fiscal response may be needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Let me be clear. We are not there.\"\n\nThe message echoes the one in a landmark international report released on Tuesday that endorsed \"valuable\" crisis-era central bank tools, such as buying financial assets and negative interest rates to protect economies from recession.\n\nThat report, from the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS), also warned the use of the crisis-era tools must be supported by the government and prudential regulator.\n\n\"One key lesson is that the tools are most effective when used together with a broader set of policies, like fiscal and prudential measures,\" said Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Philip Lowe, who chaired the group which wrote the report.", "description": "More than 90 per cent of the world is now expected to record slower growth this calendar year, according to IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/45658b9fbf0a964b894660c6d198d9d8665dd9df", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
