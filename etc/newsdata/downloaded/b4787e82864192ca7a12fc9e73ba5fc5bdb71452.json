I didn\u2019t have a deposit to rent. It was horrendous,\u201d she told The Independent.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt was cold. I couldn\u2019t cook for myself and washing was quite difficult. Just having to do basic things was really challenging.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It was a nightmare. I am surprised she passed anything because she was so stressed.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t have any space from each other. There was no room for a desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt caused a great deal of anxiety and I felt like I had completely failed as a mother,\u201d she added.\n\nThe charity has also noted a rise in the number of teachers seeking help for school uniforms for their own children and being forced to use food banks.\n\nOne full-time teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Independent that she had to use a food bank ten times in the past year in order to feed her two children.\n\nThe mother has struggled to make ends meet amid rising childcare costs \u2013 and this term she has had to send her four-year-old daughter to school without a uniform as she cannot afford it.\n\nThe teacher, who received financial help from the charity, said: \u201cAt school, in the run-up to Christmas, we had donations for food banks where everybody was asked to bring something in each day and I was watching what the kids were bringing in and thinking that could be my Christmas food bank voucher.\n\n\u201cIt was quite depressing to think I have children here who are now donating stuff that I am going to end up eating. It just feels wrong.\u201d\n\nRichard Faulkner, head of policy at Education Support Partnership, said he has read \u201cvery distressing\u201d applications from teachers \u201cliving in their car\u201d and surviving on just \u00a315 a week once rent and bills are paid.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t expect teachers to be homeless and they don\u2019t expect them to be getting the majority of their food from food banks. This is the reality we are seeing on an increasingly frequent basis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe majority of applications come from teachers working in education in the southeast of England \u2013 and low salaries of teachers play a part in a number of cases, Mr Faulkner added.\n\nMore teachers could quit the profession in areas where living costs are so high unless urgent action is taken by the government, the charity has warned.\n\nTom, a primary school teacher in east London, said he has considered leaving teaching as his salary does not match high living costs.\n\nThe single parent, who was given a grant to help move to a larger rented property with his children, said he is living \u201con the breadline\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cRenting is \u00a315,000 a year for a pokey little two-bed flat in a not particularly nice part of London.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t really been a pay rise. I do after-school clubs which pay a little bit and I work on Saturdays, as we do a Saturday school, to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cIt is not a well-paid job and in a city that is cripplingly expensive.\u201d\n\nEvery year around half of the staff at his school leave amid high housing costs and low pay, he said.\n\n\u201cI have considered completely relocating. I think there is such a problem in London that if things continue there will be a real narrowing of the demographics of teachers.\n\n\u201cI am 38 and I am one of the oldest teachers in the school because as soon as people have families they move because they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d he added.\n\nColleagues at his school have also given him clothes from the lost property so his children have uniforms, he said.\n\nKim Knappett, joint president of the National Education Union (NEU), has heard of more reports of teachers and school staff using food banks in the past twelve months.\n\nThe science teacher, who volunteers at a food bank in London, said: \u201cI have had to step out the back when members of staff from schools I know come in to collect parcels and you know that is incredibly embarrassing for someone who is a teacher or a member of support staff.\n\n\u201cThe fact you can\u2019t provide food for your children and yet you are working full time just doesn\u2019t compute in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nOn the reasons for the rise, Ms Knappett added: \u201cThe housing costs are going up and up. People are trying to buy school uniforms, clothes and food from a diminishing pot of leftover money.\n\n\u201cOur teacher salaries are definitely at least 15 per cent less in real terms than they were in 2010.\u201d\n\nA study from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) last month concluded that teachers\u2019 pay in the UK is below the international average.\n\nStatutory salaries for teachers in England and Scotland \u2013 with 15 years of experience and the most common qualification \u2013 have not recovered to \u201cpre-Great Recession highs,\u201d the report found.\n\nThe minimum salary for teachers in England and Wales, excluding London, is \u00a323,720, while the minimum for Inner London is \u00a329,664.\n\nThe government has recently pledged to increase salaries for new teachers to \u00a330,000 by 2022-23.\n\nA Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said: \u201cThe increase would make starting salaries for teachers among the most competitive in the graduate labour market, building on the above-inflation average pay increases for teachers in the last two years.\u201d", "description": "Teachers are living in sheds, cars and eating out of food banks as the number of professionals seeking vital financial support has surged, a charity has warned.\u00a0 Hundreds of teachers and support staff are at risk of losing their home or being unable to pay rent, according to the Education Support Partnership, a charity that provides emergency grants.", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/13/15/teacher.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
