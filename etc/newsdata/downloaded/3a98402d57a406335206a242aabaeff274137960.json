But as an exclusively online, multiplayer-based competitive team shooter, Overwatch might be the least likely fit for the Switch, at least on paper.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last day or two playing the Switch port, and at first glance, that impression is correct. As a way to play Overwatch seriously, the Switch port is bad. There\u2019s no other way to put it. If you\u2019re playing it hooked up to a TV, you\u2019ll be better off on a PS4 or Xbox One, with their far more powerful processors and graphics cards (or better yet, an actual gaming PC). And while portable mode has plenty of benefits, which I\u2019ll get into in a moment, performance there isn\u2019t much better.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: it\u2019s perfectly playable, and Overwatch\u2019s cartoonish art style works great even with the lower fidelity graphics (as opposed to, say, the Witcher 3 port), but \u201cit has basic functionality\u201d should be a low bar to clear. I haven\u2019t had quite as many performance issues as other reviewers have reported, although I still have seen some character models that were late to pop into a skirmish match and some lag, especially when whipping the camera around quickly. I spend almost all of my time playing as Zenyatta or Reinhardt, characters that don\u2019t rely quite as much on pinpoint accuracy and fast gunplay as, say, Soldier 76 or McCree. My brief tests as those characters were far less enjoyable to play on the Switch, though.\n\nAnother issue is the lack of voice chat. Not that Overwatch doesn\u2019t support it \u2014 it does, and even does so without using Nintendo\u2019s convoluted and terrible app system, so all you need is a regular 3.5mm headset with a microphone. But Switch players seem even more averse to using mics than even Xbox and PS4 players \u2014 I never saw a single other mic user in any of my games with random matchmaking, making it tough to coordinate (a critical part of Overwatch strategy). Unless you specifically seek out fellow mic users in advance (Overwatch helps by offering an in-game group finder), you\u2019ll likely be stuck playing silently.\n\nAnd yet, despite all that, I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time playing Overwatch on the Switch for the same reasons that the Switch is always so great: it removes so much of the day-to-day friction of dealing with a modern console and TV setup that even with these rough edges, it\u2019s still really enjoyable to play.\n\nThe Switch port reduces the barriers to playing compared to a traditional console\n\nIt\u2019s similar to Fortnite on mobile or the Switch. Is it the best way to play the game if you\u2019re serious about Fortnite? Almost certainly not. The graphics are worse, the controls are rough, and the entire experience is clearly not designed for the platform as the ideal form. But because of the Switch\u2019s self-contained form factor, Overwatch on the Switch offers something that no other platform can: freedom from a TV or monitor.\n\nIt\u2019s Overwatch that I can play while binge-watching the latest Netflix show or while watching an afternoon of football in the background. It\u2019s Overwatch that I can knock out a quick round of before bed, or when I\u2019m away from my apartment visiting my parents for an extended weekend. It\u2019s Overwatch that doesn\u2019t require fighting my roommates for the TV, then waiting for an Xbox to boot up, run a system update, and finally connect to a server. Now, in fairness, none of these benefits really apply if you dock the Switch, but as I noted before, if you\u2019re playing Overwatch on a TV screen, there are already better options.\n\nIs it the best version of Overwatch? No. But the Switch port reduces the barriers to playing enough that I can see myself playing it far more often than the Xbox or PC versions. The very fact that it\u2019s on the Switch makes it that much more available to play at the drop of a hat.\n\nEven the gyroscopic aiming \u2014 the bigger addition from vanilla Overwatch on other consoles \u2014 is actually good, especially when you\u2019re playing in the Switch\u2019s handheld mode. I was expecting to hate it, but after a few rounds it just kind of clicked. I never really got to the point where I was swinging the console around in wide arcs to look around or move (the right Joy-Con joystick is still the best method for that), but it helped a lot in more subtle aiming. The fact that you\u2019re also playing against other Switch players who are stuck with the same controls makes it a more level playing field, too.\n\nThe lack of cross-platform progression is disappointing\n\nOne of my biggest gripes that is solvable is the lack of any cross-platform progression. I\u2019ve spent years unlocking character skins, emotes, and other cosmetics on my Xbox, and it\u2019s frustrating to not have my rare Zenyatta styles available on the Switch. It\u2019s even more disheartening to realize that I\u2019m looking at Blizzard\u2019s RNG-based slog of random loot boxes to even have a chance of getting my favorite skins again. I get that cross-platform anything between modern consoles is still a relatively new concept, but major titles like Destiny 2 and Fortnite have figured out how to manage it. It\u2019d be nice if Blizzard \u2014 which almost certainly has the resources and clout to pull off a similar system \u2014 could figure it out, too.\n\nSome of these issues are fixable. Some are inherent to the Switch. But ultimately the appeal of being able to play Overwatch whenever and wherever I want mostly makes up for the problems. It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect from an Overwatch port on the Switch \u2014 with all the good and bad that go with that.", "description": "Overwatch has finally made its way to the Nintendo Switch, fulfilling the endless requests from me that Blizzard port its popular team shooter to Nintendo\u2019s portable console.
