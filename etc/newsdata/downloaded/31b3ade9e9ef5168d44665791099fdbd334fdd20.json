Losing my singing voice\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "The star of stage and screen on painful memories, over-apologising and eating cornflakes in the middle of the night\n\nBorn in Surrey, Julie Andrews, 84, began performing at 12. In the 50s, she made her Broadway stage debut in The Boy Friend and then starred in My Fair Lady. She played the title role in the 1964 film Mary Poppins, winning an Academy Award, and in 1965 made The Sound Of Music. Her second memoir, Home Work, has just been published. Andrews raised five children with her late husband, Blake Edwards, and lives on Long Island, New York.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nSitting on my mother\u2019s lap in the car and, as my father pulled up to our little house in Walton, saying what they tell me is my very first word \u2013 home.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nInsecurity.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nThoughtlessness and lack of consideration for others.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nPerforming on stage as a child in dirty, rain-spattered socks. I had forgotten to pack my dress shoes, so my mother painted white ballet slippers over my socks with what they used to call \u201cwet white\u201d. But my socks were still wet and I left little white footprints all over the stage.\n\nAside from property, what\u2019s the most expensive thing you\u2019ve ever bought?\n\nI saw a very expensive painting by a wonderful American painter called Charles Burchfield. I really loved it \u2013 it hit me in the solar plexus \u2013 and I thought if I did three extra concerts on tour, I might be able to afford it. And I did.\n\nWhat is your phone wallpaper?\n\nMy poodles, Button and Barney.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nSomething happening to my kids.\n\nWhat would your superpower be?\n\nEnding poverty.\n\nWhat makes you unhappy?\n\nIf my kids are unhappy, I can\u2019t relax or be happy at all.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nInterrupting.\n\nWhich book changed your life?\n\nA book my father bought me when I was eight or nine. It\u2019s called The Little Grey Men, by Denys Watkins-Pitchford, under the nom de plume BB. It opened my eyes to the wonder of nature. I eventually acquired the US book rights and was proud to publish it for a while.\n\nWhat is your favourite smell?\n\nFresh earth in a warm greenhouse.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA botanist or a florist.\n\nWhat is top of your bucket list?\n\nA reading vacation. I have so little time to read. My idea is to be in a lovely place under an umbrella for a week or two, reading all the books on my bedside table.\n\nIs it better to give or to receive?\n\nTo give.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nA bowl of cornflakes in the middle of the night.\n\nWhat do you owe your parents?\n\nThe discovery of my voice.\n\nTo whom would you most like to say sorry and why?\n\nI think I over-apologise as it is.\n\nWhat does love feel like?\n\nAs you go through life, you discover so many forms of love \u2013 passionate, compassionate, familial, friendship. Love is hard to describe but it\u2019s wonderful.\n\nHave you ever said \u201cI love you\u201d without meaning it?\n\nProbably.\n\nWho would you invite to your dream dinner party?\n\nTH White, the English author who wrote The Once And Future King, whom I used to know, Philip Pullman whom I adore as a writer, Stephen Sondheim, Tom Stoppard and Moss Hart, the great director who has passed. I think that dinner would be perfect.\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\nSorry, and a few unprintable ones, too.\n\nWhat has been your biggest disappointment?\n\nLosing my singing voice. I had to have an operation and unfortunately it was not successful. I\u2019ve not been able to sing since.\n\nIf you could go back in time, where would you go?\n\nRenaissance Europe.\n\nWhen did you last cry, and why?\n\nWorking on my memoir because some memories were painful to revisit.\n\nWhat single thing would improve the quality of your life?\n\nA cure for arthritis.\n\nWhat is the most important lesson life has taught you?\n\nWhen in doubt, stand still.\n\nWhat song would you like played at your funeral?\n\nSomething triumphant, I couldn\u2019t tell you what but something vibrant and joyous.\n\n\u2022 Home Work: My Hollywood Years is published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson, priced \u00a320.
