Still, President Donald Trump and his supporters insist that during this early stage he get a myriad of protections that he claims are available to criminal defendants. Those are figments of his imagination.\n\nTrump does not have a right to confront the whistleblower right now. If this case were in court, his threats would give the judge reason to put restrictions on his access to the witness. In organized crime trials and congressional hearings our institutions have developed the tools to shield witnesses to defend the rule of law.\n\nInvestigators drive an investigation. Once they have amassed evidence, the prosecution steps in. During this process, a suspect has none of the rights the president asserts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA suspect can opt to cooperate, in the hopes of averting an indictment, or refuse to do so. The latter is the path the president has chosen. That gives him no special protections.\n\nThere is no right to confront any witness during an investigation. And our criminal justice process limits that right later if the defendant or his consorts appear to threaten a witness. Those procedures were developed and tested during organized crime trials.\n\nThe criminal justice system is regularly tasked with protecting crucial witnesses whose safety is endangered. Sometimes it fails spectacularly, and every failure harms the rule of law. Often it succeeds in assuring the trial testimony that is crucial for conviction and in protecting the witness\u2019s life.\n\nProsecutors depend on witnesses to make their cases. Cooperation can be life threatening for eye-witnesses to gang slayings, police informants, undercover agents, and \u201cmoles.\u201d Sometimes offenders or their friends put out word that nobody testifying against them will survive it; for undercover officers, no such threat is needed as the danger is obvious. Some witnesses are willing to take that risk, others are not. If they recant or \u201cforget,\u201d if they disappear or refuse to testify, the case may be over. That is a win for crime and a defeat of law.\n\nProsecutors have expanded their tools to protect witnesses. They may temporarily relocate the witness to assure his or her appearance at trial. On the back-end, federal prosecutors may promise entry into the federal witness protection program. It was developed to protect Mafia turncoats after their testimony. Soon, Takashi 6ix9ine may find himself in the program after his testimony against organized crime figures. Yet, that program is an extreme measure for a high-profile witness whose life continues to be at risk after testifying.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo protect witnesses, courts occasionally agree to restrict the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights and the right to a public trial. Yet, they do so only sparingly. Still they have allowed witnesses to appear in disguise, shielded by a fake beard and glasses. Some courts have denied the defendant access to a witness\u2019s name and home address. In yet other cases, courts have agreed to close the hearing to protect the witness. Those restrictions are often crucial for witnesses whose identity needs to be protected.\n\nLimited restrictions on the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights serve to protect the integrity of our criminal justice system. Congress should adopt the same strategy. The Congressional committees should be able to hear from whistleblower, in closed session or in disguise if needed.\n\nSince the president, the target of the investigation, has threatened the whistleblower, there is powerful reason to continue to shield the whistleblower\u2019s identity both from him and the public. The mob was once thought all-powerful, but its influence and strength were negligible compared to those of the president.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher for the country and our democracy. Mythical protections for the defendant should not paralyze our institutions. The lessons the judicial system has learned in the battle against organized crime should serve as a blueprint throughout the impeachment.\n\nCongress would do disservice to the rule of law if a crucial witness failed to testify out of fear. Let the whistleblower be disguised.\n\nNora V. Demleitner is the Roy L.
