In January, Tucker Carlson\u2019s now-infamous on-air monologue reignited the anti-capitalist firestorm by tearing into American elites and accusing them of not caring about most Americans. He described them as free-market ideologues seeking to profit at any expense to their fellow countrymen. It\u2019s a sentiment that spread when Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen, another prominent right-wing critic of markets, published his 2018 book Why Liberalism Failed. Deneen goes so far as to praise a form of Marxism, claiming it will better protect family and community.\n\nBut critics like Deneen and Carlson have misdiagnosed the problem. As a result, they have no hope of fixing it.\n\nMarket critics attack American consumerism and lament that, as Carlson described, \u201cdeliveries of plastic garbage from China\u201d won\u2019t make people happy or help them find meaning. They claim that market forces are responsible for destroying family and community and that GDP has come to be seen as an end in itself. And they\u2019re right: material goods will not make people happy. They\u2019re also correct to be concerned about the collapse of family and community, the institutions that give \u201cstability and meaning to existence\u201d in the words of sociologist Robert Nisbet.\n\nBut markets are not to blame for the collapse of these important interpersonal relationships. This confusion seems to stem from a misunderstanding over what the market actually is\u2014the result, unfortunately, of a dearth of economic literacy.\n\nIn his screed, Carlson remarked that \u201cmarket capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster.\u201d And indeed, the market is a tool. It\u2019s a method of efficiently allocating resources to where they will find their highest valued use. But free-market critics seem to ignore the fact that the efficient use of resources is determined by the consumers. \u201cPlastic garbage from China\u201d doesn\u2019t show up on Walmart shelves because it rains down from the sky: it\u2019s there because people want it. If they didn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t buy it, and Walmart would stop trying to sell it. The market is a tool, and it\u2019s a tool that everyone\u2014not just elites\u2014use to get what they want.\n\nIt may well be that people should have different preferences, but that\u2019s hardly the market\u2019s fault. In fact, the economist Ludwig von Mises, someone Carlson would likely label a \u201cmarket fundamentalist,\u201d argues that it is the fault of society\u2019s elites for not persuading the masses \u201cto drop their vulgar tastes and habits,\u201d one of the very points Carlson makes.\n\nBut whether or not elites care about the well-being of people in Middle America doesn\u2019t affect the shape of the U.S. economy. It\u2019s the consumers\u2014the vast majority of whom comprise Middle America\u2014who decide what the economy will look like in the end. Mises called this \u201cconsumer sovereignty,\u201d writing, \u201cthe captain is the consumer. Neither the entrepreneurs nor the farmers nor the capitalists determine what has to be produced. The consumers do that.\u201d\n\nWalmart doesn\u2019t replace small main street shops because they send in tanks and crush them. Walmart replaces these shops because they are better at providing what people want. It may be more variety, the quality of service, or low prices. But, for whatever reason, people preferred to shop at Walmart and not the smaller stores. That might not be good for human flourishing, but that is another conversation altogether.\n\nMarket critics like Carlson and Deneen blame capitalism for disrupting the family and ruining community. But Robert Nisbet, the mid-century conservative sociologist who wrote extensively about community, didn\u2019t agree. According to Nisbet, capitalism isn\u2019t \u201cthe primary agent in the transmutation of social groups and communities.\u201d Rather, Nisbet points to the rise of highly centralized and powerful political states as the main culprit.\n\nConservative critics should be concerned about the collapse of important institutions like family and community. We lack meaningful social relationships, and indeed, those are vital components of meaning in people\u2019s lives. Yet, when they blame markets, critics are attacking a symptom rather than the disease. Many people attempt to fill the void in their lives left by the lack of meaningful social relationships with consumerism, but removing the coping mechanism will not cure the illness.\n\nNo, what we truly ache for is a change in our values\u2014values that determine our conduct in the market. Capitalism doesn\u2019t make people work too much or accumulate more material possessions than they need. People make those decisions and the system delivers. What we should, instead, ask is why they\u2019re making these decisions.\n\nWith the decline of the important associations that help give meaning and existential context to our lives\u2014such as family\u2014people have sought to fill this void with work, pleasure, materialism, and even drugs. The market, ever the obedient servant, has striven to fill these desires. But if the desires change for the positive, the market will, over time, mirror that change.\n\nBut the process begins in the home. Philosopher John Cuddeback\u2019s excellent suggestion that people should begin to reclaim the concept of the household as a place of shared work and unity\u2014and therefore existential meaning\u2014 is where we ought to start. Unlike many relationships in life, household activity is not merely guided by seeking to accomplish an end (say manufacturing a widget or building a shed) but the \u201cshared action toward that end is itself an intended good\u201d in that \u201cthe family is not together just for the sake of some end; it is together for the sake of being together.\u201d The reclamation of this important relationship would go a long way in addressing the hyper-consumerist market that critics bemoan.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s harder to do this than it is to rail against the evils of capitalism.\n\nWe have met the enemy, and he is us. Attacking capitalism fails to address the truth that capitalism merely gives people that for which they ask. If we want to change what capitalism is producing we must first invest in the difficult work of cultivating a virtuous and ordered people who value the things in life that are truly important.
