Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nAnd the acting ambassador who replaced Yovanovitch, Bill Taylor, has just landed back in Kyiv after delivering explosive testimony that accused President Trump of leaning on Zelensky to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden and \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s supposed interference in the 2016 election.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump attacked his own top diplomat in Kyiv -- Taylor, a Vietnam veteran who was first appointed ambassador by George W. Bush -- as a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d Reminded that Pompeo had brought Taylor out of retirement after Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine, Trump said, \"Everybody makes mistakes.\u201d\n\nUkrainian officials have said publicly that nothing is amiss, but private accounts \u2014 including Taylor\u2019s testimony, which detailed his interactions with his disturbed counterparts in Kyiv \u2014 have indicated otherwise.\n\nOne continuing source of anxiety in Kyiv is the military assistance aid Trump allegedly held up in an effort to pressure Zelenksy -- aid that was renewed when Taylor and lawmakers from both parties raised alarms inside the administration.\n\nSome of President Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill have erupted in anger over the withholding of the security funds, even as they\u2019ve complained that Democrats are running an illegitimate and unfair impeachment process.\n\nIn a continuing resolution to fund the government through November 21, Congress approved extending for another year $250 million in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds that were set to expire on September 30. Trump signed the CR late last month, but Ukrainians are still apprehensive about the funds \u201cgoing through without a hitch,\u201d according to Andrij Dobriansky, a representative for the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America.\n\n\u201cKyiv is in wait-and-see mode,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, a former Pentagon official with responsibility for Russia and Ukraine under President Obama.\n\nAs Taylor noted in his opening statement, Ukraine remains in active hostilities with Russia. \u201cAmbassador Volker and I could see the armed and hostile Russian-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge across the line of contact,\u201d Taylor said, recalling a trip to the front line in northern Donbass in July. \u201cOver 13,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the war, one or two a week,\u201d he continued. \u201cMore Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance.\u201d\n\nSeveral senior officials with a Ukraine portfolio have either testified in the impeachment probe or plan to do so are still in government, in addition to Taylor: Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent; Acting Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Phil Reeker; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia Laura Cooper; and Tim Morrison, Hill\u2019s replacement on the NSC.\n\nTaylor is still carrying out his duties as usual, his lawyers told POLITICO. But Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he worries \u201cthere isn\u2019t any energy\u201d behind the default U.S. policy of support for Ukraine right now, \u201cand that the remaining key actors are going to tread very carefully.\u201d\n\nJohn Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, said he believes the basic process of formulating Ukraine policy, starting at the deputy assistant secretary and assistant secretary level at the State Department, DOD and the NSC and moving up the chain to the head of each institution is still in place.\n\nBut he singled out Volker\u2019s focus on negotiating a settlement to the war in eastern Ukraine as an area of special concern, given the envoy\u2019s sudden departure.\n\n\u201cOne thing that requires constant attention is the Minsk process,\u201d Herbst said. \u201cVolker\u2019s resignation is really unfortunate in that context, but I think steps are being taken now to replace him.\u201d\n\nThe Minsk process refers to negotiations that have been underway since 2014 to end the war with Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. Zelensky announced on Oct. 1 that he had signed on to the so-called Steinmeier formula, a German-led road map to ceasing hostilities that many in Ukraine reject as a capitulation to Moscow.\n\nThe Trump administration would not answer basic questions about where Ukraine policy stands now and who is in charge of it. Officials at the National Security Council and U.S. Embassy to the E.U. referred requests for comment to the State Department, which did not respond to multiple inquiries.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo bristled this week at a local reporter\u2019s questions about the impeachment hearings.\n\nAsked what he did with a cable from Taylor expressing his concerns about what he described as the \u201cirregular channel,\u201d Pompeo said he was \u201cnot going to talk about [the] inquiry this morning\u201d and reiterated that Democrats were not allowing State Department lawyers to sit in on depositions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d said Pompeo, who is contemplating running for Senate in his home state of Kansas. \u201cI get notes from people in Kansas all the time saying it\u2019s not right, they think it\u2019s unfair too.\u201d\n\nDaniel Fried, a longtime State Department official who travels frequently to Ukraine as a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the Ukrainians \u201cuniversally think it\u2019s bad news that Volker left, because they trusted him. And who would take his job now, knowing there might be some backchannel undoing you?\u201d (The Atlantic Council has taken money from Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden once sat.)\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

A confirmation hearing for Sullivan, currently the deputy secretary of state, has not yet been scheduled by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a committee spokesperson said.\n\nWilliam Burns, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former deputy secretary of state, said that \u201ca dysfunctional Ukraine\u201d will be looked upon fondly by Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe\u2019ve contributed to that as well, and Putin becomes one of the big winners.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b8/88/63e4cb7a48dc91a64166710bbc56/191010-trump-zelensky-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
