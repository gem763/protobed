Well done Michael.\u2019\n\nWright has now lost to MVG in finals at the World Championship, UK Open (twice), World Series Finals (twice), Premier League, Grand Slam, Grand Prix and the Champions League.\n\nVan Gerwen, though, had little sympathy for his vanquished foe as he won the only major PDC event that he had never previously managed.\n\n\u2018Peter put me under pressure and I made it really difficult for myself,\u2019 said the world champion.\n\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have put myself in that position, Peter had a couple of clear darts to win the game. He missed, he was nervous because he looked around and I took great advantage of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t complain, this was a phenomenal weekend for me, a high standard of darts, I didn\u2019t have below a 100 average.\u2019\n\nMORE: Michael van Gerwen picks up Champions League of Darts belt after epic comeback against Peter Wright\n\nMORE: Gerwyn Price admits the pressure got to him in classic with Michael van Gerwen at Champions League of Darts", "description": "Peter Wright suffered another devastating loss to Michael van Gerwen on Sunday night, missing three darts for the match before losing 11-10 in the Champions League of Darts final.
