After 1989\u2019s The Little Mermaid kicked off what\u2019s known as \u201cThe Disney Renaissance,\u201d in conjunction with the childhoods of the millennial generation, Hercules became the only Walt Disney Animations Studio release of the 1990s to not cross $100 million at the box office.\n\nWhile reviews skewed positive, they were hardly the raves that catapulted the likes of Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or Aladdin to canonical status.\n\nBut millennials grew up, and so too did their appreciation for the otherwise overshadowed film. The movie achieved a cult-like fandom over the next two decades, with its three most memorable Alan Menken/David Zippel songs\u2014the booming ballad \u201cGo the Distance,\u201d torch song \u201cI Won\u2019t Say (I'm in Love),\u201d and gospel barn-burner \u201cZero to Hero\u201d\u2014rising the ranks of indelible Disney favorites.\n\nYet as Broadway stagings of Disney musicals became one of the House of Mouse\u2019s most reliable investments, Hercules\u2019 number was never drawn, making the clamor for a live production all the more intense\u2014hence the rush for tickets to the Public Works staging at the Delacorte.\n\nWhat has also matured nicely, it turns out, is the film\u2019s message. Hercules is based on the Ancient Greek myth, the half-human, half-god son of Zeus. What was a cute morality musical about sacrifice underlined with its treacly message encapsulated in dialogue\u2014\u201ca true hero isn't measured by the size of his strength, but by the strength of his heart\u201d\u2014has, under the stars in Central Park transformed into a siren call for Trumpian times.\n\nIt turns out that the Public Works production of Hercules isn\u2019t just the hottest show in New York, but the perfect show for right now.\n\nA slight hand of updating\u2014a few added lines here, some modernizing of characters there, the application of a political lens everywhere in between\u2014brings the musical\u2019s values to the forefront.\n\nWhat do we owe our community, and what are we owed ourselves; the power of the community is greater than the ambitions of one; a \u201cpair of pretty pecs,\u201d at the end of the day, are just that. The romantic storyline and the show\u2019s heroine, Megara, is given a feminist update\u2014and pants!\u2014while the villain Hades is all-but painted orange in case you don't get the message.\n\nMore, there\u2019s the fabric of this work itself, staged with an ensemble of nearly 200 New York City locals: dancers, marching band musicians, singers, and amateur community members\u2014everyone from Air Force veterans to retired teachers to 7-year-old elementary school students\u2014joining professional Broadway stars to put together this allegory on the necessity of the whole tribe to come together to better society.\n\nOr even, in its bleakest, most dangerous times, save it.\n\nPerhaps it was lost on a millennial generation that has elevated the middle-performing Disney musical to cult-favorite status that \u201cthe gospel truth\u201d at the heart of the songs and slapstick was a profound lesson on civic engagement and responsibility.\n\nMaybe that should have been obvious; we are talking about Greece, the birthplace of democracy, after all. But either way, the Public Works production updates the script in key places in order to blare that message to the cheap seats. (Of course, at the Delacorte that is every seat. They\u2019re free for all.)\n\nThe basic plot of Hercules (how closely this adheres to the actual myth, I\u2019ll never know; the curse of Disney!) is that Zeus and Hera, who reign over the gods on Olympus, have their first son.\n\nIn a quintessentially Disney turn of events, Zeus\u2019 jealous brother, Hades, who rules the Underworld, is concerned with how Hercules\u2019 arrival affects his plan to overthrow Zeus and rule Olympus.\n\nThe Fates deliver a prophecy to Hades. In 18 years, he will be able to unleash the Titans, whom he has imprisoned, and they will help him conquer Olympus\u2014but only if Hercules doesn\u2019t get in the way. So Hades sends his two minions, Pain and Panic, to dispose of the young boy.\n\n\u201c While only half-god, Hercules\u2019 strength is still super-human, which gets him into trouble and leaves him ostracized by his community \u201d\n\nThe hapless duo only manage to give him half of a bottle of poison before being thwarted\u2014only draining Hercules of half of his immortal strength\u2014and leaving him to be discovered by surrogate human parents back on Earth.\n\nWhile only half-god, Hercules\u2019 strength is still super-human, which gets him into trouble and leaves him ostracized by his community. After learning who his real parents are and that he can reclaim godhood and return to Olympus if he becomes a true hero, he sets out to become one\u2014as if someone can just announce they are going to be a hero.\n\nDuring hero training, he encounters what he thinks is a damsel in distress, the seductive Megara. But Meg, it turns out, has sold her soul to Hades, and is working with him to entrap Hercules so that he is out of his way for good.\n\nThey fall in love. Hercules learns that heroism isn\u2019t defined by muscles, but by sacrifice. Everyone is saved from Hades\u2019 wrath.\n\nThat plot remains largely intact in this production, though it is given an incredibly potent injection of 2019 politics.\n\n\u201c Am I going to use Disney\u2019s Hercules as a cautionary tale and shaming narrative against the banality and uselessness of influencer culture and social media vanity? You can\u2019t stop me! \u201d\n\nWhen Herc first broadcasts his intent to become a hero, the townspeople are unimpressed. They don\u2019t need someone to lift boulders, scale mountains, and slay mythical monsters. What they want from hero is help securing affordable housing, better jobs, and more respectful civil discourse. (Cue the pandered-to applause of the Delacorte crowd.)\n\nThanks to the expert training of Philocletes, Herc does actually start achieving some feats of heroism, in the classic sense, turning him into a celebrity about town. (As recounted in \u201cZero to Hero\u201d: \u201cFolks lined up, just to watch him flex.\u201d) But when the threat of Hades becomes real, the empty value of that fame comes into sharp focus.\n\nAm I going to use Disney\u2019s Hercules as a cautionary tale and shaming narrative against the banality and uselessness of influencer culture and social media vanity? You can\u2019t stop me!\n\nThere are other of-the-now updates.\n\nKrysta Rodriguez reinvents Meg as even more of a feminist badass. If the character\u2019s film journey was that she\u2019s no damsel in distress, here even the notion that a woman needs a man for rescue is enough to make her gag.\n\nThe race-blind casting of Jelani Alladin as Hercules is significant in its own right, but so, too, is the blackness he brings to the role\u2014and, in fact, the entire ensemble brings to the production. There are knowing winks at black culture throughout, from both Alladin and the diverse ensemble, that prove how much value multiculturalism brings to the arts\u2014a searing message given the commercial commodity whose mouse ears loomed over this production.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Trump. I mean Hades.\n\nRoger Bart\u2019s Hades is obsessed with attaining a position of power he did not earn, for seemingly no other reason than ego: Being seen as being the most powerful is the draw.\n\nWhen there\u2019s a threat to that pursuit of power, he marginalizes and diminishes so that he can strike easier. He has his lackeys do his dirty work for him, and they do so incompetently. When a hero rises, he attacks them, belittles their character, and attempts to con the community against them.\n\nBut in Hercules , the community bands together to unite in a fight against him anyway.\n\nIt has a profound effect on Hercules. He\u2019s spent this entire journey in pursuit of something he felt entitled to: not just fame and hero status, but ascension to the elite, to be among the gods.\n\nHere, he realizes what he owes his community is far greater than what he felt he was ever owed himself. He realizes that the individual is not greater than the community. More, he learns what the community can teach an individual about himself.\n\nAt a time when subtlety has gone the way of the gods, there\u2019s something very of the moment about this take on Hercules.\n\nThe message is as clear as the Muses\u2019 roof-shattering belting, the way we kind of crave it these days. It\u2019s not art as lip service, either. The community is right there in front of you, all 200 of them. In the spirit of Disney hokeyness, it\u2019s all very inspirational, the clunky, concerted effort of it all.\n\nIt\u2019s something Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, says himself in the Hercules program. \u201cHercules is forced to choose, over and over, between his personal aspirations and ambitions and his place in the human community. We, too, face that struggle every day. We are human, we are divine, we are individuals, but we are part of something much larger than ourselves.\u201d\n\nWell, bless my soul.", "description": "As New Yorkers clamor for tickets to the free Public Works production of the Disney favorite, the musical\u2019s anti-Trump, pro-feminist, community-building values shine through.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567544046/190903-fallon-hercules-tease_kl26b8"}
