A frightened young fox cub then appears on the A352 behind the huntsmen.\n\nSeeing it, the huntsmen, who have been milling around by the side of the road, canter toward the animal as the hounds approach the busy road from the wood. \u200b\n\nRealising they are being filmed, the huntsmen then try desperately and unsuccessfully to keep the hounds off the road as traffic rushes towards them.\u200b\n\nOne huntsmen shouts, 'Wo' and brandishes his whip at cars as the dogs, high on fox scent, run out on the road.\u200b\n\nChaos then reigns with horse and hounds taking over the road completely. One dog almost ends up beneath a car but the driver just swerves to avoid impact.\u200b\n\nThe video, made by activists from hunt monitoring group Somerset Wildlife Crime, then captures the reaction of some of the angry hunt supporters to being filmed.\n\nThere were clashes between supporters of the hunt and those activists where were filming the action in north Dorset over the weekend with police called when a camera was smashed\n\nA fox cub runs across the road during the hunt as hounds pick up the scent and give chase\n\nOn a nearby country lane, one burly saboteur with a hood gets into an argument with a hunt supporter holding a camera saying: 'Don't talk to me like that. I'll stand in your face all f***ing day.'\u200b\n\nThe cameraman then suggests that he may have been drinking alcohol to which the hunt supporter responds with: 'Have I really? Go call the police then, go on. Do it now cos I'll stand here for a month because guess one thing mate, I am completely f***ing teetotal.'\u200b\n\nHe then headbutts the camera breaking the lens as two women also square off against one another nearby.\u200b\n\nA man attempts to calm the situation down with an agreement that they each go their separate ways but not before the angry hunt supporter looks down at a swamp and tells the activist: 'You'll go swimming in a minute.'\u200b\n\nAs this is happening, a female hunt supporter allegedly elbows a female camerawoman in the chest.\u200b\n\nThe camerawoman is heard saying: 'If you do that again, to secure my own personal safety I will put my hands on you and restrain you.'\u200b\n\nThe hunt supporter retorts with: 'Touch me and I'll restrain you. You won't be getting up.'\u200b\n\nThe whole hunt can then be seen trotting off with the hounds down the country lane to have their hunt's breakfast.\u200b\n\nBobbie Armstrong, 40, from Somerset Wildlife Crime, said: 'Hunting mammals with dogs has been illegal since 2004 but it still goes on under the guise of trail hunting. Unsurprisingly, given that they use animal scent for the trail, it often ends with fox cubs falling victim to the hounds.\n\nCommenting on the unsafe road conditions, an activist said: 'This is not unusual. The hunt do this every week and are totally indifferent to anyone complaining. What is unusual is to capture it on camera.'\n\n'In this case it was a miracle that no-one was injured. There was surface water everywhere and the huntsmen were treating the busy A352 as though it were their own.\n\n'This stretch of road is covered by the national speed limit so the danger for drivers coming around bends in the wet and being met by 20 horses and hounds all over the road is obvious.\n\n'This is not unusual. The hunt do this every week and are totally indifferent to anyone complaining. What is unusual is to capture it on camera.\n\n'They see it as their right to continue this age honoured tradition of hunting animals.\n\n'We have reported the incident along with the assaults and damage to the camera to the police.'\n\nThe Blackmore and Sparkford Vale Hunt were contacted for comment but have not yet replied.\n\nDorset Police said its officers are investigating reports of road safety offences and are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.", "description": "Video taken on Saturday afternoon shows hounds and huntsmen on horseback wandering on a busy stretch of the A352 near Sherborne, Dorset, where an accident is almost caused.", "authors": ["Ross Slater For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19741428-0-image-a-10_1571146587147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
