Its loan book reached 408.7 billion reais, up 3.7% from the previous quarter, as the bank sped up its pace of auto, payroll and credit card lending.\n\nIn corporate loans, international trade lines also grew in the quarter.\n\nStill, Santander kept a lid on loans in arrears for over 90 days. Its delinquency ratio came in stable at 3%.\n\nIts net interest income grew by 3.9% from a year earlier, to 8.9 billion reais.\n\nThe bank posted a third-quarter return on equity of 21.1%, down 0.2% from the previous quarter.\n\nChief Executive Sergio Rial in October disclosed for the first time operating targets for the bank, which is the Brazilian unit of Spain's Banco Santander SA. Its loan book is expected to grow by more than 10% per year through 2022 and the bank aims to maintain its relatively high return on equity of 21%, he said, despite lower interest rates and increased competition.\n\nSantander Brasil also aims to keep growing its customer base by at least 7% per year through 2022. The bank ended September with 25.9 million clients, adding 400,000 new clients in a quarter.\n\nFee income also bolstered Santander Brasil's profit, as the bank has added new clients.\n\nTo outpace its competitors, Santander has opened small new branches dedicated to agribusiness and micro personal loans outside big cities. It added 15 branches in the third quarter, totaling 2.317 branches.\n\nIn spite of Brazil's strong results, Banco Santander SA posted a 75% decline in third-quarter profit, hit by one-off charges in the UK.\n\n($1 = 3.9985 reais) (Reporting by Carolina Mandl, editing by Louise Heavens and Chizu Nomiyama)", "description": "Banco Santander Brasil SA reported third-quarter results that beat analysts' estimates, mainly driven by the retail segment.
