Shokin had been pushed out of his position as Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2016 after pressure from Western leaders, including Biden, over concerns that he was not pursuing corruption cases.\n\nGiuliani has previously told CNN he wanted to interview Shokin in person because the Ukrainian promised to reveal dirt on Democrats.\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified before congressional lawmakers on Oct. 15\n\nKent told congressional investigators the State Department had objected to the request, and State did not grant the visa. Giuliani, Kent said, then appealed to the White House to have State reverse its decision. Shokin's visa was never granted, although Giuliani eventually spoke with Shokin over Skype.\n\nThe incident reveals how Giuliani's work to dig up dirt on Democrats went much further than previously understood -- and included an attempt to directly influence the actions of the federal government. Concerns that Giuliani was inappropriately involved in shaping and driving the administration's Ukraine policy form a significant part of the intelligence community whistleblower's complaint , which prompted the ongoing impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump.\n\nRead More", "description": "Career diplomat George Kent told congressional investigators in his closed-door testimony this week that Rudy Giuliani asked the State Department and the White House to grant a visa to the former Ukrainian official who Joe Biden had pushed to have removed when he was vice president, according to four people familiar with Kent's testimony.", "authors": ["Manu Raju", "Michael Warren", "Kylie Atwood", "Lauren Fox", "Jeremy Herb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191012134844-01-giuliani-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
