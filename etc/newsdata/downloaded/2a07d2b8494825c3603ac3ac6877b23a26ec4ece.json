Brussels, Belgium\u2019s other federal region handed the greens a majority, further complicating the chances of forming a federal coalition government.\n\nBelgium famously went 541 days with a caretaker government after the 2010 elections, a world record. Northern Ireland\u2019s Stormont Assembly has not sat for more than 1,000 days but is ineligible for the record as laws can still be passed in Westminster.\n\nTheo Francken, the former N-VA migration minister, said Ms Wilmes was a \u201crabid francophone\u201d intent on \u201csupporting French-speaking imperialism on the outskirts of Brussels.\u201d\n\nMs Wilm\u00e8s, a mother of four married to an Australian, is a fluent Dutch speaker but her position is further weakened by her liberal party losing support in the May elections to become Belgium\u2019s fourth largest party. Her promotion has been called \"a poisoned chalice\".\n\nThe N-VA walked out of Mr Michel\u2019s four party coalition in December last year after Mr Michel said he would support Belgium signing the UN Migration Pact.\n\nThe respected De Standaard newspaper said that the new prime minister was little known in Flanders but described her as charismatic and praised her for speaking good Dutch. Other Flemish commentators have criticised her for not doing more to curb government spending.\n\nLe Soir, the leading French language daily, said her elevation, which caps a rapid rise to the top for the Brussels born former local councillor, was \u201can elevator to the scaffold.\u201d\n\nMr Michel will become the new president of the European Council, a role likely to be pivotal in the Brexit process, on December 1.", "description": "Belgium\u2019s first female prime minister in 189 years of the country\u2019s history has taken office, after the resignation of Charles Michel who will succeed Donald Tusk as president of the European Council.
