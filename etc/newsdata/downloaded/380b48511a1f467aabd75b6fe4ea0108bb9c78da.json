He died in a Turkish air strike on a convoy of vehicles transporting civilians and journalists.\n\nAt least 60 civilians have now died on the Syrian side of the border, with Turkish reports putting the number of civilians dead from Kurdish shelling inside Turkey at 18.\n\nThe Observatory said pro-Ankara fighters \u201cexecuted\u201d at least nine civilians on Saturday near the Syrian town of Tal Abyad.\n\nThe Kurds said a female Kurdish party official and her driver were among those killed.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Blood, not water\u2019 \u2013\n\nAid groups have warned of another humanitarian disaster in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war if the offensive is not halted.\n\nThe UN humanitarian agency OCHA said the exodus sparked by the fighting had grown to 130,000 people and it was preparing for that figure to more than triple.\n\nFrance\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron, at a joint news conference with Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel, said the Turkish offensive \u2014 over which both countries have decided to suspend arms exports to Ankara \u2014 risked creating an \u201cunbearable humanitarian situation\u201d.\n\nMacron told reporters that he and Merkel had spoken separately with Trump and Erdogan to deliver a single, clear message: \u201cOur common wish is that the offensive must cease\u201d.\n\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, one of Ankara\u2019s main arms suppliers, said he would press for an EU ban on arms sales to Turkey.\n\nEven Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci, who heads of a breakaway state only recognised by Ankara in the north of the east Mediterranean island, chimed in, issuing a highly rare rebuke of the Turkish government.\n\n\u201cEven if we call it Peace Spring, it is blood that is spilling and not water,\u201d Akinci wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u2013 Camp \u2018without guards\u2019 \u2013\n\nOn the ground, the Kurdish administration in northern Syria said that Turkish bombardment near a camp for the displaced led to nearly 800 relatives of IS members fleeing.\n\nSome 12,000 IS fighters \u2014 Syrians, Iraqis as well as foreigners from 54 countries \u2014 are detained in Kurdish prisons, according to official Kurdish statistics.\n\nDisplacement camps host some 12,000 foreigners \u2014 8,000 children and 4,000 women.\n\n\u201cThe brutal military assault led by Turkey and its mercenaries is now taking place near a camp in Ain Issa, where there are thousands (of people) from families of IS,\u201d a Kurdish administration statement said.\n\n\u201cSome were able to escape after bombardments that targeted\u201d the camp, it said, adding that guards were attacked and the gates of the camp flung open.\n\nAin Issa camp is \u201cnow without guards\u201d and 785 relatives of IS jihadists have fled, it said.\n\nAccording to the Observatory, at least 104 SDF fighters have been killed since the start of the Turkish offensive.\n\nTurkish forces and their proxies captured Tal Abyad on Friday afternoon, which left Ras al-Ain, further east, as the last major target in the offensive.\n\nTurkey announced it had seized the key M4 highway, which looks like it might mark the southern limit of its advance in this initial phase of the invasion.", "description": "Qamishli (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 Syria\u2019s Kurds on Sunday announced a groundbreaking deal with Damascus on a Syrian troop deployment near the border", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/30b2e0_turkish-backed-forces-significant-progress-border-on-day-an-offensive-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
