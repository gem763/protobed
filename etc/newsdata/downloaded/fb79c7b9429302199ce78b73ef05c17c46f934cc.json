The European continent will never be stable or secure if we don\u2019t pacify and clarify our relations with Russia.\u201d\n\nTaking into account that Angela Merkel is leaving the political arena soon, it is Macron who is quickly becoming a major spokesman for the EU\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nTrump and Macron would make a strong team to speak for the West with the three major Eastern players: Russia, China, and India.\n\nPresently the international stability is so shaky that the G-5 group should be convened as soon as possible.\n\nThe chances for Putin\u2019s acceptance of an invitation to take part in the G-7 meeting in the US next year are close to zero. However, if Trump and Macron issue the invitations to Putin, Xi and Modi for a G-5 summit all of them would undoubtedly accept.\n\nThe G-5 is the group of world leaders that mankind urgently needs today.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
