You can form your own view.

What a waste of public money, and ours.\u201d\n\nMr Wright issued a Public Interest Intervention Notice in June following the purchase by Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel and Wondrous Investment Holdings of a 30 per cent shareholding in IDNM and a 30 per cent shareholding in LHL. IDNM is the publisher of The Independent, while LHL is the majority shareholder in publishers Evening Standard Ltd, and the two companies operate under the name ESI Media.\n\nIn its report to the culture secretary, Ofcom said it could not rule out there may be \u201cincentives and ability for the buyers to alter the accuracy or editorial stances of the publications\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We have carried out a detailed analysis of a sample of the content of both publications before and after the transactions, and there has been no evidence or substantial claims of any influence in practice to date.\n\n\u201cWe cannot, of course, rule out any suggestion that the buyers might in future, perhaps with the other shareholders\u2019 consent, seek to present more positive coverage of Saudi matters. However, this is a possibility in relation to other newspapers as well, for example to any newspaper potentially seeking to expand overseas.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ofcom noted that newspapers are not generally required to be transparent about their ownership, Ms Morgan voiced disappointment that neither company was willing to take further steps to address gaps in transparency and mitigate the risk of future inappropriate influence on editorial matters.\n\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said in a statement: \u201cOverall, the secretary of state\u2019s conclusion is that Ofcom\u2019s report goes a considerable way to satisfying her in relation to the public interest concerns relevant to this case, and based on Ofcom\u2019s conclusions she would not have referred the case to a phase two investigation.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for ESI Media said: \u201cWe are pleased, but not at all surprised, that the secretary of state has agreed with the conclusions of the CMA and Ofcom. They both found that there were no grounds for the government to take further action in relation to the investments in The Independent and Evening Standard.\n\n\u201cOfcom said there was no evidence whatsoever of interference by the investors in our editorial operations. This was after a thorough investigation, including the analysis of thousands of published articles and a public consultation.\n\n\u201cOfcom considers the safeguards already in place to protect editorial freedom to be appropriate. Similarly, the CMA concluded that there was no need to pursue a further investigation on competition grounds.\n\n\u201cWe said at the outset that this enquiry was disproportionate and unwarranted and our position hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to take the editorial independence of both our titles very seriously.\u201d", "description": "The acquisition by a Saudi investor of a share in the companies which publish The Independent and Evening Standard has had no impact on the publications\u2019 coverage of the kingdom, media regulator Ofcom has found.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/10/13/11/gettyimages-73032196.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
