More than two billion children globally are protected against polio through these vaccines, the organisation added.\n\nLow immunisation rates have contributed to the outbreak, according to the Red Cross.\n\nImmunisation coverage in the Philippines for oral polio vaccines is 66 percent but needs to be at 95 percent, WHO's Philippines representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said.\n\nSo far, only 40 percent of children under the age of five have received a polio vaccine by injection. That means three out of five children under five have not been vaccinated.\n\nRichard Gordon, a Duterte ally and chairman of the Philippines Red Cross, said in a statement that local chapters of the organisation are being mobilised to help in the mass polio vaccination campaign targeting as many as 1.2 million children.\n\nThe IFRC has released $336,700 (17.5m pesos) from its disaster relief fund to support the campaign in the southern island of Mindanao and the Metro Manila area.\n\nPast vaccine controversy\n\nThe Duterte administration has been criticised for its botched response to a dengue vaccine controversy in 2017, which observers said worried many parents who refused to have their children vaccinated for dengue, among other viruses.\n\nIn 2017, the Duterte administration banned the dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, after its French manufacturer reported that it may not be effective in some cases and could lead to severe dengue infections in some individuals who had not previously had the disease.\n\nThe polio outbreak is the third health emergency this year in the Philippines.\n\nIn February, a measles outbreak hit the country, and as of May 2019, there were an estimated 477 deaths reported, mostly young children.\n\nIt was followed by the dengue outbreak, which infected 271,480 from January to August 31 this year, and killed at least 1,107 people.", "description": "Humanitarian group warns as many as 11 million Filipino children under five face a risk of death or disability.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/9423ce7e9d3c484d93fdf466ec7945a9_18.jpg"}
