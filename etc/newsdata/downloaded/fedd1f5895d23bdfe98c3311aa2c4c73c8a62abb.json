Mens Launch in L.A. on Friday, October 11, the Australian singer-songwriter told reporters that it\u2019s \u201csafe to say\u201d that he and Miley are official. According to People, Cody noted that the two are \u201cvery happy\u201d together, adding: \u201cShe\u2019s creative. She\u2019s very passionate about what she does, and I\u2019m very similar in that sense. That\u2019s why we get along so well.\u201d\n\nCody also described his relationship with Miley as \u201cdifferent\u201d from previous girlfriends, partly because they were friends for a while before their connection turned romantic. \u201c[We] found each other again in a space where we\u2019re both not partying, working real hard, and it just keeps things healthy and it\u2019s good,\u201d he added, per People.\n\nGiven that both Cody and Miley are musicians, we have to wonder: has their spark inspired any new music? According to Cody, the answer is yes. He told reporters that he wrote a song about Miley after her recent tonsillitis surgery \u2014 and the track will be available next week. \u201cI wrote her a song this week that she\u2019s pretty much forcing me to put out,\u201d he told People. \u201cShe was like, \u2018If you don\u2019t put this sh*t out, I\u2019m putting it out on your behalf for you. I\u2019m getting your Spotify login and doing this sh*t myself.\u2019\u201d\n\nRomance rumors began floating around Cody and Miley after they were spotted smooching at a caf\u00e9 earlier this fall. In the weeks since, the two celebs have popped up on one another\u2019s Instagram feeds, and Cody even once admitted that he had a childhood crush on Miley while growing up. Destiny? Sure sounds like it.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see just what this love song entails, but if Miley is eager to share it with the world, we can only imagine it must be special.\n\nWant more from Teen Vogue?
