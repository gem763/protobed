It will be the first time Biden and Warren have appeared together at a debate.\n\nAnd the context has changed in the six weeks since the Democratic debate in Detroit: Two major mass shootings, a televised town hall on climate change and more hints of a recession on the horizon.\n\nThe first two rounds of debates featured 20 candidates over two nights, with two hours each night. The third will be more of an endurance test: 10 candidates debating for three hours. The event at Texas Southern University will be broadcast on ABC stations \u2013 and in Spanish on the Univision network \u2013 from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nIn campaign appearances and through aides, many of the candidates have already telegraphed their strategies:\n\nBiden expects to defend the record of the Obama administration \u2013 which he has rebranded the Obama-Biden administration \u2013 against charges from the rest of the field that it wasn\u2019t liberal enough on immigration, defense and health insurance. He\u2019ll try to steer the debate toward one of his strong suits, foreign policy. And he\u2019ll run on his resume. With the exception of Sanders, no one on the debate stage can match his tenure in elected office.\n\nBiden aides signaled a possible line of attack against Warren: The former vice president plans to call on all candidates to be transparent about their past business dealings. While the obvious target of the attack is President Donald Trump, it could also apply to Warren, who advised corporations on bankruptcy issues before she became known as a champion of consumer protections after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWarren says her strategy remains the same as ever: lay out detailed policy plans while making every issue an argument for bigger, structural change in American politics. And with polls showing her gaining ground on Biden, she sees no need to alter that message.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is just a better chance to talk about why I\u2019m in this fight,\u201d she told reporters in Austin, Texas, on Tuesday. She said she would define herself \u201cthe way I have all along. And that is, I\u2019m someone who will fight for your family. I\u2019m not here to fight for the rich and powerful.\u201d\n\nSanders has honed his democratic socialist message over three decades and hasn\u2019t changed it much as a candidate for president. An adviser, Jeff Weaver, said he doesn\u2019t expect the Vermont senator to pick fights \u2013 especially with Warren, a senator from neighboring Massachusetts, with whom he\u2019s had an informal nonaggression pact through the first two rounds of debates.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to offer substantive solutions to America\u2019s problems \u2013 bold, progressive plans that will energize the party and the grassroots,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nKamala Harris landed a blow on Biden in the first debate when she challenged his record on busing and school desegregation, but then faltered in the second debate when Biden fought back. This time, the California senator intends to train her eyes on a different target.\n\n\u201cKamala will take on Donald Trump directly,\u201d said Press Secretary Ian Sams. \u201cShe\u2019ll make the connection between his hatred and division and our inability to get things done for the country.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg was relatively restrained in the first two debates, staying on message even as others were mixing it up.\n\nA campaign aide said he expects Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to be more aggressive in drawing contrasts with the other candidates, but without losing the cool, Obama-like tone he\u2019s tried to cultivate.\n\nAlso qualifying for the debate: Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Andrew Yang.\n\nSome of the more aggressive debaters in June and July \u2013 Bill de Blasio and Kirsten Gillibrand \u2013 will not be there. De Blasio did not qualify, and Gillibrand dropped out of the race on Aug 28.\n\n--With assistance from Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou, Sahil Kapur, Jennifer Epstein and Laura Litvan.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Gregory Korte in Washington at gkorte@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Max Berley, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The third Democratic primary debate on Thursday will have a different chemistry than the two before it: Fewer elements, but a potentially more volatile mix.The event in Houston will be the first time the top 10 candidates will appear on the same debate stage.By virtue of his big national", "authors": ["Gregory Korte"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LqnlOVTbLWR0d047COFM2w--~B/aD03OTA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1c54cca3c6cd88419f6df10a3d7e4111", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
