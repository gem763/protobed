Three people were arrested and Aurora police and neighbors expressed disgust over the protesters\u2019 behavior. From the Colorado Independent:\n\nHundreds of Abolish ICE Denver protesters flooded the quiet Aurora subdivision Thursday night where the local immigrant detention center warden lives. They marched up to the home of the warden, Johnny Choate, chanting \u201cNazi fucks, get off our streets\u201d and \u201cpower to the people.\u201d Choate was not in his house Thursday night, according to a colleague\u2026 Aurora Police said in a tweet about an hour after the protest that three men were arrested on suspicion of obstruction, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and that they will be prosecuted Neighbors lined the streets of the Tollgate Crossing subdivision to watch, and in some cases to shout back at the marchers. The neighborhood HOA prepared for this and encouraged residents to put \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs outside their homes.\n\nThe rally lasted about 90 minutes and after it was over the Aurora PD Chief of Police described it as \u201cvile and disgusting.\u201d\n\nWhat I saw tonite by many of U who protested in residential cmty w/children was vile&disgusting. @AuroraPD protects free speech, but your message was completely lost. U were out of your league. My cops were simply AMAZING despite your attempts to bait them into a confrontation! pic.twitter.com/nMwvsZekNH \u2014 Chief Nick Metz (@APDChiefMetz) September 20, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s the kind of thing he\u2019s referring to.\n\nYouTube user \u201cMunkay 83\u201d again tells @AuroraPD to take out their guns and shoot each other. Does #AbolishIce not understand PD are there to protect their right to \u201cpeacefully\u201d protest? This is disgusting @GovofCO @FBIDenver @TheJusticeDept #StandWithIce pic.twitter.com/4eeoKi8D4g \u2014 Rosie memos (@almostjingo) September 20, 2019\n\nMore:\n\nHere\u2019s an #AbolishIce /Denver commie punk shouting at an Aurora police officer to \u201cgo home and swallow a bullet.\u201d #StandWithICE #BackTheBlue https://t.co/fQQK5HjFMh \u2014 Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) September 20, 2019\n\nBut local residents expressed support for the police:\n\nIt truly was sickening. Thank you for acknowledging our officers and their professionalism tonight. We also commend the community for their role in keeping everyone safe and their tolerance during this disruption to their ordinarily quiet community. https://t.co/1tr9enlQq5 \u2014 Aurora Police Dept (@AuroraPD) September 20, 2019\n\nThank you for your support. We are relieved no one was injured and are grateful for the community who endured so much disruption this evening. https://t.co/6ZYlGvCnit \u2014 Aurora Police Dept (@AuroraPD) September 20, 2019\n\n#YourSupportMatters We have received so many messages of thanks from residents of our @tgcmd_org neighborhood. We know this was very disruptive for your ordinarily quiet community. We also commend everyone for not getting baited into the agitators efforts to incite everyone. https://t.co/G9WP25iQGz \u2014 Aurora Police Dept (@AuroraPD) September 20, 2019\n\nThere have been protests outside the ICE facility for months but this protest was organized as an escalation of that effort. Here\u2019s an interview with the organizer:\n\nThis is straight out of the far-left playbook. No one is name-checking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez but she\u2019s clearly an inspiration for these protesters.\n\nFinally, here\u2019s a local report on the protest which includes some reaction from neighbors who are, understandably, not happy at having a bunch of noisy communists marching in front of their homes:", "description": "\"It truly was sickening.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/anti-ice-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
