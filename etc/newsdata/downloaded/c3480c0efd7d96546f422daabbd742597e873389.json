He comes into the postseason having given up just eight earned runs in his last 30 innings.\n\nBut inside the Nationals clubhouse, there was no debate over the decision: If Scherzer is healthy enough to pitch, he gets the ball for the biggest game Washington has played so far this season.\n\nScherzer \u2014 11-7, 2.92 ERA in 27 starts, 243 strikeouts in 172.1 innings \u2014 missed a month of the season with shoulder and back ailments and had a rocky finish, surrendering 17 earned runs in his last 29.2 innings.\n\nNot exactly a hot hand.\n\nSo why are the Nationals so confident Martinez made the right call?\n\nThink of it like the Jimmy Chitwood situation from \u201cHoosiers\u201d \u2014 Scherzer\u2019s teammates expect him to be the guy. In a winner-take-all moment, they want him out there. He is the alpha dog in the clubhouse, one of the leaders of this team with a fiery competitive streak that makes it near-impossible to picture him sitting and watching, were someone else handed this opportunity.\n\nTeammates won\u2019t say it publicly, out of respect to Strasburg and Patrick Corbin, Washington\u2019s other powerful starting pitchers. But this is Scherzer\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cMax has been the ace here for several years,\u201d Howie Kendrick said. \u201cHis resume speaks for itself. Now Strasburg had a great year, and we have other guys who could do it. And remember, it may be the guy who finishes who is the most important \u2014 like we had with the (Los Angeles) Dodgers when (Clayton) Kershaw came in the game in relief (to close out Game 5 of the 2016 National League Division Series against Washington).\u201d\n\nYes, in a wild card game \u2014 postseason madness \u2014 the starting pitchers may be long forgotten by the end of the night. But for now, Scherzer is the man Martinez picked to hold his team\u2019s hopes and dreams in the palm of his right hand.\n\nThe manager, for his part, cautioned against reading too much into his choice.\n\n\u201cFor me it didn\u2019t matter if it was him or Strasburg, they (his teammates) appreciate them both the same. For me, it was knowing that Max was ready. He had a week off, his last outing he threw well and wanted to go back out there. That tells me he feels strong and everything is back to normal.\u201d\n\nSo the Nationals have their man, but the thing is, their man isn\u2019t exactly the Paul Bunyan of postseason baseball. Scherzer\u2019s been good, and he\u2019s been bad.\n\nIn four American League Division Series with Detroit, Scherzer went 3-1 with a 2.79 ERA, but 1-2 with 4.61 ERA in three AL Championship Series \u2014 his most famous being the 11 hits and nine runs he gave up in 8.1 innings in a 2011 loss to the Texas Rangers.\n\nThat was before he became Mad Max, the three-time Cy Young winner and one of the most feared pitchers in baseball during his five years in Washington.\n\nBut even here, his postseason numbers, don\u2019t mesh with the madness \u2014 eight earned runs and 14 hits in 19.1 innings pitched. Of course, that includes that bizarre Game 5 against the Chicago Cubs when Scherzer came into the game in relief, and, after getting two outs, surrendered four runs on three straight two-out hits, an intentional walk, a disputed passed ball strikeout, catcher\u2019s interference and a hit batter.\n\nEven with that memory forever seared into Nationals history, is there anyone else fans would rather see on the mound for Washington Tuesday night?\n\n\u201cI put myself in this position to be ready to be able to give whatever I need to the team tomorrow,\u201d Scherzer told reporters Monday, all business. \u201cMy arm has responded. I feel like I can pitch deep into the game. Tomorrow, however long Davey will let me pitch, I\u2019ll pitch.\u201d\n\nWhen you\u2019re the alpha, that\u2019s what\u2019s expected.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
