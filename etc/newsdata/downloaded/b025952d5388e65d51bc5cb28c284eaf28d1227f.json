REUTERS/Matthew Childs\n\nEngland coach Eddie Jones had surprisingly dropped Ford to the bench for their quarter-final against Australia, then reinstated his 10-12 partnership with Farrell for the semi-final against the All Blacks in Yokohama on Saturday.\n\nFord was increasingly influential in the second half as he kept New Zealand pinned inside their own territory before England ended the All Blacks 18-match World Cup winning streak with a superb 19-7 victory.\n\nThe 26-year-old also took over the goal kicking from Farrell, who was injured early in the game, and slotted four penalties, and Pollard was impressed with what he saw.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll probably go Ford-Farrell again, its a pretty good combo,\u201d South Africa\u2019s flyhalf Pollard said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much better than that but we\u2019ll see in the week.\u201d\n\nPollard was equally influential in his own side\u2019s 19-16 victory over Wales in the second semi-final on Sunday as he also slotted four penalties.\n\nWhile the Springboks backs and loose forwards would look at the influence Ford and Farrell, they were only a small part of the approach they would need to consider on Saturday in Yokohama, Pollard added.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t prepare around that (combination), we\u2019ll prepare around the bigger picture,\u201d Pollard added.\n\n\u201cThey played unbelievably well. Physically they stepped it up to a new level. We\u2019re going to have to stop them.\n\n\u201cIts going to be another gain-line battle and its two sides that pride themselves on a good kicking game as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good chess match.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa coach Rassie Erasmus was also impressed with the way England had \u201cdismantled\u201d New Zealand in the semi-final and he was certain they were a different side from that which beat the Springboks 12-11 at Twickenham last November.\n\n\u201cWe have played England four times in the last 18 months and it is 2-2. So we are accustomed to the way they play,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cThey are much better than when we last played them. You could see it.\u201d\n\nThe breakdown battle would also be immense, according to number eight Duane Vermeulen, with the twin openside flankers of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill a nuisance over the ball and destructive in the tackle.\n\n\u201cThey were fantastic, they got a hell of a lot of turnovers. That puts a team on the front foot,\u201d Vermeulen added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for us. We\u2019re definitely going to spend a little bit of time on the breakdown but we\u2019re pretty happy with the way things are going.\u201d", "description": "South Africa are expecting George Ford to play flyhalf again in the Rugby World Cup final with England captain Owen Farrell outside him after the pair were impressive in their demolition of New Zealand in the semi-finals, according to Handre Pollard.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445781643&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0J5-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
