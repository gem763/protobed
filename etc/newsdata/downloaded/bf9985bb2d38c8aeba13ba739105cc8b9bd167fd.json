That\u2019s why as soon as I got to them, I hit the front and tried to burn them off. But they were just waiting for the kick.\n\n\u201cI knew this was the pace I\u2019d got and I was trying everything to lift it but I just couldn\u2019t. To be even closer than last time, it\u2019s gutting. I really wanted that medal and that\u2019s what I trained for. But it wasn\u2019t to be on the night.\u201d\n\nHawkins, 27, had shown how serious he was about getting a medal by training in up to 39 degrees in his shed.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nIn the event the heat and humidity was not quite as brutally punishing as it had been for the majority of these championships.\n\nHe ran a superb race, giving the African favourites the fright of their lives, before stopping the clock on 2:10.57.\n\nLelisa Desisa, finishing just 17 seconds ahead the Scottish braveheart, headed an Ethiopian one-two, with Mosinet Geremew second and Amos Kipruto of Kenya third.", "description": "\"To be even closer than last time, it\u2019s gutting.
