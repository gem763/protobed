The phishing email users spoofing to make it look as if it comes from a valid domain.\n\nThe .ZIP file is a gateway to a .TXT extension which runs a PowerShell script when activated, executing the installation of the malware onto the victim's Windows machine.\n\nAs part of the process, the dropped .EXE file will sleep for 20 seconds in an effort to avoid being discovered before installing itself into a new Windows folder.\n\nRemcos also adds itself to the auto-start group in the system registry to help maintain persistence on the infected victim by automatically starting when the machine is turned on.\n\nWhen the malware is running, it records all information entered in the web browser, providing information on what websites the user is visiting and what they enter into the site \u2013 enabling the attacker to see and steal usernames and passwords.\n\nNot only does this immediately compromise the victim by allowing the attacker access to accounts, the information could be exploited in further attacks or even sold on dark web forums.\n\nResearchers have detailed the full capabilities of the new version of Remcos along with its Indicators of Compromise in their analysis of the malware.\n\nREAD MORE ON CYBER CRIME", "description": "Researchers detail new attacks using a new version of keylogging and information stealing Remcos malware.", "authors": ["Danny Palmer"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/03/017fe9bd-fc01-4e76-a133-bc16cdbb3a29/thumbnail/770x578/387c6ce983172cc2bc873c8868bbd638/hacker-hands-in-the-shadows-istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
