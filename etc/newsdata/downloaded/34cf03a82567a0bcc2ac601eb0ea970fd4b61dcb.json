Greenland has flashed onto the presidential radar because the United States is rushing to build out new critical minerals supply chains to break its dependency on China.\n\nDependency on China\n\nThe Pentagon has been worrying for years about the United States' growing dependence on China and what it terms other \"unreliable\" countries for a broad spectrum of minerals.\n\nSuch concerns were thrown into sharp relief in May, when Chinese president Xi Jinping used a visit to a rare earths magnet plant to send a thinly veiled warning about the potential costs to the United States of escalating trade tensions.\n\nThose costs are potentially very high indeed since the United States and the rest of the world are almost 100 per cent reliant on China's rare earths production and exports.\n\nEven the only operating US rare earths mine, Mountain Pass in California, has to ship its product to China for processing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far at least, China hasn't used its \"rare earths gun\".\n\nThe country's exports are running steady albeit marginally off last year's pace, while shipments of rare earth magnets to the United States hit a three-year high in August.\n\nBut China's sabre-rattling has spurred a scramble by the United States to seek out potential new suppliers for both rare earths and the other 34 minerals identified as \"critical\" by the Department of the Interior.\n\nAll are \"critical\" both in terms of their military applications and in terms of US import dependency, particularly when that dependency is on countries classified as potentially hostile.\n\nThe United States is now on an accelerated path towards building out more reliable and sustainable supply chains.\n\nA key part of that process, as laid out by the Commerce Department's critical minerals strategy, published in June this year, is forming alliances with \"friendly\" suppliers.\n\nCanada and Australia\n\nTop of the list are Canada and Australia. High-level discussions have already taken place with both countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed \"ways to improve mineral security and (...) work more closely to ensure secure and reliable supply chains\" at a meeting in June.\n\nThe official Canadian press statement also noted that Trudeau \"highlighted the importance of Canadian uranium to North American energy security\", a pointed reference to an ongoing US investigation into uranium import dependency.\n\nThe two countries also clashed over US import duties on Canadian aluminium until it was exempted from the tariff hit-list in May.\n\nSuch diplomatic jostling aside, however, Canada has a lot to offer the United States when it comes to supply critical minerals.\n\nCanada is a already a leading producer of nickel and cobalt and has another 70 advanced projects for both metals, according to a July presentation by Hilary Morgan, director international affairs at Natural Resources Canada.\n\nAlso ticking the US metallic wish list are Canada's 16 advanced rare earths projects and its 17 advanced and near-stage lithium projects.\n\nAustralia, meanwhile, is already a growing lithium production powerhouse and in the form of Lynas Corp boasts the only vertically integrated rare earths producer outside of China.\n\n\"The US increasingly requires critical minerals to serve its growing high-tech industries and Australia possesses the raw materials to meet this need,\" boasts an Australian government report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiversified supplies key\n\nBut as Trump's interest in Greenland shows, the United States is looking anywhere and everywhere to diversify its critical minerals imports.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo met late September at the United Nations Assembly with representatives of nine other countries under the banner of the newly-established Energy Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI).\n\nAs the name implies, the specific focus is on new-energy minerals such as lithium, cobalt and copper. The aim is to share \"best practices on minerals management and governance\" to promote \"integrated and resilient supply chains\" as the electric vehicle revolution builds momentum.\n\nThe list of participating countries includes major existing producer countries such as Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia but also potential future suppliers such as Botswana, Namibia and the Philippines.\n\nCentral to US minerals strategic thinking is the need to move beyond relying on any one country, even if it is a \"friendly\" one.\n\n\"We are looking for any source of supply outside China. We want diversity. We don't want a single-source producer,\" Jason Nie, a material engineer with the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), told Reuters on the sidelines of the Argus US Specialty Metals conference in Chicago.\n\nThe DLA is charged not only with managing the Pentagon's materials stockpile but also with trying to facilitate financing and offtake arrangements for potential new projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is another part of a multi-pronged US minerals strategy which will redraw the global map.\n\nGreenland may not be for sale, as President Trump has found out. But its minerals are.\n\nAnd it won't be the last resource-rich country to get a US tap on its shoulder in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nReuters", "description": "Greenland bid highlights dependence on China for rare earths elements, and the US is looking to Australia, among others, to help diversify its supply lines.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_13/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/42e5a4249eb6ea56b72008d9e1511148952eef08", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
