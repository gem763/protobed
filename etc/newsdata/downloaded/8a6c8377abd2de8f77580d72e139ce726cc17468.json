Bank of Spain Cuts Economic Growth Forecasts Through 2021\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here.\n\nSpain\u2019s central bank cut its economic growth forecasts, an acknowledgment that even one of the euro region\u2019s fastest growing economies isn\u2019t immune to the uncertainty that\u2019s gripped the global economy.\n\nThe Bank of Spain now expects expansion of 2% this year, with a further slowdown to 1.7% in 2020. That compares with June projections for 2.4% and 1.9%.\n\nIt blamed the downgrade on weaker-than-expected job growth across most sectors and heightened global uncertainty stemming from Brexit negotiations and trade tensions, which has hit investment. Bank of Spain research head Oscar Arce also said it also reflected recent revisions to past economic data.\n\nDespite the lowered expectations, Spain\u2019s growth is still set to outpace other major euro-area economies. A manufacturing slump has put Germany on the brink of recession and Italy\u2019s economy has stagnated.\n\nWhile Spain is in its sixth year of solid expansion, the new numbers underscore the concern among economists and Spanish voters that the period could be coming to an end. That means lawmakers are running out of opportunities to seize on the good times and implement major policy changes that could boost long-term prospects.\n\nMonths of political paralysis and years of weak minority governments have fed those concerns, and another general election is due to take place in November. Such uncertainty, Arce said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t help economic growth.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s unemployment rate has declined to 14%, but further progress could be slow. Economists don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely to fall much further in the coming years because of deep-seated structural problems such as an over-reliance on short-term contracts.\n\nThe Bank of Spain sees the rate slipping to around 13% by the end of 2021.", "description": "Bank of Spain Cuts Economic Growth Forecasts Through 2021", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED2T0HO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
