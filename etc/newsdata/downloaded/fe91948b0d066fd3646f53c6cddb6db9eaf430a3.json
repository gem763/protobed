They performed CPR but were unable to revive him.\n\nNeighbour Cassandra Aiono said she heard the man screaming shortly before he collapsed\n\n'It was just one man screaming really loudly,' neighbour Cassandra Aiono told The Sunday Telegraph.\n\nThe man, who neighbours described as of Cambodian appearance, has now been formally identified and authorities are now informing his family of the death.\n\nFrom the initial inspection fire crews said the blaze caused extensive damage to the lounge room, laundry and kitchen area but the house remained largely untouched.\n\nDanni-Maree Giles, 23, said her mother previously lived in the public housing home but was forced to leave after taking in too many squatters.\n\n'There were five or six people coming and going and we could not get rid of them so we just had to get my mother out,' Ms Giles said.\n\nDanni-Maree Giles, 23, said her mother previously lived in the public housing home (pictured) but was forced to leave after taking in too many squatters\n\n'They are all homeless and mum felt sorry for them - but they took over the house.'\n\n'It's unfortunate that it's happened and it's just heart breaking... I can't believe it,' neighbour Rose Mokhtal told Nine News.\n\nShe said the man's death had left the children on the street 'devastated', and described him as 'friendly and kind'.\n\nThe cause of the fire has been deemed as not suspicious but police are still unsure of exactly how the blaze began.\n\nParramatta duty commander Inspector Craig Davies told reporters the small fire may have slowly burned throughout the morning.\n\n'There are holes in the floor as well, so the fire had been burning for quite some time before anyone had noticed,' Mr Davies said.", "description": "The fire started early in the morning at a house in\u00a0Cabramatta West, Sydney's South-West and neighbours said they heard screaming before fire and ambulance crews arrived.", "authors": ["Tom Place For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/10/19621962-0-image-a-82_1570870977094.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
