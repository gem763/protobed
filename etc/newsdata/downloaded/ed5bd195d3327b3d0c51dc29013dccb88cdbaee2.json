On rare occasions, a trustee comes to define an institution, as Mr. Lauder has the Whitney.\n\nOver four decades, Mr. Lauder, who is the elder son of the cosmetics impresario Est\u00e9e Lauder and went on to run her company, has been the museum\u2019s biggest donor, contributing large sums of money as well as major works of art. Although he has a deep affection for the Whitney\u2019s former home, designed by Marcel Breuer, on Madison Avenue and initially opposed the idea of a move downtown, Mr. Lauder not only came around but donated $131 million to the new building in the Meatpacking District, which was ultimately named after him.\n\nEven as chairman emeritus and well into his 80s, Mr. Lauder has continued to wield remarkable power at the Whitney, if lately on a less day-to-day basis. Mr. Griffin, when asked to explain his reason for deciding to stay on the Whitney board after resigning, provided a statement that made it sound as if Mr. Lauder was still the man in charge, and made no mention of the museum\u2019s current leaders. \u201cI have great admiration for Leonard Lauder\u2019s leadership in building the Whitney into one of the greatest institutions of American art in the world,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI will continue to support Leonard\u2019s vision for the museum, and am proud to serve with him on its board.\u201d\n\nFrom board member to broad target\n\nIn 1996, Mr. Kanders, a former money manager who had ended up in the eyeglass and lens business, bought part of a company called American Body Armor. It was his first stop on a journey that would remake him into a provider of law enforcement equipment and military supplies. Today his company, the Safariland Group, makes a wide variety of products including bulletproof vests, bomb-defusing robots and gun holsters.\n\nBut it was one product \u2014 tear gas \u2014 that labeled him Museum Enemy No. 1.\n\nLate in 2018, at a time when President Trump was warning of an illegal immigration \u201ccrisis,\u201d United States Customs and Border Protection agents used tear gas on asylum seekers at the Mexican border, firing into a crowd that included children. The website Hyperallergic reported that the canisters had been manufactured by Mr. Kanders\u2019s company.\n\nDays later, about 100 Whitney staff members, ranging from front desk personnel to senior curators, signed a letter. \u201cWe work to bring in artists who are immigrants and artists of color to the collection,\u201d it said. \u201cUpon learning of Kanders\u2019s business dealings, many of us working on these initiatives feel uncomfortable in our positions.\u201d", "description": "A recent protest at the Whitney that drummed out a vice chairman exposed the symbiotic, but potentially problematic, relationship that museums have with some trustees.", "authors": ["Robin Pogrebin", "Elizabeth A.
