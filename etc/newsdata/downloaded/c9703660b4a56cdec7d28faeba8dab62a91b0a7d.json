Hudgens, who has her own fitness collection with the activewear company Avia, told Women's Health that she tries to attend at least three yoga classes per week, and depends on SoulCycle, pilates and circuit training to round out her exercise. In fact, after having gained 20 pounds for her role in the 2013 film Gimme Shelter, Hudgens attended two SoulCycle classes a day.\n\nHudgens also opened up to People regarding her eating habits, and how she switches between the keto diet and intermittent fasting.\n\n\u201cIntermittent fasting is great, because when I am fasting \u2014 those first two weeks are definitely rough, I\u2019m not going to lie, but after that I feel more grounded and powerful in my workouts.

I\u2019m always making sure I\u2019m getting those healthy fats in, so I eat a LOT of almond butter. You feel really energetic and supported on the keto diet.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Vanessa Hudgens showed off well-toned physique at the Carolina Herrera show at New York Fashion Week.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4w1Xf69tCndZ1TM8lcOgIA--~B/aD02MDAwO3c9Mzk4NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f3bb8ac0-d341-11e9-a3b7-0f44e25fab57", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
