French President Emmanual Macron's shift came after a phone call with Johnson on Sunday, according to multiple reports.\n\nUnder the terms of the offer, the UK will be able to terminate the extension at any point provided parliament ratifies the withdrawal agreement and approved a deal.\n\nIt represents an embarrassing climbdown for the prime minister, who made a \"do or die\" pledge to take Britain out of the EU on October 31.\n\nHe was forced to send a letter to Brussels requesting an extension earlier in October after parliament passed a law compelling him to accept an extension if he was unable to ratify his deal in parliament by October 19. The move was designed to ensure Johnson was unable to force a no-deal Brexit in October without the approval of parliament.\n\nIt comes after the House of Commons voted in favour of the legislation required to deliver Brexit but declined to support Johnson's attempt to fast-track it through parliament in October, meaning he was legally required to request an extension.\n\nThe focus will now turn to whether MPs approve Johnson's request for a general election on Monday afternoon. The vote, to be made under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, would require a two-thirds Commons majority of 434 MPs.\n\nThe opposition Labour party have told their MPs to abstain or vote against the motion, meaning it is unlikely to pass unless there is a change of heart from the Labour leadership.\n\nNOW WATCH: Here's a full reading of the phone call memo between Trump and Ukraine", "description": "The EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit until at least next year after Boris Johnson was forced reluctantly to seek an extension.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2posyeMH.R6qINwkCTyAKg--~B/aD02ODM7dz05MTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/21008828bbbb41f1e8931996ed1eb7c8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
