There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period,\" the actress said in a statement.\n\n\"My hope now is that my family, my friends and my community will forgive me for my actions,\" Huffman added.\n\nFederal prosecutors had asked that Huffman be given a month in jail.\n\nHer defense team recommended a sentence of a year's probation and a US$20,000 fine.\n\nHer guilty plea avoided what would have been a well-publicised trial and potentially lengthier jail sentence.\n\nThe crime is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a fine of as much as US$250,000.\n\nHuffman announced her intention to plead guilty in April, saying she was \"ashamed\" of what she had done.\n\nThe scandal erupted in March when the ringleader behind the scam, William \"Rick\" Singer, admitted running the elaborate system which ranged from cheating in entrance exams to bribing coaches to help non-athletic students get scholarships.\n\nAuthorities say he was paid about US$25 million to bribe coaches and university administrators. He has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with authorities.\n\nHis sentencing will take place on Sept 19.\n\nIn June, a former Stanford University sailing coach was the first to be sentenced, receiving two years of supervised release.\n\nJohn Vandemoer, 41, had pleaded guilty in March for accepting payments to the programme totaling US$610,000 \"in exchange for corrupting the admissions process of a major university,\" prosecutors said.\n\nA Chinese family admitted to paying Singer US$6.5 million to guarantee their daughter admission to Stanford, with Vandemoer's help, though the mother said she was duped into believing the sum was a charitable donation.\n\nBesides Stanford, some of the universities targeted in the elaborate cheating scam include University of Southern California, Yale, Georgetown and UCLA. None of the schools or the students have been charged in the case.\n\nActress Lori Loughlin from 1980s-90s sitcom \"Full House\" has also been accused. She and her husband have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BOSTON] Actress Felicity Huffman was given two weeks jail time Friday for paying bribes to help her daughter gain admission to a prestigious American university, the first high-profile figure to be sentenced in a cheating scandal that rocked America. .
