Kim Jong Un can spin this personnel change in Washington as a win in North Korean domestic politics. That would increase the likelihood of denuclearization talks restarting soon.\u201d\n\nHarry Kazianis, a North Korea expert at Washington\u2019s Center for the National Interest think tank, said Trump was now free to find a national security adviser opposed to wars of regime change and willing to back a diplomatic track with North Korea.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s North Korea envoy, Stephen Biegun, a firm advocate of engagement with Pyongyang, is among the names that have been floated as possible successors to Bolton.\n\nBolton has not been the only target of North Korean rhetoric.\n\nNorth Korea's official media has repeatedly denounced U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and urged Trump to replace him with a \"more mature\" interlocutor. Last month it called Pompeo a \"diehard toxin\" who only complicated talks. (Read story here )\n\nSpeaking after Bolton\u2019s departure, Pompeo said there were \u201cmany times\u201d that they had disagreed, but countries should not expect changes in approach.\n\n\u201cSomeone asked, would the policy be different absent any individual being here,\u201d Pompeo said to reporters at the White House.\n\n\u201cThese have been the president\u2019s policies. We give him our best wisdom, we share with him our understanding ... but I don\u2019t think that any leader around the world should make any assumption that because some one of us departs that President Trump\u2019s foreign policy will change in a material way,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nTrump has received plaudits and criticisms for his willingness to engage Kim John Un directly in three meetings since June last year, the first between leaders of two countries that have remained in a technical state of hostilities since the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nLittle progress has been made in getting Kim to give up his weapons programs, but Trump has repeatedly pointed to North Korea\u2019s freeze in nuclear and long-range missile tests since 2017 as evidence of the success of his efforts.\n\nAll that nearly fell apart in Hanoi when Trump followed Bolton's advice and handed Kim a piece of paper that bluntly called for the transfer of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and bomb fuel to the United States. (Read story here)\n\nThe document effectively reprised Bolton\u2019s long-held and hard-line \u201cLibya model\u201d of unilateral denuclearization that North Korea has repeatedly rejected and analysts said would have been seen by Kim as insulting and provocative.\n\nWhile North Korea has said it is willing to resume talks, Kim has given a year-end deadline for Washington to take a new approach.\n\nRegardless of Bolton\u2019s departure, Washington has given no indication that it will soften its demand for North Korea\u2019s ultimate denuclearization, even though with Bolton gone, the risky all-or-nothing gambit is unlikely to be repeated.", "description": "Among those unlikely to be mourning John Bolton's departure as U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser are officials in North Korea who have denounced him as a \"war maniac\" and \"human scum\" for his attempts to end Pyongyang's nuclear program.", "authors": ["David Brunnstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428462623&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF89240", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
