This new addition, \u201cPowerRename,\u201d gives you a simple method for batch-renaming files within File Explorer. It\u2019s free, easy, and worth the 10 seconds it takes to install on your system.\n\nTo get started, hit up Microsoft\u2019s GitHub for PowerToys and download the latest release. Once you\u2019ve installed it, all three PowerToys\u2014FancyZones, PowerRename, and Shortcut Guide\u2014should be enabled by default, but you can check this by right-clicking the tiny icon in your taskbar and selecting \u201cSettings.\u201d\n\nAssuming PowerRename is working, all you have to do is pull up File Explorer, select a few files you\u2019d like to rename, right-click, and select \u201cPowerRename\u201d from the context menu.\n\nFrom there, PowerRename is easy to figure out. Type in whatever text you want to change to in the top field (\u201cSearch for\u201d), and put whatever text you want to change in the bottom field (\u201cReplace with\u201d)\u2014as you just saw in the above animation.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nWhat I love about PowerRename is that you\u2019ll get a real-time preview of your changes in the (appropriately named) Preview window, so you can make sure what whatever it is you\u2019re trying to do\u2014with whatever options you select, if you use those\u2014works out perfectly.\n\nSpeaking of, if you\u2019re curious what those options do, here\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s quick descriptions:\n\nUse Regular Expressions: If checked, the Search field will be interpreted as a regular expression. If not checked, the Search field will be used as a text to be replaced with the text in the Replace field.\n\nCase Sensitive: If checked, the text specified in the Search field will only match text in the items if the text is the same case. By default we match case insensitive.\n\nMatch All Occurrences: If checked, all matches of the text in Search field will be replaced with the Replace text. Otherwise, only the first instance of the Search for text in the item will be replaced (left to right).\n\nExclude Files: Files will not be included in the operation.\n\nExclude Folders: Folders will not be included in the operation.\n\nExclude Subfolder Items: Items within folders will not be included in the operation. By default, all subfolder items are included.\n\nEnumerate Items: Appends a numeric suffix to file names that were modified in the operation. Ex: foo.jpg -> foo (1).jpg\n\nItem Name Only: Only the file name portion (not the file extension) is modified by the operation. Ex: txt.txt -> NewName.txt\n\nItem Extension Only: Only the file extension portion (not the file name) is modified by the operation. Ex: txt.txt -> txt.NewExtension\n\nThough, honestly, this all makes PowerRename sound much more complicated than it is. You\u2019ll probably be fine with the basic search/replace functionality, and that preview? It makes me kiss my fingers like a chef. What a great little utility.", "description": "Microsoft has dropped a brand-new open-source Windows 10 PowerToy, and it\u2019s just as fun and useful as the other two.
