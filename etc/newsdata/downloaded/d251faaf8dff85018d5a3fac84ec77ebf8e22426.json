Uefa imposed sanctions after incidents during Bulgaria\u2019s matches against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June.\n\nBalakov, Bulgaria\u2019s manager, also accused England of increasing tension in the build-up to the match after the Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham claimed that Gareth Southgate\u2019s side would walk off the pitch if they are on the receiving end of racist chanting.\n\nEngland\u2019s Gareth Southgate seeks to calm racism row with Bulgaria Read more\n\nIn response last week the Bulgarian football union president, Boris Mihaylov, urged Uefa to take action against England, and Balakov \u2013 a member of the celebrated side that reached the semi-finals of the 1994 World Cup \u2013 was similarly dismissive about the potential for any issues.\n\n\u201cWhat I can say is that I don\u2019t think we have a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Bulgarian championship, we have a lot of players of different ethnicities and skin colour. I don\u2019t think we have as big a problem like, for example, England do. I would like to focus on football because at the end of the day we are all civilised Europeans and we are all working for this sport. That is all that matters.\u201d\n\nAsked to elaborate on his comments about England, Balakov said: \u201cWhat I meant was that in the Bulgarian championship we\u2019ve not had such problems. While there have been incidents in various levels of English football involving racism, which I consider something normal because it\u2019s a big country with a very diverse population. But we don\u2019t have this problem in Bulgaria, I can assure you of that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England\u2019s manager Gareth Southgate said: \u2018I\u2019ve always said we have as many issues in our own country to resolve as anywhere else.\u2019 Photograph: Vadim Ghird\u0103/AP\n\nUefa has ordered that 5,000 of the 46,340 seats at the Vasil Levski Stadium will remain empty for the game against England, reduced to 3,000 against the Czech Republic a month later. The sanction for \u201cracist behaviour\u201d related to a banner supporting Bulgarian national resistance in Prague and what the Bulgarian press officer described as \u201ca third party chant by a small group of people\u201d during the 3-2 home defeat by Kosovo.\n\nAsked how confident he was that home supporters will behave, Balakov said: \u201cMy personal opinion is I can never be certain of what will happen. But I do not think we should continue talking about something that has not even happened yet and to increase the tension in the build-up to the game. You said what you had to say, we replied and said what we had to say and I think we should leave it at that.\u201d\n\nThe last time England played in Sofia in 2011, Bulgaria were fined \u20ac40,000 after monkey chants were aimed at Ashley Young, Ashley Cole and Theo Walcott, with Harry Kane admitting that the players had discussed how they would respond if there is any repeat on Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a protocol in place but from my point of view and the players\u2019 point of view we\u2019re here to do a job on the football pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully we don\u2019t have to cross that bridge.\u201d\n\nSouthgate said: \u201cWe are guests in another country. I\u2019ve always said we have as many issues in our own country to resolve as anywhere else. We had to prepare our players because of what happened in Montenegro but outside of that we trust the authorities to make sure everything is in place.\u201d\n\nBulgaria go into the match bottom of Group A having failed to register a victory in their six matches so far but are already assured of a playoff after finishing second in their Nations League group last year.\n\nBalakov, who spent most of his playing career at the German side Stuttgart but also served under Sir Bobby Robson at Sporting Lisbon, took over in May and has lost four of his five matches so far, with the exception being the 0-0 draw against Montenegro in Podgorica on Friday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Kane scores from the spot during England\u2019s 4-0 win over Bulgaria at Wembley Stadium. Photograph: Robin Jones/Getty Images\n\nThe manager admitted he is hoping to take advantage of England\u2019s frailty at the back but was wary of being too positive about their chances of causing an upset after a disastrous display from his own defenders in the 4-0 defeat at Wembley in September.\n\nHe said: \u201cEvery team has a weak spot and if we can counter the English team\u2019s dynamism and answer it then we will have a chance. In terms of individual and team quality, the difference is extremely big but we have to count on the team\u2019s character and everyone being at their best to get a good result.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely hope to exploit those defensive mistakes but we had similar problems in London. Two or three of the goals came from our own mistakes so I can definitely answer your question after tomorrow\u2019s game.\u201d", "description": "Bulgaria\u2019s manager, Krasimir Balakov, pointed to \u2018incidents of racism\u2019 in English football as he responded to England player fears of racist chanting before the Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia", "authors": ["Ed Aarons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcef07bedeab20de47f33c0fed351b7a765c763a/0_119_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=90f96df7a385c36ff017845f65565bfa", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
