Not all the Iran weapons hit their target in Saudi Arabia. Some fell short.\n\nThe U.S. Patriot missile defense system does not have 360-degree coverage.\n\nThe Patriot radar can only point in one direction. Most of Saudi Arabia\u2019s air defense systems are in the south to protect from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who have launched rockets, drones and missiles into the Kingdom for years.\n\nOne official called the area in Saudi Arabia where the Iranian forces hit, a \u201cblind spot.\u201d\n\nU.S. teams are on the ground in Saudi Arabia collecting the debris from the weapons used in the attack, which knocked out half the Kingdom\u2019s oil capacity. Some officials have said Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen could have also launched a small attack into southern Saudi Arabia, but that the main attack came from Iran.\n\n\u201cIran has a long history of testing its strength. But they never climb too high up the escalation ladder. At a certain point, when the world says enough, they come back down,\u201d a senior administration official told Fox News. \u201cWe do see a role for the UN Security Council to play. Saudi was attacked and it would be appropriate for them to call upon the Council. But we first need to gather the releasable information.\u201d\n\nLOCKED AND LOADED: MILITARY OPTIONS ON TABLE IN RESPONSE TO SAUDI OIL ATTACK AS TRUMP SEEKS TO AVOID WAR\n\nThe attack against the oil facilities last weekend showed 17 direct hits to the oil tanks and other infrastructure, according to satellite imagery released by the Trump administration, showing much greater proficiency with their more advanced weapons, officials say.\n\nOfficials and intelligence analysts have shot down Houthi rebel claims that they fired them from Yemen territory. Iraq categorically denied that the attacks came from within its borders, despite it being a geographic possibility. U.S. surveillance is not reported to have detected a boat in the Persian Gulf that technically could have been utilized as a discharge pad.\n\nThe investigation has thus turned more to Iranian terrain \u2013 and the probability that it was not just drones used to decimate at least 17 targets and knock out 5.7 million barrels of daily oil production \u2013 but cruise missiles.\n\nThe Houthis may have been involved in a small attack, but it is a diversion from the main culprit and the broader attack 500 miles north, officials say.\n\nPresident Trump has dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia for urgent consultations.\n\nA spokesperson for the Houthi rebel group told Fox News that the government of Iran backs them and provides them with weapons and logistical support, but claimed that the relationship between the two has mostly been overblown.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'LOOKING LIKE' IRAN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SAUDI OIL ATTACKS\n\nIndeed, the sophistication of the assault, according to defense and geospatial experts, indicates a level far beyond the capability Houthis have demonstrated in previous infiltrations of Saudi airspace in terms of its precision, scope and distance.\n\nAbqaiq, one of the two major facilities that came under the air bombardment over the weekend, is one of the most vital oil production facilities in the Gulf as it carries out the intricate process of cleaving the hydrogen-sulfide gas from oil.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq is an over-centralized chokepoint. More than two-thirds of Saudi crude oil goes through that one facility on its way from the wells to export terminals. Abqaiq is where Aramco takes gas, dirt, sand, sulfur, and other impurities out of the stuff that flows up from wells,\u201d said Joseph Duggan, a geopolitical consultant who worked as a speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, in the State Department for President Ronald Reagan, and in Saudi Arabia for six years at Aramco headquarters.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq will have to be rebuilt, but the Saudis also should build redundant facilities dispersed around their country for the processing and blending that is now done primarily at Abqaiq,\u201d he added.\n\nDuggan also noted that Iran has undertaken cyberattacks against Aramco in the past, including malware that killed most Aramco desktop computers in 2012 and malware that attempted to spark an explosion at a petrochemical plant in 2017.\n\nSo what does an investigation of this scale involve as to who was behind the attacks?\n\nDANIEL TURNER: SAUDI ATTACKS HIT OIL PRICES BUT THIS IS WHAT AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE MEANS NOW\n\n\u201cRadar tracks. The area is heavily trafficked by aircraft so there will be radar records from commercial and military sources. Pieces of weapon debris, which give insight into weapon type, country of origin (manufacture), circuits that may contain programming, etc.,\u201d explained Lt. Col. Dakota Wood, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cAnalysis of attack vector \u2013 all targets hit from a specific direction, for example, accuracy and timing of hits \u2013 did all weapons hit their target with a precision and/or timed sequence that would imply sophistication in planning and execution of the attack.\u201d\n\nHe also said investigators would be looking for eyewitness accounts, as well as isolate any \"chatter\" or intercepts acquired by intelligence services that would reveal a \"controlling hand\" or communications between/among people that would reveal individuals, organizations and chain of command.\n\n\u201cSatellite imagery or video that might reveal the movement of units or pieces of equipment necessary to execute such an attack. And the effect of the munitions used \u2013 weapon platform, warhead, or explosive was able to penetrate \u2018x\u2019 or caused \u2018y\u2019 damage at a given level,\u201d Wood surmised. \u201cBy combining all of the bits and pieces of information, one is able to dismiss many possible actors and narrow the focus on just those able to acquire and employ the types of weapons used, reveals how close they had to have been to prosecute the attack and who was communicating with whom in the time leading up to, during, and after the attack.\u201d\n\nTehran has vehemently rejected any involvement, but such familiar denials are so far falling on deaf ears.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe want to find definitively who did this,\u201d President Trump said in a press briefing Monday afternoon. \u201cWe pretty much already know.\u201d\n\nFox News' Rich Edson contributed to this report.", "description": "It has been more than 3\u00a0days since Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure was crippled, and as the investigation continues, fingers are pointing towards Iran as not only the perpetrator, but also the launch territory.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
