That equipment failure is now being investigated.\n\nThe Tick Fire was reported shortly before 1.45pm on Thursday, and by Friday morning, flames already had consumed more than 4,000 acres and many homes within its path.\n\nIn Sonoma County, flames have scorched nearly 22,000 acres and destroyed at least 49 structures, including 21 homes.\n\nThis week's fire-season forecasts predicted a threatening combination of high winds and dry air in the state's tinder-like forestry.\n\nCal Fire, the state's fire agency, has reported roughly 163,000 acres have burned so far this year.\n\nThe fires follow devastating fires in 2017 and 2018 that killed dozens of people and ripped through thousands of buildings in northern California.\n\nThe Tubbs Fire in 2017 killed 22 people and destroyed 5,000 homes in Santa Rosa. The Camp Fire in Paradise killed 86 people and destroyed 20,000 buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\nWildfire visible from space forces evacuation in California\n\nThousands evacuate in California after fire threatens gas pipeline\n\nMan suspected of arson for Holy Fire that put 20,000 under evacuation\n\nLarge fire spreading near Coachella music festival", "description": "Wildfires in California have forced the evacuation of 40,000 residents north of Los Angeles and another 2,000 in the state's wine country.The so-called Tick Fire, which began Thursday afternoon just outside the city of Santa Clarita, had consumed about 4,000 acres and was only 5 per cent contained", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/deZpDCwmoCBjW7VKh6bVnA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/576f0cced1d653da9753d7444fe0973a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
