Elizabeth Warren ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden for the first time in this influential state.\n\nAn Iowa poll of likely Democratic caucus-goers sponsored by the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom released Saturday evening showed Ms. Warren of Massachusetts leading Mr. Biden, 22% to 20%. They were followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 11%, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 9%, Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 6%, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 3%. No other candidates recorded more than 2%.\n\nAt a closely watched event here earlier in the day featuring grilled meat and political speeches, 17 candidates tested their organizing efforts and sought to lock in support from this state\u2019s late-to-decide voters as the field showed signs it would winnow more before the leaves fall from the trees.\n\nMr. Buttigieg, while still struggling to elevate his standing in the polls, impressed attendees with a rousing speech that repeatedly brought activists to their feet.\n\n\u201cIn 135 days, you get to be the very first in the country to lead us away from the horror show, from the reality show,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said of President Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cPick up the remote and change the channel to something better.\u201d\n\nJeff Link, a longtime Democratic strategist in Iowa, said he was impressed by Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s presentation. \u201cIt was kind of the spark he needed,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Link also praised the organizational effort by Ms. Warren, who has also been gaining in national polls and had clipboard-wielding volunteers working the crowd to try to build her database of potential supporters.\n\nMr. Biden, who still leads in national polling, received a polite reception. The former vice president sold his health-care plan and how it would build on the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, as he sought to contrast himself with the Medicare for All proposal backed by two of his top challengers, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders.\n\nThe microphone was cut off after Mr. Biden talked longer than his allotted time, a fate experienced by several other candidates during the hours of afternoon speeches.\n\nSome of Mr. Biden\u2019s first remarks, while respectful to a revered Democrat in the state, also reminded the audience of his seniority. \u201cI started off here when it was the Tom Harkin steak fry,\u201d the 76-year-old candidate said, in a nod to the state\u2019s longtime former senator who started the tradition in 1972.\n\nThe steak fry has grown significantly over the years and changed in other ways. Besides steaks and chicken, there was also a vegan option.\n\nPresidential candidate Pete Buttigieg spoke during the Democratic Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday.

Organizers said the turnout was the largest since 2007, when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, then the junior senators from New York and Illinois, respectively, shared the stage with other 2008 presidential candidates.\n\nTo put the Saturday crowd in context, it represented roughly 5% of what might be expected for the total Iowa caucuses electorate.\n\nThe turnout record for the state\u2019s Democratic caucuses\u2014about 240,000\u2014was set on a bitterly cold night in January 2008, when Mr. Obama pulled out an upset victory over Mrs. Clinton and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina. Democratic strategists in the state say they are expecting that record will be broken, fueled by a deep desire to defeat Mr. Trump.\n\nSen. Booker\u2019s appearance was overshadowed by his campaign\u2019s announcement earlier in the day that the candidate plans to drop out of race if he doesn\u2019t raise $1.7 million in 10 days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in this as a vanity project or an exercise in ego,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t believe people should stay in this just to stay in it. You either have a trajectory to win or not, and right now if we don\u2019t raise $1.7 million we won\u2019t be able to make the investments necessary.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Buttigieg said he sees the race starting to consolidate, but that he doesn\u2019t expect much clarity until the final month before the Feb. 3 caucuses.\n\n\u201cMany people will make up their mind very late in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters now is to be able to demonstrate the strength to gather the numbers to win, and of course to have the resources to power through the grueling weeks and months ahead.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg, who has shown flashes of a sharper tone with his rivals in recent weeks, said he expects that trend to continue.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for people to really understand the distinctions between our campaigns,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that people understand the choice we\u2019re asking them to make because the different candidates really are presenting very different visions.\u201d\n\nIowa political veterans agree it is still too early to draw too many conclusions about the race.\n\n\u201cSome Iowans have committed and are working hard for their chosen candidates, but far more Iowans are still deciding,\u201d said Gordon Fischer, a former state Democratic Party chairman. \u201cThere are so many good candidates, and such high interest, this race will only be decided in the last two weeks or so before the caucuses.\u201d\n\nPam Zimmerman, a retired elementary-school teacher who attended the steak fry, said she is backing Mr. Buttiegieg because she has been the most impressed by him in the debates. \u201cHe\u2019s the youngest one, but he\u2019s acted the most mature among all the debaters,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, Ms. Zimmerman said she is willing to switch to Mr. Biden if it looks like Sens. Warren or Sanders might win because she is worried their policies are too liberal to defeat Mr. Trump. \u201cThe party will be shooting ourselves in the foot,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to John McCormick at mccormick.john@wsj.com", "description": "A traditional Iowa event served as a test laboratory for how to win the first round of Democratic presidential-nomination balloting, while a new poll showed Elizabeth Warren ahead of Joe Biden for the first time in the state.", "authors": ["John Mccormick", "Mccormick.John Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109600/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
