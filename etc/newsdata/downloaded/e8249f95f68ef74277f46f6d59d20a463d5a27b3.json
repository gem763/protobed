Various important events have been highlighted in red. For all countries the red shaded lines include World War I (1914-18) and World War II (1939-45). In the 3 European countries a line is drawn in 1848, the 'Year of Revolution'. In the USA, there is an additional shaded area representing the Civil War (1861-65) and the vertical red lines representing the Wall Street Crash (1929), the end of the Korean War (1953) and the fall of Saigon (1975). For Germany, the vertical red lines represent the end of Franco-Prussian War and reunification (1870), Hitler's ascendency to power (1934) and the reunification (1990).

The main source of language used for the analysis was the Google Books corpus, a collection of word frequency data for over eight million books which makes up more than six per cent of all books ever published. One theory as to why books and newspaper articles are such a good source of data is that editors prefer to publish pieces which match the mood of their readers. The method uses psychological valencenorms, or values of happiness that can be derived from text. This was used for thousands of words in different languages to compute the relative proportion of positive and negative language for four different nations including the UK, USA, Italy and Germany. Researchers also controlled for the evolution of language, to take into account the fact that some words change their meaning over time. Dr Chanuki Seresinhe said: 'It was really important to ensure that the changing meaning of words over time was taken into account. For example, the word 'gay' had a completely different meaning in the 1800s than it does today. We processed terabytes of word co-occurrence data from Google Books to understand how the meaning of words has changed over time, and we validate our findings using only words with the most stable historical meanings.' The study was led by researchers at the University of Warwick, University of Glasgow Adam Smith Business School and The Alan Turing Institute in London.\n\nInformation on each nation's happiness may help governments to make better decisions about policy priorities.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Professor Thomas Hills told the DailyMail.com: 'Those changes reflect numerous factors, including standard economics (money in the bank) and the freedom to dissent against foreign wars.\n\n'The recovery after the war also reflects a potential resiliency in our subjective wellbeing. This is something wellbeing researchers have understood for some time.\n\n'In many cases our subjective wellbeing is based on comparison with others, but also with recent events, which means it adapts to our circumstances.'\n\nHe added: 'What's remarkable is that national subjective well-being is incredibly resilient to wars. Even temporary economic booms and busts have little long-term effect.\n\n'We can see the American Civil War in our data, the revolutions of 48' across Europe, the roaring 20s and the Great Depression. But people quickly returned to their previous levels of subjective well-being after these events were over.\n\n'Our national happiness is like an adjustable spanner that we open and close to calibrate our experiences against our recent past, with little lasting memory for the triumphs and tragedies of our age.'\n\nThe US saw its unhappiest time during the Second World War, closely followed by the Vietnam war.\n\nProfessor Daniel Sgroi said aspirations 'seem to matter a lot'.\n\nThe study found people in the UK were happiest during the interwar years in the 1920s and after the end of the Second World War. The national levels of happiness plunged to its worst in the winter of discontent when union brought the nation to a stand-still.\n\nAs recorded by the researchers, the happiness level only reached a comparable level to the inter-war years in the 1990s and pre credit crunch boom years in the early 2000s.\n\nResults could indicate whether current government policies are more or less likely to increase their citizen's feelings or wellbeing.\n\nGovernments the world over are making increasing use of 'national happiness' data derived from surveys to help them consider the impact of policy on national wellbeing.\n\nBut data for most countries is only available from 2011 onwards and for a select few from the mid 1970s.\n\nThis makes it hard to establish long-run trends, or to say anything about the main historical causes of happiness.\n\nIn US, happiness reached its peak in the 1920s before Great Depression hit hard. The outbreak of WW2 sent it plunging further before recovery in the 50s and 60s.

Students march with anti-war placards on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley, California in 1969\n\nIn order to tackle this problem, the researchers took a key insight from psychology - that more often than not what people say or write reveals much about their underlying happiness level.\n\nThey then developed a method to apply it to online texts from millions of books and newspapers published over the past 200 years.\n\nThe new index was validated against existing survey-based measures and proven to be an accurate guide to the national mood.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.", "description": "Study, inset, used books and newspapers to track happiness between 1820 and 2009.
