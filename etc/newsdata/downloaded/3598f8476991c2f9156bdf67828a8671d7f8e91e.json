Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nContinuing to react on Twitter, the \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" host claimed lawmakers' push for the transcript of Trump's July call with Zelensky has brought up important legal and ethical questions.\n\nGIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN\n\n\"As for the demands for the transcript of the telephone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, there are serious constitutional issues, such as separation of powers, as well as serious practical issues such as a president being able to have a telephone call with another head of state without monitoring by extremely partisan members of Congress,\" Levin claimed.\n\nOne top Democrat, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. has demanded Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., urge the White House to release the call transcript, insisting that the Senate take this \"national security matter seriously.\"\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM\n\nIn its original story Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that, in the phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden -- a son of the former Delaware senator. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA person familiar with the situation told Fox News the individual did not have \u201cfirsthand knowledge\u201d of the conversation.\n\nThe source said that it is made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nFox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials are on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower is not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way.\n\nFox News' Jake Gibson, Alex Pappas, Adam Shaw and Judson Berger contributed to this report.", "description": "Mark Levin\u00a0fired off a series of tweets Monday after Fox News reported the whistleblower at the center of the controversy surrounding President Trump's phone call with Ukraine's leader did not have \"firsthand knowledge\" of the conversation.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Levin-Biden-Trump_FOX-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
