The musical traces her triumphant rise as a solo artist and her budding romance with Bach, but first it tears through the 16 years she spent with Ike. She met him when he was a swaggering St. Louis bandleader and she was 17-year-old Anna Mae. He gave her a break as a performer, but by the end, he had almost made her hate music. He changed her name, and then he trademarked it, and then he owned her. He stole her earnings. He threw hot coffee in her face. He broke her jaw. Through it all he made her sing, even if blood was running down her throat.\n\nIt is difficult to neatly fictionalize that kind of physical and psychological violence. When Disney mounted \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do With It,\u201d the 1993 biopic based on Turner\u2019s life, Laurence Fishburne would not agree to play Ike until his \u201ccardboard cutout\u201d villain character was deepened. The climax of the stage musical shows Tina Turner triumphantly hitting Ike back before running to freedom; in real life, she did hit him back, but then she rubbed his temples until he fell asleep; only then did she feel safe enough to sneak away.\n\nTo this day, Turner has never revealed the full extent of his abuse. \u201cI think I\u2019m ashamed,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel I told enough.\u201d\n\nTurner first documented the violence in her 1986 book \u201cI, Tina,\u201d and it was then that her public persona began to evolve from popular singer to living legend. Suddenly, \u201cYou\u2019re not just a star onstage with the hair and the legs,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had a life. You had a tough life.\u201d But once she had said it, she was forced to retell the story again and again. It felt like every time her friend Oprah interviewed her, she would ask, \u201cDo you remember the first time Ike hit you?\u201d When \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do With It\u201d came out, Turner didn\u2019t watch it. She didn\u2019t need to relive that nightmare.", "description": "A Swiss chateau. A Broadway musical all about her.
