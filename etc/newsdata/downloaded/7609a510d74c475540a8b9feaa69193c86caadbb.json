(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nMore than six years and $250 million after the Kennedy Center announced its ambitious expansion plans, the sprawling complex dubbed the Reach opens to the public this weekend. Its introduction to Washington is a free, 16-day festival of the arts, with a packed schedule of hundreds of events reflecting the Reach\u2019s wide-ranging cultural mission.\n\nThis Saturday alone, there are around 40 items on the agenda: master classes teaching Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s stage choreography, workshops about making art with recycled materials, screenings of short films, open rehearsals and performances by the National Symphony Orchestra, the Kronos Quartet and the Chuck Brown Band.\n\nOver the next two weeks, there\u2019s probably something you\u2019ll want to see at the Reach. Here\u2019s a guide to experiencing Washington\u2019s newest cultural hub.\n\n[Architecture review: Does the Kennedy Center have a vision for its elegant but awkward new annex?]\n\nRemind me \u2014 what\u2019s the Reach?\n\nThe sprawling complex, located just to the south of the performing arts center, provides additional rehearsal spaces for musicians and dancers, as well as facilities for which the Kennedy Center doesn\u2019t have room, such as hands-on classrooms for visiting students. It\u2019s designed to offer behind-the-scenes access to the public, who can watch rehearsals from a balcony overlooking a dance studio, for example. The studios and rehearsal rooms can also be used as intimate performance venues for smaller productions.\n\nIn addition to 10 indoor spaces, there\u2019s a public plaza, slated for outdoor concerts and movie screenings, a cafe and coffee bar, and a pedestrian bridge over Rock Creek Parkway that allows access to the Kennedy Center from the Rock Creek Trail along the Potomac River.\n\n\n\nThe Skylight Pavillion, as seen from the bridge at the Reach. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Skylight Pavillion at night. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nSo, how do I get into the festival?\n\nFree, timed-entry tickets are required to enter the facility during the opening festival. Three time slots are available each day: 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., 1:30 to 5 p.m. and 5:30 to 10 p.m. (A special 6 a.m. Daybreaker session on Thursday offers sunrise yoga and a 7 a.m. dance party, but the last tickets were snapped up earlier this week.)\n\nTickets were released to the public Aug. 7, and passes for the sessions with the biggest draws \u2014 a block party with hip-hop legends De La Soul on Sept. 14, a National Dance Day celebration hosted by choreographer Debbie Allen on Sept. 21, comedy showcases with Patton Oswalt and Rachel Dratch on Sept. 20 \u2014 \u201csold out\u201d weeks ago. In fact, there are no tickets left at all for this weekend, or any Saturdays or Sundays during the duration of the festival.\n\nBut I really, really want to see an artist that\u2019s \u201cSold Out.\u201d What are the chances I can still get in?\n\nFestival organizers know that not everyone who wanted to hear De La Soul or bring the kids to the singalong \u201cMuppet Movie\u201d (Sept. 15) got tickets, and they\u2019re aware that not everyone who claimed passes will actually show up. That\u2019s why ticketless visitors will be sent to the Kennedy Center\u2019s Hall of Nations, where entrance to the festival will be allowed on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n\u201cWe expect and want to accommodate those who will be in the standby line, and those who may not have been part of the initial rush\u201d of tickets, says Michelle A. Pendoley, the Kennedy Center\u2019s director of public relations. \u201cWhile we\u2019re confident that some in the standby line will be granted entry for most time slots, it\u2019s not possible to predict how many will get in for any given slot.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve got your heart set on seeing a certain performer, try to arrive as early as possible and be patient. The indoor, air-conditioned waiting area should make for a more pleasant experience.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Forum auditorium, with its distinctive crinkle concrete walls, will host film screenings and panel discussions during the opening festival. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nI got a pass for the time slot when my favorite artist is performing. How can I make sure I see them?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that your ticket only guarantees that you can enter the grounds of the Reach at the time you reserved. There are three entrances: two at the Kennedy Center, and one via the bridge from the Potomac. Organizers suggest you arrive up to 30 minutes before your ticketed time, to help get through lines and security. You\u2019ll be free to roam around at your leisure, taking in the new buildings \u2014 don\u2019t miss the crinkly acoustic walls in the studios, or the glass-walled Skylight Pavilion\u2019s views of the river \u2014 and whatever performances happen to be going on. A free app, called Reach Fest , includes a planner and live schedule.\n\nHowever, the Kennedy Center\u2019s website firmly states that tickets for a certain time slot \u201cdo not guarantee entry to any specific event. The reason is space: The Reach\u2019s overall capacity is 5,000, but that number is spread across 130,000 square feet indoors and outdoors. Take Saturday night as an example: The outdoor plaza where the Chuck Brown Band and Parliament-Funkadelic bassist Bootsy Collins are performing holds 2,000 people. The indoor Studio K, where 1990s hip-hop artists Speech and Arrested Development perform, has a capacity of 350, and the Justice Forum auditorium, where Charles Burnett\u2019s \u201cSelma, Lord, Selma\u201d is being screened, has 144 seats.\n\nOnce a room or venue hits capacity, that\u2019s it, which is probably going to encourage fans to arrive early and camp out well before the performance time for the artist they want to see. You\u2019ve been warned.\n\n\n\nA nighttime view of the Reach from the Roosevelt Bridge, with the original Kennedy Center building in the background. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nI have tickets for two time slots on the same day. Do I have to leave and get back in line at the end of the first one?\n\nNo. Each day of the festival has a different theme, such as jazz (Sunday) or classical and Broadway (Wednesday), with performances throughout the day. If you have tickets for multiple sessions, make sure you arrive on time for the first one of the day.\n\n\u201cAn intentional break in activities between each time slot\u201d serves as a cue that the session is over, Pendoley explains, but they\u2019re not going to make everyone exit. If you have tickets for the next one, you\u2019re welcome to hang out until the next round of activities begins.\n\n\n\nOne of the multiuse rehearsal studios. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nI don\u2019t want to wait in long lines, even for De La Soul, but I want to see what the fuss is about. Can I just drop in on my lunch break next week?\n\nThat\u2019s probably the best way to get a feel for the Reach: As of press time, none of the festival\u2019s weekday 10 a.m. or 1:30 p.m. time slots were sold out, which means you should be able to show up and walk in.\n\nWhile many of the daytime programs are targeted at families, there are plenty of other things to see and hear, such as the National Symphony Orchestra\u2019s rehearsing with Broadway stars for a tribute to composer Alan Menken (Wednesday at 1 p.m.); a conversation with best actress nominee Yalitza Aparicio of \u201cRoma\u201d (Tuesday at 11 a.m.); or musicians from the Opera House Orchestra performing \u201ca concert in the chill-out lounge space\u201d of the Skylight Pavilion (Monday at noon). And there will be hands-on activities and a virtual reality lounge, among other things, open daily.\n\n\n\nA view of the River Pavilion, which has a coffee shop and small restaurant. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nWill there be anything special to eat and drink, or are we stuck with the Kennedy Center cafeteria?\n\nThere are two new options at the Reach: a coffee bar in the main Welcome Pavilion, and the River Cafe, a coffee shop and small restaurant, in the River Pavilion \u2014 the space farthest from the existing Kennedy Center.\n\nFood at the festival is being \u201ccurated\u201d by two locals: chef Erik Bruner-Yang of Maketto and Brothers and Sisters, and Eric Hilton, the owner of Marvin and the Brixton, and a co-founder of the electronic group Thievery Corporation, which performs at the festival Sept. 13. The schedule features meet-and-greets with D.C. chefs from all eight wards, whose food will be featured during these spotlights. More menu options at the River Cafe will come from Bruner-Yang\u2019s existing concepts. There also will be food trucks throughout the festival.\n\nBeyond the festival, Bruner-Yang and Hilton will begin curating pop-ups at the River Cafe sometime in 2020, though all the details aren\u2019t clear yet.\n\nIf performances are free, what about parking?\n\nThe Kennedy Center\u2019s usual parking rates \u2014 $20 in advance, $23 at the door \u2014 will apply throughout the festival. The most economical way to get there is the usual free shuttle bus, which runs daily, every 15 minutes from outside the Foggy Bottom Metro station, but expect crowding and lines during popular events. At peak times, such as weekends, it might be faster to walk the half-mile from the Metro station.\n\n\n\nThe lobby of the Welcome Pavilion. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat kind of events and activities will be at the Reach once the festival\u2019s over?\n\nOne of the goals for the Reach is to provide visitors with a behind-the-scenes views of rehearsals and the creative process, by making the studios open to the public. \u201cThere is no backstage space,\u201d Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter told The Post in June. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a front of house and back of house.\u201d Daily guided tours will be offered after the festival ends.\n\nThe Kennedy Center hasn't released a Reach-specific calendar yet, though the Moonshot studio, which offers interactive and hands-on activities, will begin offering Saturday morning drop-in events for families on Sept. 28.\n\nThe Reach\u2019s first visual arts exhibition is \u201cPortraits of Courage,\u201d a collection of 66 paintings of veterans by former president George W. Bush, which will be on display from Oct. 7 to Nov. 15. (Free timed tickets are required.) Other highlighted happenings include an Oct. 1 book signing and discussion with Ben Folds, a National Symphony Orchestra artistic adviser, and \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Dance,\u201d an Oct. 5 discussion about legendary modern dance choreographer Merce Cunningham\u2019s artistic process as part of the Kennedy Center\u2019s \u201cMerce Cunningham at 100\u201d program.", "description": "D.C.\u2019s newest cultural hub is hosting hundreds of events across multiple genres.", "authors": ["Fritz Hahn", "Reporter Covering Bars", "Drinks", "Nightlife For The Washington Post'S Weekend Section", "Fritz Hahn Has Covered Bars", "Nightlife For The Washington Post'S Weekend Section Since", "But He Also Writes About A Variety Of Local Entertainment Topics."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-reE9E3dMPWq5Ll-RFDdJMlRzg4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5QI2BHGM3II6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
