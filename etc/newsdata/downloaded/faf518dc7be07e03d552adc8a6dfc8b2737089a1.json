It\u2019s also hard to tell exactly which iPhone this apparent Smart Case is designed for \u2014 but Apple released battery cases for all three 2018 iPhones, so it would make sense that they\u2019ll come to all three 2019 iPhones.", "description": "Apple might be releasing new Smart Battery Cases for its latest iPhones, as 9to5Mac found a photo in the code for iOS 13.2 of what looks to be an unreleased Smart Battery Case for an iPhone with a square camera bump.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c2ZKnJcQErr7OPEK3T9u1m4IVE0=/0x75:3840x2085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19325529/sbc_iphone11.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
