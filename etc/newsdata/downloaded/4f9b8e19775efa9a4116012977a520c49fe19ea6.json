Bumblebee!\u2019: A 4-year-old got an epic surprise, and the strangers who gave it to him got something, too", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nShannon Rogish drove all the way from Staunton, Va., to participate in a birthday surprise for 4-year-old Whitaker Weinburger. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nTo get to Northern Virginia in time to surprise a boy he had never met, Shannon Rogish couldn\u2019t just roll out of bed and drive a few miles.\n\nHe had to plan.\n\nHe had to take the day off, wake up to a still-black sky and drive for hours.\n\nThe map app told him it would take about three hours to get there from his home in Staunton, Va. So on Tuesday, he went to bed at 7 p.m., and on Wednesday, he woke up by 2 a.m. and was on the road by 3.\n\n\u201cI was just praying the whole time as I was driving that I wouldn\u2019t hit anything and that traffic wouldn\u2019t be that bad,\u201d he said while sitting in his car, a Mountain Dew in the center console, just in case he needed the caffeine. \u201cAnd I got lucky with all that.\u201d\n\nRogish\u2019s 2015 Camaro was among the 100-plus yellow vehicles that lined several blocks of an Alexandria neighborhood on Wednesday morning, providing a bright moment on an otherwise solemn day. Later, across the region and country, there would be remembrances for those who were lost on Sept. 11, 2001. But for a few hours, at this speck on the map, strangers came together to celebrate a life.\n\nThey came to surprise a boy who turned 4 that day and was healthy for the first time ever on his birthday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing it because I want to see the kid smile,\u201d said Rogish, a volunteer firefighter and an engineer at a manufacturing plant. \u201cI can only imagine the hell he\u2019s gone through.\u201d\n\nThat hell began just weeks after Whitaker Weinburger\u2019s first birthday. A blood test led to a concerning call from his pediatrician and soon, his mother, Erin Weinburger, was sitting in the hospital, listening to a doctor tell her that her 13-month-old had Stage 4 neuroblastoma.\n\nIn a recent column, I told you what the family went through in the years that followed that cancer diagnosis. I also shared with you how after a double stem-cell transplant, only one potentially concerning spot now remains on Whitaker\u2019s scans and he is healthy enough to attend preschool.\n\nWhen his mother and his father, Seth Weinburger, first started talking about how to make his walk to school special on his birthday, their idea focused on a single yellow car. Whitaker often begs them to drive by one in their neighborhood because it reminds him of Bumblebee, a character from the Transformer cartoon and movie series. They considered asking their neighbor to park in front of their house on Whitaker\u2019s birthday.\n\nThen, Erin Weinburger took that idea further. She posted a call for yellow cars on a private Facebook page. That request then made its way onto other pages, into the media and onto the calendars of more yellow-vehicle owners than she ever expected.\n\nWhen she thought 50 drivers might show up, she told me, \u201cI hope that all those people that come connect with each other, too, because they\u2019re seeing something great. They\u2019re seeing something great in each other.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, more than 100 came. I wish I could tell you exactly how many, but it was impossible to count them all. There were bulldozers and buses, Camaros and Corvettes. There were yellow cabs with \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d balloons dangling outside their windows.\n\n\n\nDrivers of more than 100 yellow vehicles show up to surprise Whitaker on his birthday.

(Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\nThere was even a child-size yellow Tesla with an Autobot symbol on its hood and \u201cWhitaker\u201d on its license plate.\n\nPratik Sharma, of Ashburn, said his friend bought it for Whitaker as a gift. Sharma told me this while wearing a head-to-toe Bumblebee costume.\n\nAre you a Bumblebee fan? I asked.\n\n\u201cI am today,\u201d he said, \u201cfor Whitaker.\u201d\n\nDoug Hoyles also came with gifts for the child. He placed three toy cars still in their boxes on a wagon and attached it to a remote-control car.\n\nHoyles, who lives in Ashburn, loves cars and loves yellow, so when Erin Weinburger\u2019s Facebook post started spreading, he heard about it from \u201cmaybe 70 or 80 people.\u201d\n\nThree of the cars that lined the roads near the family\u2019s house belonged to him. He drove his Camaro, his wife drove his Charger and friend Pete Lapp drove his Ram.\n\nLapp, who is an FBI agent, described the celebratory atmosphere as a welcome contrast to other memories from Sept. 11. Eighteen years earlier, he spent 9/11 interviewing a woman who, during a hotel stay, saw one of the planes crash.\n\n\u201cThis is a good memory for all of us,\u201d Lapp said.\n\nWhen Whitaker finally walked out his front door with his mom, dad and sister, he saw neighbors waving signs, people in yellow clothes standing by yellow cars and cameras, so many cameras, pointed at him. He ducked for a moment behind his sister, Lakeland, and then held her hand and walked to the front of his yard.\n\n\n\nWhitaker, sister Lakeland and mom Erin walk out of their home to find neighbors holding signs, their street filled with yellow cars and people in costumes. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s all sing!\u201d someone yelled, and the crowd broke into \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\n\nSoon, Whitaker was smiling and taking in the surreal scene while walking to school with an entourage of familiar and strange faces.\n\n\u201cBumblebee!\u201d he squealed, followed by \u201cBumblebee! Bumblebee!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he and his parents said repeatedly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming. It\u2019s amazing,\u201d his grandfather Terry Weinburger said as we walked together at one point. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just a demonstration of what I would call the value of community, of people caring.\u201d\n\nThe Alexandria Sheriff\u2019s Office took on the tough task of directing drivers into parking spots along the route, and when the vehicles were finally in place, they stretched for more than mile, all the way to Charles Barrett Elementary School. When Whitaker finally arrived, he found the students waiting outside to see him and teacher Melissa Poggio directing traffic while dressed as Bumblebee.\n\n\n\nErin Weinburger carries Whitaker during the walk to school.

(Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe crowd sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d once more, and then, it was time for the group celebration to end. Whitaker had to get to class.\n\nThe drivers also had to get going. Some had long stretches of road ahead of them.\n\nRogish, who has participated in charitable drives through Rally North America, planned to drive straight home. He said the three hours he spent getting to Alexandria and the three hours he would spend leaving it were \u201cmost certainly\u201d worth it.\n\nHe moved his car twice while the family walked so that he could catch glimpses of Whitaker.\n\n\u201cHe had a big ol\u2019 smile on his face both times he passed me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kid has a lot of energy, and that was good to see.\u201d", "description": "More than 100 yellow vehicles filled a Northern Virginia neighborhood on Wednesday, providing a bright moment on an otherwise solemn day.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities.", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xjfltXgDhiP4oATy2EKdKQUkE30=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MC6W2KWUUMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
