Some describe it as a bad omen for Israel.\n\nThat concern, while legitimate, ignores Trump\u2019s long-term strategy in the region and the legitimate interest Turkey has in removing an armed force from its border \u2014 an interest Israel shares.\n\nIsrael has invaded southern Lebanon in two previous wars to disarm terrorist militias that had used the territory to launch terror attacks against its civilians.\n\nIn 1982, Israel invaded to remove Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrillas; in 2006, Israel fought back against Iranian-backed Hezbollah.\n\nIt is likely that Israel will have to invade Lebanon again in a future war to disarm Hezbollah, which abuses the local civilian population as human shields.\n\nYes, there are important differences between the two cases. The threat from Hezbollah to Israel is more potent than the threat from Kurdish forces to Turkey. Moreover, Israel is meticulous about human rights; Turkey is not. The Turkish government is moving toward autocracy and extremism; Israeli democracy is vibrant and healthy.\n\nYet the same arguments being deployed against Turkey will be used against Israel. That should give pro-Israel critics pause.\n\nInterestingly, few of Trump\u2019s critics, at home or abroad, have appealed to the United Nations to intervene. That is a precedent that serves Israel\u2019s interests, since the UN invariably weighs in agains Israel when it has to go to war.\n\nSome commentators have accused Trump of abandoning the Kurds, an ally in the fight against the so-called Islamic State (ISIS). Yet Turkey is also an ally \u2014 one to which the U.S. is bound by the NATO treaty. (Indeed, many of the same critics of Trump\u2019s decision today were accusing him of abandoning NATO yesterday).\n\nThe U.S has no formal agreement with the Kurds, who are distributed across several states and deeply divided by faction and nationality.\n\nCritics contend, correctly, that Turkey has becoming less reliable as an ally in recent decades. But it is not so easy to unravel the alliance. Breaking ranks with Turkey would damage NATO in the face of advancing threats from Russia and China. Moreover, the U.S. has strategic forces in Turkey, including (likely) nuclear weapons. Would it be worth risking those forces, and those weapons, over the Kurds? Perhaps, but few critics have bothered to consider the cost.\n\nIn any case, the U.S. has not abandoned the Kurds. On Tuesday, Russia and Syria announced joint patrols of the border, and Kurdish forces agreed to withdraw 30km outside the region. General Mazloum Abdi, the pre-eminennt leader of the Kurdish forces in the area, thanked Trump for stopping the Turkish advance \u2014 a feat the administration proudly accomplished through the use of economic sanctions without, as Trump noted, \u201cspilling American blood.\u201d\n\nSome have argued that Trump has strengthened Iran by pulling out of Syria. If so, Iran has failed to notice. In fact, Iran has protested against Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria, and Turkey\u2019s president criticized Iran before meeting Russia this week.\n\nIf Trump were not building up regional U.S. forces to deter Iran, after pulling out of the nuclear deal and increasing sanctions on Iran\u2019s economy, the critics might have a point. But the U.S. position on Iran remains strong.\n\nIn fact, Trump has arguably made a military threat to Iran more credible. By withdrawing U.S. forces from a fight in which American interests are conflicted at best, Trump is preserving political capital to support a potential war effort where U.S. interests are clear.\n\nWhile U.S. troops are authorized to be in Syria to fight terror under the post-9/11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, Congress has never authorized an American military mission to keep the peace between Turkey and the Kurdish militias. A future war against Iran \u2014 should it be necessary \u2014 would be harder to defend amidst \u201cmission creep\u201d in Syria.\n\nThose who argue that withdrawing from Syria means threatening the alliance with Israel are ignoring Trump\u2019s outstanding record as the most pro-Israel president in U.S. history, as well as the fact that the alliance with Israel is a permanent one.\n\nIf anything, Israel\u2019s example shows the weaknesses in the Kurdish cause. When the British planned to withdraw from Palestine in 1947-48, the Zionists prepared for statehood \u2014 politically, diplomatically, and militarily.\n\nTrump began talking about withdrawing from Syria last year. In the year since, Kurdish leaders appear to have done little to prepare for the day after, or even appealed for peace talks.\n\nMoreover, when Iraqi Kurds voted for independence in a referendum in 2017, few of those who criticize Trump\u2019s policy in Syria today rushed to the Kurds\u2019 defense as the Iraqi military rushed into Kurdish-held territory to quash any such notion.\n\nIsrael has been America\u2019s best ally because it has taken responsibility for its own destiny. Whatever the merits of the Kurdish cause, it has lacked leadership, organization, unity, and support.\n\nTherefore, while there are good reasons to be concerned about the fate of Kurdish civilians, much of the criticism of Trump\u2019s decision is overblown. The situation is complicated and there are no easy solutions.\n\nCriticism is legitimate, but pro-Israel critics in particular ought to be far more careful about their condemnations.\n\nJoel B.
