The opportunity is there but every time we have looked, we haven\u2019t been able to meet our economic and our strategic hurdles in Australia,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Magro\u2019s comments suggested Nutrien had cast an eye over Incitec Pivot\u2019s fertiliser production assets, which include heavy manufacturing at Gibson Island and the Duchess ammonia phosphate mine in western Queensland as well as east coast blending facilities.\n\n\u201cGiven the timelines that I understand that acquisition is under, it is not something we are actively looking at right now,\u201d he said.\n\nIncitec chief executive Jeanne Johns has flagged a possible divestment of the Australian fertiliser business that would allow the company to focus on its explosives division.\n\nTempted by opportunity\n\nMr Magro said Nutrien would never say never to building or buying production assets in Australia and would be highly tempted by an opportunity in nitrogen if it could find low-cost gas.\n\n\"In nitrogen we need low-cost gas. It is 70-75 per cent of the cost structure,\" he said.\n\n\"Relatively speaking gas in Australia is expensive and I think that is why you don't have a strong nitrogen business that is export based.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"But you have a very strong LNG business and I think certain trade-offs have been made and by the looks of it for the right reasons. Whereas in Canada decisions were made decades ago to have a petrochemical and fertiliser production business based on low-cost gas.\"\n\nNutrien is set to scrap the Landmark and Ruralco brand names as it focuses on an integration of the two businesses which will leave ASX-listed Elders a long way back as the second biggest player in farm services in Australia.", "description": "Canadian fertiliser giant questions the wisdom of $US5b Jansen project and reveals only high gas prices have stopped it building or buying production assets in Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.592%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_31%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/54eef01a87bd8580fff435af53ce368a9d8a9ba9", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
