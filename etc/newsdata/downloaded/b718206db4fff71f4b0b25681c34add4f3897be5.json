Hart's friend, Jared Black, was behind the wheel at the time of the accident.\n\nLaw enforcement sources tell TMZ Black gunned the engine and lost control of Hart's 1970 Plymouth Barracuda. The sudden acceleration and loss of control apparently caused the car to go into a spin as it crashed through fencing off Mulholland Highway and into an embankment. According to the report, which was obtained by TMZ, it's believed no one in the car \u2014 Black, Hart or Black's fianc\u00e9e Rebecca Broxterman \u2014 was wearing a seatbelt. The Barracuda reportedly did not have safety harnesses. The car did not have any mechanical issues, so it was driver error.\n\nKevin Hart has \"nothing but love\" for friend after California Highway Patrol reportedly finds Jared Black to blame for car crash.

Black was airlifted to a hospital with significant back injuries and Broxterman only suffered minor injuries. Hart was released from the hospital last month and has been recovering at home.\n\nHart, who has been going through grueling physical rehabilitation for his back, reportedly returned to work this week. According to TMZ, Hart participated in promotional shoots for his upcoming film, \u201cJumanji: The Next Level.\u201d The website said that while Hart is \"nowhere near 100 percent yet,\" he \"is committed to fulfilling his commitments as best as he can.\" TMZ added, \"Kevin has not been in full costume for these shoots and he's not walking much for them either \u2014 sitting through most of the day \u2014 even though he can walk on his own these days.\"\n\nThe \u201cJumanji\u201d sequel hits theaters in December. It remains to be seen how involved Hart will be in the promotional tour.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
