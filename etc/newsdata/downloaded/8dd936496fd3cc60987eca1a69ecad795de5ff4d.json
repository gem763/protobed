He\u2019s a thrilling live performer, having trainer as a dancer from the age of 10 until he was 19, which adds a physical component to his searing tracks about race, mental health, religion and love.\n\nSquid \u2013 Friday 1 November, 8pm, Petite Halle\u200b\n\nBrighton-formed troublemakers Squid are a band of upstarts releasing one eccentric, squawking post-punk number after the next. The single \u201cHouseplants\u201d \u2013 their best to date \u2013 is a giddy, swirling vortex into which the band have thrown their personal band of youthful mania, along with a bouncy little guitar riff.\n\noklou \u2013 Saturday 2 November, 9.15pm, Studio\n\nA French artist currently based in London, oklou (born MaryLou Mayniel) makes R&B-influenced productions that sample contemporary and nostalgic pop music, from Carly Rae Jepsen to Avril Lavigne. In doing so, she captures universal experiences such as loneliness, heard on tracks such as \u201cThey Can\u2019t Hear Me\u201d and \u201cFriendless\u201d from her 2018 EP The Rite of May.\n\nYussuf Dayes \u2013 Thursday 31 October, 9pm, Petite Halle\u200b\n\nLondon-based drummer Yussef Dayes, of the celebrated funk-jazz duo Yussef Kamal, made his live solo debut last year following the release of his single \u201cLove is the Message\u201d. Anyone seeking a moment of introspection in between the livelier sets could hardly do better than Dayes, whose nimble arrangements of electric guitar and percussion are both poignant and reflective.\n\nJessica Pratt \u2013 Saturday 2 November, 7pm, Studio stage\n\nAmerican artist Jessica Pratt possesses a voice that belongs to another time altogether, such is its warm and weathered quality. On her 2019 album Quiet Signs, she crafts dreamy landscapes that open on simple motifs and gradually bloom into bolder arrangements of woodwind, piano and strings.\n\nPitchfork Paris Festival takes place 31 October \u2013 2 November", "description": "Pitchfork Paris is taking place this Thursday (31 October) at La Grande Halle de la Villette in the 19th arrondissement (the festival\u2019s home since 2011).
