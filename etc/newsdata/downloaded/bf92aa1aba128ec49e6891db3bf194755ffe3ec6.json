I wish I knew someone older than me \u2014 a parent, a brother, an awesome neighbour \u2014 who had laptops and smartphones and gadgets galore that they could pass my way when they were sick of using them.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t, but Lifehacker reader Kyle certainly does. And while free stuff is always fun and appreciated, there\u2019s one quirk with his latest acquisition that he needs help solving. He writes:\n\n\u201cI was given old mac (the cheese grater one) and I don\u2019t have a login. What can I do to use the machine?\u201d\n\nFor the purposes of this answer \u2014 at least, the first part of it \u2014 I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019re asking how to log into a machine when you don\u2019t have the user name and password. This question speaks to a larger point, though: How do I access a machine that someone else has locked down?\n\nThankfully, we don\u2019t need to worry about any kind of crazy recovery tools or password-cracking advice for this one, since your ultimate goal is not to get into an account that isn\u2019t yours, but to use a system on which that account was previously created. In other words, we can just reset your cheese grater to its factory defaults and set it up as if it were a brand-new system, eliminating that login issue in the process.\n\nThe easy way to do this \u2014 assuming your Mac\u2019s previous owner hasn\u2019t set up a firmware password, which makes things a lot trickier \u2014 is to simply boot into your Mac\u2019s recovery mode when you start it up. Power on your computer and immediately start holding Command+R. Continue doing this until you see something happen on your screen (typically an Apple logo or a spinning globe), then you can release the keys.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see the macOS \u201cutilities window\u201d when recovery boots, and instead see something like \u201cmacOS Recovery\u201d with a prompt asking you to enter a user\u2019s password, click on Recovery Assistant and select Erase Mac. Click on the blue \u201cErase Mac\u201d hyperlink and let \u2018er rip \u2014 this will wipe your system and allow you to set up a new version of macOS from scratch (with whatever user name and password you want).\n\nOtherwise, if you make it into the primary macOS \u201cutilities window,\u201d launch Disk Utility. Select the drive that has macOS installed on it, and choose Erase. When done, quit out of Disk Utility and begin the process of reinstalling macOS via the handy link in the main \u201cmacOS Utilities\u201d screen.\n\nI\u2019m hoping the person who gave you your new Mac disabled iCloud (and the \u201cFind My...\u201d feature) before coughing it up. Otherwise, you should be able to reset your Mac\u2019s NVRAM/PRAM, which deletes the \u201cFind My\u201d association. You can then sign into your iCloud account, and you should be able to set up your Mac as if it was always and forever yours. (You might also be able to just log into iCloud as normal, without resetting your NVRAM/PRAM, to associate the erased Mac with your own iCloud account. I\u2019d try both steps.)\n\nThis should get you up and running with your new Mac.", "description": "We\u2019re tackling a  fun issue with geeky hand-me-downs in this week\u2019s Tech 911.
