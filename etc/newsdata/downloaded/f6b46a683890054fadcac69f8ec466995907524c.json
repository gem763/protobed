The result has been a volatile year for top industrial firms that do business in Asia.\n\nPerhaps nothing illustrates this give-and-take better than the iShares U.S. Industrials ETF IYJ, -0.28%, which has boomeranged from about $160 in September 2018 to a low of under $120 in early 2019 and then back to crest the $160 mark once more and set a new all-time high.\n\nThat dramatic bounce shows that timing is everything. If you\u2019ve been holding the iShares U.S. Industrials ETF IYJ, -0.28% for the past 12 month, then you may have very little to show for it. Then again, a bargain purchase during one of the low periods could have handed you gains of more than 30% in short order. In the past three months, the industrial sector has been the No. 3 performer among 11 tracked by S&P. Over 12 months, industrials rank No. 8, showing recent strong performance.\n\nIt\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess what the latest Trump tweet will do to companies that rely on Chinese trade, so short-term volatility is surely to be expected for some time. However, investors have proven that they will keep coming back to select stocks after valuations drop to bargain levels they simply can\u2019t pass up. And, now, the industrial sector seems to have the wind at its back.\n\nSo which stocks are attractive? Here are five:\n\nCorning\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Corning GLW, -1.17% because it has been in the news after a 6% decline on Tuesday owing to trouble at its display and fiber-optic arms. That\u2019s disappointing, particularly because the two divisions contribute about half of the company\u2019s revenue. But the glass-half-full argument for this specialty glassmaker is that the rest of its revenue comes from other units that hold promise \u2014 including specialty materials for filter materials, smartphone screens and life-science applications.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s important to keep the magnitude of the forecast shift in mind. The company said it would swing from a previously projected low single-digit increase to a low single-digit decline. Any decline is bad news, of course, but it seems quite an extreme reaction for a swing that may simply turn out to be from an expected 2% up to 2% down. Plenty of firms on Wall Street post those kinds of numbers with zero warning!\n\nAnd by the way, while investors this week are caught up in the recent leg down, it\u2019s worth noting the price history of Corning stock: It fell below $29 in December and again in May before its recent trouble in August, and each time quickly snapped back to $33 or higher. That\u2019s a hint that investors have faith in a floor for Corning\u2019s stock. With the shares comfortably above their 52-week low of $26.8 even after recent volatility, there\u2019s a good chance Corning will find a floor here.\n\nGeneral Electric\n\nAnother troubled industrial player that many investors may not trust is General Electric GE, +0.21%. However, despite massive challenges over the past decade or so, some investors seem to think that the worst is over for GE as it right-sizes itself and gets focused on a turnaround.\n\nThe most obvious proof of that turnaround: GE\u2019s stock bottomed at around $6.50 in December and then rallied more than 70% to crest $11 a share this year. Shares have consolidated lately, but remain comfortably above support levels of around $9. And now that the industrial icon has closed its sale of Baker Hughes BHGE, -0.64%, there are hints that the plan to reduce debt and focus on core businesses is finally coming together.\n\nIn fact, a William Blair analyst said in a note earlier this year that its \u201cresurrection\u201d could accelerate from here, including an IPO of GE\u2019s health-care unit that would certainly pique Wall Street\u2019s interest. And with a persistently low interest rate environment, GE can expect easy access to capital to facilitate its turnaround and recovery.\n\nCaterpillar\n\nCaterpillar CAT, -0.83% fell more than 35% from its 2018 peak to recent lows in early 2019, in large part because of weakness in its construction and upstream oil and gas arms. However, those who are optimistic about industrials can find a lot to like about Caterpillar.\n\nCount among those bulls a Bank of America analyst who plotted a price target of $160 for Caterpillar several months ago, thanks in large part to a favorable valuation versus peers and the prospects of lower interest rates. That valuation remains attractive at a forward P/E of less than 11, compared with about 18 for the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13%, and the current environment of rock-bottom rates means Caterpillar can borrow incredibly cheaply right now.\n\nGiven recent uncertainty about global oil supplies, some analysts expect a nice tailwind for Caterpillar\u2019s related businesses in the second half of 2019. And that\u2019s on top of record second-quarter earnings.\n\nSure, executives acknowledged tariffs could lead to an increase in costs. However, management is confident they can raise prices to offset the higher expenses and sustain profitability. Throw in a nice 3.1% dividend that is only about a third of earnings and ripe for future increases and it\u2019s easy to see the case for Caterpillar.\n\nBoeing\n\nBoeing BA, +0.58% is another company that has been benefiting from the recent dust-up in the Middle East, in large part because of its defense business. And perhaps most importantly, the bids for Boeing\u2019s stock come at a crucial time when sentiment is starting to shift for this industrial giant.\n\nOver the past year or so, headlines have been largely unfavorable for Boeing. From the grounding of the 737 Max to concerns over the Defense Department\u2019s refusal to take delivery of KC-46 tankers, investors have had plenty of red flags to make them head for the hills \u2014 including news this summer that increased 737 costs will eat into future margins.\n\nClearly, investors feel like they know everything they need to about the state of Boeing\u2019s recent production woes, as Boeing\u2019s stock has pushed to its highest level since April. Investors don\u2019t need a long memory to see why, either, as this defense giant rallied strongly across all of 2017 on the prospect of stronger defense spending under the Trump administration. Simply getting back to their recent highs of around $440 a share would deliver a nice 15% to 20% gain for investors who buy now.\n\nAccenture\n\nYou may not classify Accenture ACN, -0.42% as an industrial stock, but it is an important consultant to a host of industrial players, including automotive, freight, electrical-equipment and consumer-durable-goods companies. And the bottom line is that in an era of persistent profitability pressures for industrial firms, Accenture is a crucial partner for many industrial companies of all sizes. As a result, it\u2019s an important component in the aforementioned iShares U.S. Industrials ETF, making up more than 3% of the fund\u2019s holdings.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Accenture doesn\u2019t have a tech angle. Its recent acquisition of an up-and-coming artificial intelligence and big data firm in Spain proves that. But Accenture is all about using technology and data to serve all sectors \u2014 including key industrial players.\n\nThe fact that Accenture\u2019s approach has been connecting with clients has been evident all year, starting with a blowout report in March that shows 8% growth in North America and 9% in Europe and then a strong report in June that featured higher full-year guidance.\n\nThere was a bit of uncertainty to start the year after Accenture\u2019s CEO stepped down for health reasons, but the appointment of insider Julie Sweet in July hinted that the company wouldn\u2019t miss a beat. A steady upward climb for shares this year backs that notion, with Accenture racking up nearly 40% gains since Jan. 1.\n\nJeff Reeves is a MarketWatch columnist.", "description": "Caterpillar and General Electric are still on sale as industrials approach a record high.", "authors": ["Jeff Reeves"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR519_CAT_20_ZG_20190918094934.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
