But when he recently stumbled onto Nine Inch Nails\u2019 1989 song \u201cHead Like a Hole,\u201d he was hooked.\n\n\u201cThis led me down a three-day, binge-listening rabbit hole of Nine Inch Nails and Spotify\u2019s suggestions on similar music,\u201d said the 29-year-old engineer for a medical-device company, who found the song thanks to Miley Cyrus\u2019s cover on the Netflix series \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d\n\nOlder music is the biggest growth area in music streaming, according to Nielsen. Labels are looking to cash in on \u201ccatalog\u201d tunes\u2014officially, songs released more than 18 months ago\u2014both from veteran artists and more recent acts whose earlier hits still have traction, while the streaming services are tapping nostalgia to broaden their subscriber bases to include people more interested in Led Zeppelin than in Billie Eilish.\n\nOver the past 10 months, major services including Spotify Technology SA, Alphabet Inc. \u2019s YouTube and Amazon have created \u201chead of catalog\u201d executive roles, charged with promoting older music in ways that engage listeners of all ages. Apple Music, part of Apple Inc., has had such a position for several years, as has Sirius XM Holdings Inc. \u2019s Pandora, which has been expanding its catalog team.\n\nMusic companies say they are now able to pitch older music for some of Spotify\u2019s popular mood and genre playlists. The \u201cSummer Road Trip\u201d list, for instance, recently included songs from 1970s-born bands the Cure and the Doobie Brothers alongside more recent hits from Lil Nas X and Meduza. \u201cThe Cookout\u201d list mingles recent hits by Childish Gambino and Drake with oldies from Bill Withers and Kool & the Gang.\n\nStreaming is more tilted toward catalog than sales have ever been, according to Nielsen Music analyst David Bakula. Retailers\u2014both online and physical\u2014have tended to display new material front and center, and sales of tracks and albums historically have been around half catalog and half new music.\n\nFrom the invention of the phonograph in 1877 to the boom in streaming services today, the music industry has had to constantly adapt to emerging technology.

It is just as easy for subscribers to turn to familiar favorites as current hits, and the services employ automatically generated recommendations that don\u2019t necessarily emphasize new releases.\n\n\u201cIn a buying world, that recommendation doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Mr. Bakula said. \u201cThe lift of these songs is living longer than it would have in a sales world.\u201d And artists\u2019 home pages on Spotify and Apple Music often list their most popular songs, playlists and albums more prominently than their newest work, he said.\n\nLabels and music publishers, eager to introduce older songs to younger audiences, are increasingly seeking to license catalog music to ads, television shows and films. And a proliferation of music-oriented biopics and documentaries is driving more people\u2014old fans and new\u2014to stream the music of the featured artists like Queen and Elton John.\n\nRobert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin.

Among those participating in the promotion were other musicians, such as Jack White, with a 10-song \u201cLed Zeppelin x Jack White\u201d list.\n\n\u201cThe songs those artists identified as their favorites then became the trending growth tracks in Led Zeppelin\u2019s catalog,\u201d said Tim Fraser-Harding, head of catalog at Warner Music Group.\n\nFor the 25th anniversary of the Beastie Boys\u2019 \u201cIll Communication,\u201d Amazon Music worked with the group to create a documentary about the creative process in the years leading up to the landmark album.\n\n\u201cIt gave us a reason to reach out to customers and reintroduce them to this music,\u201d said Ryan Redington, director of Amazon Music, part of Amazon.com Inc. \u201cOr, for our younger customers, to listen for the first time.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Are you more likely to turn to a streaming service to seek out new music, or as a convenient way to listen to familiar tunes\u2014even ones you may already own? Join the conversation below.\n\nWhen Spotify started, in 2008, it attracted mostly young listeners looking for the latest hits. The service has invested heavily in algorithms that create individualized recommendations for its users, who now number 232 million, and head of catalog Johan Lagerl\u00f6f said older subscribers are the next growth area.\n\n\u201cThis older demographic needs to feel at home when they enter Spotify for first time, because if they don\u2019t feel at home the first time, they won\u2019t come back a second time,\u201d Mr. Lagerl\u00f6f said.\n\nSpotify recently experimented with a feature called \u201cstorylines\u201d to highlight Motown Records\u2019 60th anniversary. Several playlists, including \u201cWomen of Motown\u201d and \u201cEvolution of Soul,\u201d include text boxes with stories from the studio, historical significance and what the artists said about the music\u2014material meant to replicate the liner notes aficionados once pored over on vinyl albums and CDs.\n\n\u201cFor catalog music you always think of boxed sets,\u201d Mr. Lagerl\u00f6f said. \u201cThis is a way of taking that into the streaming era.\u201d\n\n(Spotify earlier this year agreed to buy podcaster Gimlet Media, with which The Wall Street Journal has a content partnership. Meanwhile, Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.)\n\nWrite to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com", "description": "Older music is the biggest growth area in music streaming, as labels look to cash in on their catalogs and streaming services seek to broaden their subscriber bases to include people more interested in Led Zeppelin than in Billie Eilish.", "authors": ["Anne Steele"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103453/social"}
