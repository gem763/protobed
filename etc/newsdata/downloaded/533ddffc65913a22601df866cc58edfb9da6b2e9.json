The conversation was reignited Wednesday during CNN's climate town hall with Democratic presidential candidates when Sen. Kamala Harris said she's in favor of banning them.\n\n\"We do need to ban the plastic ones,\" Harris said, adding that the country should \"encourage innovation\" in finding alternatives.\n\nCities like San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., have prohibited the use of plastic straws. Several companies \u2014 including Disney, Starbucks and American Airlines \u2014 have announced plans to stop using them as well.\n\nWhy there's debate:\n\nSupporters of straw bans say they are a simple step that can help reduce the massive amount of plastic waste in our oceans that can be harmful to marine life. Advocates also see the bans as a first step in a campaign to reduce single-use plastics and a means to compel consumers to think critically about the environmental impact of their buying decisions.\n\nThe bans have been criticized by environmentalists as coming up well short of what's needed to combat pollution, since straws make up only a tiny percentage of the detritus in the ocean. Focusing on small items like plastic straws, some argue, distracts us from addressing the more significant sources of pollution. \"This is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said during Wednesday's town hall.\n\nOthers say the bans are discriminatory against people with certain disabilities, who may not be able to use alternatives like metal or paper straws.\n\nThe bans are seen by some on the right as a cause championed by overzealous progressives. Defiant use of plastic straws has become a popular political statement among prominent conservatives, including the president.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe campaign to reduce plastic waste has begun to move beyond straws. A number of states have banned plastic shopping bags. Several major hotel companies have announced they will stop using individual shampoo bottles. California's state legislature is considering a series of bills that would phase out single-use plastics entirely by 2030.\n\nPerspectives\n\nBanning plastic straws would be a symbolic gesture toward a greener future.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t about straws, it\u2019s about whether Americans are willing to evolve into better stewards of the natural world \u2014 or instead treat that very idea with contempt.\" \u2014 Miyoko Sakashita, The Hill\n\nPlastic straws make up a tiny percentage of the waste in the ocean.\n\n\"There\u2019s no doubt plastic pollution is a major environmental threat. But there\u2019s also no doubt straws barely contribute to the massive plastic blobs gathering in our oceans.\" \u2014 David Whitley, Orlando Sentinel\n\nThe bans discriminate against people with disabilities.\n\n\"People with a huge range of disabilities depend on plastic straws to access beverages and the very water they need to survive. \u2026 For so many people with disabilities, something as mundane as a straw represents independence and freedom.\" \u2014 Karin Hitselberger, Washington Post\n\nMaking straws available only by request is a better solution.\n\n\"Making plastic straws available only upon request will make a massive dent in the amount of plastic waste restaurants across the country produce. It will also demonstrate to new activists and environmental consumers that their voices matter, and they have the power to push for even larger reductions in plastic waste.\" \u2014 Juliana Britto Schwartz, Newsweek\n\nOutright bans unnecessarily turn the issue into a heated political flashpoint.\n\n\"Consumers are also more likely to accept change, whether it concerns light bulbs or straws, when the heavy hand of the Nanny State isn\u2019t involved. Government bans tend to generate hoarding, public backlash and culture war mutterings about having to pry straws from cold, dead lips. \" \u2014 Editorial, USA Today\n\nA straw ban is too small to have much impact.\n\n\"If we want to stop covering the Earth in discarded plastic trash before the end of the century, we\u2019re going to have to stop addressing the problem with minuscule, penny-ante policies.\" \u2014 Editorial, Los Angeles Times", "description": "Supporters of straw bans say they are a simple step that can help reduce the massive amount of plastic waste in our oceans that can be harmful to marine life.
