She spends her days beading traditional chaquira jewellery to sell at the community museum, and reminiscing about happier times spent fishing for tilapia and mullet.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez grew up in the Colorado River delta when the mighty waterway and lakes provided abundant food, water, medicines and spiritual nourishment for her people to thrive.\n\nIt was on the river that Gonz\u00e1lez, now 82, taught her children, just like her parents and grandparents taught her, to fish with canoes and traps made from willow trees which flourished on the riverbanks.\n\nNow, the river stops at the US-Mexico border and the lakes are dry and native vegetation is confined to reforestation projects. The only fish come from irrigation canals and the nearby River Hardy \u2013 a polluted 16-mile tributary of the Colorado sustained by agricultural runoff and a water treatment plant.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dry land where tidal waters from the sea meet the mouth of the Colorado River in Baja California Norte, Mexico.

But it is dammed at the international border and the US releases an allotted amount, which is mostly diverted into irrigation canals for farmland. The Colorado itself is reduced to puddles, a taunting sight during the summer months when temperatures can reach 50C (122F).\n\n\u201cI miss the river, it\u2019s where we come from, it\u2019s who we are,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, while chain smoking outside her modest home in El Mayor, Baja California. \u201cNow, everything has changed, the youngsters can\u2019t swim in the river and we\u2019ve no choice but to fish in polluted water.\u201d\n\nAt home next door, grandson Jaziel Soto Torres, 25, has bandages wrapped around both legs, to cover itchy blisters that erupted after wading in the murky River Hardy to repair a footbridge.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jaziel Soto Torres outside of his home in the community of El Mayor, with bandages wrapped around his legs, to cover blisters that erupted after wading in the murky River Hardy.

The population decline is partially blamed on the demise of the river.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Evelin Bautista, 14, in front of her home in the community of El Mayor in Baja California Norte. Photograph: Meghan Dhaliwal/The Guardian\n\nA 1944 binational river treaty guaranteed Mexico 1.5m acres-feet of water annually, all of it destined for agriculture. Today, at least 85% still goes to farmers. The agreement failed to consider the rights of the Cucap\u00e1 people and their primordial relationship with the river. As a result, traditional riverine ceremonies, medicines, fruits and grains, along with native trees and shrubs used to make houses, boats and clothes, are now scarce.\n\nLosing the river, argue Cucap\u00e1 leaders, has destroyed the social fabric of the community: the language is close to extinction, spiritual ceremonies are forgotten, and youngsters are forced to migrate.\n\n\u201cPeople abandoned the community because there\u2019s no river, no fish and no life here. It\u2019s cost us our language, culture and identity,\u201d said Antonia Gonz\u00e1lez, Inocencia\u2019s daughter who runs the museum.\n\nIn Arizona, the tribe, known as the Cocopah, has federally guaranteed rights to water from the Colorado, though there, too, traditional riverine customs and foods have radically declined.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Hardy River, a tributary of the Colorado River, with the Cocopah mountain range in the background.

US dams, brimming with excessive rainfall and melting snow, had released huge amounts of water, and Mexican flood defences were ill-equipped to cope.\n\nThe Cucap\u00e1 were badly affected, and forced to relocate from dispersed rural homesteads to tightly packed neighbourhoods. El Mayor has the biggest diaspora, and conditions remain basic: there is a hodgepodge of improvised houses and old American trailers divided by sandy gravelled roads, barbed-wire fences, and drooping salty pines.\n\nThe community has been blighted by alcohol and drug abuse, crystal meth in particular, as well as alarming rates of diabetes, asthma and cancer. Roofs provided by the government in 1979 were riddled with asbestos and were left in place for three decades.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Inocencia Gonzalez, 82, outside of her home. \u2018Everything has changed, the youngsters can\u2019t swim in the river and we\u2019ve no choice but to fish in polluted water.\u2019 Photograph: Meghan Dhaliwal/The Guardian\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not used to living like this, and being so close together has generated jealousies and divisions that never existed before. The biggest threat we face is internal conflict,\u201d added Antonia Gonz\u00e1lez, who teaches teenagers Cucap\u00e1 folk stories, dance and songs in an effort to instill traditional values linked to mother nature.\n\nNevertheless, the flood years weren\u2019t all bad, said tribal elder Inocencia. The glut of water meant the river flowed and the Laguna Salada, a vast sandy depression west of El Mayor, filled with freshwater and high tides from the Gulf of California, resulting in plentiful fish.\n\nThe lagoon dried up when the manmade floods subsided, forcing the Cucap\u00e1 to start fishing in the open sea for sea bass \u2013 known as the croaker for its deafening mating call \u2013 which congregate in the Sea of Cortez separating the slender Baja California peninsula from the Mexican mainland, between February and May.\n\nIt became an economic lifeline for the Cucap\u00e1, but croaker stocks are declining as a result of illegal fishing, corruption and the climate crisis, posing yet another threat to the Cucap\u00e1.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elder Bautista and his mother in front of their home in El Mayor, Baja Calfornia Norte, Mexico.

We were never consulted and no one has apologized or compensated us for the way our lives have been drastically changed by losing the river. The Cucap\u00e1 are river people, not sea people, but now we\u2019re being forced from the sea as well.\u201d\n\nBut there is some cause for optimism. Conservation efforts, which includes dredging sections of the dry riverbed and reforestation \u2013 are helping tidal waves from the gulf encroach further into the river delta to create small, glistening wetlands that attract hungry pelicans and egrets. For the Cucap\u00e1, restoring these natural aquatic connections could also help save their way of life.\n\nIn\u00e9s Hurtado, 52, a Cucap\u00e1 leader, said: \u201cThe wetlands bring fish, and the fish are what sustain us. We have to protect them.\u201d\n\nTo contact Nina Lakhani, the Guardian\u2019s new environmental justice reporter, e-mail nina.lakhani@theguardian.com.", "description": "The demise of the Colorado River has destroyed the social fabric of the Cucap\u00e1 tribe and is partly to blame for its population decline", "authors": ["Nina Lakhani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1998c5e6bf7fa2d0ee784748452f29dc82b6964/56_298_3904_2342/master/3904.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=693fdf0491788518ec8af96445e32305", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
