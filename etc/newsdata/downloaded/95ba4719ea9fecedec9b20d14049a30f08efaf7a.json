It should be voted down.\n\n\u2018I totally understand the frustration and the fatigue across the country and in this House.\n\n\u2018But we simply cannot vote for a deal that is even worse than the one this House rejected three times.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIf the deal does not pass through the House of Commons, the Benn Act kicks in which would force Mr Johnson to ask the EU for another delay until at least the end of January 2019.\n\nMr Johnson used his opening speech to rule out asking for an extension saying it would be \u2018pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u2019\n\nAll 27 EU members would have to agree to an extension, meaning a no-deal is still possible as it is the default legal setting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe revised deal is very similar to Theresa May\u2019s thrice-rejected blueprint.\n\nIt covers Britain\u2019s financial settlement \u2013 around \u00a333 billion \u2013 protects the rights of EU citizens and sets out a post EU transition phase likely to last until 2022 while new trade terms can be hammered out.\n\nHowever it ditches the hated Irish backstop, the measure designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border.\n\nInstead it will, in effect, draw a new customs border along the Irish Sea as Northern Ireland will still be bound to some EU laws on trade.\n\nThis has led to accusations that Mr Johnson has \u2018sold out\u2019 Northern Ireland in his hurry to secure an exit and flies in the face of previous promises the PM has given.\n\nSir Oliver Letwin has tabled an amendment which could see another extension (Picture: AFP)\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nToday\u2019s Parliamentary session is the first weekend sitting since the invasion of the Falklands in 1982.\n\nBefore the main Brexit vote, there will be decisions made on a number of amendments including one tabled by former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin, which could derail today\u2019s proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are fears that Mr Johnson will still be able to allow the UK to crash out of the bloc if no trade deals are agreed during the two-year transition period.\n\nThe Letwin amendment would withhold approval until all the legislation is in place, acting as an \u2018insurance policy\u2019 to prevent an \u2018accidental no-deal.\u2019\n\nHis amendment would automatically trigger the Benn Act, meaning a delay of at least three months.\n\nGovernment sources have suggested if the Letwin amendment passes then they will simply send the Tory MPs home and the main Brexit vote will not happen.\n\nMr Johnson held crisis talks with Sir Oliver last night in a bid to head off the crisis, but without success.\n\nLabour has officially backed the amendment and other opposition groups are expected to back it.\n\nRemainers are still pushing for a second referendum and hundreds of thousands of people are expected to head to Westminster for a People\u2019s Vote march later today.", "description": "Boris Johnson has made a last-minute plea to MPs to pass his new Brexit deal during a historic House of Commons sitting.
