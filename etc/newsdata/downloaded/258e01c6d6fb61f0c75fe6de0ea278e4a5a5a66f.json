Finally, Britain is going to the polls and running the general election which the Remainer Establishment had sought so hard to prevent happening.\n\nAs Sherelle Jacobs explains here in the Telegraph, MPs voted for the basest of reasons:\n\nIt has been quite something to see slick Remainers cook their own goose through a mixture of incompetence and greed. The Liberal Democrats \u2013 the Stop Brexit party \u2013 has just voted for an election that makes Brexit overwhelmingly more likely, so they can make a cynical land grab for Labour seats. Meanwhile, Labour has voted for its own funeral partly in a desperate attempt to save face, and partly because Jeremy Corbyn knows his days are numbered as leader \u2013 he would prefer to end his career embracing the warm socialist bosom of glorious defeat, rather than becoming the victim of a Left-wing purge.\n\nWhy was the Remainer Establishment so keen to avoid a general election? Because it knows it is going to lose this one, big time.\n\nBy Christmas \u2014 the election is on December 12, so plenty of time for celebrations afterwards \u2014 for the first time in history, Britain will have not just a Conservative party that\u2019s pro-Brexit but also a government that is majority pro-Brexit.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 MPs vote for December 12th Snap Election \ud83d\udea8 https://t.co/shnfcbz5IC \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 29, 2019\n\nBetter still, almost, here are some of the faces you\u2019ll never, ever have to see again, unless maybe you spot them rummaging around your local food bank, on the seat next to you at your \u2018Coding for Beginners\u2019 evening class, or on one of those photocopied pages of \u2018Do you remember who the hell any of these obscure people were?\u2019 they give you at the beginning of pub quizzes.\n\nAnna Soubry\n\nDominic Grieve\n\nNick Boles\n\nRory Stewart\n\n\u2018Sir\u2019 Oliver Wetwin\n\nGuto Bebb (But is he a Star Wars character or an actual person?

Rejoice!\u2019\n\nIf parliament had gone on any longer frustrating Brexit, if Speaker John Bercow had been allowed to continue molesting the English constitution like some hideous Hentai octopus, if Jeremy Corbyn had got away with his extraordinary scheme to hand over the franchise to 16-year olds and non-British European residents, then I think we would have had a civil war on our hands.\n\nNow order is restored.
