REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nNew Zealand-born Foran is credited with turning around Walmart Inc\u2019s (WMT.N) U.S. business as its president and CEO since 2014, with the unit reporting 20 quarters of comparable sales growth under his leadership.\n\nAir New Zealand Chairman Therese Walsh said the carrier was \u201cthrilled to have attracted a world class Kiwi back home.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreg has an impeccable track record in delivering strong commercial performance, outstanding customer focus and in building teams that can take a business to the next level,\u201d Walsh said in a statement.\n\nGrant Williamson, investment adviser at Hamilton Hindin Greene in Christchurch, said snagging Foran was a coup for the carrier.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, it\u2019s not going to have a major impact on earnings, there\u2019s bigger things moving in the background like oil prices and global growth,\u201d Williamson said. Air New Zealand shares were marginally higher at NZ$2.85 on Friday.\n\n\u201cBut in terms of someone to have a steady hand on the wheel for Air New Zealand going forward, I don\u2019t think they could do much better,\u201d Williamson added.\n\nForan, who boosted Walmart\u2019s sales by focusing on improving existing stores to keep costs and prices low, said he looked forward to building on Air New Zealand\u2019s competitive advantage in customer focus and care.\n\nThe airline is known overseas for its quirky safety videos and consistently ranks highly in global airline customer surveys.\n\nForan will join Air New Zealand in the first quarter of next year, replacing Christopher Luxon who departed last month after seven years in the role. Luxon, a former Unilever executive, had also joined the airline after a career in fast-moving consumer goods.\n\nDuring Luxon\u2019s tenure, the carrier was recognised globally as an industry leader for its focus on innovation, environmental sustainability and diversity in hiring.\n\nHowever, it has more recently faced challenges from a higher fuel bill and weak travel demand, leading the national carrier to report a 31% fall in annual profit in August.\n\nAir New Zealand Chief Revenue Officer Cam Wallace, who had been an internal contender for the top job, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, welcomed the appointment on Twitter.\n\nForan will remain at Walmart until Jan. 31, when he will be replaced by the head of its Sam\u2019s Club warehouse chain, John Furner.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve been highly impressed with Mr. Furner\u2019s work at Sam\u2019s Club... he does admittedly have big shoes to fill,\u201d said a note from Jefferies Group LLC (JEF.N). \u201cWe can\u2019t help but expect the market to react negatively to today\u2019s news.\u201d", "description": "Air New Zealand Ltd named Walmart U.S. boss Greg Foran as its new chief executive on Friday, bringing him back home at a time the airline is trying to control costs in a lower-growth environment.", "authors": ["Jamie Freed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439498974&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A02F", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
