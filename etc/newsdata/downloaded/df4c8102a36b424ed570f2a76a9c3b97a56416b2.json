That is what Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs, wanted to convey Tuesday at the Atlantic Festival.\n\nSomething Clegg said, however, caught the attention of many who are wary of Facebook\u2019s reassurances about preventing misinformation from going viral on its platform.\n\n\u201cIt is not our role to intervene when politicians speak,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.\u201d\n\n[The dangerous cycle that keeps conspiracy theories in the news \u2014 and Trump\u2019s tweets]\n\nFacebook announced in December 2016 that it would use third-party fact-checkers to examine flagged content on the site, which would then be down-ranked in people\u2019s news feeds and sometimes appear with a debunking link. The program has faced some criticism for not being transparent enough with the fact-checking partners and for removing fact checks on controversial topics after political pressure.\n\nThis policy, which Facebook said has been in place for more than a year, will only display fact checks on previously debunked topics that are re-shared by politicians.\n\nFacebook called the policy sparing politicians from fact checks part of its \u201cnewsworthiness exemption.\u201d Basically, if something on Facebook is newsworthy, or in the public interest, but violates its community standards, the website can keep the content up by citing the exemption. The newsworthiness exemption, introduced shortly before the 2016 elections, is a loophole in the company\u2019s moderation rules that was inspired by a very different kind of content: Facebook had caused a scandal by censoring a famous photograph of a girl fleeing a U.S. bomb strike during the Vietnam War because the girl was naked. At the time, Facebook\u2019s policy contained few details on how it would be enforced or precisely where it applies.\n\nThe \u201cnewsworthiness exemption\u201d already seems to cover politicians.. But Clegg\u2019s remarks on Tuesday were notable because they clarify the extent to which that policy applies to political figures.\n\n[Facebook suspends tens of thousands of apps following data investigation]\n\n\u201cFrom now on we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard,\u201d Clegg said in a written statement accompanying his remarks. Facebook will be more strict, he added, when it comes to ads run by political campaigns.\n\n\u201cNewsworthiness\u201d was, for years, central to Twitter\u2019s rationale for declining to act on some of Trump\u2019s tweets \u2014 including one saying that North Korea \u201cwon\u2019t be around much longer,\u201d which appeared to violate Twitter\u2019s policies against violent threats. (Twitter has, in other cases, disagreed that controversial tweets from Trump broke the rules, or cited an exemption for \u201cmilitary and government entities.\u201d)\n\nTwitter tweaked its policy over the summer. Now, tweets from political figures with large followings that otherwise break the rules will, in rare occasions, carry a warning label.\n\nBut \u201cnewsworthiness,\u201d as a concept, is inherently subjective and vague. It is newsworthy when the president tweets something; what about when he retweets something? Multiple times in recent months, Twitter has taken action against accounts that have been retweeted or quote-tweeted by @realDonaldTrump. When the president retweeted a conspiracy-theory-laden account claiming that \u201cDemocrats are the true enemies of America,\u201d the account itself was suspended, causing the tweet to disappear from Trump\u2019s timeline. At this point, it is not clear what makes Trump\u2019s tweets, but not those he amplifies to his millions of followers, newsworthy.\n\nTwitter also made a different decision on newsworthiness in 2017, when actress Rose McGowan\u2019s account was temporarily locked for tweeting \u201cprivate information.\u201d The tweet was related to accusations against Harvey Weinstein, and an attached image contained a private phone number from an email signature of the person sending it.\n\nInstead of looking at the politicians, Facebook has attempted to show its commitment to cracking down on misinformation elsewhere. This week, Facebook took down an \u201cI love America\u201d page with more than 1 million followers after reports uncovered that it was run by Ukrainians.\n\nRead more:\n\nThey turn to Facebook and YouTube to find a cure for cancer \u2014 and get sucked into a world of bogus medicine\n\nTop AI researchers race to detect \u2018deepfake\u2019 videos: \u2018We are outgunned\u2019", "description": "Facebook clarified on Tuesday that it will not fact-check false statements by politicians , citing its 'newsworthiness\" exemption", "authors": ["Reporter Covering Digital Culture", "September At Am", "Abohlheiser Covers Digital Culture For The Washington Post.
