There is no evidence the Bidens have done anything wrong. Former US special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker told congressional investigators on Thursday that he warned Trump's personal fixer, Rudy Giuliani, that claims of Biden misconduct were not credible.\n\nNo matter.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cWhat happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with ... Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMoments later he doubled down on his demand from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause nobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked.\u201d\n\nTo his critics, Trump\u2019s brazenness is breathtaking. He is openly flouting what Democrats and a growing number of Americans regard as an abuse of the presidential office.\n\nNormalising corrupt behaviour\n\nTrump is a master at flinging dirt, and he is more than willing to co-opt foreigners to his cause \u2013 even after the extraordinary events of the 2016 presidential election, which Robert Mueller's report showed was riddled with Russian interference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Trump feels at ease to speak so openly about his attempts to cajole foreign countries for personal gain raises two possibilities.\n\nThe first and most probable is that Trump has chosen a strategy of normalising his behaviour \u2013 to make it seem as routine for any president as putting on a suit and tie.\n\nAs he says of the transcript of his conversation with Zelensky, which set the impeachment train steaming, it was \u201cbeautiful\u201d and perfect.\n\nThis approach will work among his supporters, and history shows he wouldn\u2019t be the first to tangle with foreign powers for political gain. The story of Richard Nixon\u2019s efforts to sabotage Vietnam peace talks in the final weeks of the 1968 presidential campaign continues to emerge as research is undertaken in the era. Likewise, it\u2019s always been passing interesting that Iran released American hostages immediately after Ronald Reagan's swearing-in in 1981, ending a crisis that destroyed Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency.\n\nTrump\u2019s behaviour is in some ways more dramatic because he\u2019s putting it on the front page and every cable TV chyron in the land.\n\nThe second possibility is that Trump genuinely doesn\u2019t believe he has done anything wrong. In which case, the President is writing the articles of impeachment himself. All the Democrats need do is hit copy-paste.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach over the past few days has been to dial the invective up to 11. He has called the leading Democrat impeachment investigator, Adam Schiff, a \u201clow life\u201d who should be hounded from office for \u201ctreason\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continues to wail against the \u201cfake media\u201d, and \u2013 in yet another presidential first \u2013 took to Twitter and slammed his enemies\u2019 pursuit as \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d.\n\nThe president has even invoked the possibility of America sliding into \u201ccivil war\u201d if he\u2019s hounded from office.\n\nIt\u2019s a scorched-earth strategy that leaves no space for a Nixon-style pre-emptive resignation and final climb into Marine One. Republicans are acutely aware that Trump will take the party down with him. Conservatives who may oppose his actions are too fearful to cross the President and his rusted-on supporters.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is refusing to take even the slightest defensive shuffle. Bloomberg\n\nThe result is that America is locked into a preordained process. Voters are divided pretty much down the middle \u2013 as a number of polls have indicated in recent days.\n\nLike a black hole, impeachment is sucking all matter towards darkness.\n\nA congealing threat\n\nBut the crisis in the White House and Congress is happening just as another threat begins to congeal \u2013 one that may be even more dangerous for Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarning lights are again flashing on Wall Street that the US economy is slowing sharply under the burden of the trade war and a faltering global economy.\n\nManufacturing numbers \u2013 a barometer on a sector of the economy critical to the President\u2019s re-election \u2013 are turning south fast.\n\nTariffs continue to ratchet up, extending the burden on the American midwest, where farmers have been asked to carry the can for the conflict with Beijing.\n\nThe figures are so bad that many analysts believe manufacturing and agriculture are now in recession. Add to that a damaging industrial dispute at General Motors which is chipping away at the economy of Michigan \u2013 a must-win for Trump in 2020.\n\nFrom New Orleans came news that Bayou Steel Group filed for bankruptcy. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the company was \"particularly vulnerable\" to tariffs because it uses imported scrap.\n\nWhile many of those portents are overshadowed or masked by the still-strong US consumer spending, equity investors are again asking how long it can last as negatives pile up.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed\u2019s real-time GDP growth estimate slipped this week to 1.8 per cent from 2.1 per cent a week earlier. That\u2019s a far cry from the 3 per cent, 4 per cent or even more that Trump promised.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 1000 points over the past three days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnxiety over the economy, fuelled by the media\u2019s fixation on recession, is a huge threat to Trump,\u201d says Washington observer Greg Valliere, an analyst at AGF.\n\nThe turmoil in the markets has generated a predictable response from the White House: Trump has again hit out at Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and blamed the Democratic impeachment process for falling stocks.\n\nAlmost certain are more Fed rate cuts, further weakening America\u2019s policy reserves should the economy stall early next year.\n\nBut more significantly the shaky economic news and political firestorm are driving home how badly Washington is missing in action.\n\n\u201cThe spectre of impeachment and the perception of an embattled President Trump will make China even more reluctant to offer\u2026 structural concessions, thereby decreasing the chances of a substantive deal anytime soon, prolonging uncertainty, and risking escalation,\" says Libby Cantrill, a public policy analyst at PIMCO.\n\nOn the brink of losing control\n\nIn the meantime, Trump shows signs of being consumed by the political battle. Little else is coming out of the White House.\n\nHis press conference on a podium alongside Finland\u2019s President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 on Wednesday was stunning. Trump seethed at his enemies; his anger seemed at times to come close to boiling over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe lashed out at a reporter from Reuters. For the first time in more than a year of watching Trump press conferences at length, this correspondent had the unnerving sense of a man on the brink of losing control.\n\nNiinist\u00f6 did his best to keep things from going completely off the rails on a day when Trump was thundering about civil wars and treason.\n\nThe visitor opened his remarks by mentioning how he had spent some free time visiting Washington\u2019s most significant museums, places that tell the story of America's special uniqueness. He went to American History Museum, the African American History Museum and the National Museum of the American Indian.\n\n\u201cMr President,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou have here a great democracy. Keep it going on.\u201d\n\nSubtle as a Finnish winter.\n\nTrump loves a political fight. Impeachment gives him a vehicle to lash out at his enemies and galvanise supporters.\n\nBut impeachment could ultimately turn out to be a sideshow.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is unlikely to convict Trump. So it\u2019s the economy that poses the greatest risk to him,\u201d says Valliere.", "description": "The Commander-in-Chief is throwing haymakers at Democrats, but the real danger is the economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5714%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/29c087c229080ce1673ac8f305c6e6ccb4da513e", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
