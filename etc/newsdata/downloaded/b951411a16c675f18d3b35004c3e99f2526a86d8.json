God bless you all.'\n\nBenn had initially retired in 1996 with an 83.3% knockout record before announcing his return\n\nThe statement insisted that 'father time has NOT caught up with him at all' and that the veteran's 'preparation and sparring had actually progressed better than expected at this stage'.\n\n'He is devastated at this setback,' it continued. 'Years of organisation has gone into this event, and many people (aside from himself) will be affected by his inability to fight.'\n\nTalks are now ongoing between the Resorts World Arena in Birmingham, BIBA and ticket authorities as they try to rescue a show which already has 10 other fights scheduled.\n\nAlongside the likes of Chris Eubank Snr, Michael Watson and Steve Collins, the 'Dark Destroyer' was part of a golden era of boxing on these shores during the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nFans who had bought tickets to see his return can secure a refund.", "description": "The legendary former world champion was due to return to the ring next month - against 40-year-old Sakio Bika - in his first professional fight since 1996 but has cancelled due to a shoulder injury.", "authors": ["Daniel Matthews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20293620-0-image-a-20_1572355586862.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
