They seem to take any unions' support for granted,\" said Cabral.\n\nCHICAGO POLICE CAPTURE SUSPECT THAT WOUNDED OFFICER\n\n\u201cWhile [Trump's] candor ruffles the feathers of the Left, I find it honest and refreshing. He stands with America\u2019s law enforcement officer and we will continue to stand with him,\" he said.\n\nLahren agreed and pointed to a recent Democratic debate where 2020 candidates slammed the police and vowed to change the system when asked about the case of Eric Garner and similar incidents.\n\nOPED: I BECAME A POLICE OFFICER IN 1989 AND I WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN\n\n\"Absolutely disgraceful and all a part of their felon-coddling, anti-law, and anti-law enforcement agendas that seek to normalize law-breakers while demonizing the men and women who put on that badge and uniform every single day to protect and defend our communities,\" said Lahren.\n\nLahren also credited Trump for fighting against the \"War on Cops,\" which she blames Obama for \"igniting,\" due to his \"inability to stand up for our officers in the wake of horrific anti-police attacks in Baton Rouge, Dallas and elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Few presidents in our nation\u2019s history, and especially in the last 10 years in the thick of the War on Cops, have supported our brave law enforcement officers quite like President Donald Trump,\" said Lahren, \"...Though, let\u2019s be frank, it\u2019s not hard to be more pro-law enforcement than Barack Obama,\" she said.\n\n\"DC CONGRESSMAN PLANS BILL TO FORCE PROTESTERS TO PAY FOR POLICE OVERTIME.\"\n\n\"This president stands for, with, and alongside our officers -- not for show, not for optics, not for anything other than his deep love and support for those who risk it all to protect and defend our communities and yet, are routinely demonized and harassed for it.\"\n\nMINNEAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER BLAMES CITY'S 'ULTRA LEFT AGENDA' FOR FAILURES\n\n\"Thank goodness for President Trump,\" she continued. \"Amidst all this BS anti-police sentiment and rhetoric we have a president who will proudly back the blue -- and believe me, they take notice.\"\n\n\"The thin blue line is easier to hold with the leader of the free world behind it,\" she concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTo see Lahren's full remarks and for more episodes of Tomi Lahren's daily commentary offering a refreshing and unfiltered perspective on issues across the country, join Fox Nation and watch \"First & Final Thoughts\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
