This week we look at how to use pops of color in your home\u2019s living room.\n\n\n\nAdding bold vivid hues to your home might be out of your comfort zone, but going for pops of color in a big way makes a statement and can completely energize a space. \u201cBold colors add personality, character and most importantly, a focal point,\u201d said Alessia Corpino Roitman of Alessia Corpino Design in New York.\n\n\n\n\u201cBold colors create an impact; they can define spaces, and when a whole room is painted in a bold tone, it can cozy it up and/or create a sense of drama,\u201d said Richard Angel, co-founder of Angel O\u2019Donnell design studio based in London.\n\nTo pull off the look like a pro, follow these tips from top designers.\n\nMore: How to Pick the Right Kind of Hardwood Flooring\n\nConsider the Space Itself\n\n\n\n\u201cBold colors add a dramatic touch to an interior and depending on how significantly they\u2019re used in a space, they can actually anchor a room. Determine the overall effect you are creating. For instance, bright tones add an energetic, playful energy to a room while sumptuous jewel tones add a lush, dreaminess to a space.\n\n\u201cIn a sleek, primarily black and white space, accents might take their cue from a piece of abstract art featuring one or more primary colors. The room could easily be layered with a few accessories in the same or contrasting hues.\n\n\n\n\u201cBold paint choices are a great way to create a variety of moods. An entire room lacquered in a deep emerald, for instance, creates a moody lusciousness. Paired with some gleaming metal accents, whites, blacks and an additional pop of gold or citrus green creates an elegant environment while still making a color statement.\n\n\u201cIt can also be used to simply create a pop in an interior that is primarily neutral, or it can be the focal point for the overall design of a space. When an entire room is painted in a bold shade, I\u2019m less inclined to use more of it throughout the space. Pair it with contrasting shades or less vivid tones. If I am using upholstery fabric to make the bold color statement, I incorporate varying degrees of the color elsewhere in the room\u2014a patterned fabric on a chair or drapes, a carpet that both contrasts and complements the statement pieces.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Lisa Melone Cloughen principal of Melone Cloughen Interiors in Greenwich, Connecticut\n\nMore: How to Design an Eclectic Table That\u2019s Ideal for Entertaining\n\nCreate Balance\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are several ways to use bold color, ranging from an entire room painted in the shade for a dramatic effect, to using small accents that give just enough of a nod to the willingness to play with color.\n\n\n\n\u201cA focal point for a room can be created by highlighting an element such as a pair of doors, millwork or cabinetry, or even a piece of furniture that could use a color boost. Likewise, using a bold color on a ceiling in an otherwise neutral room can deliver a dramatic effect\u2014imagine a dining room with a tray ceiling that has a bold color on the upper portion to enhance the effect of a great light fixture.\n\n\n\n\u201cAny colors being considered should enhance the other fabrics, area rugs, furnishings and materials used in the space. These elements often provide inspiration for a bold color selection while creating cohesion in a room.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to use bold hues; it just takes some creativity. You might paint a pair of chairs in a bright coral to give them new life or paint a fireplace wall to immediately draw the eye. Often the architecture of a room helps determine the right placement for a bold color.\n\n\n\n\u201cCreating balance should be a consideration when selecting color. If a vibrant red is used as an accent, another arguably bold color ,such as a navy or charcoal, may work well. In this instance charcoal or navy could be considered bold for its depth and value, yet it\u2019s balanced by the red, and perhaps a lighter neutral to round out the color scheme. It also helps to repeat the hue elsewhere in the room to make it easier for the eye to travel through the space. If a wall color is done in a bold hue, perhaps bring in an accent pillow, throw or artwork that ties the wall color with another element.\u201d\n\n\n\nSet against Benjamin Moore's Color of the Year 2020 First Light, a pale pink, used on the primary wall of this living room, border accessories take center stage.

I usually try to define what the starting point of the room is first and then build around that.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe key is to balance [bold colors] well. There is a general tendency to just choose a bold color over a neutral palette, but I like to bring a few all-together. Black can also be considered a bold color if used with other colors or brass. It is very contrasty and bold.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most popular colors are greens, pink, blues and some yellows. People tend to feel safer with these colors and they remain classics. Remember, repetition is often a way to create cohesiveness.\u201d\n\n\n\nDesigned by Alessia Corpino Roitman, this home at 100 Barclay Street in New York bears a bold blue accent wall in the living-dining area and punches of color in the way of accents and accessories.

The same color can add height to a room, which works well in smaller spaces. You can also experiment and have fun by creating geometric patterns on walls, which creates an optical illusion effect and artwork in itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible to mix bold colors together, but they do have to be complementary to one another. We used a complementary paint color within a small alcove at our Shoreditch penthouse project to detail a single wall and highlight some important artwork by Sandra Blow, which might otherwise have been lost within the large space. Pick up the tones through art or accessories in the room.\u201d\n\nDesigned by Richard Angel, Co-founder of Angel O'Donnell, this penthouse at the Atlas Building features bold furniture and artwork with splashes of color for a standout space.
