Perfect timing, if you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to spend Christmas day eating way too much and then playing Crash Bandicoot for the afternoon while everyone else naps.\n\nJim Ryan, big man at Sony, confirmed on the official PlayStation blog that the next-gen console that was unveiled back in April is called PlayStation 5, and it will be released into the world in time for the 2020 holidays.\n\nREAD MORE Sony Has Dropped Some PS5 Details & It Sounds Like A Beastly Motherfucker\n\nRyan went on to chat a bit more about the new controller that comes with the incoming PS5, which includes sensitive, reactive haptic feedback instead of the classic one-buzz-fits-all \u2018rumble\u2019 effect that would leave your hands feeling a bit tingly and numb after vibrating in your palms after hours of gameplay. (RIP DualShock)\n\nThe other new thing in the fancy-ass controllers with the PlayStation 5 is the adaptive tech incorporated into the R1 and R2 triggers. Instead of just a single button for every shot, the new tech gives the feeling of tension and resistance, depending on what the character has in its hands.\n\n\u201cDevelopers can program the resistance of the triggers so that you feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain,\u201d Ryan wrote.\n\n\u201cIn combination with the haptics, this can produce a powerful experience that better simulates various actions.\u201d\n\nI can 100% assure you that my mum is going to want one of these, so I guess I better start saving now so I can buy her a bunch of PS5 games.\n\nWe still don\u2019t yet have full nitty-gritty details about the PlayStation 5 console yet in terms of firm dates or how much it\u2019s going to set you back, but we\u2019ll absolutely keep you updated on when that comes out.", "description": "Sony has officially named its next-gen console the PlayStation 5, and confirmed that it'll be landing in our hot little hands in 2020.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/playstation-logo-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
