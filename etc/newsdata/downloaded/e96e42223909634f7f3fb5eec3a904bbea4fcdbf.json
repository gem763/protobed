In contrast, focusing on mental health has been a more popular approach with those who would prefer there be no new restrictions on guns of any kind.\n\nIn his Sunday remarks, Trump said, \"Public safety is our No. 1 priority,\" but reiterated his support to \"protect our Second Amendment.\"\n\nHe lauded the actions of the local law enforcement who responded to the shootings in West Texas, and also said he spoke with Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\u201cWe will provide all possible support from the federal government in the aftermath of this wicked attack,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier Sunday, as he returned to Washington from Camp David, Trump dismissed the usefulness of universal background checks.\n\n\u201cBackground checks \u2014 I will say that for the most part, sadly, if you look at the last four or five, going back even five or six or seven years \u2014 for the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s previous remarks on background checks had been seen as encouraging by those who were pleased to see the president taking a position notably different from the National Rifle Association.\n\nThat has turned to impatience and frustration. \u201cThe biggest lies that the president has told include that he would do something about universal background checks,\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro said Sunday on NBC\u2018s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nA gunman Saturday in the Texas communities of Odessa and Midland killed seven people and wounded 22 others after a traffic stop; among the dead was a postal worker whose truck he hijacked. On Aug. 3, a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas; on Aug 4, a shooter in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine people.\n\n", "description": "The president takes a different approach after the latest mass shooting in Texas.", "authors": ["Bianca Quilantan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2c/9e/b7435f2c4f7bb72f1163e136971f/190901-trump-ap-773.jpg"}
