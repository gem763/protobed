He was the oldest and wanted to put an end to the way they lived.\"\n\nWesterbeek said Jan \"admitted that he had run away and that he needed help\" so he helped the young man by calling the police.\n\nCops later searched Jan's home and found his family living in the basement of the farmhouse. Some reports say that Jan's father was found laying in bed in the basement and that he suffered a stroke several years ago. Others said it was uncertain whether their father was found with the siblings at all.\n\nPolice arrested a 58-year-old man, identified as Josef B., on suspicion of deprivation of liberty and harming the health of others. Initial reports stated that he was the father of the family, but Mayor Roger de Groot later clarified at a Tuesday news conference that he rented out the farm but wasn't the siblings' father, according to Dutch News. RTV Drenthe reported that police do not know Josef's relationship to the family.\n\nThe children in the family ranged from 18 to 25 years old and had no idea there were other people in the world, according to RTV Drenthe. They were reportedly cut off from the outside world and lived self-sufficiently thanks to a vegetable garden and some animals on the farm.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The family was found living in a basement on Sunday, where they have reportedly lived for the last nine years waiting for the world's end.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9486/0de731bbc5d74bddae05ff35302b5156.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
