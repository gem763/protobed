Prograis went so far as to say 'close as it was I was not the better man on the night.'\n\nIt is Taylor who goes on in search of becoming the undisputed champion in a prospective fight against the holder of the two other alphabelts, Jose Ramirez.\n\nThat is a privilege earned by a momentous effort of will and courage in the teeth of a brilliant technician and one I believe to be morally his right even though it was so close that my card finished up reading the same as the draw scored by one of the judges.\n\nThe other two went for Taylor by 115-112 and a badly seen 117-112,\n\nSome 15,000 seats in the 19,000 capacity 02 were filled, up to half of them by many of whom had made the journey from Edinburgh in deafening support of their Tartan Tornado.\n\nThe American (left) lands a left jab to the head of Taylor (right) at the O2 Arena\n\nTaylor lands a shot to the back of Prograis' head during the opening round on Saturday\n\nPrograis came to the ring wearing his wolf mask in accordance with the legend in his home town New Orleans of the were-wolf like creature believed to infest the swamps of southern Louisania.\n\nRougarou is the name of that beast and the nickname under which Taylor's rival champion does his fighting.\n\nIf there were any howls from the US camp they were drowned out by the roar of the clansmen, which grew louder as his aggression in the second half of the first repulsed Progais' slick start to the fight.\n\nThe Prograis southpaw jab then asserted itself and once that platform had been established he began to run through his repertoire of quick-fire punches from sharp angles and brilliant evasive movement.\n\nTaylor was throwing combinations of his own, not without some success, but Prograis has demonstrating some of the variety to his work which he had said he expected to be vital.\n\nEven with his marked height advantage Taylor was still being outjabbed and mostly beaten to the punch. But he founds ways to rally through will and work rate and we were heading into a potentially special fight.\n\nAt the end of a particularly gruelling fifth they exchanged blows after the blow and referee Marcus McDonnell had to restore order in the ring.\n\nThe American shows off his red entrance gear and mask before the fight with Taylor\n\nTaylor had his best round so far in the sixth and this was as close as close can be. The seventh was even better for the Tornado and it looked for one moment as if he might put Prograis down. It was Taylor's turn to be hurt in the eighth of a tremendous battle.\n\nBack he came to stagger the American repeatedly in the ninth, perhaps with a hint of desperation as his right eye was beginning to close.\n\nMore significantly Prograis looked to be tiring in the championship rounds and began to buckle under the relentless pressure from Taylor.\n\nThe eye opened in the 11th and Prograis the wolfman drew heart and strength from the sight of blood.\n\nThey fought each to a standstill in a phenomenal last round which may have set the seal on a fight of the year.\n\nThe crowd rose in tribute to both men, but with the loudest roars of course for Taylor.", "description": "JEFF POWELL AT THE O2 ARENA: Josh Taylor has beaten Regis Prograis in a epic encounter to win the Muhammad Ali trophy and become the unified super-lightweight champion on Saturday.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/23/20228620-0-image-a-53_1572130157683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
