Just as the F\u00fchrer was gleefully empowered by the 1936 spectacle in Berlin, so the Russian President will doubtless exploit his country\u2019s games for political advantage on the world stage. And a savage like him simply should not be honoured with the Olympic brand; the Five Rings ought not to be sullied by association with Putin, who is \u2018making scapegoats of gay people, just as Hitler did Jews\u2019.\n\nI don\u2019t want to dwell on Fry\u2019s association of the 2014 Sochi winter games with the 1936 Olympiad in Berlin: the systematic incineration of six million Jews in industrial ovens bears no comparison with the marginalisation and repression of minorities in Putin\u2019s Russia, as shocking and deplorable as their \u2018beatings, murders and humiliations\u2019 undoubtedly are. I am more puzzled that an actor of the intelligence and calibre of Stephen Fry missed a golden opportunity to highlight the fact that Hitler persecuted gays as well.\n\n\n\nThe pink triangle was nowhere near as prevalent as the Jewish Star, but at least 100,000 gays were targeted for torture or castration by the Nazis, and somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 are estimated to have perished horribly in the death camps. So why they didn\u2019t get a mention in this letter is a little mystifying.\n\nStephen Fry is not without clout: he has six million Twitter followers \u2013 a colossal cyber-platoon which he has readily deployed in the past to mobilise support for his latest grievance du jour. He primes and pokes, and they obligingly agitate and demonstrate by screaming their objections and questions. Then they tweet and re-tweet their defiance and disapproval in concentric circles of engineered outrage, flooding the target of their ire with a tsunami of derision and displeasure. Invariably, their chosen victim is harassed into submission and bullied into issuing a grovelling apology, whether earnest or not.\n\nThe Auschwitz Museum: At least 100,000 gays were targeted for torture or castration by the Nazis, and somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 are estimated to have perished horribly in the death camps\n\nSo, instead of pleading with David Cameron and grandstanding to the IOC \u2013 over which the Prime Minister has no power or influence at all \u2013 why doesn\u2019t Stephen Fry call for a ban on British engagement with Russian music, theatre and all performing arts? Why doesn\u2019t he demand a boycott of Chekhov, Gorky, Gogol and Griboyedov? Why doesn\u2019t he demand a ban on Prokofiev, Pushkin, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky and Turgenev?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that UK companies abandon their planned productions of The Cherry Orchard, The Seagull, The Three Sisters, A Month in the Country, The Government Inspector or The Brothers Karamazov \u2013 all of which seem to playing somewhere in the UK over the summer. I\u2019m saying that Fry\u2019s rationale for a sporting boycott of Russia can logically be extended to an artistic one; indeed, it is far more attainable since that is the profession in which Stephen Fry manifestly has hundreds of very influential contacts and holds considerable influence as a theatrical knight-in-waiting (it will come). That is where his campaign ought to begin.\n\nThe excellent Cheek by Jowl theatre company, for example, frequently performs plays in Russian, and they are planning to take Shakespeare\u2019s Twelfth Night to the Mossovet Theatre in Moscow next month. There\u2019s nothing subversive about it: it doesn\u2019t equate Putin with the puritan Malvolio, or portray Viola as a revolutionary member of Pussy Riot \u2013 all of which may well justify an incursion into dangerous territory to show Russian scorn her own image. It is funded by the National Lottery and supported by the Arts Council of England. Why doesn\u2019t Stephen Fry demand a ban on this tour?\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will doubtless exploit his country's games for political advantage on the world stage\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t he urge British tourists and ex-pats to boycott the opulent $700 million onyx-and-crystal Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg? This cultural crown is just as much a part of Russia\u2019s global ambitions as next year\u2019s Winter Olympics. The recent champagne-swilling opening gala was headlined by Placido Domingo, and the guest of honour was an unsmiling Vladimir Putin. Why doesn\u2019t Fry phone his mate Placido and organise a global artistic embargo?\n\nAnd what about the Bolshoi? In November they are staging a series of Britten Concerts in honour of composer\u2019s centennial. Surely Russia\u2019s sequinned opera singers and ballet dancers are as worthy of a total ban as their finely-tuned sportsmen and women?\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Moscow\u2019s terrific Lenkom \u2013 a daring experimental theatre. And the Satirikon, the Sovremennik and the Moscow Arts Theatre, famous for Stanislavsky. Not to mention the Moscow Academic Satire Theatre, the Moscow Variety Theatre, and the excellent Malyi Theatre.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Stephen Fry foment his six million followers into demanding that Brits boycott all of the above, with an \u2018absolute ban\u2019 on all UK performing arts engagement with Russia? This would be well within his sphere of influence and would make a real, lasting and dramatic impact.\n\n\n\nHe won\u2019t, of course, because his fellow actors, dancers and musicians are notoriously poorly paid, and are likely to ignore him. Far easier to pontificate to scurvy politicians and preach about evil in someone else\u2019s church. There is no Equity in Russia, no guarantee of paid work and no minimum wage when you get it. Every contract in the arts world is highly prized, and plans are already well-advanced for next year\u2019s cultural Olympiad to coincide with the games.\n\nFry says: \u2018The summer Olympics of 2012 were one of the most glorious moments of my life and the life of my country.\u2019 As they were for many of us, not least because the daily ecstasies and exhilarations lifted us beyond the mundane drudge of everyday life. But Stephen Fry would seek to deny such delight and elation to the downtrodden, poverty-stricken and unemployed people of Russia. It isn\u2019t all vodka shots in the Kremlin: those that have somewhere to sleep at night often share kitchens and toilets with five other families. The Winter Olympics are a welcome distraction from cabbage soup.\n\nThis call for a ban represents no personal sacrifice at all to Fry himself; nor does it constitute any hardship for his fellow actors and artists. It is a haughty and detached gesture which harms the innocent and penalises Russia\u2019s outstanding sportsmen and women who will be deprived of their chance to inspire the very generation which might sweep Putin and his thugs from power.\n\nBy all means demand a ban on the Winter Olympics or a boycott of Russian sport if you must, but its theatre, music, opera and ballet bring just as much honour and glory to Putin as cross-country skiing, figure skating, bobsleighing and the biathlon: it is all culture readily appropriated for political purposes.", "description": "ADRIAN HILTON: 'An absolute ban on the Russian Winter Olympics of 2014 on Sochi is simply essential,' says Stephen Fry in an impassioned letter to the Prime Minister and the International Olympic Committee.", "authors": ["Adrian Hilton For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/08/article-2387093-121FC439000005DC-118_1024x618_large.jpg", "published_at": "2013-08-08"}
