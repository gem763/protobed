Over 75 models have weighed in so far.\n\nThe anonymous comments posted on Russell\u2019s Instagram describe a myriad of scenarios, with models describing photographers propositioning them, physically grabbing them, exposing themselves and sending nude photographs. There are also accounts of underage models unknowingly winding up in unchaperoned situations or being asked if they were a virgin.\n\nAnother commenter described how at the age of 17, midway through a normal shoot, she was \u201cbasically forced\u201d to take her clothes off to get in the shower so the photographer could take photos and he took advantage of her in many ways.\n\nRussell advised her 89,300 followers, \u201cIf you have been a victim of rape or assault 24/7 support is available from rainn.org,\u201d referring to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.\n\nExecutives at The Lions Model Management LLC, which represents the 30-year-old Russell, did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Russell.\n\n\u201cI think what Cameron is doing is very important. All models deserve the right to feel safe and respected. Unsafe environments should not be tolerated and abusers should be reported,\u201d said Steven Kolb, chief executive officer of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.\n\n\u201cCFDA puts its support behind Cameron and others who are speaking out. I also applaud the Model Alliance and their efforts,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe started the CFDA Health Initiative in 2007 to address eating disorders and underage models. In recent years we have encouraged more diversity on the runway as part of our fashion week outreach to the industry. I believe we\u2019ve been able to impact positive change with our work. While we have not been specific on sexual harassment, our Health Initiative is committed to the notion of a healthy mind in a healthy body, and there cannot be one without the other. I do think it important that we expand our Health Imitative guidelines to be more specific on harassment and it is something we will do.\u201d\n\nWhen James Scully, a casting director, posted on Instagram in February allegations that models were being abused during a Balenciaga casting, it set off a firestorm. He said he received almost 10,000 responses in the first two hours about abuses models had endured in their careers.\n\nHe said he got e-mails from girls saying that a stylist touched her. \u201cI discovered in speaking with other agents and other girls, I started to hear more stories like this.\u2026It was in the air, and we knew it. I didn\u2019t know the extent. Especially with these test photographers and those that kind of prey and take advantage of these girls. You always hear an isolated thing.\u2026You hear the stories and I was getting stories about stylists and a couple of photographers,\u201d he said. He said he would hear about sexual harassment and how a haircut destroyed a girl\u2019s sense of self-esteem, and the agency dropped her.\n\n\u201cTo get these e-mails from these boys and these girls is really devastating. Three days after it happened, I went home to 1,300 e-mails. From the girls and the boys and from their parents. The abuse overall is rampant, and the fact that it has become rampant is because it all became about power,\u201d said Scully.\n\nThe reason people don\u2019t speak out is because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll be blackballed, he contended. \u201cThat\u2019s where the double standard is the worst,\u201d said Scully.\n\nThis fall, Kering and LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton issued a charter to ensure the well-being of models. The charter, which has been implemented by both groups\u2019 brands worldwide, requires models to present a recent medical certificate proving their overall health, and bans the hiring of models below the age of 16 in shows or shoots representing an adult, among other measures. Models ages 16 to 18 must have a chaperone or guardian on the set during the shoot.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive officer of Kering, said at the time that the group had been working on the topic since 2015, but was moved to act quickly after Scully blew the whistle on several brands, including Balenciaga, Herm\u00e8s and Elie Saab, for allegedly abusing models.\n\nConcerning Russell\u2019s Instagram with all the models\u2019 stories, Scully said it was \u201cincredibly brave\u201d for the models to post their stories. \u201cI think what she did is awe-inspiring [and] brave. She\u2019s opened a door that was never opened,\u201d said Scully, noting that many of the girls who weighed in were under 18.\n\nFaith Kates, president of Next Model Management, said she personally doesn\u2019t hear that much about abusive behavior, and when an abuse has occurred over the years, she would call the photographer directly. \u201cI think Next is pretty powerful and the girls don\u2019t get hit [on] that much anymore. I think the ones that do are the ones that don\u2019t have great representation. We have a voice,\u201d she insisted.\n\nShe recalled an incident that happened many years ago when someone was giving a girl drugs. \u201cI went to the guy\u2019s office with a bag of goodies that he was giving her and I said, \u2018if you ever see me on the street, you should cross it.\u2019 And if he ever did it again, I would put him in jail,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of phone calls over the years,\u201d she continued. She said she tells her girls: \u201cIf you think ever that somebody\u2019s bothering you on the set, you call us and somebody will be there in 15 minutes. We do what we can do to protect our people,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Gross, author of \u201cFocus: The Secret, Sexy, Sometimes Sordid World of Fashion Photographers\u201d and \u201cModel: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women,\u201d addressed the abuse that has occurred in the modeling industry for years.\n\n\u201cI think that among the people who understand how the sausage gets made, there has always been an understanding that there are industries in which the bodies of attractive young men and women are treated as commodities. It has been a \u2018below the surface of the ocean\u2019 phenomena not for weeks or months or years but for decades,\u201d he said. In his 1995 book \u201cModel,\u201d he called the industry \u201clegalized flesh peddling, equating modeling agents as pimps.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin the trade that [statement] wasn\u2019t considered as a revelation\u2026.it\u2019s because there\u2019s a sense that that\u2019s the way things are,\u201d he added.\n\nAddressing why the Harvey Weinstein scandal has blown up and the issue of abuse in the modeling industry has not despite copious examples over the years, he said, \u201cModels are fungible. Models don\u2019t get the respect that actors and actresses do. Because they are seen with no skill other than being born with lucky chromosomes, whereas people are attached to actors and actresses,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t care as much. Photographers do not have the kind of power that a movie mogul has.\u201d\n\nHe suggested several reasons why sexual harassment stories from such industries as media, entertainment and modeling are coming out now. \u201cA crack develops, instead of being patched, it opens wider. In fits and starts we have been moving toward a culture that is not tolerant of this behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the election of Donald Trump, it doesn\u2019t mean that society isn\u2019t more woke. It is two steps forward, two steps back,\u201d he said.\n\nGross said he decided to open and close \u201cFocus\u201d on Terry Richardson, whose sexual abuse of models has been widely alleged. \u201cIt was made because I got on the phone with a lot of people who deal with fashion photographers on a daily basis.\u2026I asked who matters most right now?\u2026Not unanimously, but overwhelmingly it came down to Terry.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he believes the industry will change based on the outpouring of testimonials on Russell\u2019s Instagram, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think fashion can resist the tide of changing times because it\u2019s fashion\u2019s job to reflect the times.\u201d\n\nIf more models come out and the industry pays attention and changes its culture, \u201cmaybe it [the response] won\u2019t be, \u2018clean that girl up and get her back on the set.\u2019 Maybe it will be \u2018get that photographer the f\u2013k off the set.'\u201d\n\nSusan Scafidi, founder and director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham Law School, said, \u201cEvery model has a story of sexual harassment or abuse, whether her own experience or someone else\u2019s. Perhaps that\u2019s not surprising, given that the same is probably true of most professional women \u2014 and given that female models frequently start working especially young, with little supervision, and in a profession that focuses on their bodies. Most fashion professionals are just that \u2014 professional \u2014 but the very nature of the modeling industry can attract predators.\n\n\u201cCombating sexual abuse calls for a combination of louder voices, brighter light and better laws. The megaphone of social media can be effective in certain instances, in particular when either a serial harasser or a target of abuse has a recognized name or thousands of followers. Most of the time, however, the subject is a whisper in the shadows, inconsistent with the fantasy and glamour of the fashion industry. Models, like other victims of harassment or abuse, tend to be ashamed to speak or afraid of losing work. There\u2019s always another young aspirant waiting in the wings.\n\n\u201cLegally, many models who experience sexual harassment have no recourse unless they are actually threatened or physically violated, in which case criminal law may apply, assuming enough evidence to bring a case. Since models are considered independent contractors, sexual harassment laws designed to protect employees typically do not apply. New York State\u2019s inclusion of models under 18 in its child performer protection law starting in 2013 was a victory, but more legal support is necessary. In fact, in an era when traditional employer-employee relationships are giving way to the gig economy more generally, society as a whole could benefit from studying the problems experienced by models and creating structures to combat sexual harassment and abuse in every context,\u201d said Scafidi.\n\nAs for the timing of these abuses coming to light, she said, \u201cWhy now? The political disappointment of many women has given rise to a trend toward female empowerment, amplified by social media, which enables the aggregation of stories and joining of voices. Ideally this will translate to structural change, not just the dismissal of a handful of marquee male predators, but there\u2019s more work to be done.\u201d\n\nAt work on the second season of \u201cFood Quest,\u201d Kim Alexis recalled her modeling days and some of the trouble she had at that time, mostly with photographers. \u201cI had to set a healthy boundary right away. Harassment is when you set the boundary and they don\u2019t respect it anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would make it very apparent that it would be fun to go in the next room and roll in the hay. Verbal comments I would get a lot. But when they were trying to get you to go to bed with them, I knew that that was abuse. That was a \u2018No.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes women get that tough exterior sometimes. You have to walk around like, \u2018Don\u2019t mess with me\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s tough because in the business, people have access to your body, your makeup and your hair. People are touching you all the time. You yourself at 18 have to decide this is inappropriate, or the wrong time, wrong person or wrong comment,\u201d Alexis said. \u201cNow I\u2019m not sure that parents are teaching young models where their boundaries are and what\u2019s appropriate and what\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nReferring to the Weinstein controversy, a former casting agent and magazine editor, who requested anonymity, said, \u201cIt\u2019s the same in fashion \u2014 some really powerful people know things, but they\u2019re not going to jeopardize their career or reputations to speak out about it. It took a Rose McGowan to stir the whole conversation. Harvey Weinstein wasn\u2019t just a predator \u2014 he was a bully. There are a lot of bullies in our industry. I know that people get silenced because I have experienced that. There is kind of this cabal in our industry who know exactly what\u2019s going on, but will never say anything. Anywhere there is powerful people, beautiful things, \u2018creative\u2019 minds, you\u2019re going to have crazy, abusive behavior.\u201d\n\nFurther complicating the situation is the hiring of teenage models. \u201cWe need to look at why we\u2019re using models who are 14, 15, 16 in advertising for big brands that a 14, 15, 16-year-old could never afford to buy? I just looked at the shows again and there are girls who are really young \u2014 16. Why are we perpetuating these images of these young girls as women?\u201d the former agent said. \u201cIf you read Cameron\u2019s Instagram, there are girls who had experiences when they were 15, 16 because they were sent on casting calls and go-sees. The mom might be in the other room, but they are having a bad experience with some photographer. Maybe we have to say girls need to be 18 or older to start modeling.\u201d\n\nBethann Hardison, who ran her own agency at one time, said no agency would send a girl out knowing she could be in a situation she could be compromised. That was even more so the case in the Eighties. \u201cWith Eileen Ford, it was don\u2019t f\u2013k around. Wilhelmina [Cooper], Zoli [Zoltan Rendessy] \u2014 they were hard-core,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I know that boys have been told, \u2018Do what you have to do to get the job.\u2019 With boys, there\u2019s less care with them.\u201d\n\nWhile she allowed that \u201dsurely\u201d girls have faced incidents, Hardison said the problem of harassment leans more toward photographers and casting directors than fashion designers. Strict as an agent, Hardison said she believed that models seen out at night never got booked during the day. \u201cThat was my philosophy, so you make your choices. I was so strict. I didn\u2019t hang out with people where we had to do drugs with my clients and stuff like that. My agency was a whole other style,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt girls were compromised in the Eighties and Nineties for sure. But I\u2019ve never had anyone who I represented tell me that happened to them. But I\u2019ve talked to boys who have said sometimes things were expected. They could be compromised for sexual advances.\u201d\n\nFormer \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d judge Kelly Cutrone said she has never witnessed anything on set, but stressed the importance of women speaking up for themselves. \u201cThere is a lot of fine-line stuff. If a designer wants somebody to wear a sheer blouse, it\u2019s part of the job. You have to speak up for yourself or you\u2019re going to be expected to do certain things that could be seen as marginal. They\u2019re selling illusion and sex a lot.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in general terms, not specific to the fashion industry, Cutrone said, \u201cThere are plenty of women who have gone to work and it\u2019s been made very clear that if you make yourself sexually available, you\u2019re going to get extra things. Or they have gone to work and been physically exposed or visually raped,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026On one hand, you want to say, \u2018If you\u2019re tall enough to be a model, be careful because there are people looming who are sexually inappropriate and they\u2019re predators.\u2019 But guess what? They\u2019re in the hospital, the fire department, the accounting department, in the courts \u2014 wherever there is male culture there are sexual predators. They come in all different shapes and sizes and they work in all different places. They do not discriminate based on race, ethnicity or economics. That is a really huge issue.\u201d\n\nCutrone said what she finds most troubling is the online responses of women who said they didn\u2019t know what to do. So much so that she is considering starting an online community with a group to teach women about sexual harassment. \u201cIf women are in a situation where their boss is asking them to watch them shower and they don\u2019t know what to do.\u2026they don\u2019t have the confidence of their voice or whatever \u2014 there is a huge problem here. It\u2019s the same problem my daughter is going to have if she goes to a rock concert and she is not prepared for a terrorist act or a shootout. Women really need to be taught the seriousness of it and it happens every single day \u2014 everywhere.\u201d\n\nFormer model Jennifer Sky is at work on a memoir about her three years of modeling in New York and abroad in the Nineties. Recalling her modeling days between the ages of 14 and 17, she said, \u201cI was physically assaulted. Not only was I belittled by men and women on fashion sets, I was made to feel like just a prop. The thing is, maybe actors sign up for that. You sign up for a job that\u2019s tough and you\u2019re getting paid a certain amount, but these are little kids.\u2026The adults on the set should have been looking at us as children and thinking, \u2018Oh my gosh, we can\u2019t let this photographer talk to that little girl like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe argued that the look that many designers present is the same one that couture houses put forward in the Thirties. \u201cJust in the few past years, we\u2019re seeing people of color on the runways and other body types,\u201d Sky said. \u201cI was able to see the difference between a workplace that was unionized and one that wasn\u2019t because at 15 I also became an actor. The way I was treated on sets that were overseen by SAG were completely different. The fight that we are having now [is like] the one that actors had against the studios in the Thirties. When I returned to New York to finish my education at 30, the fashion industry hadn\u2019t innovated. The same archetype was on the runway \u2014 these very young, thin, teenage white women,\u201d she said. \u201cThe one change that would make the biggest difference would be if they made a requirement that 18 [became the required age] to model.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Lanza, a model whose career spans 30 years, recently posted, \u201cWhen was your first experience of sexual harassment? What happened?\u201d Reached Monday, Lanza said, \u201cThere are all these people saying that it\u2019s not an issue in the fashion industry. That\u2019s a total joke. I don\u2019t know anyone who I know personally who hasn\u2019t had some form of harassment in the fashion business.\u201d\n\nRecalling her first modeling trip to Europe as a high schooler, Lanza was taken by her agents one afternoon to go swimming at a house in Italy. \u201cFortunately, I had my own bathing suit, which was like a turtleneck one-piece. But some of the other girls didn\u2019t. They said, \u2018Oh, we have bathing suits.\u2019 But somehow they only had bottoms and no tops. Things like that were presented as really normal. I was 18, but there were a lot of 14-year-olds,\u201d Lanza said. \u201cAnd I was made fun of. I also remember walking off a job because they wanted me to take my top off. They called my agent and tried to intimidate me.\u201d\n\nHaving modeled for 30 years since her first major job with Herb Ritts, Lanza said, \u201cEverybody knew there are \u2018The Playboys\u2019 \u2014 these predators and I\u2019m sure a lot of the agents were complicit, too, bringing young girls to these villas to go swimming, not protecting them in a way they should have.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs na\u00efve as she was as a teenager, Lanza said she knew enough not to go anywhere alone. Depending on their work schedule and financial needs, some models may need a free meal or job prospect so they will run with similar crowds or go out at night (to events organized by club promoters.)\n\n\u201cGod bless Eileen Ford. She was known for being so strict \u2014 for a reason. Hearing that tape of Harvey Weinstein [with model Ambra Battilana, who wore a wiretap for the New York Police Department to try to catch Weinstein, but charges never materialized], that\u2019s the way that they are. They try to make you feel bad about it, and you\u2019re not the cool one if you don\u2019t do what they want you to do. It really affected me so much hearing that,\u201d Lanza said. \u201cEven women asked, \u2018Well, why was she in that situation?\u2019 Why shouldn\u2019t you be able to go to a hotel room with a man and then say \u2018no\u2019? We need to not judge women.\u201d", "description": "Model Cameron Russell is shedding light on decades of sexual abuse in the modeling industry.", "authors": ["Lisa Lockwood Rosemary Feitelberg Alexandra Steigrad", "Lisa Lockwood", "Rosemary Feitelberg", "Alexandra Steigrad", "Bridget Foley", "Alessandra Turra", "Robert Van De Kerkhof", "Misty White Sidell"], "top_image": "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/kors-dc-06.jpg?crop=0px%2C596px%2C3840px%2C2564px&resize=640%2C415", "published_at": "2017-10-17"}
