But you think, in a way, a bit of a novelty thing going on?\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIn agreement, Wes said: \"I think that was what we are going for. We didn\u2019t expect it the first time we were working together.\n\n\"When we came out on stage and got such an amazing response - everyone was pleasantly surprised.\"\n\nHowever, Eyal claimed they were \"super serious\" about competing and have their eyes on the prize.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nThe spiritual Islander said: \"We are super serious about this and performing is a passion of all of ours. To get an opportunity to do that is were just so grateful and thankful for.\n\n\"People don\u2019t expect it. Hopefully we can prove them wrong that we\u2019re not just one-dimensional people.\"\n\nOn the audition at Simon\u2019s house in LA, Eyal admitted: \"It was the most daunting experience and we were like, if we don\u2019t do well, then we\u2019re not going to do well [in the whole competition].\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nEyal confessed they were still working on the name of the band and are hoping to stay in the contest so they can grow.\n\nHe said: \"I think we definitely intend to carry on. I think we started off in a good place but know we have so much more to give.\n\n\"We want to make it through to the live shows as we can grow and find our sound and it will be a journey for us.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nRuth asked Samira what she knew about her fellow Islanders\u2019 singing talents.\n\nShe said: \u201cIn the villa I would always sing in the shower and Wez would come up and just harmonise together and I would be like, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d\n\nTo which Wez importantly added: \u201cNot actually in the shower! Just stood outside.\u201d\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "Eamonn described the Love Island supergroup as an X Factor 'novelty act' and admitted he was prepared to laugh at them", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20648469.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-18-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
