Previously having worked with playwrights such as 'Joshua Conkel' and 'Lucy Gillespie', Tara\u2019s recent projects include \u2018The Affair,\u2019 an exciting show produced as a benefit performance, along with comedian Amelia Bayler, to raise money for the national charity Faces and Voices of Recovery UK.\n\nIn this interview, she discusses her fascinating projects and details of the upcoming UK-based show.\n\nActing beginnings\n\nSabina: Tara, can you tell us about your acting beginnings?\n\nTara: My first time on stage was actually when I was just eight years old. I sang \u201cThe Leader of the Pack,\u201d a number one hit in 1964 for girl-group, The Shangri-Las and ever since that experience I have never left. After choir and school theatre, I was so lucky to get opportunities which allowed me to work all over the world.\n\nWhen I wasn\u2019t working, I studied privately with incredible teachers in NYC, including Larry Moss. Finally, my desire to learn and work on my craft further took me to Glasgow to study acting at The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Whilst there, I was also fortunate enough to complete an intensive month of training at Shakespeare's Globe in London.\n\nBest projects to date\n\nSabina: What are your best projects to date?\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

Film\n\nTara: I loved working with filmmaker Seanie Sugrue with \u2018Locked in the Attic Productions\u2019 on a new play he wrote in NYC. I\u2019m passionate about working on original writing and originating characters. I\u2019ve also been lucky enough to work with several brilliant and inspirational playwrights, including Joshua Conkel and Lucy Gillespie, under the direction of Nick Leavens.\n\nSabina: Where can we see your next performance?\n\nTara: My next performance, a cabaret, debuts at STEREO (22-28 Renfield Lane, Glasgow, September 30th, 8 PM). I\u2019m producing a benefit performance including an original show I\u2019ve written along with contemporary songs to help tell the story. My performance, alongside a local comedian, Amelia Bayler, will raise money for the national charity \u2018Faces and Voices of Recovery UK (FAVOR)\u2019.\n\nAnnemarie Ward from the Charity explains more:\n\n\u201cEach & every one of the UK\u2019s drug deaths is an avoidable tragedy and the failure of our treatment systems; failure of the politicians in Westminster and Holyrood to act especially is an abhorrent catastrophe.\n\nThis public health crisis is a consequence of a \u2018one size fits all\u2019, woefully inadequate treatment system; together with socially inappropriate conditions, poverty, and a class issue.\n\nFaces & Voices of Recovery welcome this courageous, heartfelt tribute from performers who have in their own words narrowly escaped their catastrophes. A night to celebrate those who have embraced their recovery journeys, to add strength to sustain it and to bring together our families to honour those we have lost\u201d.\n\nWorking as a producer\n\nSabina: Can you tell us a little bit more about your work as a producer as well?\n\nTara: Producing this new show was all about my own passion to contribute, to explore and to educate. I\u2019ve always been interested in giving back to communities in need and raising awareness on important issues. I believe in the work this charity is doing for drug-related deaths in Scotland and wanted to dedicate a night to celebrating recovery in Scotland as well as to raise money to help families and people affected by addiction.", "description": "Tara Bruno is an actress and producer who is making her way to the top.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Read More On The Same Topic Sabina Nasic", "Fashion Influencer Anne Welsh Talks About This Year'S Lfw Trends", "Interview With Award-Winning Actor Scott Butler", "Interview With Rising Disney", "Star Isabella Blake-Thomas"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/9/27/os/b_1200x630/taras-headshot-photo-credit-blue-photography-used-by-permission_2330559.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
