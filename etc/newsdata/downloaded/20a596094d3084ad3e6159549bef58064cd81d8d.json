Eddie Jones was supposed to name a team on Thursday, to face France in Yokohama. Instead, that final Pool C encounter was cancelled as the 'violent' tropical storm known as Hagibis continued its ominous surge towards this country, with all the indications that it is destined to wreak havoc.\n\nThe Red Rose squad were meant to be in Tokyo, finalising preparations for 'Le Crunch'. But once tournament organisers had confirmed the revelation in these pages that the game was off, Jones chose to head for a familiar, favourite retreat.\n\nEddie Jones has taken his England team to Japan's far south to regather World Cup momentum\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is being put on par with a category 5 hurricane with 160mph winds expected\n\nEngland spent a week in this quiet corner of the island of Kyushu, before flying up to Sapporo for their opening fixture against Tonga. It is also where Jones spent months fine-tuning Japan for their 'miracle' victory over South Africa in 2015.\n\nSo the head coach won't mind this return to surroundings he equates with productivity and success. But these are not the circumstances he would have had in mind \u2013 no matter how up-beat his public messages were on Thursday. Never before has a World Cup match been abandoned.\n\nNonetheless, Jones was adamant that this was factored into England's planning, saying: 'We've been talking about it all the time; about the possibility that this was going to happen. It's typhoon season here and you've got to be prepared for it. We had an idea it could happen and therefore you have to accumulate points in your games to put yourself in the right position in case that happened.'\n\nGranted, it can be argued that this does England no harm. By default, without having to quell any French resistance, they finish top of Pool C, which means they are likely to avoid Wales in the quarter-finals. Instead, they will be pitched into a last-eight clash with Australia \u2013 and under Jones the record in that rivalry is played six, won six - including a whitewash series win Down Under.\n\nThat is a very winnable match, but this build-up surely won't help England preserve their status as clear favourites against the Wallabies. This would not have been a part of any coach's preferred plan. The chaotic predicament deprives Jones's men of a chance to keep building up momentum and performance levels, towards a peak - ideally on November 2, when the final is due to take place.\n\nEngland will now qualify in top spot in their pool, and will likely face Australia in the last eight\n\nSo far in Japan, the English campaign has involved stuttering to a bonus-point win over Tonga, without being especially convincing, followed by an imperious demolition of the USA, who offered precious little resistance against a mighty forward onslaught. Then Argentina were dispatched, once they had undermined their own hopes when Tomas Lavanini was sent off early for a high tackle on Owen Farrell.\n\nNow, a week off. What was really needed was a tough contest against France, which brought out the best in them and provided valuable game-time. Jones was quick to emphasise that his players will be rested and re-charged, but maybe too much.\n\nThere is a danger of being under-cooked. They will lock horns with the Wallabies 14 days after their previous match, while the Australians will have had eight days to prepare, after their game against Georgia on Friday.\n\nNo team was selected on Thursday but Sportsmail understands that had the game been cleared to go ahead, Farrell was due to start again - as the England captain seeks a return to form after blows to the head in his last two outings. Henry Slade was also due to start. He is another who needs a run after injury. The same can be said for Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell.\n\nBut there are no more opportunities to reintegrate recent casualties. The last window has closed. A World Cup quarter-final is not the occasion to blow away cobwebs or seek to hone match sharpness. Of course, the French would not have just turned up to provide target-practice, but England would have been overwhelming favourites and defeat would not have been a terminal setback anyway.\n\nJones sits on the team bus after the announcement that the game against France was off\n\nIf Jones had intended to experiment again with the 10-12-13 combination of Farrell, Tuilagi and Slade, that moment has now passed. Likewise, Mark Wilson has lost a chance to press his case in the back row, and the same can be said for Courtney Lawes at lock.\n\nEngland are bullish in their belief that they can replicate and surpass match intensity in training. But there is nothing that can simulate the fervent intensity of a World Cup clash between old enemies. No in-house activity is quite the same as hostile confrontation. Training cannot beat Tests, as a means of necessary physical and mental edge and intensity.\n\nBut all Jones can do is try to drill his players into a sufficient state of readiness. 'We'll have a game simulation but we do that every Wednesday if we're not playing, or on the Saturday. So there's nothing different for us..'\n\nNowell, Joe Marler and Billy Vunipola are in recovery mode and Jones suggested that at least two of them would be 'running fully' by Saturday. If Marler is struggling for fitness and Mako Vunipola is short of game-time, loosehead prop could go from a position of strength to an area of concern.\n\nBut the man in charge is in philosophical mode. All summer he has preached about the need for his team to be adaptable, so this is the acid test of that mantra. 'It's the only preparation we've got, so it's the best preparation,' he said.\n\n'It is a great opportunity for us to regenerate, refocus and put a bit more petrol in the tank, so we're really happy with it.' So England are convinced they will be full of fuel when they face the Wallabies, but only time will tell if they can find top gear again, quickly enough.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN MIYAZAKI: England\u00a0flew away from typhoon territory and back to Japan's far south on Thursday night - on an emergency mission to reignite their disrupted World Cup campaign.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/20/19553002-0-image-a-4_1570737246001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
