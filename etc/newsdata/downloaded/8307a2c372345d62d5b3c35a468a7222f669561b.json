The post included a list of four online classes Brown is set to take in the fall semester: Introduction to Management, Technical Writing, religion course Death and Dying and sociology course Racism and Equality.\n\nThe 31-year-old star enrolled in the courses on Sept. 16, days before the Patriots released him, ESPN reported. Brown played football at Central Michigan for three seasons from 2007 to 2009, but left for the NFL before he could graduate.\n\nCMU representatives did not immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe NFL is investigating multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Brown, including a civil lawsuit in which Brown\u2019s former personal trainer accuses him of sexual assault and rape. The Patriots announced Brown\u2019s release just hours after Sports Illustrated reported that Brown had sent threatening text messages to a second accuser, an artist who said Brown exposed himself to her while she painted a mural at his Pittsburgh-area home in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a series of tweets Sunday, some of which have since been deleted, Brown said he \u201cwill not be playing in the NFL anymore\u201d and ripped team owners for voiding guaranteed money in his contracts. The Patriots are expected to withhold $9 million in bonus payments due to Brown after cutting ties with the embattled wide receiver.\n\nBrown also took aim at Patriots owner Robert Kraft and former Pittsburgh Steelers teammate Ben Roethlisberger, implying that they were treated less harshly for their own off-field missteps.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cOur office is presently investigating multiple allegations, some of which are the subject of pending litigation.
