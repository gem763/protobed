Robertson went on to invoke the Armenian genocide, in which the Turkish government killed thousands of Armenian Christians amid World War I and the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was assassinated last year in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president, who allowed Khashoggi to be cut into pieces, without any repercussions whatsoever, is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks,\u201d Robertson said. Robertson additionally blasted Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 with whom Trump has friendly rapport \u2014 as a \u201cthug\u201d and a \u201cdictator.\u201d\n\nRepublicans deliver rare rebuke of Trump, slamming his Syria withdrawal decision\n\n\u201cNow our government is saying you have a free hand to go into Syria, take out the democratic forces and take out the Kurds,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nU.S. and Kurdish forces have fought side by side in northern Syria for five years in an effort to extinguish the Islamic State\u2019s so-called caliphate.\n\nIn tweets Tuesday, Trump continued to defend his decision, denying that the move was tantamount to abandoning U.S. allies.\n\nAD\n\nWe may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters. Likewise our relationship with Turkey, a NATO and Trading partner, has been very good. Turkey already has a large Kurdish population and fully.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\n....understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of Syria, and they have been removed, any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. We are helping the Kurds financially/weapons! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nThe president has defended his Monday decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Syria-Turkey border, even after it was met with heavy criticism from Democrats and staunch Republican allies, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sens. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nAD\n\nGraham called the move a \u201cshot in the arm to the bad guys,\u201d while Toomey raised concerns that the withdrawal would hurt the United States\u2019 credibility worldwide.\n\nStanding by Donald Trump, Pat Robertson calls lewd video \u2018macho talk\u2019\n\nTrump typically receives little, if any, pushback from his own party members and loyal supporters, including Robertson. The conservative Christian TV personality (and onetime GOP presidential candidate) notably stood by Trump when his lewd comments about sexually assaulting women captured during a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape were made public amid the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAD\n\nRobertson dismissed Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cmacho\u201d talk and even compared the then-candidate to a phoenix. Other evangelical Christian leaders such as Jerry Falwell Jr. and James Dobson similarly remained steady in their support of Trump at the time \u2014 as did most white evangelicals voters, 81 percent of whom backed Trump in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nAs of Monday, Falwell appeared to be one of Trump\u2019s few die-hard supporters who approved of the president\u2019s decision in Syria, telling the Associated Press it was simply Trump following through on a promise to keep U.S. soldiers out of \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAn inmate\u2019s secretly recorded film shows the gruesome reality of life in prison\n\nPolice removed a man from an American Airlines jet after he forced his way onboard\n\nTulsa searches for graves from 1921 race massacre that left hundreds of black people dead\n\nAD", "description": "\"The 700 Club\" host, typically a stalwart Trump ally, criticized the president's move as a betrayal of U.S. allies.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yW0WlQaU8ge_nPMP0ZPJALC36Nk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WFJ5IBXJ2II6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
