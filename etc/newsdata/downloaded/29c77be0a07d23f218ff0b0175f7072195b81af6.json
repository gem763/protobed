REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier `\n\nTrudeau, who swept to office in November 2015 promising \u201csunny ways\u201d and stressing the importance of gender equality and the environment, faces an electorate more focused on the economy and affordability when it votes on Oct 21.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge amount of work still to do ... under a Liberal government, Canada will continue to move forward,\u201d he told reporters after launching the race.\n\nThe 47-year-old married father of three, whose colorful socks and classic good looks are often splashed across the international media, may have history on his side. Not since 1935 has a Canadian prime minister who won a parliamentary majority in his first term been booted from office in the next election.\n\nBut polls strongly suggest Trudeau may not win enough seats to govern by himself after a series of missteps that called into question his leadership while cutting into his once sky-high popularity. That would leave him weakened, relying on opposition members of parliament to push through legislation.\n\nLast month, a top watchdog ruled the prime minister had breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure a major construction firm avoid a corruption trial.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are probing whether there is enough evidence to lay charges. The Globe and Mail said on Wednesday that Ottawa was limiting what potential witnesses could say.\n\nTrudeau side-stepped repeated questions about the matter on Wednesday, repeating the government\u2019s line that witnesses already had plenty of freedom to speak.\n\nAndrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, said the Globe and Mail report showed Trudeau could not be trusted.\n\n\u201cHe has lied. He has looked Canadians in the eyes and said things that he knew were not true,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nA Nanos Research poll released on Tuesday showed the Liberals at 34.6% and the Conservatives at 30.7%. That margin would not be enough to guarantee a majority of seats in the House of Commons.\n\n\u2018PUNISH THE BUMS\u2019\n\nLiberals say they are quietly confident of victory and predict Trudeau will campaign much more effectively than Scheer, 40, who is fighting his first election as Conservative leader.\n\nBut Canadian campaigns can produce major surprises. The Liberals trailed in third place when the 2015 election was called but steadily improved to pull off an outright victory.\n\n\u201cThis is not a \u2018Throw the bums out\u2019 election. This is a \u2018Punish the bums\u2019 election,\u201d said Nik Nanos, head of Nanos Research.\n\nTrudeau, the son of former Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has broken major campaign promises by scrapping plans to introduce voter reform and allowing budget deficits to mushroom. He also angered environmentalists by buying an oil pipeline to ensure crude exports could increase.\n\n\u201cFor average Canadians, the key takeaway ... is that Justin Trudeau is not an exception, he\u2019s like other politicians,\u201d said Nanos.\n\nLiberals cite near-record low jobless numbers, booming growth and lower levels of poverty as grounds for re-election.\n\nWORLD IS WATCHING\n\nAlthough rivals may dismiss Trudeau\u2019s achievements, diplomats in allied countries say his focus on feminism, the environment and the need for multilateral organizations is important at a time when populism is on the rise and the United States seems intent on shrinking its global ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe are paying very close attention. What will it mean if one of the few remaining progressive leaders is defeated?\u201d said an official at one major Western embassy in Ottawa.\n\nScheer had surged after the SNC-Lavalin affair, but he appears to be struggling in Ontario, the most populous of Canada\u2019s 10 provinces, where a conservative premier is pushing through unpopular spending cuts.\n\nMajor planks of the Liberal platform will include measures to address cellphone and internet bills and a limited expansion to the universal healthcare system to cover part of the cost of prescription drugs, say party insiders.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau kicked off a challenging six-week re-election campaign on Wednesday and immediately faced new questions about a nagging ethics scandal that could cut support for his Liberal Party.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428945954&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B09Q-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
