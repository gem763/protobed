Elijah Cummings' death comes after procedure kept him away from office for weeks", "language": "en", "text": "Many are mourning the passing of Baltimore native Rep. Elijah Cummings, who died at suddenly at the age of 68 early Thursday morning.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, which is affiliated with Johns Hopkins Hospital, at about 2:30 a.m. EDT from \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d his office confirmed in a statement.\n\nThe news comes after he underwent a medical procedure in September that had caused him to miss a high-profile hearing on Washington, D.C., statehood and kept him away from the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which he chairs.\n\nIn a statement to the Baltimore Sun, Cummings initially predicted he would be back after a week, but then later extended that timeline when the paper probed a week later.\n\n\u201cI am recovering following my medical procedure and remain in constant communication with my staff and my colleagues in the Congress,\u201d Cummings said in a statement to the paper on Sept. 30. \u201cMy doctors anticipate that I will be returning to Washington, D.C., when the House comes back into session in two weeks.\u201d\n\nHis office didn't immediately respond to a request from USA TODAY about the September procedure.\n\nThe congressman has had health problems in recent years causing him to use a wheelchair and a walker whenever he stands.\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, he underwent a minimally invasive heart procedure in 2017 that led to an infection. He was also later hospitalized for a knee infection.\n\nHis wife Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party, said in a statement Thursday that her husband was an honorable man who served his district with \u201cdignity, integrity, compassion and humility.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation\u2019s diversity was our promise, not our problem. It has been an honor to walk by his side on this incredible journey. I loved him deeply and will miss him dearly,\" she said.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Elijah Cummings death: Maryland Democrat recently underwent procedure", "description": "As chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee, he helped lead the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Adrianna Rodriguez", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7Y5LcK8RV_F5YTzKPQi.5A--~B/aD0zNjMyO3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/76ffcadd944583b043bf43ec79d0d081", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
