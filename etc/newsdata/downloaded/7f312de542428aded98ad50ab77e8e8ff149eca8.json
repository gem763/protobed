I get all the responsibility because it happened under my watch,\u201d Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in a preview for an upcoming PBS documentary, \u201cThe Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nHe has not spoken publicly about Khashoggi\u2019s murder last year in a Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. U.S. intelligence and politicians have accused the crown prince of ordering the killing, but the Saudi government has denied it, claiming rogue operatives are the cause of his death.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s death led to a public outcry, damaging the crown prince\u2019s and Saudi Arabia\u2019s reputation and attempts to diversify their economy.\n\nWhen PBS\u2019 Martin Smith asked how he didn\u2019t know of the killing, the crown prince said: \u201cWe have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the murderers could have taken government aircraft, he said: \u201cI have officials, ministers to follow things, and they\u2019re responsible. They have the authority to do that.\u201d\n\nEleven Saudis have been put on trial for the killing and the United Nations has called for an investigation into the crown prince and his administration.\n\nKhashoggi went missing on Oct. 2 after walking into an Istanbul consulate to collect papers for his wedding. His remains have yet to be found, but his body was dismembered and removed from the premises.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
