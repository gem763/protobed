(AP) \u2014 With snow ready to fall, the scramble was on to collect as many ponderosa pine cones as possible.\n\nA crew outfitted with spurs, ropes and hard hats scaled hefty tree trunks and used long clippers to snip branches loaded with the prickly orbs.\n\nThe cones being gathered in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico represent the fruits of a bumper crop. Every decade or so, the trees turn out more seeds to ensure future propagation as a hedge against hungry predators and whatever other hurdles nature might throw at the species.\n\nThe cones will be dried, their seeds cleaned, sorted and grown into seedlings that can be used to reforest fire-scarred hillsides. Similar work is ongoing in Colorado, South Dakota and other places in the U.S. West.\n\nWith warmer temperatures, more frequent drought and the severity of wildfires on the rise, scientists say seed collection and reforestation efforts are becoming more important.\n\n\"We've had so many large, high-severity fires in the state, and without our intervention there is a possibility that some of those areas will never be forests again,\" said Sarah Hurteau with The Nature Conservancy in New Mexico. \"What we're trying to do is collect the seed to help reforest these areas. This is a huge effort.\"\n\nThe goal: 1 million seeds.\n\nIt might sound lofty, but those helping with the project in New Mexico and southern Colorado are looking to take advantage of a rare bumper crop this fall that has resulted from back-to-back summer and winter seasons of average to above-average rain and snow. This doesn't happen often in the arid Southwest, and scientists say it could become more infrequent as the climate changes.\n\nKyle Rodman, a post-doctoral research assistant at the University of Colorado Boulder, studied the density of seedlings that sprouted following fires between 1988 and 2010. In a study published this month, he and his colleagues found the absence of viable seeds can drastically hamper a forest's ability to recover and that some burned areas were more vulnerable than others.\n\n\"The ability of trees to produce seed has a huge implication for natural recovery,\" he said. \"If the seed is not being produced, then it can't get to the places that are disturbed, then the chances for the ecosystem to recover to that forested state are obviously pretty low.\"\n\nIn comes Steven Sandoval and his forestry crew from Santa Clara Pueblo, one of dozens of partners in the seed collecting effort. Sandoval's crew has been charged with scouting parts of Bandelier National Monument to locate those ponderosa stands with the greatest potential.\n\nCone picking is a science, much different than a leisurely stroll through the woods to collect cones from the forest floor. Crew members are looking for the perfect cones \u2014 no curves, no sap, no insect bore holes.\n\nOne such tree was standing not far from the trail atop Bandelier's Burnt Mesa. Loaded with cones, it took more than an hour to harvest.\n\nLabor- and time-intensive, but necessary, says Meredith Prentice who leads a seed crew with the Ecological Restoration Institute.\n\n\"There's a lot of catastrophic elements like wildfire and drought. It's being exacerbated by climate change, and so the pool of native species that we're able to get seed from is shrinking because their environments are getting destroyed,\" she said.\n\nFrom their vantage point atop the mesa, the cone pickers can see for miles past the monument boundary and deeper into the canyons that make up the Jemez Mountains. It's a landscape that has seen several devastating fires in just the past 20 years.\n\nOverall, the number of fires in the U.S. has decreased slightly over the past three decades, but the number of acres burned is on the rise. Every year since 2000, an average of 10,900 square miles (28,231 square kilometers) have been charred, according to figures compiled by the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nLast year marked a year of particularly dangerous and destructive fires. More than 100 lives were lost in California, with the Camp Fire accounting for most of those deaths. Nationwide, more than 25,000 structures were destroyed.\n\nFar less land has burned this year, but scientists are confident in their predictions that the combination of overgrown forests and hotter, drier conditions increase the threat of catastrophic fires.", "description": "With snow ready to fall, the scramble was on to collect as many ponderosa pine cones as possible.
