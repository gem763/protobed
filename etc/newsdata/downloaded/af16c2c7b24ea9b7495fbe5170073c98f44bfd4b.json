Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action.\"\n\nThunberg, who arrived in New York last month, established herself as a key figure in the fight for climate action after she staged weekly sit-ins outside the Swedish Parliament.\n\nHer actions fostered a youth climate movement, which led to young people holding protests in more than 100 cities worldwide.\n\nWant more news?", "description": "When Greta met Obama: 'You and me, we're a team,' says former US president", "authors": ["Emma Beswick"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/16/54/52/1000x563_cmsv2_60c2317e-64f7-5cf3-8d43-eb05fa2ac73d-4165452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
