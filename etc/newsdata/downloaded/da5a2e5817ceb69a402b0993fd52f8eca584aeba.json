He obtained a bachelor's degree in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad in 1996, and a Master's and PhD in Koranic studies from Iraq's Saddam University for Islamic Studies in 1999 and 2007 respectively.\n\nUntil 2004, Baghdadi spent his graduate school years living in the Tobchi neighbourhood of Baghdad with his two wives and six children.\n\nHe taught Koranic recitation to neighbourhood children at the local mosque, where he was also the star of its football club.\n\nDuring Baghdadi's time in graduate school, his uncle persuaded him to join the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nBaghdadi quickly gravitated towards the few violent ultra-conservatives in the Islamist movement and by 2000, under their tutelage, had embraced Salafist jihadism.\n\nActivist to insurgent\n\nWithin months of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, Baghdadi helped found the insurgent group Jaysh Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamaah (Army of the People of the Sunnah and Communal Solidarity).\n\nIn February 2004, US forces arrested Baghdadi in Falluja and sent him to a detention facility at Camp Bucca, where he remained for 10 months.\n\nWhile in detention, Baghdadi devoted himself to religious matters, leading prayers, preaching Friday sermons, and conducting classes for prisoners.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The US held Baghdadi at a detention centre in Iraq for 10 months\n\nAccording to a fellow inmate, Baghdadi was taciturn but had a knack for moving between the rival factions at the facility, where former Saddam loyalists and jihadists mingled.\n\nBaghdadi formed alliances with many of them and stayed in touch when he was freed in December 2004.\n\nAfter his release, Baghdadi contacted a spokesman for al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), a local al-Qaeda affiliate run by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nImpressed with Baghdadi's religious scholarship, the spokesman convinced Baghdadi to go to Damascus, where he was to ensure AQI's propaganda adhered to the principles of ultra-conservative Islam.\n\nZarqawi was killed in June 2006 by a US air strike and was succeeded by an Egyptian, Abu Ayyub al-Masri.\n\nThat October, Masri dissolved AQI and founded the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). The group continued to privately pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda.\n\nThe new emir\n\nBecause of Baghdadi's religious credentials and his ability to bridge the divide between the foreigners who founded ISI and the local Iraqis who later joined the group, Baghdadi steadily rose through the ranks.\n\nHe was appointed supervisor of the Sharia Committee and named to the 11-member Shura Council that advised ISI's emir, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Baghdadi exploited the chaos in Syria to gain a foothold there for Islamic State\n\nBaghdadi was later appointed to ISI's Co-ordination Committee, which oversaw communication with the group's commanders in Iraq.\n\nAfter the deaths of ISI's founder and its emir in April 2010, the Shura Council chose Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to be the new emir.\n\nBaghdadi set about rebuilding the organisation, which had been decimated by US special operations forces.\n\nHoping to capitalise on growing unrest in Syria in 2011, Baghdadi ordered one of his Syrian operatives to establish a secret branch of ISI in the country, later known as al-Nusra Front.\n\nAdvent of Isis\n\nBaghdadi soon fell out with the leader of al-Nusra, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, who wanted to collaborate with the mainstream Sunni rebels fighting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nBut Baghdadi wanted to establish his own state through brute force before going after Assad.\n\nIn the spring of 2013, Baghdadi announced that al-Nusra was part of ISI, which he renamed \"Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant\" (Isis/Isil).\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption So-called Islamic State was formed in defiance of the al-Qaeda leadership\n\nWhen al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to grant al-Nusra its independence, Baghdadi refused. In February 2014, Zawahiri expelled Isis from al-Qaeda.\n\nIsis responded by fighting al-Nusra and consolidating its hold on eastern Syria, where Baghdadi imposed harsh religious laws.\n\nIts stronghold secure, Baghdadi ordered his men to expand into western Iraq.\n\nThe caliph\n\nIn June 2014, Isis captured Iraqi's second largest city, Mosul, and soon after, the group's spokesman proclaimed the return of the caliphate, renaming Isis \"Islamic State\".\n\nDays later, Baghdadi delivered a Friday sermon in Mosul and declared himself caliph.\n\nThe media has wrongly reported Baghdadi's demise several times.\n\nBut if he dies, the organisation will lose a skilled mediator, a ruthless politician, a religious scholar, and a man of noble lineage - an unusual combination for the leader of a global militant organisation, much less a proto-state.\n\nWilliam McCants is the author of The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State.
