He was 68.\n\nA powerful speaker with a formidable presence, Cummings had clashed with Trump on subjects ranging from congressional oversight of the White House to Trump\u2019s attacks on Cummings\u2019 native city of Baltimore, which the president called \u201crat-infested.\u201d\n\nCummings responded in a speech early in August at the National Press Club, saying that high-level government officials should \u201cstop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior.\u201d\n\nCummings died of \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d his office said in a statement. He had been absent recently from Congress, to which he was first elected in 1996.\n\nThe barrel-chested Cummings was the son of African-American sharecroppers. He rose to lead the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee, one of three congressional panels leading an impeachment inquiry that was launched on Sept. 24, after Trump asked Ukraine to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden. The panel has been involved in fights with the Trump administration over subpoenas challenged by the president.\n\nIn a time of particularly bitter partisan divide in Washington, top Democrats and Republicans alike voiced praise for Cummings on Thursday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said flags would be lowered to half-staff at the Capitol building to mark his death.\n\n\u201cIn the House, Elijah was our North Star. He was a leader of towering character and integrity, whose stirring voice and steadfast values pushed the Congress and country to rise always to a higher purpose,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nShe recalled that earlier this year, Cummings said: \u201cWhen we\u2019re dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?\u201d\n\nRepublican Representative Mark Meadows, one of the most conservative members of the House, said on Twitter of his Oversight Committee colleague: \u201cThere was no stronger advocate and no better friend than Elijah Cummings.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Maloney to be acting House oversight chair after Cummings death aide\n\nCummings told the Washington Post earlier this year that he considered Meadows a good friend, even though they disagreed on almost all issues.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama called Cummings \u201csteely but compassionate\u201d and said he \u201cshowed us all not only the importance of checks and balances within our democracy, but also the necessity of good people stewarding it.\u201d\n\nDISTRICT DEFENDER\n\nCummings was a trial lawyer before being elected to office to represent Baltimore and other parts of central Maryland. He graduated from Howard University and the University of Maryland School of Law.\n\nHe spent 14 years in the state legislature, becoming the first African-American to be named state House Speaker Pro Tempore, who presides over the chamber when the Speaker is absent.\n\nWhen he moved to Congress, he succeeded Kweisi Mfume, who went on to lead the NAACP civil rights group.\n\nCummings\u2019 standing with his constituents was clear during the 2015 riots in Baltimore after Freddie Gray, an unarmed black man, was killed when police gave him a \u201crough ride\u201d in the back of a van after arresting him.\n\nFollowing a night of arson and violence, Cummings served as a calming presence in the streets, mingling with people and listening to their anger.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the destruction, you\u2019ve also got to realize there\u2019s pain, there\u2019s pain behind a lot of this,\u201d Cummings said near a drug store that was burned during the rioting.\n\nThis year, Cummings harshly criticized Trump's immigration policy and gave a tongue-lashing to U.S. Department of Homeland Security here officials over conditions for migrants detained along the southern border.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings (D-MD) speaks with reporters after meeting with President Donald Trump about prescription drug prices at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\n\u201cNone of us would have our children in that position,\u201d Cummings thundered in July, accusing the administration of erecting \u201cchild internment camps.\u201d\n\nCummings said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d the president was a racist, after Trump attacked four minority congresswomen on Twitter.\n\nHe told the Baltimore Sun that he didn\u2019t think Trump understood \u201cwhat it feels like to be treated like less than a dog,\u201d recalling white mobs that threw rocks and bottles at Cummings and other African-Americans seeking to integrate a swimming pool in Baltimore decades ago.\n\nTrump then lashed out at Cummings on Twitter, calling the Congressman a \u201cbrutal bully\u201d who represented a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested\u201d district.\n\nDespite their differences, Trump issued condolences to Cummings\u2019 family and friends on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!\u201d Trump said on Twitter.\n\nMULTIPLE PROBES OF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\n\nCummings had served as oversight chairman since January after the Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in 2018 elections, and he plunged into multiple investigations of Trump\u2019s personal finances and possible abuses at federal agencies.\n\nBefore the impeachment inquiry was officially launched at the end of September, Cummings\u2019 committee was investigating whether Trump had used his office to enrich himself, his family or his businesses including Trump hotels.\n\nRepresentative Carolyn Maloney will be the committee\u2019s acting chair until a permanent one is chosen, a senior Democratic leadership aide said, adding that \u201cthe caucus process to elect a permanent chair will be announced at a later time.\u201d\n\nLast year, when Cummings was off work for a lengthy period due to knee problems, Maloney and another Democrat, Gerald Connolly, shared the duties of running the oversight panel.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nMaryland Governor Larry Hogan has 10 days to lay out a schedule for holding special primary and general elections to replace Cummings, a process that could take until early next year to unfold. The district, with a majority African-American population, is expected to stay in Democratic hands.\n\nFellow Democrats noted the large void left by Cummings\u2019 passing, and the outsized role he played.\n\n\u201cToday we have lost a giant,\u201d U.S. House Majority Whip James Clyburn said.\n\nCummings \u201cspoke truth to power,\u201d said the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Hakeem Jeffries.", "description": "U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, a civil rights champion who over the last quarter century became one of the most influential Democrats in Congress and a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, died on Thursday.
