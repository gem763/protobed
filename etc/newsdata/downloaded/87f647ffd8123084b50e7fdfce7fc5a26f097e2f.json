The University also welcomes student engagement on this very important issue,\" the university said.\n\nThe university noted an independent investigator is now working on the second part of her mandate, which involves a review of its security policies and procedures \"and report on their impacts on racialized community members.\"\n\nThat report is expected next month, and will be made public, the university said.", "description": "More than 100 professors\u00a0and librarians\u00a0at the University of Ottawa are urging school officials to listen to student demands\u00a0to take tougher action against\u00a0racism on campus.", "authors": ["Hillary Johnstone"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290798.1571243164!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wiliston-mason-sept-19-2019.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
