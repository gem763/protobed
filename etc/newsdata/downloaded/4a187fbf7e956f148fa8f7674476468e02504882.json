Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned that Turkey\u2019s offensive would permanently \"destroy\" the relationship.\n\nThat anger reveals two things, Cagaptay says.\n\nFirst, the \"temporary, transactional relationship\" with Kurdish forces was increasingly viewed in Washington as \"a permanent, strategic one.\"\n\nSecond, \"dislike of Erdogan is so strong in certain circles in Washington, including the Hill, that it distorts Turkey policy,\" Cagaptay says.\n\nThe view from Turkey\n\nWhile Turkey is polarized on most issues, Cagaptay says, nearly 90% of the country backs Erdogan's fight against the YPG.\n\n\"I think many policymakers and analysts have forgotten that the idea that the YPG is different from the PKK is basically a fig leaf that the U.S. invented so it would not be giving weapons to a terrorist group,\" he continues.\n\n\"If you think the YPG and PKK are different, what Turkey is doing becomes completely unacceptable,\" he says.\n\nBut if you agree they're the same, he says, this is a U.S. ally attacking its \"sworn enemy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, resentment over the 4 million Syria refugees Turkey has taken in has been intensified by an economic downturn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s forcing Erdogan to make it look like he\u2019s doing something to address the refugee problem. And that something will be to repatriate some refugees into Syria,\u201d Cagaptay says.\n\nThe Turkish offensive\n\nCagaptay refers to Turkey's offensive as \"a war that is not a war\" because he's not expecting \"massive fighting and massive bloodshed.\"\n\nThe offensive is focused on an Arab-majority corridor where Turkish troops will, by and large, \"be welcomed,\" Cagaptay says. He doesn\u2019t expect the YPG to confront them head-on at the border.\n\n\"So Turkey will drive a wedge into the YPG\u2019s territory and make that wedge solidly Arab,\" in part by repatriating refugees, Cagaptay says.\n\nBut, but, but: \"Although I don\u2019t expect a war of epic proportions, things could always go wrong.\"\n\n\"There is always the risk of civilian casualties and collateral damage,\" he says.\n\n\"And I think if Turkey goes maximalist and expands its reach into solidly Kurdish areas, then it will face an insurgency.\"\n\nWhat to watch\n\nErdogan expects little international pushback for his Syria offensive, Cagaptay says. And as anger grows in Washington, he continues to rely heavily on his personal relationship with Trump.\n\n\u201cBut a relationship that hinges on personalities, Erdogan and Trump, will face long-term risks,\u201d Cagaptay says.\n\n\u201cYou need agencies to trust each other again. You need bureaucracies to have faith in each other. And faith between the militaries has already been undermined.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: \"On a day-to-day basis, I wonder if one of these crises that\u2019s coming up will actually rupture the relationship.\"", "description": "An interview with U.S.-Turkey expert Soner Cagaptay, author of the new book \"Erdogan\u2019s Empire.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/1g_YRJsNFJSlqt8Ppwumv6rqpCg=/0x0:3000x1688/1920x1080/2019/10/09/1570654298359.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
