But astronomers recently discovered that some of these galaxies were kidnapped from neighboring large dwarf galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud, so called because it appears like a faint cloud, is also on a collision course with our galaxy.\n\nThe LMC is fairly new to orbiting the Milky Way, entering our corner of the universe 1.5 billion years ago. It's now the brightest satellite galaxy we have, 163,000 light-years from the Milky Way. Previously, astronomers thought it would hang out in a quiet, long orbit or speed away from the gravity of the Milky Way and move on.\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud will catastrophically collide with the Milky Way in 2 billion years, according to a study published January in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The impact, which they believe is long overdue, has a chance of sending our solar system \"hurtling through space.\"\n\nNow, researchers using the Gaia space telescope realized that four ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, as well as two bright galaxies called Carina and Fornax, once belonged to the LMC.\n\nRead More", "description": "Our large galaxy, the Milky Way, is orbited by more than 50 other, smaller galaxies.
