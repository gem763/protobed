Murray warned Fognini to \u201cshut up\u201d and complained repeatedly to umpire Fergus Murphy before eventually going down to a 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 defeat.\n\nMurray thus left the Shanghai Open in a state of high dudgeon. Not only had he wasted two opportunities to serve the match out \u2013 something he later suggested had never happened before in his career \u2013 but he also felt that Fognini had treated him disrespectfully on the court.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe initial flashpoint came at 5-5 in the third set, when Murray darted forward to the net and steered a straightforward volley into the open court for a winner. Fognini shouted as Murray struck the ball \u2013 perhaps in frustration \u2013 but Murray later suggested that the point should have been handed to him via the hindrance rule.\n\n\u201cI looked in the direction of where the noise came from,\u201d Murray later explained. \u201cHe then told me, \u2018Stop looking at me. What are you looking at me for?\u2019 I was, like, \u2018Well, I was just about to hit a shot and someone made a noise.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe told me to stop complaining, to have a sense of humour, that, \u2018When you have a volley on top of the net, you know you\u2019re not going to miss it.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I know I\u2019m not going to miss it, but I wanted to know where the noise came from.\u2019 It came from him, which you\u2019re not allowed to do. It\u2019s against the rules. It\u2019s hindrance. I would say in that moment, neither of us were in a joking or laughing kind of mood.\u201d\n\nMurray repeatedly complained to the umpire Credit: Getty images\n\nStory continues\n\nWith regard to Murphy, who kept a low profile throughout the exchange, Murray explained \u201cHe [Murphy] wasn\u2019t saying anything to him [Fognini], so I was just obviously frustrated with that. Fabio wanted to engage with me and I probably shouldn\u2019t have done. But I\u2019m not having him talk to me like that on the court.\u201d\n\nMurray stood two points from victory on a couple of occasions but couldn\u2019t find the big serves when he needed them \u2013 a symptom, perhaps, of the fact that this was only the 12th match he has played since he had a metal ball-and-socket joint implanted in his right hip in January. This was always going to be a difficult match, for Fognini is the world No 12, a player who can conjure magical shots from almost any position. Their head-to-head record now stands at four wins apiece.\n\nMurray left the court quickly after the most brief and chilly of handshakes. In the interview room, he emphasised that there were many areas of his game that he can improve \u2013 and added ominously that expects to be \u201cin a better position next time I play against him.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, the Australian Open\u2019s tournament director Craig Tiley had told a local radio station that \u201cAndy will be here [in January].\u201d This was hardly a surprise, however, given that Murray had spoken publicly about how \u201cpumped\u201d he will be to play in Melbourne only last month. Murray\u2019s next on-court appointment is expected to come at the European Open in Antwerp next week.\n\nMeanwhile, Dan Evans is guaranteed to become British No 1 on Monday following Cameron Norrie\u2019s 6-3, 6-1 defeat at the hands of world No. 4 Daniil Medvedev in Shanghai. Evans is the world No 43.", "description": "Andy Murray\u2019s 3hr 10min battle with Fabio Fognini became so heated on Tuesday that it spilled over into verbal confrontation.
