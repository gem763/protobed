No single device, ingredient or additive has been identified, though many cases involve marijuana vaping devices.\n\nThe proposal announced by Trump officials would only apply to nicotine vaping products, which are regulated by the FDA. The FDA has had the authority to ban vaping flavours since 2016, but has previously resisted calls to take that step.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Children have died, people have died. And we\u2019re going to have some very strong rules and regulations.\u201d\n\nReports suggest that any ban on flavoured products would be a major blow to the vaping industry, including companies such as Juul, which has grown into a multibillion dollar business by selling mint, fruit and dessert flavoured-products.\n\nJuul and other vaping companies argue that their products are intended to help adult smokers wean themselves off traditional paper-and-tobacco cigarettes.\n\nA few local governments, including San Francisco, have passed bans on flavoured tobacco. This month Michigan moved to become the first state to ban flavoured electronic cigarettes.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "Donald Trump has said he plans to ban flavoured e-cigarettes after a spate of vaping deaths, declaring that companies were getting rich as people died.
