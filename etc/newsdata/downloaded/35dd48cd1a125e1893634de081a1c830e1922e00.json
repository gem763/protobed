The judge said the company had run a \u201cfalse and dangerous\u201d marketing campaign that perpetuated the crisis in the state. The landmark ruling is the first time a drug manufacturer has been held legally responsible for contributing to the opioid epidemic.\n\nThat decision may soon be followed by a massive settlement involving OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma. The company has reportedly offered $10 billion to $12 billion to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits alleging it helped start and perpetuate the crisis.\n\nPrescription opioids have caused more than 200,000 deaths in the past two decades. The cause is often linked to overprescription of pain medication. America's biggest drug companies distributed 76 billion opioid pills between 2006 and 2012.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nThe ruling in Oklahoma and the potential Purdue Pharma settlement are seen by many as a form of justice against companies that flooded communities with potentially deadly drugs in a blind pursuit of profit. \u201cA reckoning is finally taking shape,\u201d one of the witnesses in the Oklahoma case said. The hope is that fear of financial retribution will push drug manufacturers to be more responsible in their practices.\n\nSome have argued, however, that the payments aren\u2019t large enough to offset the massive profits drug companies made from selling opioids. Others say the deals allow executives to escape personal repercussions for what the companies did on their behalf. There is also some skepticism over whether the legal reasoning used in the Oklahoma case will hold up under appeal or be applicable in other jurisdictions.\n\nOthers have defended the manufacturers, saying the companies are being unfairly blamed for the epidemic when the behavior of doctors, legislators, insurance companies and patients are also major drivers of the crisis. \u201cYou can\u2019t sue your way out of the opioid crisis,\u201d an attorney for Johnson & Johnson said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nThe Oklahoma decision may face an appeal in the near future. But if the ruling is allowed to stand, it could be used as a guide for future cases against a number of other opioid manufacturers in the United States. A consolidated case combining many of the 2,000 lawsuits against Purdue Pharma is scheduled to start in late October if a settlement agreement isn't reached.\n\nRegardless of how the legal aspects play out, there is reason for cautious optimism that efforts to fight opioid epidemic may be working. After increasing steadily for decades, U.S. drug overdose deaths declined in 2018.\n\nPerspectives\n\nThe cases could be the start of drug companies being held accountable for their actions.\n\n\u201cThe pharmaceutical industry faces a possible reckoning like that which Big Tobacco once faced \u2014 and for a public-health catastrophe as devastating, in its own way, as the one smoking wrought.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, Washington Post\n\nThe penalties aren\u2019t big enough to change the behavior of drug companies.\n\n\u201cThe job of the courts and regulatory apparatus is to help prevent future disaster. This will not happen when penalties are meted out such that loss of life is treated as a cost of doing business.\u201d \u2014 James Hamblin, The Atlantic\n\nPayments by drug companies are only part of a solution to the epidemic.\n\n\u201cHolding the pharmaceutical companies that profited off of addiction and pain to account is important and has inherent value. However, efforts to respond to the crisis should continue in parallel to legal action. Any funds that might come from litigation would be a bonus \u2014 not the solution itself.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nThe cases provide the first positive sign in the campaign to halt the crisis.\n\n\u201cFor those fighting on the front lines of the opioid epidemic, they represent the first inklings of hope in a very long time.\u201d \u2014 Mac Molinaro, New York Daily News\n\nOnly criminal punishment for executives will be strong enough to create change.\n\n\u201cCash settlements are a start, but they will never be enough. The executives who masterminded the drug epidemic should face consequences for their greed.\u201d \u2014 Ryan Hampton, Los Angeles Magazine", "description": "Drug manufacturers could face billions of dollars in penalties for their role in opioid crisis.
