(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe vast majority of Americans are not surprised that President Trump encouraged the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son, and fewer than half see it as a \u201cvery serious\u201d problem, an ABC News-Ipsos poll released Sunday indicates.\n\nJust about half of Americans said they are \u201cnot surprised at all\u201d to hear of Trump\u2019s actions. An additional 32 percent said they are \u201cnot surprised.\u201d\n\nThe national poll, conducted Friday and Saturday, also finds that 63 percent of adults say it is a serious problem that Trump pushed the president of Ukraine to investigate the son of his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden in a July call that has sparked an extraordinary whistleblower complaint and led Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry. Less than half of the public, 43 percent, said Trump\u2019s action was \u201cvery serious.\u201d\n\nThe survey did not ask whether Trump should be impeached or about accusations that White House officials tried to keep the July phone call secret, a claim laid out by an unidentified whistleblower in a seven-page complaint released Thursday.\n\nSeveral reaction polls released in the past week found an uptick in the percentage of Americans in favor of impeachment. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist survey found 49 percent approval for impeachment and 46 percent against. After the release of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report on Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and throughout the summer, most polls showed majorities opposing impeachment.\n\nHouse Democrats are gambling that more of the public will support their decision to move ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry as the investigation progresses. Until this week, about half of Democratic caucus members wanted to launch impeachment proceedings. By Friday, all but 11 were on board.\n\nDespite the Ukraine story dominating headlines, just about one-quarter of adults say they have followed the news \u201cvery closely.\" More than 6 in 10 say they are following the issue at least \u201csomewhat closely.\u201d\n\nThe survey was conducted Sept. 27-28 using Ipsos\u2019 Knowledge Panel, an ongoing survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.", "description": "", "authors": ["Scott Clement", "Polling Director", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aCQjDeNyp8zIahR55rvx0Rs6v6A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PXIM7VXCAYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
