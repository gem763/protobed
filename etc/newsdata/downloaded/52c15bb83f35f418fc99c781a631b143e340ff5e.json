Sort of makes sense, seeing as the 22-year-old is a billionaire cosmetics entrepreneur and knows a thing or two about contouring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two were getting ready in the bathroom of Kris Jenner\u2019s holiday home, where the family had gathered to ring in another spin around the year for Kim.\n\nKylie did Kim\u2019s make-up (Picture: Kim Kardashian / Instagram)\n\nThe table decorations were something else (Picture: Instagram/kimkardashian)\n\nIt IS all about you, Kimberly (Picture: Kim Kardashian / Instagram)\n\nUnfortunately Kris wasn\u2019t at the party (due to being at Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s wedding), held at her sprawling seven-bedroom home in La Quinta, near Palm Springs, but that didn\u2019t stop her kids from taking over the abode.\n\nAppropriately dubbed \u2018Kim day\u2019, Kim then showed us the table adorned with a whole heap of party accoutrements to make it special for those toasting.\n\nFrom party hats to sunglasses, necklaces and confetti, it was the birthday of dreams.\n\nKim is the birthday babe (Picture: Kim Kardashian / Instagram)\n\nPink and peach was the theme (Picture: Kim Kardashian / Instagram)\n\nThere was no mistaking whose birthday it was (Picture: Kim Kardashian / Instagram)\n\nShowing everyone who the real megastar was, Kim\u2019s party hat read \u2018birthday princess\u2019 and rightly so, taking pride of place next to a necklace that sported \u2018birthday babe\u2019 and a broach that let everyone know \u2018today is all about you\u2019.\n\nAlright, Kim, we get it \u2013 today is your day.\n\nNumerous peach balloons sat in bundles on the table with pink streamers fitting in the colour theme of the evening.\n\nAfterwards it seemed the family gathered together for a good, old-fashioned board game night \u2013 with a twist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we can only wish to have been a fly on the wall, Kim revealed her partygoers took in a game of Cards Against Humanity \u2013 a rather naughty time-passer.\n\nHappy birthday to Kim (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nKim\u2019s husband Kanye West and their four children, North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm weren\u2019t to be seen in the nighttime snaps, but they were never far from her thoughts over the weekend after the reality star shared a pretty cute snap of her husband sleeping on Friday.\n\nIt followed a pretty important trip for Kim when she got baptised along with three of the kids in a traditional ceremony in Armenia. North was baptised in Jerusalem in 2015.\n\nWhat a week for Kim, eh?\n\nHappy birthday!\n\nGot a showbiz story?
