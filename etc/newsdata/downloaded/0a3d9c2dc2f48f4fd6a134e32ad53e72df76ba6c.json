REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nDENVER (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the Federal Reserve has been largely ignored by investors, an apparent vote of confidence in the central bank\u2019s ability to slough off the president\u2019s insults and make independent decisions, economists at Goldman Sachs found in a new study.\n\nBut his tweets about trade appear to strike home, and have caused markets to slice roughly half a percentage point from their expectations about where the Fed would set its target policy rate, Goldman economist Ronnie Walker found.\n\n\u201cMarkets believe the president primarily affects Fed policy indirectly by influencing the macroeconomic outlook, with at most a limited perceived role for tweets about the Fed,\u201d Walker wrote.\n\nIt is a conclusion roughly in line with what the Fed says about itself. Policymakers say that Trump is free to speak his mind - including calling them \u201cboneheads\u201d for not cutting interest rates - but that they base their rate decisions on the economic outlook.\n\nHowever the trade tweets, including market-rattling statements about ordering U.S. companies out of China, have been associated with policy steps that have raised economic risks and prompted the Fed to act. It has so far cut rates by half a percentage point this year, roughly in line with the change in the market outlook Walker found in his research.\n\nThe research looked at the change in market expectations about the federal funds rate a half an hour after Trump tweets. In the case of tweets directed at the Fed, those expectations have fallen by a total of about 0.1 percentage point.\n\nThat\u2019s consistent with an earlier academic study that concluded Trump was influencing the Fed. But Walker noted that the impact was not statistically significant when compared with moves in the federal funds rate on days when Trump did not tweet.\n\n\u201cStatistically, the moves in the fed funds futures market following such tweets are not significantly different from those in any given market interval,\u201d Walker wrote. By contrast, \u201cthe evidence that President Trump\u2019s trade-related tweets affect market expectations of Fed policy is strong.\u201d\n\nA Reuters poll of economists earlier this year found that 80% felt Trump\u2019s tweets did not influence the Fed. A poll of individuals found his tweets had little impact on the public\u2019s view of the central bank or the value of its independence in setting monetary policy.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve has been largely ignored by investors, an apparent vote of confidence in the central bank's ability to slough off the president's insults and make independent decisions, economists at Goldman Sachs found in a new study.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438492614&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9717T", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
