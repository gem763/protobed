Now we have the same kind of interaction through our media. You go from the new launch at Selfridges and the next day there\u2019s someone dying,\u201d he said after the show in a rarely seen courtyard at the Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nDespite that bleak starting point, his show was full of optimistic, even dreamy colors cut in relaxed silhouettes, with lots of shimmering sequins.\n\nThe designer, who made his name with the figure-hugging Galaxy dress he debuted in 2005, and which is still in production today, sent out a collection that nodded to the \u201880s via soft tailoring (a revolutionary concept led by Giorgio Armani and made famous by Richard Gere in \u201cAmerican Gigolo\u201d), wide shoulders and relaxed American sportswear staples. Those were reframed by Mouret as a low-slung blue sequin skirt worn with a white blouse and a rope belt that looked like it was filched from the nearest yacht.\n\nThe wolves of Wall Street were alluded to through the corporate appeal of checked suits, the double-pleated fronts on gorgeously fluid wide-legged trousers and stock broker-approved wide lapels that were deployed across jackets and coats. The motif especially stood out on an oyster sequin blazer with a contrasting blue lapel, which was teamed with a blush pink sequin skirt and a white bohemian blouse.\n\nSIMONE ROCHA SHOWS SERENE, OFFBEAT COLLECTION\n\nSimone Rocha continues to impress and draw new admirers as her collections grow in sophistication without sacrificing the look that has made her unique. Her color palette is simple: white and blue, white and red, white and black, but the embroidery and layering are remarkable.\n\nThe models\u2019 hair seemed sculptural, adding texture and depth to the outfits, as did the elaborate braided straps to some of the handbags, which were similar to detailing on various outfits.\n\nRocha also is improving her staging. With her designer father, John Rocha, watching from the front row, the show unspooled with a certain dignity and serenity, the models walking slowly in a circle on the stage of the Alexandra Palace, a 19th century landmark in north London.\n\nRocha continued what has become her tradition: employing some older models and some who were not rail-thin. Some of the models also broke with tradition by smiling at the audience, and one blew a kiss to a friend near the end of the show. It added to the celebratory feel.\n\nSTILL BUZZING ABOUT NAOMI CAMPBELL\u2019S GALA\n\nMuch of the buzz Sunday focused on the success of Naomi Campbell\u2019s Fashion for Relief gala the night before, which continued for hours after the late-night show with a dinner in the heart of the British Museum.\n\nCampbell has become a master at organizing big, complex events for her charity efforts, and this was no exception. She managed to procure one of the most prestigious sites in London and filled it with a glamorous crowd.\n\nShe even returned to the runway, proving without a doubt she can still model any time she chooses.\n\nEMILIA WICKSTEAD PAYS TRIBUTE TO LOUISA MAY ALCOTT\n\nEmilia Wickstead paid homage to Louisa May Alcott\u2019s classic novel \u201cLittle Women\u201d for spring 2020, a timely reference given an upcoming film directed by Greta Gerwig which stars Emma Watson as Meg and Saorise Ronan as the headstrong Jo March.\n\nDebussy\u2019s soothing \u201cArabesque No. 1. Andantino con moto\u201d played as Wickstead\u2019s guests climbed the stairs to the nosebleed section of the Royal Albert Hall, setting the tone for an elegant collection that ran the gamut from poised sophistication to joyful exuberance and sensual femininity.\n\nThere was a focus on volume, with bunches of fabric at the back of dresses echoing the bustles prevalent in Alcott\u2019s time.\n\nOne jumpsuit had a crisp collar and midriff cutout placed to accentuate a high waistband. Another dress had wide cuffed sleeves and panels reminiscent of 19th century shirt bibs.\n\nThe palette of saccharine pinks, yellows, lavender, and tangerine was sharpened by no-nonsense red and black, while a print offering was comprised of delicate hand-painted blue roses imposed on a mint color.\n\nHats, a big motif in the novel, were used to dramatic effect, especially one wide black visor-like piece that was perched and worn with a slim cap-sleeved black dress with a sternum-exposing cut-out.\n\nOther moments of high drama appeared via a billowing cloud of black organza, fashioned into a balloon-sleeved gown. The closing look elicited raised eyebrows and naked admiration in equal measure: a full-length pink gown with copious bunches that could best be described as a boat-necked marshmallow.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Fashion devotees basked in sunny weather and strong, sometimes whimsical collections as London Fashion Week neared its climax Sunday with runway shows by Roland Mouret, Victoria Beckham, Simone Rocha and others throughout the city.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gregory Katz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/britain_london_fashion_s_s_2020_preen_93310_c0-147-3500-2187_s1770x1032.jpg?9f0ec6102a60103340cada258795c99dcb54d28c", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
