He said the\n\nblock had been undeveloped for nearly 25 years since the\n\nexecution of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a prominent writer who was among\n\nnine protest leaders executed in 1995 by the then military\n\ngovernment of Sani Abacha.\n\nShell, whose Nigerian subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development\n\nCompany (SPDC) jointly owns the licence with the Nigerian\n\nNational Petroleum Company, declined to confirm or deny the\n\nsale.\n\n\"The announcement by the Rivers state government is in\n\nrespect of the assets of SPDC which form part of a matter that\n\nis pending in court, for which reason we are unable to make\n\nfurther comment,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe Department of Petroleum Resources, the government\n\ndepartment that would approve any transfer of an oil licence,\n\nsaid it was not aware of any sale of OML 11.\n\nThere are various legal cases involving SPDC and community\n\nrepresentatives in Ogoniland, including efforts by some to seize\n\nSPDC assets to cover debts related to oil spills.\n\nIndustry sources have said the field is among several\n\nonshore assets that Shell has been trying to sell in Nigeria.\n\nWike said Rivers state had bid $150 million for the 45%\n\nstake in the asset.\n\nThe governor's statement said OML 11 had the potential to\n\nproduce 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil.
