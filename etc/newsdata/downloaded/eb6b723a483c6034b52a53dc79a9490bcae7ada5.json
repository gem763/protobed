He used the word \u2018demand\u2019 \u2013 \u2018I demand of you that you do certain things\u2019. It was volatile, it was aggressive.\n\n\u2018I had never had a meeting like that before in 26 years of teaching. He set up a WhatsApp group that afternoon\u2026 trying to whip up a frenzy.\u2019\n\nAsked if she thought some protesters were \u2018potential rowdies\u2019 seeking a free-for-all, the head teacher said: \u2018I don\u2019t mind staunch objections but what I do mind is aggressive behaviour. I am not going to invite that kind of behaviour, when I don\u2019t need to, into my school halls.\u2019\n\nAnderton Park head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson outside the Priory Law Courts in Birmingham (Picture:PA)\n\nThe school was teaching equality, but was not promoting homosexuality, said Mrs Hewitt-Clarkson, who agreed with the protesters\u2019 barrister that some Muslims would feel \u2018a tension\u2019 between the books and their religion.\n\nBut she added: \u2018For many Muslims in our school and our staff there is not a tension. The protesters were only ever a small number.\u2019\n\nShe told the court some male protesters had turned up wearing balaclavas and others handed out leaflets, something she described as \u2018unprecedented\u2019 and \u2018awful\u2019.\n\nThe court heard a claim that concerns had been raised by one parent about a book featuring two male penguins looking after an egg, while Mr Afsar was said to have asked for a list of the literature being used.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring more than two hours of testimony, Mrs Hewitt-Clarkson said there were demands to keep some books locked in a cabinet which she thought was \u2018the opposite of what equality is all about. It would make school segregated.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the opposite of what education is about. It\u2019s the opposite of what this country is about.\n\nProtestors demonstrating after injunction was granted barring action immediately outside Anderton Park Primary School (Picture: PA Wire)\n\n\u2018Many of the protesters didn\u2019t come to the meetings that we held. I never went out to the protesters \u2013 I just observed through my office or saw later on social media.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s quite hard to have a dialogue when people are chanting, \u2018Head teacher, step down\u2019 and \u2018Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson is a liar\u2019.\u2019\n\nBirmingham City Council\u2019s director for neighbourhoods Robert James said the injunction was a response to protesters\u2019 \u2018behaviour\u2019 causing harm and distress, and safety concerns, including for road users.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not about the issue of the protest, it\u2019s the manner in which they were conducted,\u2019 he told the court.\n\nThe hearing continues on Tuesday.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
