Ahead of the show, City Press spoke with Masgesh Ndaba.\n\nThe friendly icon of spinning said: \u201cThe sport of spinning has grown through the support of the people in the kasi. We hardly get sponsored other than opportunities like this. This sport is a very expensive one.\u201d\n\nThis high octane pass time is of course quite a dangerous one too.\n\nNdaba explained: \u201cSafety is our number one priority, we take it very seriously. Should one lose control of a car, lots of people would be injured. We always use a barricaded area, fenced, with fire marshals around as a car is not a play thing.\u201d\n\nNdaba said to look out for Off Spinz, Maskopasi and Bad Company in particular at the event.\n\nThere will be a whole host of crews looking to showcase their talent on the day.\n\nNdaba suggested for all those who have never encountered this sport and are looking to attend on the day.\n\n\u201cThe one thing you should focus on is how the spinning is done. The technique, the driving style. We all do the same thing but the difference is in the approach.\u201d\n\nHe offered advice to the crews who will dual it out next weekend.\n\n\u201cIn order to win you have to give it your best. Spin like there is no tomorrow and no holing back, do all the stunts you know, hit a combo and leave it all out on the pitch.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to be hopeful about the future of this controversial but nonetheless, rising activity.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a lot of youngsters venturing into the sport. They will be the ones to watch as we want them to carry it forward. We are grooming them to be better than us and get what we couldn\u2019t. It would be wrong not to pass the knowledge on.\u201d", "description": "The sport of spinning has grown in leaps and bounds from its shady beginnings as a hobby for hoodlums.", "authors": ["Phumalani S Langa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9470/7c5977c8d48e46f2aa75662ba9d30385.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
