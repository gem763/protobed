These included not just the vice president for protecting the European way of life but also a vice president for an economy that works for people.\n\nThe migration proposal, however, was the one that proved controversial. And some leaders in Parliament warned von der Leyen on Wednesday that she should change the title or gave the prospect of the Parliament doing it for her. (All Commission nominees are subject to confirmation by Parliament).\n\n\u201cWe think about all the arguments, but there\u2019s for sure no quick decision,\u201d von der Leyen\u2019s spokesman said.\n\nHe noted that the future commissioners were gathered Wednesday evening outside of Brussels for a retreat and seminar on the future of the EU \u201cincluding bold topics like climate change, digitalization, strong Europe in the world, etc.\u201d\n\nAnd presumably, though he didn\u2019t say it, the European way of life.", "description": "Name of Margaritis Schinas\u2019 portfolio has MEPs fuming.", "authors": ["David M.
