Until I win another tournament my confidence probably won\u2019t come back.\n\nSelby lifting the China Open trophy in 2018 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve started off the season okay, I\u2019m still searching for my best form, I\u2019m playing okay in patches but it\u2019s just not consistent. I\u2019m playing a good game, then a poor game, then a good game, so it\u2019s just a matter of riding the wave and hopefully it will turn around sooner or later. Keep putting the hard work in, that\u2019s all I can do.\u2019\n\nThe vagaries of form are such that it is very difficult to pin down why good results come and go, Selby is certainly none the wiser.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Selby admitted. \u2018I performed so well for a period of time, at some point, the law of averages you were always going to have a little dip. Obviously this seems to be my dip.\n\n\u2018You look at John Higgins. One of the greats of the game, he went through a stage where he went missing for a while. It doesn\u2019t make him any worse of a player.\n\n\u2018Form comes and goes. Form is temporary, class is permanent. I believe that. My form at the moment hasn\u2019t been great but that it isn\u2019t down not to putting work in. I am trying to rectify that and have a good run.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelby has won three of the last six World Championships and dominated the world rankings for much of that time, holding the number one spot from February 2014 until dropping down in March 2019.\n\nA cost of his slump in form is that Selby has relinquished that position, but he is determined to reclaim it from current world champion Judd Trump.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s one of my goals [to get back to number one]. With what I have achieved in the game, you have to still keep setting goals,\u2019 continued Selby.\n\n\u2018I have always done since the start of my career. So one of my goals is to get back to world number one.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t going to stay there forever. I stayed there for four years over seven seasons, to stay there as long as I was unbelievable.\n\n\u2018Now I am not there, it released a bit of pressure. The pressure is on everyone else, the expectations are more on Judd. It is still at the back of my mind to get it back and something to work on.\u2019\n\nSelby takes on Alexander Ursenbacher or Martin O\u2019Donnell in the English Open second round on Wednesday as he looks to claim a Home Nations title for the first time.\n\nMORE: Judd Trump tells Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan to stop moaning as English Open criticism continues\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan reignites attack on English Open: \u2018Every day in Crawley is a day lost in my life\u2019", "description": "Mark Selby is battling his opponents and his own lofty expectations as he looks to win his first title in over a year this week at the English Open.
