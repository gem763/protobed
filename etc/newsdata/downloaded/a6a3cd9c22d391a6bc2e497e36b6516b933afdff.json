It offers one-day free delivery, as well as access to music, books and video streaming. It is often available with a free 30-day trial.\n\nThe page in question, seen in May and June 2019, included a gold box stating: \"Order now with Prime.\" Directly beneath that, in a grey box, text stated: \"Continue with free one-day delivery - pay later.\" Both these options signed users up to Prime.\n\nIn its ruling, the ASA said the presentation and wording of the two boxes had been \"likely to be seen by the average consumer as separate options\".\n\nThe option to not join Prime at all had been presented on the left-hand side of the page, had been smaller and \"could easily be missed by consumers,\" it said.\n\n\"It was also in a faint colour - and compared to the option presented in the grey and gold boxes, it was significantly less prominent,\" the ruling said.\n\nFree trial\n\n\"We considered that the average consumer was likely to view the text within the grey and gold boxes as the only two options available, with the 'option' in the grey box allowing them to continue without signing up to Prime, when that was not the case.\"\n\nSmall print at the bottom of the page informed customers that after a 30-day free trial, they would be signed up to Amazon Prime.\n\nIn its response to the ASA, Amazon said it had periodically adjusted the way it had presented the two options on the page and used \"customer satisfaction data to inform such adjustments and identify potential issues\".\n\nThe retail giant said its primary objective was to make sure consumers who joined Prime did so intentionally and became active members who would make the most of the benefits of the subscription service.", "description": "The way payment options were presented was confusing and needs to change, the advertising watchdog rules.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2323/production/_109459980_amazonprime.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
