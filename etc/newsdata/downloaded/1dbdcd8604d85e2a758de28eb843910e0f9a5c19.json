The committee includes 16 government agencies, including the military and the national police, along with private entities like the Association of Hotels and Tourism of the Dominican Republic (ASONAHORES).\n\n\u201cTourism in the Dominican Republic is a model for development (of the industry),\u201d Garcia said through a translator. \u201cMore than 50 years of hard work, we have the best installations in the Caribbean \u2014 the best infrastructure in the Caribbean region.\u201d\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC RESORT WHERE US WOMAN CLAIMED ASSAULT TO CLOSE TEMPORARILY DUE TO LOW OCCUPANCY\n\nThe minister said they also have reinforced rules that now require emergency information and the 911 number be clearly posted in every guest room.\n\nThe island\u2019s safety came under scrutiny earlier this year after Tammy Lawrence-Daley of Delaware claimed she was assaulted by a hotel employee at the all-inclusive luxury resort Majestic Elegance in Punta Cana. Her claims were amplified after the deaths of at least nine American tourists in the weeks that followed at various hotels across the country.\n\nGarcia denounced what he called the \u201cbombardment\u201d of news about the so-called \u201cmysterious deaths,\u201d steadfastly saying that in fact, none of the deaths were related and all the tourists died of natural causes.\n\n\u201cThe bombardment that we had from the media could be a product of a book,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unlike the bombs that were dropped in Germany (during World War II), is that the Dominican Republic is not at war. We are not in a state of war.\u201d\n\nGarcia added: \u201cWe have worked very hard to stop this and there has been a process of clarifying all the information that was needed. But the damage has been done. \u2026 What happened in the Dominican Republic today, this could happen to another country tomorrow. Or to a region or the entire tourism sector.\u201d\n\nDOMINICAN HEALTH MINISTER SAYS DRUGS, ALCOHOL, MEDICAL PROBLEMS MAY HAVE KILLED US COUPLE; LAWYER CALLS IT 'LUDICROUS'\n\nAutopsies showed the tourists died of natural causes, but two of the cases are receiving further toxicology analysis with help from the FBI. Those results have not been released, but Garcia told reporters that they are confident the results will match those conducted by Dominican authorities.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has discounted the idea of a surge of tourist deaths, saying it had not seen an uptick in the number of U.S. citizens who died in the Dominican Republic.\n\nRobin Bernstein, the U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic, said the news reports on the deaths were an \u201cunfounded negative campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cI implore you, the responsible journalists, to tell the truth about these issues,\u201d she said at the event, adding that the deaths were all \u201cunrelated.\u201d\n\nDOMINICAN TOURISM OFFICIAL VOWS 'DISCIPLINARY ACTION' IF US TOURIST PRODE FINDS NEGLIGENCE\n\n\u201c(My family), we have been traveling all around the Dominican Republic and I can tell you that never was there a point that I thought my life was unsafe,\u201d she added.\n\nGarcia did not provide specifics when asked whether there has been a drop in tourist arrivals since the wave of negative news.\n\n\u201cWe will calculate that at the end of the year. June and July were abnormal months because they were affected by information that was taken out of context,\u201d he told reporters after the event.\n\nFox News reported in late June that flight bookings to the island had reportedly gone down 74 percent ahead of the end of the summer season.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlex Zozaya, the executive chairman for Apple Leisure Group, said at the event that the Dominican Republic is a \u201cbenchmark\u201d for other destinations in the region and that the practices conducted there are being taken to other countries to bolster their infrastructure.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The Dominican minister of tourism touted new safety measures that been put in place after the public relations nightmare that erupted over the summer following the deaths of at least 9 American tourists at hotels in the Caribbean destination.", "authors": ["Lucia Suarez Sang"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19256020545826.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
