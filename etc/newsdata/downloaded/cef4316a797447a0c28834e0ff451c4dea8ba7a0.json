First deployed in the late summer of 2018, Kaspersky said the most recent samples have been seen active as recent as this month, September 2019.\n\nRecent DTrack samples can perform the following operations:\n\nKeylogging,\n\nRetrieve browser history,\n\nGather host IP addresses, information about available networks and active connections,\n\nList running processes,\n\nList files on all available disk volumes.\n\nBased on currently available information, it is unclear if DTrack evolved from ATMDTrack, or if ATMDTrack was developed from the main DTrack strain when North Korean hackers managed to breach Indian backs last year and needed a specialized tool to target ATMs.", "description": "Another version of the same malware, but with RAT-like features, spotted targeting Indian research centers.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/05/6c5b47ca-a652-4889-ade3-d4d67d16a801/thumbnail/770x578/3169c75beac0d98e97931cd45c432b68/screenshot-2019-06-05-at-13-36-55.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
