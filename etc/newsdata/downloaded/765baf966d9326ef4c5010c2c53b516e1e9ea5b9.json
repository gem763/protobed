REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nJust days before the United Kingdom is formally due to leave the EU on Oct. 31 at 2300 GMT, Brexit is hanging in the balance as British politicians are no closer to reaching a consensus on how, when or even if the divorce should take place.\n\nJohnson, who became prime minister in July by pledging, \u201cdo or die\u201d, to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31, was compelled to request a postponement after he was defeated in parliament over the sequencing of the ratification of his divorce deal.\n\nThe 27 countries that will remain in the EU after Brexit agreed on Monday to put off Brexit until the end of January with an earlier departure possible should the faction-ridden UK parliament ratify their separation deal.\n\n\u201cThe EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK\u2019s request for a Brexit \u2018flextension\u2019 until 31 January 2020,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk said in a tweet, referring to the idea of a \u201cflexible extension\u201d.\n\nEU member states will need Britain to formally reply to its offer of a 3-month delay before launching a \u201cwritten procedure\u201d whereby governments will have 24 hours to accept or reject.\n\n\u201cWe can only launch the written procedure when we have the agreement of the UK government on the text,\u201d a senior EU official said. Johnson is obliged by legislation passed by parliament last month to accept an extension once offered.\n\nJohnson will respond to the EU\u2019s delay offer once he has reviewed the details, his spokesman said on Monday.\n\nTwo senior EU diplomats confirmed that the written procedure period agreed was 24 hours, effective from the time London accepts the offer of a Brexit delay from Oct. 31 to Jan. 31.\n\nBritain\u2019s departure has already been delayed twice - from March 29 and April 12 - after Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get her deal ratified by parliament.\n\nWith British politics still paralysed over carrying out Brexit 3-1/2 years after a 52%-48% referendum vote in favour of Leave, Johnson is demanding parliament approve an election on Dec. 12 in return for more time to adopt his deal.\n\nBut he needs the support of two-thirds of the 650 lawmakers for a new election. A House of Commons vote was due later on Monday.\n\n\u201cFLEXTENSION\u201d\n\nThe EU, forged from the ruins of World War Two as a way to prevent another devastating conflict in Europe, is fatigued by Britain\u2019s Brexit crisis but keen not to be held responsible for an economically tumultuous \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had been the main hurdle to an extension, arguing there had to be a good reason for a delay and that the British needed to break their own political deadlock. But a source close to Macron said the prospect of an election in Britain had strengthened significantly.\n\nThe source stressed that the third Brexit delay would come with conditions, including a refusal to renegotiate the divorce agreement and giving a green light to other EU countries to meet without Britain to discuss the bloc\u2019s future.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Council President Donald Tusk looks on during a joint news conference with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the end of the European Union leaders summit dominated by Brexit, in Brussels, Belgium October 18, 2019.

Even though the United Kingdom is set to leave, it will have a legal obligation to nominate a new commissioner for the EU\u2019s powerful executive body.\n\nThe latest delay plan envisages that Britain could be out on Dec. 1 or Jan. 1 should parliament ratify the agreement in November or December, respectively, according to diplomats who deal with Brexit in Brussels.\n\nThe EU will state that the extension, the third granted so Britain can sort out the details of its departure, will not be used to renegotiate the divorce treaty again, and that London should not impede other essential work by the EU on projects ranging from budgets to climate policies.", "description": "The European Union on Monday agreed a 3-month flexible delay to Britain's departure from the bloc as Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushes for an election after opponents forced him to request an extension he had vowed never to ask for.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445847157&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0N8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
