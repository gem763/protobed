By all means sparkle, but do so discreetly.\"\n\nIt is officially Day One of South African fashion Week (SAFW) and we're already on the edge of our front row seats with bated breath over which luxury collection will wow us this season.\n\nTaking place at the Protea Court Rooftop at Sandton City from 23 - 26 October, the local fashion community can look forward to 30 luxury labels showcasing their Autumn/Winter 2020 collections and 80 trade show exhibitors over the next few days.\n\nREAD MORE: Essential Spring/Summer trends every South African woman should have in her wardrobe, according to this international fashion authority\n\nSo without further ado, here's the ultimate guide to ensuring you enjoy your best Fashion Week yet this season:\n\nSupplied by South African Fashion Week.\n\nIn addition to this, SAFW reiterates that \"stylish [yet] considerate is the millennial way,\" adding that attendees ought to be mindful of not obscuring anyone's view or talking during the show.\n\nPerhaps they've taken note of previous and continuous critique of South Africa's fashion week culture of forgetting that the runway is the main course and the street style of attendees merely the garnish - both in terms of reporting and consuming the weeks' sartorial offering.\n\nOf course, both are worth their respective nods, but it's time eyes shifted their disproportionate focus from 'who was there' to 'who was showing'.\n\nWith that said, it's also worth mentioning again that SAFW recently announced that it has committed itself to a five-year plan to spearhead the development of an ecologically-based and sustainable local design culture by 2025.\n\nAccording to Lucilla Booyzen, director of the country\u2019s premier platform for South African design (SAFW), which is now in its 22nd year, the immediate goal is to initiate a process of collaboration and joint problem-solving with the designer community and the broader clothing industry behind the vision of establishing a local fashion ethos that supports people, the environment, creativity and profit in equal measures.\n\nREAD MORE: Save the planet, but make it fashion: SA Fashion Week commits to a sustainable fashion 5-year plan\n\nSA Fashion Week only aligns itself with premium brands that understand the power and influence of the creative fashion industry and the positive impact it can have on our economy.
