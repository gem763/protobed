The Leicester playmaker has been outstanding in the early stages of this tournament, but he is the one to make way, for the quarter-final against Australia in Oita on Saturday.\n\nOutside Farrell, there will be a midfield alliance of Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade, which is the same combination Jones deployed during the Six Nations earlier this year. Slade has been a bit-part player so far in Japan, having recovered from a knee ligament injury that he suffered in training during the warm-up campaign in August. Now he has been abruptly thrust back into the starting XV for this first round of the knock-out stages.\n\nGeorge Ford had started every match of England's World Cup campaign so far\n\nEddie Jones smiles as England train ahead of their World Cup quarter-final against Australia\n\nENGLAND TEAM TO PLAY AUSTRALIA E Daly (Saracens); A Watson (Bath), H Slade (Exeter), M Tuilagi (Leicester), J May (Leicester); O Farrell (Saracens), B Youngs (Leicester); M Vunipola (Saracens), J George (Saracens), K Sinckler (Harlequins); M Itoje (Saracens), C Lawes (Northampton); T Curry (Sale), B Vunipola (Saracens), S Underhill (Bath). Replacements: L Cowan-Dickie (Exeter), J Marler (Harlequins), D Cole (Leicester), G Kruis (Saracens), L Ludlam (Northampton), W Heinz (Gloucester), G Ford (Leicester), J Joseph (Bath).\n\nWith the Wallabies expected to unleash the powerful Samu Kerevi in their No 12 shirt, it appears that Jones has changed his back line to cope with that rampaging threat. 'Once you get to the quarter-finals, it's about having the right mind-set,' said the head coach. 'We know how well we can play, it's about us playing to our strengths and trying to take away from what Australia want.\n\n'Australia are a clever team. They will have some specific attacking strategies to play against us so we need to have a great situational awareness. We need to defend with brutality and when we have the ball we need play on top of them.'\n\nWhile the explanation makes sense, this is an unexpected, ruthless selection. There has been a focus on selflessness within the Red Rose squad and a 'Team of 31' mantra to highlight their collective objectives. However, deep down, Ford will be stunned and stung by this loss of his starting place. Farrell was the preferred fly-half throughout last season, but Ford had been inspirational in a struggling Leicester team and had forced his way back into the England side on merit.\n\nThis is a case of history repeating itself at World Cups. Back in 2015, Ford was the starting 10 for the tournament opener against Fiji, but the-then head coach Stuart Lancaster changed his plans and opted for Farrell in the subsequent matches against Wales and Australia, which England lost to go out of their home showpiece at the end of the pool stage.\n\nEngland captain Owen Farrell shifts in one place in the backline to start at fly-half\n\nThe unveiling of a revised 10-12-13 unit will draw some attention away from the reuniting of the Vunipola brothers in the starting line-up. Mako has been picked at loosehead prop, ahead of Joe Marler, after painstakingly recovering from his hamstring injury over the summer \u2013 which initially required surgery and which he aggravated during the August encounter with Ireland. The Lion is short of game-time, but Jones will argue that his training load has alleviated that issue.\n\nAt No 8, Billy Vunipola retains his place after regaining full fitness, having twisted his ankle in the emphatic win over the Pumas. He wouldn't have been ready to face France last weekend, but that fixture was cancelled due to the arrival of typhoon Hagibis and with an additional week of rehab, the giant Saracen has been cleared to retain his place at the base of the scrum.\n\nThere is one other starting change, with Northampton's veteran lock Courtney Lawes preferred to George Kruis in the second row. His inclusion is another example of Jones's emphasis on defensive ferocity for this clash with Australia.\n\nMarler, Kruis and Ford are all among the bench reserves, while Bath centre Jonathan Joseph has also been included, in place of the injured Jack Nowell.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN JAPAN: Eddie Jones has delivered a World Cup selection shock by dropping the in-form George Ford, to allow captain Owen Farrell to start at 10 in a reshuffled, reinforced midfield line-up.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/02/19816908-0-image-a-24_1571277204520.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
