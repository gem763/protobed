Although Peloton is known for its fitness equipment, it also offers a subscription service that streams live and recorded workout videos to screens on those devices. The subscription service allows it to stay connected with its customers \u2014 and provides it with an ongoing revenue stream \u2014 after they purchase its equipment.\n\nAccording to data in the paperwork Peloton's filed this week for its planned initial public offering, it has remarkably low churn, which could bode well for the long-term prospects of its business.\n\n\"Our compelling financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer acquisition,\" the company said in its IPO paperwork. \"Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, generates attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value.\"\n\nRead this: Peloton, the fitness startup with a cultlike following, could go public at an $8 billion valuation. Insiders reveal why its business seems set to explode.\n\nBut customer retention experts think Peloton's churn rate is understated in multiple ways and in the future will likely be significantly higher than it is now. Churn rates are commonly reported in the fitness industry, but they're not a particularly meaningful measure of customer value, said Paul Bedford, a principal at Retention Guru, a consulting firm that helps health clubs improve customer retention.\n\n\"I wouldn't invest any money based on that [churn] number,\" Bedford said. He continued: \"When I see that number, I just disregard it ... It's a vanity metric.\"\n\nPeloton's churn rate is far lower than Netflix's\n\nPeloton offers two different subscription services: one that's targeted at people who own one of its fitness bikes or treadmills, for which it charges $39 a month, and one that designed for folks who don't own any of its equipment, for which it charges $19.49. The churn rates it discloses are for the former \u2014 for people who own its equipment, which it calls its \"connected fitness subscribers.\"\n\nIn its IPO filing, Peloton reported that it had a churn rate of just 0.65% per month in its most recent fiscal year, which ended in June. That rate was up slightly from fiscal 2018, when its churn was 0.64%, but down from fiscal 2017, when its rate was 0.7%.\n\nPeloton offers both fitness equipment, like its stationary bike, and a subscription video service that streams live and recorded workouts. Peloton\n\nThe churn rate Peloton posted in its most recent year works out to be a little less than 7% on annual basis. That's an extraordinarily low figure. Planet Fitness, which operates a chain of gyms, has an annualized churn rate of 18% to 30% \u2014 and far higher than that in the first few months after people sign up for a membership, according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Netflix, long the paragon of a successful digital subscription business, has a churn rate of around 9% a quarter \u2014 or about 36% a year \u2014 the Financial Times estimated last year, citing several different studies.\n\nPeloton thinks the churn figures are so important that it touts them on the second official page of its filing and talks about its low churn rate some 27 other times.\n\n\"Usage drives value and loyalty, which is evidenced by our consistently low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn,\" it says in one section of the document. \"Our unit economic model benefits from low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn and high Subscription Contribution Margin,\" it continues in another section.\n\nBut Peloton's churn rate shouldn't be taken at face value, retention experts said.\n\nIts churn rate \"doesn't pass the smell test\"\n\nBy dividing 1 by the churn rate, you can get a rough estimate of how long the average customer sticks with the service before cancelling, said Daniel McCarthy, an associate professor of marketing at Emory University's Goizueta Business School. Doing that calculation with Peloton's customer churn rate implies that the average customer would stay with its service for about 154 months or nearly 13 years, he said.\n\nThat's almost twice as long as Pelton has been in existence. It's also far longer than its equipment is likely to last, McCarthy said. And when their bikes or treadmills breakdown, some customers may replace them, but others won't and will likely cancel their service.\n\nThe churn rate Peloton gave \"doesn't pass the smell test,\" McCarthy said.\n\nReed Hastings has built one of the leading digital subscription businesses as the CEO of Netflix, but his company's estimated churn rate is far greater than Peloton's.

Ruscio/Getty Images for Netflix\n\nIndeed, Peloton's filing makes clear that the churn rate is almost certainly understated.\n\nFor example, the company allows customers to pause the subscription service for as long as three months. But it continues to count those customers as active subscribers even while their subscriptions are paused. Such customers may not have churned yet, but they aren't paying company any money either.\n\nPeloton didn't disclose what portion of its connected fitness subscriber base \u2014 which hit 511,202 at the end of June \u2014 had paused its subscriptions. Nor did it reveal what portion of those that paused their subscriptions cancelled them right after that interruption of service.\n\nBut there's likely a bigger factor at play with Peloton's churn rates. Up until July of last year, the company offered customers the chance to sign up for extended subscription agreements. Customers could sign up for one or two years of service and get anywhere from one to three months for free. Alternatively, customers who used Peloton's financing service to purchase their equipment could include with their purchase a prepaid subscription lasting anywhere from one year to 39 months.\n\nThe company didn't disclose how many of its customers are still on those extended subscription plans. But it did say it will still have some customers on them into its 2022 fiscal year. Peloton includes those customers when calculating its churn rate. That's a bit misleading, because it means the churn figure includes people who haven't really had the opportunity to leave yet, Bedford said.\n\n\"Why would you leave after you prepaid [for the service] with a great deal?\" said Joel Shapiro, an associate professor of data analytics at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. \"When you talk about churn rate being low,\" he continued, \"you sort of assume that the people in the calculation should be those that actually, arguably, could churn. And when you have somebody who's under contract for two more years, it arguably doesn't make any sense to include them in the calculation.\"\n\nIt's quite likely that as those long-term deals expire, Peloton will see a spike in its churn rates, retention experts said. The company might well be seeing an uptick in subscription cancellations now, one year after it stopped selling its one-year plans, Bedford said.\n\n\"There's a whole bunch of people who are coming to the end of the subscription period who may not renew,\" he said.\n\nNew subscribers are likely distorting the picture\n\nAnother factor that's likely helping Peloton minimize its churn rate is just the sheer number of new subscribers it has been adding. The number of people subscribing to its connected fitness service more than doubled in each of its last two fiscal years, going from 107,708 in June 2017 to 245,667 in June 2018 to more than 500,000 this past June.\n\nBecause the churn rate is derived in part from the number of overall subscribers a company has, even if it's losing a large number of subscribers, the rate can look low if it's consistently adding many more.\n\n\"Their [churn] numbers in the early years you would expect to be low,\" said Dave Rochlin, the executive director of the Innovation, Creativity, and Design Practice at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business.\n\nWhat's more, new subscribers are often less likely to cancel a service, because they tend to be the most enthusiastic customers, Rochlin That's particularly true with Peloton, because it's new subscribers have just spent \u2014 or are in the process of spending \u2014 thousands of dollars on its equipment, he said.\n\n\"If you think about the size of investment you're making on that piece of equipment, it's pretty likely you're not going to turn around and cancel service right away,\" Rochlin said.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Peloton has a bad business or that it's done anything wrong in calculating or presenting its churn rate, the retention experts said. But it does mean that investors shouldn't be surprised if that rate starts to tick upward in the near future.\n\nBecause of the factors that seem to be playing a role in keeping Peloton's churn rate low, \"this all feels a little bit like a game that's being played,\" Shapiro, of the Kellogg School, said.\n\nGot a tip about Peloton or another company?
