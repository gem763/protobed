You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnger at overpaid bosses is not unique to Britain. Surveys in the US, where chief executives earn on average 312 times more than their workers, have come to similar conclusions. Pay at the top has soared over the decades \u2013 in 1989 US chief executives earned 58 times more and in 1965 only 20 times more.\n\n\u201cThere is no avoiding the fact that business is increasingly unpopular, and that the public is calling capitalism itself into question,\u201d Global Future said.\n\n\u201cCapitalism is at risk from a new generation of populists seeking to harness public anger at the way the system works.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
