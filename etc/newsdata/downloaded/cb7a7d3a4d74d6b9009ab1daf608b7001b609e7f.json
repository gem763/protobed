The movement has gained traction as Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen activist, inspires millions of people across the globe to take to the streets and voice their anger over what she says is a climate crisis.\n\nPersson, who has been running H&M for a decade, says his concern is that the movement seeks to prohibit behaviors. Many of the protests are \u201cabout \u2018stop doing things, stop consuming, stop flying\u2019,\u201d Persson said in an interview in Stockholm. \u201cYes, that may lead to a small environmental impact, but it will have terrible social consequences.\u201d\n\nThe H&M CEO is a key figure in the $2.5 trillion (R36 trillion) fashion industry that has come under increasing scrutiny amid concerns about pollution and workers\u2019 rights in the developing economies that have tended to do the bulk of the manufacturing.\n\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe says part of the problem is that consumers have been gripped by an \u201cera of fast fashion\u201d that has led to an \u201cenvironmental and social emergency.\u201d The clothing industry is responsible for about 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and consumes more energy than aviation and shipping combined, according to the UN.\n\nPersson says that \u201cthe climate issue is incredibly important. It\u2019s a huge threat and we all need to take it seriously - politicians, companies, individuals. At the same time, the elimination of poverty is a goal that\u2019s at least as important.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must reduce the environmental impact,\u201d Persson said. \u201cAt the same time we must also continue to create jobs, get better healthcare and all the things that come with economic growth.\u201d\n\nH&M estimates that about 70% of a garment\u2019s impact on the climate happens during the manufacturing process. By 2040, H&M intends to be climate positive, which it says means reducing more greenhouse gas emissions than its value chain emits.\n\nThe company says it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s biggest users of organic and recycled cotton, citing data from Textile Exchange, a non-profit organization. And H&M has started exploring some unconventional fabrics specifically designed to incorporate recycling into the mix, such as citrus peel and old fishnets. The company also works with governments to help install solar panels and other renewable energy solutions to make local factories more sustainable.\n\nPersson says things like \u201cenvironmental innovation, renewable energy, improved materials\u201d are better ways to tackle climate change than a moratorium on consumption. \u201cContinue to focus very much on the environmental issue, but have an open discussion about what the solution is,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nShares in H&M have gained more than 60% this year after the company lost about a quarter of its market value in 2018.", "description": "The chief executive officer of fashion giant Hennes & Mauritz AB says a growing movement that shames consumers represents a very real social threat.", "authors": ["Hanna Hoikkala"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9095/ef841b675be9420fbdf982b3917909ce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
