She doesn\u2019t flinch from digging into life\u2019s messiness, pressing gently but resolutely into wounds to see what oozes out. There\u2019s big stuff, like acrimonious divorce, trust-shattering affairs, sexual and psychological abuse. But it\u2019s the small stuff \u2013 insecurity, lost youth, everyday loneliness \u2013 that quietly devastates.\n\nAttenberg\u2019s medium, as much as the written word, is familial dysfunction. And the Tuchman family is a matryoshka stacking doll of dysfunction. The layers of rot start to be revealed when patriarch Victor is felled and hospitalized by a heart attack. For many families, an impending death might be a catalyst for reckoning and reconciliation.\n\nBut for the Tuchmans, all roads lead to more dysfunction.\n\nViktor was a violent man, profligate in his brutality, a criminal real-estate magnate with seemingly little love for anything but power. While he mostly reserved the physical abuse for his wife, Barbra, his violence still distorts his children, daughter Alex and son Gary, now grown, seeping through the cracks in the barriers they\u2019ve erected around their lives.\n\nAlex is still grappling with the fallout of her recent divorce, missing her only daughter, who\u2019s with her dad for the summer, when Barbra calls.\n\n\u201cShe had given up on her parents years ago,\u201d Attenberg writes of Alex. \u201cThings would never be honest between them. So why bother with any relationship at all?\u201d But Alex takes the call anyway, and she makes the trip to her father\u2019s deathbed in sweltering New Orleans. \u201cNow, things could be different.\u201d She\u2019s determined to get answers, thinking the truth \u2013 of her father\u2019s criminal enterprise, of her parents\u2019 inexplicable and enduring marriage \u2013 will set her free.\n\nGary, though, steadfastly refuses to engage. He\u2019s out in California, ostensibly for work, though something seems to be amiss with his marriage, too. His wife, Twyla, a charming Southern beauty and seemingly devoted wife and mother, flutters around dying Victor, Bible in hand. Victor and Barbra aren\u2019t the only ones safeguarding family secrets.\n\n\u201cAll This Could Be Yours\u201d is an emotionally messy novel, but precise in craft. The narrative voice is complex and profound, jumping from head to head, consciousness to consciousness, inhabiting main characters and peripheral figures alike. Attenberg writes with care about even the most glancing characters \u2013 a random streetcar driver, a Pilates instructor on a hike, a stroke victim sharing Victor\u2019s hospital ward \u2013 her narrative touching so many souls, it\u2019s like a spirit passing through.\n\nAlex wants answers, but even when she gets them, she doesn\u2019t really, and neither do we. Despite direct access to people\u2019s innermost thoughts, their hearts remain shrouded, a little piece of them forever unknowable. In the end, we\u2019re little closer to understanding why Victor was the way he was, why Barbra loved him or why such abuse was allowed to perpetuate.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to explain who she was to anyone,\u201d Attenberg writes of Barbra. \u201cShe would prefer to remain a beautiful mystery, her soul lingering forever in a shimmering haze. Her truth was for no one but herself.\u201d\n\nEven in the absence of that understanding, we are left more inclined toward empathy.
