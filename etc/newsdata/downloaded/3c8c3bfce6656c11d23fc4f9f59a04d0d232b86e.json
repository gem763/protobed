But his most egregious act is possibly wearing \u2013 day-in, day-out \u2013 a gilet.\n\nFrench for vest, this item of clothing would seem to be the extremely Europhobic Cummings\u2019 sartorial bread and butter. He is rarely seen not wearing one \u2013 or without the minutes for a covert plan to undermine democracy.\n\nCummings\u2019 style has caught the eye of politicos, which some dismiss as a trivial matter. But in the political arena, image matters. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 80s power suits were scrutinised; David Cameron\u2019s switching of his parting was national news (Cameron later nominated his barber for an MBE); and eyebrows were raised at Theresa May\u2019s favourite and incongruous Frida Kahlo bracelet.\n\nWith Cummings, analysis of his clothing also acts as a knowledge gap-filler, because the man seemingly running the country is an enigma. We must mine each aspect of his character for clues as to what\u2019s next. Sure, Cummings has a blog (now dormant) \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to say it doesn\u2019t have some clever ideas \u2013 but it also reads as though he went to a lot of evening classes at Alain de Botton\u2019s The School of Life.\n\nIn the 19th century, a gilet was more frequently an embroidered waistcoat and closer to a jerkin (a close-fitting open vest popular in the 16th century). Nowadays, it is a versatile garment: a sporty, padded body-warmer made popular by snowboarders; a reversible combination of suede and shearling for late-morning coffees or school runs; or the rabbit fur that Sienna Miller teamed with Ugg boots and every single festival between 2002 and 2004, AKA the era of boho.\n\nIn the era of Bojo, Cummings\u2019 favourite item is quilted and navy blue with a burgundy trim. I did think it might be Barbour, which would be fitting for a man whose father-in-law lives in a castle. But, on closer inspection, I spotted a hare logo and discovered it is made by Joules. A similar item \u2013 in marine navy \u2013 goes for an extremely reasonable \u00a369.95 (in clearance). Joules is a British company (thank God!) inspired by \u201ccountry lifestyles\u201d. As fashion journalist and Vogue columnist Raven Smith observes: \u201cHe dresses like a student popping to the 24-hour garage for cereal during a Fortnite binge. With all the sweatshirts-com-epaulettes, he\u2019s over-layering so it\u2019s a filo pastry of threadbare athleisure. A proper coat would do.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Plans for global domination \u2026 Pinky and the Brain, AKA Dominic Cummings. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nCummings reminds me of Brain from Steven Spielberg\u2019s Pinky and the Brain. This isn\u2019t based on the fact he is bald. Many people are bald. It is because of the lightbulb shape of his skull, his pointy ears and popping eyes, and the fact that his ambition is the same as Brain\u2019s: taking over the world.\n\nVery occasionally, Brain wears a suit when plotting. In 2001, when he was campaign director at Business for Sterling, Cummings wore a suit. Floppy but thinning hair, hands jauntily in his pockets \u2013 and in another shot, a cigarette languidly between his fingers \u2013 the vibe is very \u201cauthor photograph on the inside jacket of a self-published novel\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Cummings in 2001 with his \u2018author of a self-published novel\u2019 look.

His signature twist is to rock a collar with one side tucked and the other not, embracing the asymmetrical trend exemplified by the much talked about Ksenia Schnaider jeans. At least Cummings\u2019 shirts are mostly white, which, I used to think, was a classic staple difficult to get wrong. Except it is unclear whether Cummings owns an iron (perhaps too much a signifier of rich remainers). Mostly, he wears his shirts spilling over his jeans, apart from when he once tucked it in with a brown belt, which did not do its job, revealing the evil genius\u2019s black boxers in a look more commonly seen in a drill video than on the steps of No 10.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Cummings\u2019 unequal collar look.

You might think nothing much can be gleaned from Cummings\u2019 old tees, except one of these logos looks a little like a wigwam emitting a signal. Further research reveals that it is the logo of Sci Foo camp, described as an \u201cunconference\u201d for emerging technology and scientific ideas. Unconference. Classic Dom. (The camps are held annually at the Googleplex in California.) Take his shoes off and this could be a Steve Hilton look.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Cummings in his Sci Foo T-shirt. Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlso: tote bags. Cummings loves a tote. He carries around a Vote Leave-branded one in the manner of someone who went to Daunt, once. It\u2019s from 2016, of course, this canvas of lies, which means it could probably be sold as vintage for \u00a330 in a Hackney pop-up. He has also been spotted with a tote-with-a-quote: \u201cIt was nine-thirty on Christmas Eve \u2026\u201d The opening line of Susan Hill\u2019s Woman in Black; a 1983 Gothic-inspired horror novel. Gothic-inspired horror doesn\u2019t seem too far away from where we currently are.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Cummings with his Vote Leave tote.

This is a 90s skateboarder staple or an ex-boyfriend\u2019s garment that is frequently worn by women around the house or for casual Sunday roasts, drawstrings pulled tight. Of course, Cummings made it weird by shoulder-robing it.\n\nIs this new wardrobe addition a sign that the often implosive, sweary Cummings (spotted recently stalking the halls of the palace with a red wine) will take a more casual approach to his career? Almost certainly not, as the country struggles through an apparently endless constitutional crisis or heads to a general election. We await with baited breath the clues to come from further tote and tee logos.", "description": "From his quilted gilet and tote bags to his crumpled shirts and hoodie, Cummings\u2019 look is as chaotic and misguided as the no deal Brexit he is determined to realise", "authors": ["Hannah Jane Parkinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d7be25577f8da4dee563e385c4333bc8871bd9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=03fa1c3f21cd01b7622d3b9099cb5fb4", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
