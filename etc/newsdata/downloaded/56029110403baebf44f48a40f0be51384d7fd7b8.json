[nL5N25Z0IX]\n\nNO-DEAL BREXIT BLOCK\n\nJohnson and other senior ministers say they are coming up with new proposals and that progress is being made in talks.\n\nFinance minister Sajid Javid said Johnson would go to an EU summit on Oct. 17 to try to secure that deal.\n\n\"The prime minister will go to the council meeting on the 17th and 18th (of October), he'll be trying to strike a deal. He absolutely will not be asking for an extension in that meeting,\" Javid told the BBC.\n\nOne of the main sticking points has been disagreement over the Irish 'backstop' - an insurance policy to prevent the return of visible checks on the border between the Irish Republic and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nJohnson goes to Dublin on Monday for talks with his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar, but expectations are low.\n\n\"I don't think the meeting tomorrow is a high-stakes meeting in that I don't anticipate a big breakthrough,\" Varadkar said on Sunday. \"If we come to an agreement, that will happen most likely in October at the EU summit.\"\n\nThe bill requiring Johnson to seek a Brexit extension is due to become law on Monday when it receives the assent of Queen Elizabeth, a move Johnson said would destroy Britain's negotiating strategy by removing the threat of a 'no-deal' exit.\n\nForeign minister Dominic Raab said the government would \"test to the limit\" what the law would require ministers to do, and the Daily Telegraph reported that his office was exploring how it could sabotage any extension request by making it clear to the EU that it did not want a delay.\n\nIrish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told BBC radio: \"I think it would be reasonable to say that, from our point of view, we would be in favour of an extension that would create the space to hopefully conclude where we are. But it is a matter that needs full agreement across the European Council.\"", "description": "Johnson again bids for snap poll as Brexit delay bill to become law", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF880OA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
