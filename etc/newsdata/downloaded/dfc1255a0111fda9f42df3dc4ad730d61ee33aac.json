Being oh so clever, and knowing exactly what it was they were doing, they opted to couch their fascist instinct as a personal inquiry so that they would know who not to work with.\n\nIn response to a Hollywood Reporter tweet announcing that President Donald Trump would be appearing in a Beverly Hills fundraiser in mid-September, Mr. McCormack tweeted, \u201cHey, kindly report on everyone attending this event so the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with. Thx.\u201d Ms. Messing issued her support for the creation of the list shortly thereafter, tweeting the trade magazine should \u201cprint a list of all attendees please\u201d adding that \u201cthe public has a right to know.\u201d\n\nSTEVE LEVY: TO DEBRA MESSING AND THE LEFT \u2013 I DIDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP IN 2016. NOW, I WILL\n\nThe two actors are friends, so it\u2019s not a stretch to believe this to be a dumb but coordinated effort repeating what Rep. Joaquin Castro did in Texas when he released the names and employers of local Trump donors.\n\nBoth Ms. Messing and Mr. McCormack are middle-aged. They\u2019re not 20-somethings with no education about U.S. history, which would include the 1950s\u2019 McCarthy-era and the blacklisting of actors and other creative people who were, or just thought to be, associated with the Communist Party.\n\nThe good news is they were confronted on social media and on various television programs for the obvious call for a blacklist. After all, there\u2019s only one reason you put out a public call to create a list of people and that is to invite shunning, harassment, and sometimes even violence, against those whom you are targeting.\n\nThat didn\u2019t seem to matter until Whoopi Goldberg condemned them both on national television. The cohost of \u201cThe View\u201d did something remarkable, not just because of her liberalism, but because she is the only Hollywood liberal, so far, to slam the two actors for calling for something that is, in fact, fascist.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter said, \u201c\u2026 Whoopi Goldberg was not pleased that Messing and McCormack would make such a request. In a heated dialogue with fellow panelists Joy Behar and Sunny Hostin, Goldberg said that \u2018the last time people did this, it did not end well. \u2026 We had something called a blacklist, and a lot of really good people were accused of stuff. Nobody cared whether it was true or not. They were accused. And they lost their right to work. \u2026 In this country, people can vote for who they want to. That is one of the great rights of this country. You don\u2019t have to like it, but we don\u2019t go after people because we don\u2019t like who they voted for. We don\u2019t go after them that way. We can talk about issues and stuff, but we don\u2019t print out lists.\u2019\u201d\n\nLo and behold after that exchange, Mr. McCormack issued a statement, insisting that he doesn\u2019t support blacklists. Reports were that he was \u201cwalking back\u201d his comments, but that\u2019s not entirely accurate. Instead, he insisted he had been \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d and that while he doesn\u2019t support blacklists or discrimination of any kind, he added, on Instagram, \u201cI\u2019d simply like to understand where Trump\u2019s major donations are coming from which is a matter of public record. I am holding myself responsible for making educated and informed decisions that I can morally and ethically standby and to do that transparency is essential.\u201d\n\nWhat utter nonsense. I\u2019m sure if he could have added an insincere confused shrug, he would have.\n\nMs. Messing, in the meantime, retweeted that, saying she agrees completely. Of course she does. \u201cI couldn\u2019t of said it better,\u201d is how she chimed in on Twitter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThere is an importance to this charade in that it reveals and confirms what we\u2019ve seen the Democratic Party and liberals as they devolve back into the most natural state of the left \u2014 slouching toward the desire to harm, and even destroy, those with whom they disagree.\n\nKeep in mind, the call itself for the creation of a blacklist is actually the totalitarian aspect \u2014 an overarching threat meant to frighten and intimidate people from acting on their own personal beliefs, political, social or cultural. It is meant to stomp on the virtual neck of anyone who may dare think for themselves.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFrom Rep. Maxine Waters calling for personal direct harassment of Trump supporters, to Mr. Castro, who released the names and employers of Trump donors in Texas, and now for these two sitcom actors calling for a list of political heretics, the point is to frighten, intimidate, bully and threaten people into silence and retreat.\n\nThis tells you everything you need to know about the Democratic Party, the liberal establishment and their enforcers, and it is vital you remember in 2020.", "description": "Two actors who are best known for a television sitcom that aired more than a decade ago have found a new lease on life \u2014 exposing for all of us of the totalitarian instincts of liberals.", "authors": ["Tammy Bruce"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/04/694940094001_6083521407001_6083522418001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
