Its Residents Are Shocked.", "language": "en", "text": "SYDNEY \u2014 The island of Tulagi served as a South Pacific headquarters for Britain then Japan, and during World War II, its natural deepwater harbor made it a military gem. Now, China is moving in with plans to effectively take control.\n\n\n\nUnder a secretive deal signed last month with a provincial government in the Solomon Islands, a Beijing-based company with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party has secured exclusive development rights for the entire island of Tulagi and its surroundings.\n\n\n\nThe lease agreement has shocked Tulagi residents and alarmed U.S. officials who see the island chains of the South Pacific as crucial to keeping China in check and protecting important sea routes. It is the latest example of China using promises of prosperity to pursue its global aspirations \u2014 often by funneling money to governments and investing in local infrastructure projects that critics call debt traps for developing nations.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe geography tells you that this is a good location,\u201d said Anne-Marie Brady, a China scholar at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. \u201cChina is expanding its military assets into the South Pacific and is looking for friendly ports and friendly airfields just like other rising powers before them.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeijing\u2019s ambitions in the South Pacific have economic, political and military ramifications.\n\n\n\nThe region is rich in natural resources, and China\u2019s investments have provoked worries in the United States and Australia that the projects could give Beijing an opening to establish a military foothold for everything from ships and planes to its own version of the Global Positioning System.\n\n\n\nChina is also pushing to end the region\u2019s status as a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan. The Solomons cut ties to Taipei and allied with Beijing just a few days before the Tulagi deal. A second Pacific nation, Kiribati, followed suit the same week.\n\n\n\nEven compared to previous Chinese development deals in nearby countries \u2014 including a wharf in Vanuatu, whose terms were not publicly released for years \u2014 the Tulagi agreement is remarkable for both its scope and lack of public input.\n\n\n\nThe renewable 75-year lease was granted to the China Sam Enterprise Group, a conglomerate founded in 1985 as a state-owned enterprise, according to corporate records.\n\n\n\nA copy of the \u201cstrategic cooperation agreement,\u201d obtained by The New York Times and verified by two people with knowledge of the deal, reveals both the immediate ambitions of China Sam and the potential \u2014 just as in Vanuatu \u2014 for infrastructure that could share civilian and military uses.\n\n\n\nSigned on Sept. 22, the agreement includes provisions for a fishery base, an operations center, and \u201cthe building or enhancement of the airport.\u201d Though there are no confirmed oil or gas reserves in the Solomons, the agreement also notes that China Sam is interested in building an oil and gas terminal.\n\n\n\nThese are just the explicit possibilities. The document also states that the government will lease all of Tulagi and the surrounding islands in the province for the development of \u201ca special economic zone or any other industry that is suitable for any development.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe provincial governor who signed the deal, Stanley Maniteva, could not be reached for comment. Noting that laws and landowner rights would be respected, he told local reporters this week that the agreement had not been completed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to make clear that the agreement does not bear the official stamp of the province so it is not official and formalized yet,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBut many residents of Tulagi, an island of a little over 1,000 people, are taking the signing of the document to mean it is a real agreement, and outrage has quickly set in.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey cannot come in and lease the whole island like that,\u201d said Michael Salini, 46, a business owner on Tulagi who is helping organize a petition to oppose the China Sam agreement.\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone is really scared about the possibility of China turning the island into a military base,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is what really scares people \u2014 because why else do they want to lease the whole island?\u201d\n\n\n\nA military installation would carry strategic and symbolic significance. Some U.S. officials believe China\u2019s efforts in the region echo the period before and during World War II, when Japan wrested control of island assets, which were won back in turn by American and Australian troops in bloody battles.\n\n\n\nBut it is also a matter of feasibility: China goes where there is value and interest. With the United States pulling back in much of the world under President Donald Trump\u2019s America First policy, Beijing is often knocking on doors left open.\n\n\n\nSome U.S. and Solomon Islands officials note that Chinese businesses and officials have cultivated local politicians for years with bribes and gifts like luxury trips to China and Singapore. In a poor country of 600,000 people with a national Parliament of 50 members, it does not take much to tilt debate, they argue.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat worries me much more about the new Chinese engagement, be it political or economic, in the Pacific is the way in which this engagement is taking place, being lubricated by elite capture and corruption,\u201d said Jonathan Pryke, a Pacific islands expert with the Lowy Institute in Sydney. Though patronage and corruption have long been a challenge, he added, \u201cthis engagement has certainly taken it to a whole new level.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister of the Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, visited China this month. Photographs from the trip showed him smiling with China Sam executives.\n\n\n\nThe visit carried a whiff of victory for Beijing. It followed a failed lobbying effort by Australia and the United States to keep the Solomons loyal to Taiwan and the alignment that began when U.S. Marines dislodged Japanese troops from Tulagi and Guadalcanal in 1942.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, visited the Solomons in June \u2014 the first official visit by an Australian leader in a decade. He announced an infrastructure program worth up to 250 million Australian dollars, or about $168 million, in grant financing over 10 years.\n\n\n\nVice President Mike Pence also pressed Sogavare to hold off on deciding about Taiwan, promising infrastructure investments and making plans for an in-person discussion in September around the time of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\n\n\nBut Sogavare then announced the severing of ties with Taiwan, and Pence canceled the meeting.\n\n\n\nStill, some argue that the United States could revive support.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late in the game,\u201d said Phillip Tagini, a mining executive who served in the Solomons as a prime minister\u2019s adviser from 2012 to 2015. \u201cAt this stage we don\u2019t have the history with China to say we can trust them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter an election in 2006, rioting and violence broke out amid allegations that money from Chinese businessmen had rigged the results. Protests also greeted Sogavare\u2019s election win in April, with demonstrators marching toward the capital\u2019s Chinatown to register discontent.\n\n\n\n\u201cSeparate from China\u2019s agenda is the risk of destabilizing a vulnerable society,\u201d Brady said.\n\n\n\nBut the tangible effects of the deals being struck now, some say, could win over even the skeptics.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fact is, people in the Solomons are going to see infrastructure from China, and when they see these things happening they are going to say, \u2018Wow, this is what we were waiting for,\u2019\u201d Tagini said. \u201cIf the Americans are going to come, they need to choose where their impacts are going to be seen. They need to be seen.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n", "description": "SYDNEY -- The island of Tulagi served as a South Pacific headquarters for Britain then Japan, and during World War II, its natural deepwater harbor made it a military gem.
