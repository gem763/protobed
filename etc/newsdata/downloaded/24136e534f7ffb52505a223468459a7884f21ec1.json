Their brother Jordie starts on the right wing.\n\nScott and Jordie came off the bench to join Beauden in an All Blacks match for the first time in 2017 against Samoa. They also appeared that year against the British and Irish Lions in the third test. They made their first start together last year against France.\n\nThe Vunipolas in 1995 for Tonga were the first trio of brothers to make a Rugby World Cup. Elisi and Manu Vunipola started against France, and Fe\u2019ao came off the bench to become the first trio to play in the same game. Four days later, they all started against Scotland.\n\nNew Zealand has two Pool B games in five days, with Namibia on Sunday in Tokyo, so coach Steve Hansen said everyone in the 31-man squad was going to play. Captain and No. 8 Kieran Read and flyhalf Richie Mo\u2019unga were the only other All Blacks making a second straight start.\n\nThe All Blacks will meet Canada for the first time since the 2011 World Cup. Read, Sam Whitelock and Sonny Bill Williams survive from that game, won 79-15.\n\n\u201cCanada are a proud nation who are led by Tyler Ardron, a player who we respect and know very well from his time in New Zealand with the Chiefs,\u201d New Zealand coach Steve Hansen said. \u201cWe are sure his attitude of not taking a backward step will be reflected throughout the whole team.\n\n\u201cThat means we need to impose ourselves on the game from the very start.\u201d\n\nCanada lost its opener to Italy 48-7 last week, and names its team later Monday.\n\n___\n\nNew Zealand: Beauden Barrett, Jordie Barrett, Jack Goodhue, Sonny Bill Williams, Rieko Ioane, Richie Mo\u2019unga, TJ Perenara; Kieran Read (captain), Matt Todd, Shannon Frizell, Scott Barrett, Patrick Tuipulotu, Angus Ta\u2019avao, Liam Coltman, Atu Moli.
