(Steven Senne/AP)\n\nChargers running back Melvin Gordon\u2019s holdout for a new contract has no end in sight, but his employer\u2019s recent declaration that he can seek a trade encouraged at least one team to pick up the phone.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles offered to send the Los Angeles Chargers running back Jordan Howard, along with a swap of mid-round picks, in exchange for Gordon, according to the MMQB. The proposal also included the Chargers paying some of Gordon\u2019s salary.\n\nThe Chicago Bears traded Howard to the Eagles in March in exchange for a conditional 2020 sixth-round pick. Howard broke the Bears\u2019 rookie rushing record with his 1,313-yard performance in 2016, but his yards-per-carry dipped the last two seasons.\n\nThe Chargers are reportedly seeking a 2020 first-round pick or a 2020 fifth-round pick and a 2021 first-round pick to acquire Gordon so naturally, they rejected Philadelphia\u2019s offer.\n\nGordon, the 15th overall pick in the 2015 draft, is a two-time pro bowler and is in the final year of his rookie deal, which pays him $5.6 million this season. But the 26-year-old is reportedly seeking an extension worth $13 million annually.\n\nDallas Cowboys star running back Ezekiel Elliott agreed to a six-year, $90 million extension on Wednesday, making him the league\u2019s highest-paid running back with an annual average value of $15 million.\n\n[Sorry, Melvin Gordon, but Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s contract is an outlier among running backs]\n\nElliott\u2019s performance in his first three seasons (4,048 yards on the ground and a two-time NFL rushing leader) and value to the Cowboys offense seemed to justify a substantial raise, despite the increasingly disposable nature of the running back position.\n\nIn his first four seasons, Gordon has gained 3,628 yards and scored 28 touchdowns. He only has one 1,000-yard season to his name but has at least 400 receiving yards each of the last three years.\n\nChargers quarterback Philip Rivers downplayed (inadvertently or not) Gordon\u2019s role in their offense at the beginning of training camp.\n\n\u201cIt certainly is a deep position for us, and those guys all love to play and work hard,\u201d Rivers said in support of the running backs who were at camp. \u201cWe love Melvin, but we\u2019re going to go with what we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s a pretty dang good group.\u201d\n\nKansas City Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu tweeted a story featuring Rivers\u2019 quote, simply saying \u201cDAMN.\u201d\n\nGordon responded to Mathieu with, \u201cWild right !!\u201d\n\nWild right !! https://t.co/iNudX8pHVl \u2014 F L \u26a1\ufe0f S H (@Melvingordon25) July 26, 2019\n\nRivers clarified his comments last month.\n\n\u201cI know Melvin knows I\u2019m pulling for him,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cAnd in saying that, that means you want what\u2019s best for him. You want him to feel great. You want him to be at peace with how it all ends, and hopefully it\u2019s right here.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers currently boast a running back committee, led by Austin Ekeler and Justin Jackson. Ekeler ran for 554 yards in 2018 while Jackson averaged 4.1 yards-per-carry in his rookie season.\n\nChargers General Manager Tom Telesco said Sunday that the team told Gordon\u2019s agents that they will not negotiate a new contract until after the season.\n\n\u201cWe have to get focused on the season and our next opponent,\u201d Telesco said. \u201cSo when or if Melvin reports, he\u2019ll play this season on his current contract, and we\u2019ll just revisit it after the season.\u201d\n\nGordon will reportedly \u201cexplore his options,\u201d which includes returning to the Chargers.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s trade deadline is Tuesday, October 29 at 4 p.m.\n\nMore NFL:\n\nCowboys didn\u2019t play hardball with Ezekiel Elliott. A Super Bowl shot was too much to pass up.\n\nAntonio Brown lashes out at Raiders over being fined nearly $54,000\n\nDeAndre Hopkins felt \u2018like I\u2019m a slave\u2019 after late Texans owner\u2019s \u2018inmates\u2019 comment", "description": "Per reports, Philadelphia was were rebuffed due to the Chargers' steep asking price for the fifth-year running back.", "authors": ["Jake Russell", "Sports News Aide", "September At Pm", "Jake Russell Has Been A Sports News Aide", "Blogger With The Washington Post Since His Book", "Things Nationals Fans Should Know", "Do Before They Die", "Was Published In"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6myPCYllCRy1lZcsX8lYoDSOPDY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZNBY7PFPDYI6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg"}
