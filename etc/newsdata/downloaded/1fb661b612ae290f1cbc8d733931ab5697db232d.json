No problem.'\n\n'It was a very good conversation,' he added, 'so Idon't know why they'd be calling Rick Perry. Idon't know why they'd be calling all these people. It's a very bad situation for our country.\n\nThe committee chairmen sent Perry a subpoena Thursday demanding documents related to a Ukrainian state-owned energy company as well as his involvement in the July call between Trump Zelensky. The committees set a deadline of Oct. 18.\n\nTrump has said Perry teed up the July 25 call, in which Trump suggested Ukraine should investigate his Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nHunter Biden held a lucrative seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that was under criminal investigation until his father, then the U.S. vice president, pressured Ukraine unto firing the prosecutor.\n\nA spokeswoman for Perry has said he wanted Trump to speak on energy matters with the Ukrainian leader as part of U.S. efforts to boost Western energy ties to Eastern Europe.\n\n'Recently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president's stark message to the Ukrainian president,' the three Democratic chairmen wrote.\n\n'These reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani's push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election.'\n\nThe Associated Press reported this week that a circle of businessmen and Republican donors touted their connections to Trump and his personal lawyer, Giuliani, as they sought to install new management at the top of Ukraine's state-owned gas company last spring.\n\nThe plan hit a snag after Zelinsky's election, but Perry took up the effort to install a friendlier management team at the company, Naftogaz. Perry attended Zelinsky's May 2019 inauguration as the administration's senior representative and met privately with Zelinsky. He has denied any wrongdoing,\n\nTwo Florida businessmen tied to Giuliani and the Ukraine investigation were charged Thursday with federal campaign finance violations.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested Wednesday trying to board an international flight with one-way tickets at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, according to Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.\n\nPerry met with counterparts from Ukraine and Poland this week to underscore an agreement intended to ease the way for U.S.-produced natural gas to be shipped to Poland and then piped into neighboring Ukraine.", "description": "'I just don't think\u00a0- you're running a country\u00a0- I just don't think that you can have all of these people testifying about every conversation you've had,' Trump said as he left for a political rally in Minnesota.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/19561960-0-image-a-37_1570745965897.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
