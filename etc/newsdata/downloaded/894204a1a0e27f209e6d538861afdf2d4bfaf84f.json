As a youngster, he would spend 10 kilometres a day walking to school,\u201d Stick told reporters on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe coaches and players always laugh when I tell this story of how, in the rural areas, if you kick a rugby ball, the coach will take you off the field.\n\n\u201cYou are not allowed (to kick). You are supposed to run and catch, that\u2019s all. So, he was never exposed to a game where there was kicking and aerial skills and stuff.\u201d\n\nPowerful and lightning quick, Mapimpi crossed the whitewash twice in the quarter-final win over the tournament hosts last weekend to move to the top of the try-scoring standings along with Josh Adams of Wales and Japan\u2019s Kotaro Matsushima.\n\nStick said he hoped the Springboks would give Mapimpi more opportunities to show off his prodigious finishing skills against Wales and illustrate once again the improvements he has made as a player over the last few years.\n\n\u201cHe was always very fit, very dedicated to what he wanted to achieve,\u201d Stick said.\n\n\u201cWhen we invited him to our camp last year, we knew what we were dealing with, and just wanted to make sure that we give him the best possible support, and improve his game.\n\n\u201cHe has developed as a player. It\u2019s a nice story to tell to youngsters, that irrespective of your background, if you really work hard, and your opportunity comes, you need to be ready.\u201d", "description": "South Africa's Makazole Mapimpi has been somewhat overshadowed by Cheslin Kolbe at the World Cup so far but with his fellow winger ruled out of the semi-final against Wales, the prolific finisher will have his chance to hog the limelight on Sunday.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444780690&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0G1-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
