And while some economists question whether another move would be necessary or effective, the two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is held amid increasing signs central bankers are on edge.\n\nIn a London speech, James Bullard, the St. Louis Fed\u2019s aggressively dovish president, displayed a forecast chart bathed in red, reflecting more downward revisions to the growth projections for the United States, the euro area, Britain and China.\n\n\u201cThe key risk is that this slowing may be sharper than anticipated,\u201d he told a conference of central bankers.\n\nAnd minutes of the Fed\u2019s policy meeting last month said a \u201cclearer picture\u201d is emerging of how the trade war could drive the United States into a downturn.\n\nLost export markets, weak demand and uncertainty could lead to a drawn-out slump in business investment, threatening hiring, consumer spending and the wider economy, according to the meeting\u2019s minutes.\n\nThat cautious sentiment is apparent in comments from many American businesses in the Fed\u2019s \u201cbeige book\u201d report, and corporate earnings this month have confirmed it: Ford, Boeing, Caterpillar and 3M have all said revenues suffered from falling sales in China.\n\nThe result: Futures markets overwhelmingly predict Powell will announce another cut in the benchmark borrowing rate on Wednesday in light of the darkening economic picture.\n\n\u2013 A \u2018Red Bull\u2019 economy \u2013\n\nAmerican consumers have been the star of the show this year, bearing the economy on their shoulders like Atlas while manufacturing, agriculture, business investment and exports have all withered.\n\nBut recent data have been a tad grim there too: annual consumption growth in August was the weakest in eight months, retail sales sank in September along with consumer confidence as word of looming tariffs spread.\n\nSo are we headed for a recession?\n\nNot clear, economists say.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, this is a Red Bull economy. If you\u2019re a big, strong lunk, you can take a lot of caffeine and power through,\u201d Adam Posen, president of Peterson Institute for International Economics, told reporters.\n\n\u201cEven if at some point you\u2019re going to crash, and even if at some point you\u2019re raising your odds of a heart attack, the odds are still small,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe US can, with bad fiscal policy and extreme measures, keep going.\u201d\n\nAnd some voices on the Fed also say more rate cuts are not necessary, and could create more dangers.\n\nThe normally dovish Charles Evans of the Chicago Fed said this month that interest rate policy is already \u201cin a good place\u201d as it is.\n\nAnd both Esther George of Kansas City and Eric Rosengren of Boston have resisted the last two rate cuts, warning that keeping rates low for too long comes at a cost, encouraging corporate America\u2019s dangerous debt binge, and threatening to make an eventual economic downturn even more destructive.\n\nMeanwhile, with unemployment at half-century lows, consumers should be able to go on spending.\n\n\u201cMy own outlook for the economy does not call for a monetary policy response,\u201d George said in a speech \u2014 but she noted that her view could change if consumer spending weakens further.\n\nEconomist Joel Naroff cautioned that the Fed might not be able to do anything to counteract Trump\u2019s trade war.\n\n\u201cThe simple reality is that interest rates are not going to solve the problem that\u2019s causing the risks,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cIf they implement a 25 percent tariff on Chinese goods, zero percent (interest rate) is not going to help,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cInterest rates do not solve political problems.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 White-hot panic about global trade may have eased a bit in recent weeks but the economic outlook\u00a0is no easier to call for the US", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/1b1dfd_federal-reserve-board-chairman-jerome-powell-central-bank-do-it-takes-us-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
