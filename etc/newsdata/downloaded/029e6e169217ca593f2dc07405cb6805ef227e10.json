Both victims survived, although one - a 12-year-old girl - later had a leg amputated.\n\nIn response to those incidents, authorities culled six sharks in the area and controversially installed drum lines - baited hooks which are suspended underwater. The drum lines were later removed due to their impact on other marine life.\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Drones used to spot sharks on Australian beaches\n\nAt the time, experts said there was insufficient evidence to explain why the attacks had occurred in the same area. Sharks can be drawn by fishing activity or dirty water, and tend to be more active during dusk.\n\nUnprovoked shark attacks have injured 10 people in Australia this year, according to the Australian Shark Attack File.", "description": "The tourists suffer serious leg wounds in the attack at a popular holiday spot in Queensland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E2A8/production/_109442085_gettyimages-971880884.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
