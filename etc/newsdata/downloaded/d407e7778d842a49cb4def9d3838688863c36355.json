Peterson was fit but declared inactive against the Eagles, making him a healthy scratch for the first time in his 13-year career.\n\nWeek to week?\n\nWith players\u2019 availability being so fickle in the NFL \u2014 where a change of plans is always one play away \u2014 Peterson\u2019s odds of suiting up for the home opener improved exponentially by Monday. Turns out that starting halfback Derrius Guice has a right knee injury that could keep him out for multiple games.\n\nBut Guice\u2019s misfortune doesn\u2019t let Gruden off the hook for flagrant malpractice against Peterson.\n\nThat\u2019s not how you treat the eighth-leading rusher in NFL history. That\u2019s not how you handle a player who rushed for 1,042 yards last season and was the team\u2019s offensive MVP. That\u2019s not how you manage a position where the alternatives are unproven and/or injury-prone and/or pedestrian.\n\nGruden\u2019s three chosen halfbacks for the Eagles game were Guice, making his NFL debut; Chris Thompson, a fine third-down back; and Wendell Smallwood, a Sept. 1 pickup who also plays special teams. No offense to those gentlemen, but they didn\u2019t provide sufficient reason to keep Peterson in street clothes.\n\nPrior to Monday\u2019s news, Washington didn\u2019t have sufficient reason to keep Peterson on the roster, either, not if he presented the coach with a weekly struggle. Active or inactive? Judging by a derisive joke in the postgame news conference, Gruden\u2019s mind was set.\n\n\u201cIf we have a game where we think can run the ball 55 times in an I formation,\u201d Gruden said, \u201cthen sure, I\u2019ll get him up.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Gruden has coached Washington for 82 games. The team has topped 37 rushing attempts just four times; their high is 42 carries (accomplished twice). Gruden knows he\u2019ll never call 55 run plays, regardless of formation, essentially declaring that Peterson isn\u2019t needed.\n\nThat was then; this is awkward.\n\nIt seems clear which side Gruden took last week in the reported organizational debate on cutting Peterson. Having lost that argument, Gruden did the next-best thing to strike back against upper management: He made AP inactive.\n\nBut the coach failed to realize how much the move would sting players in the locker room, not just Peterson.\n\n\u201cAny time you\u2019ve got a Hall of Fame guy that doesn\u2019t dress, man, it\u2019s a slap in the face,\u201d offensive tackle Morgan Moses said Monday on 106.7 The Fan.\n\nThe coach had his reasons and they make sense in a vacuum. Guice is a better fit for Gruden\u2019s proclivities. Even with last season\u2019s success, Peterson\u2019s style as a north-south runner with limited pass-catching impact doesn\u2019t mesh well with the playbook. It\u2019s just that Guice\u2019s preseason injury last year created a forced marriage for Gruden and Peterson, and they made it work for the most part.\n\nAgainst the Eagles, Gruden opted for Smallwood\u2019s contributions on special teams over Peterson\u2019s potential contributions in the backfield. The latter was viewed as a redundancy. \u201cHe\u2019s a first/second-down back,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cAnd so is Derrius.\u201d\n\nNo matter what we think of Guice\u2019s upside, it\u2019s a leap to equate him with Peterson. And it was foolhardy to give Guice the feature role right away, especially without a safety net. Since leaving college two years ago, he had only 17 carries in two exhibition games.\n\nEveryone \u2014 including Peterson \u2014 foresaw Guice taking over. The process could\u2019ve been gradual, with Guice\u2019s workload growing steadily, beginning games on the sideline until eventually taking the field for the first possession. Having Peterson in uniform shouldn\u2019t be diametrically opposed to Washington\u2019s special teams needs. Figure it out.\n\nPeterson has earned the right to be a foundational piece, not a needless luxury.\n\nOn Monday, Gruden said he expects Peterson to \u201cplay and play well when he does play,\u201d noting that 15 games remain. He assured listeners that Peterson would be ready when called upon. Asked point-blank if he wants the halfback on the team, Gruden issued the only acceptable answer under the circumstances.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, yeah, for sure,\u201d Gruden said, though with little conviction. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want Adrian?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m thinking maybe a coach who isn\u2019t missing his starter and wouldn\u2019t call 55 runs in the I formation?\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
