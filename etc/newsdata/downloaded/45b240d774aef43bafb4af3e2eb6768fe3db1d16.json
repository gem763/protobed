That's thought to mean an unemployment rate of 4.5 per cent; unemployment is at 5.3 per cent, implying substantial accommodation is necessary.\n\nAustralian consumers are feeling worse despite the Reserve Bank's three interest rate cuts this year, the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index showed on Wednesday. It fell 5.5 per cent this month and measures sentiment at the lowest level since July 2015 as respondents downgrade their expectations for the economy over the next one and five years.\n\nMr Elliott, who defended the decision by ANZ and other major banks not to pass on the full 25 basis point rate cut last week by the Reserve Bank, said a summit could raise flags about banks being prohibited from discussing competitive issues, but that was not insurmountable.\n\n\u201cI'm an optimist and I understand there\u2019s risks and competition concerns and all that, but personally, I am a fan of roundtable sessions like that whether it's under the auspices of RBA or under the government or whatever,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Elliott said most participants in the economy would be willing to engage in a summit convened by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.\n\n\u201cI mean, one of the benefits of Australia, we can generally look outside and say, well, we can see what happened in the UK, we can see what's happened in Europe, we can see what's happening in the United States. Are there some lessons there?\u201d\n\nThe summit could analyse the role of banks in the economy and their need to earn profits to have the capital to keep lending.\n\nRole for banks\n\n\u201cThere is a debate at the moment about the question of whether banks are fulfilling their role as lenders.\n\n\u201cI think that could be thought about and what steps could be taken. Is there a credit crunch?\n\n\u201cThe regulators would have to be there as well. What could be done if we need easing up? How could you do that responsibly? Nobody wants to do it irresponsibly. What are some of the changes that you could do?\n\n\u201cI would have imagined that smart people sitting around the table with different sets of experiences and backgrounds could come up with some creative solutions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile QE \u2013 the process of printing money to buy bonds and suppress interest rates \u2013 has become more prolific since the financial crisis, no central bank has managed a clean exit. The US Federal Reserve is being dragged back to monetary stimulus and the European Central Bank has already promised to restart its bond buying to the tune of \u20ac20 billion ($32.6 billion) a month.\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell declared on Tuesday in Colorado that a pledge to inject liquidity to quell unease in the US repo market was not the equivalent of QE.\n\n\"I want to emphasise that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis,\" he said.\n\nMarkets demand stimulus\n\nHis clarification only served to rattle equity markets, which are anticipating greater monetary stimulus from the central bank to support asset prices, and were already rocked by the US State Department imposing visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for targeting Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province.\n\nQE was tacitly endorsed by the Bank for International Settlements earlier this week, with the acknowledgement that it is more effective when paired with fiscal policy. The BIS report was chaired by Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe. However, it also found that near-zero rates shrink bank profits, fuel the inefficient allocation of credit and weakens the private sector's incentive to deleverage.\n\nWall Street fell 1.2 per cent on Tuesday and the S&P/ASX 200 Index finished 0.7 per cent lower at 6546.7 points on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBank stocks fell during the session as the focus on margin compression within the sector intensifies. Commonwealth Bank fell 0.5 per cent to $78.18, Westpac 0.9 per cent to $28.43, National Australia Bank 0.1 per cent to $28.06 and ANZ 1.2 per cent to $27.09.\n\nMr Elliott said there was a pressing question about the impact of regulation on the economy and the banking system.\n\n\u201cI'm certainly not criticising the intention of any of the regulation \u2013 but I think we should ask whether there are some more thoughtful ways of implementing that at a lower cost?\n\n\u201cIt's all very well to say, well, when we regulate the banks, it comes at a cost to the banks. \u201cYes, that's true. But the cost is really borne by the community because either the shareholders are paying for it or our customers are paying for it.\u201d\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nHe said over-regulation in the United States from the Dodd Frank Act resulted in the bigger banks becoming more dominant in the financial system, and smaller banks losing market share.\n\n\u201cI'm not sure that was the intention \u2013 the intention of the legislation was not to make large banks even more dominant. That can be an unintended outcome of a lot of regulation.\n\nAustralia could end up with a more concentrated financial system, he warned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI'm not saying we will, I don't know because there are other factors at work here. But it's certainly something to consider.\u201d\n\nMr Elliott said the role of banks in the economy was worth debating.\n\n\"At the end of the day, despite what people might think about the banks, the banks have a role to play in the economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe do well when Australia does well. You know, there's actually an alignment of interest here.\u201d\n\nHe said as rates went lower in Australia, there was inevitably an intergenerational transfer of wealth.\n\n\u201cAs rates are falling, what you are actually doing is you are transferring wealth from those who have it \u2013 the savers, who are older Australians who are dependent on their savings for their income to borrowers, who are generally younger people who are buying a home.\n\n\u201cNow we can debate the rights and wrongs of it, but that's essentially what is happening as rates go lower.\u201d\n\nAustralia's relatively small size meant a summit could be an efficient way to generate ideas and have a \"constructive\" dialogue.\n\n\u201cWhile Australia is, on some scales, large and important, on another it's actually quite small. You wouldn't have to have a very big room or meeting table to have that meeting.\"", "description": "Shayne Elliott says the summit would be a chance to get representatives from the Treasury, the RBA, and banks together to discuss issues around zero per cent interest rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.433%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_730%2C$y_174/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/025abf2fcc14cdbc12b758e1f4dacad2bd2b5c4b", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
