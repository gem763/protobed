Other fans settled for fin slaps instead of high-fives. Through the mouth of this Katy Perry-esque \"Left Shark,\" Kucinich explained why he looked like he was celebrating Halloween a little too early at a baseball game: Nats reserve outfielder Gerardo Parra.\n\n\"I was like, \u2018Look, this guy is amazing. He\u2019s changing the culture of this team.\u2019\" Kucinich told USA TODAY Sports. \"I\u2019ve been watching since 2005, the whole time they\u2019ve been (in DC), and we\u2019re doing really, really well. We\u2019re so used to defeat. There\u2019s something different.\"\n\nIt starts with the looseness that is apparent in Washington's clubhouse and dugout, in large part to Parra's presence. Starting pitcher An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez said Parra, 32, began making a positive impact \"since the first moment that he stepped in the dugout.\"\n\nFINALLY:Washington Nationals put past failures behind them to reach World Series\n\n\"I remember in L.A., he made his first noise about, like, positive thoughts in the clubhouse,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"From that moment on, we try to bring \u2014 like try to have fun.\n\n\"This guy is unbelievable. He's funny, and he's happy, and he brings all the energy to the team. I'm glad to have this guy on the team.\"\n\nFun they have had, especially since the team recovered from a 19-31 start to the season. They won a thrilling wild card game and then slayed the mighty Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. Now they have the NL pennant.\n\nAll along, the dugout dancing parties after home runs hosted by Parra have become a staple of the team.\n\nThen there's \"Baby Shark\" \u2014 the popular children's song about a baby shark, a mommy shark and a daddy shark and a bunch of \"doo doo doos.\"\n\nParra used it as his walk-up song during a slump because his 2-year-old daughter \"loves that song,\" he told NBC Sports Washington. By mid-season, \"Baby Shark\" fever swept through Nationals Park. Fans clapped like the \"Gator Chomp\" while the song played over the loudspeakers. A baby shark appeared on the dugout railing as a quasi good-luck charm.\n\nIt's become a rallying cry and identity point during the franchise's first deep postseason run. The team's inclination for a good time has rubbed off on the fanbase.\n\n\"It\u2019s like, 'Hey, I believe,'\" Kucinich said. \"It really has to do with the culture. The guys are having fun.\"\n\nThe team's laid-back attitude is also a directive from the manager's office. Dave Martinez encourages the dancing \u2014 \"You ever seen Stephen Strasburg dance? It will make you laugh,\" he said \u2014 and he recognized the importance of letting Parra assume the role as leader of morale.\n\n\"I mean, it's tough to not have fun when he's around,\" Martinez said. \"He made a comment yesterday because he was on 'Intentional Talk.' The first thing he says, he goes, 'Man, I nailed it. My English was perfect. My name is no more Gerardo, it's Gerard.' You can't be serious. You've got to laugh at him, but he was dead serious. And he started going around the clubhouse saying, you call me Gerard from now on.\"\n\nBetween June 2-22, Parra was 2-for-30 with 11 strikeouts in five starts. Not only was Parra's hitting suffering, Martinez noticed, but his energy, too. As the Nats were finding their groove, they were losing in the morale department. So Martinez summoned the 10-year veteran to correct course.\n\n\"I said, 'Your job is to bring the energy every day. I don't care if you're 2-for-100. Bring the energy,'\" Martinez said. \"Play that music, get loud, and have fun.\"\n\nParra snapped out of it and the Nats continued their run. Kucinich got a photo with Parra and met some other members of the team after the wild card victory, the first time he donned the shark costume, which is now 2-0 lifetime.\n\n\u201cWhat else could you ask for?\u201d he said. \u201cI buy a $55 costume on Amazon and now I\u2019m meeting Parra, right?\u201d\n\nBaseball, after all, is a distraction for the masses.\n\n\"We're not here solving the world's problems,\" Martinez said. \"We're here playing a baseball game.\n\n\"I want (the players) to have fun. I want them to be loose.\"\n\nThe fans and the Nats prefer it that way.\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.", "description": "Washington Nationals outfielder Gerardo Parra's \"Baby Shark\" routine is a fan favorite.
