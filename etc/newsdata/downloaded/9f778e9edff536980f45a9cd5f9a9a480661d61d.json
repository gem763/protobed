She is believed to have been tortured and raped by al-Baghdadi himself until her death 18 months later.\n\nOn \"The Story,\" MacCallum asked Marsha Mueller how it has been for her family since the news of al-Baghdadi's death broke.\n\n\"This has been going on so long I'm not sure about the last 48 hours for me -- I'm just searching for Kayla -- I was glad he blew himself up, that no one killed him on our side,\" she said.\n\nShe explained while Kayla was held by ISIS, her captors would treat her worse than other prisoners because she was an American. Kayla was screamed at by British-born ISIS members known as \"The Beatles\" for all of what they believed the U.S. had done wrong, Marsha Mueller said.\n\nTRUMP RELEASES PHOTO OF HERO DOG INJURED IN AL-BAGHDADI RAID\n\n\"I think of other hostages and it seemed like she was treated much worse than the people she was with... because she was an American. So I\u2019m just glad he did it to himself.\"\n\nThe mission that killed al-Baghdadi in his hideout this weekend was named after Mueller, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said Sunday morning on \"Meet The Press.\"\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Gen. [Mark] Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did was named the operation that took down al-Baghdadi after Kayla Mueller, after what she had suffered,\u201d he said.\n\nMarsha Mueller praised Trump and the Special Operations forces who raided the compound, telling The Arizona Republic she believes if \u201cObama had been as decisive as Trump,\u201d her daughter might still be alive.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKayla Mueller's parents said on Sunday that they hope the ISIS leader's death will reveal more answers about what happened to their daughter. Even though they confirmed her death through pictures sent by militants, their daughter's body was never recovered.\n\nCarl Mueller reiterated that hope in his Monday interview.\n\n\"Our hope is to seize this moment,\" he said.\n\n\"This moment is the fact that Al-Baghdadi has been killed, some of his lieutenants have been captured and we are hoping they have the information we\u2019ve been seeking -- that is who killed Kayla, where was she killed and where was she buried.\"\n\nFox News' Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report.", "description": "The parents of murdered ISIS captive Kayla Mueller spoke to Fox News after President Trump\u00a0mentioning their daughter during his official announcement the terrorist group's leader was dead.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/MacCallum-Mueller-family.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
