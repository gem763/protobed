Dearborn Heights police are investigating the incident.\n\nSimilar to other viral challenges like the \"Tide Pod challenge\" or \"cinnamon challenge,\" the \"fire challenge\" is a dangerous internet trend. It usually involves people being doused in rubbing alcohol and lit on fire for a few seconds. The alcohol burns off quickly, and the fire is supposed to be extinguished in a bathtub or other water source.\n\nLast year, a then-12-year-old Detroit girl was burned on 49% of her body after attempting the challenge.\n\nA then-12-year-old boy from Spartanburg County, South Carolina, was burned on about 40% of his body after also attempting the challenge last year while home alone.\n\nSpartanburg Fire Marshal Brad Hall said at the time that the risk of injury goes up when rubbing alcohol gets on clothes because the fabric can ignite. The risk also increases when the alcohol is poured on the chest or near the face, which appears to have happened with the South Carolina boy, he said.\n\nChildren in Kentucky and California have also been injured in recent years while attempting the challenge.\n\nIn 2016, a similar challenge known as the \"fire spray challenge\" circulated online, showing teens spraying open flames with hairspray and other household items.\n\nWhile these stunts are dangerous, most kids are not engaging in them online, says Devorah Heitner, author of \"Screenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in Their Digital World.\"\n\n\"It could be that that kid is more isolated and has something to prove to peers,\" Heitner said of why a child might engage in a dangerous online trend.\n\nWhile in most cases, there is no need to worry unless you have a reason to think your child would be more susceptible to doing one of these stunts, Heitner says simply having a conversation with your kid about what they're watching online is a great way to check on them.\n\n\"Any kid could do something really dumb on a given day. But the fact is most kids aren't,\" she said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/04/fire-challenge-michigan-boy-treated-burns-social-media-stunt/3862622002/", "description": "The boy's mother told local TV that her son spent four days in the hospital after a friend sprayed him with nail polish remover and set him ablaze.", "authors": ["Emma Keith", "Ryan W.
