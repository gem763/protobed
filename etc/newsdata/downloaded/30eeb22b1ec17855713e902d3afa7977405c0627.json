But it\u2019s worth focusing on that exchange, because it was interesting \u2014 by which I mean depressing. CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, one of the moderators, asked a bad question, and the debaters by and large \u2014 with the perhaps surprising exception of Bernie Sanders \u2014 gave pretty bad answers.\n\nSo let me make a plea to the Democrats: Please don\u2019t go down the robot rabbit hole.\n\nBurnett declared that a recent study shows that \u201cabout a quarter of U.S. jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years.\u201d What the study actually says is less alarming: It finds that a quarter of U.S. jobs will face \u201chigh exposure to automation over the next several decades.\u201d\n\nBut if you think even that sounds bad, ask yourself the following question: When, in modern history, has something like that statement not been true?\n\nAfter all, in the late 1940s America had about seven million farmers and around 12 million production workers in manufacturing. Machinery could and did take over much of the work those Americans were doing \u2014 and people at the time wondered where the new jobs would come from. If you think that concerns about automation are somehow new, bear in mind that Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s novel \u201cPlayer Piano,\u201d envisioning a dystopian future in which machines have taken away all the jobs, was published in \u2026 1952.", "description": "The automation obsession is an escapist fantasy.", "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/opinion/17krugmanWeb/17krugmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
