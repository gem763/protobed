General Assembly on Tuesday that European nations pressuring the world to violate his nation\u2019s sovereignty in defense of the Amazon Rainforest were guilty of \u201ccolonialism\u201d and environmentalists were guilty of viewing indigenous Brazilians as \u201ccavemen.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro addressed an audience that included German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country he specifically identified as using as much as half of its territory for agriculture, threatening its natural ecosystem. He named France along with Germany in this assessment and, although he did not name French President Emmanuel Macron, he protested against attempts at this year\u2019s G-20 Summit to stage a global intervention on Brazil which were led by Macron.\n\n\u00cdntegra do discurso, abrindo a Assembl\u00e9ia Geral da ONU 2019. https://t.co/QPMGSh4uYu \u2014 Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) September 24, 2019\n\nMacron and Bolsonaro have an increasingly acrimonious relationship trigged by Macron accusing Bolsonaro of destroying the Amazon Rainforest. The relationship soured further then Bolsonaro replied to a supporters\u2019 insults against French First Lady Brigitte Macron by laughing.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations performed a key role in overcoming colonialism in the past,\u201d Bolsonaro said on Tuesday. \u201cIt must not allow this mindset to come back to its halls no matter what pretext.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro noted that in late August and September, early spring months in the Southern Hemisphere, fires are common in South America, both natural forest fires and artificial ones intended to clear land for farming. \u201cThere are forest fires that are part of the ordinary practice of indigenous peoples in the local populations as part of their culture,\u201d he noted. He described global coverage of the fires this year as \u201csensationalist attacks\u201d and directly rejected Macron\u2019s description of the Amazon Rainforest as \u201cthe lungs of the world\u201d as a \u201cfallacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese sensationalist attacks that we have suffered coming from a large part of the international media \u2026 have aroused our patriotic sentiment,\u201d Bolsonaro noted. \u201cIt is a fallacy to say that the Amazon is the heritage of humankind.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertain countries, instead of helping, embarked on the media lies and behaved in a disrespectful manner and a colonialist spirit,\u201d he noted.\n\nBolsonaro thanked American President Donald Trump personally for rejecting the \u201cabsurd proposal\u201d of sanctioning Brazil for environmental damage proposed at the G-20 summit by Macron and other European leaders.\n\n\u201cMy administration has solemnly committed itself to environmental preservation and sustainable development. \u2026\n\nBrazil is one of the world\u2019s richest countries in biodiversity and mineral resources; our Amazonian region is larger than all of Western Europe and remains pristine \u2026 we are one of the countries that most protects the environment,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cFrance and Germany use up more than 50 percent of their territories for agriculture. In contrast, Brazil uses no more than 8 percent,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201c61 percent of our territory is preserved.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro insisted that the Amazon Rainforest \u201cis not being devastated or consumed by fire\u201d and invited attendees to visit it personally to see the reality for themselves.\n\nBolsonaro also condemned \u201cradical extreme environmentalists \u2026 that are out of sync with what indigenous people truly want\u201d for attempting to combat attempted to help indigenous communities with economic development.\n\n\u201cOur natives are human beings just like any of us here. They want and they deserve to enjoy the same rights as all of us,\u201d he insisted, accusing environmentalists of having \u201cstubbornly insisted in keeping our indigenous people living like cavemen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe indigenous people do not want to be poor,\u201d Bolsonaro said.\n\nElsewhere in the speech, the Brazilian president celebrated that Brazil had returned \u201cfrom the brink of socialism\u201d and warned the world that leftist ideology brings with it only \u201ccruelty,\u201d death, and extreme poverty. He thanked God on several occasions for his life, noting that a socialist agitator had nearly stabbed him to death a year ago.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil told the U.N.
