Buckley Jr.", "language": "en", "text": "Buccola, a professor of political science at Linfield College, deftly guides the reader through the rhetorical and philosophical moves of Baldwin\u2019s speech. Baldwin adopted the tone of a preacher \u2014 \u201ca kind of Jeremiah,\u201d as he put it \u2014 who wants to readjust his audience\u2019s \u201csystem of reality.\u201d He tries to get them to imagine the black American experience from the inside. \u201cIt comes as a great shock to discover that Gary Cooper killing off the Indians \u2014 when you were rooting for Gary Cooper \u2014 that the Indians were you.\u201d Did the American dream come at the expense of the American Negro? For Baldwin, the obtuseness of the question demanded a pronoun switch: \u201cI am stating this very seriously, and this is not an overstatement, I picked the cotton, and I carried it to market, and I built the railroads, under someone else\u2019s whip, for nothing. For nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Fire Is Upon Us\u201d becomes revelatory in its interpretation of Buckley\u2019s performance. We learn, for instance, that the Cambridge students had first tried to get Strom Thurmond or Barry Goldwater to debate Baldwin, only later settling on Buckley, who seems to have been eager for the publicity. We also learn that Buckley\u2019s speech that evening was based on an article he had commissioned for National Review by Garry Wills. Wills, a young Catholic ultra, who would later break with Buckley over racial questions and become an indispensable interpreter of the American scene, drafted a fierce response to Baldwin\u2019s famous New Yorker essay, \u201cLetter From a Region in My Mind.\u201d Part of the trouble with Baldwin for Wills was that he was treated as a savior by his white liberal readership and not afforded the dignity of scrutiny that he would have received if he were white. Wills believed that Baldwin went too far in his condemnation of the West. \u201cWhen a Dachau happens,\u201d Wills wrote, \u201care we \u2014 as Baldwin suggests \u2014 to tear up all the Bibles, disband the police forces, take crowbars to the court buildings and the libraries?\u201d This was a selective reading of Baldwin, who, as his Cambridge speech makes clear, was if anything more committed to upholding the legacy of the Enlightenment than National Review\u2019s editorial board was. But what would come to gall Wills even more than Baldwin was that his boss Buckley not only lifted from his piece (before it was published) for one of his own columns but also distorted Wills\u2019s honest reckoning with Baldwin in the interest of his own, more facile and racialist prong of attack.\n\nBuccola shows how Buckley in his Cambridge speech was developing a new kind of conservative maneuver. In his war on the New Left, Buckley\u2019s method \u2014 both on his television show \u201cFiring Line\u201d and in other public appearances \u2014 was less to engage than to expose. (The method backfired on occasion, as when Huey Newton, a founder of the Black Panther Party, began a segment of \u201cFiring Line\u201d by out-Buckley-ing Buckley with a loyalty oath question: \u201cDuring the Revolution of 1776 \u2026 which side would you have been on?\u201d) Charm, wit, eye-twinkling and rapid deployment of stray factoids were among Buckley\u2019s chief rhetorical assets. His main form of reasoning consisted of forced analogies. The Freedom Riders were compared to National Socialists in the pages of National Review.", "description": "\u201cThe Fire Is Upon Us,\u201d by Nicholas Buccola, is at once a biography of two leading American intellectuals and an in-depth look at their legendary 1965 debate over civil rights.", "authors": ["Thomas Meaney"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/books/00MEANY-COMBO/00HEANY-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
