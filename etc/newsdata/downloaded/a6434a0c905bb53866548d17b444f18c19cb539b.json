The Friday demonstrations come more than six months after hundreds of thousands of students staged a similar coordinated effort to demand urgent action on climate change.\n\n\u2018Our future is what we are fighting for\u2019\n\nAmong the largest of the protests is the one in New York that will be led by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who testified before Congress this week that nations must take \u201cunprecedented\u201d actions to cut their carbon emissions in the next 10 years.\n\nTeen activist Greta Thunberg takes her youth climate campaign to Washington\n\n\u201cI am submitting this testimony because I don\u2019t want you to listen to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to listen to the scientists. And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take real action.\u201d\n\nU.S. takes a low profile as nations gather in New York to debate steps to combat climate change\n\nThe first wave of protests unfolded in Australia, where thousands of protesters of all ages urged their country, the world\u2019s biggest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas, to pursue a more significant policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. School Strike 4 Climate in Australia said that the more than 300,000 protesters on Friday represented the largest climate protest in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nSiobhan Sutton, a 15-year-old student at Perth Modern School, told the Associated Press that skipping school to attend a climate protest in Perth would result in her failing a math exam, but that it was worth it given what was at stake.\n\n\u201cI have basically been told that because it is not a valid reason to be missing school \u2014 it is not a medical reason or anything \u2014 I am going to get a zero on the test if I don\u2019t actually sit it,\u201d Siobhan, a protest organizer in Perth, told the AP. \u201cEven though we ourselves aren\u2019t sick, the planet which we live on is, and we are protesting and fighting for it.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, protests are planned in scores of cities up and down the country, from Belfast and Bournemouth to Edinburgh and Exeter. The biggest protests are expected in London, where the city\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he supported schools that were allowing children to skip lessons and lectures in order to take part in Friday\u2019s call for action. Demonstrations by schoolchildren and activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion, whose protest in London earlier this year led to more than 1,000 arrests, have helped to push the issue of climate change up to the top of the political agenda in the United Kingdom. In June, Britain pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, the first country in the Group of Seven to do so.\n\nBritain pledges to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050\n\nProtesters in climate-conscious Germany are planning more than 500 events to mark the global climate strike on Friday, including a large demonstration at Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate. The planned demonstrations in Germany come as Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government faces increasing public pressure to take bold climate actions following heat waves and Fridays for Future protests throughout the country.\n\nGermany\u2019s governing parties are holding a special meeting on Friday to finalize and unveil a new climate protection package.\n\nIn Moscow, Arshak Makichyan, a 24-year-old violinist who says he was inspired by Thunberg, staged a one-man protest after the government rejected his application to hold a group demonstration, the BBC reported. \u201cI thought climate change was just science, but Greta had the right words to explain why it should worry all of us,\u201d he said. Russia, which has been hit hard by climate change, ranks as the world\u2019s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, the United States and India.\n\nIn New York, organizer Olivia Wohlgemuth took to the subways in a last-minute effort to recruit protesters Thursday night, handing out fliers on a Brooklyn-bound train and urging people to attend Friday\u2019s rally near City Hall.\n\n\u201cThis is the most important issue of our time,\u201d said Wohlgemuth, a high school senior and activist. \u201cWe need you to join us.\u201d Most of the passengers looked away, but a boy with a large backpack took off his headphones to listen and accepted a flier when she handed it to him. New York City Public Schools announced this week that students who skipped school to attend the strike would be granted an excused absence.\n\nWhen the train pulled into the next station, Olivia dashed through the doors and into the next car.\n\nKaplan and Dennis reported from New York.
