Rand Paul (R-KY) called rising support for socialism among youth in America \u201cmind-boggling,\u201d in a recent exclusive interview with Breitbart News on his new book The Case Against Socialism.\n\nPaul, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate and prominent libertarian, said he remembers in the 1970s and 1980s when Americans would never admit to being socialists, let alone a liberal. Today, he said, Democrats are openly running on socialist platforms, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling, actually,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe now live in a time where not only are people talking about socialism, they\u2019re proudly running as a socialist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for this generation to realize what socialism was in the last century and how [it] really invariably was associated with violence, with genocide, with famine, with horrible tragedy and you know, today\u2019s youth seems to have forgotten that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said in China, as many as 40 million died during the Great Famine in the late 1950s, and today, in Venezuela, people are eating their pets.\n\n\u201cThat is the end result of socialism, there is no food in the stores,\u201d he said. \u201cVenezuela has more oil than any other country in the world, they have more oil than Saudi Arabia, they were one of the richest countries, and now they\u2019re in calamitous poverty.\u201d\n\nHis book tells the story of a young woman in Venezuela in a gang that controls territory \u2014 six dumpsters where they can search for food.\n\n\u201cHow did they get there? It\u2019s almost, it\u2019s mind-boggling. How do you even explain it?\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he does not think America is ready for socialism, but pointed out that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u2014 who does not call herself a socialist but is running on socialist policies \u2014 appears to be the Democrat frontrunner.\n\n\u201cThe socialist doesn\u2019t win, but the person who has all the same policies who doesn\u2019t call herself a socialist, Elizabeth Warren, and right now is looking like the frontrunner, but she\u2019s for most of the policies that Bernie Sanders is for and so that will be the question, will we elect someone with socialist policies?\u201d he said.\n\nPaul debunked the myth that there is socialism in Scandinavia.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not socialist in Scandinavia. They have private property, they have a private stock market, they don\u2019t even have a minimum wage, prices go up and down, but they do have a big welfare state. So while they\u2019re not socialist they have a big welfare state. They do have free college, free paid leave, all these sort of welfare goodies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt turns out in Scandinavia, the way they pay for free college and all this so-called free stuff is they tax the working class, and the middle class, extensively, so there\u2019s a 25 percent sales tax, they call it a VAT, it\u2019s on food, clothing, everything, you name it. Twenty-five percent so everybody pays that, including the poor. So that\u2019s a pretty significant tax \u2014 25 percent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey also have an income tax that\u2019s 60 percent starting at $60,000. That\u2019s way higher than the United States. So the dirty little secret of Scandinavia is you can have a welfare state but everybody\u2019s got to pay taxes,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said back in the U.S., Warren is promising Medicare-for-all without saying whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it.\n\n\u201cShe won\u2019t answer the question. Now Bernie has, he said we\u2019ll raise taxes on the middle class but they\u2019ll save money on their healthcare cause it\u2019ll be \u2018free,'\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell Elizabeth Warren won\u2019t answer that question, I think that\u2019s going to be an important question for her, and we\u2019ll see, and even the left and the establishment media and the left are going, \u2018Elizabeth, how are you going to pay for this?\u2019 and I think she\u2019s boxed in a corner and eventually she\u2019s going to have to admit \u2014 with massive middle class taxes.\u201d\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Paul called rising support for socialism among youth in America \"mind-boggling\" in a recent interview\u00a0on his new book.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/rand-paul-rips-republicans-border-emergency-bryan-woolston-ap-photo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
