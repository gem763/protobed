Since then, developer Hello Games has ceaselessly tweaked the experience and released two major downloadable updates, Next and Beyond. Now, the whole package is available as a physical release for the PlayStation 4, providing the ultimate version of one of the most ambitious titles of the modern era, which also happens to be a wonderful showcase for the console\u2019s virtual reality capabilities.\n\nPlaying No Man\u2019s Sky Beyond with a VR headset (a feature also accessible on the PC version via Oculus Rift, Vive and other headsets) is an almost mystical experience. Standing on an alien world, watching as the branches of strange flora rustle in the breeze and starships fly in formation overhead is utterly beguiling and transporting, while maintaining a true sense of physical presence. Holographic menus pop up on your HUD, indicating notable mineral deposits and undiscovered creatures, and if you\u2019re using the PlayStation Move controllers you get a wonderfully physical interface for the game\u2019s crucial mining laser.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest No Man\u2019s Sky Beyond in VR \u2026 a wondrous feeling of extraterrestrial presence. Photograph: Hello Games\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, however. The screen resolution is lower and you have to adjust to the sometimes slightly blurred patina the VR display casts over everything. Also, the point-and-teleport movement system, default if you\u2019re using a Dualshock controller, may take a few minutes to get used to, but at least it drastically cuts down on any sort of motion sickness that might come from fully free-body movement. These issues are much less obvious once you get into space and see the stars and planets around your cockpit. It is a revelation.\n\nBeyond also adds to all other aspects of the No Man\u2019s Sky offering, enhancing the multiplayer component allowing you to easily meet, trade with and assist other players on their missions, and greatly improving the structure and sense of the narrative strands, so you understand what you\u2019re doing out there in space following clues toward the mysterious Atlas. The game feels more populated with non-player characters too, the space stations crowded with travellers rather than empty and echoing.\n\nAt its core, No Man\u2019s Sky Beyond is still the same poetic unconventional space game it always was \u2013 you can drift from world to world, exploring alone, watching weird beasts trawl the orange plains as planets swirl in the night sky. You don\u2019t have to interact with anything or anyone. But all the systems, from the inventory screens, to the missions briefings, have been perfected to support rather than frustrate you in your career as an interstellar wanderer. Doing these things within virtual reality has been something of a gift to me, a kid of the original Star Wars generation. It is a childhood fantasy somewhat realised.\n\nSony has sold millions of its PlayStation VR headsets and until now it\u2019s been tough to recommend one experience as a killer app. Soulful, technically proficient and at times almost tearfully beautiful, No Man\u2019s Sky Beyond is as close as we\u2019ll get.", "description": "As a Star Wars generation kid, the VR experience of this almost made me tearful: it\u2019s beguiling and transporting", "authors": ["Keith Stuart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72b810d21070eb35aa401794c7c9f0d0cb03ed57/379_0_2228_1338/master/2228.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f10e431b375563d5d2ffecaf46c9c470", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
