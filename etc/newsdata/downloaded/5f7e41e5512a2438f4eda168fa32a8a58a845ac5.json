There is the sharp crack of automatic rifle fire, with all the shots being supposedly fired into the air.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Groups of youths are trying to block the motorways as the authorities struggle to retain control.\n\nIf the Iraqi government had made a plan at the beginning of this week to turn sparsely attended demonstrations against corruption and lack of jobs into a mass movement, then it is doing very nicely.\n\nProtesters walking towards the Green Zone, the location of much of the government, were met on Tuesday night with hot water jets, teargas, rubber bullets and live fire.\n\nThe government claims that only two people were killed and several hundred injured, though hospital doctors, who treated the injured, say that the real figure is much higher.\n\n\u201cWe were caught by surprise by the toughness of the security services\u2019 response to a peaceful demonstration,\u201d says Haider, who trained as lawyer and has helped organise the demonstrations against joblessness \u2013 particularly among graduates of whom 307,000 are unemployed \u2013 for the last three months.\n\nThe protests had not been getting much traction until the police and army violently attacked protesters on Tuesday, saying that they were under orders to defend the Green Zone at all costs.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

All the airline offices on Sadoon Street are closed, as are the clinics in Al Nidal Street.\n\nThe traffic is very limited by Baghdad standards and there are not many pedestrians to be seen. Municipal workers had cleaned up Tahrir Square overnight, spraying the street with water while bulldozers removed rubbish. As they did so, a car was distributing water to protesters and soldiers alike.\n\n\u201cWe are not against you, you are our brothers,\u201d one activist told a soldier as he offered him a cold bottle of water.\n\nIn Zaafaraniya, southeast of Baghdad, at least five people were treated for shortness of breath after police used teargas to break up a small protest. Police also used teargas in al-Shaab, north of Baghdad. Security officials said five people were arrested in al-Shaab and three in Zaafaraniya.\n\nThe protests are the most serious challenge against Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s government since it was formed nearly a year ago. It had got through the height of the summer, when the shortage of electricity for air conditioning causes intense popular rage, without major protests along the lines of those that paralysed Basra in 2018 and led to the fall of the previous prime minister.\n\nThe demonstrations and marches had been tame and their leaders wanted to avoid being identified with any political party. The followers of the populist nationalist cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr, were asked not to take part. Using social media to coordinate, people rallied against corruption and lack of basic services, with university students in particular complaining that their academic credentials did not help them get jobs.\n\nSimilar protests and confrontations took place in other provinces, including in the cities of Basra and Nasiriyah in the south. In Nasiriyah, one protester was killed and around 20 people wounded, according to hospital officials.\n\nWhat is significant here is that all the protests are in Shia provinces, which is important in a country that has a Shia majority and a predominantly Shia government.\n\nThe problem is that the government is corrupt at every level and the allocation of jobs in ministries \u2013 and jobs within them \u2013 depends on party allegiance and religious affiliation. This system has gelled since the new government system was introduced after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and will be near impossible to reform.", "description": "A man is lying dead or injured on the pavement beside a road leading into Tahrir Square in the centre of Baghdad.
