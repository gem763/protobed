We'd love to see you there.\n\nLeah, Alex and Steph will all be at the show speaking on a range of panels, covering all the hottest topics like which video game cryptids are the hottest and asking just how plausible robot bees are. Here's where you can catch us throughout PAX.\n\nSaturday\n\nFor the Horde! \u2014 10:30am-12pm, Wombat Theatre\n\nJoin Steph, PandaTV and others as they undergo a gruelling dungeon run in World of Warcraft.\n\nPandaTV and 3 friends will run through World of Warcraft dungeons live and on stage. But they\u2019ll do it IN CHARACTER. And your donations to charity will drive their choices. AND THEN we\u2019ll cut it into a low-budget movie. It\u2019ll be classic.\n\nToo Much Isn't Enough: Reviewing the Tech of Black Mirror \u2014 1:30pm-2:30pm, Kookaburra Theatre\n\nJoin Alex, Rae Johnston of Junkee and Fergus Halliday of PC World for an exploration into Black Mirror's darkest tech.\n\nRobot bees, computer generated retirement homes and murderous robot dogs. Charlie Brooker\u2019s twisted Black Mirror has no shortage of tech gone wild. The science fiction anthology series has even invented a few video games over the course of its five season run. Join us as we rank and review our favorite gadget and games featured in the series and weigh in on whether or not we\u2019d ignore the obvious red flags and buy them anyway.\n\nHell Kitchen LIVE \u2014 2pm-3pm, Wombat Theatre\n\nWatch as Steph attempts to use her limited cooking skills to cook up a dish most spicy.\n\nIs there such a thing as TOO spicy? The GenerOZity team do not think so. Join them, along with some familiar faces, as they embark upon the most hellish challenge there is: cooking spicy food in front of a live audience. The aim is to make food so inedibly hot that the panel of judges wish they were being eviscerated by the DOOM Slayer himself in hell. Winner takes all (including a very spicy DOOM themed trophy). Loser has to eat the leftovers.\n\nWhich Video Game Cryptid Would Make The Best Lover? \u2014 9pm-10pm, Galah Theatre\n\nJoin Leah, Steph, Nicole Archer of CNET and Dan Crowd (man, formerly of IGN) as they break down the tenderest lovers in the cryptid world, and pick their favourites.\n\nVideo games are filled with a variety of strong and independent cryptids, from Bigfoot to Mothman and even the Jersey Devil. We\u2019re here to ask the age old question - which cryptid would make the best lover? Does Bigfoot REALLY like big feet? And just what does the Goatman use those horns for? All your sexy cryptid questions will be answered in this panel from young upstarts Leah, Nicole and Steph - as well as their resident male friend, Dan Crowd.\n\n\"Pet\", Marry, Kill: Pok\u00e9mon Edition \u2014 11am-12pm, GameSpot Theatre\n\nJoin Leah, as well as Daniel Van Boom, Nicole Archer and Jackson Ryan from CNET, as well as Dan Crowd, for a talk that'll put the \"freak\" in Game Freak. This panel will be livestreamed, and we'll update with the link to view it as soon as we have it.\n\nThere\u2019s one thing we can all agree on\u2014there are too many damn Pok\u00e9mon. You know it, we know it, Nintendo and Game Freak know it. So what better way to spend an hour of PAX killing off a good chunk of the 800+ strong Pok\u00e9dex and making sure we celebrate our favourites in our own, uh, special way?\n\nSpeedrun Everything \u2014 3:30pm-4:30pm, Wombat Theatre\n\nSteph will be hosting this unique take on speedrunning, which seems like it'll be a hectic, fun time.\n\nLights, Camera, Speedrun! What\u2019s the action packed panel at PAX going to be this year? I\u2019ll give you a hint but you need to figure it out fast. Teams of Australian cosplayers, musicians, and artists will be competing to create the best example of their work that they can\u2026 using only the tools and materials given to them within a very strict time window! The panellists will be judged on creativity, mouthfeel, and resourcefulness by the audience.\n\nIf you see us on the show floor at PAX, feel free to say hey! We're all pals here, and it's always lovely to see the power that video games has to bring us all together.\n\nWe'll see you on the show floor.", "description": "We've all been waiting for it, and now it's finally upon us \u2014 it's PAX week, and the Kotaku Australia team will be on the ground and strutting our stuff over the entire weekend!
