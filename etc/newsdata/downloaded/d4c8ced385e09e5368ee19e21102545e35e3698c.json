(Both Edmonds and Wilson have vehemently denied having an affair.)\n\nShe began by discussing her pain over Jim\u2019s sexting scandal in June, when he admitted that he \u201cengaged in an inappropriate conversation\u201d and exchanged \u201clewd photos\u201d with another woman \u2014 not the nanny \u2014 but denied having a physical relationship with her.\n\n\u201cOut of respect for my children and my family, I find it unnecessary to go into all the gritty details. What I will say is that, in the wake of the sexting situation, my husband was drinking and partying with much younger women, including several of our babysitters, and I found this galavanting inappropriate, immature, and downright odd,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile I initially wrote it off because during several of these outings, his 22-year-old daughter was present, given his previous indiscretions, I was uncomfortable,\u201d she continued. \u201cEven more so when he started lying about where he was going or who he was going with\u2014and deleting entire text conversations on his phone with several of these young women. (For the record, after the sexting affair he had agreed with our therapist that he would be totally transparent and never delete messages or conversations and he would also keep his location available on his phone.)\u201d\n\nView photos Meghan King Edmonds/Instagram More\n\nKing Edmonds then references a widely circulated photo of her husband and the nanny attending a hockey game together.\n\n\u201cAnd when I learned of a particular outing with a babysitter, this time, to a hockey game, that Jim repeatedly lied about, I asked him to include me on all future texts with this sitter but he said, \u2018No.\u2019 Another major red flag,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be clear, I don\u2019t know if Jim slept with our babysitter or whether they were just being exceedingly inappropriate by hanging out socially without either of them telling me (and Jim expressly lying to me about it). I\u2019ve gone back and forth with my thoughts for a couple days but as I write this, I don\u2019t think he did. But I still don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d lie. And why would she lie?\u201d\n\nShe then recounts hearing from a reporter out of the blue that a story would soon be published about Edmonds filing for divorce. \u201cThis is the first I had heard of it. Ten minutes later it was all over the world wide web,\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED: Jim Edmonds\u2019 Daughter Slams Meghan King Edmonds, Defends Nanny: \u2018The Selfishness Is Miserable\u2019\u200b\n\nShe noted that there is no record of the divorce filing: \u201cHow did this tabloid have so much personal information? How did it know Jim had filed for divorce? Information that \u2013 to my knowledge \u2013 only Jim and his lawyer were privy to. Once again, the tabloids knew more about my marriage than I did.\u201d\n\nKing Edmonds said she mostly grieves for the couple\u2019s young children: twin sons Hayes and Hart, 16 months, and daughter Aspen, 3 next month.\n\n\u201cI am broken for my family. I am buried in despair. I cry at the drop of a hat. But I am enduring. I will set an example for my children and I will teach them to love and respect people while also knowing how to condone unethical or wrong behavior. I will facilitate healthy, consistent, and ongoing relationships with their father and with his family despite the hurt I feel from them because my children should not reap the karma of my personal situations.\u201d she wrote.", "description": "Meghan King Edmonds Breaks Silence on Husband's Alleged Affair", "authors": ["Eric Todisco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/99uVZImRhwQfUDvaPAX.HA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/c033ff9f2f8782525c1957af027f9d14", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
