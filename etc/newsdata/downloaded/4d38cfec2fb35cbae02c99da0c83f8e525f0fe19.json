At 3-3, the team is third in the NFC West and a game back of the second wild-card spot.\n\nPerhaps the Rams simply want to shake up a secondary that's allowing 241.3 yards per game and ranks 20th in pass defense DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average), per Football Outsiders. General manager Les Snead might also be clearing the deck for a larger move prior to the Oct. 29 trade deadline.\n\nThe trade comes off as a harsh assessment of Peters, who was a Pro Bowler in his first two years and an All-Pro in 2016.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Reference, Young appeared in more than 50 percent of the Ravens' defensive snaps once in five weeks. The 2018 fourth-round draft pick played a limited role in Baltimore's defense.\n\nGiven the cost they paid, Peters is worth the gamble for the Ravens. The 26-year-old is now on his third team since entering the league in 2015, which isn't encouraging. His production speaks for itself, however.\n\nPeters should help a defense that's giving up eighth-most passing yards (269.5 per game) in the NFL.\n\nThe Ravens will have the rest of the season to determine whether they want to offer Peters an extension or use the franchise tag on him in the offseason as he plays out the final year of his rookie deal.", "description": "The Los Angeles Rams traded cornerback  Marcus Peters  to the Baltimore Ravens for linebacker Kenny Young and an undisclosed 2020 draft pick on Tuesday, the team  announced ...", "authors": ["Joseph Zucker"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/833/249/hi-res-b300e5c8a879ce359da68cf18de878b0_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
