The music selection is also filtered so songs won\u2019t have explicit content.\n\nThe launch is a first in the online music streaming space, where kids on parents\u2019 music plans typically sign in through the same app \u2014 just with a different login. But Spotify believes children deserve their own space, where the music they listen to is available in an ad-free environment, where they won\u2019t accidentally encounter lyrics that parents disapprove of, and where content is hand-curated by editors.\n\nSpotify Kids, essentially, is a set of hand-picked playlists across categories.\n\nThese span categories like Movies & TV, top hits, Activities (bedtime, homework, playtime, etc.), genres, seasonal, Spotify Originals, artist/groups and Stories.\n\nThese playlists are all programmed by human editors, not algorithms, who follow a set of guidelines about what\u2019s appropriate for children.\n\nThe editors, Spotify says, have backgrounds from some of the most well-known brands in the children\u2019s entertainment market, including Nickelodeon, Disney, Discovery Kids, Universal Pictures, Public Service (Sweden) and BookBeat (family and kids-oriented audio streaming service).\n\nThe app isn\u2019t just for the preschool set. Instead, it can grow with the kids as they get older \u2014 but still aren\u2019t ready for the parents\u2019 application yet.\n\nIn the younger kids\u2019 version, children can listen to things like singalongs, lullabies, and soundtracks aimed at little kids. Older users have access to tracks and playlists of their own, including some popular tracks, that are appropriate and relevant for their age group. Parents will select the appropriate age group upon launch.\n\nIn time, Spotify will expand the app with more content and build enhanced parental settings and controls that allow parents to customize the kids app further.\n\nThe app also looks nothing like the main app \u2014 it\u2019s colorful and bright, and has a look and feel that varies by the kids\u2019 age group. For example, the younger kids see artwork that\u2019s softer and character-based, while older kids have a more detailed experience.\n\n\u201cSpotify is committed to giving billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by music and stories and we\u2019re proud that this commitment now includes the next generation of audio listeners,\u201d said Spotify\u2019s Chief Premium Business Officer Alex Norstr\u00f6m. \u201cWe are excited to be expanding the Spotify Premium Family experience with a dedicated app just for our youngest fans. Spotify Kids is a personalized world bursting with sound, shape and color, where our young listeners can begin a lifelong love of music and stories.\u201d\n\nThe app is initially available in beta, while Spotify works to refine the experience based on additional insights gained from use as well as parents\u2019 feedback. It requires a Premium Family plan to use.\n\nSpotify Kids is available today in Ireland on iOS and Android, but is rolling out to all markets, the company confirms.", "description": "In a move to boost family subscriptions to its app, Spotify this morning announced the launch of a dedicated Kids application which allows children three and up to listen to their own music, both online and offline, as well as explore playlists and recommendations picked by experts, and more.
