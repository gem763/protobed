Friday is the most likely target date, sources say. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 18, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRamsey is one of the league's best cornerbacks, and Pro Football Focus ranked him No. 2 at the position (behind New England Patriots star Stephon Gilmore) entering the 2019 season. He's also just 24 years old.\n\nThere are several teams that should consider making a play for Ramsey.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs come to mind pretty quickly. KC's pass defense was the reason it failed to beat the New England Patriots in last season's AFC Championship Game. Although the Chiefs defense as a whole improved over the offseason with the additions of Frank Clark and Tyrann Mathieu, it's probably still not talented or deep enough to slow down a Patriots passing attack that just added an elite wide receiver in Antonio Brown.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Patriots don't really need Ramsey. They have a shutdown cornerback in Stephon Gilmore, and the rest of the secondary is loaded with top-tier talent and impressive depth. That said, they didn't need to sign Brown, either, and if the Patriots really want to load up their roster to maximize the rest of Tom Brady's career, a move for Ramsey makes some sense. Acquiring Ramsey also would provent him from improving the defense of a rival.\n\nA couple other contenders that could use an upgrade at cornerback include the Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Chargers, Seattle Seahawks and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nRamsey is an elite player and doesn't have a huge salary because he's still on his rookie contract, so there's no excuse for the Jaguars not to acquire an impressive package of draft picks and/or players if they do decide to trade the star cornerback.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
