He was allegedly denied entry, though, citing loyalty to the Gracie family name.\n\nGracie said the situation paints a bigger picture about loyalty. He said Swanson should have stuck to his original training group, and that attempting to seek a spot on mats elsewhere is not something he believes in.\n\n\u201cThe way I grew up in training and fighting martial arts is basically you have a clan and a team and you\u2019re with your team forever,\u201d Gracie told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at UFC on ESPN+ 19 open workouts. \u201cIf you leave your team you\u2019re traitor. That\u2019s the way I grew up. I have this instilled in me and no matter what\u2019s going on with me or my team that\u2019s my team. I don\u2019t do get to just pick and choose as I go along with this career, whether it\u2019s jiu-jitsu or whether it\u2019s fighting. In the old times of war you had a clan and you can\u2019t just go, \u2018I didn\u2019t like this clan this time I\u2019m going to go somewhere else.\u2019\n\n\u201cI think in modern-day right now you tell me something like that it\u2019s like, \u2018Duh.\u2019 I want to know what gym told him not to,\u201d Gracie continued. I saw him have a photo with a jiu-jitsu gym that was. He didn\u2019t have his jiu-jitsu already set up? He doesn\u2019t have his team set up? He\u2019s been fighting for 15 years and doesn\u2019t have these resources already? It doesn\u2019t make any sense to me that this happened now.\u201d\n\nThe fight marks Gracie\u2019s second UFC appearances after making his debut with a submission of Alex Caceres nine months ago. He said he wanted back sooner, but this is how the situation unfolded.\n\nGracie said it was worth the wait, though, because he gets to fight one of the more successful 145-pound fighters in UFC/WEC history. Swanson may be on a four-fight skid currently, but Gracie said it\u2019s an opportunity prove himself against a well-established foe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful I get to test myself against Cub,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cI know he\u2019s lost a few fights but he\u2019s a top opponent and he\u2019s only lost to top guys. It\u2019s going to be a good test.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena. The entire card streams on ESPN+.\n\nTo hear more from Gracie, watch the video above.", "description": "Kron Gracie doesn't see any issues with Cub Swanson being disallowed in Gracie jiu-jitsu gyms ahead of UFC on ESPN+ 19.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kron-gracie-ufc-tampa-open-workout-scrum.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
