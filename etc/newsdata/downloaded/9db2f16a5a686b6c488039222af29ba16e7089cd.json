Corefco has been blacklisted since 1995, it added.\n\nA GE spokeswoman said the Canadian customer was Sherritt International Corp. and GE has terminated the relationship.\n\nA spokesman for Sherritt declined to comment. Corefco couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nThe Treasury said GE discovered the alleged violations during testing and auditing of its compliance program and disclosed the violations to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces U.S. economic sanctions. The agency, which is part of the Treasury Department, also credited GE for implementing remedial measures, including developing a training video for employees using the alleged violations as a case study.\n\nThe GE spokeswoman said the company sold water-treatment equipment and provided services to Sherritt from 2010 to 2014.\n\nSherritt said in a 2016 annual report that it owned 50% of Corefco, which is based in Alberta, Canada.\n\nThe Treasury said GE\u2019s subsidiaries failed to treat its Canadian customer as higher-risk, and maintained and renewed the relationship despite the customer\u2019s strong ties to Cuba\u2019s mining industry.\n\nGE\u2019s subsidiaries sent all of their invoices to the Canadian customer, but allegedly received payments from Corefco that accounted for more than 65% of the total transactions from at least 2010 to 2014, according to the Treasury. GE\u2019s subsidiaries approved Corefco as a third-party payer and its sanctions-screening software didn\u2019t raise red flags, the Treasury said.\n\n\u201cWe corrected the process years ago,\u201d the GE spokeswoman said.\n\nWrite to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com", "description": "The conglomerate agreed to pay more than $2.7 million to settle allegations that its subsidiaries violated U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba through a former customer, the Treasury Department said.", "authors": ["Mengqi Sun", "Mengqi.Sun Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-112743/social", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
