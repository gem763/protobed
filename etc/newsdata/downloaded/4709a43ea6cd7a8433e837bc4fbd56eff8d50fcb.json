But, despite health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s assurances that it would be available on the NHS within several months, there has not been a prescription for full-extract cannabis oil on the NHS reported since its legalisation. Doctors have effectively been blocked from prescribing it due to a lack of clinical evidence.\n\nNow, it can be disclosed that then junior health minister Seema Kennedy appeared to suggest to a mother that she could flout the law by buying medical cannabis overseas and bringing it into the UK without a licence, which would be illegal.\n\nJoanne Griffiths, whose son Ben\u2019s seizures fell from 100 a day to 10 after he began taking medical cannabis at a cost of about \u00a36,000 a month under private prescription, says that, at an event with Kennedy in June, she voiced her concerns over potentially criminalising herself. But she says Kennedy appeared to dismiss her anxieties, and seemed to suggest she should go ahead.\n\nHe would go back to hundreds of seizures a day, suffering horrific injuries and probably die Joanne Griffiths, mother\n\nAsked whether Kennedy, now the immigration minister, stood by her comments, a government spokesperson said: \u201cThe minister is clear that at no point did she advocate for her constituent to break the law and fully endorses the government policy. It is unlawful to import cannabis-based products for medicinal use to the UK without a Home Office importation licence.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to a recording passed to the Observer, Kennedy told Griffiths that bringing the products into the country was one of her options. \u201cSo the options, I guess, open are import licence, what else [sic] options? Go and travel or get somebody to travel and bring it in,\u201d said Kennedy.\n\nIn April, medical cannabis confiscated at an airport from Emma Appleby \u2013 whose nine-year-old daughter Teagan has Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which can cause up to 300 seizures a day \u2013 was returned by the department of health after about a week. When Griffiths raised her concerns, Kennedy is heard saying: \u201cWell, you say that, and of course, I suppose strictly speaking, but I think with \u2013 I can\u2019t remember Teagan\u2019s mum\u2019s name \u2013 they were released quite quickly, weren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nGriffiths, who is one of a number of parents lobbying the government for wider access to medical cannabis, said that she had told Kennedy she would record their conversations. But the MP was unaware she was being recorded. Griffiths, whose application for an import licence was later rejected, went abroad and returned with the medicine without informing border guards. She said she did this because she feared her son \u2013 who has such severe epilepsy that he often wears a helmet \u2013 would die if he could not have the medicine.\n\n\u201cHe would go back to hundreds of seizures a day, suffering horrific injuries and probably die,\u201d Griffiths told the Observer. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality of it. That amount of seizures does irreparable damage to his brain.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joanne Griffiths and son Ben, whose seizures are so bad that he has to wear a protective helmet.

A number of families have threatened to go on hunger strike, and to camp outside 10 Downing Street, if free access is not widened by 1 November.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not prepared to wait any more,\u201d said Griffiths. \u201cWe need urgent intervention now, but the authorities are failing us on every single level. I\u2019ll hunger strike for as long as it takes, until our children get the medicine they need.\u201d\n\nSNP MP Ronnie Cowan, the vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on medical cannabis under prescription, said that Kennedy\u2019s remarks showed that she understood how parents were being forced into illegal situations, and urged her to help make medical cannabis free on the NHS as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cFor many people this is a matter of life or death,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cThey should not be fobbed off with faint promises or encouraged to break the law.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Boris Johnson was asked by Cowan when children suffering from epilepsy would be able to access medical cannabis legally and at no cost.\n\nIn his response, the prime minister did not refer to prescriptions of cannabis-based medicines such as Sativex and Epidiolex, which have been provided to patients but are said not to be as effective as full-extract oil, which has a higher THC content \u2013 the psychoactive component of cannabis.\n\nHe told the House of Commons he understood that people in need of medical cannabis were going through \u201cdesperate difficulties\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe chief medical officer and NHS England have made it clear that cannabis-based products can be prescribed for medicinal use. It must be up to doctors to decide when it is in the best interests of their patients to do so,\u201d he said, before appearing to offer a meeting to provide further reassurances.\n\nHowever, Griffiths gave his remarks short shrift and said the prime minister had yet to respond to campaigners\u2019 letters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re standing up in parliament and saying clinicians can prescribe, but the NHS trusts are not allowing it. This is why we\u2019re being forced to do a hunger strike to bring this to Boris Johnson\u2019s attention for him to urgently intervene.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Kennedy, MP for South Ribble, announced she would stand down at the next general election. The mother of three said she would be focussing on other priorities in her life.", "description": "Seema Kennedy denies saying bringing drug into UK was an \u2018option\u2019", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/510a7b1fb8c0ae4aa3a96ea86b4358cb1aa7fff6/0_436_3796_2277/master/3796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3faa7ee48560fbfa70f8cb4c408af055", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
