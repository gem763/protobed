That's how it should be, since Whitaker has been sick on his other birthdays, battling stage 4 neuroblastoma.\n\nHe's stable now, so his parents Seth and Erin wanted to make this birthday special.\n\n\"He had been telling us, I just want 100 Bumblebees for my birthday,\" Seth Weinburger said.\n\nBumblebees, as in Bumblebee the Transformer from the movies. Every time he sees a yellow car, he thinks it's the character.\n\nSo, Erin put out the word on social media and hundreds of yellow cars flooded their Alexandria, Virginia, neighborhood before dawn. It seemed like the whole neighborhood walked with Whitaker alongside those yellow cars more than a mile to his school.\n\nHis long-term prognosis is uncertain. But what is certain, it was a day for a superhero.", "description": "Whitaker Weinburger loves Bumblebee from the Transformer movies, so his parents put the word out, looking for anyone with a yellow car", "authors": ["Jan Crawford"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/11/bbca12be-d0ba-4234-91ad-444f34e0065e/thumbnail/1200x630/ba61861b30b79b4713d70e35996c43fa/0911-en-cancerkid-crawford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
