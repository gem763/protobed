[Photo/VCG]\n\nPARIS - French luxury group LVMH has offered to buy Tiffany & Co. for $14.5 billion in cash, sending shares in the New York jewelers soaring.\n\nThe purchase would add another household name to LVMH's plethora of upscale brands. It owns fashion names such as Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer.\n\nIt would also give LVMH a much broader foothold in the United States and broaden its offerings in jewelry.\n\nLVMH cautioned in a brief statement that \"there can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement.\"\n\nTiffany said the offer was for $120 a share, which is about $14.5 billion. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the offer over the weekend.\n\nThe New York-based company said Monday that it was considering the offer. Its shares jumped 31% to $128.81 in premarket trading in New York.\n\nLVMH competes with the Kering Group, which owns Gucci and Saint Laurent, and Richemont SA, which owns Cartier.\n\n- AP", "description": "French luxury group LVMH has offered to buy Tiffany & Co. for $14.5 billion in cash, sending shares in the New York jewelers soaring.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db6ea5aa310cf3e97a349de.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
