Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,522.1 per ounce at 0742\n\nGMT, having fallen to a one-week low at $1,517.11 in the\n\nprevious session.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCv1 were flat at $1,529.50 an ounce.\n\n\"The reality of the trade war with the new tariffs being\n\nimplemented over the weekend has kept a risk-off tone in\n\nmarkets this morning,\" said ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said both the sides would still\n\nmeet for talks later this month.\n\n\"There is still a very high level of scepticism. Traders\n\nwant to see talks restart with both parties suggesting some\n\npositive outcomes before any optimism around the progress sets\n\nin,\" Hynes added.\n\nEscalation in the trade war between the world's biggest\n\neconomies and heightened fears over a global economic downturn\n\ncontributed to a rise of more than $100 for gold in August.\n\nA private business survey showed on Monday China's factory\n\nactivity unexpectedly expanded in August as production edged up,\n\nbut orders remained weak and business confidence faltered amid\n\nSino-U.S. trade woes. Global stocks fell on Monday as the imposition of new\n\ntariffs reinforced investors' worries over slowing global\n\ngrowth, with no clear end in sight for the trade war.\n\nMKTS/GLOB\n\nOn the technical front, \"near-term supportive interest sits\n\naround $1,515-$1,520, while resistance cuts in toward $1,535\n\nwith extension toward $1,550,\" MKS PAMP said in a note.\n\n\"At current levels, both CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading\n\nCommission) and ETF (exhange-traded fund) positions remain\n\nbullish and are likely to continue to be so over the near-term\n\nshould price action remain firm broadly around $1,500-$1,480.\"\n\nHoldings HLDSPDRGT=XAU in the world's largest gold-backed\n\nexchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust , fell 0.23% to\n\n878.31 tonnes on Friday. However, it was up about 12% for the\n\nyear so far.\n\nSpeculators increased their bullish stance in COMEX gold and\n\nupped net long positions in silver contracts in the week to Aug.\n\n27, U.S. CFTC data showed on Friday. Among other precious metals, silver dipped 0.2% to\n\n$18.31 per ounce.\n\nSpot platinum XPT= climbed 0.5% to $935.45 per ounce,\n\nwhile palladium XPD= was up 0.4% at $1,536.55.\n\nTrading could be subdued as U.S. financial markets are\n\nclosed on Monday for the Labour Day holiday.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold rises as U.S., China begin new round of tariffs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg"}
