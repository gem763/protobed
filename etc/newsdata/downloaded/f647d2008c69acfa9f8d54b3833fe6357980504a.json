But I like new challenges and to try something that has not been here before,\u201d Plachetka said.\n\nKobza said he thought the future lay in presenting culture in more innovative ways.\n\n\u201cMozart composed and premiered the opera in Prague, I think he is watching us today,\u201d Kobza said, sitting in a tub on the rooftop of the Lucerna Palace - just off Prague\u2019s central Wenceslas Square - that was built by the grandfather of former Czech president Vaclav Havel.\n\n\u201cI think things like this will be popular - doing quality events but shifting the way they are presented.\u201d\n\nThe spectators, who sat in their bath tubs in full evening attire, ended up very wet but were happy with the performance as well as the view from the rooftop, and the air temperature was fortunately around 30 degrees Celsius.\n\n\u201cThe water was warm. This was very pleasant, and a great performance by the soloists. This is something I will remember,\u201d Martin Zvonicek said.\n\n\u201cDon Giovanni\u201d, which tells the story of a sexually promiscuous nobleman whose past finally catches up with him, premiered in Prague, then part of the Austrian Hapsburg Empire, on Oct. 29, 1787.", "description": "Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" has been a favorite among opera lovers since it premiered in Prague in 1787 but it is unlikely that any have ever watched it on a rooftop in the Czech capital while submerged in a bath tub, a glass of bubbly in hand - till now.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
