It\u2019s a universe so dense, in fact, that it actually subsumed the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Tommy Westphall\u2013style, when its hosts \u2014 heightened, grotesque versions of comedians Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington \u2014 landed actual cameos in the actual Ant-Man films in an extension of one of their ego-tripping On Cinema feuds. They\u2019ve had the spinoff series, Decker, and the spinoff music career of Dekkar. Now, the film buffs will find themselves on the other side of the screen with the cinematic release of satirical campaign comedy Mister America, helmed by frequent On Cinema director Eric Notarnicola.\n\nThe film follows Heidecker\u2019s campaign to be San Bernardino District Attorney despite the fact that, as Turkington points out in the trailer, \u201che\u2019s not a lawyer\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t live in San Bernardino.\u201d The trailer sets the plot up as Heidecker\u2019s revenge against the District Attorney Vincent Rosetti, whom fans will certainly remember from the five-hour \u201cElectric Sun 20\u201d trial against Heidecker for the murder of 20 teens with toad venom-infused vapes. (We promise it\u2019s funny with or without context.) If you saw the trailer for Between Two Ferns and thought to yourself, Hmm, I can go about 80 percent weirder, then Mister America will be the trailer for you.", "description": "Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington star in the movie extension of the On Cinema at the Cinema universe, Mister America, which will be released in theaters this fall.
