Not all of us get to witness the amazing feats of the natural world happening in the flesh, though. Luckily, we have wildlife photographers who\u2019s riveting images can help bring the wilderness into our living rooms.\n\nThe Wildlife Photographer of the Year Award was announced Tuesday at London\u2019s Natural History Museum. The winner, Yongqing Bao of Qinghai, China, captured the moment a marmot reacts in shock at a Tibetan fox about to pounce. The photo is pretty funny, but it also communicates the terrifying reality animals face out there. You can almost hear the marmot\u2019s scream.\n\n\u201cPhotographically, it is quite simply the perfect moment,\u201d Roz Kidman Cox, chair of the judging panel, said in a press release announcing the winners. \u201cThe expressive intensity of the postures holds you transfixed, and the thread of energy between the raised paws seems to hold the protagonists in perfect balance.\u201d\n\nThe photos are a reminder that our planet is worth fighting for in an era of rising extinction worries and a dying planet.\n\nMaybe for you, the photo of a big fin reef squid that won 14-year-old Cruz Erdmann Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year is your reminder. For me, it\u2019s Shangzhen Fan\u2019s photo of a snow-covered desert. This year\u2019s award winners have something for everyone.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up our favourites.\n\n\u201cThe Moment\u201d shows the delicate dance between life and death on the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau in China\u2019s Qilian Mountains National Nature Reserve.
