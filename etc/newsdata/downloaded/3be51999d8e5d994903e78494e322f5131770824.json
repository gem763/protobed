We are French. The press and the TV talks to us about \u2018le Crunch\u2019. It\u2019s certainly a stand-out match,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will know where we are then, certainly. There is no better gauge than playing England when they are at this level,\u201d he told reporters in Kumamoto on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we can talk about fear but it\u2019s OK to mention it, because it\u2019s important to enter the field with a little apprehension: it allows you to dig deep. We need to play as well as we can to see where we really are.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s match in Yokohama will decide the winners of Pool C, who will go on to face the second-placed side in Pool D in the quarter-finals the following week.\n\nWith Wales in prime position to beat Australia to the top spot in Pool D, there have been suggestions that it might be better for France to lose and avoid the twice world champion Wallabies.\n\nFullback Maxime Medard scoffed at that idea, however.\n\n\u201cWales or Australia, it won\u2019t change a thing. They are both better than us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEngland are currently two or three levels above us. We have to do all we can to put our game in place, do some good things and build confidence ahead of the quarter-final.\n\n\u201cWe have no preference over who we play next, there is no choice. We\u2019re not going to throw the match. We are in an important competition. We will dig deep to win.\u201d\n\nWhile accepting that France have not yet hit their stride in Japan, Medard suggested Les Bleus are at their best when their backs are against the wall.\n\n\u201cFor a few years the French team has had a hard time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the three pool games, that was perhaps obvious. In the first match against Argentina, there were many problems but it was vital to win it.\u201d", "description": "Flanker Charles Ollivon says France are a little apprehensive about taking on an in-form England side on Saturday, but he believes the match will give Les Bleus a good idea of where they stand heading into the Rugby World Cup knockout stages.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438420806&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970QV-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
