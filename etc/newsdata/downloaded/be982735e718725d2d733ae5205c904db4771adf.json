Americans for Tax Reform has helpfully gathered up 17 video clips of the Massachusetts senator dodging the question.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious why Warren doesn\u2019t want to utter the words \u201cmiddle-class tax hike.\u201d She\u2019s smart enough to know Republicans would play that quote on an endless loop in every battleground state up until Election Day.\n\nBut by focusing on Medicare for All, Warren\u2019s critics are letting her off too easy. That\u2019s because Medicare for All isn\u2019t the only massive new government program she would impose on the country.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of what she\u2019s listed \u2026 so far \u2026 and the 10-year costs:\n\nGreen New Deal: $4 trillion \u201cin green research, manufacturing, and exporting,\u201d emission-free buildings, electricity, and so on.\n\nSocial Security expansion: Warren wants to dramatically expand benefits, which will cost taxpayers at least $1.8 trillion. She claims it\u2019s all paid for by imposing a 14.8% tax on incomes above $250,000. But that income threshold isn\u2019t indexed, so the hike will eventually bite the middle class.\n\nFree college and debt forgiveness: $1.25 trillion.\n\nUniversal Child Care and Early Learning plan: $690 billion.\n\nHousing: $500 billion to \u201cbuild, preserve, and rehab units that will be affordable to lower-income families.\u201d\n\nOpioid crisis: $100 billion in additional spending.\n\nElection \u201csecurity\u201d: $20 billion.\n\nBroadband: $85 billion federal grant program \u201cto massively expand broadband access across the country\u201d and $2.5 billion \u201cto help states develop digital equity plans and launch digital inclusion project.\u201d\n\nJob training: $20 billion on apprenticeships and training programs \u201cfor people across rural America.\u201d\n\nThen there are the various other billion-here-billion-there programs, such as the $7 billion fund \u201cto close the gap in startup capital for entrepreneurs of color,\u201d relief for Puerto Rico\u2019s $120 billion in debt and pension obligations, and so on.\n\nAdd it all together and it comes out to roughly $42.5 trillion over a decade. In other words, Warren plans to nearly double the size of the federal government.\n\nIf Warren were to take every penny from everyone making more than $200,000, she wouldn\u2019t have enough money to pay for all these programs, much less tackle annual deficits that will be topping $1 trillion. She could double everyone\u2019s income taxes as well as corporate taxes and not have enough to cover just Medicare for All\u2019s costs.\n\nThe wealth tax she\u2019s depending on is an absolute abomination that would \u2014 if there\u2019s any hope left for this country \u2014 be found wildly unconstitutional, and if not, would crash the economy.\n\nAnd none of this includes the vast amount of new, hidden taxes her plans would impose on middle-class families. Most notably, her \u201cclean energy\u201d plan \u2014 which would ban fracking, phase out nuclear power, and force the country to 100% renewable energy in a matter of years \u2014 would cause utility bills to skyrocket. Her plan to force electric cars on the market would force sticker prices through the roof.\n\nWarren would have to raise middle-class taxes. Massively. And not just to pay for Medicare for All. She won\u2019t say it. Reporters won\u2019t pressure her to, or hold her accountable for her attempt to deceive the public. But there is no escaping it.\n\n\u2014 Written by John Merline\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
