USA TODAY\n\nHow will this year's World Series play out? Using the Dynasty League Baseball online simulation, USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner and DLB designer Mike Cieslinski will pre-play each game to provide some insight into the key matchups and strategy fans can expect to see in the Fall Classic.\n\nGame 1: Washington Nationals at Houston Astros\n\nGerrit Cole was virtually untouchable once again on the mound, tossing a four-hit shutout to lead the Houston Astros to a 4-0 victory over the Washington Nationals in Game 1 of USA TODAY's annual Simulated World Series.\n\nCole, who entered the World Series opener undefeated in his last 26 starts dating back to May 22, continued his run of dominating outings by striking out 14 Nationals hitters in going the distance.\n\nBOX SCORE: Astros 4, Nationals 0\n\nThe Astros got all the runs Cole would need in the second inning on Josh Reddick's two-out, two-run double off Washington starter Max Scherzer.\n\nHouston added two more runs on solo homers by Carlos Correa in the seventh and Michael Brantley in the eighth, but they were merely window dressing for the masterful job Cole did of silencing the Nats bats.\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY:Cole fans 14 in stellar opener\n\nWashington's only scoring threat came in the top of the fifth inning when catcher Yan Gomes walked and moved to third with one out. But Astros third baseman Alex Bregman quickly extinguished a potential rally with the defensive play of the game.\n\nWith the infield in to cut off a run in a 2-0 game, Trea Turner hit a sizzling one-hopper down the third base line. Gomes broke for the plate, but Bregman made a diving stop and jumped to his feet in time to nail the runner on a bang-bang play for the second out. Cole then struck out Adam Eaton to retire the side and the Nationals never threatened again.\n\nGerrit Cole put the finishing touches on a four-hit shutout by retiring Matt Adams on a fly ball to right in Game 1 of USA TODAY's Simulated Wold Series.

While Cole stole the show with his 14-strikeout masterpiece, Scherzer also went the distance and fanned 11 in a losing effort.\n\nThe only hit Scherzer allowed in seven at-bats with a runner in scoring position was Reddick's double. One way to beat him in the past has been with the home run \u2014 and he did allow two of them in this game \u2014 but they came after the Astros had already taken the lead.\n\n\u2022 Idle hands, idle bats? Although the computer simulation doesn't factor in the down time between series, the Nationals' week-long layoff after winning the NLCS could very well affect their timing against a pitcher as nasty as Cole.\n\nIn Sim Series Game 1, the Nats could muster only four hits off Cole \u2014 who was equally tough against left-handed batters (.175 opponents' batting average) as he was against right-handed batters (.198 opponents' average) during the regular season. So even though Washington can get an extra lefty bat in the lineup with the designated hitter in effect for Games 1 and 2 in Houston, it may not make much difference.\n\n\u2022 Who's on second? The only question among the two teams' lineup decisions in Game 1 is who the Nationals will start at DH and how that will impact who plays second base. Using Dynasty League Baseball's defensive metrics for the 2019 season, Howie Kendrick (C+ range, 80 error rating) rates slightly higher than either Asdrubal Cabrera (C, 80) or Brian Dozier (D, 80) \u2014 so he got the start at second.\n\nSince Cabrera is a switch-hitter and is better than Dozier against right-handed pitchers, he earned the start at DH. Although Kendrick and Cabrera went a combined 0-for-7 against Cole in Sim Series Game 1, Cabrera did draw one of the three walks Cole issued.\n\n\u2022 You're with me, leather: The two teams are quite similar on defense, with excellent third basemen in Anthony Rendon and Alex Bregman. The defensive play Bregman made in Game 1 was probably the turning point in the game because it thwarted Washington's best chance to break through against Cole.\n\nWhile the Astros' George Springer is above average in center field (B+ range, 100 error rating), the Nationals have a Gold Glove-caliber defender in center fielder Victor Robles \u2014 who earned a rare A+ range rating this season. Robles also has an outstanding throwing arm, which could come into play later in the series.\n\nIn addition, both teams have seen a significant improvement in the defensive capabilities of their left fielders. Both Michael Brantley of Houston and Juan Soto of Washington were defensive liabilities last season, but have been much better in 2019, earning above-average B ratings for their defensive range. Both made outstanding catches in their respective league championship series to underscore that fact.\n\n\u2022 Roster construction: Because of the dominant starting pitchers on both sides, the teams don't have to carry a bunch of relievers on their World Series rosters. The Astros don't have any left-handed pitchers among their 12. Meanwhile, the Nationals will give manager Dave Martinez plenty of flexibility in his lineup construction by carrying 14 hitters and only 11 pitchers.\n\nSimulate your own World Series.
