But there has yet to be a flow-through of those benefits, in terms of better bond pricing or demand from ESG investors for the green agency bonds, he said.\n\nFreddie Mac reported that its green program was expected to save 3.6 billion gallons of water last year at properties it helped finance, while Fannie Mae said tenants alone would likely save $72 million annually on utilities.\n\nTo qualify for Freddie\u2019s and Fannie\u2019s programs, a borrowing landlord must show a pathway to saving a minimum 30% in water and waste consumption at a property, with at least 15% of that total coming from reduced energy use.\n\nThe hitch? Despite the benefits, green bonds sold by the housing agencies have been achieving roughly the same pricing as regular ones without the eco-benefits. \u201cThey don\u2019t really price any differently,\u201d Wheeler said of the green bonds.\n\nThat means that, while borrowers benefit from lower loan coupons, the housing agencies have yet to see lower costs when they pool green housing loans into bonds.\n\nThe housing agencies, themselves, don\u2019t make property loans, but they do buy debt from lenders that fit their criteria and package them into bonds with government backing.\n\nGovernment guarantees give the housing bonds a haven appeal akin to U.S. Treasury securities, which often provides the agencies a pricing advantage over private lenders.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.64% tumbled to a near-three-year low on Tuesday of 1.469%, after weak U.S. manufacturing data stoked fears of a looming U.S. recession and against the backdrop of a more than 300-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.08% .\n\nBecause Freddie, Fannie and Ginnie finance affordable housing, they also have taken a lead in reducing the carbon footprint of an important swath of the nation\u2019s multifamily properties.\n\nLow-income communities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events, in part because many affordable rental properties have been located in flood-prone areas, according to a new report from the Center for American Progress, a policy institute with a liberal viewpoint.\n\nWithout a clearer pricing advantage on green bonds, there are no guarantees that the U.S. housing agencies will continue prioritizing planet-friendly housing finance.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to unveil soon its plans to privatize Freddie and Fannie, which a decade ago were taken into conservatorship in the wake of the global financial crisis. More details are expected on the privatization front in early September, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWheeler said a lot about Freddie and Fannie\u2019s green initiatives could hinge on what the privatization plan looks like. \u201cIt\u2019s the wild card,\u201d he said.", "description": "Landlords can take out green apartment loans to retrofit aging U.S. housing stock and lighten its environmental footprint, but Canter Fitzgerald analysts say...", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ599_Green__ZG_20190903153311.jpg"}
