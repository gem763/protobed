Those interested in holding a satellite caucus would have to submit an application to a review committee, which would make a determination.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe proposal, which must still go before a Democratic National Committee panel, came after the DNC scrapped Iowa\u2019s earlier plan for telephone-based \u201cvirtual caucuses,\u201d amid security concerns.\n\nThe decision, which also scuttled Nevada\u2019s virtual caucus proposal, stirred frustration among Democrats in both states after they spent months developing plans to fulfill a new DNC requirement to expand caucus accessibility.
