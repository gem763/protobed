Nagpur Soybean, Soyoil, Soymeal Open- September 10, 2019 Nagpur Soybean, Soyoil, Soymeal Open-September 10, 2019 Nagpur, Sept 10 (Reuters) \u2013 The slide in soyabean oil prices continued unabated in Vidarbha region of Western Maharashtra for second day today on persistent selling by stockists amid good supply from producing regions and weak trends in overseas markets. Sentiment turned bearish as American soya digam reported down. Sharp fall on NCDEX in soyabean oil and downward trend in Madhya Pradesh edible oil prices also affected sentiment, according to sources. ***** VIDARBHA MARKETS OILS * Cottonseed, groundnut loose, groundnut refined, sunflower refined, linseed, rapeseed, castor and coconut KP oil ruled steady here in sluggish trading activity. * Traders expect further fall in soyabean oil here. SOYMEAL * Soymeal prices today ruled steady here but demand was poor. Fresh rise in international soymeal prices also affected sentiment. SOYABEAN * Soyabean prices firmed up again in Nagpur Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) on increased buying support from local crushing plants. Healthy rise on NCDEX, good recovery in Madhya Pradesh soyabean prices and enquiries from South- based plants also boosted prices. About 400 soyabean bags reported for auction in Nagpur APMC, according to sources.
