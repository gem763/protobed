According to Trump, talks collapsed after North Korea demanded sanctions be lifted even if it only partly denuclearized, though North Korea disputed that account.\n\nTrump hailed Sunday's meeting as \"wonderful,\" but North Korea's new statement indicates a return to anger between the two countries.\n\nNorth Korea said in the statement that the US has made \"deliberate attempts\" to \"undermine the peaceful atmosphere that has been created on the Korean Peninsula in no easy way.\"\n\nPyongyang said it was responding to an accusation by the US that it had breached a cap on refined petroleum imports, and to a letter sent by UN Security Council members to other UN states urging them to impose sanctions on North Korea.\n\nTrump proposed in a tweet on Saturday, the day before Trump and Kim's meeting, that the two leaders meet, and North Korea said at the time that this was the only proposal they had received.\n\nNorth Korea said in its statement on Wednesday that the fact that the meeting was proposed and it received the letter on the same day was significant.\n\n\"What can't be overlooked is the fact that this joint letter game was carried out by the permanent mission of the United States to the U.N. under instruction of the State Department, on the very same day when President Trump proposed for the summit meeting,\" it said.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the letter is dated June 27 - last Thursday - and urges UN member states to comply with demands from the UN's sanctions committee to send North Koreans working in other countries back to the country.\n\nThe North Korean delegation said on Wednesday: \"It is quite ridiculous for the United States to continue to behave obsessed with sanctions and pressure campaign against [North Korea], considering sanctions as a panacea for all problems.\"\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "North Korea said it was was responding to a letter from the US, France, the UK, and Germany that urged UN members to impose sanctions against it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9072/9a44a49b870949c6918310153a6cc683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-04"}
