Embattled chief executive Carrie Lam is also scheduled to give a speech, and is expected to formally withdraw the extradition bill that sparked the protests.\n\nWith violence escalating, foreign governments including the US and UK are putting more pressure on Beijing to act humanely and hold up its end of the Sino-British Joint Declaration \u2013 an agreement meant to protect freedoms in Hong Kong when the former colony was returned to China.\n\nAmerican politicians have also introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would mandate an annual review to determine whether Hong Kong remained sufficiently autonomous to justify unique treatment by the US.\n\nIt would also sanction individuals over human rights violations and bar them from entering the country.\n\nThe bill has drawn bipartisan support and is scheduled to be considered in the House this week, after sailing unanimously through earlier committees.\n\nProtesters first took to the streets over concerns that suspects extradited to China would not receive a fair trial, as Communist Party control contributes to a 99.9 per cent conviction rate.\n\nBut after a summer of unrest, a pledge Ms Lam made last month to officially axe the legislation wasn\u2019t enough to appease protesters. Activists have expanded their demands to include Ms Lam\u2019s resignation, an independent probe into police handling of the protests, democratic election reforms, and for all rioting charges to be dropped as the offence carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.\n\nPolice have fired live rounds, sometimes as a warning, hitting at least two teenage protesters. Activists are also increasingly aggressive, hitting police officers with sticks, throwing petrol bombs and setting fire to road barricades. Over the weekend, the back of a police officer\u2019s neck was also slashed.\n\nChina is also battling foreign scrutiny in Xinjiang, a land-locked western province where millions of Muslim minorities have been locked up and tortured in \u201cre-education camps.\u201d\n\nLast week, the US Commerce Department also announced sanctions on 28 public security bureaus and companies in China implicated in human rights violations in Xinjiang.", "description": "China\u2019s president Xi Jinping has warned efforts to divide or destabilise China will end with \u201cshattered bones,\u201d as international pressure mounts over the government\u2019s handling of protests in Hong Kong and a widespread crackdown on Muslim minority groups.\u00a0 \u201cAnyone attempting to split China in any part", "authors": ["Sophia Yan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FbiS_NWgAEOVQDPhJqz3TA--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/13a58e438bce25d8564963e2812be918", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
