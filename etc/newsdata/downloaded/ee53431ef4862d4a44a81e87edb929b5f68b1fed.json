He's played the youngsters and I'm pleased to see them in there, with Saka.\n\n'But Saka, for an 18-year-old, if you're leaving Ozil totally out of the squad, then we have to see more from him [Saka], we have to see more from Joe [Willock].\n\n'Unfortunately, it was a game where it passed them both by and then it comes down to the manager and his choices.\n\n'He's made the change at half-time, with Ceballos, so you're thinking to yourself: \"Why didn't you start him in the first place?\"\n\nCeballos came on as a substitute at half-time at Bramall Lane in the Premier League\n\n'Start him. He's someone that gets on the ball when they want to try and play out, [Matteo] Guendouzi's got a lot of energy and get the boys playing.\n\n'[Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang didn't have anything to play off because there wasn't any creativity.'\n\nCeballos had a positive impact when coming off the bench at half-time in Sheffield but he couldn't make the vital difference as Arsenal looked for a way back into the game at 1-0 down.\n\nThe Gunners will be desperate to bounce back when they take on Portuguese outfit Vitoria in the Europa League on Thursday night before taking on Crystal Palace at home in the Premier League just three days later.", "description": "The Gunners fell to a dismal 1-0 defeat at Bramall Lane on Monday night in the Premier League to leave them fifth in the table after nine games, two points off Chelsea in fourth.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/20036084-0-image-a-13_1571749912223.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
