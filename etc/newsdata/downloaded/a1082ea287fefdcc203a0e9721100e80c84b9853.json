Other countries falling into the same bracket are Peru, Chile, Mongolia, Australia and Chile.\n\nAccording to the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research non-profit group, South Africa will face high water stress by 2040. This means that between 40% and 80% of water available to agricultural, domestic, and industrial users is withdrawn annually.\n\n\n\nMoody's says mining companies have been putting measures in place to decrease water use, such as desalinating seawater, recycling water or using closed circuit systems. But this, in turn, raises the costs for projects. Higher water stress will to lead to increased capital spending and operating costs, as companies look to \"lock down sustainable water sources\".\n\nSmall mining companies may be particularly at risk, said Moody's, as they may not be able to afford increased costs associated with securing enough water.\n\n\"The length of time to bring a project into production and increasingly rigorous requirements for aspects such as water availability and management and tailing dam construction will contribute to increased project delays; requiring companies to have a stronger financial profile given the inherent volatility in the industry,\" it said.", "description": "High water stress will to lead to increased capital spending and operating costs, as companies look to 'lock down sustainable water sources'.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9276/fe6edcc3fc18457e81308429f49db8bb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
