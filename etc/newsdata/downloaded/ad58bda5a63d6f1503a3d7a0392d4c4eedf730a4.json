The study counted a mass shooting as an attack that kills at least four people.\n\nRepublicans, tending towards loosened rules, introduced 48% more firearm-related bills in the year after a mass shooting, according to the study. Democrats, tending towards tighter rules, introduced 11% more bills researchers said.\n\nIn fact, \u201ca mass shooting roughly doubles the number of laws enacted in a year that loosen gun restrictions in states with Republican-controlled legislatures.\u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t any statistically significant spike in new gun laws in Democrat-controlled statehouses, according to the study, which was distributed this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Gun-control policies like universal background checks have different impacts in cities and rural areas, new study says\n\nThere are more than 30,000 gun fatalities a year, the study said. More than half (56%) are suicides and 40% are homicides, the researchers said. Between 1989 and 2014, mass shootings accounted for 0.13% of all gun deaths, they added.\n\nGiven those numbers, mass shootings appear to have \u201coutsized influence,\u201d on when lawmakers have decided when to act during that lengthy span from 1990 to 2014, the researchers wrote.\n\nIn addition to taking handgun ammunition off its shelves and stopping handgun sales in Alaska \u2014 which close out the retailer\u2019s sales of handguns \u2014 Walmart is also asking shoppers not to bring their guns into stores even if state laws allow \u201copen carry.\u201d\n\nThe National Rifle Association said it was \u201cshameful to see Walmart succumb to the pressure of the anti-gun elites. Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nOthers supported Walmart\u2019s decision. For example, Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke, who once represented El Paso in his congressional district, said on Twitter TWTR, -1.86%, \u201cThis is a step in the right direction \u2014 and I\u2019m grateful Walmart has taken action \u2014 but we can\u2019t rely on corporations to stop gun violence.\u201d\n\nA Walmart WMT, -1.57% spokesman declined to comment beyond McMillon\u2019s announcement.\n\nWalmart shares are up 23% year to date. The S&P 500 SPX, -2.05% is up almost 16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.09% is up nearly 12% over the same period.", "description": "\u2018It\u2019s clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,\u2019 Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said this week.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ619_walmar_ZG_20190903213925.jpg"}
