REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nReal wages dipped 0.6% in August from a year earlier, labour ministry data showed on Tuesday, following a revised 1.7% annual drop in July.\n\nMonthly wage data showed nominal total cash earnings fell 0.2% in August, down for a second straight month.\n\nRegular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, was up 0.3%, rising for a second month in a row.\n\nOne-off special payments declined 11.4% in August from a year earlier, after a revised 3.3% decline in July.\n\nOvertime pay was up 0.9% in August from a year earlier, up for a second straight month.\n\nWeak wages add to worries that Japan\u2019s sales tax increase to 10% from 8% could cut into consumer spending. A previous tax increase in 2014 hurt sentiment and helped lead to an economic downturn.\n\nJapan\u2019s economy has slowed as the U.S.-China trade war and weak external demand hurt the export-reliant economy. The affect of the higher levy could slow the pace of recovery.\n\nRevelations this year that labour ministry officials used faulty polling methods, which forced revisions, cast doubt on the accuracy of the ministry\u2019s wage data from 2004 to 2017.\n\nThe error has made it harder to assess the actual status of wages.", "description": "Real wages in Japan adjusted for inflation fell for an eighth straight month in August, raising worries about the resilience in consumer spending after an increase in sales tax and weakening global demand.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438248701&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961RH", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
