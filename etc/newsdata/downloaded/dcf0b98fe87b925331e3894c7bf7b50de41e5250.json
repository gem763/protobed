What better way to pass the time than to count down these final 55 days by arguing over who wore each jersey number best until we reach No. 00.\n\nThere are currently 33 days until the season opener on Oct. 22. So, who wore No. 33 best?\n\n[55 \u2022 54 \u2022 53 \u2022 52 \u2022 51 \u2022 50 \u2022 49 \u2022 48 \u2022 47 \u2022 46 \u2022 45 \u2022 44 \u2022 43 \u2022 42 \u2022 41 \u2022 40 \u2022 39 \u2022 38 \u2022 37 \u2022 36 \u2022 35 \u2022 34]\n\nShoutouts\n\nAlvan Adams, the Rookie of the Year and an All-Star in 1976, wore No. 33 throughout a 13-year career with the Phoenix Suns. The franchise retired his number, although he and the team made an exception for Grant Hill from 2007-12.\n\nUwe Blab, whose name I have always wanted to pronounce as Ooooooh-Weeeee Blob but is actually pronounced OOO-vay Blop, still has an all-time NBA moniker.\n\nBoris Diaw, the 2006 Most Improved Player, a 2014 NBA champion, coffee lover and doughboy legend wore No. 33 with \u201cThe Beautiful Game\u201d San Antonio Spurs.\n\nDanny Granger, the Most Improved Player and an All-Star in 2009.\n\nEddie Griffin, gone too soon.\n\nGrant Hill, a Hall of Famer whose ascent to all-time greatness was hindered by injury, wore No. 33 for four different teams (thanks to Alvin Adams) over an 18-year career that still included the 1995 Rookie of the Year and seven All-Star honors.\n\nHot Rod Hundley, the legendary broadcaster and college teammate of Jerry West who had a complicated flair for the dramatic, wore No. 33 for both of his All-Star appearances and all six of his seasons during another career cut short by injury.\n\nRich Jones, a two-time ABA All-Star, sported No. 33 for the entirety of an eight-year professional career. He owns the distinction of scoring the last basket in ABA history, a last-second layup in the clinching Game 6 of the 1976 Finals that padded his New York Nets\u2019 title win before the NBA absorbed the franchise in the merger.\n\nWendell Ladner, a mustachioed bruising forward who wanted to be the Burt Reynolds of basketball and served as an inspiration for the movie \u201cSemi-Pro,\u201d wore No. 33 for both of his ABA All-Star campaigns. He died in a mid-career plane crash at age 26, his body identified by the presence of his 1974 ABA championship ring.\n\nAlonzo Mourning, a Hall of Famer, wore 33 for three different teams over a 15-year career that included seven All-Star appearances, two Defensive Player of the Year honors and the 2006 NBA championship. His number is retired by the Miami Heat.\n\nCharlie Scott, another Hall of Famer, captured ABA Rookie of the Year honors and made five All-Star appearances wearing No. 33 for the Virginia Squires and Phoenix Suns. He switched to No. 11 for his final five seasons, including a 1978 NBA title run with the Boston Celtics, the same team he initially spurned to join the ABA.\n\nDavid Thompson, a Hall of Famer whose NBA career was derailed at age 29 by cocaine and a knee injury suffered in a Studio 54 stairwell, wore No. 33 for seven of his nine seasons, a stretch that saw the 1976 Rookie of the Year award and five All-Star nods. Once dubbed \u201cMichael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, and LeBron James rolled into one,\u201d Thompson\u2019s 33 is retired by the Denver Nuggets.\n\nCaveats\n\nMack Calvin, who has made an impassioned Hall of Fame plea, wore No. 33 for a single season late in a nine-year career that included five-time ABA All-Star nods.\n\nAlex Hannum, TKTKKTKTKKTKT.\n\nAntawn Jamison, the 2004 Sixth Man of the Year and a two-time All-Star\n\nMaurice Lucas, a beloved teammate of Bill Walton on the 1977 NBA champion Portland Trail Blazers for whom his son Luke is named, wore No. 33 for half a season with the New Jersey Nets between his fourth and fifth All-Star appearances.\n\nEarl \u201cThe Pearl\u201d Monroe, a Hall of Famer, wore No. 33 for just two of his 13 seasons \u2014 his 1968 Rookie of the Year campaign and his first half-season with the New York Knicks. A four-time All-Star and 1973 NBA champion, Monroe has two numbers retired \u2014 his No. 10 with the Baltimore Bullets and No. 15 with the Knicks.\n\nWillie Naulls, a member of the NBA\u2019s first all-black staring lineup, made four All-Star appearances with the Knicks and won three titles with the Boston Celtics, but wore No. 33 for neither team. He only donned the number for 19 games as a rookie.\n\nStory continues", "description": "There are currently 33 days until the NBA season opener on Oct. 22.
