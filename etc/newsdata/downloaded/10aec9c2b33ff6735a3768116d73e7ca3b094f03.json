Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night\u2019s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run \"Medicare-for-all\" plan.\n\nWarren, D-Mass., has repeatedly refused to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class. During Tuesday's debate, she maintained that she would lower costs for everyone except the wealthy and large corporations. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has similarly pledged to lower costs but disclosed that his plan would entail raising taxes.\n\nBUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE\u2019LL FINANCE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'\n\nAfter being asked by the moderators early in the fourth-round debate at Otterbein University whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health care proposal, the progressive senator from Massachusetts didn\u2019t specifically answer, instead pledging that \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nHost Sandra Smith said estimates place the 10-year cost of the \"Medicare-for-all\" plans at $32-34 trillion.\n\n\"Don't the candidates on that stage touting 'Medicare-for-all' have to explain how you pay for it?\" Smith asked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIf you look back to the 2018 election, the American people spoke loud and clear that they wanted Democrats in power and that\u2019s why we won back the House of Representatives and the number one issue was healthcare,\u201d Hinojosa said, acknowledging that candidates have said costs \"will go up for middle-class Americans.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.", "description": "Following a contentious debate on health care during Tuesday night\u2019s fourth primary debate, Democratic National Committee Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa was pressed on how a $34\u00a0trillion \"Medicare-for-all\" plan will be paid.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/smith.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
