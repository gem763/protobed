These cases have progressed painfully slowly in the manner they have been finalised and the decision whether to prosecute or not. It is abysmal,\u201d Batohi said.\n\n\u201cIt is a poor success rate. As a matter of fact, the word \u2018success\u2019 shouldn\u2019t even be used.\u201d\n\nThe municipalities currently being investigated include:\n\n. Mopani District Municipality in Limpopo: for, among other things, alleged tender irregularities and the failure to pay R120 million that the municipality did not use back to National Treasury;\n\n. Mbhashe Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape: for alleged irregularities in relation to the purchase of vehicles;\n\n. Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in Gauteng: for irregularities in the manner that building work was subcontracted;\n\n. Endumeni Local Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal: for tender irregularities;\n\n. Moretele Local Municipality, also in KwaZulu-Natal: for the contracting of IT services; and\n\n. Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality: for the alleged irregular purchase of vehicles and allegations of wrongdoing in relation to repairs and maintenance work to fire stations and the procurement of office furniture.\n\nThe SIU\u2019s Mothibi said that in addition to investigating municipal officials, the unit had also looked into the service providers that did business with the municipalities involved as they tended to move to the next municipality, and the next, after the one they were doing business with had been plunged into financial chaos.\n\nBatohi told MPs that her unit was not properly equipped to handle the plethora of cases that had been referred to it, citing the following as an example: \u201cIn the Eastern Cape, where there is so much corruption, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) only has two specialised commercial prosecutors.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question from DA MP Alf Lees, Batohi said her budget for the present financial year was just under R4 billion.\n\nLees told Batohi that the NPA\u2019s low success rate had to be partly ascribed to its inadequate budget and the fact that the unit could no longer appoint prosecutors. \u201cTo think that we just gave the SABC a bailout of R4 billion. We give institutions [such as the NPA and SIU], which are absolutely critical to combating corruption, less than we give a state entity like the SABC. It\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d\n\nBatohi recommended that the SIU and the NPA prioritise municipalities where officials had contravened the Public Finance Management Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act. \u201cIt is much easier to prosecute these kinds of offences. And once these officials are found guilty, they cannot be employed by the state again.\u201d", "description": "The wastage, maladministration and fraud crippling South Africa\u2019s municipalities remains largely unpunished, even when criminal charges are brought against those involved.", "authors": ["Liesl Peyper"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4006/7731dd42f6984e6492a987cab7634338.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
