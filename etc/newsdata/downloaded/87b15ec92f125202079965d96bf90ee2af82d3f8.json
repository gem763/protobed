One of them is unrepeatable in family circles.\n\nFor bless me, it really is fast.\n\nDBS Super-fright: Daily Mail motoring editor Ray Massey got a shock when he took to the wheel of the latest 211mph Aston Martin\n\nI was out in vintage Bond country \u2013 the German and Austrian Alps \u2013 putting this car designed for continental cruising firmly through its paces.\n\nAston Martin bosses insisted before the launch that they wanted to create a very fast car that was engaging and exciting for drivers of all abilities and didn't terrify less experienced owners.\n\nBut they also boasted that it 'packs a breath-taking punch' like James Bond who drove its predecessors.\n\nThey've succeeded in their aims \u2013 up to a point.\n\nYou can drive this stunning creature for long distances in sporty comfort and refinement and enjoy it tremendously.\n\nBut you do have to treat it with respect \u2013 because this beauty can very quickly turn into a beast.\n\nThe DBS Superleggera is Aston Martin's new super grand tourer. It costs from \u00a3225,000 (before options)\n\nRay Massey quickly notices that there isn't much to see in his rear-view mirror as he races the super-potent British GT car through the German and Austrian Alps\n\nThe DBS Superleggera - or superlight - is powered by a mighty 5.2 litre twin-turbo V12 petrol engine developing 725 horse-power\n\nThe clever stability and safety features go a long way towards saving you from yourself. But don't push it.\n\nThe new DBS Superleggera accelerates from rest to 62mph in a staggering 3.4 seconds. But no stopwatch can come close to translating how nerve-tinglingly exciting this actually feels behind the wheel.\n\nIt's powered by a mighty 5.2 litre twin-turbo V12 petrol engine developing 725 horse-power \u2013 equivalent to seven Ford Fiestas - and linked to an enthusiastic eight-speed automatic gearbox.\n\nSignificantly, it will also sprint from rest to 100mph in just 6.4 seconds and cover the stretch from 50mph to 100mph in fourth gear in just 4.2 seconds.\n\nRay Massey says you can drive in supreme comfort and refinement at modest speeds. But once you put your foot down the DBS becomes a difficult animal to tame\n\nThe DBS Superleggera replaces the Vanquish S as the British brand's flagship GT model\n\nOne of its best credentials is how well it handles tight and twisty alpine roads - like this one\n\nIt's beautifully balanced taking on corners on tight and twisting alpine roads and is beautifully mannered once you're in the rhythm for some long-legged mile-munching.\n\nThere is a choice of three dynamic modes which can be selected to intensify or relax DBS driving responses: GT for more relaxed cruising, Sport for more engaged driving, and Sport Plus for full-on excitement.\n\nDriving in automatic mode, specially developed software guiding the the eight-speed 'box helps gauge driving conditions and the driver's input to ensure the car is in exactly the right gear at the right time.\n\nThe V12 powerplant has gas-guzzling fuel economy averaging 22.9mpg and CO2 emissions at 285g/km - you'll need deep pockets to keep it fuelled\n\nAs you might expect, the soundtrack produced by the quad exhaust pipes in a match for the beautiful looks\n\nThe sports-plus seats offer firm support and comfort for long distance drives\n\nBut the fun really starts when you use the full-length paddle-shifters on the steering wheel to manually take control of the transmission and run up and down through the gears yourself.\n\nAston Martin DBS Superleggera: Will it fit in my garage?

Just as well.\n\nThe sports-plus seats offer firm support and comfort for long distance drives. But although there are two sculpted seats in the back, you wouldn't want to go far in them unless a small child.\n\nThe new flagship DBS Superlegerra replaces the Vanquish S at the top of the Aston Martin pile.\n\nIt's a worthy successor to Aston Martin's beefy long distance cruising models which over nearly fifty years have been driven on the big screen by British secret agent 007. And ultimately the best of the bunch.\n\nHowever, it's not what you'd call efficient.\n\nThe V12 powerplant has gas-guzzling fuel economy averaging 22.9mpg and CO2 emissions at 285g/km - you'll need deep pockets to keep it fuelled.\n\nTreat it with respect: Ray Massey says the Aston Martin DBS Superleggera isn't a car you should take lightly when you're at the wheel\n\nHistory of DBS The 'DBS' nameplate was first used in 1967 on a six cylinder V6 vehicle created by Aston Martin's in-house designer William Towns. It was designed to be a dramatic departure from the DB6 it replaced, although the the fastback four-seater DBS was produced alongside the ageing DB6 for three years, until the older car was finally phased out in 1970. Two years into production, the six-cylinder DBS was joined by the DBS V8 powered by Aston Martin's all-new 5.3-litre V8 engine hailed as 'the world's fastest four-seater production car'. Just over 1000 DBS cars were built between 1967 and 1972, including both V6 and V8-powered editions. After a gap of 35-year the DBS name was revived in 2007, when the all-new DBS - a development of the DB9 - was unveiled at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in the USA before going on sale the following year and replacing the first generation Vanquish S. Powered by a 6.0-litre, 510bhp V12 engine linked to a six-speed manual gear-box, it had a top speed in excess of 190mph. Later DBS versions had a choice of manual or automatic transmission. In 2009 Aston Martin introduced the DBS Volante - the first ever open-top DBS. Production of both the second-generation DBS and DBS Volante ceased in 2012.\n\nFerrari book that costs as much as a family car\n\nIf you can't run to buying a brand-new Ferrari, how about books about them for the price of a family car?\n\nTaschen next month publishes Ferrari, in a limited edition run of 1,947 books \u2014 the figure commemorating the year in which the firm was founded by race car legend Enzo Ferrari.\n\nEach lavishly illustrated 514\u2011page collectors' edition tome, written in collaboration with Ferrari, uses the same leather as in the cars and sits in an aluminium display case replicating a Ferrari engine.\n\nSpeed read: The 250 Art Edition volumes of Ferrari \u2014 which include a bookstand evocative of a Ferrari 12-cylinder engine \u2014 are priced at an eye-watering \u00a322,000\n\nStandard versions are a cool \u00a34,500.\n\nBut the 250 Art Edition volumes \u2014 which include a bookstand evocative of a Ferrari 12-cylinder engine \u2014 are \u00a322,000.\n\nEach is signed by Enzo's son Piero Ferrari, the late Ferrari and Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne and his successor as Ferrari chairman John Elkann.\n\nPrescott Hill Climb celebrates 80th birthday\n\nExpect two days of high-octane action at the Vintage Sports Car Club's 80th anniversary celebrations of the Prescott Hill Climb.\n\nVintage vehicle fan Peter Waller, now 85, diving his ERA R9B at the Prescott HillClimb in the Seventies\n\nThis weekend, about 250 pre-war racing and sports cars \u2014 including MGs, Bentleys, Bugattis, Austins, Alvises and ERAs \u2014 take on the steep 880-yard course at Gotherington, Glos.\n\nTickets at the gate \u00a325 per day, \u00a340 for the weekend.
