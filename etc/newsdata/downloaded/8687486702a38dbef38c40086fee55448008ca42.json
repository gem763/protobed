He continued:\n\nThe children at the center of this dispute are in immediate and irrevocable danger. We ask that you open an investigation this matter as soon as possible and act pursuant to your emergency powers to protect the boy in question [from] permanent and potentially irreversible harm by his mother.\n\nThe letter spotlighted the broader childcare problems raised by the claim that children can be converted into members of the opposite sex by medical interventions such as pills, hormones, and surgery. The letter says:\n\nWe have been made aware that last year, during an earlier hearing in the case \u2014 which was attended by a [state] Department caseworker \u2014 the mother admitted multiple times under oath that she intends to transition the boy to a girl. The mother also intends to administer puberty blocking drugs to the child and start that process as early as next year. The social worker that the mother is using to transition the child, who operates Dallas Rainbow Counseling, wrote a letter recommending that the child to be admitted to a \u201cclinic\u201d at Dallas Children\u2019s Hospital that will facilitate the child\u2019s transition. One of the counselors who testified for the mother admitted that there is virtually no peer-reviewed research on the transitioning of a child from one gender to another. But the mother refuses to get any second opinions from other doctors or counselors recommended by the father. The end goal of the mother is to affirm her seven-year-old boy\u2019s gender dysphoria by socially transitioning him to a girl now, and administer puberty blocking drugs in a year so that he subsequently can undergo hormone therapy and explore surgery to physically and permanently alter his body.\n\nAn increasing number of children are facing this medical \u201ctransition\u201d ordeal. But there are a growing number of reports about the biological and mental harms of the treatment, and an increasing number of adults who \u201cdetransition\u201d by rejecting the claim that they can solve their problems by changing their sex.\n\nThe AG\u2019s request is likely to be followed, even though a divorce judge gave the father veto power over the mother\u2019s sex change plans after the letter was sent.\n\nAny investigation of the state\u2019s \u201ctransgender\u201d industry is likely to face furious opposition from the clinics and drug companies that claim the ability to change people into members of the opposite sex.\n\nThe primary victims of the transgender ideology are teens \u2014 including some who would otherwise mature into lesbian women or gay men. But there is no media focus b/c feminists & progressives want more TGs & the L&G groups are steered by transgender donors. https://t.co/bD7c8UNSZe \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 23, 2019\n\nTransgender Facts\n\nIn general, the transgender ideology says a person\u2019s legal and civic recognition as a man or a woman must be determined by their \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by their biology.\n\nThe ideology also insists that men and women are more or less interchangeable, and it objects to the public\u2019s view of the two sexes as simultaneously different, complementary, and equal.\n\nThe transgender advocates want to impose their ideology on Americans by establishing \u201ctransgender rights\u201d laws, which would require the Department of Justice to penalize individuals and groups who insist that biology determines each person\u2019s male-or-female status \u2014 and also shapes peoples\u2019 likely political, civic, and personal priorities.\n\nPolls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency.\n\nMultiple polls show that most Americans reasonably wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology\u2019s claim that people\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of sympathy for people who say they are transgender alongside lopsided opposition to the ideology.\n\nThe transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have competing goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the differences between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, troubled teenage girls trying to flee womanhood, and people trying to \u201cdetransition\u201d back to their biological sex.\n\nIt also includes men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say they are entitled to women\u2019s rights, alpha males who insist they are the natural leaders of women, parents eager to support their children\u2019s\u2019 transgender claims, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, revenue-seeking drug companies, surgeons, and medical service providers.\n\nTransgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study. A Pentagon report commissioned by former Defense Secretary James Mattis said that \u201crates for genital surgery are exceedingly low- 2% of transgender men and 10% of transgender women.\u201d\n\nThe progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender identity\u201d has already attacked and cracked many popular social rules. Those rules help Americans manage cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.\n\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, children\u2019s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women\u2019s ideals of beauty, culture and civil society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.", "description": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has asked the state's family service agency to investigate the medical claims surrounding James Young, the seven-year-old boy whose mother says he wants to live as a \"transgender\" girl. | Politics", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Protect-Trans-Kids-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
