But injuries have decimated Purdue, which has lost quarterback Elijah Sindelar and star wide receiver Rondale Moore and been forced to play 30 true or redshirt freshmen through six games.\n\nIowa, on the other hand, is looking for somebody to pound on after dropping two straight to the Wolverines and Nittany Lions despite allowing just 27 combined points.\n\nThe Hawkeyes entered play as an 18-point favorite despite scoring just 15 points in their last two games.\n\n\u201cIowa has played some very good football,\u201d Purdue coach Jeff Brohm said. \u201cLike always, they are well-coached and sound in what they do and do a great job on defense and don\u2019t give up points. They don\u2019t give up big plays. They make you earn it.\u201d\n\nIOWA OFFENSE\n\nThe Hawkeyes followed up a 48-point outing against Middle Tennessee State with just 3 points against Michigan and 12 against Penn State. The running game, hampered by injuries to Iowa\u2019s interior line, has gone south in recent weeks. The Hawkeyes have just 71 yards rushing over their past two games.\n\n\u201cThe film has beared it out, two really good football teams playing extremely hard out there,\u201d Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said of Iowa\u2019s losing skid. \u201cBottom line is, they made some critical plays that we weren\u2019t able to make. Credit to our opponent. After watching the tape on Sunday, I feel the same way. I believe we have a good football team.\u201d\n\nSCOUTING THE BOILERMAKERS\n\nIowa\u2019s last two opponents rank second (Penn State, 8.2 points per game) and 15th (Michigan, 17.5 per game) in scoring defense. The Boilermakers are 87th at 29.8 points allowed. But Purdue found something in the passing game in last week\u2019s 40-14 win over Maryland. Freshman Jack Plummer was 33 of 41 passing for 420 yards and three touchdowns, with fellow rookie David Bell catching nine balls for 138 yards and two scores.\n\nBEATING FERENTZ\n\nBrohm is 2-0 against Ferentz. The Boilermakers won a 38-36 shootout at home in 2018 and beat Iowa in Iowa City 24-15 two years ago in a pair of upsets.\n\n\u201cWe hit a couple big plays over the top, our defense played well and we found a way to win,\u201d Brohm of that 2017 game. \u201cThis past year at home, we found a way to score early, which is important against them because they want to control the football and they want to run the clock.\u201d\n\nBrohm\u2019s passing attack has flummoxed Iowa\u2019s standout defensive coordinator Phil Parker, torching the Hawkeyes for 563 yards and seven TDs in those two meetings. But losing Moore will likely be a huge blow to the Boilers\u2019 passing game when playing a defense as talented as Iowa\u2019s.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nIowa quarterback Nate Stanley is spreading the ball around this season. Wide receivers Ihmir Smith-Marsette, Brandon Smith and Nico Ragaini share the team lead for receptions with 24. \u2026Plummer\u2019s 80.5 completion rate last week was the best for a Purdue quarterback with at least 40 passes in a game. Kyle Orton holds the overall school record, having completed 23 of 26 passes against Ball State in 2004. \u2026Stanley is 21-11 as the starter, and his next TD pass will put him second on Iowa\u2019s all-time list. \u2026Purdue is 129th out of 130 teams with just 63.5 rushing yards per game, 129th in yards per carry (2.24) and tied for 125th with four rushing TDs. Iowa is tied for fifth nationally with just two rushing TDs allowed.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing well enough on the line, not cohesively enough. We\u2019re working to get our best combination in there.\u201d - Ferentz\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No. 23 Iowa could use a boost after agonizing back-to-back losses to Michigan and Penn State.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Luke Meredith"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/penn_st_iowa_football_58154_c0-249-4718-3001_s1200x700.jpg?f3d36b16c384b95e0dde7f5bd4bc55f1ea5ab02e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
