We got him. It signifies our commitment to the enduring defeat of ISIS,\u201d said Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, using another name for the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the raid came amid rising concern that the diminishing U.S. military and civilian footprint, along with cuts in funding for stabilization and reconstruction, undermine that commitment in a part of the world where U.S. leadership is crucial both to American and global security.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly said that other regional actors should take over the expense and physical presence of the United States in Syria. Last year, Trump cut hundreds of millions of dollars in stabilization aid to areas where U.S. air power and American-advised and assisted Syrian Kurdish ground forces drove the Islamic State out of northern Syria. With the announced departure of U.S. troops in recent weeks, the administration has appeared to encourage the expansion of Turkey and Syrian government forces, along with their Russian allies, into the region.\n\nNone of these actors is seen as having the ability or the will to command the international coalition that brought down the caliphate, or to lead and equip the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Force.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurkey\u2019s main interest is in replacing the Kurds with Syrian refugees, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is unlikely to address the grievances of his citizens that helped bring the rise of the Islamic State in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe United States has got to make a choice,\u201d said Seth G. Jones , a former adviser to the U.S. Special Operations Command.\n\n\u201cAre they going to support, directly or indirectly, the Syrian government\u201d in maintaining or taking back territory in the face of an Islamic State resurgence, or is it going to support local actors in doing it? \u201cThe problem is the United States has decided for the moment to do neither,\u201d said Jones, now of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWalking away does not solve this problem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere are parts of the world where the United States can play a secondary role in supporting the efforts of other countries to fight terrorist groups, as it has done in West Africa, where France has taken the lead, several experts said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt one level, Trump is right in that I would love it if there was another entity willing and capable\u201d of taking on the task of combating the Islamic State in its core area of Syria and Iraq, said William F. Wechsler of the Atlantic Council, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and combating terrorism.\n\nBut \u201cthere is nobody else in the area that we\u2019re talking about right now,\u201d Wechsler said. If there were, he said, \u201cISIS would not have emerged in the first place. We are left with this same policy conundrum. As much as we want to hope\u201d that Islamic State resurgence \u201cis not the case, reality and experience tells us otherwise. We\u2019re forced to confront these issues sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRussia, which apparently agreed to allow U.S. aircraft conducting the Baghdadi raid to fly through airspace it controls in northwestern Idlib province, \u201cis not an ally of the United States. The president doesn\u2019t believe that. I don\u2019t believe that,\u201d White House national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien said Sunday on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. But, he added, \u201cwhen our interests overlap with Russia, there\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t work with them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRussia, however, has shown little interest in a sustained counterterrorism campaign in Syria, even if U.S. policy were to allow Russian dominance in the region.\n\nIn a news conference Sunday, SDF spokesman Redur Zelil said operations against the Islamic State would continue and \u201cwe will eliminate their sleeper cells across the region.\u201d But the shape of that effort remained unclear.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to monitoring the militant\u2019s remnants across the northeast, the area\u2019s mostly Kurdish administration is responsible for thousands of Islamic State prisoners, many of them foreigners.\n\nIn a visit to one of those facilities Sunday, prison guards described for a reporter how security had deteriorated since the Turkish assault. \u201cHalf of our guards were transferred to the front line,\u201d said one, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk with the media.\n\nAD\n\nReports of Baghdadi\u2019s death had yet to reach the inmates, and prisoners inside one cell asked reporters repeatedly for news from the outside. Guards have disconnected their television sets in recent weeks and family visits \u2014 where they have been allowed \u2014 have been suspended, prison authorities said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to give them anything that will make them riot,\u201d the guard said.\n\nBut intelligence and counterterrorism experts said the U.S. pullout from numerous areas of northern Syria \u2014 beyond the encirclement of the oil area held by the SDF far from Kurdish population areas \u2014 would make it more difficult to conduct operations like the Baghdadi mission, which depend heavily on human intelligence networks in the country.\n\nThe Kurds, who intelligence officials said provided crucial information in locating Baghdadi, have long been a key intelligence-sharing partner, gathering information from their own networks of human sources, current and former intelligence officials said. Trump acknowledged their contributions in his own statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut \u201cit takes months, if not years, to perfect the U.S. government\u2019s ability to manhunt in specific, semi-denied areas of operations\u201d like Syria, said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA official with extensive counterterrorism experience overseas who retired this year.\n\n\u201cFusing reports from our allies, human and signals intelligence and reconnaissance takes time, serious analytical work and patience,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will lose this critical edge with a withdrawal of forces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day,\u201d Polymeropoulos said of the Baghdadi killing, \u201cbut a clear reminder of why we actually need to remain in Syria, even in small numbers, as long as ISIS remains a threat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDaniel Hoffman, a former CIA officer who worked on counterterrorism operations in the Middle East, agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go out and meet sources or have liaison partners like the Kurds,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not there physically, then it\u2019s really hard to conduct the human intelligence-gathering that \u2026 is the backbone for conducting these kinds of raids.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nExperts differ on how quickly the Islamic State may be able to reformulate its leadership after Baghdadi\u2019s death and reactivate partially dormant cells into a fully resurgent terrorist group.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the impact it will have on ISIS going forward, this is more like the close of a chapter, but by no means the end of the story,\u201d said Nick Rasmussen, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center during the last two years of President Obama\u2019s tenure and the first year of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the immediate impact on the lethality of the group \u2026 or the degree to which ISIS as an organization or a global enterprise threatens the United States, that doesn\u2019t change in the immediate aftermath of something like this,\u201d he said.\n\nAn estimated tens of thousands of Islamic State fighters remain in Iraq and Syria, conducting sporadic attacks in both countries. Islamic State cells of varying activity now exist in 14 \u201cprovinces\u201d or countries, according to the Institute for the Study of War, which described a presence that \u201cprovides footholds from which to further metastasize, launch attacks, and gain resources to fund its resurgence in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne key question is whether Baghdadi\u2019s demise in Idlib province, where a small number of Islamic State fighters are located, will lead to an alliance with other extremist organizations there that have a much higher profile.\n\nThe province is largely controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a militant group that has reinvented itself several times during the civil war. After HTS broke with al-Qaeda last year, more extreme militants left the group to form a smaller, hard line faction, Hurras al-Din, which is the new al-Qaeda affiliate.\n\n\u201cIn the face of the kind of pressure and the mutual threats that they\u2019ve experienced, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more cooperation, even if it doesn\u2019t mean a public alliance\u201d among the extremists, said Tricia Burton, a former State Department counterterrorism official now at American University.", "description": "A reduced American footprint may prevent the U.S. from mounting the kind of counterterrorism campaign that brought down the caliphate.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "Louisa Loveluck", "Iraq", "Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PcQ5705zZwoLtfSjwhH_mN3MRkA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWL6TKXZAYI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
