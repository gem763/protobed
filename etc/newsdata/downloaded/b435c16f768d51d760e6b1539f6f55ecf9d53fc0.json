The ACT maximum is 36.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGot you,\u201d Singer replied, according to the document. \u201cSo can I just \u2014 I want to clarify. So she\u2019s going to take the test on her own, she\u2019s going to do her best, all that stuff, and then we\u2019re going to do our magic on the back end.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to \u2014 you\u2019re going to do what you do,\u201d Caplan said.\n\nIn another call, court records show, Caplan told Singer: \u201cIt\u2019s just, to be honest, I\u2019m not worried about the moral issue here. I\u2019m worried about the, if she\u2019s caught doing that, you know, she\u2019s finished.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Caplan was co-chairman of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, an international law firm with more than 700 attorneys. He left the firm soon after prosecutors announced charges in March against him, Singer and dozens of others in the \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d investigation. Prosecutors revealed a two-part scandal involving cheating on SAT and ACT admission tests and assistance to applicants to prominent universities using fake athletic credentials to pose as recruited athletes. Singer, the admitted mastermind, has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other crimes and is cooperating with the government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBribery scandal points to the athletic factor: A major force in college admissions\n\nWithin weeks of his arrest, Caplan apologized. \u201cI take full and sole responsibility for my conduct and I am deeply ashamed of my behavior and my actions,\u201d he said in an April statement. \u201cI apologize not only to my family, friends, colleagues and the legal Bar, but also to students everywhere who have been accepted to college through their own hard work.\u201d He said his daughter, who is still in high school, did not know of the scam at the time she took the test.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani sentenced Caplan to a month in prison, according to the office of the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. The judge also imposed a $50,000 fine, 250 hours of community service and one year of supervised release.\n\nCaplan was the fourth parent sentenced in the scandal within the past month. All pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nActress Felicity Huffman, who also participated in the test-cheating scheme, was sentenced in September to two weeks\u2019 imprisonment. California business executive Devin Sloane and Stephen Semprevivo, who participated in the recruiting fraud, were both sentenced to four months.\n\nProsecutors had recommended that Caplan spend eight months behind bars. \u201cThat a lawyer who has reached the apex of his profession could engage in such blatant criminality reveals a staggering disdain for the law,\u201d they wrote in a sentencing memorandum. \u201cAs much as any defendant in this case, Caplan deserves to go to jail.\u201d\n\nCaplan\u2019s attorneys urged Talwani to spare him a prison term or give him a sentence no longer than Huffman\u2019s. They said Caplan had expressed remorse and publicly acknowledged responsibility for the crime earlier than others caught in the scandal. In all, 35 parents have been charged in the investigation. Nineteen have pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u201cGordon quickly grasped the magnitude of the havoc he had caused,\u201d his attorneys wrote. \u201cHe knew instantly that his stupidity, his moment of ethical weakness had not just blown up his life and career. Gordon had inflicted a devastating \u2014 and intensely public \u2014 blow to the young, vulnerable person he was actually trying to help, his daughter.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Gordon Caplan had been a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher.
