The theory diminishes Russia's involvement in the DNC hack. Trump's former homeland security adviser recently called the theory \"completely debunked.\"\n\n\u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that was it. That\u2019s why we held up the money,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters at the earlier afternoon briefing.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d Mulvaney continued, suggesting Trump wanted assistance with an ongoing investigation by the Justice Department.\n\nAttorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrMatthew Shepard's parents blast Barr's LGBTQ record in anniversary of hate crime law Trump denies knowledge of Barr meeting in Italy, says it would be appropriate Mulvaney helped organize controversial Ukraine meeting MORE has ordered an inquiry into the FBI's original probe of 2016 Russian interference. Trump's critics view the investigation as an effort by the president to undermine the intelligence community's original finding that Moscow intervened to help him win.\n\nMulvaney also told reporters that there would be \u201cpolitical influence in foreign policy\u201d and that they needed to \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\nHours later, Mulvaney reversed course from his earlier remarks, saying the \u201conly reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\u201d He blamed the media for misinterpreting his statements.\n\n\u201cMultiple times during the more-than 30 minute briefing where I took over 25 questions, I referred to President Trump\u2019s interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and appropriately,\u201d Mulvaney said in the statement.\n\nMulvaney noted \u2014 as he did during the briefing \u2014 that security assistance was eventually released to Ukraine, something he framed as proof that it was not conditioned on Ukraine assisting in investigations related to the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThere was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server - this was made explicitly obvious by the fact that the aid money was delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians regarding the server,\u201d Mulvaney continued.\n\n\u201cThere never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s remarks earlier in the day appeared to undercut Trump\u2019s repeated pronouncements that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d related to his conversations with Ukraine.\n\nTrump encouraged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on a July 25 phone call to investigate an unproven theory about Kiev\u2019s involvement in the DNC server hack as well as corruption allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says lawmakers should censure Schiff Schiff says committees will eventually make impeachment inquiry transcripts public Trump threat lacks teeth to block impeachment witnesses MORE.\n\nTrump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump threat lacks teeth to block impeachment witnesses Sondland could provide more clues on Ukraine controversy Top US diplomat William Taylor scheduled to testify in impeachment probe MORE have repeatedly raised corruption allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter, without providing specific evidence of them.\n\nMulvaney denied repeatedly during the briefing earlier Thursday that the security aid was tied to an effort to investigate the Bidens, something House Democrats are investigating as part of their impeachment inquiry.\n\nUpdated at 8:03 p.m.", "description": "White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that the flow of security assistance to Ukraine was not conditioned on Kiev investigating a\u00a0theory related to 2016 election interference, walking back sta", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mulvaneymick_101719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
