Innovation once came from within, with a number of early influencers earning god-like status among the crypto community. In 2019, the industry is marching to a very different tune, with tech companies expanding their influence out of their respective sectors and into the realm of finance.\n\nTelegram\u2019s Telegram Open Network (TON), powered by its own in-house cryptocurrency, Gram, hoped to be the first token-backed product for mainstream use launched by an established tech firm. Just days before the launch date, the hammer of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) came down in full force.\n\nMomentum for TON has been building over the past few months and the token distribution set for Oct. 16 was drawing ever nearer. In August and September, Telegram released the TON testnet for both explorer and node software, launched a free wallet service for its 300 million users, and announced a controversial $400,000 bug bounty. Just as everything was falling into place for the company \u2014 the SEC stepped in.\n\nSEC issues Gram restraining order\n\nAlthough many companies have recently launched high-profile cryptocurrency initiatives, TON was scheduled as the first of them to go live for the general public. It seemed that with each passing day, anticipation for the Durov brothers\u2019 latest, secretive project grew. Telegram\u2019s trademark secrecy gave the project an added layer of mystery, building upon the firm\u2019s $1.7 billion ICO in February 2018.\n\nWith its competitors like the Facebook-backed Libra bogged down with lobbying and harsh regulation, it almost looked as if Telegram knew something everyone else didn\u2019t. But the last of their luck would soon run out. Just as the final week before TON\u2019s initial token distribution drew to an uneventful close, the SEC took emergency action.\n\nIn an Oct. 11 press release, the SEC stated that it had filed an emergency action and restraining order against both Telegram and TON with a federal district court in Manhattan. According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that the sale of Gram tokens had not been registered with the regulator.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that the SEC announced it will classify Gram as a security. According to the Securities Act of 1933, all securities must be registered with the commission. On this basis, the SEC declared the sale of the tokens unlawful. Several members of the commission were vocal about their disapproval for TON. Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement maintained that Gram was illegal:\n\n\u201cOur emergency action today is intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold. We allege that the defendants have failed to provide investors with information regarding Grams and Telegram\u2019s business operations, financial condition, risk factors, and management that the securities laws require.\u201d\n\nSteven Peikin, co-director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement appeared to imply that Telegram had avoided undergoing the necessary regulatory diligence:\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly stated that issuers cannot avoid the federal securities laws just by labeling their product a cryptocurrency or a digital token.Telegram seeks to obtain the benefits of a public offering without complying with the long-established disclosure responsibilities designed to protect the investing public.\u201d\n\nDue to the tiny snippets of information released by the company along with a great deal of rumors making their rounds of the crypto community, Telegram\u2019s TON has created a huge amount of discussion. As more information became public and the token distribution date drew nearer, several exchanges stepped forward and announced their willingness to host TON.\n\nOne of the earliest announcements came in early September from Blackmoon, an exchange registered in the Cayman Islands. Just a few days after, California-based Anchor Labs subsidiary, Anchorage Trust Company, threw its hat into the ring, reporting that it would support institutional custody for Gram, despite not being registered with the SEC. The most high-profile show of support came in October, when major U.S.-based crypto exchange and wallet provider Coinbase announced it will provide custodial support for TON once it goes live for the wider public.\n\nOleksandr Lutskevych, CEO and founder of CEX.IO, a London-based exchange that also announced it would provide custodial support to TON, told Cointelegraph that the SEC has surprised everyone with their move, adding that, \u201cThe facts outlined in the complaint do not have a strong foundation, as we\u2019ve encountered previously in other SEC cases.\u201d Lutskevych went on to say that while they do not agree with the SEC decision, they share the commission\u2019s core task of protecting retail investors:\n\n\u201cProbably, their step was the only right action in this situation if we view the case from their perspective. Over the past few weeks, the attention to TON has been incredibly high, and it\u2019s quite easy to understand how many tokens will burst out onto the retail market. On the other hand, such an approach brings lots of questions, and I am looking forward to seeing the results of the court hearing and the argumentation of the TON representatives.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing the importance of complying with legal procedures both within and outside U.S. borders, Lutskevych explained that CEX.IO will still aim to provide custodial services to TON for institutional customers regardless of SEC\u2019s decision:\n\n\u201cThis is a standalone licensed activity that has been approved by the regulator within our business plan. We believe that providing custody services for TON investors does not contradict any rules and laws.\u201d\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\nMany projects claim to have what it takes to transform the industry and even more have earned the praise of critics across the board. Almost all of these projects share another, more unwelcome characteristic: failing to impress the SEC. The commission has an infamous reputation for a lack of regulatory clarity, along with a hostile approach to cryptocurrency-based projects.\n\nThe speed at which the SEC casts its all-important approval varies too, ranging from listless indecision to the explosive and unexpected decision to deny TON at the last minute. One reason that the SEC decided to clamp down on TON may well be due to the way Telegram planned to sell it.\n\nIn February 2019, Telegram filed for a \u201cForm D,\u201d which is an application to sell a security with one crucial difference \u2014 applicants are not obliged to register with the SEC. Although, the Form D is not without its drawbacks. Applicants using this route need to be aware of the two possible exemptions for getting around an SEC registration: 506(b), the more prohibitive of the two, bars the applicant from advertising the security and restricts sales to accredited investors as well as 35 non-accredited investors. The SEC details the desired qualities of non-accredited investors:\n\n\u201cEach purchaser who is not an accredited investor either alone or with his purchaser representative(s) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment.\u201d\n\nTelegram, however, filed for the second option \u2014 506(c). Under the requirements of this exemption, the security is permissible only if sold exclusively to accredited investors, while those applying for this exemption are allowed to advertise.\n\nAlthough the initial sales of Gram tokens would have been made to accredited investors in the initial token offering, the SEC is concerned that these holders might then resell the tokens. Consequently, the commission viewed this as a violation of 506(c):\n\n\u201cOnce Telegram delivers the Grams to the Initial Purchasers, they will be able to resell billions of Grams on the open market to the investing public. Telegram and/or its affiliates will facilitate these sales on digital-asset trading platforms. Once these resales occur, Telegram will have completed its unregistered offering with billions of Grams trading on multiple platforms to a dispersed group of investors.\u201d\n\nChief market analyst at ThinkMarketsFX, Naeem Aslam, told Cointelegraph that he felt the regulations were clear enough, and supported the SEC\u2019s decision:\n\n\u201cI agree that the SEC doesn\u2019t have everything clearly spelled out but there is a strong framework and if companies are breaking it then they should be held accountable.\u201d\n\nNischal Shetty, founder of the India-based WazirX exchange, said that he believes Gram is a utility token rather than a security, but he remains positive about the SEC and Telegram coming to a workable solution:\n\n\u201cSEC might probably have issues with the way Telegram probably represented these to potential investors. Nevertheless, I\u2019m sure Telegram and the SEC will sort this out. The Crypto world needs scalable blockchain projects to launch soon for the next step of evolution and TON promises that.\u201d\n\nNew York Times tech reporter Nathaniel Popper\u2019s Oct. 12 tweet drew attention to the venture capital companies that participated in Telegram\u2019s $1.7 billion ICO:\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s move to shut down Telegram\u2019s crypto project raises questions about the big venture capital firms that gave it $1.7 billion and convinced themselves that it would pass regulatory muster. That includes Benchmark, Sequoia and Lightspeed.\u201d\n\nTelegram responds to investors\n\nAlthough the SEC declaration of the $1.7 billion ICO as illegal may suggest that Telegram simply failed to follow the correct procedures, a TON letter to investors obtained by Cointelegraph states that the firm had been trying to get feedback from the SEC for the past 18 months:\n\n\u201cWe were surprised and disappointed that the SEC chose to file the lawsuit under these circumstances, and we disagree with the SEC\u2019s legal position.\u201d\n\nFollowing the red flag from the SEC, a private Telegram channel for TON investors also took action, citing increased regulatory uncertainty. The TON Board announced a temporary hiatus and deleted all previous posts on its Telegram channel, a space created by and for TON investors as well as for prospective holders of Grams.\n\nWhat do experts think about TON?\n\nTelegram is a company that polarizes opinions. From its disagreements with governments to the secretive ways in which it carries out business, the company both enrages and inspires its audience in equal measure. Decentral Park Capital Senior Research Analyst Elias Simos told Cointelegraph that when the project does finally launch, the shockwaves will be felt across the industry:\n\n\u201cTo put things in context, the Telegram messenger has more than 500x the active end-users of all the apps running currently on Ethereum. The technology architecture is impressive. On the flipside, it is so ambitious that there are many ways in which it could fail \u2014 some of which are failure to decentralize the network sufficiently, failing to attract developers etc. Either way, it is like nothing we have seen before \u2014 and it matters.\u201d\n\nWazirX\u2019s Nischal Shetty also believes that TON is set to shake up the crypto space upon its launch, since Telegram is one of the most technically competent teams in the world, \u201cThey are also one of the most persistent team, they keep building and improving upon the product. TON has the potential to usher in a new and much needed positive push for the entire blockchain industry.\u201d TON has a potential user base of 250 million once it gets the green light from regulators. Simos said this could lead to it becoming the platform of choice for decentralized apps (DApps):\n\n\u201cIf interoperability plays out as intended, I think TON has a shot to becoming the de facto discovery platform for DeFi and other crypto native Dapps. The bot interface is ideal in abstracting away the complexity of blockchain back ends. It\u2019s definitely too early to call for a \u2018Netscape moment,\u2019 but the potential is there.\u201d\n\nValue of TON\n\nRegarding the potential price of the Gram cryptocurrency, Simos explained to Cointelegraph that TON could help monetize the valuable Telegram platform while also providing both an attractive opportunity to run validators for investors and a resourceful public utility to the world:\n\n\u201cBy participating in the Gram private sale, investors effectively purchased the right to run validators on TON and access a stream of ledger fees, at an attractive price. As for the TON Foundation, with 10% of the Gram total supply under their control, at a price of $2 per Gram, this makes for a $1B coffer. The Telegram Messenger reportedly costs $1M a month to run. [...] I see TON both as a play to monetise the messenger, but also as an effort to introduce a public utility in the world; an operating system for payments technology and financial applications.\u201d\n\nHowever, those estimations may be overstated, as Aslam told Cointelegraph regarding the indicative value range of $2.1 to $8.0 per Gram published by ATON Research:\n\n\u201cOnce a token starts trading on an exchange that\u2019s when the conversation truly begins. For the time being sub $2 could be something that we\u2019re really looking at. I think that would be something more justifiable. In terms of a range. I\u2019m really looking at $1.5\u20131.8 rather than $2.1.\u201d\n\nIn the last year, stablecoin projects have erupted across the industry, with Facebook\u2019s Libra project also looking to launch soon. Regarding Telegram\u2019s decision not to peg Gram to any particular fiat currency, eToro Senior Market Analyst Mati Greenspan told Cointelegraph that letting the market decide the price could pay off for the company:\n\n\u201cIt makes a lot of sense to let the market decide what the price should be. This way they don\u2019t need to waste time and energy managing a reserve and will likely face less scrutiny from both regulators and users.\u201d\n\nThinkMarketsFX\u2019s Aslam said that although it is indeed a crypto project being launched by a large, reputable tech firm, it\u2019s not possible to compare TON too closely with its competitors:", "description": "TON was hurtling toward public release until the SEC stopped it dead in its tracks.
