It cost them.", "language": "en", "text": "The key at-bat doesn\u2019t always have to come late, and so here it was in the fourth inning Thursday evening, before the sun had fully set over Dodger Stadium. Walker Buehler, the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 talented right-hander, was struggling with his command. He missed the strike zone badly. He walked the bases loaded.\n\nHere came Asdrubal Cabrera, a veteran hitter whose first postseason at-bat came a dozen years ago. Cabrera\u2019s Washington Nationals trailed 1-0. Tie the game. Take the lead. Either was possible. At the least, though, against a pitcher who couldn\u2019t find the strike zone, take a pitch, right?\n\nCabrera did not. Buehler threw him a curveball in the dirt, what would have been ball one. Cabrera swung through it. Buehler threw him another curveball down and out of the strike zone. Cabrera tapped it meekly back to Buehler. Instead of the count being 2-0, the threat was snuffed.\n\n\u201cIt happens,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cThis game is not easy.\u201d\n\nBuehler and three Dodgers relievers will get be praised for overwhelming the Nationals\u2019 lineup in what became a 6-0 victory in Game 1 of this National League Division Series, and that\u2019s fine. Buehler\u2019s stuff is superior. He was an all-star for a reason. An organization that has only a World Series title as an acceptable conclusion to this October chose him over Clayton Kershaw to open the postseason. He\u2019s good, and he allowed the Nats one measly hit in his six innings. Tip your cap.\n\n[Nats fall to Dodgers, 6-0, in Game 1 of NLDS]\n\nBut it says here that the Nationals helped Buehler at precisely the points he needed a raft. Cabrera\u2019s at-bat, in which he abandoned any identifiable approach, was the most egregious instance \u2014 and really the only pressurized spot the Nats presented. Except it wasn\u2019t just that the Nats managed only Juan Soto\u2019s second-inning single before they were down by six runs. It was that they too often rolled over and said, \u201cPitch me how you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cChased a lot of bad pitches,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cI think at one point, I have to look, but we were way over 20 pitches that we chased, and that\u2019s uncharacteristic of our team.\u201d\n\nCabrera, Victor Robles and Yan Gomes \u2014 who hit sixth through eighth \u2014 went a combined 0 for 9, which is lousy, of course. But those nine at-bats produced one ball hit out of the infield and four strikeouts, including three from Gomes. Soto, the hero of Tuesday\u2019s wild-card win that made this game possible, may still be a tick off because he got a fat pitch from Buehler with two on in the fourth \u2014 and managed only to push it short of the warning track in center, an out instead of a bomb.\n\nJumpy? Tight? Trying too hard?\n\nAll of it.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve kind of done that the last two games,\u201d said shortstop Trea Turner, who provided the Nats\u2019 only other hit, a double leading off the ninth. \u201c. . . Everyone wants to help out. Everyone wants to win. It\u2019s kind of an atmosphere thing.\u201d\n\n[Washington will start Stephen Strasburg in Game 2 of NLDS]\n\nGiven how all this unfolded, it\u2019s hard not to think about the Nats\u2019 previous postseason appearances. Different team and different time, for sure. But in five division series openers, the Nats have now scored a total of eight runs. They\u2019re 1-4 in those games, which means they\u2019re chasing the series more often than not.\n\nThis production comes with offenses that range from good to excellent, too. Washington\u2019s ranks in the National League in runs scored during those seasons: third, fourth, fourth, first and second. Their Game 1 run totals against, respectively, the Cardinals, Giants, Dodgers, Cubs and now Dodgers again: 3, 2, 3, 0 and 0. In those five games, they have produced a .170 average and a .239 slugging percentage.\n\nYeah, yeah, small sample size and all that. Still, there has to be something about the postseason that affects players individually and teams as a whole. Yes, it can be good pitching beating good hitting, a truism even if the ball is juiced, as it is this season. But when good pitching gets help beating good hitting, well, then there\u2019s no chance.\n\n[Dodgers\u2019 Buehler delivers when called upon]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the ball in the strike zone,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s the key. When we swing at balls in the strike zone, we put the ball in play. We\u2019ve got to relax.\u201d\n\nThis version of the Nationals\u2019 lineup can be dangerous because, at its best, it has both balance and depth. Trea Turner to Adam Eaton to Anthony Rendon to Soto to Howie Kendrick to Cabrera to Robles provides alternating right-left-right-left hitters through the first seven spots. On Thursday, Gomes started at catcher, in large part because he caught every one of Patrick Corbin\u2019s starts this season. But the eighth-place hitter also salvaged his offensive season over the final month-and-a-half, posting a .922 on-base-plus-slugging percentage with six homers since Aug. 17.\n\n[NLDS Game 1 Box score: Dodgers 6, Nationals 0]\n\nOn Thursday, the lineup looked neither deep nor dangerous. There are other things to pick at, and certainly the idea of using rookie Tanner Rainey and septuagenarian Fernando Rodney in the seventh inning of a 2-0 game is foremost among them. Those two pitchers \u2014 along with Hunter Strickland and Wander Suero \u2014 shouldn\u2019t sniff the mound unless the Nats trail by, say, five runs. In a five-game series, the best relievers are always rested because there are never three games in a row. Use Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson if you\u2019re interested in keeping the game close.\n\nThat point, though, is moot if the Nats can\u2019t score runs.\n\nMartinez has some options to stir things up. The Dodgers will throw Hall of Famer-to-be Kershaw in Friday\u2019s Game 2. Veteran first baseman Ryan Zimmerman is 12 for 34 (.353) with a homer and two doubles against Kershaw, so he should start at first, benching Kendrick \u2014 which at the very least upgrades Washington\u2019s defense. Martinez could think about Gerardo Parra as a replacement for Eaton because, even from the left side, Parra is comfortable with Kershaw \u2014 13 for 41 (.317) with two doubles, a triple and a homer. Even reserve first baseman Matt Adams, another left-handed hitter, has history with Kershaw \u2014 a massive, game-changing three-run homer in the 2014 postseason.\n\nBut the numbers that should be pored over and considered every which way can\u2019t tell what a given hitter will do in a given situation. One game doesn\u2019t mean: Freak out. What it does mean: Be yourselves. Do what you normally do. Swing at your pitch, not his. Good pitching might beat you. But goodness gracious, don\u2019t help it along.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.", "description": "With Dodgers starter Walker Buehler struggling, lack of patience at the plate costs Washington.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "October At Am", "Barry Svrluga Became A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post In December He Arrived At The Post In To Cover Football", "Basketball At The University Of Maryland", "Has Covered The Washington Nationals"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0xEb07trBYm7kpD41rO2OSHbBss=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZPMFE2HGNII6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
