Sparks then went into the boys\u2019 bedroom and separately took them into the kitchen, where he stabbed them. Raekwon was stabbed at least 45 times. Authorities say Sparks then raped his 12- and 14-year-old stepdaughters.\n\nHis attorneys are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, alleging his trial jury was improperly influenced because a bailiff wore a necktie with an image of a syringe that showed his support for the death penalty. Sparks also alleges a prosecution witness at his trial provided false testimony regarding his prison classification if a jury chose life without parole rather than a death sentence.\n\nLower courts and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles have turned down requests by Sparks\u2019 attorneys to stop his execution.\n\nIf the execution happens, Sparks would be the 16th inmate put to death this year in the U.S. and the seventh in Texas. Seven more executions are scheduled in Texas this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to stop his execution on claims he\u2019s intellectually disabled, saying his attorneys had not presented sufficient evidence to show Sparks is mentally disabled and had failed to raise such a claim in a timely manner.\n\nIn August, the 5th Circuit did grant a stay for Dexter Johnson, another Texas death row inmate who also claims he is intellectually disabled. In that case, the appeals court ruled Johnson had made a sufficient showing of possible intellectual disability that needed further review.\n\nAfter his arrest, Sparks told police he fatally stabbed his wife and stepsons because he believed they were trying to poison him. Sparks told a psychologist that a voice told him \u201cto kill them because they were trying to kill me.\u201d\n\nSparks\u2019 lawyers have argued he suffers from severe mental illness and has been diagnosed as a delusion psychotic and with schizoaffective disorder, a condition characterized by hallucinations.\n\nA psychologist hired by Sparks\u2019 attorneys said in an affidavit this month that Sparks \u201cmeets full criteria for a diagnosis of\u201d intellectual disability.\n\n\u201cWithout a stay of execution, it is likely that Texas will execute an intellectually disabled man,\u201d Seth Kretzer and Jonathan Landers, Sparks\u2019 appellate attorneys, wrote last month in court documents.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2002 barred execution of mentally disabled people but has given states some discretion to decide how to determine intellectual disability. However, justices have wrestled with how much discretion to allow.\n\nThe Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office, which called the killings \u201cmonstrous crimes,\u201d said in court documents that Sparks\u2019 \u201cown trial expert testified that he was not intellectually disabled.\u201d\n\nHis attorneys said that at the time of his trial, Sparks was not deemed intellectually disabled, but changes since then in how Texas makes such determinations and updates to the handbook used by medical professionals to diagnose mental disorders would change that.\n\nOn whether Sparks\u2019 jury was improperly influenced by the bailiff\u2019s necktie with an image of a syringe, the attorney general\u2019s office said the jury foreperson indicated she never saw the tie and had no knowledge of it affecting the jurors.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office said the testimony from the prosecution witness on prison classification was corrected on cross-examination.\n\n\u201cSparks committed a heinous crime which resulted in the murders of two young children. He is unable to overcome the overwhelming testimony\u201d in his case, the attorney general\u2019s office said in its court filing with the Supreme Court.\n\n___\n\nLozano reported from Houston.\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.
