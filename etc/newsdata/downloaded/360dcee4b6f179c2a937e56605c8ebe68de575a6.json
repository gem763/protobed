cut down for pasture.\n\nA 2016 report from the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organisation linked 80 per cent of deforestation in the country to cattle grazing.\n\nThe sudden rise in fires prompted world leaders and celebrities to issue warnings about the future of the world\u2019s biggest rainforest.\n\nMany took aim at Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s policies, which also included slashing the budget of environmental protection agencies.\n\nThe Brazilian president dismissed the boycott concerns over the weekend, saying it was just some \u201cpressure\u201d and \u201cpart of the game\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address

Because of the company\u2019s size, even minor decisions about its supply chain can have far-reaching effects.\n\nAt the same time, fast fashion retailers like H&M have attracted growing criticism in recent years for their environmental impact by generating waste with cheap, disposable clothing. Some companies have responded in part by introducing recycling programmes and drumming up publicity around new sustainability initiatives.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "H&M, the world\u2019s second-biggest fashion retailer, has said that it will\u00a0stop\u00a0purchasing leather from Brazil over concerns that the country\u2019s cattle industry has contributed to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.", "authors": ["Manuela Andreoni", "Sapna Maheshwari"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/17/brazil.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
