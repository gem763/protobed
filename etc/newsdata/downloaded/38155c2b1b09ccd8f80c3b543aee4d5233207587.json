The deposition has not been previously reported.\n\nGorsky, citing \u201cthousands of tests and studies\u201d to support his testimony, said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of our baby powder or talc containing asbestos.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s harder for him to say now. Last Wednesday, just 13 days after his deposition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told the healthcare giant it had discovered asbestos, a known carcinogen, in a bottle of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.\n\nStocks in this Article JNJ JOHNSON & JOHNSON $129.20 +1.18 (+0.92%)\n\nOn Friday, a day after getting the full FDA test results, J&J recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder in the United States. It marked the first time the company has recalled Baby Powder for possible asbestos contamination and the first time U.S. regulators have announced finding asbestos in the product.\n\nThe recall is the latest blow to a healthcare conglomerate that has for many years tried to project an image as a caring company. It is now facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including legal action by more than 15,000 consumers claiming its talc powders caused their cancers.\n\nShares in J&J, which in February said it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations, dropped almost 6% on Friday after the recall was announced. The inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J&J has been about the safety of its powders, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn the deposition, Gorsky was pressed again and again to say - without qualification - that the company\u2019s powders were asbestos free. But in answering questions under oath for the first time in the talc litigation, he stuck to his statement that he \u201cbelieved\u201d J&J\u2019s powders were clean.\n\nThe FDA finding will make it much more difficult for Gorsky and the company to continue saying that they \u201cbelieve\u201d the talc powders are free from asbestos, said Elizabeth Burch, a product liability expert at the University of Georgia School of Law. She said the test result and recall lend credibility to what plaintiffs have been arguing in court for months.\n\nJ&J stands behind the safety of its talc and said it\u2019s investigating the FDA test result. The company said it proceeded with the recall \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Sunday J&J said: \u201cThousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos, including prior tests by the FDA as recently as last month.\u201d\n\nIn a written response to questions from Reuters on Monday, J&J added that Gorsky had no knowledge of the FDA finding of asbestos at the time of his deposition.\n\nThe company also said the FDA notified it on Sept. 20 that a test of its Baby Powder did not find any asbestos. Neither had the regulator detected asbestos during testing in 2010 using the \u201cmost sophisticated testing techniques available.\u201d\n\nCould be deposed again\n\nGorsky\u2019s testimony echoed statements he made after Reuters on Dec. 14 last year published an investigation that found J&J knew for decades asbestos lurked in its talc.\n\nInternal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company\u2019s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, the Reuters investigation found. Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.\n\nJim Kramer, the lawyer who deposed Gorsky this month, said he plans to ask the New York state judge in the case to allow him to question the CEO a second time in light of the FDA\u2019s findings and the recall.\n\nJ&J declined to comment on the possibility of a second round with Kramer or about its legal strategy following the FDA test result.\n\nGorsky faces at least one more deposition, this one ordered by a Missouri judge for Baby Powder cancer cases pending in that state. That has yet to be scheduled.\n\nDiscussed dropping talc powders\n\nIn his daylong videotaped deposition, Gorsky, a former Army Ranger, recounted his efforts to stem the growing controversy over one of the company\u2019s signature products.\n\nSitting at the head of a conference table with the blinds drawn in the midtown Manhattan offices of a mediation firm, he testified that J&J considered dropping talc powders.\n\n\u201cWe had discussions internally along the way regarding should we leave \u2026 talc on the market or not,\u201d Gorsky said at the deposition.\n\nIn the end, however, Gorsky said the company, which also sells Baby Powder made from cornstarch, stuck with talc because it was confident about its safety and because many consumers liked its feel.\n\n\u201cWe had the right testing procedures in place and so there was \u2026 no medical reason or safety reason to withdraw it,\u201d he testified.\n\n\u201cThere were in fact differences between cornstarch and talc-based baby powder in its feel, in its absorbency,\u201d said Gorsky, who has been J&J\u2019s CEO since 2012. The company \u201cfelt it was important to have different options on the market based upon different consumer needs.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s lawyer pressed the 59-year-old Gorsky on his use of the word \u201cbelieve\u201d when asked about asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc. \u201cMy follow up is,\u201d Kramer said, \u201ccan you not answer the question as I\u2019ve presented it with a yes or a no?\u201d\n\nGorsky, who said in the deposition he uses Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder and had also used it on his son, didn\u2019t budge. \u201cI did not personally conduct every single test. I can only \u2026 gauge it based upon the data and totality that\u2019s been presented to me.\u201d\n\nIn its answers to Reuters questions on Monday, the company reiterated that \u201cMr. Gorsky is not a scientist and did not conduct the tests. He therefore relies on others to advise him.\u201d\n\nBefore the FDA test result, Gorsky\u2019s focus on what he \u201cbelieved\u201d to be true was helpful to J&J\u2019s legal position, said Andrew Bradt, a Berkeley Law professor at the University of California. Many state laws require plaintiffs to prove companies knew a product was defective, and if Gorsky had unequivocally said talc does not contain asbestos then opposing lawyers could seek to undermine his declaration by contrasting it with the results of tests J&J knew about over the years suggesting otherwise.\n\nHowever, in light of the FDA asbestos discovery, plaintiff lawyers could now make it sound like he was being hesitant in his deposition, Bradt said.\n\n'Mad money'\n\nMuch of the testimony centered on Gorsky\u2019s efforts to quell public and investor concerns raised by the Dec. 14 Reuters investigation and a story published hours later in the New York Times. The Reuters report had prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from the company\u2019s market value in one day.\n\nIn the subsequent days, J&J tweeted, posted on Facebook, ran a series of full-page newspaper ads, published a lengthy rebuttal to the Reuters investigation on its website and announced a $5 billion stock buyback.\n\nIn video posted in December and still featured on J&J\u2019s website, Gorsky emphasized that regulators \u201chave always found our talc to be asbestos free.\u201d\n\nJim Cramer, the host of the CNBC investing show \u201cMad Money,\u201d gave Gorsky the chance to present his side of the story last December, according to copies of emails shown at the deposition.\n\nHours after the Reuters and New York Times articles were published, Cramer sent a message to Gorsky\u2019s work email, saying: \u201cDear Alex, if you feel these talc stories are not truthful, I would love to know how to refute them! \u2013 all the best, Jim.\u201d\n\nAnd that evening, Cramer sent a followup: \u201cThank you, Alex. Do not be afraid to overwhelm me. I will work all weekend to tell the truth about your great company!!! -Jim.\u201d\n\nGorsky appeared in person in the \u201cMad Money\u201d studio the following Monday, Dec. 17.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that our trust and integrity that we\u2019ve earned over the last 130 years is maintained for the next 130 years,\u201d he told viewers.\n\n\u201cWe unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos,\u201d Gorsky said on the broadcast.\n\nIn an email to Reuters, Cramer said his goal \u201cwas to get Alex Gorsky on CNBC first and to ask all the toughest questions \u2026 There were no ground rules and nothing was off the table.\u201d At the end of the Dec. 17 broadcast, there was a disclosure that Cramer\u2019s charitable trust owned J&J shares.\n\nIt still has a stake today, Cramer said.\n\nTesting accuracy\n\nWhen the question of previous test results came up in the deposition, Gorsky said occasional findings of asbestos in talc haven\u2019t held up under scrutiny. Such tests were subsequently found to be \u201cincomplete or inaccurate,\u201d he said.\n\nA New Jersey judge overseeing thousands of talc lawsuits consolidated in a federal court is expected to rule soon on a J&J request to disqualify expert witnesses hired by plaintiffs, including the head of an asbestos testing lab who testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in the company\u2019s powders.\n\nIn a filing Friday, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers drew the judge\u2019s attention to the FDA finding of asbestos in the bottle of Baby Powder and said they have asked J&J to turn over documents related to the FDA test results and any communications with regulators.\n\nIn a brief conference call Friday with analysts and journalists, J&J officials called the FDA test results \u201cextremely unusual,\u201d and suggested the sample may have been contaminated by an outside source or come from a counterfeit bottle.\n\nA few hours later, the FDA shot back with a defense of its laboratory analysis, saying it wasn\u2019t aware of \u201cany records pointing to counterfeit Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder in the U.S. market.\u201d\n\nThe FDA declined to provide further comment for this article.", "description": "Facing off against a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer for the first time about Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, the company\u2019s Chief Executive Alex Gorsky earlier this month insisted that the company\u2019s iconic brand was safe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Gorsky-Baby-Power.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
