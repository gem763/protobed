The insurers had recommended replacing them with \u201cimmediate annuities,\u201d in which payments start after 13 months.\n\nBut the insurers did not properly disclose information to consumers about income they would receive from the two different types of annuities and whether the replacement annuity was suitable, the regulator said. The recommendation to switch could cost consumers \u201csubstantial lifetime income,\u201d NYDFS said.\n\nCompanion Life Insurance Co in Columbia, South Carolina, is to return to New York consumers $462,122 of the total and pay a $186,000 penalty, the largest share of the total amount, followed by the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company in Horsham, Pennsylvania, which agreed to return $322,584 and pay a $133,000 penalty.\n\nThe Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company Inc agreed to return $218,589 and pay a $224,000 penalty.\n\nOther insurers are Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co, The Prudential Insurance Companyof America [PRUXBA.UL], and The United States Life Insurance Company. Prudential Insurance Company of America is a unit of Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N). The insurers agreed to revise their disclosure statements, the regulator said.", "description": "Six U.S. life insurers have agreed to pay a total of $1.83 million for improperly causing customers to switch their existing annuities to a different type that generated less income, New York State's financial regulator said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Suzanne Barlyn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
