According to the Human Sciences Research Council and the South African Institute of Race Relations, 60% of children in the county have absent fathers.\n\nHis plan\n\nThis isn\u2019t Masango\u2019s first feat \u2013 in 2017 he embarked on 100km walk from Polokwane to Tzaneen in solidarity with fathers who don\u2019t have access to their children. He urges men to take centre stage and be involved in their children\u2019s lives to avoid raising a generation of fatherless children.\n\nMasango plans to complete his latest 3 400km journey in two and half weeks and would also like to summit Mount Kilimanjaro. \u201cI will be cycling from Tzaneen to Tanzania to climb Kilimanjaro. I\u2019m running a project called Presence in Fatherhood, an initiative that was birthed from my experience where I was denied access to my son after parting ways with his mother.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s development\n\nHis main objective, he says, is to have men be actively involved in their children\u2019s lives. He adds that absent fathers leave an impact on a child\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cFathers who are not involved in their children\u2019s lives affect their holistic development. Fathers are important, they instil confidence, [a] sense of self-worth, and pride in their children.\u201d\n\nAccording to the South African Journal of Childhood Education physical, mental health, social competence, IQ and other learning outcomes of children whose fathers are not involved in their socio-educational development have been reported to be poorer compared with children whose fathers are physically present and participating in the processes and programmes of their development.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s man up. Let\u2019s take responsibility, we brought these kids to earth. It doesn\u2019t matter the circumstances surrounding the conception of their birth. At the end of the day, [it] is your child and you have to make it a point that you are involved,\u201d he says.\n\nPreparation\n\nThe Tanzania expedition, he adds, could have happened eight years ago but he didn\u2019t feel he was ready. He says that people need be mentally and physically prepared to undertake such an excruciating expedition.\n\n\u201cAs a fitness trainer, I have a training programme. I did weight and cardio workouts and cycling to prepare for this trip. I didn\u2019t have a special diet as eating healthy is a lifestyle for me and for someone to embark on a journey like this, one must have an active lifestyle and be adventurous.\u201d He has started his journey on September 24, Heritage Day.\n\n\u2013 Health-e News\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Fitness trainer, Nyiko Masango, is cycling from Tzaneen to Tanzania to raise awareness about absentee fathers.", "authors": ["Mogale Mojelamasango"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9432/39a44c9a0ad84c6f9f72ea559026f53b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
