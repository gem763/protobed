Turnout was low, however, with the violence - plus earlier Taliban threats against polling stations - likely contributing factors.\n\nVoting was extended by two hours, as the start of polling was delayed around the country with stations failing to open on time amid technical problems.\n\nIndependent election observers and activists said a slow pace to voting triggered confusion at some polling stations, with long queues forming outside.\n\n\u201cIt took the first voter 31 minutes to vote. For subsequent voters it was taking around five minutes and then it started to streamline to 3 minutes and 30 seconds,\u201d said Nishank Motwani, an observer stationed in Kabul.\n\n\u201cElection commission staff looked panicked and voters were getting angry that the queue was not moving.\u201d\n\nTALIBAN INTERVENTION?\n\nSome observers feared the Taliban had forced a partial shutdown to upset the final results as the Independent Election Commission\u2019s (IEC), without giving a reason, said it had failed to establish contact with 901 of the 4,942 polling centres.\n\nThe hardline Islamist group, which controls more of the country than at any time since its regime fell in 2001, has warned the more than 9 million registered voters to stay at home or face dire consequences.\n\nSaturday\u2019s presidential vote is the fourth since the Taliban were toppled.\n\nA dozen candidates are vying for the presidency, led by incumbent Ashraf Ghani and his former deputy Abdullah Abdullah. Due to logistical difficulties, results will not be known until Nov. 7.\n\nThe winner will play a crucial role in the country\u2019s quest to end the war with the Taliban and any resumption of talks between them and the United States that were called off this month.\n\nTo protect voters and polling stations, tens of thousands of troops were deployed.\n\nAbdul Moqim Abdulrahimzai, director-general of operations and planning at the Interior Ministry, said at least 21 civilians and two Afghan forces were injured in about a dozen small-scale attacks during the first hours of voting. Other attacks had been foiled, he said.\n\nA senior Western security official in Kabul said the Taliban had not conducted large-scale attacks but had scared some voters away.\n\nEarly turnout was \u201cvery poor\u201d, said the Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan, also citing as a reason the requirement for voters to be photographed, to which female voters in conservative areas objected.\n\nOthers were determined to vote.\n\n\u201cBravado gets defined when one musters courage to cast ones vote,\u201d said Kabul doctor Roya Jahangir (after casting his ballot?). \u201cWe hope this time there is no fraud.\u201d\n\nHundreds of voters complained their names were missing from voters\u2019 lists or the biometric devices used to prevent fraud. Addressing those concerns, the IEC eased restrictions, allowing anyone with election stickers on their national identity cards to vote.\n\nAfghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah poses as he casts his vote at a polling station in Kabul, Afghanistan September 28, 2019. REUTERS/Omar Sobhani\n\nPOLLING STATIONS ATTACKED\n\nSmall-scale Taliban attacks took place across the country.\n\nAn explosion at a polling station in a mosque in the southern city of Kandahar wounded 16 people, according to a security source.\n\nIn the northern province of Faryab, Afghan forces clashed with Taliban fighters in six districts, forcing people to stay indoors and refrain from voting.\n\nThe Taliban said their fighters attacked polling stations in Laghman province, in eastern Afghanistan. Officials said four explosions in the eastern city of Jalalabad, in which one person was killed, disrupted voting at some stations.\n\nBlasts also hit Kabul and Ghazni, officials said, while more than 400 polling centres remained closed because they were in areas under Taliban control.\n\nWestern diplomats said the scale of the Islamist militant group\u2019s election attacks would determine whether talks with Washington resumed.\n\n\u201cTalks can only begin if the Taliban exercises restraint and allows people to vote,\u201d said one diplomat overseeing the elections.\n\nGhani cast his ballot in a Kabul high school, telling reporters: \u201cI thank God that today that people\u2019s vote will help the republic of Afghanistan to move forward.\u201d\n\nAbdullah voted at a different Kabul school. \u201cThe threats to innocent people do not show the strength of the Taliban,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth men came to power in 2014 after a bitterly contested election marred by fraud.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s political scene is still tainted by the aftermath of that vote, which forced the two main rival groupings to form an unstable partnership. Both sides were accused of massive electoral cheating.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nGender break-up across polling centres - here\n\nGender disparity of Afghanistan\u2019s electorate - here", "description": "Afghans braved the threat of militant attacks and delays at polling booths to vote in a presidential election on Saturday, a major test of the Western-backed government's ability to protect democracy against Taliban attempts to derail it.", "authors": ["Abdul Qadir Sediqi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434823578&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R04N", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
