Friday\u2019s launch is a test and will only be visible to some users in the US.\n\nThe initiative is designed to quell criticism on two fronts: by promoting higher quality journalism over misinformation and by appeasing news publishers who have long complained that Facebook profits from journalism without paying for it. The company will pay some publishers between $1m and $3m each year to feature their articles, according to Bloomberg.\n\nParticipating publications include the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, BuzzFeed, Bloomberg and ABC News, as well as local newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and Dallas Morning News.\n\nFacebook isn't going to influence the next election \u2013 until it does | Alex Hern Read more\n\nFacebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, paid tribute to the importance of \u201chigh quality\u201d journalism in an op-ed published in the New York Times, which referenced \u201chow the news has held Facebook accountable when we\u2019ve made mistakes\u201d.\n\nZuckerberg also alluded to the power that Facebook will have to influence the media, stating: \u201cIf a publisher posts misinformation, it will no longer appear in the product.\u201d\n\nThe op-ed does not reference the inclusion of Breitbart News, but the outlet is notorious for its role in promoting extreme rightwing narratives and conspiracy theories. Thousands of major advertisers have blacklisted the site over its extreme views.\n\nFounded in 2005 by conservative writer Andrew Breitbart, Breitbart News achieved greater influence and a wider audience under its executive chairman Steve Bannon, who went on to run Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016. For years, the publication used a \u201cblack crime\u201d tag on articles and promoted anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the platform for the alt-right,\u201d Bannon told a reporter in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, BuzzFeed News reported on emails and documents showing how the former Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos had worked directly with a white nationalist and a neo-Nazi to write and edit an article defining the \u201calt-right\u201d movement and advancing its ideas.\n\nFacebook has long faced scrutiny for its reticence to police white nationalism and far-right hate on its platform. In July 2017, the Guardian provided Facebook with a list of 175 pages and groups run by hate groups, as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center, including neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups. The company removed just nine of them.\n\nFollowing the deadly \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville in August 2017 \u2013 which was organized in part on a Facebook event page \u2013 the company cracked down on some white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups. Enforcement was spotty, however, and a year after Charlottesville, several groups and individuals involved in Charlottesville were back on Facebook. It was not until March 2019 that the company decided that its policy against hate should include white nationalism, an ideology that promotes the exclusion and expulsion of non-white people from certain nations.\n\nFacebook declined to provide a full list of the participating publications or offer further comment.\n\nAsked about the inclusion of Breitbart News at a launch event for Facebook News in New York, Zuckerberg declined to comment on \u201cany specific firm\u201d but added, \u201cI do think that part of having this be a trusted source is that it needs to have a diversity of \u2026 views in there. I think you want to have content that kind of represents different perspectives, but also in a way that complies with the standards that we have.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook CEO faced harsh questioning from lawmakers this week, when he testified at a hearing of the US House of Representatives financial services committee. Though the hearing was putatively about Facebook\u2019s plans to launch a cryptocurrency, several representatives pressed Zuckerberg on his company\u2019s poor track record on complying with US civil rights laws, as well as policing hate speech.\n\nDuring an exchange about the company\u2019s decision to allow politicians to promote misinformation in paid advertising, the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pressed Zuckerberg on the inclusion of the Daily Caller, which she called \u201ca publication with well-documented ties to white supremacists\u201d, in the company\u2019s third-party fact-checker program. In 2018, the Atlantic revealed that a former deputy editor of the Daily Caller also wrote under a pseudonym for a white supremacist publication.", "description": "The social media site has received backlash over its choice to include a publication that has been called \u2018the platform for the alt-right\u2019", "authors": ["Julia Carrie Wong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f36df329895dc5839d73b0c4a55ef763e5af184/0_154_5508_3305/master/5508.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7f4e2b2c9f668ab362aa692d08f0801c", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
