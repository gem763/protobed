And \u2026 I\u2019m not just saying this because she\u2019s my girlfriend. \u2026 She has a credit on the album itself. And it\u2019s not just a kind of shoutout. It\u2019s genuine, you know, work.\u201d\n\nDavid Crotty via Getty Images James Blake and Jameela Jamil at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in February.\n\nWhen the Billboard interviewer asked if Jamil joins him on tour, Blake made it crystal clear that his talented girlfriend is busy navigating her own successful life.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s busy speaking at the U.N. and doing way more important shit than going around with me,\u201d Blake said with a laugh.\n\nAfter the interview was published on Twitter, Blake retweeted it Monday and emphasized his sentiments.\n\n\u201cNot just inspired it \u2014 she actually worked on it,\u201d Blake wrote. \u201cI even said it in the interview, but people focus on \u2018inspired\u2019 because the idea of the \u2018muse\u2019 is so romantic and pervasive.\u201d\n\nNot just inspired it - she actually worked on it.

In another tweet, he pointed out that the female partners of male musicians typically act as \u201ca sounding board\u201d and offer the only \u201cemotional support during the process.\u201d And sadly, they \u201calmost invariably go uncredited, while majority male producers come in and make a tiny change to a track and they\u2019re Mr. golden balls.\u201d\n\nIn addition, women who help their partners with their album, being a sounding board and often their only emotional support during the process, almost invariably go uncredited, while majority male producers come in and make a tiny change to a track and they\u2019re Mr. golden balls. \u2014 James Blake (@jamesblake) October 7, 2019\n\nBlake ended his thread by giving a shoutout to all the underappreciated muses out there.\n\nShout out to all the partners who selflessly placated a musician during a very self absorbed process like creating an album, who got the title \u2018muse\u2019 afterwards which basically amounts to being an object of affection while the musician exercises their \u2018genius\u2019. \u2014 James Blake (@jamesblake) October 7, 2019\n\nMany people on Twitter \u2014 including musicians and people who work in the entertainment industry \u2014 loved the musician\u2019s remarks. And in turn, many pointed out contributions that women behind the scenes rarely get credited for.\n\nwow.. i love you for speaking on this \u2014 Rose \ud83e\udd40 (@babyrosemusic) October 7, 2019\n\nI love this... my wife is a massive reason why I\u2019ve even got the finish line on allot of the music I\u2019m releasing https://t.co/rX2crC9em7 \u2014 Labrinth (@Labrinth) October 7, 2019\n\nYes! @xnikulit is a great source of support as I\u2019m creating my music \u2665\ufe0f\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s there through \u2018Draft Recording #1\u2019 to \u2018Final Mastered Version #20\u2019 https://t.co/s7YB86v9TT \u2014 ELMER ABAPO (@ElmerAbapo) October 8, 2019\n\nI\u2019m keeping this in mind when I drop music: any girls, all my homies, and anyone that was there providing emotional support and letting me bounce my feelings off of you to write lyrics will be credited!
