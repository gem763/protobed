Peace on Purpose\u2019s mission is to equip aid workers with the tools to care for themselves so they can effectively care for others.\n\n\u201c\n\nlululemon and the UN Foundation share a commitment to building community and developing collaborative solutions for some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues,\u201d said Calvin McDonald, CEO of lululemon. \u201c\n\nWith increasing need for international humanitarian aid and peacekeeping, we want to cultivate the long-lasting benefits of mindfulness tools and sustain support for those whose mission is to serve others.\u201d\n\n\u201c\n\nUN workers are on the front lines of global challenges, helping people in their times of greatest need,\u201d said Kathy Calvin, President and CEO of the UN Foundation. \u201c\n\nThis work can often be stressful, and the UN has made it a priority to address the well-being of its people. Innovative partnerships like Peace on Purpose can support the UN workers who support the world. With lululemon\u2019s support, we will be able to grow the program to help more UN staff care for themselves and for others.\u201d\n\nPeace on Purpose is a result of a three-year pilot led by lululemon\u2019s Here to Be team and the UN Foundation, developed to address a series of issues, such as burnout, compassion fatigue, and stress-related physical, mental, and relational effects reported by UN staff members. Peace on Purpose has worked with UN agencies to build out trainings and workshops for more than 650 staff in US headquarters and seven additional countries \u2013 Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, South Sudan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Zimbabwe.\n\nResearch that followed select trainings found that over half of the participants experienced a more than 40 percent improvement in overall well-being as seen in key psychological risk factors, such as work-related self-compassion, anxiety and depression, symptoms related to trauma, and feelings of distress.\n\nHumanitarian aid workers report experiencing high rates of burnout, stress, and mental health stigmas in difficult global settings. Peace on Purpose\u2019s curriculum introduces mindfulness tools as well-being resources to support current UN mental health programs. These tools \u2013 such as mindful breaths, emotion regulation, and yoga \u2013 can be implemented to meet the varying needs of UN staff in the diverse environments in which they operate.\n\nWith lululemon\u2019s continued funding commitment and thought partnership, Peace on Purpose will aim to train 3,000 more UN development and humanitarian workers in-person over the next three years, build a hub of digital resources, and develop condensed trainings and curriculum translations to reach an additional 30,000 UN staff.", "description": "With funding commitment from lululemon, Peace on Purpose aims to train and equip more than 3,000 aid workers and reach 30,000 UN staff over the next three years with mindfulness and self-care tools VANCOUVER, British Columbia-(BUSINESS WIRE)-lululemon and the United Nations Foundation today announced", "authors": ["John Jannarone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eaa47UsqrT0BEN0c7VR1Aw--~B/aD0xNTA7dz0xNTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/corpgov_com_597/7cff37c9632faa7b6a8c831be387c75b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
