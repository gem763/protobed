After a scuffle ensued between the two following Katie\u2019s discovery, the floor gave way and she fell to her death.\n\nDue to Katie\u2019s corpse having been seen on-screen, chances of the character making a proper return to the soap are limited, but actress Sammy, 33, has revealed to Inside Soap that she was asked return to the Dales a couple of years back as a ghost.\n\nShe said: \u2018About a year after I left Emmerdale, they asked me to return as a ghost.\u2019\n\n\u2018It was for a scene or two with Andy. I was working, so I couldn\u2019t fit it in.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, while Sammy was unavailable at the time due to other commitments, she revealed she\u2019d very much be up for making a brief return now.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d be up for a cheeky little ghost appearance now \u2013 if only Kelvin [Fletcher] was still in Emmerdale.\n\nKatie\u2019s death came as a shock to soap fans \u2014 especially considering she\u2019d been a part of the soap for over 14 years. However, Sammy spoke about how she\u2019s happy that Katie met her maker.\n\nShe said: \u2018I get asked all the time when I\u2019m coming back to Emmerdale, and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m dead!\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m glad they killed Katie off \u2013 it meant it was more final for me. Now, I\u2019m not always wondering if I should go back.\u2019\n\n\u2018When they told me, at the end of my time at Emmerdale, that Katie would be killed off, it made sense.\n\n\u2018When I said to them that I wanted to leave, Katie and Andy were properly back together after all of that drama \u2013 and I don\u2019t think she would have left him, unless she died.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sammy was asked to make a couple of appearances after her character's demise.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88036985_1570038387.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
