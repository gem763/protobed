Macroeconomics, geopolitics and technical analysis all point to a downward trajectory for the once powerful European currency.\n\nBefore the 2008 crash, sterling traded above $2.1, which is more than 90 cents, or 43% higher. However, since 1985, the $1.4 level has been a staunch support that gave no quarter. This floor was breached for the first time in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote.\n\nAccording to technical dynamics that presume a broken support turns to resistance, it seems like everything is lining up for a resumption of the pound collapse: the pound challenged the newly-flipped resistance of $1.4 from January to April. However, it completed a H&S continuation pattern in May, demonstrating that what has been a floor for 31 years has now become a ceiling.\n\nGBP Daily Chart\n\nGBP has been down-trending within a clearly defined channel since the January-May H&S. The channel\u2019s resistance is underlined by the 50 DMA. Today\u2019s trading posted a new trough in the downtrend.\n\nDespite that, both the MACD and RSI are far from oversold levels, leaving a lot of room for continued decline with no correction. Additionally, both indicators recently provided sell signals.\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nConservative traders would wait for a close near the bottom of the session, to bolster the new trough\u2019s signal of a continued downtrend, followed by a correction to the top of the channel that would prove its resistance, with at least one long red candle engulfing a green or small candle of either color.\n\nModerate traders may be content with the intraday lower trough, followed by the upward correction toward the channel top, but not necessarily for trend confirmation as much as for a better entry.\n\nTrade Sample \u2013 Short Position Setup\n\nEntry: 1.2200\n\nStop-Loss: 1.2250\n\nRisk: 50 pips\n\nTarget: 1.2000\n\nReward: 200 pips\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:4\n\nAggressive traders may enter a contrarian long position, hoping for a dead cat bounce after a straight five-day decline, which is testing the August lows, the previous trough. Then, they could short along with moderate traders.\n\nTrade Sample \u2013 Long Position Setup\n\nEntry: 1.1990\n\nStop-Loss: 1.1950, below today\u2019s lows\n\nRisk: 40 pips\n\nTarget: 1.2110\n\nReward: 120 pips\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3", "description": "Forex Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: GBP/USD.
