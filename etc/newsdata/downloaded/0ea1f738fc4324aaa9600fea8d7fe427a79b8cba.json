The future will show, however, \u201cthat the current block size may actually be \u2018too big,\u2019\u201d he noted.\n\nMow\u2019s comments are in stark contrast with the often quoted narrative among commentators who worry that Bitcoin\u2019s network capacity will fail to deal with future increases in demand.\n\nMow champions the Lightning Network for Bitcoin\n\nBlocks are currently around 1 megabyte in size. Off-chain transactions do not contribute to network load by filling them up, and hence the technology which allows them is seeing considerable development.\n\nFor Mow, the LN represents the most likely winner. The protocol allows almost instant off-chain Bitcoin transactions which can cost just 1 satoshi ($0.00007944 at press time). Its popularity remains limited due to its experimental nature and lack of user-friendly interface, but adoption must continue in order to advance the LN\u2019s status. Mow explained:\n\n\u201cLightning has to grow organically, there's no real way to jumpstart it artificially. People need to open up channels, lock up Bitcoins and start connecting with other nodes.\u201d\n\nEarlier in 2019, the Lightning Torch transaction relay has significantly increased the profile of both the technology and Bitcoin itself, with participants including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.", "description": "Well-known BTC proponent Samson Mow believes that off-chain scaling will take the pressure off Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in the coming years", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOGMxNzc5ODdmZjY1NzZjNGNjMjdjYTlmZDVlN2JlMzAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
