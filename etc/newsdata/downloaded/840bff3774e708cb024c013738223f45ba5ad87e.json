The disruption of the speech, which leader Carrie Lam was forced to deliver via video amid a heavy police presence aimed at deterring more protests, underscored how little room officials have to maneuver as pressure mounts for a resolution to the crisis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChina promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy until 2047 \u2014 a half-century after its handover from British rule, under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle \u2014 but Beijing has been tightening its grip. Activists say the ruling Communist Party has gradually chipped away at the rights enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong that do not exist in mainland China, such as an independent judiciary and freedom of assembly.\n\nAfter months of clashes between pro-democracy protesters and riot police in Hong Kong sparked by now-shelved plans to allow extraditions to the mainland, the city\u2019s government invoked emergency powers this month to ban masks at protests. The intensifying crackdown prompted U.S. lawmakers to propose the bill, which must get a green light from the Senate and White House before it becomes law.\n\n\u201cThe extraordinary outpouring of courage from the people of Hong Kong stands in stark contrast to a cowardly government that refuses to respect the rule of law or live up to the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 framework, which was guaranteed more than two decades ago,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D.-Calif.) said Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang voiced Beijing\u2019s \u201cstrong indignation and firm opposition\u201d to the bill and said China would take strong measures to safeguard its interests.\n\nHe said the bill demonstrated a \u201cnaked double standard, which fully exposes the extreme hypocrisy of some people in the U.S. on the issues of human rights and democracy and their sinister intentions to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability and contain China\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nYang Guang, spokesman for China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, which oversees Hong Kong affairs, said the bill \u201copenly supports the opposition and radical forces in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt fully exposes the political plot of the U.S. House of Representatives and some politicians to use Hong Kong as a card to contain and restrain China\u2019s development,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Hong Kong, which is tipping toward recession, the bill could portend severe economic consequences. An end to the special trading relationship with the United States would erode the city\u2019s advantages as a Western-friendly business hub and a regional base for multinational firms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe United States is Hong Kong\u2019s second-largest trading partner, with estimated two-way trade of $69 billion in 2017. It is also the second-largest destination for Hong Kong exports, which amounted to $42 billion.\n\nOther measures passed in the House on Tuesday would prohibit U.S. exports of military and crowd-control gear used by Hong Kong police.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government issued a lengthy statement detailing the ways it abides by the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework.\n\n\u201cSafeguarding human rights and freedoms is a constitutional duty of the [Hong Kong] government,\u201d the statement said, adding that police have acted with \u201crestraint\u201d and \u201cin strict accordance with the law.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA government spokesman added that \u201cforeign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs\u201d of Hong Kong.\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, riot police sealed off the city\u2019s legislative chambers as Lam, the Hong Kong leader, arrived to deliver her annual policy address.\n\nMinutes into her appearance, pro-democracy lawmakers heckled Lam and forced her to suspend the speech. Some held signs saying \u201cFive Demands, Not One Less,\u201d a reference to protesters\u2019 demands, with an image of a smiling Lam featuring bloodied hands.\n\nLam \u201chas killed Hong Kong, there is blood on her hands. She has made millions of protesters take to our streets,\u201d said Tanya Chan, a pro-democracy lawmaker. \u201cHong Kong cannot go back to what it was anymore.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn her video address, Lam announced measures to address housing supply and affordability in the city, the world\u2019s most expensive property market. The housing situation is often cited as a source of public discontent, especially among young people who say they are often locked out of an economic system that favors tycoons and the pro-Beijing elite.\n\nAD\n\nLam said the unrest in Hong Kong was a hindrance to economic growth and to the government\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cEmployees of all trades and sectors, as well as small, medium and large businesses alike are deeply worried about the prospect of Hong Kong,\u201d Lam said. \u201cPeople are asking: will Hong Kong return to normal? Is Hong Kong still a place we can live in peace?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnna Fifield in Beijing and Tiffany Liang in Hong Kong contributed to this article.\n\nAD", "description": "As authorities crack down on protesters in the financial hub, Beijing says it rejects any foreign interference and accuses U.S. lawmakers of harboring sinister intentions.", "authors": ["David Crawshaw", "Asian Politics", "Geopolitics", "Especially North", "South Korea", "Southeast Asia", "Australia", "Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EEv-Nda5zqmLM4I2GRKsOpEI7zE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CRTQ7EXPYYI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
