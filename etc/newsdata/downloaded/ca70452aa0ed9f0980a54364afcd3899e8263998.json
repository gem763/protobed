Token Circulation (# of unique ETH being used each day) continues to decline over the past 5 months\u2026 2. Ethereum\u2019s maximal mean age (avg. age that each coin has remained in its current address) continues to rise\u2026 3. # of active coins over a period of 90 days has begun to decline as of recently,\u201d they explained in the thread seen below.\n\n3. # of active coins over a period of 90 days has begun to decline as of recently: Source: https://t.co/rGvvCISdBM pic.twitter.com/YINCPRAAHC \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 18, 2019\n\nWill ETH Extend Its Upwards Momentum?\n\nBecause Bitcoin is currently trading sideways in the lower-$10,000 region, it is highly likely that any upwards BTC movement could further perpetuate ETH\u2019s momentum and send it surging even higher.\n\nBig Cheds, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, spoke about Ethereum in a recent tweet, explaining that its latest upwards movement marks a notable breakout over its upper Bollinger Band, which may mean that further gains are imminent.\n\n\u201c$ETH #Ethereum \u2013 4 hour \u2013 Big breakout,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe coming hours may prove to be quite illuminating for ETH\u2019s near-term price action, as Bitcoin\u2019s price action may ultimately bolster ETH\u2019s current surge and could allow it to post significantly higher gains.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Analysts are noting that multiple metrics signal that Ethereum is currently undergoing an accumulation period, which may justify further gains for ETH.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_1030451626-5-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
