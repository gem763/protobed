The Times later published a major update to include those details, along with an editors' note, but not before virtually all major Democratic presidential candidates had called for Kavanaugh's impeachment.\n\nSpecifically, Keyser challenged Ford's narrative that sometime in the summer of 1982, Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge assaulted her at a party also attended by Keyser and P.J. Smith.\n\n\"I don\u2019t have any confidence in the story,\u201d Keyser told the reporters of Ford's claims, according to outlets that have reviewed advance copies of the forthcoming book.\n\n\"Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense,\" Keyser added.\n\n\"Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense.\" \u2014 Leland Keyser\n\nFord has been unable to identify exactly where or when the alleged assault occurred, or how she got home after the incident.\n\nKeyser reportedly remarked: \"It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she's getting home.\" Keyser told Pogrebin and Kelly, \"I just really didn't have confidence in the story.\"\n\nLast year, Keyser, speaking through her attorney, said she could not corroborate Ford's claims. Keyser told the FBI she felt pressured by partisan activists and Ford's friends to change her account and later revised her statement to indicate that she believed Ford despite her lack of memory of the episode.\n\nKeyser's initial statement was that \"Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.\u201d\n\nThe revised statement from Keyser's attorney read: \"Ms. Keyser does not refute Dr. Ford's account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford's account. However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question.\u201d\n\n2020 DEMS CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR KAVANAUGH IMPEACHMENT, DESPITE DUD NYT 'BOMBSHELL' GOING BUST\n\nThe Times' authors, in the book, cast doubt on Keyser's memory, writing that \u201cKeyser\u2019s memory might be affected by her struggles with alcohol and other substances.\u201d Keyser, though, also informed the reporters of an apparent smear campaign directed at her, in an effort to get her to change her story.\n\nFord, in her explosive testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, indicated that it wasn't surprising Keyser wouldn't remember the episode.\n\n\"She didn\u2019t know about the event. She was downstairs during the event and I did not share it with her,\u201d Ford said.\n\nFord added: \u201cLeland has significant health challenges, and I\u2019m happy that she\u2019s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs, and she let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her, and she texted me right afterward with an apology and good wishes, and et cetera.\u201d\n\nRather than mention Keyser's latest remarks, the Times' article instead focused on a new accuser mentioned in the book, who was allegedly sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh. But the Times' article omitted key details from the book, including that the accuser herself had no recollection of the event.\n\nThe Times later published an editors' note adding the information, but not before virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates demanded Kavanaugh's' impeachment.\n\nThroughout the day on Sunday, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Julian Castro, among others, declared that Kavanaugh must be removed from office, citing the allegation.\n\nThe Times' update also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.\n\nThe only firsthand account concerning the supposed attack in the original piece, which was published on Saturday, came from a Clinton-connected lawyer who claimed to have witnessed it. The lawyer, Max Stier, did not actually provide his account directly; the Times acknowledged that \"two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier\" had relayed his supposed version of events.\n\nThe Times did not mention Stier's work as a Clinton defense attorney, or Stier's legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation, and simply called him a \"respected thought leader.\"\n\nThe Times went on to note in the article that it had \"corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier,\" but the article apparently meant only that the Times had corroborated that Stier made his claim to the FBI. No firsthand corroboration of the alleged episode was apparently obtained.\n\nThe Times' revision stated: \"Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\"\n\nThe Times' update came only after The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who reviewed an advance copy of the book, first flagged the article's omission on Twitter \u2014 prompting other commentators to press the issue.\n\nThe Times did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News seeking comment. But commentators made clear they felt the paper's note wasn't sufficient.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Should I be surprised at this point that the NYT would make such an unforgivable oversight?\" asked RealClearInvestigations' Mark Hemingway.\n\nWrote the Washington Examiner's Jerry Dunleavy: \"Crazy how the 'one element' that wasn\u2019t included in the original article was the part where the alleged victim\u2019s friends said she doesn\u2019t remember it happening.\"\n\nFor his part, President Trump unloaded on the Times, and suggested Kavanaugh should sue.\n\n\"The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News!\" Trump wrote. \"This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems.\"\n\nHe added: \"DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued!\"\n\nSeparately, the Times' article states that seven new witnesses could corroborate Deborah Ramirez's account that Kavanaugh allegedly exposed himself at a party. Only one of those second-hand witnesses claims to have heard about Kavanaugh's possible involvement at the time, according to the book, and Ramirez herself previously acknowledged she was not sure Kavanaugh was the culprit. Senate investigators and the FBI were unable to corroborate Ramirez's claims, and Ramirez did not cooperate with the GOP probe.", "description": "Leland Keyser, a\u00a0friend of Christine Blasey Ford who allegedly was at the party where Ford says Brett\u00a0Kavanaugh assaulted her decades ago, now says the story \"just didn't make any sense.\"", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Leland Keyser", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
