A legal request to force him to seek an extension was declined Monday by Scotland\u2019s Court of Session.\n\nThe Irish backstop would keep Northern Ireland, part of Britain, in the EU single market and customs trade as an insurance mechanism to prevent a hard border between it and Ireland. Johnson\u2019s proposal called for customs stations on both sides of the border to screen goods between Britain\u2019s Northern Ireland and the EU\u2019s Ireland \u2014 mostly electronically to prevent physical border checks. EU and Irish officials have effectively rejected that proposal.\n\nJohnson told Merkel on the call Tuesday his administration\u2019s offer was \u201creasonable\u201d but blamed the EU for not having \u201cany desire for negotiation.\u201d He added that some in the EU are rooting for a second Brexit referendum, but said that won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIt was a very useful clarifying moment in all sorts of ways,\u201d the government source said. \u201cIf this represents a new established position then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now, but ever.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commission President Donald Tusk criticized Johnson\u2019s position Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game, he tweeted. \u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the U.K. as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u201d", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 A deal for Britain to leave the European Union might be less likely after German Chancellor Angela Merkel told British Prime Minister", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
