The impeachment inquiry, explained", "language": "en", "text": "Congress is considering impeaching the president. What is he accused of, what does he say, who else is involved and what\u2019s next?\n\nThe House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, announced on 24 September an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. The proceedings have developed with a swiftness and complexity that might leave some readers feeling dazed.\n\nHere\u2019s a thumbnail guide.\n\nWhat is Trump accused of?\n\nIn a July 2019 phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to mount an investigation of his potential rival for the White House in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, and son Hunter Biden \u2013 and also to investigate a Fox News-space conspiracy theory that Ukraine, instead of Russia, was behind foreign tampering in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump framed the requests as a \u201cfavor\u201d after he reminded his counterpart that \u201cthe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine\u201d. Overshadowing the conversation was the fact that Trump had recently suspended hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine to defend itself against Russia .\n\nNews of the call emerged in a Washington Post report on 18 September that an internal whistleblower complaint, filed in August, involved \u201ccommunications between Trump and a foreign leader\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s attempted dealings in Ukraine caused a scandal in US diplomatic ranks. The Democrats have obtained text messages between top US envoys in Ukraine establishing that diplomats told Zelenskiy that a White House visit to meet Trump was dependent on him making a public statement vowing to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s company. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d one message said.\n\nWhat\u2019s Trump\u2019s version of events?\n\nTrump does not dispute public accounts of what he said in the call, as established by the intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint, released on 26 September, and a call summary released by the White House itself the day before.\n\nBut Trump and allies have argued that the conversation \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve given you that, now I need this\u201d \u2013 was not actually as transactional as it appears to be. That\u2019s beside the point legally, analysts say, but you be the judge.\n\nMeanwhile Trump and Republicans have, without denying their conduct, sought to undermine his accusers and frame the proceedings as, surprise, a partisan \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.\n\nThis sounds depressingly familiar, bye\n\nNo hard feelings, bye! But really, that appears to be part of Trump\u2019s strategy here \u2013 to sow division and doubt to create the impression that this impeachment inquiry amounts to just one more crazy whirl around Washington\u2019s wacky partisan merry-go-round. It\u2019s a ride many Americans are truly sick of.\n\nIs this just one more whirl around Washington\u2019s partisan merry-go-round?\n\nThe thing is, so long as Republicans in Congress don\u2019t contradict Trump, he has a lot of power to make it seem so. But just because Trump is out there red-faced and ranting, bullying and crying BULLSHIT \u2013 just because the president is throwing a fit about the allegation that he violated his oath of office or commited a crime does not mean he did not violate his oath or commit a crime.\n\nDid Trump violate his oath or commit a crime?\n\nA lot of people \u2013 from the whistleblower, to career government officials swept up in the affair, to legal scholars, to Democrats and Republicans who have not drunk the Trump \u201cKool-Aid\u201d \u2013 believe it\u2019s plausible that the president has committed an impeachable offense.\n\nQ&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam\n\nWhat about the other foreign countries and people involved?\n\nIn at least five countries, Trump or Trump administration officials have been active on two fronts: urging attacks on Biden and rewriting the story of the 2016 US election.\n\nTrump has conscripted the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who listened in on the July Ukraine call and the attorney general, William Barr, who has met with government contacts in Italy and London and sought Australian contacts to review special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. That investigation had prompted much impeachment talk but the Ukraine scandal quickly sparked a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nMeanwhile Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has pressured Ukraine to smear Biden, and the whistleblower said White House officials had caused records of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call to be moved into a specially restricted computer system. And the vice-president, Mike Pence, has acknowledged contacts with Ukrainian officials while claiming to have no knowledge of Trump\u2019s Biden agenda.\n\nOn 3 October, Trump even suggested that: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d That\u2019s an abuse of power in plain sight, critics say.\n\nTrump, foreign election tampering \u2013 is this just a replay of Mueller?\n\nNo. Unlike when he was a candidate, Trump\u2019s invitations for foreign powers to attack his domestic political opponents now have all the power of the White House behind them.\n\nCritics say this is a plain abuse of that power and stinks of despotism.And it undermines US national security because it places Trump\u2019s personal agenda first. In America, l\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est pas moi.\n\nTrump is also accused of undermining the integrity of US elections, violating the civil rights of the US citizens he is calling out for foreign attack, and violating campaign finance laws by soliciting foreign help. The Trump administration also stands accused of obstruction of justice for resisting congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony relating to the crisis.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThe inquiry continues in the Democratic-dominated House of Representatives until \u2013 and Pelosi wants this ASAP \u2013 they are ready to vote. If a simple majority votes to impeach Trump he faces trial in the Republican-dominated US Senate.\n\nGetting medieval: impeachment's roots go back to 14th-century England Read more\n\ntl;dr: can you give that to me in tweet length?", "description": "Congress is considering impeaching the president.
