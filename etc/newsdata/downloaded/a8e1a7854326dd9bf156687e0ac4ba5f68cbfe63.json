I did nothing wrong'", "language": "en", "text": "Former Vice President Joe Biden insisted during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday night that neither he nor his son Hunter did anything \"wrong\" when it comes to the younger Biden's past work in Ukraine.\n\nBiden was asked why his son was able to hold a lucrative role serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, while he was running U.S.-Ukraine policy as former President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president.\n\nDEMS UNITE BEHIND IMPEACHING TRUMP AT DEBATE, EVEN AS PELOSI SAYS THERE WON'T BE A VOTE\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI carried out the policy of the United States government, which was to root out corruption in Ukraine and that\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden, earlier Tuesday during an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d likewise defended his role, claiming he did nothing improper, though he did acknowledge it was \"poor judgment\" to have joined the company's board.\n\n\u201cI know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,\u201d the younger Biden said Tuesday morning.\n\nHe also acknowledged in the interview that if he had a different last name, he would not have been appointed to the board of Burisma.\n\nDuring the debate, Biden continued to defend his son, saying that his \u201cstatement speaks for itself,\u201d and that the focus should be on President Trump asking Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 elections.\n\n\u201cRudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven they are flat-out lying,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe Ukraine controversy began when a whistleblower reported that the president had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Biden family\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine\u2014specifically, why Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter was on the board. The president's request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, something critics have cited as evidence of a quid pro quo arrangement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat whistleblower report and the fallout from the transcript of the highly controversial phone call between Trump and Zelensky this summer sparked a formal impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., though, said Tuesday that the House would not vote, at this point in time, to formalize the impeachment proceedings.\n\nBiden maintained Tuesday that Trump\u2019s efforts were simply because of his concerns surrounding his 2020 reelection chances, particularly against Biden. Several polls have shown Biden as Dems' presidential frontrunner throughout the primary season, and some have further suggested he would have an edge against Trump in a general election.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump,\u201d Biden continued, repeating a line he has used frequently on social media. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. He\u2019s going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\u201d", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden insisted\u00a0during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday night\u00a0that neither he nor his son did anything \"wrong\" when it comes to\u00a0Hunter Biden's past work in\u00a0Ukraine.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
