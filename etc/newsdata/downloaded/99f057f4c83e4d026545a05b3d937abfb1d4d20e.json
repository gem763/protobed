Unfortunately the bad news is very bad indeed. The tumour is huge, which makes surgery to remove it \u2018extremely difficult,\u2019 according to Ric. The risks are very high that he could have a stroke or not survive the surgery at all. Leaving the tumour where it is could be an option, but it will probably keep on growing and compress his brain, leading to more mood swings, more forgetfulness and worse. His days as a surgeon would definitely be over very soon.\n\nBecause he had Darla (Naomi Katiyo) to worry about, he decided that he wouldn\u2019t risk the surgery and would try to manage the symptoms of the tumour with drugs. He also decided not to worry Darla by telling her about his diagnosis.\n\nMeet the parents (Picture: BBC)\n\nEverything changed when Darla was visited by Peter (Jordan Adene), the father of her baby, who proved to be a very mature, supportive and sensible 15 year old. Donna (Jaye Jacobs) had already detected in Darla signs of doubt that she wanted to go through with having her baby adopted and Peter\u2019s arrival cemented her decision \u2013 she wanted to keep her daughter. Peter said he\u2019d get a job and they\u2019d manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRic was on board with this plan because he\u2019s always wanted whatever makes Darla happy. Then Peter\u2019s father (Daniel Adegboyega), an elder of the church, arrived and kicked off a bit. He accused Darla of trying to trap his son and said the baby might not even be Peter\u2019s. There was a bit of a tussle as he tried to take Peter away and Ric ended up being thrown to the ground and knocked unconscious.\n\nEveryone\u2019s worried about Ric (Picture: BBC)\n\nRic wasn\u2019t seriously hurt, but as everyone clustered around his bedside Cameron (Nic Jackman) said something about his \u2018serious condition\u2019 in front of Darla, so Ric had no option but to tell her the truth. Peter proved that he\u2019s a keeper by smoothing things out with Darla\u2019s dad, so Darla is going to move back in with Kofi and bring up the baby, after making Ric promise that he has to do what\u2019s best for him and not delay the surgery just for her sake. And they\u2019re naming the baby Erica, after her great-granddad \u2013 which made him fill up. \u2018She wouldn\u2019t be here now if it weren\u2019t for you,\u2019 Darla said. \u2018And Cameron,\u2019 he reminded her, \u2018But Erica\u2019s a better name.\u2019\n\nRic apologised to Zav (Marcus Griffiths) and Donna for his recent behaviour and told them he\u2019s going to go for the surgery, because he wants to carry on being a surgeon himself if there\u2019s even a slim chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile a small bunch of supporting artists had assembled to give Essie (Kaye Wragg) a party to welcome her new adopted baby. This was mainly a plot device so one of the cards would be found later on by Connor (Calum Lill) \u2013 Isla\u2019s father. He\u2019d come to the hospital to get Frankie\u2019s phone number from Essie but he soon worked out that Essie is pretending that Isla is her legally adopted daughter. Sacha (Bob Barrett) tried to help Essie out by warning Connor off but only succeeded in making the situation worse. Essie finally resorted to good old fashioned bribery and gave Connor as much money as the Pulses\u2019 cash machine would dish out to please go away and not bother her. I don\u2019t expect that\u2019s the last we\u2019ll hear from him, though.\n\nDarwin patient o\u2019 the week Bea (Rosalind Halstead) turned out to be Kian (Ramin Karimloo)\u2019s long-lost love. She also needed a heart valve replacement or repair and he gave her the choice of which to go for. She plumped for the repair \u2013 less invasive, less recovery time \u2013 but in theatre Nicky (Belinda Owusu) said she\u2019d have strongly advised the replacement. Was Kian\u2019s clinical judgement clouded by a haze of romantic memories?\n\nSue Haasler is the author of the official Holby City book, which you can read about here.
