Come over here you\u2019ll be caught by the neck, that chicken neck. You don\u2019t fool me,\u201d Gracie told the camera.\n\nGracie, 52, was appointed to the position last month by Brazil\u2019s controversial far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro. His job promoting the country\u2019s tourism has been especially hamstrung in recent weeks, as the news of the fires hit the headlines globally.\n\nAMAZON FIRES TURN POLITICAL AS BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT CALLS OUT FRANCE'S MACRON\n\nHowever, the ambassador referred to them as \u201cfalse fires\u201d in an ensuing interview with Brazilian news outlet UOL.\n\n\u201cThat gang of clowns only open their mouths to speak badly about our country,\u201d Gracie lamented, referring to Macron. \"Of course many will be astonished, they will think I called him a female chicken because his manhood is questionable, but no. I've met many gays more manly than this imbecile.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to ridicule Macron\u2019s wife, Brigitte, as a \u201cdragon.\u201d\n\n\"I'll ask you a question, is his wife pretty or ugly? Would you do her? If you criticize our country, get ready to listen to a load of bulls***, and also about your relatives,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cThe fact that he is sleeping with the dragon does not make him a fire expert. She\u2019s ugly, my brother.\u201d\n\nGracie\u2019s inflammatory remarks come amid escalating bickering between the French and Brazilian governments following Macron\u2019s condemnation of Brazil\u2019s handling of the wildfires ravaging the Amazon rainforest.\n\nLast month, the French leader called the blazes an \"international crisis\" and insisted it should be on the agenda at the then-forthcoming G7 summit. An angered Bolsonaro responded that the notion of prioritizing the matter was \"reminiscent of [a] colonial mindset [that was] inappropriate in the 21st century,\u201d and later accused Macron of triggering \"unreasonable and gratuitous attacks on the Amazon.\"\n\nBRAZILIANS CONDEMN BOLSONARO OVER BRIGITTE MACRON REMARKS: 'SORRY ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT'\n\nBolsonaro exacerbated the situation when he appeared to mock Mrs Macron. A user posted a derogatory meme on the South American leader\u2019s Facebook page last week, comparing the appearances of the Brazilian and French First Ladies and suggesting that Macron was envious.\n\n\"Don't humiliate the guy ... haha,\" read the response, accompanied by a \u201clike\u201d from Bolsonaro's account.\n\nNonetheless, critics and environmental activists continue to express alarm over the devastating fires. Brazil\u2019s National Space Research Institute documented almost 4000 flare-ups in just two days. More significantly, it was the two days immediately after the government announced a 60-day ban on controlled burning, The Independent reported.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOver 72,000 fires were recorded across the Latin American country in the first eight months of the year. The unprecedented figure ignited mass panic given that the forest \u2013 termed \u201cthe lungs of the world\u201d \u2013 is considered a critical carbon store that contributes an estimated 20 percent of the planet\u2019s oxygen.", "description": "Brazil\u2019s tourism ambassador and former Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter, Renzo Gracie, has posted a video on Twitter threatening to \u201cchoke\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron - along with insulting his wife.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
