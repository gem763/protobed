Though he is still performing at a high level now, his effectiveness at the top will abate with age.\n\nBut Bar\u00e7a seemingly has a succession plan already as the Spanish champion is reportedly considering signing Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane, or Marcus Rashford.\n\nKane and Rashford are worth $160 million according to their CIES market valuations, while Mbappe could cost as much as $275 million.\n\nTwo of those players would prove costly errors for Bar\u00e7a\n\nTottenham Hotspur striker Kane, 26, is further along in his career than Rashford, with 130 Premier League goals. But Manchester United's 21-year-old forward has already established himself as one of the planet's brightest young talents since he burst onto the scene at Old Trafford in 2016.\n\nTalent aside, each presents their own problems which would see them fail at Barcelona, should the La Liga heavyweight prise them from England.\n\nRead more:Nobody wants to buy the world's top soccer players because they're overpaid and too old and could be a gigantic waste of money\n\nKane is simply not a good fit for Ernesto Valverde's side.\n\nIn Suarez, Barcelona has a striker who is happy to play anywhere across the front three, acting as a provider and a goalscorer. Since joining the club in 2014, Suarez has scored 157 goals in the Spanish league and Europe combined while also tallying 75 assists.\n\nKane's goalscoring record is similar to Suarez's across that same period but his assist record is far inferior, managing only 23 \u2014 fewer than a third of Suarez's total.\n\nAt Tottenham, Kane is given license to shoot on sight. At Barcelona, that same freedom would not apply. He'd be expected to drop deep, collect the ball, take on players, and feed teammates just as he would be expected to drift wide in a fluid attacking line, just as Suarez does at the Camp Nou presently, and others have before him.\n\nAs good as Kane is, that just isn't his game. His game is built on staying central, and either holding it up or hitting the target at the earliest opportunity.\n\nRashford has more promise but still poses problems.\n\nRashford is as almost as prolific at supplying the final ball as he is finishing the move himself, with 39 career goals and 23 assists in Premier League and UEFA competitions.\n\nRashford was excellent as a teenager, thriving as Manchester United's sole striker, a responsibility bestowed upon him at the time by the former manager Louis Van Gaal.\n\nBut after the arrival of Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Old Trafford, Rashford's form dipped when he was pushed to a wider role.\n\nKane and Rashford play together for England, but neither would be suitable for Barcelona. Getty/Michael Regan\n\nWhen Ole Gunnar Solsjaer became manager around Christmas, 2018, shunning striker Romelu Lukaku in favor of Rashford, the young Englishman returned eight goals in a 13 game period. When Lukaku returned to the team in March and Rashford was moved back out wide, he managed just three for the rest of the season.\n\nIt is clear where Rashford plays his most effective soccer, but to play effectively at Barcelona he must play wherever Messi doesn't want to play \u2014 that could be out wide, or up front.\n\nAny player who moves to the Camp Nou is expected to accommodate the world's best player. Suarez had to do it, and talented attackers before like David Villa and Thierry Henry had to do it before him.\n\nEven Ibrahimovic had to do it, much to his own distaste.\n\n\"[Messi] went to [club manager Pep] Guardiola and said, 'I don't want to be on the right wing any more, I want to play in the center,'\" the Swede said in his 2014 autobiography \"I Am Zlatan.\"\n\nHe added: \"I was the striker. Guardiola didn't give a damn about that, though. He changed the tactical formation. Guardiola had to listen to him.\"\n\nRashford will be no exception. Part of Suarez, Villa, and Henry's success at the club was because of their willingness to play secondary to Messi.\n\nIt's for the opposite reason why Ibrahimovic, and Alexis Sanchez struggled in Spain, and were ultimately offloaded.\n\nDespite Rashford's talent, his inflexibility would see him suffer the same fate as Sanchez.\n\nBar\u00e7a needs someone who can play multiple positions when needed, in a a fluid front three. That someone just isn't Rashford.\n\n$275 million Mbappe is the one Barcelona should sign\n\nBarcelona wants a proven goalscorer who is equally capable of providing for its teammates, and happy to vacate a central role for a position further wide. That proven player is Mbappe.\n\n\"He's a phenomenon. He's clearly going to be the best player in the world in the future,\" former Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas said of Mbappe in September, according to Goal.\n\n\"If I had him in front of me I'd be giving him assists all the time because he's so fast, explosive, but he's also very clever in slipping his markers.\"\n\nKylian Mbappe.

It's not just the number of goals they score. It's the beguiling, beautiful, almost telepathic brilliance of their interplay.\"\n\nThe one constant in all of Barcelona's front threes over the years has been \"M\" \u2014 Messi.\n\nThe Argentine is showing no signs of slowing down, however at 32 years old, he is approaching the twilight of his career.\n\nMbappe may be eyed as a replacement for Suarez in the short term, but in the long run, it could be Messi he ends up replacing, in turn becoming the Spanish club's new \"M\", and the focal point of their attacking trio in the years that follow.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe man who discovered 12-year-old Lionel Messi made him sign a contract on a paper napkin because he 'couldn't let him get away'\n\nCristiano Ronaldo reportedly makes more money being an influencer on Instagram than he does playing soccer for Juventus\n\nIt seems there are only a few players at Manchester United who actually like one another after a failed dinner party where only 5 people showed up", "description": "FC Barcelona transfer news: Club is linked with three players but only Kylian Mbappe would be the perfect replacement for veteran striker Luis Suarez.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5b0294af9090a246619e3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
