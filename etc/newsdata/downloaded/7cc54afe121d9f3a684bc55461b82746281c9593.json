Harry also revealed the pair would be taking legal action.\n\nAccording to a legal spokesperson representing Markle, the Duchess of Sussex filed a claim on Sunday against the Mail -- and its parent company Associated Newspapers -- alleging \"the intrusive and unlawful publication of a private letter written by\" Markle. Although the suit does not name the specific letter, The Guardian reports that the Mail published a letter penned by Markle to her estranged father.\n\nPRINCE HARRY WILL OPEN A HOSPITAL IN AFRICA NAMED AFTER LATE MOM PRINCESS DIANA\n\n\"There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face \u2013 as so many of you can relate to \u2013 I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,\" Harry wrote. \"Because in today\u2019s digital age, press fabrications are repurposed as truth across the globe. One day\u2019s coverage is no longer tomorrow\u2019s chip-paper.\n\n\"Up to now, we have been unable to correct the continual misrepresentations \u2014 something that these select media outlets have been aware of and have therefore exploited on a daily and sometimes hourly basis,\" he continued, noting that this is why the Sussexes have decided to take legal action \u2014 \"a process,\" according to Harry, \"that has been many months in the making.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old royal's statement comes as the family's official 10-day tour of Africa draws to a close.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY PAY TRIBUTE TO LATE PRINCESS DIANA ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\n\"The positive coverage of the past week from these same publications exposes the double standards of this specific press pack that has vilified her almost daily for the past nine months; they have been able to create lie after lie at her expense simply because she has not been visible while on maternity leave,\" Harry stated. \"She is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you\u2019ve seen on this Africa tour.\"\n\nHarry went on to explain that for the \"select media\" he is referencing, \"this is a game\" \u2014 and it's one that the Sussexes \"have been unwilling to play from the start.\"\n\n\"I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long,\" Harry said of Markle, 38. \"To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE REVEALS HER NICKNAME FOR SON ARCHIE\n\nHarry added that \"though this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one.\"\n\n\"Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself,\" he continued. \"I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\n\nIn a 2017 documentary, Harry slammed the paparazzi for causing his mother Princess Diana's deadly crash in Paris 22 years ago.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"We thank you, the public, for your continued support,\" Harry concluded. \"It is hugely appreciated.
