Arsenal FC via Getty Images 2/21 20. Newcastle United IN: Joelinton (Hoffenheim) \u00a340m, Jetro Willems (Frankfurt) loan, Allan Saint-Maximin (Nice) undisclosed, Andy Carroll (West Ham) free, Emil Krafth (Amiens) undisclosed\n\n\n\nForget the numerous arrivals \u2013 Newcastle are a team still reeling from the departure of Rafael Ben\u00edtez in June as well as their two top goal scorers last season: Solom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and Ayoze P\u00e9rez. Joelinton\u2019s \u00a340m arrival from Hoffenheim is fascinating but the 22-year-old is hardly prolific, having scored just 22 goals in 83 league appearances. Andy Carroll is a good addition \u2013 but how many matches can Newcastle expect him to play? In short: a disastrous summer means it\u2019s likely to be a very, very difficult season for new manager Steve Bruce. Newcastle United via Getty Image 3/21 19. Burnley IN: Bailey Peacock-Farrell \u2013 Leeds United, \u00a32.5m, Jay Rodriguez (West Bromwich Albion) Free, Erik Pieters (Stoke) undisclosed, Joel Senior \u2013 Curzon Ashton, undisclosed, Danny Drinkwater (Chelsea) loan\n\n\n\nSean Dyche likes a tight-knit side: but have they done enough this window? Jay Rodriguez should add a handful of goals after the retirement of Peter Crouch. Danny Drinkwater is a solid addition on loan. And they have managed to retain James Tarkowski despite widespread interest in the defender. But they have a thin squad and should they get unlucky with injuries it could be a long season. PA 4/21 18. Crystal Palace IN: Jordan Ayew (Swansea) \u00a32.5m, Stephen Henderson (Nottingham Forest) free, Gary Cahill (Chelsea) free, Victor Camarasa (Real Betis) loan, James McCarthy (Everton) \u00a33m\n\n\n\nThe good news is Palace have been able to hang on to club talisman Wilfried Zaha \u2013 just. The bad news is that he is clearly unsettled, they haven\u2019t been able to replace Aaron Wan-Bissaka at right-back and they haven\u2019t signed a new striker to replace the departing Michy Batshuayi. James McCarthy is a good signing, but who knows how long he will be able to remain fit for. Ditto Gary Cahill. It\u2019s not looking particularly good for Palace. Getty Images 5/21 17. Chelsea IN: Mateo Kovacic (Real Madrid) \u00a340m\n\n\n\nWhat a job Frank Lampard has on his hands this season. Chelsea\u2019s inability to make any new signings until next summer means that the new manager is going to have to rely heavily on his young players this summer. The club were able to make Mateo Kovacic\u2019s loan permanent, while Christian Pulisic returns to the club from Dortmund having signed last winter, but they are a weaker side than last season. Principally because of Eden Hazard, but David Luiz will also be missed. Chelsea FC via Getty Images 6/21 16. Bournemouth IN: Harry Wilson (Liverpool) loan, Arnaut Danjuma (Club Bruges) \u00a313.7m, \u200fPhilip Billing (Huddersfield,) \u00a315m, Jack Stacey (Luton Town) \u00a34m, Lloyd Kelly (Bristol City) undisclosed\n\n\n\nA typical Bournemouth summer in many respects. They have successfully held onto their key players \u2013 particularly Callum Wilson and Joshua King \u2013 while recruiting shrewdly from the Football League. Philip Billing is a particularly smart signing while 22-year-old livewire Arnaut Danjuma is a more eye-catching arrival. They should be okay. AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images 7/21 15. Liverpool IN: Sepp van den Berg (PEC Zwolle) \u00a31.3m, Harvey Elliott (Fulham) undisclosed, Adrian (West Ham) free\n\n\n\nAn extremely difficult window to judge. Liverpool spent big last summer and clearly felt they could not reasonably expect to improve their squad given their financial constraints this season. The European champions are a settled unit and look like the only team with a realistic chance of ending Manchester City\u2019s domestic dominance, but may come to regret strengthening if they are hit by injuries in key positions \u2013 particularly at the back. Getty Images 8/21 14. Southampton IN: Moussa Djenepo (Standard Liege) \u00a314million, Che Adams (Birmingham City) undisclosed, Danny Ings (Liverpool) \u00a320m\n\n\n\nRalph Hasenh\u00fcttl worked wonders with this team last season and the additions of Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo \u2013 plus the permanent signing of Danny Ings \u2013 gives him plenty of options in attack. But it\u2019s a lopsided squad and they remain vulnerable at the back. Getty 9/21 13. Norwich City Ibrahim Amadou (Sevilla), loan, Sam Byram (West Ham) undisclosed, Josip Drmic (Borussia Monchengladbach) free, Patrick Roberts (Manchester City) loan, Daniel Adshead (Rochdale) undisclosed, Archie Mair (Aberdeen) undisclosed, Rob Nizet (Anderlecht) undisclosed, Ralf Fahrmann (FC Schalke 04) loan, Aidan Fitzpatrick (Partick Thistle) \u00a3350,000\n\n\n\nYou know you\u2019ve had a frugal window when your most glamorous arrival is Sam Byram pitching up from West Ham United. Norwich are unable to spend the money Aston Villa have been throwing around and so have recruited frugally. Josip Drmic could prove a valuable signing although there are question marks over his fitness. PA 10/21 12. Sheffield United IN: Oli McBurnie (Swansea) \u00a317.5m, Lys Mousset (Bournemouth) \u00a310m, Phil Jagielka (Everton) free, Luke Freeman (QPR) undisclosed, Callum Robinson (Preston) undisclosed, Ravel Morrison free\n\n\n\nSheffield United have broken their transfer record four times since winning promotion last season. So much rests on how their most expensive signing \u2013 the 23-year-old forward Oli McBurnie \u2013 adjusts to the Premier League. Should he adapt quickly, Chris Wilder\u2019s unusually attacking style of play could rattle a few feathers in the top-flight. But if the goals aren\u2019t forthcoming, it will be a gruelling campaign for the play-off winners, whose squad lacks Premier League experience. Getty 11/21 11. Brighton & Hove Albion IN: Adam Webster (Bristol City) \u00a320m, Leandro Trossard (Genk) undisclosed, Matt Clarke (Portsmouth) undisclosed, Neal Maupay (Brentford) undisclosed, Romaric Yapi (Paris St-Germain) undisclosed, Aaron Mooy (Huddersfield) loan\n\n\n\nNew manager Graham Potter has presided over a fairly comprehensive summer refresh after last season\u2019s worrying capitulation \u2013 although, crucially, Lewis Dunk has remained at the club. He will be partnered in defence by \u00a320m arrival Adam Webster, one of the best players in the Championship last season, with Aaron Mooy arriving on loan. Action Images via Reuters 12/21 10. Manchester United IN: Daniel James (Swansea) \u00a315million, Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace) \u00a350m, Harry Maguire (Leicester) \u00a380m\n\n\n\nIt was a transfer window that promised so much more. Harry Maguire is an excellent signing and could well become important to this United team as Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool. But going forward, there are serious question marks, particularly after the departure of Romelu Lukaku. Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bisakka are fine additions but will take time to bed-in. You would think it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to crack the top four with this squad. Getty Images 13/21 9. Wolves IN: Renat Dadashov (Estoril) undisclosed, Patrick Cutrone (AC Milan) \u00a316m, Raul Jimenez (Benfica) undisclosed, Hong (Yeovil Town) undisclosed, Raphael Nya (PSG) undisclosed, Leander Dendoncker (Anderlecht) undisclosed, Jesus Vallejo (Real Madrid) loan\n\n\n\nWolves needed a striker this summer and they have spent big on Italian prospect Patrick Cutrone, shelling out \u00a316m for the AC Milan man. Crucially, they also retained Raul Jiminez and Leander Dendoncker, who impressed on their loan spells at the club last season. Getty 14/21 8. Watford IN: Ismaila Sarr (Rennes) undisclosed, Danny Welbeck (Arsenal) free, Craig Dawson (West Brom) undisclosed, Tom Dele-Bashiru (Manchester City) compensation\n\n\n\nWatford left their business late into the window, but end the summer significantly stronger than how they started it. Danny Welbeck is a proven Premier League performer and guarantees goals. Meanwhile Ismaila Sarr is one of the most exciting young talents in European football. His performances for Rennes last season had clubs all across Europe interested: regular first-team football at Vicarage Road will help the 21-year-old\u2019s development no end. Getty 15/21 7. Leicester City IN: Youri Tielemans (Monaco) \u00a340m, Ayoze Perez (Newcastle) \u00a330m, James Justin (Luton Town) undisclosed, Dennis Praet (Sampdoria) \u00a318m\n\n\n\nA smart, solid window. Leicester finished strongly under Brendan Rodgers last season and will have been delighted to make Youri Tielemans\u2019 loan move permanent, especially considering rumours Manchester United wanted to lift him off their hands. There are meanwhile high hopes that Ayoze Perez will succeed where Kelechi Iheanacho and Islam Slimani have failed. Harry Magurie is a huge loss and does leave them short in defence, but to sell him for a world-record fee nevertheless represents excellent business. Getty Images 16/21 6. Aston Villa IN: Tom Heaton (Burnley) \u00a38m, Douglas Luiz (Manchester City) \u00a315m, Ezri Konsa (Brentford) \u00a312m, Tyrone Mings (Bournemouth) \u00a320m, Kortney Hause (Wolves) \u00a33m, Wesley (Club Brugge) undisclosed, Anwar El Ghazi (Lille) \u00a37.5m, Jota (Birmingham) undisclosed, Matt Targett (Southampton) undisclosed, Trezeguet (Kasimpasa) \u00a38.75m, Bjorn Engels (Reims) undisclosed, Marvelous Nakamba (Club Brugge) \u00a311m\n\n\n\nIs there anybody in professional football they haven\u2019t attempted to sign this summer? Villa are undoubtedly the Premier League\u2019s big movers, splurging over \u00a3100m since winning promotion from the Championship. The new team could fail to gel much like Fulham last season, but Tyrone Mings and Trezeguet are fine signings, while the likes of Tom Heaton and Matty Targett add some much needed Premier League experience. Aston Villa FC via Getty Images 17/21 5. Manchester City IN: Joao Cancelo (Juventus) \u00a360m, Rodri (Atletico Madrid) \u00a368.2m, Scott Carson (Derby) loan\n\n\n\nDauntingly for the rest of the Premier League, the best team in the country have got even better this summer. Rodri has slotted seamlessly into the team in pre-season and is the natural long-term successor to Fernandinho. The versatile Jo\u00e3o Cancelo will compete with both sets of full-backs. The heart of defence, following the departure of Vincent Kompany, is the only real weak point. But that\u2019s a minor quibble. PA 18/21 4. West Ham IN: Sebastien Haller (Eintracht Frankfurt) \u00a345m, Pablo Fornals (Villarreal) \u00a324m, Roberto (Espanyol) free, David Martin (Millwall) undisclosed, Goncalo Cardosa (Boavista) \u00a33m, Albian Ajeti (Basel) \u00a38m\n\n\n\nWest Ham have once again spent big this summer as Manuel Pellegrini attempts to gate-crash the top six. The club broke their transfer record to sign target man S\u00e9bastien Haller \u2013 who was excellent alongside Luka Jovi\u0107 at Frankfurt last season \u2013 but Pablo Fornals is just as exciting a signing. Should the Spaniard rediscover his 2017/18 form, his attacking partnership with Haller and Felipe Anderson has the potential to be electric. Getty 19/21 3. Tottenham Hotspur IN: Tanguy Ndombele (Lyon) \u00a355m, Giovani Lo Celso (Real Betis) loan, Jack Clarke (Leeds) \u00a310m, Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham) \u00a330m\n\n\n\nAn exceptionally good transfer window that was so nearly perfect. Tottenham\u2019s ultimate failure to finalise a deal for the Juventus striker Paulo Dybala saw the window end with a palpable tinge of disappointment, but it should not go unnoticed that Daniel Levy delivered Mauricio Pochettino his three primary transfer targets. Ryan Sessegnon is a raw talent whose future is surely in safe hands with the Argentine. Tanguy Ndombele is an exciting arrival who should help finally fill the gap left by Moussa Dembele. And Giovani Lo Celso is a dynamic and adaptable midfielder who has all the ability to take English football by storm. There\u2019ll be a lot of pressure on him if Christian Eriksen does indeed leave north London this month, as expected. Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I 20/21 2. Everton IN: Djibril Sidibe (Monaco) loan, Jean-Philippe Gbamin (Mainz) \u00a325m, Moise Kean (Juventus) undisclosed, Fabian Delph (Man City) \u00a310m, Andre Gomes (Barcelona) \u00a322million, Jonas Lossl (Huddersfield) free, Alex Iwobi (Arsenal) \u00a340m\n\n\n\nThere have been some big departures this summer \u2013 particularly Idrissa Gueye and Kurt Zouma \u2013 but a series of big-money arrivals have helped lift spirits at Goodison Park. Mosie Kean is naturally the most eye-catching \u2013 the teenager was deputising for Cristiano Ronaldo just a few months ago \u2013 while Alex Iwobi is an intriguing addition to the squad. But to make Andre Gomes\u2019 loan from Barcelona permanent for \u00a322m \u2013 particularly given the interest of Tottenham earlier in the window \u2013 has to be one of the best signings of the window. Getty 21/21 1. Arsenal IN: Nicolas Pepe (Lille) \u00a372m, Kieran Tierney (Celtic) \u00a325m, William Saliba (Saint-Etienne) \u00a327m [returns to Saint-Etienne on loan for season], Dani Ceballos (Real Madrid) loan, Gabriel Martinelli (Ituano Futebol Clube) Undisclosed\n\n\n\nWho honesty expected a transfer window like this when Josh Kroenke told Arsenal fans to \u2018be excited\u2019 back in mid-July? Club-record signing Nicolas Pepe provides the squad with some much needed incision, while Dani Ceballos looks exactly like the sort of player the much-maligned Denis Su\u00e1rez was supposed to be. Kieran Tierney and David Luiz meanwhile strengthen the defence, undoubtedly the team\u2019s weakness last season.

Everton IN: Djibril Sidibe (Monaco) loan, Jean-Philippe Gbamin (Mainz) \u00a325m, Moise Kean (Juventus) undisclosed, Fabian Delph (Man City) \u00a310m, Andre Gomes (Barcelona) \u00a322million, Jonas Lossl (Huddersfield) free, Alex Iwobi (Arsenal) \u00a340m\n\n\n\nThere have been some big departures this summer \u2013 particularly Idrissa Gueye and Kurt Zouma \u2013 but a series of big-money arrivals have helped lift spirits at Goodison Park. Mosie Kean is naturally the most eye-catching \u2013 the teenager was deputising for Cristiano Ronaldo just a few months ago \u2013 while Alex Iwobi is an intriguing addition to the squad. But to make Andre Gomes\u2019 loan from Barcelona permanent for \u00a322m \u2013 particularly given the interest of Tottenham earlier in the window \u2013 has to be one of the best signings of the window.

Club-record signing Nicolas Pepe provides the squad with some much needed incision, while Dani Ceballos looks exactly like the sort of player the much-maligned Denis Su\u00e1rez was supposed to be. Kieran Tierney and David Luiz meanwhile strengthen the defence, undoubtedly the team\u2019s weakness last season.
