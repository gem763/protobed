Some had their ankles manacled and others were chained by their legs to large metal hubcaps.\n\nPolice said the building housed an Islamic school and that seven people had been arrested in the raid on Thursday. It was not clear how long the children had been held there.\n\n\u201cThe state government is currently providing food to the children,\u201d said Yakubu Sabo, the Kaduna police spokesman. \u201cWe have identified two of the children to have come from Burkina Faso, while most of them were brought by their parents from across mostly northern Nigerian states.\u201d\n\nSabo said those arrested were teachers at the school.\n\nReports in local media said the captives had been tortured, starved and sexually abused. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm those reports, though marks that appeared consistent with injuries inflicted by a whip were visible on one boy\u2019s back.\n\nIslamic schools known as almajiris are common across the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria, the poorest part of the country where most people live on less than $2 a day. Parents often opt to leave their children to board at the schools.\n\nThe children have been moved to a temporary camp at a stadium in Kaduna, and will later be moved to another camp in a suburb of the city while attempts are made to find their parents, police said.\n\nSome parents who had already been contacted went to the school to retrieve their children.\n\n\u201cWe did not know that they would be put to this kind of harsh condition,\u201d one parent told Reuters.\n\nIslamic schools in Nigeria have long been dogged by allegations of abuse and reports that some children were forced to beg on the streets of northern Nigerian cities.\n\nEarlier this year, the government of President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim, said it planned to eventually ban the schools, but would not do so immediately. It followed a number of reports in the Nigerian media that the government planned to outlaw such schools.", "description": "Children rescued from the school were said to have been abused and starved", "authors": ["Reuters In Kaduna"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34329ef658e404867b88bf8ba333e1b672ce6f39/112_0_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad6e71689199a402b2f98488664e545d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
