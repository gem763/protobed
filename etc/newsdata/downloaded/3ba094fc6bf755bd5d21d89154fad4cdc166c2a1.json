By leveraging Google Cloud Platform's particular capabilities, including specific instance sizing and high throughput networking, and Kubernetes, we achieved a state that ticks the technical requirements at the same time as delivering significant cost reductions,\" Max Kelsen CEO and co-founder Nicholas Therkelsen-Terry added.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Leveraging Google Cloud to identify associations between microorganisms and genes to predict different disease states.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/26/09a0c789-7376-49b3-8594-5cebb14df606/thumbnail/770x578/28429c640751724cce2258821070c7c3/microba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
