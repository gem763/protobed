It\u2019s a quintessential insight on the everyday swagger that South Africans have,\" said Game's parent brand and customer director Katherine Madley in a statement on the relaunch.\n\n\"And it\u2019s indicative of the brand and the brand\u2019s personality and nature. It embraces challenge, and fulfils it. It\u2019s almost a challenge to all of us to have Game, because when You\u2019ve Got Game, then Game\u2019s Got You. Keep your chin up, keep your smile on and keep going.\"\n\nGame has used its signature pink colour since it opened its first store in Durban in 1970. It now operates 150 stores across the country.\n\nHere's how Game is introducing its new slogan.\n\n(Compiled by Phillip de Wet)\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The Game store chain is ditching its famous \"You always win at Game\" payoff line for something it says is more in keeping with its identity these days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9453/f55050898ed44357b0cdbfe2f57195aa.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
