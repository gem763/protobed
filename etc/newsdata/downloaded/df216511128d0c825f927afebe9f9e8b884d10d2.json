It has resisted calls for a stimulus package to reverse the slowdown, saying the economy is not facing a crisis.\n\nEconomists say the forecasts do not factor in a possible escalation in the trade conflict between the United States and the EU and are based on the scenario that Britain will leave the bloc in an orderly manner.\n\nIf any of those risks becomes reality, the outlook for Germany would be grimmer, they say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Detailed PMI data are only available under licence from Markit and customers need to apply to Markit for a licence.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo subscribe to the full data, click on the link below: http://www.markit.com/Contact-Us\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information, please phone Markit on +44 20 7260 2454 or email economics@markit.com\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "description": "Employment in Germany's private sector fell for the first time in six years in October, a survey showed on Thursday, suggesting that a third-quarter slowdown in Europe's largest economy could stretch into the closing months of the year.
