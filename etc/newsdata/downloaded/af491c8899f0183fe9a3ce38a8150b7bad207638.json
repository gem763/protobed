Yes, that John Carlson. The defenseman.\n\nCarlson extended his point streak to seven games with an assist in Washington\u2019s 5-3 win over Chicago on Sunday night, bringing his season total to 18 points (three goals, 15 assists) in 10 games.\n\nWith an assist on an Ovechkin goal Sunday, Carlson broke a tie at 17 points with Edmonton Oilers center Connor McDavid \u2014 one of the NHL\u2019s top young superstars \u2014 for sole possession of the league lead. His mark of 15 assists also leads the league, three more than second-place McDavid has.\n\nWhile the sport undoubtedly has trended toward wanting more skilled blueliners, a player like Carlson being a points leader is unheard of. Only two other defensemen in league history have tallied 18 or more points in their teams\u2019 first 10 games of a season \u2014 and they\u2019re Hall of Famers Bobby Orr and Paul Coffey. It hasn\u2019t happened since 1988.\n\n\u201cFor a defenseman, I think there\u2019s so much luck involved,\u201d Carlson said before Friday\u2019s game, a win over the Rangers in which he racked up three assists. \u201cI think I\u2019m making good plays, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not just dumping the puck in, although I did have one or two of those as well. Chances happen, chances get created and sometimes they go in and sometimes they don\u2019t. They seem to be going in right now which is nice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just keep working it the same way. It\u2019s about the process more than what happens on the other side of it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
