Hinch said Thursday before Game 4 of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium. \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s nothing going on other than the competition on the field. The fact that I had to field the question before a really, really cool game at Yankee Stadium is unfortunate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs is typical this time of year, both teams have gone to great lengths to hide their signs from the other. The Yankees, especially, have been vigilant about changing their pitch signs frequently, even with no runners on base; Yankees pitchers have sign sequences taped into the insides of their caps and regularly consult them.\n\n\u201cWe try to mitigate that and look at it between starts,\u201d Yankees lefty James Paxton, who started Game 2 and will start Game 5 on Friday night, said Thursday in regard to the Astros\u2019 efforts to steal signs or predict pitches. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think they had anything, and still don\u2019t. \u2026 We took a look at it, and I don\u2019t think I was giving anything away.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report from SportsNet New York on Wednesday, coaches from the Yankees and Astros engaged in a shouting match during Game 1 Saturday night when the Yankees suspected the Astros were signaling pitch types or locations via a system of whistles. Major League Baseball looked into the allegations and found no wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen I get contacted about some questions about whistling, it made me laugh \u2014 because it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Hinch said Thursday. \u201cHad I known that it would take something like that to set off the Yankees or any other team, we would have practiced it in spring training. It apparently works, even when it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHinch, however, essentially acknowledged the Astros\u2019 efforts to predict the pitch types of Yankees pitchers by watching their movements and looking for a \u201ctell\u201d as to what\u2019s coming. That is such an accepted part of baseball, it would be malpractice if a team were not doing it.\n\n\u201cPitch-tipping is a little bit of a different story,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want us to know what pitch is coming, don\u2019t do something that demonstrates what pitch you\u2019re going to throw. But [the Yankees] are doing the same thing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMLB has cracked down on sign-stealing in recent years, making it clear that, while it is an accepted part of the game, teams cannot use technological means \u2014 including cameras \u2014 to aid in the pursuit.\n\nThe Astros have been at the center of some of the game\u2019s most visible episodes, including last year\u2019s American League Championship Series, when an Astros employee with a camera was removed from the area near the Boston Red Sox dugout and accused of spying. The Astros insisted the employee was engaged in counterespionage \u2014 making sure the Red Sox were not spying on them.\n\nDuring this year\u2019s American League Division Series, Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Tyler Glasnow was convinced he was tipping his pitches against the Astros during his loss in the decisive Game 5.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe can put it to rest,\u201d Hinch said Thursday. \u201cThat will be the last question I answer about pitch-tipping or [sign-]stealing.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Houston Manager A.J.
