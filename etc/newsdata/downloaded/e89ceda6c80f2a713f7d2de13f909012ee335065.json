He used \u201cThe Ridiculist\u201d segment of his weeknight show to trash Grisham and her appearance on FNC\u2019s Fox and Friends Friday morning.\n\n\u201cThe Ridiculist\u201d segment of his show is allegedly one for humor but there wasn\u2019t anything funny about this one. Cooper apparently was triggered with Grisham\u2019s opinion of White House press briefings. Grisham has not held one since she took over that job so Cooper ridiculed her as a groundhog popping up to do an interview on FOX. The segment lasted for 4 minutes, 19 seconds and the snark began immediately. He started off with noting Grisham \u201capparently got a brief furlough from witness protection\u201d and said she was checking in with \u201cher supervisors over at Fox News.\u201d That was as gentle as his commentary got about her. It went downhill from there and he made his attack very personal. It went beyond \u201cpoking fun\u201d at her.\n\n\"Ms. Grisham clearly doesn't get to Broadway enough if she thinks those press conferences are theatre.\" \ud83c\udfad On the #Ridiculist, @AndersonCooper pokes fun at some of the recent turns of phrase offered by rarely seen White House press sec. Stephanie Grisham.https://t.co/rc8u65KR2R pic.twitter.com/C3mu3s7agb \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) October 19, 2019\n\nTo start at the beginning, Stephanie Grisham did an interview on Fox and Friends that covered various topics in the headlines. A big focus was on her defense of acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s appearance before the press corps Thursday. Grisham said the reporters went into a \u201ctizzy\u201d and Mulvaney did \u201ca great job\u201d. Then she said what many observers regularly say about the press \u2013 the press conferences and press briefings, in particular, are turned into theatre performances. She went on to say it is a way for journalists to grab some attention and end up on newscasts. She admitted she hasn\u2019t held a press briefing since she took over that job but said if President Trump wanted her to do so, she would \u201dhappily do it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with the Fox & Friends hosts Friday morning, Grisham made it clear that if the president wanted her to go out and \u201ctake that podium,\u201d referring the podium in front of the press briefing room, she will \u201chappily do it.\u201d She then suggested that when someone, like acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney actually uses the briefing room podium it is more \u201ctheater\u201d than a press conference. \u201cAs evidenced by yesterday with Mick, it was, again, more theater,\u201d Grisham opined. \u201cIt is about people wanting to be on TV and making names for themselves.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s face it \u2013 she said what most of us think every time the press gets a chance to question the president or anyone in his administration on camera. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta is a prime example of what Grisham is addressing. He\u2019s even written a book about his adventures in journalism. Also to keep in mind, FOX beats CNN in primetime ratings every single week, even on coverage of impeachment hearings. CNN, on the other hand, has a different kind of distinction. It is the most polarizing news brand.\n\nCooper mocked Grisham\u2019s choice of words and suggested she get out and go to the theatre more often. She responded in the best way possible \u2013 she essentially said, you know, she would do that but she\u2019s busy being a single working mom doing three jobs in the White House besides raising her kids. So, no, Stephanie Grisham doesn\u2019t get to the theatre often. That\u2019s a luxury that professional men like Anderson Cooper have, due to less strenuous personal obligations.\n\n\u201cMiss Grisham clearly doesn\u2019t get to Broadway enough if she, you know, thinks those press conferences are theater. Maybe on one of the seven days a week she\u2019s not doing her job, she can catch maybe a matinee of \u2018Hamilton,'\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAlso, hate to break it to her but TV reporters are already on TV.\u201d Grisham says he \u201cgot that part right.\u201d \u201cI am a single mom who (proudly) holds three roles in the White House, and I am doing the very best I can. But I definitely don\u2019t get to Broadway enough,\u201d she told Business Insider. Cooper also noted that Grisham had used the defense of \u201ctheater\u201d before, and suggested that she needed to workshop her talking points.\n\nGrisham responded Sunday in just the right way. She chose to take the high road and not go personal on Anderson Cooper, as he did against her. She didn\u2019t attack his intelligence or character. She reminded everyone that people working in the White House are human beings, too.\n\n\u201cI think CNN has lost sight of the fact that we are human beings,\u201d Grisham said in response. \u201cJust as Anderson Cooper has a job to do, working for a company he is proud of, so do I.\u201d \u201cI also imagine he has a personal life, where he has to juggle quite a bit \u2013 and the same goes for me,\u201d Grisham added.\n\nThe press secretary is right when she says a return to real journalism would be nice.\n\nAmerica needs real journalism. Real journalists don't have an agenda. They gather and present the news in an unbiased manner. They report the facts\u2014and let the citizens decide. But audio of @CNN meetings, captured by @Project_Veritas, expose a very real agenda. \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) October 18, 2019", "description": "Triggered show host alert.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0ae6bbe4-8382-4a05-9bc0-a5c6a3b3689e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
