We all aim to reflect our personalities through what we choose to wear and what we bring into our homes. We (oftentimes reluctantly\u2026) follow trends, trying out a Bardot neckline or perhaps a few new velvet cushion covers. For example, the ubiquity of maximalism across both fashion and interiors has seen us hang the most exquisitely detailed wallcoverings and don the boldest print dresses.\n\nHowever, the overarching message coming from both fashion and interiors is one of investment; buying fewer, better quality items for your home and for your wardrobe. The line between fashion and interiors is blurring where these higher-quality investment pieces are concerned. This week, I\u2019ve gathered three of the most exciting collaborations bringing us heirloom-quality pieces for the home, inspired by some of the most iconic runway minds.\n\nFirst is the coming-together of bespoke kitchen designer Lanserring and one of the UK\u2019s most successful independent fashion brands, Jenny Packham, to create Esquisse, a walk-in dressing space boasting luxe finishes like oiled brass and rich timbers.\n\nRed carpets the world over have been skimmed by the hems of Packham\u2019s iconic designs, worn by some of the most revered women of this generation, including Uma Thurman, Angelina Jolie, Emily Blunt, Dita Von Teese, the Duchess of Cambridge and Taylor Swift, while Lanserring kitchens can be seen in some of the world\u2019s most sought after homes.\n\nBernd Radaschitz and Alex Beaugard, co-founder and design director of Lanserring, tell me: \u201cWhile our projects to date have been centred around designing haute-couture, bespoke kitchens, we are often asked by our clients to create dressing spaces. Working on these projects with internationally renowned and respected fashion designer, Jenny Packham, has been a unique opportunity to conceptualise such beautiful dressing spaces.\u201d\n\nThe team adds: \u201cThe Esquisse has been designed through the eyes of the maker, combing both Lanserring and Jenny Packham\u2019s vision. Jenny knows exactly how her clients feel, not only when they are wearing her garments, but also understanding what kind of space they are looking for when they are getting ready, whether that is for the day ahead or for a special occasion.\u201d\n\nNext is the new collaboration between heritage British pottery, Burleigh, and global fashion brand Ralph Lauren. The Spring 2019 collection comprises dining sets in three Ralph Lauren motifs on traditional Burleigh shapes.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s leading fashion designers, Ralph Lauren has been a fan of the English pottery for many years \u2013 a relationship that has culminated in a transatlantic collaboration that celebrates its authenticity and the skill that goes into creating a piece of Burleigh.\n\nFinally, fashion house Laura Ashley has teamed up with heritage carpet maker, Brintons, to create a new range of carpets in classic Laura Ashley colours and styles. This is the most recent instalment in a series of collaborations between the quintessentially British brands that has spanned a decade.\n\nLisa Conway, residential marketing manager at Brintons, tells me that it is the deep-rooted connection that Laura Ashley customers have to the clothing that translates into the home market. Conway says: \u201cBoth Laura Ashley and Brintons have a strong heritage of creating intricate, beautiful prints based on heritage designs from vast historical archives, so the collaboration feels very natural.\u201d\n\nThe 12 new carpet designs in the collection combine the elegant, country-style designs that have made Laura Ashley the brand it is today with the home comfort of a soft carpet from Britain\u2019s leading carpet manufacturer.", "description": "The parallels between fashion and interior design are multiple.
