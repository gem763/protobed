The terrain made it difficult to land the aircraft, so the troops jumped into a cold, waist-deep river.\n\nThey had the task of hiking up the mountain to capture Hekmatyar but encountered heavy enemy fire once out of the chopper.\n\n\u201cIn the face of rocket-propelled grenade, sniper and machine-gun fire, Sergeant Williams led an Afghan Commando element across a fast-moving, ice-cold and waist-deep river to fight its way up a terraced mountain to the besieged lead element of the assault force,\u201d the statement read. \u201cSergeant Williams then set up a base of fire that the enemy was not able to overcome.\u201d\n\nWhen a group of American troops became pinned down and wounded, Williams climbed up the cliff to help conduct a rescue and repair the team's satellite radio. He exposed himself to enemy fire again to move several casualties down the near-vertical mountainside while carrying and loading the wounded into helicopters, officials said.\n\nGREEN BERET TO RECEIVE MEDAL OF HONOR FOR ACTIONS IN 2008 AFGHANISTAN BATTLE\n\nHis actions helped save the lives of four critically wounded soldiers and prevented the lead element of the assault force from being overrun, the announcement read.\n\nMore than 150 enemy fighters were killed during the raid, according to military officials.\n\nWilliams joined the Army in 2005. He deployed to Afghanistan multiple times throughout his military career.
