That ended decades of declines in overall land prices that followed the bursting of a 1980s asset bubble.\n\nThe world\u2019s third-biggest economy is now increasingly a tale of two Japans, with huge urban centres like greater Tokyo and Osaka vibrant and growing, while the rapidly greying and depopulating hinterlands pacing an overall population decline.\n\nThis poses fresh problems of economic equality in a historically egalitarian society and where Abe has made regional revitalisation, as well breaking free of deflation nationwide, focal points of \u201cAbenomics.\u201d\n\nGovernment surveys have shown a steady recovery of land prices, backed by surging numbers of foreign visitors and demand for office space.\n\nThe property rise has spread to regional cities that have tourist attractions. A survey by the National Tax Agency in July showed Okinawa Prefecture, with its tropical beach resorts, had the greatest increase in Japan in 2018.\n\n\u201cLand prices in regional cities such as Fukuoka and Sapporo have risen as fast as those in Tokyo and Osaka,\u201d said Shigeo Hirayama, senior consulting fellow at Tokyo-based Urban Research Institute. \u201cBut that trend has not penetrated into their surrounding areas, which is why people do not share the view price is rising evenly.\u201d\n\nA manager at a service company wrote in the Reuters survey, \u201cThere is a deepening bipolarisation between bigger and smaller cities.\u201d This trend will continue as Japan\u2019s population falls, said Urban Research\u2019s Hirayama.\n\nThe Reuters Corporate Survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research, polled 504 large and midsize firms with managers responding on condition of anonymity to speak freely. Some 230-240 answered the questions on land prices.", "description": "Japanese companies say land prices appear to be overheating in big cities but not in the countryside, a Reuters poll showed, highlighting a growing geographic divide even as the government seeks to spur inflation and revive regional economies.", "authors": ["Junko Fujita", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
