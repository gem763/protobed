One of the few isolated incidents were tensions and brief clashes between far-left Antifa activists and others occurring at a rally for populist People\u2019s Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nWith the two official election debates, in English and in French, now over, the candidates are sprinting for the finish. Recent polling suggests Trudeau\u2019s Liberals could be losing valuable ground in Quebec to the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\nThe surge in popularity for the Bloc and its leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet come after strong debate performances in both French and English.\n\nScott Reid, the former advisor to Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin, commented on the performance saying: \u201cIn Quebec, you see the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois coming on like gangbusters. Between TVA and the two commissioned debates, I think Blanchet probably had the best performance of all six leaders.\u201d\n\nWatching Blackface Enthusiast Justin Trudeau squirm is SO cringeworthy\u2026 https://t.co/6sDUw7gQcE \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 8, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, left-wing New Democrat Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh has said that he would be open to the possibility of forming a ruling coalition with Trudeau and the Liberals in order to prevent a Conservative government.\n\nPolling website 338 Canada puts the Tories at a 50.4 per cent chance of winning the most seats in the election, but only a 9.8 per cent chance of forming a majority government. The Liberals have just a 13.7 per cent chance of forming a new majority in the House of Commons.", "description": "Canadian Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau wore a bulletproof vest at a campaign event in what some are calling an \"unprecedented\" move.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1175169800-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
