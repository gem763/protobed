Turns out you don\u2019t need to be gay after all. There are some wonderful people of the opposite sex out there, you just haven\u2019t found them yet.\n\nThis \u201cadvice\u201d is brought to you by actor-singer Miley Cyrus who is currently having a heterosexual dalliance with a man called Cody Simpson, who has very blonde hair and is a God amongst the tweens. Last Sunday Cyrus and Simpson giggled together on Instagram Live while Cyrus shared some relationship advice.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up,\u201d Cyrus told her audience. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good people with dicks out there, you just gotta find them. You just gotta find a dick that\u2019s not a dick, you know what I mean?\u201d\n\nCyrus continued this eloquent train of thought: \u201cI always thought I had to be gay, because I just thought all guys are evil, but that\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are good people out there that just happen to have dicks. I\u2019ve only ever met one, and he\u2019s on this live.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t know much about Cyrus\u2019s personal life because you have far better things to do with your own life, a quick recap: the star used to be married to Liam Hemsworth and then briefly dated Kaitlynn Carter before shacking up with Simpson. Despite largely dating men, Cyrus has been very vocal about the fact she is \u201cpansexual\u201d and \u201cgenderqueer\u201d, so her flippant comments came as a shock to many. Pretty much every single queer person out there has been told that their sexuality is just a phase, or they haven\u2019t found the right person to be heterosexual with yet; hearing those damaging misconceptions repeated by a celebrity who has made much of her own queerness is hugely disappointing. Also disappointing is the fact that Cyrus\u2019s comments about \u201cevil men\u201d propagate the idea that lesbians are man-haters who \u201cchoose\u201d to be gay because they can\u2019t stand dudes.\n\nFollowing a backlash, Cyrus went on Instagram again to clarify the matter. \u201cI was talking shit about sucky guys, but let me be clear, YOU don\u2019t CHOOSE your sexuality,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou are born as you are. It has always been my priority to protect the LGBTQ community I am part of.\u201d\n\nSorry Cyrus, but I think you need to do a little better than that. Calling yourself \u201cpansexual\u201d or \u201cgenderqueer\u201d does not give you carte blanche to repeat damaging stereotypes about the queer community. You don\u2019t get to use queerness as an exotic PR platform one day and then turn around and treat homosexuality as the losers\u2019 option the next. Cyrus may brush off her comments as a joke but excuse me if I don\u2019t find anything particularly funny about a couple in a heterosexual relationship giggling over the woman\u2019s gay past like it is a hilarious phase. Cyrus has an enormous platform and a young fan base; what she says matters. Particularly during a time when LGBTQ hate crime is on the rise. You don\u2019t choose your sexuality as she belatedly pointed out. But you do choose to be a moron.\n\nHarvey Weinstein\u2019s staggering lack of shame\n\nIf you need any more evidence that \u201ccancel culture\u201d is complete nonsense let me refer you to Weinstein\u2019s Wednesday night out. The disgraced producer, who clearly doesn\u2019t have any sense of shame whatsoever, turned up at a stand-up night for young artists at a Manhattan bar \u2013 when some brave women called him out they were booed and ejected from the bar. Once again women are punished for speaking out while powerful men seem to think they can do whatever they like.\n\nSexist \u2018ladies menu\u2019 banned\n\nLa Rosa Nautica, a super-fancy restaurant in Peru, is being fined for giving women menus without prices on them. (This is something old-fashioned restaurants do when a male-female couple comes to dine; it assumes that the man will pay and the little lady will not want to worry her sweet head about the cost.) \u201cThese small things may seem harmless,\u201d one official responsible for fining the restaurant explained. \u201cBut at the end of the day they are the basis of a chauvinistic construct reinforcing differences between men and women.\u201d\n\nPSA: stalking isn\u2019t romantic\n\n\u201cA lovesick German teenager outdid Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo by scaling a 4m (13ft) prison wall and climbing up to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s barred window,\u201d the BBC reports. What that sentence should actually say is \u201crejected man doesn\u2019t let prison walls stop him from stalking his ex\u201d. This shouldn\u2019t need to be said but stalking is not romantic. The media needs to stop pushing the idea that men shouldn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer.\n\nFTC cracks down on \u2018stalkerware\u2019 apps for first time\n\nThe number of people who have discovered spyware on their devices has risen by at least 35% in the past year, according to Kaspersky, a cybsersecurity firm. Stalkerware apps (sometimes called \u201cspouseware\u201d) are used to secretly monitor digital activity and can be used by controlling and abusive partners. This week the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) barred a US company from selling stalkerware apps; a good first step towards battling a rapidly escalating problem.\n\nLebanese \u2018kick queen\u2019: what happened next?\n\nLast week\u2019s newsletter featured a video of Malak Alaywe, a badass Lebanese protester, kicking an armed bodyguard. A few readers have written in wondering what happened next. Happily, it seems that Alaywe, who has been dubbed the \u201ckick queen\u201d, is thriving. She got married on Wednesday and celebrated on the streets of Beirut with protesters. (By the way, if you haven\u2019t seen the \u201cbaby shark\u201d protest video, you must.)\n\nModern Love has an old-fashioned problem\n\nThe New York Times\u2019s popular Modern Love column has been turned into an Amazon Prime series. The series does not feature a single woman of colour.\n\nNew beetle species named after Greta Thunberg\n\nThe tiny beetle, which has no eyes or wings, is being named \u201cNelloptodes gretae\u201d in honour of the teenage climate activist. I\u2019m sure she is thrilled.", "description": "Calling yourself \u2018pansexual\u2019 or \u2018genderqueer\u2019 does not give you carte blanche to repeat damaging stereotypes", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97d1f42635589ee57ef1fe2823d69ff611f5c0f0/0_91_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=adf57bad2e2e228d60bf8d3a18fbfe45", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
