They ended up sitting in front of the fireplace together, locked in rapt conversation.\"\n\nNot everyone at the exclusive dinner party was happy with Diana and Gere's instant connection, however.\n\n\"Me\" by Elton John ($17.60) Order on Amazon here\n\n\"Judging by the kind of looks he kept shooting them, Diana and Richard Gere's newly blossoming friendship was not going down well with Sylvester Stallone at all,\" he explained. \"I think he may have turned up to the party with the express intention of picking Diana up, only to find his plans for the evening ruined.\"\n\nAs their guests moved to the dinner table, John and Furnish noticed that two people were noticeably absent: Gere and Stallone. John remembers asking his partner to go find them before he reported back that they had a \"situation\" on their hands.\n\nSEE ALSO: New interview casts 'suspicious' shadow on Princess Diana's death\n\n\"It transpired that he'd discovered Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere in the corridor, squaring up to each other, apparently about to settle their differences over Diana by having a fist-fight,\" he writes, before revealing that the \"Rocky\" star \"stormed off\" out of the party following the dinner, still angry that he missed his chance with Diana.\n\n\"'I never would have come,' he snapped, as David and I showed him to the door, 'if I'd known Prince f---in' Charming was gonna be here.' Then he added: 'If I'd wanted her, I would've taken her!'\" John writes in the excerpt. \"We managed to wait until his car was out of sight before we started laughing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Diana was \"unruffled\" by the commotion.\n\n\"Maybe she hadn't realised what was happening,\" John muses. \"Or maybe stuff like that happened all the time and she was used to it.\"\n\n\"Me\" by Elton John will be released on October 15.
