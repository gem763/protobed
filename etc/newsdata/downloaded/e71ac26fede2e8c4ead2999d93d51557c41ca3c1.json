My go-to for many years was wine \u2014 daily bottles of wine. But now, after living clearheaded for over four years, my coping mechanisms have turned to increased time on self-care: solo trips to New York City to feel alive; texting my husband to let him know that when he comes home I will be leaving for a few hours because I have to; timing when I take my medication so that I know I have enough hours in the day to parent and be alive and think and make decisions before the medication wears off; buying overpriced coffee and cake pops; praying out loud in the car before I take my children anywhere; writing; singing; tickling my children and hearing their giggle; and eating ice cream right out of the container. It also means attending weekly therapy sessions and working with a psychiatrist to manage the right medication for me. It means spending the money and doing some hard work to feel better.", "description": "\u2018I move into fight, flight and freeze\u2019", "authors": ["Kate Gentry"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AsWzaLCE-EO_GCDL1RSg6yvOAS4=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RE6E4ATJPVHDROQWHNM52LM7EE.jpg"}
