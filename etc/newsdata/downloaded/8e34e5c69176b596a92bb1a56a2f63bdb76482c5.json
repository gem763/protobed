Hyde was later tossed in the eighth inning for arguing balls and strikes. (Chris O'meara/Associated Press)\n\nA long road trip and a long day came to a quick end thanks to the most efficient start the Baltimore Orioles have received in 2019, but it wasn\u2019t enough for a doubleheader sweep at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\n[Game 1 box score: Orioles 4, Rays 2]\n\nRight-hander Gabriel Ynoa cruised to a season high in innings, but the Orioles\u2019 bats backing him managed little against a collection of Tampa Bay Rays pitchers in a 2-0 loss in the second game of Tuesday\u2019s doubleheader. Baltimore won the first game, 4-2.\n\nFrustration with the offensive struggles boiled over in the eighth when Orioles Manager Brandon Hyde was ejected after arguing a check-swing, strike-three call on pinch hitter Trey Mancini, kicking dirt on home plate amid his discourse with home plate umpire Lance Barrett.\n\nYnoa wasn\u2019t announced as the Orioles\u2019 starter until Hyde\u2019s meeting with the media between games and had pitched only once since Aug. 23, an inning of relief against the Washington Nationals in the second game of this eight-game road trip.\n\n[Game 2 box score: Rays 2, Orioles 0]\n\nHe was well rested, but he didn\u2019t need many pitches to get through the game. In his 6 \u2153 innings \u2014 his most since a career-high eight against the Rays in September 2017 \u2014 Ynoa threw only 67 pitches.\n\nIn the first game of just the third doubleheader in Tropicana Field history, lefty Ty Blach held the Rays to two runs in five innings before four relievers combined for four scoreless innings. The Orioles\u2019 bullpen stranded the tying run in scoring position in the first three of those innings before Mark Trumbo added an insurance run with a pinch-hit RBI double in the ninth.", "description": "Lefty Ty Blach and four relievers help produce 4-2 victory over Rays in Game 1, but Gabriel Ynoa\u2019s strong start in Game 2 goes for naught in 2-0 defeat.", "authors": ["Baltimore Sun", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PnOLPWtR5W9jyGcCRzcb2jVxe04=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZ6I67WOYUI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
