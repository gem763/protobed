Let\u2019s go Mets!\u201d It was Labor Day in the nation\u2019s capital, but it could have been any day or night in Flushing.\n\nBy the time the Nats backers got into it, the New York Mets led by seven, and it was for a reason that would seem odd to anyone who hasn\u2019t spent the summer here: Gerardo Parra, taking his first at-bat after replacing the injured Adam Eaton, stepped to the plate, and thousands of fans stood, clapped their hands in a chomping motion and swayed to \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d Parra struck out, and they sat back down.\n\nThe Nationals, with Monday\u2019s 7-3 loss as a notable exception, have been a wonder to watch for more than three months now. They are increasingly likely to host the National League wild-card game, though with seven games remaining against the NL East-leading Atlanta Braves \u2014 whose advantage is now 6\u00bd games \u2014 the division title hasn\u2019t quite been decided. They have a current MVP candidate in third baseman Anthony Rendon, a future MVP candidate in outfielder Juan Soto, a Hall of Famer in right-hander Max Scherzer \u2014 and a bullpen that keeps eyes glued to the action, even if they\u2019re peeking through cracks in fingers.\n\nWhat they have right now, too, is a fan base that isn\u2019t reaching for its wallet to push them through this pennant race.\n\n[Joe Ross struggles in a loss to the Mets, forcing the Nationals to reexamine a difficult question]\n\nHere\u2019s what we know: With Monday\u2019s crowd of 25,329 \u2014 which includes all those wearing Mets gear \u2014 the Nationals are now averaging 27,944 fans per game. Only four teams in the National League \u2014 Arizona, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and criminally bad Miami \u2014 have fewer people showing up to their games than the scorching-toward-the-postseason Nats. That\u2019s down \u2014 and significantly \u2014 from last year\u2019s average of 31,230, a 10 percent drop. The Nats are on pace to draw fewer people than in any season since 2011, not only before they had won a division title but before they had so much as had a winning year.\n\nThere are so many interesting aspects to this team to dissect. Yet sit at the ballpark on a lovely Labor Day, and it\u2019s hard not to be struck by the atmosphere, the empty seats and sections, and ask, \u201cDoes it matter to the team?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it always matters, especially in games where you feel like you\u2019re behind, or a night game [followed by a] day game and you\u2019re a little tired, that energy that the fans can bring,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner said. \u201cYou saw their guys over there bringing their energy today. I think that\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nThe crowds at Nationals Park over the remaining 13 home dates won\u2019t determine whether closer Sean Doolittle returns to form or whether right fielder Adam Eaton can bounce back from the bruise on the back of his knee that caused him to come out of Monday\u2019s game. But it is a way, albeit from an armchair, to evaluate the health of a franchise, the relationship between fan base and city.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a weird year,\u201d said first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, who has played more home games in front of Washington crowds than anyone in Nats history.\n\nHe\u2019s right: an 82-80 2018 followed by an offseason in which Bryce Harper departed didn\u2019t exactly send people flooding to the box office over the winter, and a 19-31 start didn\u2019t have them planning late-summer visits to the ballpark in the spring. Throw in the context of attendance being down across MLB, and the Nationals were prepared for something of an attendance hit this season.\n\nBut a reasonable question would be: How much of it is on fans not finding the passion they once had, and how much is the team misreading its own fans?\n\n[Boswell: The Nats simply can\u2019t let Anthony Rendon \u2014 his bat, his glove, his personality \u2014 get away]\n\nThis isn\u2019t a science. The Nats, like most teams, structure the pricing on their tickets in tiers. Opening Day has, across the board, the highest prices \u2014 and that\u2019s by far Nationals Park\u2019s largest crowd of the year, 42,263. That one date is impervious to pricing. Washington is an event city. Opening Day is an event. Boom! Sellout.\n\nSince then, the Nationals have hosted 26 dates that qualify either as a \u201cprime\u201d or \u201cmarquee\u201d tier. Though the Nats also change ticket prices over the course of the year based on demand \u2014 meaning, say, a ticket for the same seat to Monday\u2019s game might have cost more April 1 than it did Aug. 1 \u2014 they identify the games that fans are likely to seek out and charge more. Gouging? No. Supply and demand? Yes.\n\nBut what if you misread the demand? Of the 26 home dates with higher prices since the opener \u2014 including Monday, which was a \u201cprime\u201d game \u2014 the Nats have drawn fewer than their average 11 times. The two games last week against the Baltimore Orioles \u2014 crowds of 24,946 and 25,174 \u2014 fall into that category. So do Memorial Day and Fourth of July games against Miami, potentially big baseball days when only 21,048 and 27,350 turned out, respectively.\n\nHad the Nats knocked the prices down \u2014 not a discount, but to the \u201cregular\u201d tier \u2014 would more people have shown up? Impossible to say. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not fun to speculate.\n\nWhat we\u2019re learning, though, is that it\u2019s not as simple as \u201cwin and they\u2019ll come.\u201d Not in Washington, at least. There\u2019s an endless list of reasons people don\u2019t show up to a given ballgame, ranging from the weather to their wallet, including the start of school or the start of soccer practice, impacted by inconveniences such as Metro\u2019s shutdown of parts of two lines that extend into Virginia for much of the summer. Criticizing fans for not coming is folly. Wondering why attendance is down is important in evaluating a franchise\u2019s relationship with its supporters.\n\n\u201cD.C.\u2019s a very predictable city,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cI could\u2019ve told you no one was going to be here today. For a lot of people, it\u2019s the last day before their kids go back to school. It\u2019s the last holiday of summer. People are going to be on the waterfront or whatever. There\u2019s just other things to do in D.C.\u201d\n\n[Juan Soto is improving his defense one step at a time]\n\nTrue. But there are other things to do in New York, too. Like, a bazillion other things.\n\n\u201cBut the Mets, they have five generations of fans, or four generations of fans, that all grew up with that team,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cMaybe their dad\u2019s team won a World Series, and they went because of that. That stuff matters, too.\u201d\n\nWhich is another reminder that even though Nationals Park is hosting its 12th season, even though baseball has been back in Washington for 15 campaigns, the sport isn\u2019t quite ingrained here.\n\nThe playoffs, they won\u2019t be a problem. We know from past experience that the stands will be full, most fans will be wearing red, and the atmosphere will be electric. It was like that for decisive Game 5s of division series in 2012, \u201916 and \u201917. Start, say, Max Scherzer in a wild-card game that begins the postseason with what\u2019s essentially a Game 7, and the park would pulse.\n\n\u201cI always say: They\u2019re the 26th man,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cThey do play a part.\u201d\n\nMonday afternoon, when Mets closer Edwin D\u00edaz struck out Matt Adams to end it, the only fans playing a part were those in New York colors down the left field line. It\u2019s not the most important aspect to the second half of a 2019 season that has turned out to be ridiculously fun. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s noticed, from the dugout to the ownership box, for sure.", "description": "As the Nats steam toward the postseason, the atmosphere at the ballpark continues to be lacking.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Barry Svrluga Became A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post In December He Arrived At The Post In To Cover Football", "Basketball At The University Of Maryland"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GFIgWpGDBynYdGsIKGj4-whKEUE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KGE5R5GNYYI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
