(Yonhap/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nLeading South Korean K-pop singer and actress Sulli was found dead in her house south of the capital on Monday in what police said may have been suicide.\n\nThe 25-year-old started her career as a child actress in 2005 and later joined a girl group as a teenager, before announcing she was quitting the entertainment industry in 2014. She said then that she was mentally and physically exhausted after suffering from malicious comments and false rumors online. She formally left her band the following year to resume an acting career.\n\nLast year, she took the rare step of speaking out about her mental health issues, saying she had suffered from panic disorder since she was young and also had social phobia.\n\nIf she is found to have taken her own life, it would highlight the huge pressures on K-pop stars exerted by exploitative management companies and demanding fans, and the lack of mental health support.\n\nThe star, whose legal name is Choi Jin-ri, was found dead by her agent on Monday afternoon in a two-story house in Seongnam, the Yonhap news agency reported. No suicide note has been found.\n\n\u201cChoi seemed to have lived alone in the house. It seems that she took her own life, but we are also looking into other possibilities,\u201d a police official said.\n\nSulli consciously challenged the notions on how a female Kpop star should behave, but she suffered massively as a result.\n\nShe was viciously attacked online in 2014 after paparazzi photos revealed she was dating an older rapper. K-pop stars usually face pressure not to date because it can disillusion their fans.\n\nShe would also often appear without a bra, saying she felt more comfortable without one, something that some Korean women found liberating but others savagely criticized.\n\nIn June, she became a co-host of a TV show entitled \u201cThe Night of Hate Comments,\u201d in which celebrity guests discussed their reactions to hateful comments, malicious rumors and cyberbullying.\n\nYonhap said she had suffered criticism and drawn support for what it called her \u201cbold and carefree character.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven close people left me. I was hurt by them and felt there was nobody who understands me, which made me fall apart,\u201d she said in an Instagram video posted last year.\n\nRead more\n\nSex scandals stain the clean-cut image of South Korea\u2019s K-pop\n\nHow K-pop is luring young North Koreans to cross the line\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "South Korean actress and singer Sulli, 25, had been subjected to online hate attacks and had spoken out about mental health problems.", "authors": ["Min Joo Kim", "Assistant Reporter In Seoul Covering South", "North Korea.", "Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea.", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
