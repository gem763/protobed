Its message will essentially be that while it could act in December if needed, it won't unless there are big uncertainties on the economy,\" said Sumitomo Mitsui's Ichikawa.\n\nFading expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the Fed have lifted the two-year U.S. bond yield to 1.644%, compared with a two-year low of 1.368% set in early October.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 1.833% , near a 1-1/2-month high of 1.860% touched earlier this week.\n\nThat has helped to lift the dollar against the yen. The dollar was traded at 108.87 yen, after having hit a three-month high of 109.07 yen\n\nThe euro stood at $1.11135, having bounced off from Tuesday's low of $1.10735.\n\nSterling was little changed after Britain decided to hold an election on Dec. 12 following Prime Minister Boris Johnson winning approval from parliament for an early ballot aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock.\n\nWhile Johnson seeks to gain a parliamentary majority to ratify his Brexit deal, the election would be highly unpredictable as Brexit has fatigued and enraged swathes of voters, while eroding traditional loyalties to the two major parties, Conservative and Labour.\n\nThe currency last traded at $1.2866,\n\nOil prices were little changed, with Brent crude futures up 0.02% at $61.60 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.13% to $55.47 per barrel.
