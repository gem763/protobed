Hopefully the Gardai will be able to deal with the matter.'\n\nA force spokeswoman said: 'Gardai is investigating a theft from a shop in Kentstown, Navan, Co. Meath, which occurred on Sunday, October 20, 2019.\n\n'Two females entered a shop and stole property including a charity box and fled the scene on foot. No arrests have been made and investigations are ongoing.'\n\nThe video has been viewed over 400,000 times on social media, where people were appalled.\n\nAnne Davidson fumed: 'Pond life. Hope they get caught.' While Chris Allan called it 'lower than a snake's belly'.", "description": "The shameless pair of women stole from the Londis in Kentstown, County Meath, which was raising money for a charity which carries out river rescues.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/09/20073342-0-image-a-2_1571817778991.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
