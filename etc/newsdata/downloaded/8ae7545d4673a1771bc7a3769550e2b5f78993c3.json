Linick is expected to meet with congressional staff in a secure location on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe unusual nature and timing of the briefing \u2013 during a congressional recess \u2013 suggest it may be connected to a recent intelligence community whistleblower allegation which describes, in part, the State Department\u2019s role in coordinating interactions between Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, and Ukrainian officials.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abcnews.Go.Com Politics State-Dept-Inspector-General-Expected-Urgent-Ukraine-Briefing Story Id"], "top_image": ""}
