Holoprosencephaly is an abnormality of brain development in which the brain doesn't properly divide into the right and left hemispheres. The condition can also impair the development of the head and face. There are four types of holoprosencephaly, distinguished by severity. From most to least severe, the types are alobar, semi-lobar, lobar, and middle interhemispheric variant. The cause of HPE is unknown. Often, no specific cause can be identified. It is estimated that HPE affects one in 5,000-10,000 live births. Since many pregnancies with an affected foetus' end in early miscarriage, the frequency among all pregnancies may be as high as one in 200-250. Given the known poor prognosis, women are offered a choice of continuing with the pregnancy with the support of the hospital team, or termination of the pregnancy. Some women may choose to terminate the pregnancy. For those who choose to continue, treatment is based on management of the condition of the baby and support for the parents. Current studies indicate that only three per cent of all foetuses with HPE survive to delivery and the vast majority of these infants do not survive past the first six months of life.

This is far greater than any likely human exposure.\n\nAll of the offspring had defects in the structures of their forebrain. The severely affected offspring, who had the highest dose, had what would be diagnosed as HPE.\n\nThe baby mice also had hypoplasia, which is when the upper jaw, cheekbones and eye sockets have not grown as much as the rest of the face, as well as hypotelorism, when the eyes are very close together.\n\nProfesor Lipinksi said: 'This is all about timing. The critical period is very early in development.'\n\nThe authors wrote: 'Human exposure to PBO and its potential contribution to etiologically complex birth defects should be rigorously examined.'\n\nThe team also studied how strongly the sonic hedgehog pathway was inhibited in mouse and human cells in the lab.\n\nA previous study of household dust found PBO to be a 'top 10' common chemical contaminant, indicating its abundance in the environment.\n\nA 2002 study found PBO in 75 per cent of air samples provided by pregnant women.\n\nBut Professor Lipinski said: 'It's been said that birth defects like holoprosencephaly are caused by \"a little bit of this and a little bit of that\".'\n\nPBO's influence on human health has been the subject of relatively little scientific scrutiny, with only a handful of published studies.\n\nAt present, labels of products containing PBO provide no cautionary information for exposure during pregnancy.\n\nAn independent expert not involved in the latest study said the findings indicated that 'the relevance to humans and human exposure levels may be considered to be low.'\n\nDr Peter Jenkinson, managing director of Consultancy for Environmental & Human Toxicology and Risk Assessment (CEHTRA) noted gaps in the paper.\n\nHe said: 'The authors could have done a little more research to confirm their assumption about the properties of PBO.\n\n'The EU has no serious concerns about the safety of PBO.\n\n'In an orally dosed study in rats, the majority of the substance was recovered in the faeces and the rest in the urine.\n\n'In a human clinical trial dermal absorption was less than three per cent of the applied dose... and there was no evidence to indicate that dermally applied PBO accumulated in the skin.'", "description": "Scientists at at University of Wisconsin-Madison's School of Veterinary Medicine found mice given a dose of piperonyl butoxide had offspring with stunted brain development.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/13/20083176-0-image-a-30_1571835053115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
