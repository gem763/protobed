We now know more than two dozen other victims were also reported in the same region of Panama, including a young woman from the United States found murdered earlier this year. A return trip to the scene of these events\u2014as well as renewed sleuthing by best-selling author Dr. Kathy Reichs and other forensic specialists\u2014provides a fresh take on these cold cases. In the first chapter of this series, we traveled to the last place Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon, the two young Dutch students who were killed just over three years ago, were known to have been alive and apparently signalling for help. In the second chapter, we looked at the usual and unusual suspects and witnesses in the \"Lost Girls\" case. Here, we visit the Serpent River, where key evidence was found\u2014and misinterpreted. In the days to come, we will discover the secrets of a Panama morgue, and look at any possible connections to the case of American graduate student Catherine Johannet, murdered in February this year.\n\nBOQUETE, Panama\u2014The travel ads and tourist brochures all call Panama a paradise.\n\nHigh in the pristine cloud forests of the Talamanca Cordillera, near the Continental Divide, it\u2019s easy enough to imagine you\u2019re in eco-phile heaven.
