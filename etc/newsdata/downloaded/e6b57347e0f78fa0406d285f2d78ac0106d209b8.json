Luckily, there\u2019s a whole kingdom of plant options to be explored. \u2018While certain plants might have their time in the Instagram limelight, there are so many other plants that demand equal attention,\u2019 says Sprout Home founder Tara Heibel. Not to mention that once a plant becomes an overnight sensation, the price tag instantly goes up. But \u2018there are a lot of amazing plants that are beautiful, can be easy to care for, and won\u2019t break the bank,\u2019 says Erin Harding, author of How to Raise a Plant and Make It Love You Back. In that spirit, we asked 16 plant experts \u2014 including plant-shop owners, plant buyers, plant writers, and plant influencers \u2014 for their favorite underappreciated, underexposed, and underrated plants.\n\nFor the beginner plant parent\n\nWatermelon Peperomia Plant The Peperomia genus was recommended by many of our experts, with Ariel Ries, a plant specialist at Tula, calling it \u2018a really great underappreciated group.\u2019 According to Heibel, most varieties \u2018can withstand some dry time and a wide range of light conditions\u2019 and can bring \u2018a little colour\u2019 and \u2018a quirky architecture\u2019 to a drab office desk. Vanessa Chinga-Haven and Greg Beyer, plant buyers at the boutique Homecoming, especially like the Watermelon Peperomia because of its unique leaf pattern resembling a watermelon rind. \u00a311 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBaby Rubber Plant Three of our experts also pointed to the Peperomia obtusifolia member of the family. \u2018Peperomia are underappreciated houseplants and perfect for small-space living because they are relatively diminutive plants,\u2019 says Summer Rayne Oakes, author of the forthcoming book How to Make a Plant Love You and host of the YouTube series Plant One on Me. Heibel calls this little guy \u2018a trusty and bright companion.\u2019 Because they are semi-succulent, \u2018they like to really dry out between waterings.\u2019 Ries adds that they \u2018love indirect bright light.\u2019 For this reason, our experts say it is important to use a planter with a drainage hole and a well-draining potting soil. \u2018Though the succulent-like leaves are the showy part of the Peperomia, it can also produce white stem flowers from spring to fall,\u2019 says Ries. \u00a310 at Hortology Buy\n\nSchefflera arboricola This Schefflera arboricola, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is super-underrated and undemanding, say Chinga-Haven and Beyer. A versatile plant, it can grow quite tall and is the right size and shape to \u2018fill a corner well.\u2019 They advise keeping it in bright, indirect sunlight and watering weekly for best results. \u00a316 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nSansevieria cylindrica \u2018Most people know about the snake plant, Sansevieria trifasciata, and how hard it is to kill. But it has weirder (yet just as low-maintenance) cousins,\u2019 say Chantal Aida Gordon and Ryan Benoit, authors of How to Window Box and founders of the Horticult. The spear plant is a little more special than the more common flat-leaf varieties. Both Darryl Cheng, author of The New Plant Parent, and Heibel recommend the Sansevieria cylindrica, or African spear plant, for its sculptural, cylindrical shape and low-maintenance care regimen. \u2018These guys are succulents that can tolerate bright, filtered light, and because they are succulents, they can go through \u2014 and want \u2014 a pretty hefty dry time.\u2019 Which makes them ideal for plant parents who go out of town a lot or might not have much direct sunlight in their homes, says Heibel. \u00a310 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nSilver-Dollar Vine \u2018The silver-dollar vine is an amazing succulent from Madagascar and has such a unique shape that we can\u2019t help but find this plant fascinating,\u2019 says Ries. It thrives in full sun but can handle some partial light, and it likes being under-watered, she adds, making it the perfect plant for anyone who has lots of windows, travels often, or is forgetful. And it\u2019s a rarer find, which also adds to its appeal. \u2018The colour of the circular leaves is this green-grey mint color that really stands out among the vibrant greens of most indoor plants.\u2019 \u00a310 at eBay UK Buy\n\nFor the somewhat-experienced plant parent\n\nStromanthe \u2018Triostar\u2019 The fun Stromanthe \u2018Triostar\u2019 is a go-to favorite of Ryan Lee, co-founder of Rooted NYC, because \u2018it\u2019s one of the plants that exhibit nyctinastic movement, which is a fancy way of saying their leaves dance up and down within a 24-hour cycle.\u2019 Plus, the magenta, cream, and forest-green coloring is striking and, as Lee simply puts it, \u2018friggin\u2019 beautiful.\u2019 The plant is pet-friendly, so its a good option for people with animals. \u00a330 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nPink-Pinstripe Calathea Similar to the Stromanthe \u2018Triostar\u2019 is the\u2018Calathea ornata, or pinstripe Calathea, a colourful member of the prayer-plant family (Marantaceae),\u2019 says Erin Marino, director of brand marketing at the Sill. It is known for \u2018both its unique colouring \u2014 leaves that are green on top with thin pink stripes and dark maroon underneath \u2014 and its unique leaf movements.\u2019 \u00a315 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nHoya carnosa Rope Plant Three of our experts recommend the Hoya, or wax plant. \u2018They\u2019re dangly, they\u2019re often romantically variegated, and some of their species grow curled, crinkled leaves,\u2019 say Gordon and Benoit. Oakes warns that because they are a fairly slow-growing plant, they do require a lot of time and patience. However, she says, \u2018they make a great houseplant because they are relatively non-fussy and easy to propagate.\u2019 Harding seconds that: \u2018They have amazing character and are super-easy to care for.\u2019 If that\u2019s not enough to convince you that the Hoya is a worthy addition to your collection, Gordon and Benoit promise that \u2018when they bloom, the flowers smell like chocolate.\u2019 \u00a38 at eBay UK Buy\n\nPink Chinese Evergreen Aglaonema, otherwise known as Chinese evergreen, has been a common houseplant for centuries, says Oakes. \u2018However, since that time, there have been quite a few introductions and different cultivated varieties that have come out on the market \u2014 many in different colour patterns, like camouflage, reds, whites, pinks, and a number of others,\u2019 she explains. Plant influencer Jamie Song calls the tricolour varieties some of the \u2018most-sought-after plants\u2019 because \u2018the leaves have a beautiful camouflage pattern, which is hard to believe exists in nature.\u2019 Oakes especially recommends it \u2018for those who can\u2019t grow flowers in their home, because Aglaonema can really give a nice brightness of colour.\u2019 \u00a320 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nPonytail Palm Bonsai \u2018I love my ponytail palm Beaucarnea recurvata. They add quirk and a sculptural sensibility to a space, and since they store water in their large trunks and enjoy being somewhat pot-bound, they are very low maintenance,\u2019 says Justina Blakeney, founder and director of the Jungalow. Because \u2018ponytail palm\u2019 is a misnomer (it isn\u2019t a palm at all and is actually more closely related to desert plants), it can thrive even under the care of the most forgetful plant parent. \u2018I like to keep a smaller one on our dining table instead of flowers, and I have been shopping for a large one to put in our living room as a focal point,\u2019 Blakeney says. \u00a332 at eBay UK Buy\n\nAlocasia \u2018Polly\u2019 The Alocasia \u2018Polly,\u2019 while not as indestructible as the snake plant, is still a relatively easy-to-care-for addition to a collection. Plus \u2018it has these striking arrowhead-shaped leaves that are green on top with thick white veins and maroon underneath,\u2019 says Marino. Because of their unique shape, they are sometimes referred to as elephant ears, she adds. They do best in bright-to-medium indirect light with biweekly waterings. Song suggests its close relative Alocasia cuprea for the \u2018stunning metallic sheen and hints of purple iridescence,\u2019 he says. \u2018Because of these unusual qualities, those in the know will want to acquire this plant.\u2019 \u00a318 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nMonstera adansonii While the typical Monstera has invaded every Instagram feed, boutique shop, and apartment over the past year, there are still plenty of worthwhile variegated varieties very few people known about or have. Chinga-Haven and Beyer love this Swiss-cheese plant because, while it \u2018is a vine version of the Monstera,\u2019 it still has the \u2018same easy care.\u2019 And the negative space created by the holes gives it a super-interesting look. \u00a311 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nDracaena marginata The dragon plant has a distinctive slender stem that erupts into a fan of leaves at the top, giving it a modern sensibility. \u2018It has a different leaf shape than the usual, comes in colour variations, and is very linear, so it\u2019s great for small apartments,\u2019 say Chinga-Haven and Beyer. It\u2019s an effective way to have a more substantial vertical plant that has an outsize visual impact without getting in the way. While Dracaena marginata is toxic to animals, it is quite easy to care for. It requires only a weekly watering and bright, indirect sunlight. \u00a312 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nPhilodendron \u2018Lickety Split\u2019 \u2018This houseplant makes a big statement because it resembles an outstretched mass of giant green hands,\u2019 say Gordon and Benoit. Plus, because the plant is still flying under the radar, you can find a good-size specimen for an affordable price (for now), which is why the pair suggest scoring one fast. \u2018Its Philodendron genus got reassigned to Thaumatophyllum only last year, so you\u2019ll probably still find it listed as a Philo. But don\u2019t dare call it a Monstera,\u2019 they warn. \u00a310 at eBay UK Buy\n\nFor the advanced plant parent\n\nDwarf Cavendish Banana Tree \u2018While the bird-of-paradise often outshines banana plants (though, funny enough, are often mistaken for them), they can often grow unmanageably tall or etiolate in most households,\u2019 says plant writer Jeannie Phan. \u2018That\u2019s why I love this dwarf variety of banana tree: It\u2019s super-compact and small-space friendly while still giving off a tropical feel with its broad leaves,\u2019 she explains. As an added bonus, the tree can actually fruit \u2018if you\u2019ve got a sunny outdoor space it can vacation to every summer.\u2019 Even a small patio or patch of backyard will do. \u00a337 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nCalathea orbifolia Horticulturist Anders R\u00f8yneberg particularly loves the Calathea orbifolia \u2018due to its unique texture and beautiful foliage\u2019 and describes it as \u2018a stunning eye-catcher.\u2019 Calatheas are tropical plants that require low-to-medium light and ample humidity to keep them happy and healthy. Chinga-Haven and Beyer note that while \u2018it is a bit more difficult to take care of with a humidifier or a spray, they should thrive.\u2019 And according to R\u00f8yneberg, the extra effort is worth it: \u2018I love it because it gives me this tropical feeling when I need it the most; in the cold and dark Norwegian winter.\u2019 \u00a319 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
