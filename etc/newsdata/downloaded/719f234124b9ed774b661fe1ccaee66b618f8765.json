(Yes, and some frustrated lawmakers are openly considering it.)\n\nWho is Gordon Sondland and why should you care about him?\n\nCan Congress continue its impeachment inquiry if the Trump administration ignores subpoenas for testimony and documents?\n\nWhat would a Senate trial look like?\n\nAre there any Republicans willing to break with Trump?\n\nI\u2019ll also be taking your impeachment questions and answering them regularly.\n\nNo question is too simple for this newsletter, or for me. I have been a politics reporter for a while now, but I\u2019m not really that far removed from my days as a Washington newcomer, or my Texas roots. I wasn\u2019t old enough to get told the non-PG-version behind Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment in the \u201990s, and I started at The Washington Post in the Trump era, where the political rules don\u2019t seem to apply as often.\n\nSo I\u2019ll be following the Trump impeachment inquiry with outside-the-Beltway sensitivities, aiming to help all of us understand what\u2019s going on and why the headlines you see in The Washington Post and elsewhere matter.\n\nJoin me every afternoon, starting Tuesday and continuing five days a week for as long as the impeachment story warrants it. I\u2019m looking forward to writing to you, and hearing what\u2019s on your mind, as this historic moment plays out.\n\nAD", "description": "The Fix's newsletter is expanding to keep up with all the impeachment news.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xrmJZPbBxEfDo8qhTCnFIFn_hDU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LRYROJ3FKVAPVHZFSOTJKPTGAY.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
