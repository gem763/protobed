First it was theories about a closure at the Strait of Hormuz. Then it was fears of an all-out war between Iran and the United States or Iran and Saudi Arabia. All those are merely possibilities, but the reality suggests that a whole different kind of extreme is far more likely: crushingly low oil prices.\n\nIn amongst the screams of geopolitical risk premium are far scarier whispers of words such as demand destruction, trade disputes, and economic climate deterioration. And those words describe the current reality in the market, and as such, suggest a similar future reality\u2014a reality where demand destruction continues to push prices down, down, down. Is $10 oil really possible?\n\nDented Demand Outlook\n\nThroughout 2019, it seems like the forecasters can\u2019t revise down their projections for oil demand fast enough.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has continued to revise downward its oil demand growth projections for 2019 and beyond.\n\nFrom the 1.4 million bpd of demand growth the IEA was projecting for 2019 back in January, their estimates have fallen to 1.1 million bpd demand growth this month. These estimates were based on actual global demand, which in May fell by 160,000 bpd year over year, according to the IEA.\n\nFor its projections of 2020 global oil demand growth, they, too, were revised downward, starting at 1.4 million bpd in their June report before falling to 1.3 million bpd in their August report. For September, the IEA is holding fast their projections for 2020 oil demand growth at 1.3 million bpd.\n\nRelated: Oil Slumps Again\u2026 Will OPEC Act?\n\nOPEC has its own demand growth projections, which also have been revised downward on a pretty regular basis this year.\n\nWhile an oil demand growth of a bit above 1 million bpd doesn\u2019t necessarily spell doom and gloom for the oil markets, the downward trend is clear, and suggests weakness going forward.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen this historically, despite the significant geopolitical events that have been specifically tied to oil. Those significant geopolitical events have moved the needle, with prices spiking at each event, but those events are now unable to sustain these higher prices. Instead, we are seeing temporary blips. This suggests that oil prices are beholden to the fundamental realities: sluggish demand paired with robust production. And all indications are that this will continue.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Trade disputes, demand destruction and continued oversupply not only suppress geopolitical risk in oil markets, they could actually lead to a sharp downturn in crude", "authors": ["Julianne Geiger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6MSoSeGCeKXlOYmd4dOQ.A--~B/aD0yNzA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/27428ff43be3a3a7d61d37f8f1ab1714", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
