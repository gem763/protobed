Elizabeth Warren was slammed by her 2020 Democratic rivals on the debate stage in Ohio on Tuesday night, after she \u2013 once again \u2013 refused to admit that taxes would have to rise on middle-class Americans under her Medicare for All vision.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy and big corporations \u2026 for hard-working middle class families, costs will go down,\u201d Warren said, when asked to respond \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d as to whether the middle class would be required to pay higher tax rates. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders weighed in, as \u201csomebody who wrote the damn bill,\u201d saying that taxes will in fact rise \u2013 as he has previously admitted \u2013 but the tax increase will be \u201csubstantially less\u201d than what most people were paying when lower health care costs are factored in.\n\nMayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, criticized Warren for refusing to answer the yes or no question, saying she had a signature plan for everything except for how to pay for Medicare for All. He also said her unwillingness to answer the question is the type of avoidance that leads to public disillusionment with politics.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar piled on to Warren, saying at least Sanders is \u201cbeing honest,\u201d adding Warren should \u201cbe honest and tell them where they are sending the invoice.\u201d\n\nBiden also said the Medicare for All costs \u2013 projected to exceed $30 trillion over the course of a decade \u2013 would be more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.\n\nSanders unveiled his updated Medicare for All bill in April, which would expand coverage of the government-run program to all Americans, not just those over the age of 65. He pushed a similar proposal in 2017.\n\nHe has estimated that taxes could rise by $10,000 for the average family. He added that a family currently paying $20,000 for private insurance \u2013 in premiums and out-of-pocket expenses \u2013 would see that obligation eliminated. Instead, taxes would increase by $10,000.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Sen.
