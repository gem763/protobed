No,\u201d a senior adviser told campaign reporters Tuesday in a background briefing. The adviser said Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest in the nation, will be \u201ccritical.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019re going to win. We think it\u2019s going to be a dogfight. \u2026 But we think there are several candidates in this field, there\u2019s probably three or four, that are going to go awhile.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Biden\u2019s campaign mentioned Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nBiden advisers have said they\u2019ve laid the groundwork in early voting states but \u201care now ramping up for Super Tuesday and beyond,\u201d and they have no expectation other top-tier candidates will leave the race after the first contests.\n\n\u201cWe feel we are going to be in a very dominant spot,\u201d after the first four early states, another adviser said.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

An adviser then mentioned that the nation\u2019s biggest swing state, Florida, is \u201calways in the mix\u201d and then mused about chances of winning in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, only to add Texas as more of an afterthought.\n\nCampaign advisers sounded a defensive note about news coverage of Biden\u2019s misstatements and gaffes as well as the \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d of the 76-year-old Biden being out of step with the party. Instead, an adviser noted, Biden has the broadest multiracial base of support and that he\u2019s most in line with Democratic voters, despite the carping heard on social media.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party is not Twitter,\u201d the adviser said.\n\n", "description": "Biden advisers say they\u2019ve laid the groundwork in early states but \u201care now ramping up for Super Tuesday and beyond.\"", "authors": ["Natasha Korecki"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a9/92/4e987019457bb028099ca45b0c3b/190903-biden-iowa-getty-773.jpg"}
