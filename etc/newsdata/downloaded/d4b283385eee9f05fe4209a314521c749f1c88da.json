Briscoe Cain tweeted, \u201cMy AR is ready for you, Robert Francis.\u201d\n\nBeto replied, telling the lawmaker \u201cThis is a death threat, Representative. Clearly, you shouldn\u2019t own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else.\u201d\n\nThis is a death threat, Representative.

We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nThe comment was met with loud applause.", "description": ".09/13/2019 14:05:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/7ce64a24-268e-4aae-b1e6-70079a6b628f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
