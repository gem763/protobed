Federer and Djokovic have left town: the Swiss spent and hurting with a bad back, the Serb forced to quit with a shoulder injury.\n\nMedvedev swats aside Dimitrov to make US Open final as sublime run goes on Read more\n\nNadal, normally the member of the Big Three most susceptible to breakdown, is still standing and looking awesome again. But his ingrained sense of caution and respect would not allow him to entertain serious thoughts about moving to within one slam of Federer, who turned 38 three weeks ago, and push three clear of Djokovic.\n\n\u201cWe are all still playing,\u201d he said of the most engaging rivalry in sport. \u201cWhen I arrived here, my goal was to produce a chance to compete for the big thing again. Here I am. I give myself another chance, as I did at Wimbledon, as I did in Australia, as I did at Roland Garros. That\u2019s the personal happiness.\n\n\u201cOf course, I would love to be the one who achieves more grand slams, but I still sleep very well without that. Sunday, it\u2019s just one more chance, that\u2019s all. My opponents are going to keep playing. You cannot be all day frustrated or thinking about what your neighbour has that\u2019s better than what you have. Be happy with yourself.\u201d\n\nNadal saved two set points in his first-set tie-break against Berrettini, and was mightily relieved to push on and win the second semi-final 7-6 (6), 6-4, 6-1. If Berrettini had pickpocketed the set, the evening might have turned into the sort of struggle that would sap the 33-year-old Nadal\u2019s reserves of energy before the final. So, instead of getting dragged into a four- or five-setter, he finished the job in under two and a half hours. Long enough to sharpen up his game, not too long to wear him out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daniil Medvedev celebrates his victory over Grigor Dimitrov in the semi-finals. \u2018I want to be a better person than I was a few days ago,\u2019 the Russian said. Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWinning the first set would have meant a lot,\u201d Berrettini said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to go a set down after an hour with him.\u201d In back-to-back majors, the world No 24 has now lost to two players with 38 slam titles between them: Federer in the fourth round at Wimbledon and Nadal here.\n\nWhen told that Berrettini described him as \u201ca beast, a machine\u201d, Nadal smiled and said: \u201cI just hope to be like this on Sunday. I will need it.\u201d Nadal, who never underestimates an opponent, said of Medvedev: \u201cHis summer is almost perfect: final in Washington [where he lost to Nick Kyrgios], final in Montreal [where Nadal beat him 6-3, 6-0], winning Cincinnati [in two sets against David Goffin after beating Djokovic in the semis], final here. He is the player who is in the best shape on tour. I will face the player who is winning more matches than anyone else this year [44 of 60], the player who is playing at the highest level.\n\n\u201cIt is a super-tough final. I need to be playing at my best. At the end of the match, I increased my level again. I need to hold this level if I want to have chances on Sunday. If not, is so difficult. He is very, very solid.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nThe lanky Russian\u2019s five career titles have all arrived this year, along with more than half of his $6m career earnings. In New York over the past fortnight, he has moved from anonymity to star, winding up the crowd, who booed him then loved him; the self-styled new bad boy of tennis. But he can play.\n\nLike Berrettini with Nadal, Grigor Dimitrov also took Medvedev to a tie-break then faded over two hours and 38 minutes, although he competed well in the first set after dropping the opening service game to love. Medvedev, like Nadal, remained rock-steady all the way.\n\nAs for his new persona, Medvedev laughed and then got serious, and said: \u201cI want to be a better person than I was a few days ago.\u201d\n\nThis is business. If he is a better player than a few days before, he is more than capable of putting Nadal\u2019s charge at the majors mountain on hold.", "description": "Victory in the US Open final would put the Spaniard just one major title behind his great rival Roger Federer", "authors": ["Kevin Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209ccd3f97d92efb4a552b52b683f807ba32b155/169_246_3948_2369/master/3948.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=80de418a19c457fc5c933f2b9baffbdd", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
