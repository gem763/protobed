(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nby Jesse Dougherty\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 It was a fastball that ran right into his bat, the kind of pitch you dream about in the backyard growing up, with the bases juiced and everything riding on whatever happens next. So Howie Kendrick used it to make Washington baseball history. He used it to hit a grand slam, shattering a tie in the 10th inning at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday night, sending the Washington Nationals deeper into October than they\u2019ve ever been before. That\u2019s what he did.\n\nIt came at 9:23 p.m. in Los Angeles, on the ninth night of October, marking the exact moment that pushed the Nationals past the first round of the postseason. Finally. They beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 7-3, in Game 5 of the National League Division Series, and this is what an exorcism looks like on a baseball field: Four players trotting slowly around the bases while Joe Kelly shook his head on the mound. Their teammates spilling onto the dugout, stumbling onto the dirt, smiling and screaming and soon smacking Kendrick on the back once he crossed the plate. Then Kendrick hugging Manager Dave Martinez, his helmet torn off his bald head, his fists clenched and his shoulders shaking because this run wasn\u2019t going to end like all the others.\n\nAnd there was later that final sound, an eerie quiet inside Dodger Stadium, ushering the Nationals into a cramped clubhouse that they\u2019d soak with champagne and beer. The offense did little against Dodgers starter Walker Buehler for 6 \u2154 innings. Then came back-to-back homers for Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto off Clayton Kershaw in the eighth, tying the game in two pitches, only setting up Kendrick to change, well, everything with one swing.\n\n[Clayton Kershaw, of all people, let the Nationals back into Game 5]\n\n\n\nJuan Soto tied the game in the eighth. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nHistory wasn\u2019t on the Nationals\u2019 side until the end, even after momentum flipped, even after Rendon and Soto made it okay to believe that this year could offer a new script. It never is once the calendar flips to autumn. The Nationals had been to the playoffs in four of the last eight years \u2014 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017 \u2014 but never punched past the division series. Three of those defeats came in a do-or-die Game 5. Each one built the narrative that this club shrinks whenever the stakes grow.\n\nBut this year was different. The Nationals weren\u2019t favored against the 106-win Dodgers. They had house money and Stephen Strasburg on the mound. They\u2019ve had to win for months now, or so they believed, ever since they sunk to 19-31 and chose to fight instead of fold.\n\n\u201cWe have been through this since May 24,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said Wednesday afternoon, nodding to the lowest point of the regular season, knowing full well that nothing\u2019s like facing elimination on the road. \u201cWe have been playing playoff games since May 24.\u201d\n\n[Boswell: Howie Kendrick keeps the party going, and the Nats are dancing into the NLCS]\n\nStrasburg was the key at the beginning. He entered with a 0.64 ERA in 28 postseason innings. He lifted the Nationals here by throwing three scoreless in the wild-card game, then was dominant in a Game 2 win on this field. He, along with Scherzer, was why the Nationals ever pushed the Dodgers to the brink.\n\nBut he wilted, if only a bit, when the Nationals most needed him to be flaw-free. His third pitch was smacked by Joc Pederson for a double off the wall. His eighth pitch was crushed by Max Muncy, who crushed the Nationals all series, for a two-run homer. His 24th was rocked by Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, this one a solo shot, and Hern\u00e1ndez revved the crowd while rounding third.\n\nAnd Strasburg stood in front of the mound, his stare blank, his glove frozen in the air as it waited for a new baseball. He couldn\u2019t locate his curveball. That allowed the Dodgers to sit and feast on his diminished heat. Strasburg did settle in, blanking the Dodgers from the third inning to the sixth, and the Nationals inched onto the scoreboard when Soto singled in Rendon in the sixth.\n\nStrasburg, Tanner Rainey and Patrick Corbin then held the two-run deficit in place. Buehler walked Trea Turner on his 117th and final pitch to put the tying run on base in the seventh. But Kershaw needed just three pitches to discard Eaton and end the threat. Then Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts kept Kershaw in. Then Rendon took Kershaw deep to lead off the eighth. Then Soto followed with a bigger blast that knotted the score.\n\nSoto fanned his arms out as he rounded first, looking like a human airplane, lurching his teammates awake with one swing of his bat. The ballpark settled into a hush. The faint noise was Kershaw being booed off the field. But Kenta Maeda struck out the next three batters he faced, settling the danger, but the Dodgers didn\u2019t use it as a springboard ahead. Corbin turned in a disastrous relief appearance in a Game 3 loss. He followed it by recording four outs to keep the game tied. Daniel Hudson followed with three more outs to force extra innings.\n\n[Svrluga: For heroic Nationals, ghosts of playoffs past are busted in Game 5]\n\nThat\u2019s when the Nationals\u2019 lineup really clicked. Adam Eaton worked a full-count walk against the erratic Kelly. Rendon smacked a double. The Dodgers intentionally walked Soto, bringing Kendrick up, and that\u2019s when the 36-year-old went 410 feet over the center field fence. He had had a rough series to that point. He had three errors. He grounded into a double play to kill a rally in the sixth on Wednesday night. But baseball has a way of offering another chance.\n\nThese Nationals know that better than anyone. They learned it when they turned their season around in late May. They learned it when they were four outs away from losing the wild-card game last week. And they learned it again right here, in the exact kind of night that has always slipped away from them, but tilted in their favor because Kendrick had the decisive swing.\n\nNow they head to St. Louis to play the Cardinals to see what magic may be left. Now they\u2019ll test their fate all over again.\n\nInning-by-inning recap\n\nby Sam Fortier\n\nTenth inning (Nationals 7, Dodgers 3):\n\nHowie Kendrick delivered the greatest hit in Nationals history in the 10th inning. His teammates set it up \u2014 Adam Eaton walk, Anthony Rendon double, Juan Soto intentional walk \u2014 and he brought them all the to plate. Kendrick faced Joe Kelly, in his second inning of relief for the Dodgers, and blasted a 97-mph fastball which caught just a little too much of the plate over the wall in center. Kendrick single-handedly pushed this team as close as its ever been to where it\u2019s never gone before: the National League Championship Series. Sean Doolittle secured three more outs.\n\nNinth inning (Dodgers 3, Nationals 3):\n\nDave Roberts turned over the ninth to Joe Kelly, the Dodgers\u2019 erratic reliever with a 4.56 ERA who nearly let the Nationals back into Game 3. If this decision was reverse thinking from his Clayton Kershaw approach, it paid off. Kelly struck out the first two hitters and got Trea Turner to fly out to right.\n\nDave Martinez went to Daniel Hudson for the most important inning of the Nationals season. The right-hander acquired at the trade deadline for moments just like this delivered. He had traffic (Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez singled with one out), and he had scares (Will Smith\u2019s flyball to the warning track in right). But he held the line (Chris Taylor lined out center).\n\nEighth inning (Dodgers 3, Nationals 3):\n\nThe Nationals aren\u2019t done yet. Anthony Rendon homered off Clayton Kershaw to lead off the eighth inning. Juan Soto took the next pitch back-to-back and the 2019 Nationals continued doing the least likely things at the least likely moments.\n\nJuan Soto is 20 years old.\n\nJuan Soto is left-handed.\n\nJuan Soto just homered off Clayton Kershaw...\n\n\n\n...down by 1 in the 8th inning of a do-or-die Game 5 on the road at Dodger Stadium.#ChildishBambino // #STAYINTHEFIGHT pic.twitter.com/0zyvNp2GgE \u2014 Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 10, 2019\n\nIf he looks like an MVP...\n\nIf he sounds like an MVP...\n\nIf he hits clutch HRs like an MVP...\n\n\n\n...then he's probably an MVP.#BeatLA // #STAYINTHEFIGHT pic.twitter.com/qh81FFN1Th \u2014 Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 10, 2019\n\nDANCING WITH THE NATS pic.twitter.com/0H8MEjcHNN \u2014 Rudy Gersten (@DCBarno) October 10, 2019\n\nThe dagger for Dodgers fans: Dave Roberts left Kenta Maeda and the right-hander\u2019s ridiculous splits against right-handed hitters in the bullpen. Roberts finally went to Maeda after Kershaw\u2019s second homer. Maeda carved up the Nationals for three strikeouts, all on sliders.\n\nPatrick Corbin hit Justin Turner to put a runner on but limited the threat there. He struck out Cody Bellinger and pinch-hitter David Freese to escape the eighth with the tie intact, something he couldn\u2019t do in Game 3. The question now is how long Corbin can go (if Manager Dave Martinez wants him to pitch the ninth). He threw 35 pitches in Game 3 on Sunday. It\u2019s unclear if he has many more than the 22 he\u2019s already thrown. The Nationals would like to go to one of their top relievers, Sean Doolittle or Daniel Hudson, with a lead in the ninth, but that is up to the team\u2019s bats.\n\nSeventh inning (Dodgers 3, Nationals 1):\n\nThe Nationals had what was their best chance yet. It was painful \u2014 a ball hit Kurt Suzuki, ricocheted off his face and forced him to leave the game \u2014 but Trea Turner later worked a walk and finally forced Walker Buehler from the game. The young, right-handed starter departed with two on and two out in the top of the seventh having thrown 117 pitches. The Dodgers replaced him with future Hall-of-Famer Clayton Kershaw, who struck out Adam Eaton on three pitches.\n\nDave Martinez gambled in the seventh. The first pitcher he went to out of the bullpen was right-hander Tanner Rainey, not one of the three relievers who\u2019d pitch in an ideal scenario (Patrick Corbin, Sean Doolittle or Daniel Hudson). The bet paid off; Rainey retired the only two batters he faced, both right-handers, and then Martinez went to the left-handed Corbin for the top of the Dodgers lineup. Corbin struck out Joc Pederson. The Nationals have six outs to go.\n\nSixth inning (Dodgers 3, Nationals 1):\n\nThe Nationals lineup finally broke through in its third chance against Walker Buehler. Anthony Rendon led off with a double and Juan Soto drove him in with a single. They snapped Buehler\u2019s scoreless postseason innings streak at 21 2/3, and the Nationals dugout was amped. Unfortunately for them, Howie Kendrick grounded into a killer double play and, when Ryan Zimmerman struck out, the second straight inning with a real chance was left unrealized to its full potential.\n\nAnthony Rendon does an Anthony Rendon thing.\n\n\n\nJuan Soto brings him home.\n\n\n\nBOTTOM 6 // Dodgers 3, Nats 1 pic.twitter.com/rG9enKJLcX \u2014 Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 10, 2019\n\nStephen Strasburg allowed a leadoff double, but he didn\u2019t allow it to hurt him any further. He struck out Matt Beaty (on a change-up), Corey Seager (on a curveball) and Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez (on a change-up) to end his empty-the-tank inning. The Nationals bullpen is on deck.\n\nFifth inning (Dodgers 3, Nationals 0):\n\nDave Martinez had a difficult choice in the fifth. He had his starter, Stephen Strasburg, finally looking like himself but due up third. Kurt Suzuki led off with a walk and Michael A. Taylor singled, setting up the manager\u2019s most difficult choice of the night. Martinez let Strasburg hit for himself and he fouled off a bunt with strike three. The Nationals failed to drive in Suzuki and Taylor and, when you look back, that might be Strasburg\u2019s most significant strikeout of the season.\n\nStephen Strasburg sailed through the fifth inning, retiring the Dodgers in order. He\u2019s almost mirrored Max Scherzer\u2019s wild-card game with five innings and the way the Dodgers scored those three runs (two-run homer to the No. 2 hitter, leadoff homer in the second). The difference in that game was the Nationals offense coming alive late. The question is whether they can replicate that magic tonight.\n\nFourth inning (Dodgers 3, Nationals 0):\n\nThe Nationals looked like they got the break they needed on a defensive miscue by the Dodgers. Then the Nationals got robbed of the second break they needed on an unreal defensive play by the Dodgers. After Juan Soto reached second on a fielding error by Corey Seager, Howie Kendrick hit a line drive to center which looked destined for extra bases. Instead, Gold Glove-caliber center fielder Cody Bellinger made a leaping catch and tamped down a possible Nationals rally. It was the story of the Nationals offense so far.\n\nSpoiler alert: He caught it. pic.twitter.com/HSYpk9toeO \u2014 Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) October 10, 2019\n\nStephen Strasburg finally started to capture his curveball command, but the question is whether it\u2019s too late. The right-hander struck out Will Smith and Walker Buehler with the pitch, but he jogged back to the dugout with his team trailing 3-0. The onus is now not on him as much as it is on the bats.\n\nThird inning (Dodgers 3, Nationals 0):\n\nThe Nationals squandered Walker Buehler\u2019s walk of Stephen Strasburg and they failed to advance a runner past first for the second straight inning. One of the biggest talking points after Game 1 was the Nationals expanding the strike zone and chasing pitches. That doesn\u2019t appear to be the case this time, as they\u2019ve mostly stayed in the zone except Adam Eaton\u2019s groundout in the first or Trea Turner\u2019s fielder\u2019s choice in the third.\n\nEven when Stephen Strasburg escapes an inning unscathed, it\u2019s hard. Howie Kendrick made his third error of the series when he booted an easy groundball from Cody Bellinger to let the NL MVP candidate to reach first. That didn\u2019t ultimately hurt, Strasburg stranded him at third, but it did extend the starter\u2019s frame and made him throw additional pitches.\n\nSecond inning (Dodgers 3, Nationals 0):\n\nThe Nationals couldn\u2019t do much against Walker Buehler in the second, managing a Ryan Zimmerman single and not much else. Kurt Suzuki grounded out to third and pushed the offensive contributions from the Nationals catching position this postseason to 0 for 16 with six strikeouts and three walks.\n\nStephen Strasburg cannot locate his curveball, so the Dodgers are waiting it out and sitting heat. That\u2019s how Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez hit the game\u2019s second home run. He watched a change-up flyball in the dirt and then crushed a dead shot to center field on a 94-mph fastball which sat in the middle of the zone. The only encouraging stat for the Nationals was that Max Scherzer did the exact same thing in the wild-card game (two-run homer to the No. 2 hitter, solo homer to lead off the second). The Nationals\u2019 offense, though, needs to flip the script earlier than they did against the Milwaukee Brewers to have any sort of chance.\n\nFirst inning (Dodgers 2, Nationals 0):\n\nThe Nationals couldn\u2019t get anything going in the first inning of a win-or-home Game 5. Trea Turner struck out, Adam Eaton grounded out, Anthony Rendon flied out to the warning track. It wasn\u2019t productive, but it wasn\u2019t expanding the zone and helping Walker Buehler as they did in Game 1.\n\nGame 5 started as weird as anyone who\u2019s ever watched the Nationals play in one might expect. Joc Pederson hit an opposite field double which at first looked like a home run because it bounced into the bullpen, but on review it actually hit the mesh netting of the bullpen door and bounced through. The next hitter, Max Muncy, left no doubt. He crushed a two-run homer to right-center for Stephen Strasburg\u2019s first postseason home run allowed of his career.\n\nCLUTCH LEVEL ON MAX. pic.twitter.com/bjBsQhFZqg \u2014 Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) October 10, 2019\n\nStrasburg, for his part, looked off. He struggled to locate his off-speed stuff and, perhaps anticipating the Dodgers adjusting to his curveball (which he threw 40 percent of the time in Game 1), he relied on his fastball. It didn\u2019t pan out as he allowed the double and the home run \u2014 and a walk and a single \u2014 in a rocky first inning. He did not look at his best.\n\nPregame:\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals are waiting. The Red Birds exploded in a 10-run first inning, and they never looked back in a 13-1 victory over the NL East-champion Atlanta Braves which secured them a spot in the National League Championship Series. Now, the Cardinals wait to see the winner of the late game, the Washington Nationals and the Los Angeles Dodgers, in their own crucial Game 5. If the Dodgers win, the Cardinals fly to the west coast for Game 1 on Friday; if the Nationals win, they fly to St. Louis.\n\n[The Cardinals\u2019 10-run first inning left them with an interesting choice against the Braves]\n\nThe Nationals hope they\u2019re flying to St. Louis on Thursday morning because, if they beat the Dodgers, the Cardinals would give them another chance to exorcise playoffs demons.
