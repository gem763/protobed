There's less support for a ban on sales of military-style assault weapons but a majority nevertheless: 56 percent of respondents support a federal ban on assault weapons, along with a mandatory federal buyback program.\n\nAs Congress comes back to Washington under renewed pressure to act after 53 people were killed in mass shootings in August alone, more Americans say they trust congressional Democrats over Trump to handle the nation\u2019s gun laws:\n\nBy a 51 to 36 percent margin, respondents trust congressional Democrats over Trump on the issue \u2014 with independents siding with Democrats by a 17-point margin.\n\nIt's \u201ca divide that could have political ramifications for the 2020 presidential and congressional elections,\u201d per Mike and Emily.\n\nThe overwhelming public support for gun control belies Trump's inconsistency and Congress's inaction on the issue:\n\nOn the Hill: Congress is sitting on two bills the House passed this past February to expand background checks that Trump previously vowed to veto.\n\nCongress is sitting on two bills the House passed this past February to expand background checks that Trump previously vowed to veto. Trump himself has wavered on tougher gun laws: He previously capitulated to NRA pressure after the Parkland, Fla., shooting and many remain pessimistic that he'll follow through on endorsing extensive background checks, despite some public support for them.\n\nHe previously capitulated to NRA pressure after the Parkland, Fla., shooting and many remain pessimistic that he'll follow through on endorsing extensive background checks, despite some public support for them. It's in Trump's court: \u201cIf the president is in favor \u2026 and I know that if we pass it\u2019ll become law \u2026 I\u2019ll put it on the floor.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Sept. 3.\n\n\u201cIf the president is in favor \u2026 and I know that if we pass it\u2019ll become law \u2026 I\u2019ll put it on the floor.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Sept. 3. More: \"The president needs to step up here and set some guidelines for what he would do,\" Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said yesterday on \"Meet the Press. \"I'm afraid what's going happen here is what always happens is we take this silly \"if we don't get everything, we won't do anything\" and fail to do the things we could do with more early mental health help ... \"\n\nTHE GENDER DIVIDE: There's another political pitfall Trump risks in the face of inaction on the gun issue going into 2020. The Post-ABC poll finds a stark gender divide on support for tougher gun laws.\n\n\u201cMore than two-thirds of women say they are worried about a mass shooting in their community, compared to just over half of men. And women are 20 points more likely to be confident than men that passing stricter gun control laws would reduce mass shootings,\u201d per Mike and Emily.\n\nDistrust for Trump: By a margin of 59 to 28 percent, women are more likely to trust Democrats in Congress over Trump to handle the issue.\n\nBy a margin of 59 to 28 percent, women are more likely to trust Democrats in Congress over Trump to handle the issue. \u201cDemocrats understand that gun safety is America\u2019s new kitchen-table political issue, and this is something that you would not have seen just a few years ago,\u201d Peter Ambler, executive director of the gun-safety advocacy group Giffords told Mike and Emily.\n\nPeter Ambler, executive director of the gun-safety advocacy group Giffords told Mike and Emily. Even some moderate Democrats who flipped Republican districts have joined calls for tighter laws: \u201cI don\u2019t really see any reason for ordinary citizens to own weapons of war,\u201d Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) said of her support for reimposing an assault weapons ban.\n\nLOOKING AHEAD: \u201cThe House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing Sept. 25 on [a version of the assault weapons ban] \u2014 a significant step for Democratic leaders who have long treated an assault weapons ban as too politically risky,\u201d per Mike and Emily.\n\nJudiciary is also expected \u201cto advance a proposed federal ban on high-capacity magazines and a third bill that would bar people convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes from being eligible to purchase firearms \u2014 measures that go beyond the party\u2019s previous comfort zone.\u201d\n\nOn The Hill\n\nWhat can Congress actually get done before the year ends? No, seriously. To find out, we asked our colleague Mike DeBonis.\n\nIn the order of likelihood of passage, here's what Mike think will happen. You should also check out Mike and Rachael Bade's preview.\n\n\u201cAnti-robocall legislation: The House and Senate have passed separate bills this year aimed at tackling the robocall epidemic, and the key players in both parties have said they want to move quickly this fall to reconcile differences and pass something into law. Virtually every member of Congress would love to do something to end this constituent-irritating scourge.\n\nThe House and Senate have passed separate bills this year aimed at tackling the robocall epidemic, and the key players in both parties have said they want to move quickly this fall to reconcile differences and pass something into law. Virtually every member of Congress would love to do something to end this constituent-irritating scourge. \u201cBudget deals: The big budget deal that got done in July was a big deal mainly because it smoothed the path for passing actual spending bills \u2014 thus avoiding the prospect of a long 'continuing resolution' that would keep this year's spending levels in place for 2020. Now Congress (mainly the Senate, which hasn't yet put a single 2020 appropriations bill on the floor) has to get off their duffs and actually write the bills. Expect a short-term CR ahead of the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, setting up passage of bills in the weeks before Christmas.\n\nThe big budget deal that got done in July was a big deal mainly because it smoothed the path for passing actual spending bills \u2014 thus avoiding the prospect of a long 'continuing resolution' that would keep this year's spending levels in place for 2020.

The resolution would allow the committee to take special steps that it would not do in a regular hearing.\n\n\u201cThe vote, which is expected to occur on Wednesday, will lay out the ground rules for conducting hearings now that the committee has publicly announced it is considering recommending articles of impeachment against Trump,\u201d Raju and Herb write. The resolution would allow the committee to take special steps that it would not do in a regular hearing. The New York Times's Nick Fandos obtained a copy of the draft resolution to formalize procedures for an impeachment inquiry: \"Though the committee has already informed federal courts and the public that it is in the midst of a full-scale impeachment inquiry, the three-page resolution will be the first time lawmakers have recorded a vote to that effect. Committee leaders hope the move will send a signal to Congress and the White House that their investigation is not only proceeding but intensifying, even as the broader Democratic Party caucus remains divided over the merits of ultimately voting to impeach Mr. Trump.\"\n\nRemember: As many as 134 House Democrats, well over a majority of the caucus, support opening an impeachment inquiry, according to our colleagues' latest count. This includes a majority of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nPossible fodder for future probes: \u201cThe U.S. Air Force has ordered a world-wide review of how it chooses overnight accommodations on long flights following revelations that air crews had occasionally stayed at President Donald Trump's Scotland resort while refueling at a small commercial airport nearby,\u201d Politico\u2019s Bryan Bender and Natasha Bertrand scooped last night. This is after the House Oversight Committee announced it was investigating Vice President Pence\u2019s decision to stay at the resort.\n\nThe Campaign\n\nTHE DEM DEBATE MATCHUP DECADES IN THE MAKING: \u201cYou gave me hell,\u201d then-Vice President Biden joked to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) in 2012 as he was swearing her in. The pair have yet to debate on the same night as they both seek the White House this year, but that changes this Thursday.\n\nOur colleagues Annie Linskey and Matt Viser wrote an incredible recap of their relationship, including their fierce disagreement over bankruptcy legislation in the late '90s and early 2000s along with Warren\u2019s lonely fight against legislation that contained Biden\u2019s cancer Moonshot initiative.\n\nElsewhere in the race: It\u2019s Biden (29%), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (19%), Warren (18%) and then everybody else, according to the latest Post-ABC News poll. The next closest candidate is Sen. Kamala Harris at 7%.
