In theory, bilateral charging would allow users to charge accessories like Airpods or Apple Watch using their iPhone. All they would need to do is rest an accessory on the back of their smartphone, charging it wirelessly.\n\nIf iPhones do have the hardware capacity for bilateral charging that's currently disabled by software, Apple could theoretically roll out the feature with an iOS update in the future, enabling it on devices overnight.\n\nIn April, reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo correctly reported that the new smartphones would include a larger batter, which Kuo said could allow for bilateral charging. Apple touted the strength of the new batteries during its keynote Tuesday but did not make any indication that they are capable of bilateral charging.\n\nThe new lineup of iPhones includes another design tweak that some see as a clue about bilateral charging: the Apple logo on the back of the three new phones is centered halfway down the phone, while past models featured the Apple logo on the phones' upper half. Some have speculated that the new location of the Apple logo is meant to signal to users where to place accessories for wireless charging.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "The iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Max may include hardware capable of two-way charging that's simply been disabled by Apple until it's ready.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ba2cd2e22af0bc944f3c2-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
