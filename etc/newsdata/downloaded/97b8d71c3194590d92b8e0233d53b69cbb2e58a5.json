With this, we have seen improvements in traceability rules and in the monitoring control and surveillance tools and also in the way that the fleet is managed,\u201d Vella said.\n\nStanding alongsde him at the news conference in Brussels was Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister who said his country was now committed to ending overfishing.\n\n\u201cToday, Thailand has successfully elevated its commercial fisheries sector both in internal waters and in international waters to the international standards. We are ready to partner with the EU in promoting sustainable fisheries at both national and regional level. Thailand has a strong determination to eradicate IUU fishing,\u201d Chatchai Sarikulya said.\n\nBut other countries remain at a yellow card status and some, such as Thailand's neighbour Cambodia, even remain at a red card status:", "description": "Thailand has begun intercepting and inspecting fishing boats far out at sea this year, one of many new measures to curb its dangerously high levels of overfishing.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/57/89/46/1000x563_cmsv2_02f5abb9-9890-5451-b72f-699496fe027b-3578946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-08"}
