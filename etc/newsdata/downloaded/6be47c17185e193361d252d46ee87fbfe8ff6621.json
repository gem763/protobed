Biden, the current Democratic presidential front-runner, who urged then-President George H.W. Bush in 1992 not to fill a would-be vacancy on the Supreme Court ahead of that year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was nothing I did that would not have been done had the shoe been on the other foot had there been a \u2026 Republican president and a Democratic Senate,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday. \u201cSo look, they can whine about this all day long, but under the Constitution there is co-responsibility for appointments \u2014 the president makes the nomination and the Senate confirms. We are partners in the personnel business, up to and including the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate ultimately did confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court picks, after Republicans voted to change the rules in 2017 to allow for a simple majority to thwart potential filibusters of nominees to the Supreme Court, instead of a 60-vote threshold.\n\n\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Democrats had muscled through changes in 2013 to reduce the filibuster threshold for most presidential nominees from 60 votes to a simple majority.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
