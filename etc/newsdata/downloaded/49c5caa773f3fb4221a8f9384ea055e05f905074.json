You need to have a little more taste,\" she told the outlet he said to her. \"People are never going to take you serious as a songwriter and singer.\"\n\nHowever, she decided to march to the beat of her own drum.\n\n\"I said, 'You know what? I can't separate the two. This is who I am,'\" she told Elle. \"I not only didn't tone it down, I figured if my work was truly good enough, people would eventually recognize that.\"\n\nShe said what remained most important to her was \"knowing who I was, being happy with me, and feeling comfortable in the way I presented myself.\"\n\n\"If I was happy, I could make other people happy,\" she shared. \"That's how I've always looked at it: that I look totally artificial, but I am totally real, as a writer, as a professional, as a human being. A rhinestone shines just as good as a diamond.\"", "description": "Parton suggested these two actresses could play her if a movie is ever made about her life.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/dolly-gty-er-191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
