But those minutes drop a ton of details about how the future has been screwed up by climate change, from the eroding, watery ground of Montauk to Joanie\u2019s pregnant boss Lane snacking on crickets (and not loving Joanie\u2019s caustic joke about the \u201ccarbon bomb in her belly\u201d). We don\u2019t get a time stamp on how far into the future Joanie\u2019s story line takes place (the continued vague reference to \u201cdecades\u201d is probably going to drive me up the wall by the end of the season). However, following the reveal of her identity last week, it is nice to see her get her own title card, as well as an immediate answer to the question of \u201cwhat happened after she took those pills?\u201d\n\nNot a lot actually happens in this section, though, beyond Joanie throwing up into a smart toilet (not a piece of technology I will ever feel the need to acquire), meeting with Lane about her ongoing work as a coastal engineer (a field which lends itself to arguably too many instances of \u201cplanned obsolescence\u201d), and then making the trip to Montauk to arrive at the seemingly abandoned Lockhart family home. (\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Joanie says about staying at \u201cDad\u2019s place,\u201d but that feels like a lie.) But while it\u2019s a bit frustrating, the way in which this story is being parceled out so far means that nearly every moment contains an interesting clue or fact that proves fascinating to parse. That includes not just the fate of the world, but the events that have led Joanie to her current state of being.\n\nMeanwhile, the episode begins with another first for Janelle, the second person of color to get her own POV in the show\u2019s history (preceded only by Vik in season four). It\u2019s to their credit that writers Katie Robbins and Jaqu\u00e9n Castellanos and director Colin Bucksey let Sanaa Lathan reveal Janelle\u2019s unique charms, insecurities, and anger, all rooted in the fact that a black woman has a very different perspective on the world than a white man.\n\nWhile in the season premiere, Noah and Helen\u2019s perspectives on Vik\u2019s funeral do not recall the attendees uniformly wearing the traditional Hindu color of mourning, Janelle sees nothing but blinding white as she looks around the ceremony. Not only is it a choice that captures the universal embarrassment that comes when you arrive anywhere in a very wrong outfit, but it also plays into Janelle\u2019s extreme discomfort over being the only visible black person in attendance \u2014 and then doubly exacerbated by Bruce and Helen\u2019s casual racism at the wake.\n\nCombined with her basically being demoted by her bosses, asked to serve as \u201cco-principal\u201d with the young, white, and annoying Joel, it\u2019s a pretty bad day, and even though (at least as she tells it) Noah tries to get in touch with her to apologize, she instead turns to ex-husband Carl for first advice, then eventually comfort and reconciliation.\n\nOne of the episode\u2019s highlights is the long, playlike scene between Janelle and Carl (always one of this show\u2019s specialties), as Lathan and Russell Hornsby both bring subtle touches to their performances that make the full journey \u2014 from anger to conciliation to fondness to empowerment to doin\u2019 it \u2014 real and believable. One of the most wondrous magic tricks great actors can achieve is creating an onscreen relationship between two characters that feels like it has decades of history to it, even if offscreen the actors themselves are relative strangers. Lathan and Hornsby of course worked together in season four, but the strength of this scene has me hoping that the reunion between these two characters doesn\u2019t mean the end of their journey on this show.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s time for yet another time jump (one executed with a blunt \u201cThree Months Later\u201d title card, followed by the transition to Helen\u2019s section of the story). Production of the Descent film adaptation is now in full swing, and Helen and Whitney have dropped by the set to watch them film perhaps one of the most awkward scenes possible: \u201cEllen\u201d confronting \u201cDaniel\u201d as she discovers a bra that\u2019s not hers in their bedroom. Helen\u2019s in a near stupor over her grief, but when pressed to offer up her feedback on the scene, her advice is to make Ellen \u201cmore of a bitch,\u201d so that the ostensible hero is more likable. Given that one of The Affair\u2019s biggest flaws has been the way it tends to be overly sympathetic to Noah (despite Noah kinda being a crappy person), it\u2019s hard not to enjoy that meta-commentary, even while Noah meekly acknowledges that Daniel might be more of an anti-hero than a hero.\n\nLast week brought a taste of the movie star embodying Noah\u2019s onscreen alter ego, but this week, in both his brief interaction with Janelle at the beginning of the episode (including his shock that Janelle doesn\u2019t recognize him) and his extended afternoon with Helen, we get to know Sasha Mann a whole lot better. At least once during this episode, someone calls Sasha \u201cthe perfect man,\u201d and honestly, after he invites Helen over to his fancy, empty beach house for green tea, basketball, and tears, it\u2019s easy to see their point, even if Buddhist philosophy, taking a basketball to the face, and vomiting aren\u2019t necessarily the ingredients for a dream date.\n\nAs weird as the experience might be, Helen is finally able to watch Vik\u2019s final video message to her once she gets home, and when he tells her to enjoy her life and live for the both of them, she actually seems ready to do it. It\u2019s the biggest sign of real change and progress across the entire episode, which features plenty of high points, but could move the football a lot further down the field.\n\nThere Is No Objective Truth (Just Bullet Points):\n\nIt\u2019s a bit surprising that Janelle has never really met Noah\u2019s family, as it seems like they\u2019ve been dating for several months. Then again, it\u2019s not like anyone in his family really likes him all that much.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen Fun Home, fix that if you can. A simply beautiful modern musical, as spotlighted by Trevor\u2019s production. Like Whitney, I was in tears.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s so awesome that you\u2019re my dad\u2019s girlfriend. Dating a woman of color is one of the coolest things he\u2019s ever done.\u201d Whitney is surprisingly bearable (at least, in comparison to past exposure) during Helen\u2019s section \u2014 her genuine empathy for what Helen\u2019s been through, and what she\u2019s protected her children from, was lovely. But it\u2019s not shocking that during Janelle\u2019s brief exposure to the oldest Solloway child, Whitney managed to be annoying in her own special way.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly important, but I do wonder if the movie is going to stick with the title of Descent; a funny plot point down the line would be the director, or Sasha, trying to come up with something \u201cpunchier.\u201d\n\nNoah didn\u2019t need to laugh quite so hard at the fact that Janelle didn\u2019t recognize Sasha, even if he was more laughing at Sasha\u2019s dismay than Janelle\u2019s ignorance. Dude, lady works hard and was a single mom for years. There\u2019s no reason for her to be a loyal Us Weekly reader.\n\nLast week, there were two very different pictures of Vik on display at the funeral, depending on who you asked: Noah remembering him as the patrician and professional doctor, while Helen\u2019s version featured a casual and happy photo of her partner. Janelle, meanwhile, remembers an unsmiling portrait of Vik in a suit \u2014 she didn\u2019t know the man at all after all.", "description": "Joanie and Janelle bring us new points of view on the future and present, respectively, and both look pretty grim.
