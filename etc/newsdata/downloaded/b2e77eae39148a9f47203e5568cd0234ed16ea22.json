She guards Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and supports the gays. Thank you!\u201d he said, carrying a sign that read \u201conly vote for Tsai Ing-wen in 2020\u201d, a reference to January\u2019s presidential election.\n\nSame-sex marriage remains illegal in Taiwan\u2019s giant neighbour China, which claims Taiwan as its sacred territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under Beijing\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cTaiwan is an independent country with an advanced civil society and a liberal environment. That\u2019s completely different from China,\u201d said Peng Yuhao, a 24-year-old sales representative.\n\nA small group shouted their support for anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which have roiled the former British colony for the last four months.\n\n\u201cTaiwan\u2019s democracy supports homosexuals. Taiwan\u2019s homosexuals support Hong Kong,\u201d a group of about 50 people chanted.\n\nStill, same-sex marriage has not had an easy ride in Taiwan.\n\nLate last year, Taiwanese voters opposed same-sex marriage in a series of referendums, defining marriage as being between a man and a woman in civil law.", "description": "More than 100,000 people thronged the streets of Taiwan's capital Taipei on Saturday for East Asia's largest Pride march, months after the self-ruled island began formally allowing same-sex marriage, the first place in Asia to do so.", "authors": ["Yimou Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
