It\u2019s that Latin American peasants seem uniquely amenable to idiotic socialist schemes.\n\nYou probably think it\u2019s beyond silliness for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to keep promising FREE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL! NO PREMIUMS! NO CO-PAYS! ILLEGAL ALIENS, TOO! EVERYBODY GETS A PONY!\n\nNo one could be gullible enough to fall for that.\n\nI refer you to the economic powerhouse that is Latin America.\n\nBased on hundreds of years of indigenous people voting for politicians who made similar promises, Latin America has become the dream factory that it is today. That\u2019s why Tegucigalpa is practically a byword for \u201ctechnological innovation,\u201d Santiago was the picture of calm sophistication this weekend, and Caracas is the ultimate in modern conveniences.\n\nPerhaps you missed the article in last Saturday\u2019s New York Times on what socialism has done for the water system in Venezuela:\n\nThe brick shack on the outskirts of Venezuela\u2019s capital is crowded with tubs, jugs and buckets. The water they hold must last the family of eight for a week \u2014 but it\u2019s not enough for frequent washing or flushing, so the kitchen is filled with greasy pots and the house smells of stale urine. And none of the water is treated, making diarrhea and vomit a regular occurrence. \u201cWe practically live in the bathroom,\u201d said the mother of the family \u2026 [Her daughter] sat nearby, pale and listless, recovering from her latest bout of diarrhea just one month away from childbirth.\n\nDemocrats: We need some of that Latin American magic!\n\nTwenty years ago, 60 percent of Venezuelans had regular access to safe drinking water. Today, only 30 percent do.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nAnswer: Poor Venezuelans voted for it. If we let them in, they\u2019ll vote for it here, too. (Except 20 percent, who will be patriotic Americans, i.e. Republicans.)\n\nThat\u2019s great news for Sanders and Warren! But it\u2019s terrible news for the country.\n\nDenouncing \u201csqualid oligarchs,\u201d Hugo Chavez promised Venezuela\u2019s poor: \u201cI will not rest until every human being who lives in this land has housing, employment and some way to manage his life.\u201d\n\nThe poor were sold! In December 1998, Chavez was elected in a landslide, commemorated with this Seattle Times headline: \u201cVENEZUELAN SLUM DWELLERS VOTE FOR CHANGE.\u201d\n\nAs the Miami Herald explained, Chavez \u201ccrystallized anger and frustration among Latin America\u2019s poor at free-market policies that have brought only limited prosperity.\u201d\n\nWhat did free markets and private property ever do for the poor? If they were poor, but others were rich, the \u201csqualid oligarchs\u201d must have stolen from them! (Elizabeth Warren should borrow that epithet. \u201cWealthy corporations\u201d is getting old.)\n\nBernie says he \u201cwrote the damn bill\u201d to give Medicare to all, but he was plagiarizing Chavez, who immediately implemented a \u201csingle-payer\u201d system for health care in Venezuela. He set up free health clinics, opened military hospitals to the poor, and deployed tens of thousands of government workers to deliver medical services to the barrios.\n\nAt Chavez\u2019s invitation, thousands of poor people took up residence in hotels, warehouses and luxurious golf courses. As one of the squatters explained, \u201cWe just want a home for our children.\u201d That could be the epitaph of every once-great country: It was for THE CHILDREN!\n\nAs you may have heard, this worked out fantastically well. Within a year of Chavez taking office, the economy had shrunk by 7.2 percent and unemployment was at 20 percent. A decade into this socialist paradise, the poor were poorer than ever. There were constant blackouts, food shortages and appalling infant mortality rates. (Much like what we\u2019re seeing in California.)\n\nVenezuela\u2019s infant mortality from diarrhea alone has sextupled in the past 15 years, according to the World Health Organization. (That\u2019s an estimate, on account of Chavez\u2019s quick response to the crisis, which was to stop releasing public health data.)\n\nPotable water, that most basic element of civilization, is virtually nonexistent. Today, sitting on top of the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuelans are starving.\n\nChavez didn\u2019t seize power in a military coup. There was no revolution. He wasn\u2019t imposed on Venezuelans by the C.I.A.\n\nHe was the people\u2019s choice, elected president in 1998 (with 56 percent of the vote), then re-elected in 2000 (60 percent), then again in 2006 (63 percent) and yet again in 2012 (54 percent). And that\u2019s not counting all the regional, parliamentary, constitutional and referenda elections his party won, over and over and over again.\n\nLike that other Latin American matinee idol, Eva Peron, Chavez destroyed a country by offering the poor pie-in-the-sky promises that were to be paid for by \u201cthe rich.\u201d In both cases, it took only about a decade to turn two of the wealthiest countries in the world into two of the most dysfunctional.\n\nIn Mexico, the people voted for the Institutional Revolutionary Party for 71 straight years. Total economic failure, year after year. Yes, please, kick me again!\n\nAll of this would be of limited interest outside of psychological circles, except for the fact that these voluntary hellholes are adjacent to our country, which is why our southern border is always besieged with desperate Latin Americans.\n\nThey\u2019re fleeing the very systems that they voted for, and which (80 percent) would willingly vote for again.\n\nThe key point is this: Everywhere in the world, the working class loves socialism \u2014 except the U.S.A. To the dismay of American liberals, their movement has always been bereft of the very proletariat that they claim to champion. Instead of truck drivers and longshoremen, Democratic meetings are full of divorcees, transgenders, vegans, and college professors.\n\nRecall that when student radicals tried to organize blue-collar workers in the \u201960s, they ended up getting their heads smashed by building trades guys for protesting the war. Today, America\u2019s working class wears a MAGA hat.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Democrats are dying to fling open our southern border. As Lenin might have said, you can\u2019t make an omelet without bringing in millions of poverty-stricken Latin Americans.", "description": "The left\u2019s enthusiasm for Third World immigrants isn\u2019t only because they vote 8-2 for the Democrats.
