Similar to the blackface controversy surrounding Virginia governor Ralph Northam, the photo was published in the yearbook of West Point Grey Academy for 2000 to 2001 and was taken at an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d gala.\n\nExclusive: Justin Trudeau wore brownface at 2001 \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party while he taught at a private school, Canada's Liberal Party admits https://t.co/j3UobfYNIF \u2014 TIME (@TIME) September 18, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Liberal Party, of which Trudeau is the leader, confirmed that Trudeau is in the photo: \u201cHe attended with friends and colleagues dressed as a character from Aladdin.\u201d But as Time notes, \u201cof the individuals in six photographs from the event published in the yearbook, Trudeau appears to be the only one who darkened his skin.\u201d\n\nLast week, Trudeau began his reelection campaign already battling a scandal over whether he had pressured his former attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large engineering company.\n\nOn board his campaign plane on Wednesday night, Trudeau apologized:\n\nIn 2001, when I was a teacher in Vancouver, I attended a gala. The theme was Arabian Nights. I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put makeup on. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have known better, but I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m really sorry.\n\nI take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. I should have known better. It was something that I didn\u2019t think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.\n\nWhen asked if there were any similar instances in his past, Trudeau mentioned a performance in high school in which he wore \u201cmakeup\u201d to sing \u201cDay-O,\u201d the Jamaican folk song made famous by civil rights activist Harry Belafonte. \u201cI deeply regret that I did that,\u201d he said. Trudeau added that he has \u201calways been more enthusiastic about costumes than sometimes is appropriate,\u201d referring to an incident earlier this year in which he visited India and was criticized for wearing a traditional gown. It was described by the Indian magazine Outlook as \u201ctoo Indian even for an Indian.\u201d\n\nThe Sikh MP Jagmeet Singh, who is the leader of Canada\u2019s New Democratic Party, called the costume \u201cinsulting\u201d and asked reporters: \u201cWho is the real Mr. Trudeau? Is it the one behind closed doors, the one when the cameras are turned off that no one sees? Is that the real Mr. Trudeau? Because more and more, it seems like it is.\u201d Meanwhile, Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party and Trudeau\u2019s challenger in the October election, said that the picture showed \u201ca complete lack of judgement and integrity, and someone who is not fit to govern this country.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, Global News reported a new incident of Trudeau wearing blackface. Though it\u2019s not obvious in the video that the PM is the man painted black and sticking out his tongue, Global News says the Liberal Party has confirmed it\u2019s Trudeau. It\u2019s not clear when or where the video was taken.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "description": "A yearbook photo published by Time shows Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in brownface makeup and a turban and robe at an \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party in 2001.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/18/justin_trudeau.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
