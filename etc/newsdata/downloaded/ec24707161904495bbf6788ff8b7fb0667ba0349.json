We get a notification on the app that shows us the address of where to pick up blood and where to deliver,\" Kalu told CNN.\n\n\"There's also the Google map with directions to the address provided,\" he added.\n\nTeaming up with the tech giant has enabled the company to cut blood delivery times to just 45 minutes, a journey that previously took up to three hours to complete.\n\n\"LifeBank's system shows just how much magic can happen when universally accessible tools and information meet human creativity, aspirations and resilience,\" Mojolaoluwa Aderemi-Makinde, head of Google's Africa marketing team, said in a statement.\n\nThe company is the brainchild of Temie Giwa-Tubosun, a health manager who suffered complications when she was seven months pregnant in 2014.\n\nFounder of LifeBank a healthcare technology and logistics company, Temie Giwa-Tubosun.\n\nGiwa-Tubosun was rushed to hospital where doctors carried out an emergency C-section.\n\n\"I realized after I had my son that the highest cause of maternal mortality is postpartum hemorrhage, the most important thing you can do when a mum is hemorrhaging is replace the blood she has lost, even if you can't stop the bleeding,\" Giwa-Tubuson told CNN.\n\nGiwa-Tubosun says knowing she could have died in childbirth motivated her to work towards making blood more accessible for others and she founded LifeBank in 2016.\n\nSince then the company has raised thousands of dollars in venture capital, launched across three states in Nigeria, serving in more than 300 hospitals and saved up to 4,000 lives.\n\n'Surplus and a shortage of blood'\n\nDonated blood has about six weeks before it becomes too old for transfusion, according to a 2017 study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.\n\nA lot of the time, the blood expires before it is used because doctors find it challenging to get the type of blood they need says Giwa-Tubosun.\n\nShe found that there was a communication lag as doctors struggled to get blood while blood banks were discarding it after the six-week expiration period.\n\n\"One of the insights I got was the existence of a surplus and a shortage of blood. We have people on the supply side discarding expired blood and on the demand side dying because the blood is not available. I thought the solution was to help both sides pass information to each other,\" she said.\n\nWith Lifebank, Giwa-Tubosun was able to connect blood banks with hospitals and their patients.\n\nHer team gathers inventory data from about 52 blood banks across Lagos and responds to requests from hospitals based on the data provided by the banks.\n\n\"Hospitals can find out what blood type and how many units are available by calling our 24-hour call center,\" she explained.", "description": "LifeBank is using Google maps to connect blood banks to hospitals in the country which has helped to significantly cut delivery times.", "authors": ["Aisha Salaudeen"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190731135036-joseph-kalu-lifebank-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
