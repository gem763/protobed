Since that game on September 26, he has been training but has not appeared in any matches.\n\nHowever, World Rugby announced on Wednesday morning that Cokanasiga is one of three nominees for their annual young player prize, on the strength of his early international performances which have yielded seven tries in nine appearances for England.\n\nHe is joined on the shortlist by France fly-half Romain Ntamack and Herschel Jantjies, the young Springbok scrum-half.\n\nSouth Africa scrum-half Herschel Jantjies is also up for the Breakthrough Player award\n\nEngland have had two previous winners of this junior award; Maro Itoje in 2016 and George Ford in 2011.\n\nThe World Rugby awards dinner take place in Tokyo on Sunday and there could be a Red Rose clean sweep of the top categories.\n\nEngland will be favourites for Team of the Year if they have won the Webb Ellis Cup the previous night, while Jones is on course for the coach award and both Itoje and Tom Curry are regarded as contenders for the coveted Player of the Year gong.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO: Joe Cokanasiga has been nominated for World Rugby's Breakthrough Player of the Year award -at the end of what has been a personally frustrating World Cup.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/06/20362732-0-image-a-5_1572417900066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
