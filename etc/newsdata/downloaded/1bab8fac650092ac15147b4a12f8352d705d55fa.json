News publication Quartz had its mobile app pulled yesterday for serving \u201ccontent that is illegal in China,\u201d referencing its ongoing coverage of the pro-democracy protests raging in Hong Kong.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Apple has acquiesced to a number of other demands over the years, including removing VPN apps from the Chinese App Store \u2014 thereby restricting users from accessing overseas sites \u2014 and censoring Hong Kong singers from the Chinese version of Apple Music.\n\nIt\u2019s a known fact that Apple \u2014 and other companies like ByteDance TikTok \u2014 have to tread a fine line in China. These decisions outline the tricky trade-offs the tech giant has to make in order to continue operating in the market, even if that means losing its privacy and security high ground.\n\nBy repeatedly running antithetical to its own global privacy and security mantra, Apple has only made it painfully obvious that it has one set of rules for China and another outside it.\n\nRead next: A bug in Indian local search app exposed over 156 million accounts", "description": "Apple has once again banned HKmap.live, a crowdsourced live app that protestors in Hong Kong have used to track police movements in the city state.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fhkmap-live-hed.png&signature=ae18336536026760218f6713a7870d8d", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
