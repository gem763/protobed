REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nWith the top 10 Democratic candidates sharing the debate stage for the first time, they focused more on their shared opposition to Republican President Donald Trump and pared back some of the bickering that marked the first two debates this summer.\n\nBiden was sharper and more aggressive than in either of the first two debates, when he came under frequent attack for his record on race and criminal justice during his long tenure in the U.S. Senate.\n\nBut like the first two debates, the Democrats were quick to leap into battle on healthcare, the issue that has ignited the most heated disagreements in the campaign for the party\u2019s nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nBiden, who served as vice president for eight years under Barack Obama, said he would build on Obama\u2019s landmark 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. He accused Warren and Sanders of wanting to tear it down with Medicare for All, a proposed government-run healthcare program that would eliminate private insurance.\n\n\u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well I\u2019m for Barack. I think Obamacare worked,\u201d Biden said, asking Warren and Sanders to explain how they would pay for their plans. \u201cThis is about candor, honesty, big ideas.\u201d\n\nWarren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts who has moved into second behind Biden in many opinion polls of the Democratic race, praised Obama\u2019s healthcare efforts but said more was needed.\n\n\u201cNow the question is how best can we improve on it,\u201d she said, adding that under Medicare for All, those at the top would pay more but the middle class would pay less.\n\nAside from the exchange over healthcare, Biden and Warren avoided any direct confrontations. Sanders and former U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro led the charge against Biden.\n\nSanders, who sponsored a bill in the U.S. Senate to create a Medicare for All plan, said the program based on the existing government-run Medicare program for Americans 65 and older was the most cost-effective approach. Some analysts have estimated his plan would cost $32 trillion over a decade.\n\nBiden said his proposal would give Americans more options, including staying with their plans if they like them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never actually met anybody who likes their health insurance company,\u201d Warren fired back.\n\nCastro accused Biden of flip-flopping in his description of his own plan.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro, 44, asked Biden, 76, who has faced questions about his age.\n\nWhen Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, noted the exchange was what people did not like about politicians, Castro shot back: \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d\n\nPRAISE FOR OBAMA\n\nU.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also tried to calm things down, noting: \u201cA house divided cannot stand,\u201d quoting from a famous speech by Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe candidates made an effort to praise the legacy of Obama, after facing criticism from some Democrats after the last debate for attacking his policies on healthcare and immigration.\n\nBut Castro, who has lagged badly in opinion polls, accused Biden of being quick to tie himself to Obama when it suited him and walk away when it did not.\n\n\u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer any questions,\u201d Castro, who served in Obama\u2019s administration, said in his second attack of the night on Biden.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not,\u201d Castro told Biden. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a surprise to him,\u201d Biden responded.\n\nSanders took aim at Biden\u2019s vote as a senator to authorize the U.S. military invasion of Iraq. He said: \u201cI never believed\u201d either President George W. Bush or Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s arguments in favor of the invasion.\n\nWhile the debate was under way, Trump spoke to Republican lawmakers on a retreat in Baltimore, and said the Democrats were reinforcing the need for his re-election.\n\n\u201cYou really have to elect me. Whether you like me or not, it makes no difference, because our country will go to hell if any of these people get in,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe debate was narrowed to one night and 10 candidates after the party toughened the requirements for qualifying. The previous two Democratic debates in June and July featured 20 candidates split over two nights.\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson, one of the contenders who did not qualify for the debate, commented on Twitter that it featured \u201cnice people\u201d but was not a game changer.\n\n\u201cAll incremental. Ultimately boring,\u201d she wrote.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang opened the debate by promising to give $1,000 a month to 10 Americans for the next year, calling it a \u201cfreedom dividend.\u201d The offer drew laughs from a few other contenders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nThe sharp bickering during the first two rounds of the debates dismayed some Democrats, who have urged the candidates to rein in their attacks and focus on laying out their own affirmative agendas.\n\nSlideshow (27 Images)\n\nThe candidates this time tried to emphasize their areas of agreement. Biden praised former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke for his work after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, drawing a sustained ovation from the debate crowd.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who has called for gun licensing and a mandatory gun buyback for assault weapons, was asked if he was going to take away people\u2019s guns.\n\n\u201cI am if it was a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden clashed with progressive challengers Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on healthcare in a debate on Thursday, defending Obamacare and pushing them to be honest about the cost of their plans.", "authors": ["Tim Reid", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429265896&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C04J", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
