And for this act of duty, he was smeared as an untrustworthy foreigner.\n\nLaura Ingraham insinuated on Fox News that Vindman was up to something nefarious: \u201cHere we have a U.S. national-security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest \u2026 Isn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle to this story?\u201d\n\nOn CNN, former Representative Sean Duffy said, \u201cWe all have an affinity to our homeland, where we came from \u2026 He\u2019s entitled to his opinion. He has an affinity for the Ukraine, he speaks Ukrainian, and he came from the country, and he wants to make sure they\u2019re safe and free. I understand that.\u201d\n\nWhen the host, John Berman, asked, \u201cAre you saying a decorated war veteran isn\u2019t looking out for America first, yes or no?\u201d Duffy replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nThe more I watched, the more I seethed, because I am also on that list of foreign-born military leaders, and so are my three younger brothers. We were born in Italy and moved to the United States when I was 11. We learned English as a second language, so that we, too, could be educated and pursue the American dream. Do Duffy and Ingraham believe we have an \u201caffinity\u201d for Italy that supersedes our dedication to the United States? Do they believe we have dual loyalty?\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump\u2019s defenders are now attacking the patriotism of a Purple Heart officer\n\nFor the four Jason brothers, military service has been at the heart of our American experience. Among the four of us, we have more than 95 combined years of active duty and 16 combat deployments (and counting) in the Army, the Navy, and the Marines. Our combined awards include a Purple Heart and a handful of Bronze Stars and Air Medals. Two of us graduated from national military academies. One is a naval aviator. The marine has two tours in Fallujah under his belt.\n\nI seethed over the attacks against Vindman because also on that list of foreign-born soldiers are the Iraqi interpreters I worked with on my first combat tour there. Almost all had to leave their homeland; they came to the United States as refugees to escape certain death for helping the U.S. Army. Many of them are now soldiers in the U.S. Army. Three Iraq-born infantrymen were among the soldiers in the Special Forces Task Force that I commanded in Afghanistan. One was wounded and received a Purple Heart. If anyone is putting America first, it\u2019s these new Americans.\n\nBut on our most watched television networks, men and women who have never fought alongside heroes like Vindman, or my brothers, claim there\u2019s something suspicious about an immigrant who uses his understanding of foreign cultures to serve America.", "description": "I was born abroad and served.
