Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque notes the oil is likely coming from a leaking ship and that its characteristics are similar to Venezuelan heavy crude \u2014 but that does not necessarily indicate that Venezuela is the source. Venezuela\u2019s state oil company has not accepted any responsibility for the issue.", "description": "Over a dozen turtles have been found dead since the spill began.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/fZtbsXg5PT2kc8jEFWDPuT57Ax8=/0x436:4288x2848/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570742810490.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
