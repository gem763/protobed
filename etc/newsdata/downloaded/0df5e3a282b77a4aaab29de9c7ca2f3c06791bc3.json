But they never broke through against Cole, who grinded through seven innings to win his 19th straight decision despite walking five batters for the second time in his career.\n\n\u201cJust boiled down to making some good pitches under pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nCole escaped a bases-loaded jam in the first and stranded nine runners through five, improving to 3-0 with a 0.40 ERA in three playoff outings this year. Poised to become a prized free agent who could command more than $200 million, he\u2019s putting together a dominant run that\u2019s beginning to rival some of baseball\u2019s greatest postseason pitching performances.\n\nThe 29-year-old right-hander, unbeaten in 25 starts since late May, allowed four hits and struck out seven. That ended a streak of 11 consecutive games with double-digit strikeouts \u2014 the previous big league record was eight. Cole led the majors with 326 Ks this season.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the best pitcher in baseball right now,\u201d Astros manager AJ Hinch said. \u201cGerrit is locked in. And to see him do it on the big stage in a playoff game with the magnitude of this game, it was pretty awesome.\u201d\n\nGame 4 in the best-of-seven playoff is scheduled for Wednesday night \u2014 but that could change. The gloomy weather forecast calls for a substantial rainstorm, potentially forcing a postponement that would likely alter pitching plans for both teams.\n\nGleyber Torres homered in the eighth off Houston reliever Joe Smith, one batter after replay umpires reversed a call and ruled Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n out at first base. That led to a little trash and a ball being thrown onto the field before public address announcer Paul Olden reminded fans not to toss any objects out of the stands.\n\nRoberto Osuna got three quick outs in the ninth for a save.\n\n\u201cTwo more to go,\u201d Osuna said. \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nThe bushy-haired Cole grew up in California rooting for the Yankees and was drafted by them 28th overall in 2008. He didn\u2019t sign, choosing instead to attend UCLA before the Pittsburgh Pirates selected him with the top pick in 2011.\n\nMaking his second career start at Yankee Stadium, he got away with several pitches in key situations. Other times, Cole flashed the filthy breaking balls and 98-100 mph heat that have made him so unhittable in October \u2014 and unbeatable since May.\n\nHis winning streak is the longest by a pitcher in one year since Rube Marquard began 19-0 for the 1912 New York Giants.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s exceptional. And he gets better and better and better,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cOnce he found his curveball, it was pretty lights out. I think he finished his outing as strong as ever.\u201d\n\nAfter rolling to a 7-0 victory in the series opener, the Yankees \u2014 the highest-scoring team in the majors this season \u2014 have totaled three runs on two homers in the last 20 innings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a little frustrating we weren\u2019t able to break through with him,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cBut I think up and down we gave ourselves a chance. And anytime you\u2019re facing a guy like that, you want that kind of traffic. And we had that in several innings. He made big pitches when he had to.\u201d\n\nWith two on in the fifth and the Astros clinging to a 2-0 lead, Didi Gregorius lofted a high fly that Reddick caught at the right field fence.\n\n\u201cThe emotions kind of followed the flyball, right?\u201d Cole explained. \u201cSo it was kind of like low, to freaking out, to not so worried anymore.\u201d\n\nThe three-time All-Star finally found his rhythm after that, retiring his last seven batters with three strikeouts.\n\nHe called his early fastball command \u201cspotty,\u201d but his ability to pitch out of trouble prevented a lively sellout crowd of 48,998 from really ever letting loose.\n\n\u201cI mean, we just had to work it,\u201d Cole said.\n\nGregorius also grounded out with the bases loaded to end the first.\n\n\u201cMost of the game was on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come through, so I was the one that failed, not the whole team.\u201d\n\nHouston got a rally going in the seventh against scuffling reliever Adam Ottavino. George Springer walked and went to third when Altuve executed a perfect run-and-hit single through the right side.\n\nAfter savvy baserunning by Springer to stay in a rundown long enough to get runners to second and third, Altuve scored on Zack Britton\u2019s wild pitch. Yuli Gurriel made it 4-0 with a sacrifice fly.\n\nLET\u2019S GET IT STARTED\n\nThe 5-foot-6 Altuve connected on Severino\u2019s third pitch for his fourth homer of these playoffs, extending his postseason hitting streak to 12 games dating to last year.\n\n\u201cI think everybody knows I like swinging the bat,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like wasting too much time on home plate.\u201d\n\nFAST COMPANY\n\nCole has 32 strikeouts in the playoffs while allowing just one run. He joined Astros teammate Justin Verlander (2013 with Detroit) and Kevin Brown (1998 for San Diego) as the only pitchers to whiff at least 30 and permit no more than one run in a three-game postseason span, according to STATS.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees LF Giancarlo Stanton sat out for the second consecutive game because of a strained right quadriceps. He was replaced in the lineup by CF Aaron Hicks, who batted ninth in his first start since Aug. 3 due to a strained flexor near his right elbow. Brett Gardner shifted from center to left. Hicks went 0 for 2 with two walks.\n\nOUT AT HOME\n\nPlate umpire Jeff Nelson exited with a concussion after taking two foul balls off his mask, causing a 16-minute delay before the fifth inning. Kerwin Danley, who was at second base, went inside and changed into gear to work the plate. Mark Carlson switched from third to second and Marvin Hudson from left field to third. Severino was given additional time to warm up again, and the game proceeded with a five-man crew and no left field ump.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams were planning bullpen games Wednesday night, but a rainout would allow them to bring back the Game 1 starters on full rest in Game 4 if it gets pushed to Thursday.\n\nYankees right-hander Masahiro Tanaka beat Zack Greinke in the opener last Saturday at Houston, improving to 5-2 with a 1.32 ERA in seven career postseason outings. Tanaka has permitted only one run and four hits over 11 innings in winning both his playoff games this year, while Greinke is 0-2 with an 8.38 ERA in two starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Gerrit Cole is making his pitch to own this October.
