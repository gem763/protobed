Check out our guide below to find the perfect coat for your body type.\n\n1. Petite Frame\n\nIf you're petite, Garcia says that the main struggle can be to find a coat that you wear and doesn't wear you. She says avoid any coats that are too long and have too much volume. Instead, search for a coat that has a belt and find a coat in a solid color or a fun animal print since a coat with volume and embellishments can weigh you down.\n\n2. Pear-shaped frame with wide hips\n\nFor someone who has larger hips, thighs and booty but has a smaller waist, an A-Line silhouette is perfect to create an hour-glass shape. Garcia points out that a dramatic collar or hood will draw the eyes up toward your shoulders but balance your lower half.\n\n3. Busty\n\nWomen with big busts can sometimes have the issue where coats fit everywhere except that area, making them difficult to close and causing them look larger than they actually are. Garcia says that a coat with a sleek-fitted silhouette in a stretchy material won\u2019t add extra volume and will allow movement of the fabric across the chest. She says to avoid billowy tops with volume and full sleeves.", "description": "The Right Fit: How to find the perfect coat for your body", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/TheRightFit_CoatsJackets_v03_AG_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
