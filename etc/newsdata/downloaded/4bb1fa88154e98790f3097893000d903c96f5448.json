The company suffers not only from changes in consumer tastes, but also accounting problems, a heavy debt load and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Buffett has expressed regrets over Berkshire tremendous investment in the \u201cold\u201d Kraft and involvement in the 2015 merger with Heinz Co.\n\nAmong other investments, Buffett recently added to Berkshire\u2019s Amazon.com AMZN, -0.57% holdings, after the position was first made public in May.\n\nRead: Buffett says Amazon stock purchase doesn\u2019t deviate from value-investing principles\n\nBerkshire also has been increasing its holdings of bank stocks. The company is the largest owner of Bank of America BAC, +0.66%, with more than 10% of the common shares. Buffett said earlier this year that shares of large U.S. banks, including Berkshire holding JPMorgan Chase JPM, +0.59%, are significantly undervalued by the market.\n\nBerkshire sold its position in Oracle ORCL, -0.19% and trimmed its Apple AAPL, -0.13% holdings earlier this year.\n\nIn May, Buffett said he planned to \u201cput a lot of money\u201d into energy-sector investments.\n\nBerkshire portfolio winners and losers of 2019\n\nBecause of the continual changes in the portfolio, this list of Berkshire\u2019s 45 publicly traded holdings as of June 30 is sorted by total return this year, and includes longer periods measuring returns, regardless of when Buffett decided to initiate, add to or trim positions:\n\nHas Buffett lost his touch?\n\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway are down 2% this year through Aug. 28, compared to a 17% total return for the S&P 500. Berkshire\u2019s 15-year total return has lagged the S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% slightly:\n\nFactSet\n\nBut check out this 20-year chart:\n\nFactSet\n\nThat is remarkable outperformance.\n\nDuring Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, when asked if he would recommend investors buy shares of the company or invest in the S&P 500, Buffett said: \u201cI think the financial result would be very close to the same.\u201d\n\nThen again, Buffet, through Berkshire\u2019s tremendous hoard of cash ($119 billion in cash and short-term investments in short-term U.S. Treasury notes as of June 30), has tremendous power to scoop up bargains if the stock market falls. He displayed this power through his preferred-stock investments in Bank of America and Goldman Sachs during the financial crisis. These turned out to be extremely lucrative when the preferred shares were converted to common shares.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Seeking attractive dividend stocks?
