Feel free to recite it for them before they go to bed or when they\u2019ve misbehaved and need to be punished. It\u2019s based on this Jezebel report about Piety & Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House, the new book about Vice-President Pence by journalist Tom LoBianco. Per Jezebel, when Trump won the presidential election in November 2016, bee mistress and towel-charm maven Karen \u201cMother\u201d Pence rebuffed his celebratory advances:\n\nEarly in the morning of Wednesday, November 9, Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump and conceded. After Trump took the call, Mike Pence leaned in to kiss Karen, but she rebuffed him. \u201cYou got what you wanted, Mike. Leave me alone.\u201d Upstairs, at the Pence\u2019s private suite \u2014 separate from the Trumps\u2019 \u2014 he tried again for a victory kiss, and again she told him to back off.\n\nPence presumably then went to dejectedly nurse a double shot of milk on the rocks.\n\nAccording to LoBianco, it\u2019s not Mike but Mother who \u201crules the roost\u201d of the Pence household, which was already pretty clear given reports that the vice-president calls his wife \u201cMother\u201d and won\u2019t dine alone with other women, and that video of the time he was forced to watch helplessly as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke danced energetically with his wife, quite literally sweeping her off her feet. At least she didn\u2019t call Zinke \u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
