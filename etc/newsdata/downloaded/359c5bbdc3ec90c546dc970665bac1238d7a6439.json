God loves the world so much that He gave His only Son, Jesus Christ, who lived a perfect life, died on the cross for our sins, and was raised from the dead on the third day. The good news is that through repentance of your sin and faith in the risen Christ you can have true joy and happiness which is found only in Jesus.\"\n\nHe describes West's services as a \"worship event\" where the \"goal is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ in a world that is hurting and in a world that is looking for answers.\"\n\nThe husband and father of five said a lot of people come to the Sunday Service one way -- perhaps simply hoping to hear a Kanye hit -- but he hopes they leave having had an encounter with God.\n\n\"It feels like half the crowd comes because they are Kanye fans, but we want them to leave knowing Jesus Christ,\" Tyson said. \"We want them to know that there is something better than what the world offers. The answer is found in Jesus, in knowing Him, loving Him, and walking in obedience to Him.\"\n\nHe added: \"Sunday Service is about a God-exalting testimony, Christ-centered preaching, and Spirit-filled worship that points people to the goodness and greatness of God. We want America and the world to see the love of God through Jesus Christ.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAlso on Saturday, one interaction may have illustrated the famously me-centric West is no longer about himself.\n\nAfter someone shouted \"Thank you, Kanye!\" at the Sunday Service where he defended his support for President Trump, West reportedly responded, \"Who said 'Thank you, Kanye?' I want you to say is, 'Thank you, Jesus.'\"", "description": "Kanye West has had several friends preach at his Sunday Service, but since he started making them public, one little-known\u00a0pastor from Los Angeles has started catching the ear of many of those gathered --\u00a0but who is he?", "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Adam Tyson", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
