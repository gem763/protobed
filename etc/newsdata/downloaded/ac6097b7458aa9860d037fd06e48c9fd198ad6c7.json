This could include the left-leaning New Democratic Party or even the separatist Bloc Quebecois.\n\nThe Big Picture:\n\n\u201cI would anticipate that the budget deficit next year would be bigger than originally forecast, which means interest rates will be a little bit higher on the front end of the curve, so less of a reason for the BOC to cut rates.\u201d \u2013 Ed Devlin\n\n\u201cIf a Liberal and NDP coalition holds, spending is likely to increase meaningfully and deficits are likely to get larger in the next two years. This likely means a weaker loonie over the medium term.\u201d \u2013 Mike Archibald\n\nTrudeau\u2019s government would create the potential for a small boost to economic growth and that should support the outlook for corporate profits and stock prices going forward. \u2013 Candice Bangsund\n\n\u201cThis is horrible news for Canada\u2019s energy sector, which is struggling to get its oil to global markets in the absence of increased pipeline capacity.\u201d \u2013 Stephen Innes\n\n\u201cI think it will be a less popular destination for international funds, for money, for investing.\u201d \u2013 Thomas Caldwell\n\nEnergy Risk\n\nThe energy sector faces risk as it could see some negative fallout following the election results as one \u201cmajor area of contention\u201d will be the construction of pipelines to reduce the bottlenecks in Canadian crude markets, said Bangsund, who helps manage $150 billion (US$115 billion) at Fiera Capital.\n\nSome are cautiously optimistic. \u201cIt remains possible that the Trans Mountain expansion will proceed as it has already received Cabinet approval,\u201d said David Doyle, analyst at Macquarie. \u201cThe same cannot be said for any new proposed pipelines, which face an even more challenged path ahead.\u201d\n\nPessimism has creeped in for others. \u201cWe have a swath of uncertainty around energy yet again, so I expect a sell off on the stock side, starting today and going over the next couple of months until we have a clear picture on where policy may be going,\u201d said Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife. For bond investors, the companies do have the cash flow to meet their interest payment, he added.\n\nDeficits to Expand\n\n\u201cIn terms of economics you\u2019re going to see deficits increase. I think it will be a less popular destination for international funds, for money, for investing,\u201d said Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Investment Management. \u201cMy gut feel is we will see deficits, we will see less productive spending, less attractive environment to invest funds.\u201d\n\nThe Liberals pledged to increase the government deficit to $27.4 billion (US$21 billion) next year to fund new campaign promises, bringing it above 1 per cent of gross domestic product for the first time since 2012.\n\n\u201cSignificantly larger\u201d budget deficits are expected given that the Liberals may need to rely on NDP support for some programs,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO. That number could swell to close to $30 billion next year. \u201cI would just expect the net result to be a significantly larger budget deficit \u2014 not anything to be overly concerned about.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a Liberal and NDP coalition holds, spending is likely to increase meaningfully and deficits are likely to get larger in the next two years. This likely means a weaker loonie over the medium term,\u201d said Archibald, associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments\n\nMacro Outlook\n\nFrom a macro perspective, \u201cgrowth-enhancing fiscal stimulus\u201d reinforces the view that the Bank of Canada can maintain a \u201csidelined approach\u201d even as the Federal Reserve pursues easier monetary policies, Bangsund said. The narrowing rate differentials between Canada and the U.S. lends support to the Canadian dollar, she said.\n\nMonetary policy has been the driver of economic growth in Canada, but now that rates are much lower they will be a lot less effective going forward, which means having effective fiscal policy is going to be much more critical than it was in the past, PIMCO\u2019s Devlin said.\n\n\u201cThe loonie, which is a gauge of what investors think, hasn\u2019t reacted much, which means markets were priced for this,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Toole, credit portfolio manager at CIBC Asset Management, who helps manage $70 billion in fixed income, in Toronto. \u201cThere is still a sense from investors that Canada is still steady as it goes, it\u2019s got a sound government.\u201d\n\nTelcos Concern\n\nAnother sector that could be impacted include telecommunications companies, Macquarie\u2019s Doyle said. The Liberal party\u2019s pledge to cut cellphone bills by 25 per cent could be supported by the NDP and Bloc Quebecois.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party pledged to cut wireless services costs by 25 per cent within four years and the New Democratic Party also indicated that if elected, it would implement price caps on mobile phone and internet services that would save families about $10 (US$7.53) per month. The Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association said last month that wireless prices have already dropped by about 30 per cent over the past three years.\n\n\u201cTrudeau\u2019s policy will weigh on telco companies, though I don\u2019t expect a big selloff,\u201d Manulife\u2019s Petursson said.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Investors and analysts weigh in on what to expect from a Liberal minority in parliament", "authors": ["Paula Sambo", "Divya Balji", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trudeau-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
