Wall, defending creation of the Financial Oversight and Management Board, which is intended to steer Puerto Rico out of record bankruptcy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you take the challengers\u2019 argument to its natural conclusion, Wall told Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, \u201cit will threaten to undermine, indeed I think it would condemn in its entirety, home rule.\u201d\n\nBondholders led by Aurelius Investment LLC and a public employees union want to undo the board\u2019s work and seek more favorable results from a new board.\n\nThey are challenging how Congress set up the board when it passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act in 2016. It called for the president to choose seven of the eight members, and if they were mostly chosen from lists provided by congressional leaders, Senate confirmation was unnecessary. President Barack Obama did so, with the eighth member chosen by the Puerto Rico government.\n\nAD\n\nThe board went to work trying to restructure the island\u2019s debt, and the bondholders sued. They said the board members were officers of the United States, subject to the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause, and as such required Senate confirmation.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit agreed with the challengers that board members require Senate confirmation. But the court approved the board\u2019s previous work under the de facto officer doctrine, which validates decisions made by officials who believe their appointments are legal.\n\nThat would protect the board\u2019s previous work, Wall told the court, but not the work ahead.\n\nThe legal wrangling has profound consequences, and the Supreme Court took the case on an expedited basis. Donald B. Verrilli Jr., solicitor general under Obama, represented the oversight board, and Theodore B. Olson, solicitor general under President George W. Bush, argued for Aurelius.\n\nAD\n\nVerrilli said Congress was careful in creating the board and it recognized the board members were territorial, not federal officers.\n\nAD\n\nThe congressional act \u201csets up an entity within the territorial government,\u201d Verrilli said. \u201cIt gives the board only territory-specific authority and instructs the board to pursue only territory-specific objectives. The board acts on behalf of Puerto Rico as its representative in judicial proceedings to restructure the territory\u2019s debts. It pursues only Puerto Rico\u2019s interests in those proceedings.\u201d\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was skeptical that the board was part of the local government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s above the Puerto Rican government, and it\u2019s above the legislature and the governor,\u201d Ginsburg said.\n\nAD\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were born on the island and who has been a frequent visitor there, agreed.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that your very argument that it\u2019s independent is suggesting it can\u2019t belong to the territory and that there\u2019s a serious problem that the federal government is creating an entity that no one can control,\u201d Sotomayor told Verrilli. \u201cNeither Congress nor the president can remove this entity for anything but cause.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Olson seem to get the tougher questions, and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wondered what the challenge was really about.\n\n\u201cMr. Olson, are you and your client here just to defend the integrity of the Constitution, or would one be excessively cynical to think that something else is involved here involving money?\u201d Alito asked.\n\nAD\n\nOlson said that of course money was at stake, but that his clients deserved to have their claims heard by constitutionally appointed officers.\n\nSeveral justices seemed to be in rough agreement that if they thought the board performed a primarily local function, Olson would lose. But Olson reiterated that Congress created the board because the island\u2019s debt was a national crisis and concern.\n\nOlson also disputed Wall\u2019s contention that any of the tests challengers proposed for declaring whether someone is a federal officer would result in a loss of home rule.\n\nAD\n\nJessica Mendez-Colbert, representing a Puerto Rican labor union, urged the court to use the case to overturn the \u201cInsular Cases,\u201d a group of cases in which the Supreme Court found that Americans in territories do not have the same constitutional rights.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe court-made doctrine of territorial incorporation means that when my client, and even myself, return to Puerto Rico, we will have a lesser set of constitutional rights than what we have standing here today,\u201d she said.\n\nThere was sympathy from Justice Stephen G. Breyer, but the court did not seem particularly interested in taking on yet another issue.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see the pertinence of the Insular Cases \u201d to the case at hand, said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\n\nAD", "description": "At issue is whether the board\u2019s members were appointed in a way that comports with Constitution.", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bg7vYl3IFC-rpOs8fgyxM7Y_a_A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JSVZNIFMTUI6TIGJNUWXQGHT3I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
