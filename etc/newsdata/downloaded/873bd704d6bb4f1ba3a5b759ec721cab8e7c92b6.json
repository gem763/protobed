The Chelsea striker, who has been called up for his first competitive senior matches for the national side, also revealed that the squad had discussed defying Uefa protocols.\n\nThe governing body has a three-step procedure that it insists must be followed in the event of racist chants from the stands. The first two steps are an appeal over the PA system for the abuse to stop, after the referee has been notified, and a temporary suspension to the game. If neither works, the official should abandon the match.\n\nEnglish police urged Uefa to reschedule Friday night Prague game amid fan fears Read more\n\nIn Abraham\u2019s opinion, there ought to be only one step. If there is any racist chanting, he feels the players should leave the field straight away \u2013 and he said that the England captain, Harry Kane, had led a conversation on that issue at a team meeting on Monday.\n\nEngland face Czech Republic in Prague on Friday before they travel to Sofia, where the racism fears have been sparked by the behaviour of the Bulgaria support in the qualifiers against the Czechs and Kosovo in June. As punishment, Bulgaria\u2019s Stadion Vasil Levski has been partially closed for the next two internationals, one of which is the England game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had meetings about it [racist abuse from the crowd] and we\u2019ve touched base on how to deal with the situation,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cHarry Kane even said that if it happens and we\u2019re not happy with it, we all come off the pitch together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a team thing. Don\u2019t isolate one person. Harry did ask the question about instead of going through the three steps \u2013 if we decide that we want to stop the game, no matter what the score is \u2013 if we\u2019re not happy as a team we\u2019ll decide whether or not to stay on the pitch.\n\n\u201cWatching the gaffer [Gareth Southgate] speaking yesterday, he was quite keen on putting a stop to it. No one wants it in football. It\u2019s not just affecting one person, it\u2019s affecting the team. If we decide that we don\u2019t want to play this game because of what\u2019s going on, we\u2019ll come off as a team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d just let the FA or whoever deal with whatever\u2019s next \u2013 the scores or what happens with the points. At the time, it\u2019s about making sure we\u2019re a team, we don\u2019t stand for it and we want the world to see that we don\u2019t stand for the silly abuse.\u201d\n\nAbraham was asked directly whether it should be one strike and out rather than three. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just one strike because it gives people excuses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLike we were all saying yesterday, if it happens and let\u2019s say there\u2019s a warning or whatever in the stadium, then it happens again, we have to make a decision as a team and with the staff.\u201d\n\nIt has been a tumultuous season for Abraham. Back at Chelsea after consecutive season-long loans at Bristol City, Swansea and Aston Villa, he missed the decisive penalty in the club\u2019s second game \u2013 the European Super Cup defeat to Liverpool \u2013 and was racially abused on social media afterwards.\n\n\u201cI dealt with that in the best way possible,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cI stayed away from Twitter and all social media and I just spent time with my teammates and my family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken many times about it. It\u2019s not acceptable. It\u2019s not an excuse for people to hide behind computers and say whatever they want to say. Whoever doesn\u2019t have my personality might be affected [by it] more.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAbraham, who has since scored nine goals for Chelsea to earn his England selection, has also been in the headlines because of Nigeria\u2019s desire to have him declare for them. The 22-year-old qualifies for the African nation through his father and because his two caps for England came in the friendlies against Germany and Brazil in November 2017 he has had to option to switch his allegiance. Abraham will be committed to England if he features against Czech Republic or Bulgaria and he said that he always wanted to play for them.\n\n\u201cMy dream was always to play for England,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m born and grown in England. Nigeria is a big nation, I love both nations. My head was just screwed on with England. When you\u2019re playing in the Premier League or playing in England, you always want to play for England. I\u2019m here [in the squad] and I\u2019m ready to stay. I want to do the best I can and that means playing well for club and country.\u201d\n\nThe Sheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson has been called up to the squad to replace the injured Tom Heaton.", "description": "Tammy Abraham says the England squad have discussed flouting Uefa\u2019s three-step rule against Bulgaria and walking off the pitch as a team in response to racism from the stands", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2d9350e0836f1ba6b3b9caf2406cb9d44b9334c/0_51_3372_2024/master/3372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c6a2677dcf67c9aab7519a8d9f395005", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
