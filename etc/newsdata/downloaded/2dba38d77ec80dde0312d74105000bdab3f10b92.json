Photo: Shutterstock and Getty Images\n\nWe\u2019ve already had one television personality infiltrate politics, but CNN and the New York Times, who moderated last night\u2019s Democratic Presidential Debate, want to add another: Ellen DeGeneres. At the merciful finale of a seemingly never-ending debate, Anderson Cooper asked the last question and it wasn\u2019t about climate change, or immigration, or anything else voters might want to hear about. It was about Ellen and George W. Bush, whose name hasn\u2019t been heard so close to the word \u201cpresidential\u201d since he physically held office.\n\nEach candidate was asked to talk about a person who, despite their differences, they\u2019re able to get along with, \u00e0 la Ellen\u2019s recent admission that she\u2019s friends with G.W.B. despite all of his war crimes. Everybody makes mistakes? Everybody has those days? Anyway, in response Juli\u00e1n Castro made the distinction that public servants like Bush should be held accountable when those \u201cdifferences\u201d are affecting everyday people, Tulsi Gabbard talked about former congressman Trey Gowdy, Tom Steyer talked about a clean-water activist, Beto O\u2019Rourke mentioned Representative Will Hurd, Cory Booker said Senator James M. Inhofe, Yang talked about a Trump supporter he converted to the Yang Gang, Kamala Harris talked about Senator Rand Paul, Pete Buttigieg said it\u2019s the people he met while fighting in Afghanistan, Bernie Sanders said Senator Mike Lee, Elizabeth Warren mentioned a Republican solicitor general, and both Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden spoke about John McCain. Cool, but what about the planet?\n\nAfter the moderators \u201cSorry to this man\u201d-ed Earth, many viewers, including Governor Jay Inslee, who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year, tweeted their disappointment about how there was time for an Ellen question, but not for a climate change question. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in a rush to solve some sort of climate crisis, right? (Wrong.) Angry tweets below!\n\nNot one single question about the climate crisis.\n\nNot one single question about the climate crisis.\n\nNot one single question about the climate crisis.\n\n\n\nThis is the existential crisis of our time. Not one single question, and that\u2019s completely inexcusable. #DemDebate \u2014 Jay Inslee (@JayInslee) October 16, 2019\n\nThree hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration.\n\n\n\nClimate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.\n\n\n\nBut you know, Ellen.#DemocraticDebate \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 16, 2019\n\nTwo hours and 45 minutes later, CNN still hasn\u2019t asked about climate change or campaign finance reform.\n\n\n\nCNN, just now: In the spirit of Ellen Degeneres, \u201ctell us about a friendship that you\u2019ve had that would surprise us.\u201d\n\n\n\n*shrieks*#DemDebate \u2014 Emma Vigeland (@EmmaVigeland) October 16, 2019\n\nWhen you're eight hours into the debate and Anderson Cooper asks a question about Ellen pic.twitter.com/19orEhk50U \u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) October 16, 2019\n\nTHIS QUESTION ABOUT ELLEN IS SO STUPID. \u2014 Akilah Hughes (@AkilahObviously) October 16, 2019", "description": "Anderson Cooper ended a Democratic debate by asking about Ellen DeGeneres and George W.
