So, for me, I responded in ways that are uncharacteristic and, like I said, I had to acknowledge that fact.\u201d\n\nIrving said he wanted to re-sign with the Celtics but his home life \u201chas way higher precedence than the organization or anyone and I barely got a chance to talk to my grandfather before he passed, from playing basketball.\u201d He said he thought he could \u201cbattle through\u201d his struggles through the team.\n\nNETS NOT PLANNING FOR DURANT TO PLAY THIS SEASON\n\n\u201cAnd I failed these guys in a sense that I didn\u2019t give them everything that I could have during that season, especially without the amount of pieces that we had,\u201d he said. \u201cMy relationship with them personally were great but in terms of me being a leader in that environment and bringing everyone together, I failed.\u201d\n\nIrving played 67 games for the Celtics during the 2018-19 season. He averaged 23.8 points and 6.9 assists during the year and made his third consecutive All-Star appearance. But Boston was eliminated from the playoffs in the second round.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn the offseason, Irving signed with the Nets on a four-year, $136.4 million contract.
