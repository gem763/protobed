But instead of expanding American power in the region, these efforts have merely exposed Washington\u2019s shortcomings in policy-making and execution and reduced its influence in the Gulf. Furthermore, they have offered a tailwind to the \u201cresistance axis\u201d as far afield as Yemen and Damascus.\n\nSimply put, if you think our weaknesses were exposed in Northern Syria this week, wait for the second act in the Gulf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we have seen, Washington\u2019s efforts to destabilize Iran and Trump\u2019s mercantilist approach to foreign policy have pushed our adversaries\u2014i.e, Iran, Russia, and China\u2014to create new, multilateral mechanisms for Gulf security that strike directly at the Trump administration\u2019s scattershot and contradictory efforts.\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nTo counter Iran and to broaden the policy of maximum pressure, Washington proposed in 2017 to sponsor the deployment of a fighting Arab coalition, including Egyptian and Saudi troops, to areas of Syria occupied by Washington\u2019s Kurdish allies in the north-east. America\u2019s Arab allies nodded politely when Washington presented this idea of a hostile Arab occupation in Syria to shore up its losing bet on the opposition. But the idea was eventually dropped.\n\nMeanwhile, the historic deployment of Russian troops on the Golan frontier, the Russian Air Force base in Syria (including an umbrella of top-of-the-line Russian air defense systems ), and growing military cooperation with NATO ally Turkey are the most notable examples of how Moscow has leveraged its decision to save the Ba\u2019ath regime into a broad strategic advance. It other words, it made its partnerships work, and that is no more evident than in today\u2019s headlines in northern Syria, where, in the wake of TRump\u2019s decision to retreat, Moscow is leading the effort to reconcile Ankara and Damascus.\n\nWillfully ignorant of its losses, Washington is still under the impression that it still commands sway over security issues in the Middle East, and the ill-considered notion of an Arab NATO continues to bounce around the Pentagon.\n\nJust this month the Pentagon\u2019s chief civilian Middle East policy official, Mick Mulroy, briefed remaining potential members of this \u201cMiddle East Strategic Alliance\u201d called \u201cOperation Sentinel.\u201d No longer aimed at curing Syria\u2019s overwhelming ills, Mulroy invoked the September 14 attacks on Saudi oil facilities at Abqaiq to promote the idea of a \u201cwhole of government cooperation across economic, security, energy and political spheres.\u201d\n\nLast year Arab states were told that such an organization could be tailored to highlight the individual strengths of their state \u2014Saudi and Emirati air power, Egyptian land forces to build a collective security framework strong enough to confront the \u201cresistance axis\u201d\u2014a power bloc that includes Iran, and Shia militias in Iraq, Syria, Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen\u2014and facilitate U.S. efforts to establish a new generation of missile defense networks throughout the area.\n\nEgypt is the vital backbone of any American effort to establish collective Arab security institutions. But as much as it depends upon Washington\u2019s good graces (Abdel Fattah Al Sisi is Trump\u2019s \u201cfavorite dictator\u201d) for military and political support, Cairo has found nothing compelling in the offer and has taken itself out of the Arab NATO toolbox.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, similar efforts to establish a US-led front whose security needs would be filled by U.S. arms sales has been pursued under a series of names \u2014from the Middle East Command to Middle East Defense Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and Central Treaty Organization\u2014usually aimed at isolating Arab nationalists and Moscow.\n\nLike many bright ideas, a U.S.-engineered Arab commitment to mutual defense sounds attractive, but fails the reality test. Skeptics within the national security community even back then had assed that such efforts were merely \u201cformalizing the weakness\u201d of tottering and unstable Arab regimes trying to win military aid from the West without antagonizing anti-imperialist public opinion.\n\nIn 1955, the Pentagon, in an analysis that would not be out of place today, warned: \u201cThe immediate effects of a loose regional defence grouping\u2026 backed by U.S. military aid programs would be primarily political and psychological rather than military. Such developments would not materially affect the internal weaknesses, that have thus far undermined Middle East strength and stability and would by no means eliminate the tensions and fears that have thus far alienated much of the area from the West. Such a loose grouping would not result in any significant reduction of the area\u2019s military vulnerability.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2019 and the confounding stream of mixed messages coming from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Last Spring, Washington responded to growing Iranian dangers to tanker traffic by sending 2500 additional troops to the region. Yet on June 24, only days after Iran shot down a U.S. intelligence drone, Trump announced a historic revision of U.S. security policy in the Gulf, eschewing any American interest in leading at all.\n\nTrump tweeted that \u201cChina gets 91% of its Oil from the Straight, Japan 62%, & many other countries likewise. So why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation. All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey. We don\u2019t even need to be there (author emphasis) in that the U.S. has just become (by far) the largest producer of Energy anywhere in the world!\u201d\n\nNevertheless, with no apparent memory of the ongoing effort to cobble together an Arab NATO, the recent troop deployments, or a desire to shape a coherent policy that included it \u2014Trump\u2019s scolding of allies proceeded in tandem with July\u2019s announcement of the CENTCOM-led Operation Sentinel to safeguard oil and gas shipments from Iranian predations.\n\nThe Chinese Navy has not visited Hormuz since Cheng Ho\u2019s Treasure Fleet set anchor there in the early 15th century. Xi Jinping no doubt welcomes Trump\u2019s historic acknowledgement of Beijing\u2019s interest in expanding China\u2019s reach to the strategic waterway, but as in all things, prefers to do so according to its own calculations. Like Japan it will not take up Washington\u2019s offer. Nor will the EU, which is interested in re-engaging Washington and Teheran in a diplomatic dialogue.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a crucial, delicate moment where the most relevant attitude to take \u2014 the most responsible attitude to take \u2014 should be that of maximum restraint and avoiding any escalation on the military side,\u201d cautions Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s diplomatic chief.\n\nMany of Washington\u2019s traditional allies have been spooked by Trump\u2019s belligerence, and even before Trump\u2019s withdrawal from Syria last week, have reduced their military footprint in the region. Paris, Berlin, The Hague and Tokyo prefer less confrontational means to assure the safe traffic in energy and each has an abiding interest in cooperating with rather than confronting Iran. So far only the UK, Australia, Bahrain and most recently Saudi Arabia\u2014have signed on to the Pentagon plan.\n\nEscalation of the kinetic sort however, by intent or miscalculation, is a growing prospect. A new normal, defined by the use of clashing military arsenals, whether to send a signal, as in the repeated shelling near Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone, or to do real damage like the recent routing of Saudi troops along the Saudi-Yemeni border, has emerged along multiple arenas of confrontation.\n\nBut instead of horsewhipping Iran and its Houthi allies, Washington and its Saudi ally have suffered a series of ignominious blows that have advanced the impression that Trump, for all his bluster, is, in fact a paper tiger, hawking expensive weapons unsuited to the \u201cwar between war\u201d expertise of the Iranians and their allies and no more willing than his predecessor to use force to protect Washington\u2019s Arab allies.\n\nWashington pronounced itself \u201clocked and loaded\u201d after the downing of a U.S. drone by Iran in June. And it looked on in disbelief as a well-coordinated attack on Saudi oil facilities in September went undetected by U.S. intelligence and undefended by U.S. weapons supplied to Riyadh. In the former incident Washington eschewed a military response for more sanctions\u2014a policy instrument that has become Washington\u2019s default almost everywhere. In the latter, the Pentagon has decided to do more of the same, sending more Patriots and U.S. forces to operate them, the modern day version of shutting the barn door after the horses have escaped..\n\nBoth are merely stopgap measures that do nothing to address the hollowness of American security policies in the Gulf, promoted not because of their effectiveness, but rather because no one can think of anything better to do.\n\nLittle wonder then that Vladimir Putin, together with the presidents of Turkey and Iran, had a nice laugh at Washington\u2019s expense, in a public mocking of the failure of U.S. supplied weapons to prevent the attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\n\u201cAll the political leaders of Saudi Arabia have to do is take a wise decision, as Iran did by buying the S-300 missile system, and as President Erdogan did when he bought Russia\u2019s latest S-400 Triumph anti-aircraft system,\u201d Putin remarked, prompting laughter from President Hassan Rouhani alongside him.\n\nLike a modern day Gulliver, the Trump administration has been all but immobilized by the modulated, well-considered military challenges from Iran. Responding to these encounters in haphazard, ill-considered fashion only highlights the persistent failure of this administration to use the policymaking system to actually make policy, leaving the region not only a far more unstable and dangerous place than it need be, but also creating once-in-a-generation opportunities for those with an interest in profiting at Washington\u2019s expense.\n\nGeoffrey Aronson is chairman and co-founder of The Mortons Group, and a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-orb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
