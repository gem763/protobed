For years the same telcos have filled the top ten positions, with occasional changes to rank and position. But things just got turned on their head.\n\nThanks to the ACCC, NBN providers are now forced to reveal the speeds you can realistically expect to receive during busy hours. It turns out that some providers do a better job at delivering on those speed than others - and some new startups are beginning to creep into prime position.\n\nHere's the current Top 11 providers, based on typical evening NBN 100 speeds.\n\nProvider Typical speed Superloop 90Mbps Aussie Broadband 86Mbps Vodafone 85Mbps Tangerine Telecom 83Mbps iiNet 83mbps MyRepublic 83Mbps Telstra 80Mbps Optus 80Mbps Internode 78.6Mbps TPG 78Mbps Exetel 77Mbps\n\nWe've also broken down the pricing, inclusions and cheaper offerings below.\n\nSuperloop\n\nSuperloop is one of the newest NBN providers on the block, but is already making waves thanks to its high-speed plans. The telco reports evening speeds of 90Mbps on its NBN 100 plans, making it one of the fastest providers around.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to think of Superloop as just another NBN provider, it stands out from the crowd thanks to its own robust infrastructure. It\u2019s one of the few telcos with a physical connection to every NBN Point of Interconnect, and it has a whole lot of subsea cable capacity and domestic fibre. Other poviders often need to outsource this. Essentially, Superloop has far greater control over its network than most providers, which helps with faster speeds as well as troubleshooting.\n\nIn addition, Superloop reports evening speeds of 44.4Mbps on NBN 50 plans, which is also up there with the best of the best.\n\nAussie Broadband\n\nIf you're not familiar with Aussie Broadband, now is the time to check it out. Aussie Broadband is one of the few NBN providers that really seems to pride itself on doing a great job. This includes not offering NBN 12 plans, which we all know are the curse of Australian internet.\n\nAussie Broadband says its customers rarely encounter congestion - even during peak times - and to prove it, published bandwidth graphs that show how much capacity it has purchased on the network versus how much capacity its customers are using. Aussie Broadband is the only major telco to provide this much transparency around its NBN performance to date.\n\nAussie Broadband reports evening speeds of 86Mbps on NBN 100 plans, 43Mbps on NBN 50 plans, and 22Mbps on NBN 25 plans.\n\nVodafone\n\nVodafone is new to the NBN game, but already seems to be doing a great job at delivering on speed. The standout is its NBN 50 plan, for which the company reports typical evening speeds of 45Mbps. That's pretty much the fastest evening speed for an NBN 50 plan.\n\nIn addition, Vodafone says NBN 100 customers will get evening speeds of 85Mbps, and NBN 25 customers will get evening speeds of 23Mbps.\n\nIf you're an existing Vodafone mobile customer, you can save between 5% and 20% on a Vodafone NBN plan by bundling it with your existing service.\n\nTangerine Telecom\n\nTangerine Telecom is a young NBN provider that's been making waves lately thanks to strong promotional offers and a 14-day risk free trial on its plans. Better yet, the company reports pretty decent evening speeds: 83Mbps on NBN 100 plans, 42Mbps on NBN 50 plans, and 21Mbps on NBN 25 plans.\n\niiNet\n\niiNet's peak hour performance has gotten a bit faster lately, with the telco now reporting evening speeds of 83.3Mbps on NBN 100 plans, 43.7Mbps on NBN 50 plans, and 20.38bps on NBN 25 plans.\n\nMyRepublic\n\nMyRepublic plans are a little priciey, but they\u2019re up there in terms of speeds. The telco says customers experience typical evening speeds of 83Mbps on NBN 100 plans, and 43Mbps on NBN 50 plans.\n\nTelstra\n\nTelstra reports fairly standard typical evening speeds - 80Mbps on NBN 100 plans, 40Mbps on NBN 50 plans, and 20Mbps on NBN 25 plans - but that's not all there is to the Big T NBN story. In addition to typical speeds, Telstra also provides average evening speeds, based on the performance of 90% of its NBN customers.\n\nWhile Telstra hasn't provided new measurements for a while, in July it said its NBN 100 customers were getting average evening speeds of 91.15Mbps, NBN 50 customers were getting 46.09Mbps, and NBN 25 customers were getting 23.34Mbps. These average speeds put Telstra ahead of the competition, which you'd hope to be the case given the company's premium pricing.\n\nTelstra's average speed reports exclude Fixed Wireless NBN customers, and all fixed line customers with a limited maximum line speed thanks to shitty copper.\n\nOptus\n\nMuch like Telstra, Optus' evening speeds seem pretty no frills at first: 80Mbps on NBN 100 plans, and 40Mbps on NBN 50 plans. But just like Big T, Optus also provides average peak evening speed information too.\n\nOptus' latest numbers come from September, claiming that NBN 100 customers were getting average evening speeds of 88.7Mbps and NBN 50 customers were getting 42.6Mbps. These speeds are calculated over a two-week period based on the experiences of a \"representative\" group of customers. As with Telstra, these average speeds put Optus pretty close to the front of the pack, at least when compared to the typical speeds reported by the rest of the industry.\n\nInternode\n\nTrusty old Internode. For the longest time, the name Internode has been synonymous with quality internet, and its average NBN evening speeds confirm that it is still an internet provider worthy of a closer look.\n\nInternode reports some of the industry\u2019s best NBN 50 evening speeds, coming in at 44.4Mbps. However, its NBN 100 evening speeds aren't quite as high, coming in at 78.6Mbps.\n\nTPG\n\nWhile TPG was once at the head of the pack when it came to peak hour NBN performance, it now reports fairly average speeds, at least when it comes to NBN 100 plans. TPG says customers can expect typical evening speeds of 78.2Mbps, down from close to 90Mbps a couple of months ago.\n\nTPG also reports evening speeds of 43.7Mbps on NBN 50 plans, and 11Mbps on NBN 12 plans.\n\nExetel\n\nExetel\u2019s evening speeds are pretty standard: 77Mbps on NBN 100 plans, and 40Mbps on NBN 50.\n\nAlex Choros is Managing Editor at WhistleOut, Australia's phone and internet comparison website.", "description": "Australia's NBN providers are constantly jockeying for the title of Fastest Plan.
