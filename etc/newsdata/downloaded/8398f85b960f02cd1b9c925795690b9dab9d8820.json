This particular group is simply one informal way phone companies can let each other know when they have been allocated blocks of numbers by Ofcon. This information remains available to phone companies through our website,\" the company said.\n\nOfcom added that if new phone number assignments are allocated to phone companies, Ofcom updates its \"site weekly with the allocation information, but we don't actively notify all of the phone companies as they're aware of the regular update schedule\".\n\nDespite this, there is a group on Yahoo Groups named Ofcom Number Activation Group that says it was established by Ofcom to \"allow communications providers that have been allocated telephone numbers by Ofcom, to contact each other for activation purposes\".\n\n\"Those who have been allocated telephone numbers are required to advise Ofcom of the contact in their organisations to whom notifications of the dates for activation of the allocated telephone numbers should be sent,\" the group description states.\n\n\"This group exists to maintain a list of those contacts and to make those contacts available to others who have need of that information.\"\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nFormer Yahoo engineer pleads guilty to hacking user emails in search for porn\n\nFormer Yahoo engineer accessed about 6,000 email accounts, primarily belonging to young women.\n\nYahoo data breach settlement effort reaches $117.5 million\n\n$50 million was too low for one of the largest data breaches on record.\n\nAltaba to sell remaining Alibaba shares and shut down\n\nThe remaining Alibaba shares are expected to generate around $40 billion for Altaba stockholders.\n\nYahoo agrees to pay $50 million to settle data breach lawsuit\n\nThe company will also provide free credit monitoring services to roughly 200 million people impacted by the cyberattacks.", "description": "Users will now have until October 28 before Yahoo stops new content from being uploaded onto Yahoo Groups.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/15/f74975db-470a-465d-af52-b234b66c8e35/thumbnail/770x578/284dd8e2c82579029d88135c7b1b2e96/yahoo-535059009.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
