REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nThe case was adjourned until Nov. 19 after prosecutors said they needed more time to study 35 hours of video, including police, online and CCTV footage. The 44 defendants were to be released on bail, lawyers said.\n\nPolice clashed with thousands of protesters in the former British colony on July 28 as they sought to defend the Hong Kong Liaison Office, a symbol of Chinese rule, from the crowds. Officers fired tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge grenades.\n\nThe mostly young activists in hard hats and gas masks dismantled street signs and fences which they used to form makeshift barricades to slow police advances. This is now a common tactic, met by the same response, almost every weekend.\n\nA week earlier, on July 21, they had daubed slogans on the walls of the Liaison Office and thrown paint bombs at it.\n\nViolence has hit parts of the former British colony at different times over the last three months, but life goes on as normal most of the time.\n\nBut pictures of petrol bombs and street clashes broadcast worldwide present a huge embarrassment for Beijing before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1.\n\nFIVE DEMANDS\n\nThe protesters are furious at what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina says it is committed to the arrangement and denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain of inciting the unrest.\n\nThe protesters have five demands - the scrapping of now-withdrawn legislation that would have allowed extraditions to China, retraction of the word \u201criot\u201d to describe the rallies, the release of all detained demonstrators, an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leader.\n\nThe charges on Wednesday, apart from rioting, included one of possessing an offensive weapon in a public place and several of assaulting police. The defendants are yet to make their pleas.\n\nThe publisher of Hong Kong\u2019s Apple Daily, controlled by pro-democracy tycoon and Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, on Wednesday condemned an assault on one of its reporters by unknown assailants at a restaurant.
