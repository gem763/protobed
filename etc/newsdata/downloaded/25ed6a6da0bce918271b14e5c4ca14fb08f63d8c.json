Since then, however, the oil markets have slipped and been unable to regain traction. On the international market, Brent crude is down 19.6% from its April 23 peak, while the US benchmark WTI has slipped 20.8%.\n\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist, sees a possible near-term turnaround in the oil markets, however. He writes, \u201cWe believe favorable technicals, improving fundamentals with stabilizing business cycle, and ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could help redirect flows into this universally hated and cheap sector.\u201d In short, the industry has a solid business foundation, while political instability may act to push prices back up. He adds three additional factors that point toward a bullish future for oil. First, the low prices have pushed oil stocks to discount valuations; second, many oil companies are working to lure investors with increased dividends; and third, the US economy shows signs of picking up in the next three to six months.\n\nBased on this bullish thesis, we\u2019ve used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener to pick out three energy stocks with Strong Buy consensus ratings. All three have weathered the low prices and are ready take advantage of any upturn in the oil markets.\n\nCabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Cabot, the smallest of today\u2019s stock picks. The company has a market cap of $7.4 billion, and is focused on the Marcellus shale formation of the Appalachian region. Cabot controls 11.6 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves in northeast Pennsylvania. For a mid-size company, this is a large asset in a strategic location of a high-demand area. Cabot has drilled over 650 wells in the last 10 years.\n\nNatural gas is a prime fuel for electrical generation as well as home heating and cooking, so Cabot\u2019s product has no want of customers. The company reported 2018 net income of $100 million on revenues of $1.76 billion. While overhead in the gas drilling and fracking business is high, Cabot has sufficient cash flow to maintain a 9-cent per quarter dividend payment, which annualizes at 36 cents and a 2.05% yield. The company has been raising that dividend steadily over the past two years.\n\nCabot\u2019s solid position in the US natural gas industry earned it an upgrade from 5-star Wolfe Research analyst Josh Silverstein. Silverstein changed his stance from Neutral to Buy, writing, \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the sidelines at COG looking for a better entry point\u2026 With the stock now -20% over the last three months\u2026, we see an improved risk/reward and opportunity to own one of the best low-cost asset bases\u2026\u201d In upgrading his stance on the stock, Silverstein maintained his $27 price target, indicating confidence in a 53% upside to the shares.\n\nOverall, COG\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating comes from 8 reviews, including 6 \"buys\" and 2 \"holds,\" given in the past three months. The stock is selling for a low $17.59, but the $23.14 average price target suggests a potential of nearly 30% upside. (See Cabot Oil & Gas stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nDiamondback Energy (FANG)\n\nDiamondback is a major producer of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, all in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Diamondback has over 992 million barrels of proven reserves available for recovering in this rich oil basin, of which 63% is petroleum and the remainder split between various forms of natural gas products. These reserves justify the company\u2019s $13.7 billion market cap.", "description": "Oil prices bottomed out last December and rose steadily through the first four months of this year.
