The win was driven in large part by Masahiro Tanaka, who ended his night with six innings of one-hit ball, as well as Gleyber Torres, whose highlight reel included a home run and five RBI over the course of five at-bats.\n\nDespite some fine pitching from Houston starter Zack Greinke \u2014 three runs, zero walks, and six strikeouts over six innings \u2014 the Yankees didn\u2019t give the Astros many opportunities to rest. After three scoreless innings, Torres put the Yankees on the board with a fourth-inning RBI double, and returned in the sixth with a 343-foot home run that was quickly followed by another 406-footer from Giancarlo Stanton.\n\nIn the seventh, Torres tacked on another pair of runs with a two-RBI single to center field, then advanced to second base on a throwing error from George Springer. During the bottom half of the inning, it looked as though the Astros were finally ready to mount a rally, but a would-be RBI single from Alex Bregman reverted to an inning-ending double play after the replay revealed he was out at first base.\n\nNot content to simply carry a five-run lead across the finish line, the Yankees returned in the ninth for another two runs against Houston reliever Bryan Abreu. Gio Urshela led off with a first-pitch home run, which was followed by a productive groundout from \u2014 who else? \u2014 Torres.\n\nThe Astros\u2019 loss marked their first such defeat at Minute Maid Park this postseason (and their first loss at home since September 21). They\u2019ll get the chance to rectify things during Sunday\u2019s pitcher\u2019s duel, when they\u2019ll send lefty James Paxton up against the Yankees\u2019 Justin Verlander for Game 2 of the ALCS at 8:08 PM EDT.", "description": "Torres went 3-for-5 with five RBI during the Yankees' triumphant 7-0 victory over the Astros on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nbchardballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1180706012-e1570937331903.jpg?w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
