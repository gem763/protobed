Neil will commence a detailed handover with performance staff until his departure and will fulfil his role supporting Mo Farah at this weekend\u2019s Chicago marathon.\u201d\n\nBlack revealed on Monday that he was considering his position following Salazar\u2019s four-year ban for doping offences. Black is not implicated in any wrongdoing but his judgment has come under question because of his unstinting support for Salazar, who coached Farah for nearly seven years and was a British Athletics consultant until 2017.\n\nSpeaking for the first time since Salazar was banned, Black said: \u201cI\u2019ll be personally reviewing thoughts that I had, the decisions I\u2019ve made, the things that I\u2019ve said. Having done that thoroughly, patiently, sensibly, I\u2019ll come to my own decision and that will run in parallel with discussions with UKA chair Chris Clark and the board.\u201d\n\nOf Farah, who has always denied any wrongdoing, Black said: \u201cNothing at all has changed in terms of my belief regarding Mo Farah. I think it is important to repeat that the British Athletics medical and support teams were always the people who were always on top of, and managing and directing the care of Mo Farah, so we have no concerns.\u201d", "description": "Neil Black is to stand down as UK Athletics performance director at the end of October, the governing body has announced", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/Black.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fdce5b4b8f98f5fb6def168a5e6c6d70", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
