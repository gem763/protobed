FAA Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell said last month that if the AOA sensors differ by 5.5 degrees or more then MCAS cannot operate. If MCAS does operate it can only operate once unless the problem had been \u201ccompletely resolved,\u201d he added.", "description": "WASHINGTON/SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - An international panel of air safety regulators on Friday harshly criticized the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) review of a safety system on Boeing Co's 737 MAX jet that was later tied to two crashes that killed 346 people.
