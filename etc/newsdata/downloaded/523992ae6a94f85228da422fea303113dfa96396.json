USA TODAY\n\nNow that everyone\u2019s back to reality and calmed down after Chaotic Saturday in the Big 12, what\u2019s it all mean after four favorites lost?\n\nIt means that Baylor, which escaped the madness while not even playing Saturday, is the league\u2019s lone unbeaten.\n\nIt means that Oklahoma, which lost against a Kansas State team that gets more surprising as the season progresses, still isn\u2019t out of the hunt for a spot in the College Football Playoffs.\n\nLet\u2019s say the Sooners don\u2019t lose again. Let\u2019s say Lincoln Riley\u2019s team beats Iowa State, Baylor, TCU and Oklahoma State to finish 8-1 in the league. Again, let\u2019s assume they beat whomever they play in the Big 12 title game.\n\nBaylor safety Henry Black (8) breaks up a pass intended for Oklahoma State tight end Logan Carter during the second half at Boone Pickens Stadium. (Photo: Rob Ferguson, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nDoes a 12-1 Oklahoma get invited to college football\u2019s final four?\n\nIt\u2019d be an interesting discussion among the College Football Playoff committee, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nHere we go with another round of the USA TODAY Network\u2019s Big 12 power rankings.\n\nNo. 1 Baylor (7-0, 4-0 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 2\n\nLast game: Idle.\n\nIn a nutshell: An unbeaten Baylor \u2014 that\u2019d be 13-0 \u2014 makes the College Football Playoff. That\u2019s reality. What we don\u2019t know is the likelihood of Matt Rhule\u2019s team finishing the regular season unscathed. Thursday night, the Bears host West Virginia. After that, they\u2019re at TCU, and then there\u2019s consecutive home games against Oklahoma and Texas, before finishing the regular season at Kansas.\n\nOn deck: Thursday vs. West Virginia, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nRE-RANK: Oklahoma falls to No. 9 and the American Athletic shows strength\n\nTIGERS MOVE UP: LSU now No. 2 behind Alabama in Amway Coaches poll\n\nNo. 2 Oklahoma (7-1, 4-1 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s rating: 1\n\nLast game: Lost to Kansas State 48-41.\n\nIn a nutshell: Here\u2019s the deal: If the Sooners win the rest of their games, do they get into the College Football Playoff ahead of a second team from the Big Ten or SEC? That\u2019ll shake out on Dec. 8, but this much is certain \u2013 Oklahoma\u2019s first true road game loss since 2014 was a doozie. After a week off, Iowa State invades Norman, Oklahoma, and for both teams, the stakes will be monumental.\n\nOn deck: Nov. 9 vs. Iowa State.\n\nNo. 3 Kansas State (5-2, 2-2 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s rating: 5\n\nLast game: Defeated Oklahoma 48-41.\n\nIn a nutshell: Check out the rest of the schedule \u2014 at Kansas, at Texas, home against West Virginia, at Texas Tech and at home against Iowa State. See anything there that\u2019s more daunting than what Chris Klieman\u2019s team did last Saturday? The mission now is to keep all Wildcats emotionally grounded.\n\nOn deck: Saturday at Kansas, 3:30 p.m. ET, FS1.\n\nNo. 4 Texas (5-3, 3-2 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s rating: 3\n\nLast game: Lost to TCU 37-27.\n\nIn a nutshell: Saturday was going to be tough, anyway, for quarterback Sam Ehlinger, but four interceptions? He came into the game with just three this season. It\u2019s still possible for the Longhorns to make the Big 12 title game, although they face Iowa State and Baylor back-to-back on the road. There\u2019s also a Nov. 9 home game against giant-killer Kansas State.\n\nOn deck: Nov. 9 vs. Kansas State.\n\nNo. 5 Oklahoma State (5-3, 2-3 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s rating: 6\n\nLast game: Defeated Iowa State 34-27.\n\nIn a nutshell: There wasn\u2019t anything too fancy about intercepting three Brock Purdy passes during the game\u2019s final 7 minutes. Cluster defenders in the middle of the field. Force the sophomore to pass into double- and sometimes triple coverage. He\u2019d done it all day, and there was no reason to believe he\u2019d stop. The fancy stuff was a screen pass that Tylan Wallace turned into a 71-yard touchdown, a 50-yard scoring screen pass to Braydon Johnson, and Chuba Hubbard\u2019s 65-yard scoring bust through the heart of the defense.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. TCU at 3:30 p.m. ET, ESPN.\n\nNo. 6 Iowa State (5-3, 3-2 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s rating: 4\n\nLast game: Lost to Oklahoma State 34-27.\n\nIn a nutshell: Iowa State looked like Iowa State of old at times during this loss \u2013 shabby tackling on long runs, and a plethora of interceptions. There\u2019s no sugar-coating the fallout of what happened at Jack Trice Stadium: Matt Campbell\u2019s team must win its remaining four regular-season games if it hopes to play in the Big 12 championship game.\n\nOn deck: Nov. 9 at Oklahoma.\n\nNo. 7 TCU (4-3, 2-2 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s rating: 7\n\nLast game: Defeated Texas 37-27.\n\nIn a nutshell: Did Saturday\u2019s outcome really surprise anyone? TCU coach Gary Patterson has beaten Texas six times during the past eight times they\u2019ve played. \u201cIt helps me if I beat Texas; I can usually keep my job longer in this state,\u201d Patterson told reporters after the game. \u201cIt helps me.\u201d\n\nOn deck: Saturday at Oklahoma State, 3:30 p.m. ET, ESPN.\n\nNo. 8 Kansas (3-5, 1-4 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s rating: 10\n\nLast game: Defeated Texas Tech 37-34.\n\nIn a nutshell: Coach Les Miles waited too long to replace offensive coordinator Les Koenning with Brent Dearmon. First, it was a 48-point explosion during his first game in a two-point loss against Texas, and last Saturday, it was drawing up a successful offense against Texas Tech.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. Kansas State, 3:30 p.m. ET, FS1.\n\nNo. 9 West Virginia (3-4, 1-3 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s rating: 8\n\nLast game: Idle.\n\nIn a nutshell: A three-game losing streak just got worse. Suddenly what looked like possibly a comfy final four games isn\u2019t so comfy. The Mountaineers\u2019 November schedule includes games at Kansas State, at home against Oklahoma State, at TCU \u2013 after playing Thursday at Baylor.\n\nOn deck: Thursday at Baylor at 8 p.m. ET, ESPN.\n\nNo. 10 Texas Tech (3-5, 1-4 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s rating: 9\n\nLast game: Lost to Kansas 37-34.\n\nIn a nutshell: Where\u2019s this program headed, after losing against Kansas? Five losses out of the past six games, including four out of five against the Big 12, has to have Red Raider fans wondering.\n\nOn deck: Nov. 9 at West Virginia.", "description": "A Saturday that saw Oklahoma and other favorites loss has shaken up the Big 12 power rankings.
