Because of the difficulties of visiting the camps, and because Beijing downplays their existence, firsthand information is sparse. However, satellite photos, innovative research on government procurement bids, and excellent reporting by foreign journalists prove their existence. Some inmates are tortured. Others are forced to sit for hours singing songs praising the ruling Chinese Communist Party.\n\nFor the region\u2019s Muslims, most of whom belong to a Turkic-speaking minority known as Uighurs, the violations extend beyond imprisonment. Uighurs in Xinjiang can\u2019t wear veils or \u201cabnormal\u201d beards. In late 2017, Chinese authorities reportedly ordered them to relinquish prayer mats and Qurans. It\u2019s difficult for Uighurs to leave their homes without omnipresent police scanning their faces with dystopian accuracy, ostensibly as part of the hunt for \u201cterrorists.\u201d Police require them to install an app\u2014whose name translates to \u201cweb cleansing\u201d\u2014on their phones that alerts local authorities to \u201cdangerous\u201d content. They can\u2019t even own certain types of knives without registering them because of fears they will use them for violence. On Aug. 10, a member of a United Nations human rights panel condemned Beijing for turning the region into a \u201csort of \u2018no rights zone.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe NBA can\u2019t continue to help China whitewash a network of concentration camps.\n\nDoing business in an authoritarian country like China inevitably presents ethical and political dilemmas, as several tech giants and airlines have recently learned. But doing business right in the midst of a campaign that some human rights groups have described as genocide is another thing entirely\u2014and most U.S. companies have unsurprisingly given Xinjiang a wide berth. Yet one of the exceptions is striking: the National Basketball Association. In Oct. 2016, the NBA set up one of its three Chinese training centers in, of all places, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, the capital of Xinjiang and site of massive race riots in 2009 that left hundreds dead. The center, which houses roughly 240 student-athletes ages 14 to 18, according to its website, has kept a very low profile. That\u2019s unsurprising\u2014because the NBA presence in Xinjiang is shameful.\n\nOver the past few years, Xinjiang has become ground zero for a repressive revolution into a total control state. Think less George Orwell and more Michel Foucault, the philosopher of power who described a system of total control as a \u201ccruel, ingenious cage.\u201d Shoppers often must allow their faces to be scanned just to enter markets around the vast region. Passing through dozens of checkpoints on an April trip to Xinjiang, the American Ph.D. student Darren Byler was struck by the casual racism. Uighurs were required to scan their IDs and faced far longer lines and police harassment. Han Chinese\u2014who make up roughly 92 percent of China\u2019s population, and roughly half of Xinjiang\u2019s population of 22 million\u2014did not. \u201cDuring my entire trip, I did not see a Han individual produce his or her ID, or even pause for a moment to wonder if they should,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOperating in such a place seems antithetical to the public stance of a league that has recently gone out of its way to tout its progressive, social-justice bona fides. After the Trump travel ban targeting seven Muslim-majority nations, prominent NBA figures took the side of the critics. League commissioner Adam Silver took the unusual step of criticizing the ban, saying \u201cit goes against the fundamental values and the fundamental ingredients of what makes for a great NBA.\u201d Detroit Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy compared the ban to Hitler registering the Jews.\n\nNBA stars like LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony have condemned police violence and racism in the United States, while players and executives have protested the Trump administration\u2019s separation of immigrant children from their parents. According to his LinkedIn page, the NBA executive George Land oversees the Xinjiang training center. On Twitter, Land\u2019s most recent activity is a retweet of the MSNBC host Chris Hayes condemning the U.S. separation of thousands of mothers from their children. But what about Xinjiang? Thousands of Uighur children are reportedly languishing in orphanages, awaiting their parents\u2019 release from the concentration camps. The NBA didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Nor did Land. Nor did China\u2019s foreign ministry. (In a response to the recent United Nations report, a senior Chinese official denied the reports of torture and persecution of Uighurs and said that the camps were for \u201ccriminals involved only in minor offenses,\u201d to teach them vocational skills.)\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to figure out the motives of the NBA. China, with its market of 1.4 billion potential fans, offers great hope for basketball\u2019s future, and Beijing presumably approves of the league\u2019s willingness to work in Xinjiang\u2014both because it helps bring development to a relatively poor region and because it helps legitimize the repression against Uighurs. The league and its stars are phenomenally popular throughout the country, including Xinjiang. Zhou Qi, the only Chinese player in the NBA last season, formerly played for the region\u2019s team, the Xinjiang Flying Tigers. A number of prominent NBA players including Patty Mills, Kenyon Martin, and Jordan Crawford have also spent time on that team.\n\nBut the NBA should no longer engage with Xinjiang. Yes, it will offend some Chinese fans, and Chinese sports regulators might make it more difficult to bring NBA games to a Chinese audience. But the alternative is to continue to help China whitewash a network of concentration camps.\n\nRetired Lakers star Kobe Bryant, still one of the most popular players in China, said on a September 2017 visit to China that watching NBA games as a child \u201cinspired me to dream and helped me become creative. I\u2019m very excited that the kids here also have that same opportunity.\u201d\n\nGood for the NBA for encouraging Chinese kids to dream. Now it\u2019s time to stop turning a blind eye to Muslim kids\u2019 nightmares.", "description": "It\u2019s time for the league to leave China\u2019s Xinjiang region.", "authors": ["Isaac Stone Fish"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/23a9fe11-b099-40f8-8b6f-c2e58300076d.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0", "published_at": "2018-08-20"}
