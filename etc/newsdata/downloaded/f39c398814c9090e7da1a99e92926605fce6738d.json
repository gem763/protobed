We also have to redress the past 25 years of ANC governments.\n\nOne story, above all else, paints this picture for me.\n\nIn 2016, on a visit to Alexandra, I met a young woman. She took my delegation to see where she lived.\n\nI noticed there was no toilet facility and asked her how she lived like this.\n\nHer response still haunts me: \u201cI have trained my body to only require the toilet when I am at my place of work.\u201d\n\nThis is why we have to recognise that South Africa is the most unequal society in the world today.\n\nWe cannot afford to dwell on this with a sense of defeatism; we have to fix it.\n\nWhen I took office in Johannesburg in August 2016, I committed the multiparty government to a pro-poor agenda.\n\nThis does not mean we must choose between the rich and the poor. That kind of thinking with a budgeted R65 billion city would be simplistic.\n\nWhat it means is that we have to be part of a project, rich and poor, which both recognises that the status quo is not sustainable and supports efforts to remedy the situation.\n\nMy experiences in meeting with South Africans and Joburgers across the spectrum is that they all understand this.\n\nIt is, in fact, politicians who do not.\n\nRead: Alex inquiry seeks to find a solution for disgruntled residents\n\nThis is why we set about changing the work of government in Johannesburg.\n\nWe cut back on non-essential, wasteful expenditure and reprioritised billions towards those who needed it most.\n\nWe were able to increase budgets for informal settlement upgrades tenfold in a short time.\n\nNow, more than 10 informal settlements are being electrified each year.\n\nThe city is on track for every household in an informal settlement to have access to toilets and piped water.\n\nPart of redressing the legacy of the past means tackling our spatial inequality, which has forced people to live on the periphery of our city and spend 50% of their household income on public transport.\n\nThe inner city project is key \u2013 we have to move away from housing people far away from opportunities.\n\nIt is all about taking people out of the abusive relationship with criminal slumlords and getting the private sector to convert these buildings into low-cost, affordable housing of a world standard.\n\nFor this, they will end up paying much the same as they were paying slumlords to live in conditions not fit for a human being.\n\nTo date, with an estimated 643 bad buildings, 139 properties have been awarded to developers to cater for the missing middle \u2013 those who are too rich to qualify for free government housing but cannot get bonds.\n\nIt will generate R32 billion in investment, create over 12 000 construction jobs and house more than 7 000 families.\n\nPart of redressing the legacy of the past means tackling our spatial inequality, which has forced people to live on the periphery of our city and spend 50% of their household income on public transport Herman Mashaba\n\nWe have established substance abuse facilities in communities where the legacy of hopelessness has generated terrible addiction levels.\n\nAnd we have extended operating hours for clinics, 26 of them to date, so that those who are seeking work opportunities do not have to choose between work and healthcare.\n\n\n\nWe have changed the city\u2019s policy of water allowances that used to offer six kilolitres of water to everyone, rich and poor.\n\nNow, only those below a certain household income can receive this benefit. They receive up to 15 kilolitres of free water every month.\n\nWe have initiated a pilot project to offer pensioners and persons with disabilities free bus rides across the city.\n\nOur approach to insourcing security guards and cleaners has brought dignity to more than 7 000 families.\n\nBy removing the abusive tenderpreneur \u201cmiddle-men\u201d and employing these individuals directly, they earn 50% to 100% more, and enjoy employment benefits.\n\nWhile I am proud of these measures, the reality is that we need a growing economy that creates jobs and takes more families out of poverty.\n\nWe have opened opportunity centres in Joburg, offering incubation services and supporting small business owners.\n\nSmall businesses must be the future of our economic growth and job creation.\n\nWe need a government which does not steal public money, one which prioritises the pro-poor agenda and partners with its citizenry and the private sector to wage war on inequality.\n\nIn doing so, we will achieve the kind of change that will deliver the society we all imagined in 1994.\n\nMashaba is the mayor of Joburg", "description": "To redress apartheid  we have to tackle all forms of inequality and support small business, writes Herman Mashaba.", "authors": ["Herman Mashaba"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8124/a479ccdd16d44479aeacea4c891cedc6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
