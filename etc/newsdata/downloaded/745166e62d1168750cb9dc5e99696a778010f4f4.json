Britain\u2019s State Opening of Parliament, and the Queen\u2019s Speech that accompanies it, is nothing if not extravagant\u2014an event more so than any other in British politics that is beholden to ritual and tradition.\n\nFor a ceremony replete with colorful customs, however, this year\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech couldn\u2019t have come at a more untraditional time for Britain. Politically, the government has no majority, an election is imminent (though no one knows when), and the country is careening toward a cliff-edge exit from the European Union, without a withdrawal agreement to cushion the fall. And on a deeper level, major constitutional questions are suddenly up for debate, from the strength and sovereignty of Parliament to the power of the executive and the role of the monarch in relation to the legislature.\n\nIt was against this tumultuous backdrop that Queen Elizabeth II made the short journey from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster today to deliver her ceremonial address outlining the government\u2019s legislative agenda for the new parliamentary year. From the elaborate costumes and royal regalia to the theatrical nodding, the Queen\u2019s Speech looks nothing like the Westminster politics that can be streamed online most days of the week. For one, it takes place not in the House of Commons, but across the palace, in the less observed House of Lords. And though the words are drafted by the government, they are delivered by the queen, who, donning an 18-foot crimson Robe of State, addresses lawmakers from a gilded throne. (Though the Imperial State Crown is always present for the ceremony, the queen hasn\u2019t worn it in recent years because of its weight. \u201cYou can\u2019t look down to read the speech,\u201d the queen told the BBC last year, \u201cbecause if you did, your neck would break.\u201d)\n\nBut even the pomp and pageantry of today\u2019s event couldn\u2019t overshadow all the political controversy surrounding it. After all, it was only last month that Prime Minister Boris Johnson stood accused of lying to the queen about his original bid to suspend Parliament (an otherwise usual move made controversial by its unusually long duration), which was later ruled unlawful by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court. That the country is just weeks away from its October 31 Brexit deadline and likely headed for a general election (which could prompt yet another Queen\u2019s Speech) led several lawmakers to declare the State Opening a \u201csham.\u201d", "description": "The State Opening of Parliament and the accompanying Queen\u2019s Speech are steeped in ritual and custom, something that feels incongruous as the country grapples with chaos.", "authors": ["Yasmeen Serhan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2R2X5/facebook.jpg?1571058222", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
