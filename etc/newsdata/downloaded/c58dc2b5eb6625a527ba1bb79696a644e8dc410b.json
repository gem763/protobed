(AP) \u2014 Sheryl Crow has a lifetime of stories of hanging out with rock stars, pop stars, athletes, icons and music royalty, some even featured on her new collaborative record, but don\u2019t expect her to start revealing any secrets in an autobiography.\n\n\u201cI mean, there are certain people that would have to die first in order for me to tell the real story,\u201d Crow said in a one-room church she had built on her property in Nashville, Tennessee, that houses a strange and eclectic collection of religious-themed statues, crosses, antique dolls, mirrors and stained glass.\n\nHer laughter echoed in the tall ceiling and then she felt bad about saying that aloud.\n\n\u201cThat is terrible. I did not say that,\u201d Crow said.\n\nThe Grammy-winning Crow does have rock \u2018n\u2019 roll secrets, but she\u2019s happy to keep some of them squirreled away like the antiques in that building.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived them and I love being able to reflect on them, but I don\u2019t know that I feel the need to share them with the world,\u201d Crow said.\n\nIf Crow is feeling a bit reflective about her lengthy career, it\u2019s because she\u2019s at a turning point, both looking backward at all those musical icons that inspired her and trying to uplift a new generation especially female rockers. \u201cThreads,\u201d out last Friday, features more than 20 other artists, including Keith Richards, Neil Young, Maren Morris, Stevie Nicks, St. Vincent, Sting and Eric Clapton.\n\nCrow said it is her last full-length album and she feels \u201cliberated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel pretty good about this being my farewell to making full-length albums,\u201d Crow said.\n\nCrow broke out in the heyday of CDs and rock radio, but over the course of her career digital downloads and then streaming has tanked both formats. She\u2019s accepting of that inevitability, even if she thinks it has hurt artists like herself who have been making music for generations.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put the toothpaste back in the tube,\u201d Crow said.\n\nCrow\u2019s album feels like a star-studded farewell tour, where she reunites with some of the best guitarists still living. Clapton tributes his late friend George Harrison on \u201cBeware of Darkness,\u201d with Crow, Sting and Brandi Carlile trading verses. She reunited with Richards, who she met when the Rolling Stones asked her to play with them in the 1990s, on a cover of \u201cThe Worst,\u201d and Bonnie Raitt\u2019s slide guitar matches up with Mavis Staples\u2019 soulful vocals on \u201cLive Wire.\u201d\n\n\u201cRock is not dead. Guitar playing is still cool,\u201d Crow said. \u201cI was a rock kid. I wanted to be in the Rolling Stones but I wanted to be Keith.\u201d\n\nProducer and drummer Steve Jordan, who plays in Richards\u2019 solo band as well as the John Mayer Trio and won a Grammy for producing \u201cContinuum,\u201d said that he and Crow tried as much as possible to be in the studio with the guest artists during recording, including with Chris Stapleton on \u201cTell Me When It\u2019s Over,\u201d with Jason Isbell on Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cEverything is Broken,\u201d and with Joe Walsh on \u201cStill the Good Ole Days.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made for a more personal approach,\u201d said Jordan.\n\nHe said that while Crow does have a lot of famous friends, the album not a reflection of her Rolodex, but of her impressive career and the friendships she\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cThe whole concept was people that she loves,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t be a Sheryl Crow record if she didn\u2019t use the opportunity to speak her mind about the state of the world. Jordan suggested bringing Chuck D, one of rap\u2019s politically and socially conscious pioneers, on a song called \u201cStory of Everything,\u201d also featuring Andra Day and Gary Clark Jr., that touches on everything from the Charleston church shooting, Congress and economic inequality across the country.\n\n\u201cThis is the story of a lot of small towns in America,\u201d Crow said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely happening in my small town where a lot of the large corporations, the factories, have all moved out.\u201d\n\nCrow will still be recording and putting out music and touring, but not be tied to the structure and time demands of an album. But she also wants to explore her non-musical interests as well.\n\n\u201cThe environment to me has always been my main passion,\u201d said Crow. \u201cI want to be more involved with philanthropic work. So we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m at a point where I am OK with not knowing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: http://www.sherylcrow.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sheryl Crow has a lifetime of stories of hanging out with rock stars, pop stars, athletes, icons and music royalty, some even featured on her new collaborative record, but don't expect her to start revealing any secrets in an autobiography.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristin M.
