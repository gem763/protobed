It is already being dubbed as \u201cDavos with the poor\u201d.\n\nSocial entrepreneur Kennedy Odede, who was raised in the slum of Kibera, in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has founded the event to bring world leaders and policymakers together to \u201cchange the dynamic\u201d of the way the big global issues are discussed. He said it was about making \u201cworlds collide\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is high time that the policymakers come to us, the people and the communities who are doing great work on the ground,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cMeetings like Davos are all very well, to bring together world leaders, but there is no space for them to interact with the poor and with people doing the work in the communities. So this forum will fill this gap.\u201d\n\nThe forum is designed to tackle world poverty by reversing the often unequal power dynamics of development conferences, and will take place in January. It will be that rare example, said Odede, of a conference choosing its location to give a real voice to the poorest in finding solutions to their own problems.\n\n\u201cWe will have a 50/50 split of influential leaders and of community leaders from Kibera, from Africa, from India, from Brazil, who have been left out of the conversations for too long.\n\n\u201cThis is not about people helicoptering in. They will come with humility, they will come in as our guest and we will showcase all the things people in Kibera can teach the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is meant to be a learning journey \u2013 what is working, what is not working. We can learn from each other when the community get a voice.\n\n\u201cPeople on the frontline must be included. They have to have a place at the table.\n\n\u201cThey have been left out of the decisions made about them. Why? Because it\u2019s all been about top to bottom. Now it has to be about bottom to top, because inequality is growing too much. We need to fight this.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited. This is for me a big step. We will be a bridge between real people and policymakers.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Founder of the World Poverty Forum, Kennedy Odede.

We will bring leaders to a place where they can feel both the unforgiving reality of poverty alongside the hope that an institution like Shofco can create.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Women cook fish to sell to passersby in one of the main streets of Kibera. Photograph: Kate Holt/The Guardian\n\n\u201cThe World Poverty Forum will spark new ideas through worlds colliding, bringing together leading politicians, CEOs, NGOs, entrepreneurs and thinkers, with those who are making things happen on the frontline, in the thick of the community \u2013 rather than in a western five-star hotel.\n\n\u201cWe want to reverse the usual power dynamics of development conferences and release the energies that genuine collaboration can bring.\u201d\n\nA two-day programme will focus on practical solutions to the issues of health, education, conflict and climate crisis that keep people entrenched in poverty. Delegates will visit projects in Kibera as well as attending \u201cHacking Poverty\u201d seminars that look for simple solutions to everyday hardships. It will also celebrate pioneers in the global fight against poverty \u2013 from individuals and tech startups to NGOs and corporations \u2013 with the launch of the first Kibera Awards.\n\nThe event will hire local photographers, video crews, caterers and musicians and hold the daytime events in the Shofco school inside Kibera. The contribution of local people\u2019s talents is intended as a reminder to delegates that there are rich pools of skill, flair and inventiveness in the world\u2019s poorest communities.\n\nMore than 700 million people \u2013 10% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 live in extreme poverty \u2013 defined as earning less than $1.90 a day. While many regions are making good progress with poverty reduction, almost all of Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is off-track for ending extreme poverty. It is predicted 13 African countries will see an increase in the absolute numbers of extreme poor between now and 2030.\n\nMore than 1.3 billion people across the globe are described as \u201cmultidimensionally poor\u201d \u2013 defined by ways in which people experience deprivation beyond their income, such as health, education and the standard of living.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A young baby sits alone in Kibera.
