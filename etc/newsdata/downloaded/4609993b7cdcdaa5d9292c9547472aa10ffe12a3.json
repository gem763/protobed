Although there are exceptions, many students who transfer without degrees are allowed to play only after sitting out a year.\n\nFor this season, No. 4 Oklahoma, home of the last two Heisman Trophy winners, brought in Hurts, who spent three years at Alabama. No. 6 Louisiana State has Joe Burrow, and Mississippi State, Texas Christian and Maryland are among the teams that have entrusted their offenses to graduate transfers. When West Virginia goes to Missouri on Saturday, each team\u2019s first string is expected to include a degree-bearing quarterback: Kelly Bryant, formerly of Clemson, for Missouri; and Austin Kendall, who played at Oklahoma, for the Mountaineers.\n\n\u201cYou have to be invested in the program you\u2019re going to because these guys are taking a chance on you,\u201d Kendall, who predicted that the trend of graduate transfers would continue, said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nThe season\u2019s first weekend showed mixed performances for graduate transfer quarterbacks. Bryant\u2019s 423 passing yards accounted for close to 80 percent of Missouri\u2019s offense in a humiliating loss at Wyoming. Kendall was responsible for an even greater share of West Virginia\u2019s yards when it beat James Madison .\n\nTommy Stevens, who moved to Mississippi State from Penn State, used his first career start to throw for 236 yards and two touchdowns. Arkansas\u2019s graduate transfers, Ben Hicks and Nick Starkel, mustered just 191 passing yards against Portland State, and Riley Neal of Vanderbilt did not even make it to triple-digit yardage.\n\nBut Hurts \u2014 and there is perhaps no current player whose highs and lows have been more public \u2014 used Sunday night\u2019s game against Houston to open a viable Heisman campaign. He passed for 332 yards and rushed for 176 , assembling a personal record for total offense. His first possession as a Sooner lasted all of three plays, ending with a touchdown throw.\n\n\u201cPlaying at a school like Alabama and playing at a school like Oklahoma, there ain\u2019t many people in the world who can say they\u2019ve done that,\u201d Hurts, seemingly averse to the spotlight, said softly after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s just all unprecedented, but I\u2019m focused on the now. We\u2019re focused on the now.\u201d", "description": "About a dozen Power Five teams, including powers like Oklahoma and Louisiana State, are rolling with graduate transfers at quarterback.
