It\u2019s also a handy analogy for the many ups and downs they\u2019ve faced in their almost 40 years together, and yet they\u2019re still going strong.\n\nRelated: How we stay together: therapy and de-stressing in the garden\n\nThe British-born couple met in Salisbury when they were both 18 years old and Sarah was a student nurse. One night, she and her friends met a group of \u201clikely lads\u201d, including Mark, at the pub. \u201cI fancied him like mad, he was yummy,\u201d she says. Mark was out with the boys, \u201csmashed\u201d and somewhat oblivious, but Sarah was smitten.\n\nEvery night for the next fortnight she dragged her friends around all the local pubs in the hope of running into Mark. One night she bumped into him. He was out with friends and they all ended up back at someone\u2019s house to watch that fateful Clint Eastwood western. \u201cAnd he gave me this really lovely kiss and that was it, I had my hooks into him,\u201d she says today with a laugh.\n\nThe two were soon spending much of their time together. Sarah was madly in love with Mark, who was her first real boyfriend, although she had \u201ca bit of a meltdown\u201d at one point. She\u2019d been brought up in a strict Christian family where sex before marriage, especially with someone who wasn\u2019t religious, was frowned upon.\n\nThey split up for about a fortnight but were soon reunited. Sarah remembers wondering whether she could live with him and any of his annoying habits. \u201cIt comes back to that [question] if I feel like I need to change him, then he\u2019s not the right one for me. I never felt that.\u201d It still holds true, she says. \u201cAll the usual stuff like leaving the loo seat up or the wet towels on the floor \u2026 but he\u2019s got way more stuff that I love about him.\u201d\n\nFor Mark, it was simpler. \u201cI never ever thought \u2018what is love\u2019, \u2018am I in love?\u2019 I think it was about enjoying being together ... and with Sarah we were always doing things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was always about us and our friendship and enjoying life.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t an easy start. The two are from very different backgrounds: Mark was a kid from a council estate with working-class parents and Sarah\u2019s middle-class Christian parents did not approve. When Mark asked her parents if he could marry Sarah, they resisted. What should have been a happy day didn\u2019t end well, but it did help Sarah make a decision.\u201cI had this epiphany that if I wanted to be happy with Mark \u2013 and Mark was who I wanted to be with \u2013 we\u2019d just have to forge our own path.\u201d\n\nThey moved in together instead, and a few years later got married at a local registry office. Although both sets of parents came along, it was only when the couple\u2019s first child arrived that the family reconciled.\n\nIn 1996, the couple moved to New Zealand with their two children, then aged six and eight. It was a \u201chuge\u201d decision, which they didn\u2019t realise until they arrived. They settled in Gisborne, an isolated town in the North Island, planning to stay for a few years and see how things worked out. Then the New Zealand currency crashed and their savings halved, meaning a return to the UK was unlikely.\n\nThings became more difficult when they decided to move to Dunedin. While they tried to sell their Gisborne home, they rented in Dunedin. Mark was at his wits\u2019 end. \u201cIt was like we were burning money in the garden and in the end we were living off the credit card. The credit card was getting more and more near to maxing out and we just didn\u2019t have anything,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAt one time I remember that I said I\u2019m going to move back to England. If I had enough money on the credit card, I would\u2019ve gone back to England but we didn\u2019t. It was like, what do we do? I could\u2019ve asked my mother for money but they couldn\u2019t have afforded it, it would\u2019ve been deserting Sarah and the kids. [It was] like you\u2019re on the roof of your house and your house is on fire, what do you do?\u201d\n\nThe shared values around working hard, being authentic, being true to ourselves ... those things were core to us. Sarah Stewart\n\nHe ended up juggling three part-time jobs to make ends meet. Eventually they sold their Gisborne home and completed their move to Dunedin. They stuck together during those tough times, says Sarah, sometimes for quite practical reasons.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Mark and Sarah Stewart Wedding day Photograph: Sarah StewartNames: Sarah and Mark Stewart  Years together: 39  Occupations: Public servantsThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly isn\u2019t usually considered a romantic film, but for Sarah and husband Mark Stewart, it worked a treat.
