It appears in articles as a carousel of related stories, allowing readers to select the story that interests them and then quickly swipe through slides summarizing the story highlights.\n\nCohen said a Story Strip can be created by a publisher\u2019s editorial team, or Apester can automatically generate them based on an article. And because they can also include ads, this creates new monetization opportunities for publishers. In fact, Apester says TV Insider has seen its daily revenue double since the two companies started working together.\n\nAs for how these kinds of content widgets might fit in as publishers explore subscriptions and other business models beyond advertising, Cohen argued that even as business models change, \u201cthe blend is what\u2019s going to be important.\u201d\n\nAnd by allowing publishers to engage with users and collect data about their behavior, he said, \u201cApester is going to allow you to monetize all of [your audiences] differently \u2026 You can use the engagement that\u2019s happening and understand why it\u2019s happening in order to drive the right action.\u201d", "description": "Apester, which helps digital publishers add interactivity to their content, is rolling out a new format called the Story Strip.
