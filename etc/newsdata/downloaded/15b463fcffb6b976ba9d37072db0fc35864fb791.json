He also claimed there is a \u201clogical sequence\u201d to Labour\u2019s Brexit position.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see we could get a better deal than Remain and I would campaign for Remain,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut others think that they could get a deal that would be acceptable to the British people and that's democracy - the key issue here is \u2018let the people decide\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe official position remains that a Labour government would seek to strike a new deal with Brussels and then put it to a public vote. Leader Jeremy Corbyn does not want to say how the party would campaign in a referendum until a special conference after the expected general election.\n\nJohn McDonnell has denied that Labour is at war over Brexit, with members at conference today set to decide whether it should become a Remain-backing party.\n\n\u201cI smiled when you used the language earlier of civil war and revolt but there isn\u2019t any war in the Labour Party. It\u2019s about honest, democratic debate,\u201d McDonnell told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\n\u201cPeople have high emotions on this because they feel it\u2019s important. But that's not people respecting each other\u2019s views as well and there will be a bit of banter, of course there will.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell said he was open to being persuaded that a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal was best for the country. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for people to determine their position in advance of knowing the detail of that deal, but my view, actually I think, because I campaigned for Remain, I can\u2019t see at the moment a better deal being achieved. And that\u2019s my view.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying I\u2019m happy to go along with this logical sequence. And I\u2019m happy for others to challenge me and say, \u2018actually, no, this is a better deal\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019d like that debate.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson has declined to deny allegations that he failed to declare potential conflicts of interest as London mayor over the allocation of public money to an American model turned tech entrepreneur.
