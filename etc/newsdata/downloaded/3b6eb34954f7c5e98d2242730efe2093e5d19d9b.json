The agreement arose after poor communication between the organizations allowed a priest later convicted of sexually abusing children to remain working in a school long after initial reports of abuse.\n\nNew revelations, however, suggest that the agency may have overlooked notifications from the archdiocese, the Chicago Tribune first reported Wednesday. Top agency personnel only become aware of the 2006 protocol approximately three weeks ago, Strokosch said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know exactly what happened or at what point in time that procedure fell to the wayside, but the process that was originally in place was no longer followed. There was initially a more robust process,\" Strokosch told USA TODAY. \"Once we became aware of this, we wanted to make sure that there are no current children put in danger.\"\n\nSex abuse claims: Rochester diocese files for bankruptcy protection\n\nStrokosch said the archdiocese had notified DCFS of about 1,100 misconduct allegations since 2006. As the agency began to review those reports, it initially identified 24 cases that required further investigation. Those reports were made by adults who came forward years after the alleged abuse, which occurred when they were children.\n\nBryan Samuels, who was DCFS director at the time of the 2006 agreement, called the recent procedural lapse \u201cboth unsurprising and unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause this wasn\u2019t a legislative requirement or legally binding, because it was done in a specific context\u2014all of those things may have contributed to the agreement falling off the radar as leadership changed,\u201d Samuels said.\n\nThere have been 13 different directors since Samuels left the agency in 2006, Strokosch said.\n\nAs part of the investigations, DCFS has retained Steven Block, a partner at law firm Thompson Hine, to conduct an independent review of how it handles notifications from the archdiocese, according to firm spokesperson Sheila Turner.\n\nOpinion: After Catholic Church sex abuse cover-ups, we in the pews must no longer simply pray & pay\n\nAnne Maselli, director of communications and marketing at the Archdiocese of Chicago, said the church does not know which reports the agency is reviewing, but that it has reported all allegations of child sexual abuse to DCFS and civil authorities.\n\nThe archdiocese has paid about $220 million in misconduct settlements over the past two decades, she said.\n\nFollow Grace Hauck on Twitter @grace_hauck.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Catholic church sex abuse: Illinois investigates Chicago priests", "description": "The\u00a0Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has opened 24 new investigations into alleged sexual misconduct by Catholic priests.", "authors": ["Grace Hauck", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A6bcP9COzOA0.vQzuXFxFQ--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/47a4a2b725c4f53789f8df1fce2c4709", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
