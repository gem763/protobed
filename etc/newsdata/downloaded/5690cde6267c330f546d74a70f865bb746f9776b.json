The trend of zero interest rates is \"perverse\" and can \"poison\" the business environment, said Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, a visiting scholar at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Low interest rates hurt lenders' profits as they narrow the margin that banks can earn. In a negative interest rate environment, lowering rates deeper into negative territory essentially means that lenders are paying more to the central bank to keep their excess funds overnight.\n\nThe addiction to cheap money \u2026 that's the problem, not the solution. Yuwa Hedrick-Wong visiting scholar at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy\n\nSpeaking at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in Singapore on Tuesday, Hedrick-Wong said: \"I'm a firm believer that zero interest rate, or negative interest rates (is) actually doing tremendous damage to the economy over the long term. To begin with, zero interest rates poison the business corporate environment.\" U.S. President Donald Trump has consistently called for low interest rates, tweeting in September that the Fed should cut interest rates to zero or even set negative interest rates. He also appeared to praise Germany for its negative rates on government bonds. European banks have struggled for years in a persistently low interest rate environment \u2014 first hitting zero in 2012 before turning negative in 2014. The European Central Bank pushed its rate further below zero in September, and other countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Japan have also done so. \"We have to reverse that process. Normalization of interest rates has to be the top priority in managing the economy going forward,\" Hedrick-Wong said at a panel discussion. \"The addiction to cheap money \u2026 that's the problem, not the solution.\"", "description": "Central banks around the world are increasingly lowering rates, or moving to negative rates, and analysts warn this could damage the global economy.", "authors": ["Weizhen Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106120172-1568062218958gettyimages-1172101024.jpeg?v=1571210080", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
