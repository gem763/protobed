USA TODAY\n\nCities like Austin, Texas, are working hard to solve homelessness. By partnering with those affected, they've come up with some creative solutions.\n\nFew national problems seem more intractable than homelessness.\n\nOn any given night last year, more than half a million people were experiencing homelessness in America, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Recent counts place New York City\u2019s homeless population at 78,676 and Los Angeles\u2019 at 49,955. Thousands more, equivalent in size to small towns, can be found in city after city: more than 12,000 in and around Seattle; over 8,500 in metropolitan San Diego; and more than 6,000 each in Boston, the Las Vegas area and the county that holds Phoenix.\n\nEven Austin, Texas, which has one of the lowest unemployment rates among America\u2019s largest metropolitan areas (2.8%), is engaged in a heated debate over how to best address homelessness.\n\nWashington can't solve the problem\n\nSome look to Washington to solve the problem. But an issue this persistent and multifaceted is unlikely to be fixed by the federal government alone. Innovative new approaches are more likely to come from local communities, America\u2019s \u201claboratories of democracy.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, most community leaders have looked to \u201cexperts\u201d to solve problems like homelessness. They confer with faculty members at local universities, national policy specialists, members of the local medical community, shelter providers and food kitchen operators.\n\nHomeless encampment in Los Angeles.

We forget to ask what they need to get back on their feet.\n\nIn Austin, they\u2019ve adopted this different approach, engaging those experiencing homelessness in the fight against it, \u201cco-creating\u201d solutions with those living the problem.\n\nThis is a significant departure from business as usual. Who knows better the trials of asking for change, jockeying for space in a Salvation Army shelter or falling through the safety net than someone who has lived this life?\n\nA problem years in the making: 3 things California can do to dig out of its homelessness crisis\n\nThe Austin approach is important for a second reason as well: It gives the effort legitimacy and restores trust in the process, two things in short supply today. It tells people experiencing homelessness (and everyone else in the community) that their ideas matter; that city officials are not just going through the motions for political reasons.\n\nThe brainchild of Austin\u2019s Innovation Office, the Homelessness Advisory Committee was established in 2017. As Kerry O\u2019Connor, Austin\u2019s chief innovation officer, told Bloomberg Cities, \u201cUntil you understand the lived experience of people and can bring that qualitative information in, you\u2019re always going to be flying with a skewed radar that\u2019s sending you in a slightly off direction.\u201d\n\nPublic engagement is worth it\n\nAdvisory committee members meet at a public library branch. The process is sometimes messy, even chaotic. \u201cThe first time we had about 15 people in the room \u2026 a lot of them were looking at us like we were crazy,\u201d Lincoln Neiger, a member of the team working with the Austin Homelessness Advisory Committee, told us. \u201cWhen it comes down to it, \u2026 they want to find a way to give back to their own community that they know is so neglected.\u201d\n\nSeveral \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we think of this sooner?\u201d ideas have grown out of the initiative: providing people experiencing homeless with storage lockers so they can protect their belongings while getting back on their feet; distributing travel-size personal hygiene products to those living on the street so they can carry them when they change locations; and providing them secure online access, using \u201cblockchain\u201d technology, to identity documents they might need for job interviews, for example.\n\n'I couldn't give up': How I got through college as a homeless student\n\nBecause these initiatives are new, it\u2019s way too early to evaluate their success. Even so, it\u2019s small scale, incremental innovations such as these \u2014 coupled with large scale initiatives for mental health support, substance abuse treatment and housing \u2014 that will enable many of those experiencing homelessness to return to normal lives someday.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed now is more such experimentation. Cities need to consider new ways to address these persistent problems and to share decision-making power with those most impacted by the problems.\n\nWhile financial support from Washington can help, research shows that local community entrepreneurs \u2014 citizens and leaders alike \u2014 through teamwork and trial and error, are the source of most solutions to our shared national problems. Homelessness will be no exception.\n\nDan Vogel is director of the Centre for Public Impact in North America, a nonprofit organization founded by Boston Consulting Group.
