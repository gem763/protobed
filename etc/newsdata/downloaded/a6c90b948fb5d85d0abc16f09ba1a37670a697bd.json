That decision allowed Turkey to attack the Syrian Kurdish militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 the United States\u2019 principal ally in battling the Islamic State.\n\nThe Turkish invasion, which began Wednesday, called into question the Kurdish militia\u2019s ability to continue securely holding 11,000 captured ISIS fighters in Syria. They include many who had slipped into the country via the porous border with Turkey when the Islamic State commanded a large swath of Syria and Iraq more than five years ago as part of its now-defunct caliphate.\n\n\u201cI can understand President Trump saying, \u2018We can\u2019t take care of everything,\u2019\u201d Foley said. Nonetheless, she said, \u201cat least the Kurds were making sure the prisoners were secure.\u201d\n\nFoley expressed gratitude that Trump said Wednesday that the United States was taking custody of \u201ca certain number of ISIS fighters that are particularly bad\u201d and placing them elsewhere to ensure they did not escape. \u201cI\u2019m grateful \u2014 that\u2019s great news,\u201d she said.\n\nPreviously Trump had suggested that ISIS detainees in Syria would become the responsibility of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a prospect Foley ridiculed. Erdogan, she said, was \u201cthe one who let a lot of them go in.\u201d\n\nISIS detainees in U.S. custody include two men, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Amon Kotey, who were members of a cell that the group\u2019s foreign hostages had nicknamed the Beatles because of their British-accented English. Syrian Kurdish militia fighters seized them in January 2018 as the ISIS caliphate was collapsing.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, the group beheaded seven American, British and Japanese hostages, among others, uploading videos of the executions on the internet and bragging about them. The first hostage to be beheaded, on Aug. 19, 2014, was James Foley, a journalist and videographer who disappeared in Syria on Thanksgiving Day in 2012.\n\nIt remains unclear precisely where Elsheikh and Kotey are in U.S. custody now. Diane Foley said they should be brought to the United States for trial. But equally important, she said, was that other ISIS fighters who committed crimes are prosecuted, and that in her view the United States must take the lead to ensure this happens.\n\n\u201cIf we do not take this on, we\u2019re going to be very sorry,\u201d she said.\n\nFoley has become a leader among families of slain hostages who have demanded accountability from the United States and other governments to ensure that ISIS prisoners are brought to justice. She is president and founder of the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, a journalist advocacy and educational group.\n\nSpeaking at a panel Monday night at the University of Michigan, one day after Trump announced the U.S. pullback in Syria, Foley was blunt in her criticism.\n\n\u201cThis decision sends a message that those who take our citizens hostage will not face American justice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe implore President Trump to hold these ISIS fighters accountable for their barbaric human rights crimes against our citizens and protect our country against the spread of terror, should they escape.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "The mother of James Foley, the first U.S. hostage beheaded by the Islamic State, expressed concern Thursday that Turkey's assault on Syrian Kurds, who have been guarding thousands of ISIS detainees in Syria, would lead to prisoner escapes, resurrection of the extremist group and dashed hopes for", "authors": ["Rick Gladstone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
