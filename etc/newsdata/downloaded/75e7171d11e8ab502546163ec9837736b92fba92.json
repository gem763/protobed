Harris\u2019 debate performance: \u2018too much odd laughter and canned lines\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Kamala Harris was on the bubble with some California Democratic donors before last night\u2019s debate. Those donors were hoping to see her come out swinging last night and present herself as a serious alternative to Joe Biden. But according to CNBC, last night\u2019s performance failed to impress:\n\nMany of them were hoping for a repeat of the aggressive tactics she used in the first debate, when she took on former Vice President Joe Biden for his willingness to work with segregationists as a senator in the 1970s. Now these sources say that these uncommitted contributors are still not convinced they can dedicate their expansive networks to her cause alone\u2026 One source close to a political fundraising powerhouse in California, Harris\u2019 home state and a region where she\u2019s dominated in the fundraising game, said Friday that they had been having trouble convincing their donors to back her candidacy before the debate. The negative opinion didn\u2019t change after the debate. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything has changed and it\u2019s been grim,\u201d this person said. On the debate stage, this person noted that donors believe Harris is still \u201cunclear about her message and strategy.\u201d They liked the \u201cTrump focus,\u201d this person said, \u201cbut there was too much odd laughter and canned lines.\u201d\n\nOuch! And there\u2019s more including a New York donor who said of Harris\u2019 performance, \u201cShe didn\u2019t score any points.\u201d\n\nBut she definitely seems to be having a good time. Earlier today Ed wrote about one of those awkward moments from the debate in which Harris seemed to be laughing too hard at her own joke. But it wasn\u2019t the only time last night when her laughter seemed to disrupt things, including her own message. At the of a long, serious answer about foreign policy she made a reference to the Wizard of Oz that turned into another laugh-fest between her and 5\u20195\u2033 George Stephanopoulos:\n\nAnd after Andrew Yang proposed giving $1,000 a month to ten supporters, Harris could be heard laughing as Pete Buttigieg prepared to speak:\n\nKamala Harris is definitely having a good time. What she\u2019s not doing is impressing the donors she needs to keep her struggling campaign going.", "description": "\"It's been grim.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kamala-Harris-debate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
