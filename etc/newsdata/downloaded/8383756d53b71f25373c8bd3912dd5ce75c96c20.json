In neighborhoods with names like Little Village, Back of the Yards, and Dolton, squad cars and ambulances scream day and night past shuttered storefronts and boarded-up houses.\n\nWelcome to the one of the most violent cities in America.\n\nThere were 764 homicides here in 2016, according to a recent study by the University of Chicago Crime Lab. That\u2019s a jump of more than 50 percent from the previous year, with most of them occurring in poor \u201cghetto\u201d communities on the South and West Sides.\n\nAll that killing is fueled, at least in part, by the city\u2019s booming drug trade.\n\nNative poet Carl Sandburg once dubbed his home town \u201cPlayer with Railroads and the Nation\u2019s Freight Handler.\u201d Add one of the country\u2019s busiest airports and a cluster of major highway arteries to all those railroads and you get what DEA agent Mark Giuffre, of the Chicago Field Division, calls a \u201clogistical hub\u201d for narcotics trafficking.\n\n\u201c The cartels supply the narcotics to the violent Chicago street gangs,\u201d Giuffre tells The Daily Beast. \u201c Illicit drug smuggling [and] transportation groups are selling their services to any cartel willing to pay for them.\u201d\n\nShipments of heroin, cocaine, and crystal meth pass through the Second City on their way to neighboring states like Wisconsin and Indiana.\n\nOne popular drug-running route is I-290, which connects to Milwaukee and points west, and is known locally as the Heroin Highway.\n\n\u201c Much of what comes here doesn\u2019t stay here,\u201d says Giuffre, whose full title is Assistant Special Agent in Charge. He refers to the Toddlin\u2019 Town as a \u201clucrative market\u201d and \u201ctransshipment point\u201d for illicit substances to reach whole swaths of the Midwest and Eastern U.S.\n\nWholesale vs Retail Slaughter\n\nMost of the drug routes originate on the Southwest border with Mexico, in places like Tijuana and El Paso. The most common method for shipping dope north is overland by road, often in tractor-trailers, busses, or personal cars equipped with hidden compartments.\n\nMexican Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) operating cells in the U.S. typically refrain from acts of overt mayhem, so as not to call attention to their presence. Giuffre describes these cells as disciplined networks made up of the friends and family members of cartel operatives back home.\n\n\u201c They don\u2019t distribute a single kilo without specific instructions,\u201d he says.\n\nThe once-dominant Sinaloa Cartel has been weakened in Chicago, due to the capture and extradition of former boss Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. That power shift has allowed other groups like The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), Los Rojos, and Guerreros Unidos to move into the Chi-town marketplace.\n\nIn Mexico, the competition to replace the Sinaloa Cartel has led to a feeding frenzy among rival DTOs, sending the country\u2019s murder rate soaring to the highest level since the country\u2019s Drug War began in 2006.\n\nLast year also marked a two-decade high for homicides in Chicago, but Giuffre says it\u2019s \u201cnot cartel warfare\u201d in the Windy City.\n\nInstead it\u2019s the rival street gangs in Chicago supplied by the DTOs that are engaged in deadly turf battles.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s all about territorial beefs between gangs,\u201d says Adam Isacson, a security expert with the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), in a phone interview with The Daily Beast.\n\nSome of the factional gang killings occur during \u201cfighting for territory for local drug sales\u201d on corners and city blocks, while others are rooted in \u201csimple hatred,\u201d he says.\n\nThe cartels might be slaughtering each other over shipping corridors in Mexico, but on the U.S. side of the border, the \u201cguys doing wholesale are less violent than the guys doing retail,\u201d Isacson says.\n\nSturm and Gang\n\nThe DEA estimates there to be about 100,000 active members of crime groups in Chicago, which it lists as \u201cthe street gang capital of America.\u201d Some of the most powerful groups are the Gangster Disciples, the Vice Lords, and the Latin Kings. But within these umbrella organizations there can be schisms and rivalries. In all there are some 700 factions, and many of them use coded handshakes, colors, or patterns of dress to i.d. each other\u2014or spot outsiders in their neighborhoods.\n\nHandguns are the most common weapon for gangsters, because they\u2019re cheap and easy to hide under loose clothing. But they\u2019ve also been known to set up ambushes using assault rifles capable of piercing police body armor. Assaults on funerals and memorial services for fallen members of rival outfits are a favorite trick, as the perceived enemies are then gathered in large numbers, often unarmed and in the open.\n\nMany of the gangs operate out of so-called \u201ctrap houses,\u201d which are foreclosed or abandoned homes where they hold meetings and repackage or distribute narcotics. Other trap houses are occupied for more innocent purposes, such as shelter or sleeping (poverty and homelessness are common among gang members).\n\nGuadalupe Cruz, a social worker and teacher at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says that for many young people, gang involvement is \u201cgenerational\u201d due to young people having \u201cparents [who] were also involved in the street life.\u201d\n\nThe culture is so ingrained that it becomes a \u201csocial norm to wear certain colors, or not to cross certain streets,\u201d Cruz explains, in an interview with The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201c They\u2019re exposed to violence so this is what they know,\u201d says Cruz, who runs an after-school mentorship program in Little Village, about a mile from the Heroin Highway.\n\n\u201c When someone is shot and on the floor dying, they don\u2019t react,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reaction that something is wrong, or that it shouldn\u2019t be like this.\u201d\n\nFighting Back\n\nOne person who does know it shouldn\u2019t be like this is Chicago-based martial artist Darrel Taylor. On a stifling hot night in late July, Coach Taylor takes a few minutes away from training aspiring fighters at a gym on the South Side to speak with The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201c As a black man in America you don\u2019t have too many positive role models,\u201d says Taylor, 32. \u201cI try to be the best coach I can. If they come to me with any life problems, I help them out to the best of my abilities.\u201d\n\nTaylor instructs his charges in multiple forms, and tonight\u2019s focus is boxing. The Sweet Science and other martial arts teach discipline and a solid work ethic, as well as \u201cproblem solving on the go,\u201d he says.\n\nThe gym where Taylor trains tonight sits across from what was once a K-Mart and is now just another empty shell. Inside the club a half-dozen fighters wait in line to \u201cwork the pads\u201d with their coach. Most of them will use gloves and other gear he\u2019s brought for them.\n\n\u201c Combat sports helps them to develop mental toughness, so they\u2019re ready when life throws them a curveball. If you can do this you can survive the life.\u201d Taylor encourages his pupils to \u201cstay in school with a purpose,\u201d although he acknowledges that many of them see professional fighting as a way to escape poverty, \u201cof making it out.\u201d\n\nTaylor also credits his martial arts background for having kept him on the straight and narrow.\n\n\u201c Most of my friends growing up were involved in that [gangster] life,\u201d he says, raising his voice over the steady thumping of fighters on the heavy bags. \u201cI always told them, \u2018I can\u2019t do that\u2014I\u2019ve got practice.\u2019\u201d\n\nAddiction Affliction\n\nDespite the efforts of volunteers like Cruz and Taylor, Chicago was last year\u2019s U.S. leader for homicides committed. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not its only dubious distinction.\n\n\u201c Chicago is number one in the nation for heroin overdose related emergency room visits, and number one in the nation for people seeking publically funded treatment for heroin dependency, \u201d according to DEA Agent Giuffre.\n\nHe attributes that in part to an increase in street-level purity by about 30 percent in recent years, as well as the cartels\u2019 penchant for cutting their smack with the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which can cause even seasoned junkies to O.D.\n\nGiuffre, who has more than thirty years of narcotics law enforcement experience, accuses the cartels of \u201cprofiting off the misery of addiction.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to heroin, their profits are going up. The Chicago DEA Field Office\u2019s seizures over the last three years have climbed by 300 percent\u2014yet street prices of the drug have continued to fall.\n\nA single-serving size bag of heroin\u2014often called a \u201cblow\u201d\u2014in Chicago sells for about $10.\n\nA \u201cjab\u201d is 10 blows and usually goes for about $100 (normally a person ordering a gram-sized jab will get two or three extra blows in their bag.)\n\nA kilogram of arm candy, meanwhile, runs for anywhere between $48,000to $55,000, as the price can shift down for bulk purchases.\n\n\u201c It looks like from the DEA numbers that Mexican heroin production has tripled since 2013, which would explain why supplies in Chicago have increased similarly,\u201d says WOLA\u2019s Isacson.\n\nThe surge in poppy cultivation in Mexican states like Guerrero has been caused in part by the cartels\u2019 shift away from marijuana, after legalization and decriminalization in the U.S. caused the price of weed to plummet. A steep rise in American demand for heroin has also contributed, as government crackdowns on prescribed opioids forces users to swap pills for the needle.\n\nAnd the newly empowered Jalisco New Generation Cartel also \u201cspecializes in [heroin] and they\u2019ve been eating Sinaloa\u2019s lunch,\u201d says Isacson, referring to the downfall of Chapo Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s old syndicate.\n\n\u201c Seizures have been increasing at the border, but they haven\u2019t tripled. So a lot more is getting through too.\u201d Tunnels, cleverly disguised consumer goods, and even food packages are all tricks in the cartels arsenal for eluding customs inspectors.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s just so easy to conceal,\u201d Isacson says.\n\nCity on Fire\n\nSpecial Agent Giuffre\u2019s team remains focused on \u201ccommand and control of the cartels\u201d using \u201ca variety of efforts focused on cartel cell leaders.\u201d His office is responsible for scores of successful indictments, including those against the infamous El Chapo and more than 70 of his co-conspirators.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department\u2019s track record, on the other hand, isn\u2019t so sterling.\n\nIsacson, of WOLA, says \u201cChicago policing efforts\u201d are also to blame for the deteriorating security situation.\n\n\u201c The relationship with the community is bad,\u201d he says, and begins to tick off a list of complaints that include slow response times, charges of police killings and torture of suspects, even allegations that a \u201cpolice death squad\u201d was at work in the city. (The Chicago police department did not respond to interview requests for this story.)\n\nThose factors also combine with \u201cpoor outreach to the south and west sides of Chicago which are both black and Latino,\u201d Isacson says. \u201cIt\u2019s a city with a lot of gangs, but a lot of cities have a lot of gangs. Other cities have meetings with communities . . . I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re so resistant to change.\u201d\n\nUIC teacher Guadalupe Cruz, who also works for the NGO Cure Violence in Honduras and Mexico, says the habit of neglecting certain communities goes beyond just local law enforcement. And that this collective indifference to marginalized neighborhoods is directly tied to the recent spike in homicides.\n\nMany young men turn to hustling drugs on the street for the simple reason that \u201cthere are no jobs, but they still have to feed their kids,\u201d Cruz says.\n\n\u201c Of course violence is going to go up when they don\u2019t have anything else to do.\u201d", "description": "As Mexico\u2019s cartels manage to get more and more heroin into the U.S. each year, Chicago\u2019s gangs are scrambling to be the ones to distribute it.", "authors": ["Jeremy Kryt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1501294406/170718-kryt-chicago-drugs-tease-5_yrr6p9", "published_at": "2017-07-29"}
