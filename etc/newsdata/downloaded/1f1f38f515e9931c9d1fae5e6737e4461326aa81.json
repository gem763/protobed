The sources also told Bloomberg that tariffs due to go into place next week could be suspended.\n\nIt's hoped that this would then allow further talks to take place on deeper issues such as intellectual property and tech, as this was one of the major stumbling blocks in past talks.\n\nChina earlier this year sent markets into meltdown after the country allowed the yuan to slip below its 7 per dollar threshold - making the currency weaker, and therefore making Chinese exports more attractive to foreign buyers.\n\nOff-shore Chinese yuan was up 0.2% on the news at 4 am EST.\n\nCurrently, it's not expected that a long-term deal will come from the two days of talks this week, however, this could come later in the year if talks go well this week.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "All eyes are on the trade war as talks begin on Thursday and Friday, but could go on longer, depending on how they go.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9460/20a21a7310c3455bbe90e41d93cd63a3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
