Pornography? Vodka shots? None of the above. These and other illustrious writers were talking about adverbs and adjectives.\n\nHorror-meister Stephen King has warned \u2014 cryptically? \u2014 \"the adverb is not your friend. I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs.\"\n\nWriters Elmore Leonard, Graham Greene and Stephen King have all railed against the overuse of adverbs. (Vince Bucci/National Portrait Gallery/Shane Leonard)\n\nIf that artillery weren't heavy enough, the critics have been joined by no less than Pope Francis, Vicar of Christ, Bishop of Rome, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy.\n\nHis thoughts were not entombed in an encyclical, and there was no Bull.\n\nHis Holiness was giving a speech to the Vatican communications team. We pause here for a moment to reflect.\n\nThe very fact of a Vatican communications team gives one a slightly dislocated feeling.\n\nI don't expect some aging monk with a quill pen fighting off nosy journalists, but a complete full-blooded team sounds like the West Wing of the White House without the craziness.\n\nThe Pope did not mince his words, first going after the use of adjectives.\n\n\"I am allergic to those words,\" he intoned. He apparently breaks out in hives when he hears the word, \"authentic,\" as in \"authentic Christians.\"\n\n\"We have fallen into the culture of adjectives and adverbs and we have forgotten the strength of nouns. Why say authentically Christian? The mere fact of the noun Christian is strong; it is an adjective noun, yes, but it is a noun.\"\n\nI would give my recording of Irish Tenor John McCormack singing \"Ave Maria\" to have seen the Vatican scribes reacting to the Pope's jeremiad.\n\nA nun waits for the arrival of Pope Francis for his weekly general audience, in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. (Andrew Medichini/Associated Press)\n\nThey must have muttered to each other something like \"sta scherzando\" \u2014 \"is he kidding?\".\n\nNo, the Holy Father was not kidding. He went on.\n\n\"For the church communication is a mission. One of the things you must not do is advertising. You must not behave like human business that tries to attract more people. To use a technical word: you must not proselytize; it is not Christian to proselytize.\"\n\nAt which point one of the flacks must have said to a colleague: \"Dove sta andando con le cose?\" (\"Where is he going with this stuff?\")\n\nI guess when your head is overstuffed with tendentious issues such as same-sex marriage and wayward bishops, it eases things a bit to be able to expostulate for a time on things like syntax and grammar.\n\nI remember the nuns of my youth \u2014 tough and tough-minded women, but fair \u2014 pounding the rules of grammar into us with an unswerving resolve.\n\nBut I don't remember them ever effacing adjectives and adverbs from our vocabulary.\n\nIt creates a difficult theology for the faithful who believe the Pope is infallible in matters of faith and morals.\n\nDoes that infallibility extend to adjectives and adverbs? What about conditional sentences and subjunctive clauses?\n\nHoc est difficilimum, as we used to say in our living Latin class.\n\nIt would be embarrassing to be excommunicated for lousy grammar. Pardon the adjective.\n\nClick 'listen' above to hear Michael's essay.", "description": "To crime novelist Elmore Leonard, their use is \u2018a mortal sin.\u2019 Graham Greene said they were \u2018beastly.\u2019 They have been called \u2018the lazy tool of a weak mind.\u2019 Drugs?
