With Charlie and Ella trapped in the tunnels below, Nancy and Darren Osbourne (Jessica Fox and Ashely Taylor Dawson) headed off to locate the children \u2014 but they found themselves trapped as a result. Tonight, the pair search for a way out, but will old feelings resurface in the process?\n\nAs chaos reigned in the village, Walter (Trevor A Toussaint) made it his mission to inform Nancy and Darren that he saw Charlie and Ella heading down to the tunnels below prior to the incident with the crane. Horrified, the pair headed off in search of the kids.\n\nHowever \u2014 unbeknown to Nancy and Darren \u2014 Charlie and Ella had already managed to find a way out of the tunnels, and thus they continued searching \u2014 and matters were made worse when the roof above them began to cave in.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nTonight, Leela (Kirsty-Leigh Porter) enquires if there\u2019s anyone else down in tunnels, and Charlie claims that there isn\u2019t \u2014 as he hasn\u2019t a clue about Nancy and Darren having gone down there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Nancy and Darren come to the realisation that no-one knows where they are\u2014 which means that nobody will come looking for them.\n\nWhile waiting for the dust to settle, the pair have a chat \u2014 but that chat soon gets a bit heated, and thus they bicker about their past.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nThey begin to wonder if they\u2019re going to survive, and \u2014 with emotions running high \u2014 it seems as if old feelings will come the forefront.\n\nWill Nancy and Darren fully cheat on their respective partners?\n\nTensions have been high between Darren and Mandy (Sarah Jayne Dunn) as a result of Darren learning that he\u2019s not DJ\u2019s dad.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Kyle (Adam Rickitt) wasn\u2019t too pleased at Nancy for getting involved in her ex\u2019s business earlier in the week, so it\u2019s fair to say that both couples have gone through a bit of a rough patch as of late.\n\nNancy and Darren have a long history together, and \u2014 with their lives on the line \u2014 perhaps they will give into temptation?\n\nHollyoaks continues Wednesday 30th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "With Darren and Nancy trapped in the tunnels \u2014 and no-one coming to their rescue \u2014 old feelings seemingly come to the forefront.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5289-NANCY-AND-DARREN-03-26ac_1572452104.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
