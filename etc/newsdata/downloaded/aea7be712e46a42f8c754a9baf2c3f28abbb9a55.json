Analysts are tripping over themselves to up their price targets on some giant S&P 500 stocks as earnings season goes on.\n\nX\n\nOver the past four weeks, analysts boosted their 12-month price targets by 4% or more on seven stocks in the S&P Total Market Index valued at $55 billion or more. Many of these stocks, such as Tesla (TSLA), Nike (NKE) and logistics firm Prologis (PLD), just topped third-quarter earnings forecasts, giving analysts cause to expect more. The results are based on an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from MarketSmith and S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nApple (AAPL) stock is another example where analyst price targets can't move higher fast enough.\n\nBest of all, some of these are leading S&P 500 stocks that still have upside potential before hitting the higher targets.\n\nTesla: Analysts Racing To Keep Up\n\nGiven that the electric car maker is about to report one of the largest losses this year in Corporate America, guessing its value is tricky. Analysts are racing to raise their low expectations.\n\nGuesses have been overly pessimistic. Over the past month, analysts boosted their 12-month price target on Tesla by more than 7% to 284.30. It's the only company of this size outside the S&P 500 where the target rose this much.\n\nAnd analysts still don't expect much. That price target is still 13% below Tesla's Friday closing price of 328.13. Shares are down 1.4% this year. Analysts remain skeptical even though the company on Oct. 23 reported a quarterly adjusted profit of $1.86 a share, well above the 23-cents-a-share loss predicted. The company is expected to lose more than $860 million this year, including all expenses.\n\nTesla remains an aspiration stock. The Composite Rating of Tesla is a low 58, which is by far the lowest of any on this list. It's a top holding of millennials.\n\nWhen it comes to analysts' perception of Tesla, \"the market was either underestimating the health of the consumer or overstating the weakness of the economy,\" Bespoke Investment Group said in a report.\n\nNike: S&P 500 Company Laps Estimates\n\nNike joins Tesla as the second member of the consumer discretionary sector where analysts are boosting price targets the most. Over the past month, analysts upped their target on the sneaker maker by 7.8% on average to 102.50.\n\nIf analysts' new target is on track, that means there's still nearly 13% upside for the stock. That's an impressive amount of headroom if you consider the stock is already up 22.6% this year to 90.92 a share.\n\nMuch of the momentum and 84 Composite Rating can be explained by the company's solid earnings beat on Sept. 2. Nike reported a quarterly adjusted profit of 86 cents a share on Sept. 24, topping estimates by more than 20%.\n\nNo wonder analysts are upping price targets. Profit is seen vaulting 16% this calendar year to $2.74 a share.\n\nPrologis: S&P 500 Rising Price Targets And Yield, Too\n\nInvestors looking for yield, in addition to rising prices, are looking at the real estate sector. Prologis, a San Francisco-based shipping and warehousing firm, yields a market-beating 2.3%. But on top of that yield, the stock is up 55% this year to 90.86.\n\nNo wonder analysts can' t keep up with this 99 Composite Rating stock. Analysts boosted price targets on average 7% over the past month to 91.90. And that's barely ahead of where the stock closed Friday.\n\nThe S&P 500 company's 42% better-than-expected third quarter profit only stoked enthusiasm.\n\nWe'll see if these stocks can keep staying a step, or two, ahead of rising price targets.\n\nS&P Total Market Index Stocks With Biggest Hikes In Price Targets\n\nCompany Ticker Target Price % change last month target price Stock price 10/25/2019 Upside to target Composite Rating Sector Nike (NKE) 102.50 7.82% 90.92 12.7% 84 Consumer Discretionary Tesla (TSLA) 284.30 7.06% 328.13 -13.4% 58 Consumer Discretionary Prologis (PLD) 91.90 7.05% 90.86 1.1% 99 Real Estate NextEra Energy (NEE) 235.60 5.67% 236.88 -0.5% 99 Utilities Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) 60.90 4.86% 54.98 10.8% 96 Health Care Apple (AAPL) 231.70 4.38% 246.58 -6.0% 89 Information Technology Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) 593.40 4.26% 549.27 8.0% 99 Health Care\n\nSource: IBD, S&P Global Market Intelligence, based on average price target changes the past month\n\nFollow Matt Krantz on Twitter @mattkrantz\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAmazon Stock Drop Costs Top Investors (Including You) $2.9 Billion\n\nStock Market Crash Near?
