Shokin, who was accused of corruption, was voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament soon after.\n\nBiden\u2019s son, Hunter, stood to benefit from the decision because he was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian businessman that was being targeted by the prosecutor.", "description": "House Democrats announced they are launching a \u201cbroad investigation\u201d into President Trump\u2019s efforts to determine if Ukraine officials attempted to damage his 2016 campaign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c16bba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F5c%2Ffa%2F2a1f87d643e290f747a284786e8e%2Frudy-giuliani-donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
