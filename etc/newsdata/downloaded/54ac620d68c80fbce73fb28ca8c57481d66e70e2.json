Despite the many perks of early retirement \u2014 waking up whenever you want, for example \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the easiest decision.\n\nDogen said he suffered an identity crisis after giving up his title as executive director at an investment firm. He also doubted himself for the first few years of early retirement. He stopped telling people that he had retired early because he worried they just wouldn\u2019t understand. He was disappointed he didn\u2019t feel happier with his supposedly carefree life. \u201cI\u2019m an extrovert who enjoys constant human interaction,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cLosing the constant camaraderie of colleagues, competitors and clients was the most difficult to deal with. So much of my social network revolved around my job because I consistently worked 12 hour days.\u201d\n\nDogen didn\u2019t give in to the doubt though, and feels that his perseverance has paid off. Not a day goes by that he and his wife are not thankful for retiring early, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always another dollar to be made, but never another second to create,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you have enough money to live comfortably, having more money won\u2019t bring about any more happiness.\u201d Still, he acknowledges this lifestyle isn\u2019t for everyone.\n\nEven knowing how good early retirement can feel in the end, others feel the jitters while taking the leap. Jay, who is becoming a stay-at-home dad later this year after deciding to retire early at the age of 41, is one of them. He has been saving and has a wife who will keep her full-time job as a professor \u2014 but he\u2019s still a little unsure about the big lifestyle change.\n\nJay \u2014 who didn\u2019t want his full name to appear in this article because he doesn\u2019t want his current employer to know he\u2019s planning to leave \u2014 is fearful of retiring early for a few reasons. He\u2019s worried about the loss of income, even if his family will be supported by passive income and his wife\u2019s salary. He\u2019s also suffering from the fear of the unknown and a potential loss of identity, he said. What if there\u2019s a devastating market downturn, or he gets a medical diagnosis for an expensive-to-treat disease? \u201cThese things could all happen if I\u2019m still working but I have a steady paycheck coming in and don\u2019t care if my brokerage accounts lose 60% of their value,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso see: 13 simple ways to make early retirement easier\n\nThe FIRE movement, short for \u201cfinancial independence, retire early,\u201d is burning up on the internet. Hundreds, if not thousands, of anonymous bloggers (they tend not to reveal their identities because they\u2019re still employed and are afraid of losing their jobs) share their goals of leaving their 9-to-5 jobs and write about how they plan to do so. Some choose to give up their careers entirely, while others decide to freelance in the industry they work in or try an entirely new part-time job.\n\nGiven the number of readers some of these bloggers have \u2014 Dogen\u2019s site says he has about a million page views a month \u2014 it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a lot of interest in this concept. Reddit has an entire section devoted to financial independence, where users discuss in various threads how to accomplish early retirement, trade tips for specific industries and share personal experiences and methods.\n\nNot all members of the FIRE community agree on how much you actually need to retire or how to go about saving that much, but they tend to agree the concept is very much worth the extra work and sacrifice.\n\nIs it though? MarketWatch spoke with financial advisers about the financial and emotional consequences of early retirement.\n\nNo more active income\n\nEarly retirees give up potentially high earnings, especially considering wages rise well into middle-age for many Americans. Earnings tend to peak around 48 for men and about 39 for women, according to an analysis by PayScale.\n\nPhysical laborers see peak earnings at an earlier age, whereas executives may not peak until their 50s or 60s. \u201cIndividuals who retire early are choosing to stop their earned income, which is the greatest defense against life expenses,\u201d said Hank Mulvihill, director and senior wealth adviser at Smith Anglin in Dallas. \u201cThis is a decision not to be taken lightly.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s one way to figure out if early retirement is a sound financial decision: if savings and investments can produce equivalent after-tax earnings to your current income and there\u2019s a chance those earnings will grow similarly to a salary or bonus, then it may work, Mulvihill said. But early retirees also have to consider other components of compensation, including insurance coverage and employer matches in retirement accounts, he said.\n\nSaying goodbye to active income also means potentially reducing Social Security benefits. \u201cIf you believe that Social Security will be a part of your retirement income, then reducing your working years can have a significant impact on your financial benefit,\u201d said Nicole Theisen Strbich, director of financial planning at Buckingham Financial Group in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nUnderstand how much work is involved\n\nSome say the idea of sustainable passive income \u2014 enough to last through retirement and thereafter \u2014 is a pipe dream. That\u2019s what Gary Vaynerchuk, entrepreneur and author of \u201cCrush It: Why Now Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion,\u201d argued in a popular Youtube video. \u201cPassive income doesn\u2019t exist and anything that starts with \u2019I don\u2019t want to work\u2019 is already a problem,\u201d Vaynerchuk said in the video. The best way to make money is to make less money, just enough to live, and focus on something you\u2019re passionate about. \u201dSave all those dollars, build something for yourself over seven years and then transition from your **** job to your own business. That\u2019s passive.\u201d\n\nJosh Brown, financial adviser and chief executive officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management in New York, agreed with Vaynerchuk\u2019s sentiments, and shared his own thoughts about the video on his blog. \u201cYou need to accumulate assets in order to generate large amounts of passive income,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cYou need to work like a dog over many years and not spend in order to accumulate those assets. There\u2019s no in between unless you win the lottery.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: There\u2019s good early retirement and bad early retirement. What to do if you get the bad one\n\nUntether yourself from consumer culture\n\nTo save enough, early retirement hopefuls will have to work extra hard and change their lifestyles, which may involve cutting back on eating out, movies and vacations. \u201cThey often have to live on a shoestring budget and forgo things that make life enjoyable,\u201d said Anthony Badillo, lead planner at virtual financial advisory firm Gen Y Planning.\n\nAggressively saving is never a bad thing, he noted, and even people who don\u2019t want to retire early should try to save 20% of their gross income if possible. But there must be balance. \u201cI believe that we should use our money to live our best lives according to our specific values and beliefs,\u201d Badillo told MarketWatch.\n\nVicki Robin, a personal finance guru and author of \u201cYour Money or Your Life,\u201d said the key to achieving financial independence is to clear the mind of the \u201cthrall of the consumer culture.\u201d\n\nIn other words, early retirees will most likely be successful if they can spend less on non-essentials. In the new version of her book, originally published in the early 1990s, she argues that financial independence must also include a bit of self-reliance, as in cooking more meals at home and doing repairs around the house yourself whenever possible.\n\nThe rise of the FIRE movement also comes at a time when people are prioritizing experiences over material possessions. There are plenty of less expensive excursions, like a day at the beach, sitting in cheap bleacher seats at a baseball game, going hiking or enjoying a potluck at someone\u2019s home.\n\nAlso see: You can retire early without adopting Mr. Money Mustache\u2019s extreme frugality\n\nLimited access to retirement accounts\n\nSocial Security, Medicare and other federal benefits have age restrictions. Many individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans aren\u2019t available without penalty under age 59 \u00bd, said John Middleton, a financial adviser at Brighton Financial Planning in Clinton, N.J.\n\n\u201cThe early withdrawal penalties are severe enough to make it unlikely these income sources will sustain early retirement through age 62, at which point individuals could claim Social Security income,\u201d he said. To make early retirement work, individuals would need to aggressively save and create a financial plan that factors in which accounts they can use and when.\n\nFear of the unknown\n\nJay said he was afraid of a market downturn or unexpected medical expenses, among other unpredictable events. It\u2019s one of the main financial reasons people shouldn\u2019t retire in their 30s and 40s, said Roger Ma, a financial planner at lifelaidout in New York City. \u201cLife happens,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of unexpected things can happen to you that may totally derail your early retirement plan.\u201d\n\nPeople tend to dangerously underestimate their health care costs. More people have had trouble paying for their health insurance since 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy organization based in San Francisco.\n\nAs a result, many people delay health care because it is too expensive. Some skip medical exams and treatment while others aren\u2019t filling prescriptions, the foundation said. For a 65-year-old American couple retiring in 2018, the estimated cost of healthcare is $280,000 through retirement and that figure is expected to rise indefinitely. That estimate does not include long-term care.\n\nWhat to ask yourself before taking the leap of faith\n\nStill interested in retiring early? Ask yourself the following questions, said George Gagliardi, a financial adviser at Coromandel Wealth Management in Lexington, Mass.\n\n\u2022 Where will you get health insurance before age 65 when Medicare starts? Have you factored in the cost of health care in your expense estimates?\n\n\u2022 Do you have financial reserves so that you don\u2019t have to take Social Security as soon as it becomes available to you? (The longer you wait, the more you\u2019ll see in Social Security income).\n\n\u2022 How long do you think you\u2019ll live? The answer will determine how much more you need to save to stretch through the next five or maybe six decades.\n\n\u2022 How much guaranteed income do you have, such as pensions and annuities?\n\n\u2022 Have you made a financial plan for your estimated living costs in retirement?\n\n\u2022 How might the stock market affect your assets if there were to be a downturn much later in life?\n\n\u201cRetiring early is something that could allow for many more years of good times at an age when adults are still active,\u201d Gagliardi said. \u201cHowever, doing it on a wing and a prayer is a recipe for a possible disaster later in life. Like most things, planning is crucial for success here.\u201d", "description": "The FIRE concept is lit, but it\u2019s not always worth it.", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GP249_flame_ZG_20180830093329.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-30"}
