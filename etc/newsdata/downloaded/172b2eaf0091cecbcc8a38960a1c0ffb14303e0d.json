But 29 percent of those reward cardholders have allowed their earnings to expire, according to Bankrate's latest survey.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly half (46 percent) of U.S. adults who participate in airline and hotel rewards programs have let their points or miles expire at some point, according to the analysis.\n\nThis is real money \u2026 The average American has a frequent flyer balance worth about $350. The average hotel point stash is worth over $200. And in terms of credit card rewards it is about $150. - Bankrate.com credit card analyst Ted Rossman\n\n\u201cThis is real money \u2026 Even if you take a conservative valuation and you say one cent per point or mile, we found that the average American has a frequent flyer balance worth about $350. The average hotel point stash is worth over $200. And in terms of credit card rewards it is about $150,\u201d Bankrate.com credit card analyst Ted Rossman told FOX Business.\n\n\"Horrifying\"\n\nAccording to the survey, more than half of U.S. adults (53 percent) admit they have no idea how much 10,000 rewards points/miles are worth. The correct answer is generally in the $100 to $199 range \u2013 roughly 1 to 2 cents apiece \u2013 but just 18 percent of Americans know that.\n\nTravel blogger Janice Lintz, who has taken out more than 46 credit cards in five years and earned 2.6 million miles in sign-up bonuses, told FOX Business that she finds the stats to be perplexing.\n\n\u201cThat is horrifying, why would anyone intentionally do that?\u201d says Lintz, who wants to visit every country in the world and is confident that travel rewards can help her reach her goal. (Her current tally is at 135.)\n\nLintz, who says she puts stickers on different cards as reminders and also relies on the rewards-program tracking app Award Wallet, says that keeping on top of it all can be \u201ctedious,\u201d but is always worth it.\n\n\u201c[Thanks to points], I rarely pay for airline tickets,\u201d Lintz says.\n\nRossman says Award Wallet is one of the more popular rewards tracking apps, but added that it is \u201cnot perfect ... [and the] free version doesn\u2019t get you as much as it used to.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cSuper complicated\u201d\n\nWhy would anyone leave free money on the table?\n\n\u201cI think there are two main reasons. I think some of it is people are not aware. And I think the other part is that people just think these programs are super complicated,\u201d Rossman says.\n\nBut, he adds, they don\u2019t have to be.\n\n\u201cNot everybody has to be a travel hacker dropping everything to fly to the Maldives at the next available opportunity. There\u2019s ways to get everyday value out of these programs. It could be [as simple as] a cashback credit card,\u201d Rossman advises.\n\n\u201cIf you participate in a program like Chase Ultimate Rewards, or Amex Membership Rewards or Citi ThankYou Points, these are going to offer you a dozen or more airlines or hotel chains that you can transfer your points to. You can also use them for cash back, statement credit, gift cards and merchandise.\u201d\n\nHe also says to cash in as often as possible.\n\n\u201cMy advice is to redeem these things frequently. You really shouldn\u2019t build up a huge balance because there is really no benefit to being a points millionaire. These things are not going to get more valuable over time,\u201d he says.", "description": "Many Americans are leaving money on the table when it comes to travel and credit card rewards programs, according to a new survey.", "authors": ["Megan Dowd"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Expending-money-TOP-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
