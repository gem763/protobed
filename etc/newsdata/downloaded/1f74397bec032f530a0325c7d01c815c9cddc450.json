Now, his edge has been slashed to 9 percentage points from 18.\n\nThe latest poll also moves Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who garnered 4 percent support, closer to qualifying for two debates. She needs to reach a 3 percent threshold in one more poll approved by the Democratic National Committee before Nov. 13 to participate in the upcoming forum in Atlanta on Nov. 20. If the congresswoman ultimately qualifies, she will become the 10th candidate set to appear on stage next month.\n\nGabbard has halfway met the polling requirements for the Dec. 19 debate, hosted by POLITICO and PBS in Los Angeles, and needs to hit 4 percent in two additional DNC-approved polls by Dec. 12. She must also clear a donor threshold of 200,000 contributors for December, however. Her campaign did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether she had crossed the new donations mark; as of mid-September she had 172,000 donors.\n\nSo far, only four candidates \u2014 Biden, Buttigeig, Sanders and Warren \u2014 have qualified for the December debate. Harris is likely to join them, despite polling at only 3 percent in the Suffolk survey, needing just one more poll to qualify.\n\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll was conducted Oct. 23-26, surveying 399 likely Democratic voters. The margin of sampling error for that group is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/32/f9/07503ff14aaf9a76dd23b383851e/191030-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
