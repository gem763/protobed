To end this matter once and for all, we will follow the court\u2019s instruction and move forward with adoption of a nonpartisan map.\u201d\n\nCommon Cause, the nonprofit government watchdog group that filed the lawsuit, called Tuesday\u2019s ruling \u201ca historic victory for the people of North Carolina.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court has made clear that partisan gerrymandering violates our state\u2019s constitution and is unacceptable,\u201d Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, said in a statement. \u201cThanks to the court\u2019s landmark decision, politicians in Raleigh will no longer be able to rig our elections through partisan gerrymandering.\u201d\n\nState Democrats hailed the news as well.\n\n\u201cFolks I\u2019ve been in the NC legislature for about five years and this is the single best news I have ever heard,\u201d North Carolina state Sen. Jeff Jackson (D) said in a tweet soon after the judges announced their ruling.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers of North Carolina\u2019s bicameral General Assembly. The state Senate has 50 seats, with 29 held by Republicans and 21 held by Democrats. In the state House, Republicans control 64 seats, while Democrats hold 55 seats, and one remains vacant.\n\nThe Supreme Court, considering partisan gerrymanders of congressional districts in North Carolina and Maryland this summer, ruled 5 to 4 that policing such gerrymanders is not the province of federal courts.\n\n\u201cWe have no commission to allocate political power and influence in the absence of a constitutional directive or legal standards to guide us in the exercise of such authority,\u201d wrote Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in a decision that split along ideological lines.\n\nBut he noted that those opposed to partisan gerrymandering had other options, such as trying to create independent commissions to draw electoral lines, or to challenge maps in state courts under provisions in state constitutions.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion does not condone excessive partisan gerrymandering. Nor does our conclusion condemn complaints about districting to echo into a void,\u201d Roberts wrote, adding that \u201cprovisions in state statutes and state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for state courts to apply.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court ordered redrawing some districts in that state because of a \u201cfair districts\u201d amendment to that state\u2019s Constitution, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered a new congressional map because it said partisan concerns resulted in districts there that overwhelmingly favored Republican candidates in a state that usually is a toss-up.\n\nThe North Carolina court found its power to order new districts in a provision \u201coriginally enacted in 1776 and contained in the \u2018Declaration of Rights\u2019 of our Constitution, [which] simply states that \u2018[a]ll elections shall be free.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe court concluded that \u201cthe Free Elections Clause of the North Carolina Constitution guarantees that all elections must be conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and truthfully, the will of the People and that this is a fundamental right of North Carolina citizens, a compelling governmental interest, and a cornerstone of our democratic form of government.\u201d\n\nRichard Hasen, a professor specializing in election law at the University of California at Irvine, said Tuesday\u2019s decision is an example of a state court effectively using the state constitution to set \u201csome meaningful limits\u201d on self-interested legislators seeking to preserve their own political power.\n\n\u201cAfter the Supreme Court decided the Rucho case [in June], taking federal courts out of the business of drawing districts, the question was whether there would be anything that would put the brakes on even more partisan gerrymanders in the future,\u201d Hasen said.\n\nIf Republicans had decided to appeal, there is a good chance Tuesday\u2019s ruling would stand, given that Democrats control North Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court, Hasen said. But the landscape looks different elsewhere in the country. In Wisconsin, for instance, where Republicans engaged in \u201cserious gerrymandering\u201d of legislative maps, the state Supreme Court is controlled by the GOP, Hasen noted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a state-by-state slog,\u201d he said.", "description": "The decision won praise from voting-rights advocates and opens a new front in the national battle over partisan gerrymanders.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MubKomyLia3oCHjJRrixg444FRo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AATQUIA5WAI6JG3MCLRQZPUGUM.jpg"}
