We\u2019ve just reminded her about a tweet from Cliff Bleszinski, the former lead designer on the Gears of War franchise, which she has worked on for several years. Gears 5, the latest title in the Gears of War series, has a female protagonist for the first time.\n\nGears 5 review \u2013 thrills, kills and belly laughs in a refreshing reboot Read more\n\n\u201cNot gonna lie,\u201d wrote Bleszinski. \u201cSeeing a woman on the cover of a Gears game makes me happy. I was told for decades \u2018games with female leads don\u2019t sell.\u2019\u201d When it was announced that Corporal Kait Diaz \u2013 previously a side character \u2013 would replace Marcus Fenix as the face of the studio\u2019s incredibly successful \u2013 and incredibly macho \u2013 franchise, some industry watchers saw it as a bold move. But Curnoe is tired of thinking about female leads as a risky proposition. \u201cIt\u2019d be great if we could stop talking about it to some degree,\u201d she says, \u201cand having a woman lead just becomes normal.\u201d\n\nThe theory of the female lead as commercial suicide is largely down to a spreadsheet. In 2005, when Bleszinski and Rod Fergusson were etching the first outlines of an apocalyptic sci-fi universe, decisions about what to make were driven by marketers who\u2019d \u201chave some sort of master spreadsheet where they could type in a bunch of parameters and forecast what they\u2019d think your game would do,\u201d Fergusson remembers. \u201cVideo games are long investments. You\u2019re spending millions of dollars over three, sometimes seven years \u2013 but you don\u2019t have a crystal ball telling you what\u2019s going to be right for the industry seven years from now [\u2026] There\u2019s going to be stuff they do that\u2019s risky, so there are other things that are easier to de-risk, which is \u2018well, I\u2019ll just have a white male as my lead character.\u2019 We\u2019ve moved away from that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In Gears, the hero mantle passes from series regular Marcus Fenix to Kait Diaz. Photograph: Microsoft\n\nIt\u2019s true, the 90s\u2019 Lara Croft \u2013 with her hot pants and seductively clipped consonants \u2013 may be one of our most famous female gaming icons, but she achieved this while somewhat conforming to the objectifying tastes of the era\u2019s lad culture. In recent years, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice, and the rebooted Tomb Raider, have all proven that action games can achieve commercial and critical success with nuanced women leading the story. Yet data crunched by Feminist Frequency reveals that only 7% of games featured at E3 conferences since 2015 have had female leads \u2013 over three times as many have male central heroes.\n\nHeated resistance to high-profile franchises putting women in pole position hasn\u2019t helped. \u201c#NotMyBattlefield\u201d started trending on Twitter after female soldiers were introduced to Battlefield V; a soot-flecked, dual-gun wielding woman bursting from the cover art. Most complaints were couched in concerns over \u201chistorical accuracy\u201d (despite famous female world war-era soldiers such as Lyudmila Pavlichenko and Wanda Gertz). Maker\u2019s EA Dice had to point out, \u201cThe Battlefield sandbox has always been about playing the way you want. Like attempting to fit three players on a galloping horse, with flamethrowers. With BFV, you also get the chance to play as who you want. This is #everyonesbattlefield.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The women of Gears Photograph: Microsoft\n\nRealism and escapist action dance a constant tango in video games, and Dice\u2019s defenders accused indignant fans of using history as a crutch for bigotry. The response to Kait from core Gears fans, however, has been positive. \u201c[Fans aren\u2019t] calling out that she\u2019s a female protagonist, they\u2019re calling out that they are wrapped up in her story,\u201d says franchise narrative lead Bonnie Mah. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested in Kait wholeheartedly \u2026 and just to see the reaction from our players is very rewarding and shows it was the right choice.\u201d\n\nThe community\u2019s acceptance of Kait (compared to the Battlefield V controversy or historical gripes with Total War: Rome 2\u2019s female generals) was partly due to how The Coalition exploited the game\u2019s sci-fi setting. \u201cGears as a franchise is a Star Trekkian utopia in some ways on top of an apocalypse,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cWe don\u2019t have homophobia, racism or sexism. They\u2019re fighting for their lives in a genocidal war. We don\u2019t need the humans fighting among themselves over petty things. And so it was important to Cliff and I back in 2005 that we had a diverse cast, at least ethnically, and then as we got into Gears 3 we were able to bring gender more into the forefront.\u201d\n\nThen there is Gears\u2019 strong narrative spine, which allowed the team to smoothly bend the series in this direction. It turns out, the team carefully planned Kait\u2019s ascension over a number of years, ensuring that her evolution into a central hero felt natural. Mysteries over her lineage surfaces in 2016\u2019s Gears of War 4, and this compelling narrative, fleshed out by Karen Traviss\u2019s tie-in novels, paved an unassailable route.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Fans are wrapped up in her story\u2019 Kait Diaz in Gears 5. Photograph: Microsoft\n\nKait\u2019s popularity can also be ascribed to her strength of personality. Of course the term \u201cstrong female character\u201d is amorphous and often reductive, easily used to describe a titillating twentysomething who can roundhouse kick in stilettos. For Mah, however, \u201ca strong character is someone who\u2019s authentic, who\u2019s real, who has that range of emotions, who can be vulnerable, who can show bravery and personal strength. By having Kait out there demonstrating to us what a believable character looks like, to us it naturally moves the bar.\u201d Acutely aware of the \u201csave the princess\u201d trope, the team worked hard to write Kait\u2019s story so while her fellow soldiers could support her, JD and others never had to save her.\n\nBut perhaps the key element in the establishment of Kait as an authentic lead was structural. The Coalition believes the only way to write well-rounded female characters is to have women on the development team. Current statistics suggest that women make up just 20% of game development staff worldwide. But Fergusson suggests a studio should match its audience. \u201cIn the industry now, our player base is 50/50 male and female,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you can better represent the content you want to create for your players if your studio culture represents that.\u201d\n\nCurnoe agrees: \u201cThis is probably the most inclusive culture I\u2019ve ever been a part of, and I\u2019ve been in the industry for 15 years \u2026 When you see it every day among your leaders, it trickles down and tends to spread out among the people that you work with.\u201d The Coalition\u2019s leadership endorsed Gears 5\u2019s creative direction from the beginning of the project, while the studio introduced resources to connect women across different teams, and invited the wider development community to a panel in January that Curnoe says was \u201cmade up mostly of women and non-binary people talking about diverse characters in games, and how to create that representation\u201d.\n\nFergusson says these aren\u2019t just ways to tick a box, but important steps along a path towards parity. He describes studio culture as being two-sided: the aspiration of what leadership wishes it to be, and what it actually is, based on who works there. \u201cYou have to be aware that [culture change is] not just top-down, it\u2019s also bottom-up \u2026 It\u2019s slow, because the industry is behind the curve in a lot of ways. In terms of [non-male] engineers and designers, there\u2019s just not as many as you\u2019d like there to be. But it\u2019s a good aspirational goal to have your studio look like your players.\u201d\n\nA studio that reflects its player base will also be in a better position to create characters that mean something to those fans. When that starts happening more regularly, perhaps development teams won\u2019t ever again have to explain themselves when elevating a female character to lead an action shooter franchise.", "description": "Kait Diaz is a success as the protagonist in Gears 5, but the process of getting her there went back years and involved cultural change for the game\u2019s developer", "authors": ["Alysia Judge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e267e59e9f9e58b2f85dd8a74a1bced3d3e30fa1/191_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96c3ebfef588d7ce6118dece776e2e1c", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
