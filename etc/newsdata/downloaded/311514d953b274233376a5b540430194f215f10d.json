Along with the offensive fireworks expected from a team boasting Davis and James, Los Angeles forced 23 turnovers by a talented Utah squad and won comfortably behind that gritty defense.\n\n\u201cWe are the real deal defensively,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe try to lay our hats on defense. We want to be a defensive-oriented team, and guys came in and were pesky today.\u201d\n\nDavis had already played in a regular-season game at Staples Center in a Lakers uniform while getting wildly cheered \u2014 but that happened three days earlier during the Lakers\u2019 loss in the Clippers\u2019 home opener.\n\nThe star big man is still looking for his flow, but he blocked five shots and contributed steadily on offense. James was aggressive throughout the final three quarters, bulling his way to the hoop and sliding away from defenders in another impressive two-way game.\n\n\u201cHe was just locked in and had a really good night in both halves, but particularly in the second half,\u201d Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel said.\n\nDonovan Mitchell scored 24 points for the Jazz, who played without injured newcomer Bojan Bogdanovic. Utah has committed 34 turnovers in its first two games.\n\nJeff Green had five points while starting in place of Bogdanovic, Utah\u2019s $73 million free agent acquisition. The Jazz beat Oklahoma City in their opener, but didn\u2019t have enough offense to compete with the new-look Lakers and their solid defensive schemes.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about our offense all preseason and how it was good, and our defense was bad,\u201d Utah coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cNow our offense hasn\u2019t been good. \u2026 There\u2019s a part of it that you\u2019re getting connected and things like that, but there\u2019s also part of it where we just need to be stronger with the ball. We need to be more decisive. We need to be more precise.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers never trailed after the opening minutes, and they took firm control with a strong third quarter featuring 12 points from James and three 3-pointers from Daniels, the proficient outside shooter acquired specifically to knock down spot-up 3s.\n\nLos Angeles opened the third quarter with a small lineup using Davis as its center to minimize the defensive impact of Utah big man Rudy Gobert, and it worked splendidly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give credit to the Lakers, too,\u201d said Mike Conley, who had 13 points on 3-of-11 shooting. \u201cThey defended us the way they wanted to, but a lot of it is us learning each other. Us learning guys. Who\u2019s handling the ball? Who\u2019s running? Who\u2019s in different lanes?\u201d\n\nDWIGHT RETURNS\n\nDwight Howard heard a few boos when he checked in for his first home game back with the Lakers, whom he spurned in free agency in 2013 after one tumultuous season. He had been booed relentlessly for six years since \u2014 but in his return as Los Angeles\u2019 backup center, Howard played a strong defensive game and earned cheers by the second half with his obvious effort.\n\nDANNY SPEAKS\n\nDanny Green had nine points after scoring 28 against the Clippers in his Lakers debut earlier this week. The veteran who won a ring with Toronto last season also took the microphone before the game and told cheering fans: \u201cI promise we\u2019ll do better than last year.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nJazz: Bogdanovic sat out after rolling his left ankle in Utah\u2019s season opener Wednesday. He returned in the second half of that win over Oklahoma City, scoring nine of his 16 points on a bad ankle. \u2026 Joe Ingles started and scored just two points after Royce O\u2019Neale started the opener.\n\nLakers: G Rajon Rondo missed his second straight game with a sore right calf. He will return soon, and F Kyle Kuzma will be right behind him. Kuzma didn\u2019t participate in training camp while recovering from a left ankle injury incurred during the summer, but he is participating in 4-on-4 drills and other activities.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJazz: Host the Sacramento Kings on Saturday.\n\nLakers: Host the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_NBA", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Less than 90 seconds into the game, Anthony Davis leaped and slammed home an alley-oop pass from LeBron James for the first points of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/25/1ced4a_jazz-lakers-basketball-00258-los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-left-drives-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
