Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). \u201cShameful!\u201d added Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). \u201cThe NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cThis is a mistake that they should fix quickly,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).\n\nTrying to clean up this mess, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a 354-word statement this morning. \u201cI recognize our initial statement left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for. Let me be more clear,\u201d he wrote. \u201cValues of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2013 and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game. \u2026 It is inevitable that people around the world \u2013 including from America and China \u2013 will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\nBut the league still finds itself under fire from both sides of the Pacific Ocean. Chinese entities are canceling sponsorships and the state television broadcaster is threatening not to air games, endangering a very lucrative revenue stream. To curry their favor, the NBA posted a statement on Monday in Mandarin that \u2013 when translated \u2013 went even further than the English-language apology. (The NBA denies that this was intentional.) The owner of the Rockets said his general manager \u201cdoes NOT speak for the\u201d team. And the team\u2019s biggest star went further. \u201cWe apologize,\u201d said Rockets star James Harden, who was the NBA\u2019s MVP in 2018 and has traveled to China to promote his brand of Adidas sneakers. \u201cWe love China. \u2026 We love everything they\u2019re about.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke and Ted Cruz don\u2019t agree on much, but this groveling has gone way too far for the Texans who battled each other for Senate last year. \u201cThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman now running for president. \u201cWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship,\u201d said Cruz, a diehard Rockets fan, who beat O\u2019Rourke in the midterms.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget in the Trump era that there is still something resembling a Washington consensus. President Trump has made clear, through his words and deeds, that he does not believe the U.S. government should prioritize the promotion of democracy and human rights in foreign policy. But this position puts him at odds with the bulk of lawmakers in both major parties. With few exceptions, most members of Congress \u2013 including Cruz \u2013 see the United States as a beacon of freedom and believe that the spread of democracy makes the world safer. Taking the long view, they recognize that promoting democracy and human rights is squarely in the national interest. While veteran Republicans are nervous to challenge Trump frontally or critique his worldview directly, they still believe in the Wilsonian framework and came of age listening to Ronald Reagan speak poignantly about America as the shining city upon a hill.\n\nIf questioned, many everyday Americans would probably say they are uncomfortable with society prioritizing dollars over democracy \u2013 even though, all too often, it does. Profit without principle, however common, is not a core American value. That\u2019s why criticizing the NBA has been so cathartic for so many in Congress. In what\u2019s been a period of moral relativism, Monday brought a refreshing moment of moral clarity. \u201cBasketball fans and the American people more broadly should have absolutely no doubt about what is happening here,\u201d said Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.). \u201cThe NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights. In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.\u201d\n\nMonday brought the kind of bipartisan bonhomie that has become so unusual, especially against the backdrop of the impeachment inquiry. \u201cChina is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S.,\u201d tweeted Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and Barack Obama\u2019s housing secretary. \u201cThe United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\u201d\n\n\u201cJuli\u00e1n, glad to agree with you on this one,\u201d replied Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.).\n\nAnd many Republicans who have been mealy-mouthed on Trump\u2019s many apostasies strongly criticized the NBA and China. Rubio drew a distinction between his refusal to criticize Trump for asking China to investigate Joe Biden (he insists the president was joking) and upbraiding the NBA for currying favor with China:\n\nThe brave #BlueCheckBrigade has trouble distinguishing between what is inappropriate & what is dangerous.\n\n\n\nPOTUS asking #China to investigate Biden is wrong, but it isn\u2019t going to happen.\n\n\n\nChina regulating speech in America is dangerous & is actually happening via @NBA \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\n-- The NBA donnybrook has spotlighted how many corporations routinely sell out to China to fatten their bottom lines. Sports columnist Sally Jenkins argues that the attacks on the NBA by politicians of both parties are \u201cmore than a little ludicrous\u201d because \u201cliterally hundreds of American companies\u201d have been \u201ctoadying to authoritarians in Beijing\u201d for years. \u201cA half-dozen American corporate sponsors set the template a decade ago at the Beijing Olympics, when they colluded in the silencing of U.S. athletes and were far more directly complicit in a host of human rights violations,\u201d she writes. \u201cRemember what champs Visa and General Electric were when the Chinese refused to grant entry to American athlete Joey Cheek because he had been too audible of an activist against abuses in Darfur? And how about the courageous support Coca-Cola gave to Chinese dissidents when Beijing authorities cracked down on them in advance of those Games?\n\n\u201cNever forget the standup position Johnson & Johnson took when Steven Spielberg quit as artistic director of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies because Beijing not only failed to honor a single one of the reform promises it had made in procuring the right to host the Games but actually went on a terroristic bender against its own citizens, destroying whole neighborhoods, enlisting slave labor and throwing anyone who didn\u2019t like it into a camp. \u2026 Throughout the Beijing Olympics, American companies remained silent. So did IOC President Jacques Rogge. When Rogge finally did open his mouth to protest someone\u2019s conduct, it wasn\u2019t anyone in China\u2019s leaderships. The man he decided to pick was Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, for his bad manners in celebrating too boldly. The outrage at the NBA is more than a little remindful of that.\u201d\n\n-- But the NBA is supposed to be more than just a business. It\u2019s a symbol of America. Just because so many other companies kowtow to the communists for cash doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s become morally acceptable. Part of the reason this controversy has blown up so much is because of the rank hypocrisy: The NBA has gotten so much credit from the left and minority groups over the last few years because of its commitment to social justice and racial equality, at least compared to the National Football League.\n\nAs Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) recalled in a letter he sent to Silver on Monday afternoon: \u201cNot so long ago you said that the NBA is more than just a basketball league. Your comment was, \u2018I think in this day and age, you really do have to stand for something.\u2019 Let me remind you what the people of Hong Kong are standing for. For five months now, Hong Kong\u2019s citizens have been calling for representative government and preservation of their basic liberties. In response, and at the instruction of the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of Hong Kong has engaged in escalating repression. The government has sought emergency powers and deployed riot police to put down the protests, often violently. Police have employed tear gas, batons, water cannons with dye, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against their own people. Thousands have been hospitalized and arrested. Some may even have paid with their lives.\u201d\n\nHawley is calling on the NBA to cancel all exhibition games in China \u201cpending a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Hong Kong\u201d and to formally apologize. \u201cRemember that some things are more important than money,\u201d the freshman senator wrote to Silver, carbon copying the owners of all 30 NBA franchises. \u201cRemember your responsibility. You may not think of your league as an American undertaking, but whatever you think, what you say and do represents America to the world. And for an American organization to help the most brutal of regimes silence dissent in pursuit of profit is appalling.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.) pleaded with Silver in his own open letter to take \u201ccorrective action\u201d to do more to clean up Sunday\u2019s \u201cshameful\u201d apology. \u201cWith democracy under threat in Hong Kong, throughout Europe, and even here in America, our ability to stand for our values will have a direct impact on the preservation of freedom,\u201d Pascrell wrote. \u201cA citizen of America, the NBA cannot divorce itself from that burden.\u201d\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver, second from left, watches a basketball game last month in Beijing. (Mark Schiefelbein/AP)\n\n-- The Post\u2019s Editorial Board says it is \u201cpathetic\u201d how quickly the NBA chose to apologize, \u201cessentially importing to the United States China\u2019s denial of free speech\u201d: \u201cThe NBA is big business in China \u2026 But that\u2019s the point. China is attempting to enforce its version of the truth all around the world \u2014 bullying Chinese-language newspapers in Canada and the United States, patrolling the speech of its students abroad, demanding that foreign airlines and hotel chains wipe Taiwan off their maps. Some of its targets don\u2019t have the wherewithal to stand up to this assault \u2014 which is why the NBA\u2019s cravenness is so damaging. With all its financial muscle, its enormous popularity and its moral preening, if the NBA can cave so easily, who will resist the censorship of the Communist dictators?\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe NBA is only the latest Chinese government hostage,\u201d laments national security columnist Josh Rogin: \u201cJust last week, China\u2019s foreign minister Wang Yi said, \u2018China will not interfere in the internal affairs of the U.S.\u2019 This is Chinese interference in our affairs. If we don\u2019t stand up to it now, we will soon find ourselves living in an America where everyone self-censors and nobody is allowed to speak out on things that are obviously outrageous, like Chinese repression in Hong Kong. But U.S. companies are not strong enough to resist Chinese government coercion on their own. The U.S. government needs to do much more to make sure U.S. companies don\u2019t have to abandon their values at the point of an economic gun.\u201d\n\n-- The Wall Street Journal reported overnight on the kind of American leadership that can make a difference: \u201cThe U.S. added 28 Chinese entities to an export blacklist Monday, citing their role in Beijing's repression of Muslim minorities in northwest Chin \u2026 Targets of the action include video-surveillance and facial-recognition giants Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Megvii Technology Inc. and SenseTime Group Ltd. The decision by the Commerce Department to add the firms to its 'entity list' alongside telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.\u2014which was added in May\u2014means suppliers will be barred from providing technology that originates in the U.S. to the Chinese firms without a license. The newly identified entities 'have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups' in northwest China's Xinjiang region, the Commerce Department said.\u201d\n\n-- Beijing quickly demanded Washington lift these new sanctions, the Associated Press reports, but announced this morning that negotiators will still go ahead with their planned trip to Washington for trade talks later this week.\n\nPresident Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 29. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\n-- \u201cWith the politically charged trade war with the United States grinding on and the Chinese economy cooling off, the latest NBA controversy was a reminder that many foreign executives say the country of 400 million middle-class consumers is more a minefield than a gold mine,\u201d Gerry Shih reports from Beijing. \u201cJoerg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, said the boycott against the Rockets was a familiar pressure tactic. \u2018It is unfortunately a part of the Chinese toolbox to hold foreign companies hostage,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, a Chinese government-led boycott crippled the South Korean retail conglomerate Lotte after the company allowed a U.S. missile defense system to be installed on its land. In the years since, threats of boycotts seemed to surface on a regular basis. Mercedes-Benz was labeled an \u2018enemy of the people\u2019 following an Instagram post quoting the Dalai Lama, whom many Chinese consider a separatist. Marriott sparked outrage because it listed Taiwan as a country, when many Chinese consider it a territory of the People\u2019s Republic. Leica, the camera maker, had to apologize for celebrating the legacy of photojournalists who covered the Tiananmen crisis, a taboo subject.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe political risk is so high right now it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep investing in China. If you\u2019re not already here, you have to think three, four, five times harder about whether it\u2019s worth coming,\u201d said Shaun Rein, the Shanghai-based founder of the China Market Research Group who has advised clients such as Apple, Samsung, Fidelity Investments and luxury group Richemont. Rein, an author known in China for his pro-Beijing views and support for hard-line President Xi Jinping, told Shih that the political atmosphere had become so charged that even he is advising companies to leave. \u201cIt\u2019s killing my business, frankly,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t put all your eggs in this basket anymore.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE IN YOUR MORNING MEETINGS:\n\n-- The Trump administration this morning blocked a planned deposition from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a central figure in the impeachment inquiry, according to a statement by his lawyer. Shane Harris and John Wagner report: \u201cSondland was scheduled to be deposed on Tuesday morning before House committees seeking information about his activities as Trump urged Ukraine to investigate his political opponents, according to his lawyer, Robert Luskin. \u2026 Sondland was willing to testify and didn\u2019t appear on Tuesday at the direction of the State Department, Luskin said. \u2018As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the Department\u2019s direction,\u2019 Luskin said.\u201d Democrats say the administration\u2019s move is itself an act of obstruction and accused Trump of trying to cover up his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rivals.\n\n-- A new Washington Post-Schar School poll, in the field through Sunday night, shows that a 58 percent majority of Americans support the decision to begin an impeachment inquiry into Trump. \u201cNearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step and recommend that the president be removed from office,\u201d Dan Balz and Scott Clement report:\n\n\u201cMore than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal. Among the critical voting bloc of independents, support for the impeachment inquiry hits 57 percent, with 49 percent saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office. Since a July poll by The Post and ABC, there has been movement toward an impeachment inquiry among all three groups, with support for the inquiry rising by 25 points among Democrats, 21 points among Republicans and 20 points among independents. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe survey finds cracks within the Republican coalition on the question of support for the impeachment inquiry, with younger and more moderate Republicans offering greater support. Overall, 25 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents support the impeachment inquiry. Broken down by ideology, 41 percent of moderate-to-liberal Republicans say they favor the inquiry compared with 16 percent of conservatives, who make up the majority of the party. Broken down by age groups, 40 percent of Republican-leaning adults ages 18-39 endorse the start of the impeachment inquiry, compared with 23 percent of those ages 40-64 and 13 percent of those age 65 and older.\u201d\n\nAsked about the contents of Trump\u2019s telephone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, 62 percent say Trump\u2019s request to investigate Joe Biden and his son was inappropriate (compared to 32 percent who felt it was not): \u201cAsked whether the president upholds adequate standards for ethics in government, 60 percent of Americans say he does not, while 35 percent say he does.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s attacks seem to be taking a toll on Biden: Asked whether the former vice president would uphold adequate ethics standards in government if he\u2019s elected president, 47 percent said yes, while 38 percent said no. The results were split among partisan lines, with 72 percent of Democrats saying Biden would uphold ethical standards, while 63 percent of Republicans say he would not.\n\nBREAKING NEWS:\n\nThe 2019 #NobelPrize in Physics has been awarded with one half to James Peebles \u201cfor theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology\u201d and the other half jointly to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz \u201cfor the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star.\u201d pic.twitter.com/BwwMTwtRFv \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 8, 2019\n\n-- A cosmologist who revealed the universe was made mostly of invisible matter and energy and two scientists who detected the first planet orbiting an alien star were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. Sarah Kaplan reports: \u201cBy studying the afterglow of radiation left over from the universe\u2019s birth, James Peebles of Princeton developed a theoretical framework for the evolution of the cosmos that led to the discovery of dark energy and dark matter \u2014 substances that can\u2019t be observed by any scientific instruments but nonetheless comprise 95 percent of the universe. Fellow laureates Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz revolutionized astronomy, the Nobel Committee said, when in 1995 they announced the discovery of a large, gaseous world circling a star 50 lightyears from our own sun \u2014 the very first extrasolar planet around a solar-type star. In the decades since, scientists have found thousands more of these exoplanets, and astronomers now think our universe contains more planets than stars.\u201d\n\nStarting pitcher Max Scherzer, right, high-fives first baseman Ryan Zimmerman after finishing the seventh inning at Nats Park on Monday night. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\n-- The Nationals beat the Dodgers, 6-1, in a do-or-die Game 4, because Max Scherzer was dominant and the offense finally clicked.

Isabelle Khurshudyan reports: \u201cIt\u2019s a scenario they\u2019ve been in before and are comfortable with, specifically against Washington. Los Angeles will have right-hander Walker Buehler on the mound Wednesday night, hopeful he can repeat his masterful performance from the first game of this series, when he pitched six scoreless innings and surrendered just one hit. The Dodgers won 59 games at Dodger Stadium this season, the second most for any home team in the majors. \u2018It would\u2019ve been great to finish that off here,\u2019 center fielder Cody Bellinger said. \u2018But at home with Buehler going, I like our chances.\u2019\u201d\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Trump faced a torrent of Republican rebukes over his plan to withdraw troops from northeast Syria, a move even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said would undermine U.S. national security and potentially bolster Islamic State terrorists. Toluse Olorunnipa and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cMcConnell (R-Ky.), in a rare public split with Trump, said that a supermajority in the Senate disagreed with the president\u2019s abrupt withdrawal announcement, raising the specter of veto-proof action to oppose the decision. \u2026 McConnell referenced a January vote in which 68 senators rebuked Trump\u2019s threat to withdraw troops from Syria, a large-enough total to override a presidential veto. \u2018The conditions that produced that bipartisan vote still exist today,\u2019 he said. \u2026 The White House statement on Sunday announcing the withdrawal appeared to catch even the most senior levels of congressional leadership off guard.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) will introduce new sanctions targeting Turkey if Turkish forces invaded Syria. \"So sad. So dangerous,\" Graham tweeted. \"Trump may be tired of fighting radical Islam. They are NOT tired of fighting us.\"\n\n-- Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said they will seek congressional hearings \u201cas soon as possible\u201d on Trump\u2019s decision: \u201cBarring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests,\u201d Murphy and Romney said.\n\n-- Rand Paul seemed like the only Senate Republican who was happy about Trump's move. The isolationist senator from Kentucky blasted Graham, Rubio and Romney for being part of what he called \"the neocon war caucus\" of the Senate. \"They always want to stay at war,\" Paul said on Fox News.\n\n-- Syrian Kurds said Trump\u2019s betrayal is a boon to the Islamic State. Liz Sly, Sarah Dadouch and Asser Khattab report: \u201cIt remains unclear how extensive the U.S. troop drawdown or a Turkish incursion will be. A small number of U.S. troops pulled out Tuesday from two observation posts on the Turkish border, in the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, that were established this year in an effort to create a buffer zone along the border in cooperation with Turkey. From Turkey\u2019s perspective, the U.S. partnership with the Kurds has always represented an affront to its decades-old NATO alliance with the United States. The People\u2019s Protection Units, the Kurdish group that dominates the SDF, is closely affiliated with the Kurdish PKK, which has been waging a decades-long insurgency in Turkey and is labeled a terrorist organization by both Ankara and Washington. ...\n\n\u201cKurdish officials say they are hoping they can prevent, or at least delay, a full departure of U.S. troops from Syria. A complete withdrawal would leave the Kurds at the mercy not only of invading Turks to the north but also of Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian troops to the south, while facing the efforts of the Islamic State to reconstitute its insurgency. \u2026 U.S. and Kurdish officials say it is their understanding that U.S. troops will remain in Syria south of the area along the border that Turkey is threatening to invade. Outside this border zone are overwhelmingly Arab areas where the risk of an Islamic State comeback is most grave.\"\n\n-- Privately, according to an adviser, Trump \u201cjust wants out\u201d of Syria. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be there. He doesn\u2019t want to pay,\u201d the adviser told Josh Dawsey. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe any of his advisers that tell him that [the Kurds] are in jeopardy, that [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan will kill them. The president has always professed to believe that Turkey and Erdogan\u2019s \u2026 massive military capability can contain ISIS.\"\n\n-- Publicly, Trump promised to restrain Turkey and invoked his own \"great and unmatched wisdom\":\n\n....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n-- A National Security Council official said Trump got \u201crolled\u201d by Erdogan. \u201cThe U.S. national security has entered a state of increased danger for decades to come because the president has no spine and that's the bottom line,\u201d this official told Newsweek.\n\n-- The U.S. announcement caught Israeli leaders by complete surprise, per Haaretz.\n\n-- Commentary:\n\nAnti-government protesters set fires and close a street during a demonstration in Baghdad. (Khalid Mohammed/AP)\n\n-- The Iraqi military admitted to using \u201cexcessive force\u201d in crackdowns against protesters. Louisa Loveluck and Mustafa Salim report: \u201cSecurity forces have killed more than 100 people since protests erupted in Baghdad and southern cities last week, according to the Iraqi military. Hospitals have overflowed with more than 6,000 wounded. \u2026 In a televised speech, Iraqi President Barham Salih condemned \u2018unacceptable\u2019 attacks on both protesters and the media, and he urged security forces to preserve the rights of all Iraqis.\"\n\n-- Extinction Rebellion, a radical arm of the climate-change protest movement, kicked off two weeks of planned protests designed to shut down dozens of cities around the world. Activists blocked roads in central London, obstructed a major roundabout in Berlin, spilled fake blood on Wall Street\u2019s \u201cCharging Bull\u201d and staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d in New Zealand. Karla Adam reports: \u201cThe group\u2019s message is that climate change is an emergency that requires drastic and immediate action. And it has already seen some success. \u2018Extinction Rebellion is widely credited with accelerating policy change in the U.K.,\u2019 said Robert Falkner, a fellow at Chatham House, a think tank.\"\n\n-- Jennifer Arcuri, an American businesswoman and former model, declined to answer nine times if she had an affair with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Arcuri is currently at the center of an investigation into how she managed to accompany Johnson on government-sponsored trade missions. William Booth reports: \u201cThe story has been competing with Brexit headlines for a week in Britain, because Arcuri won sponsorship and grants from the British government while she was Johnson\u2019s friend. \u2026 In her first broadcast interview since her ties to Johnson were reported, Arcuri told ITV\u2019s \u2018Good Morning Britain\u2019 show that when Johnson was mayor, he visited her apartment in east London a \u2018handful of times,\u2019 somewhere between five and 10. \u2026 Arcuri was asked multiple times by the morning show host whether she had a romantic relationship with Johnson. She declined to answer.\u201d\n\n-- An American diplomat\u2019s wife claimed immunity and fled the U.K. after killing a British teen in a wrong-way collision, police say. Meagan Flynn and Jennifer Hassan report: \u201cJohnson said Monday that he hoped the woman, who has been identified as 42-year-old Anne Sacoolas, would return to Britain to face justice. \u2026 The death sparked widespread outrage after authorities revealed that Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity under international law, allowing her to avoid prosecution \u2026 Under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, family members of diplomats living in other countries are covered by immunity, allowing them to avoid arrest for virtually any crime and escape civil liability in most circumstances. However, the diplomat\u2019s home country can also choose to waive immunity.\u201d\n\nIMPEACHMENT LATEST:\n\n-- State Department employees are increasingly demoralized and resentful under Mike Pompeo\u2019s leadership, amid a growing belief he has subordinated its mission and abandoned colleagues in the service of Trump\u2019s political aims. Karen DeYoung, John Hudson, Josh Dawsey and Ellen Nakashima report:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018prevailing mood is low and getting lower, if it can,\u2019 said Thomas R. Pickering, a diplomatic dean who served in high-ranking department positions and held seven ambassadorships, including to Russia and the United Nations, under six presidents of both parties. State Department officials strongly supported $141 million in department funds that Congress appropriated this year for Ukraine \u2014 in addition to $250 million in aid from the Defense Department. But there is no indication that Pompeo objected when Trump withheld all of the assistance while Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 and the president himself \u2014 pressed the government of [Ukraine] to investigate [the Bidens]. \u2026 Several people with direct knowledge of events said Pompeo was regularly informed by State Department diplomats of Giuliani\u2019s activities regarding Ukraine. \u2026\n\n\u201cMost worrisome to the department is concern that Pompeo did not intervene to protect U.S. diplomats either enlisted by Giuliani to assist his efforts or punished for being insufficiently committed to the cause, according to more than a dozen current and former officials \u2026 Trump, according to Giuliani, ordered that career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch be fired as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and she was removed from her post in May. \u2026 Officials in the department say accusations against Yovanovitch were baseless and in late March began suggesting ways the State Department could defend her. \u2026 Diplomats who worked closely with Yovanovitch say the State Department and Pompeo did far too little to protect her.\u201d\n\n-- House Democrats are considering masking the identity of the first whistleblower from Trump\u2019s Republican allies in Congress. Rachael Bade, Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima and Karoun Demirjian report: \u201cThe steps under consideration include having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual\u2019s appearance and voice ... The efforts reflect Democrats\u2019 deepening distrust of their GOP colleagues, whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower\u2019s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans. ... Democrats on Monday subpoenaed Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Office of Management and Budget acting director Russell Vought for documents related to the withholding of U.S. military aid from Ukraine.\u201d\n\n-- Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine who resigned two weeks ago and sat for a 10-hour deposition last week, stepped down from his post as executive director of Arizona State University\u2019s McCain Institute for International Leadership, reports the Arizona Republic.\n\n-- Mitt Romney will not challenge Trump in the primary, but an unnamed \"confidant\" to the Utah senator told Vanity Fair he is \"the one guy who could bring along Susan Collins, Cory Gardner and Ben Sasse\": \u201cRomney has also told people that, as an unsuccessful two-time presidential candidate, he\u2019s the wrong person to take on Trump. Instead, a Romney adviser told me, Romney believes he has more potential power as a senator who will decide Trump\u2019s fate in an impeachment trial. \u2018He could have tremendous influence in the impeachment process as the lone voice of conscience in the Republican caucus,\u2019 the adviser said. In recent days, Romney has been reaching out privately to key players in the Republican resistance.\u201d\n\n-- Ohio Sen. Rob Portman joined the group of Republicans willing to say that what Trump did to Ukraine was wrong. From the Columbus Dispatch: \u201c\u2018The president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period. It\u2019s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent,\u2019 Portman said \u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t view it as an impeachable offense \u2026 I think the House frankly rushed to impeachment assuming certain things\u2019 that haven\u2019t panned out yet, said Portman, who as a House member voted exactly 21 years ago to impeach President Bill Clinton. Portman did express openness to an investigation of Trump by a bipartisan group such as the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u2018Everything should be looked at,\u2019 he said, including accusations that the FBI was politicized in 2016 to go after Trump.\u201d\n\n-- A federal judge dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit seeking to block the Manhattan district attorney from obtaining the president\u2019s tax returns as part of the investigation into hush-money payments allegedly made during the 2016 campaign. David A. Fahrenthold and Ann E. Marimow report: \u201cThat decision does not mean Trump\u2019s tax returns will be handed over immediately. Trump appealed within minutes, and an appeals court put the case on hold until it can hear the president\u2019s challenge. But Monday\u2019s ruling by U.S. Judge Victor Marrero was still a broad rejection of Trump\u2019s precedent-shattering argument in this case. The president argued that, as long as he is president, he cannot be investigated by any prosecutor, anywhere, for any reason. Marrero said that was \u2018repugnant\u2019 to an American ideal as old as the Constitution: that no man, even a president, is above the law.\u201d\n\nTHE NON-IMPEACHMENT AGENDA:\n\n-- E-cigarettes and the rechargeable batteries that power them are causing smoke or fire incidents on airplanes, and safety experts say federal regulators have struggled to keep up. Michael Laris reports: \u201cIn addition to the e-cigarette incidents, the FAA recorded more than 65 other cases of smoking, sparking and flaming lithium-ion batteries in laptops, tablets, phones and other devices, including power packs, drill batteries and rechargeable socks, according to a Washington Post analysis of FAA data, which the agency acknowledged is incomplete. \u2018We think that\u2019s a pretty significant threat,\u2019 said Mark Millam, vice president of technical programs at the Flight Safety Foundation and a former safety chief at Northwest Airlines. \u2018It\u2019s gone from one to multiple devices that most passengers are carrying on. You don\u2019t know where all these things are coming from and what\u2019s in them and how legitimate they are.\u2019 \u2026 Some advocates \u2014 and even some inside the airline industry \u2014 say federal regulators have not been aggressive enough in addressing the risks. \u2026 About a quarter of the incidents involving e-cigarettes, and half of those involving other electronics, happened in the air, the FAA data shows, elevating safety concerns.\u201d\n\n-- A whistleblower, this time in Ethiopia, filed a complaint with American regulators alleging that Ethiopian Airlines went into the maintenance records of the Boeing 737 Max jet a day after the crash earlier this year. From the AP: \u201cYonas Yeshanew, who resigned this summer and is seeking asylum in the U.S., said that while it is unclear what, if anything, in the records was altered, the decision to go into them at all when they should have been sealed reflects a government-owned airline with few boundaries and plenty to hide. \u2018The brutal fact shall be exposed ... Ethiopian Airlines is pursuing the vision of expansion, growth and profitability by compromising safety,\u2019 Yeshanew said in his report, which he gave to The Associated Press after sending it last month to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other international air safety agencies. Yeshanew\u2019s criticism of Ethiopian\u2019s maintenance practices, backed by three other former employees who spoke to AP, makes him the latest voice urging investigators to take a closer look at potential human factors in the Max saga and not just focus on Boeing\u2019s faulty anti-stall system, which has been blamed in two crashes in four months.\u201d\n\n-- People have been lining up outside the Supreme Court since Friday to secure seats for today's oral arguments on whether federal law forbids discrimination against workers because of their sexual orientation or gender. Robert Barnes reports: The court's new term opened yesterday with a Louisiana case about whether a jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous and another about whether Kansas and other states must allow an insanity defense for criminal defendants. \u201cThe justices experimented Monday with allowing the advocates making arguments two minutes of uninterrupted time before jumping in to ask them questions. Both the lawyers and the justices seemed a little uneasy with the arrangement. \u2026 [The justices] seemed inclined to rule that jury verdicts must be unanimous. Only two states, Louisiana and Oregon, allow convictions on variations such as 10-2 or 11-1. And Louisiana voters approved a referendum requiring unanimous votes after Jan. 1, 2019. ...\n\n\"The Kansas case involved whether a state may do away with the insanity defense, which bars holding someone criminally responsible when mental illness prevents them knowing right from wrong. James Kraig Kahler killed four family members, including his estranged wife and two teenage daughters, in 2009. He was convicted and sentenced to death. His lawyers said severe depression over the breakup of his marriage rendered him incapable of forming the intent to convict him of capital murder. But Kansas, where the murders occurred, is one of only a few states that have gotten rid of insanity as a defense to avoid conviction.\"\n\n-- The cases on LGBTQ rights are the first that the court will hear since the retirement of Anthony Kennedy, who was a decisive vote for gay rights, and the addition of Brett Kavanaugh. From the AP: \"The justices will first hear appeals in lawsuits filed by Gerald Lynn Bostock, who claims he lost his job working for Clayton County, Georgia, after he began playing in a gay recreational softball league. He lost his case in federal district court and at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Skydiving instructor Donald Zarda was fired shortly [after] telling a woman he was preparing to take on a dive that he was gay. Zarda, who worked for Altitude Express on New York\u2019s Long Island, said he would sometimes reveal his sexual orientation to allay concerns women might have about being strapped together during a dive. Zarda initially lost his lawsuit, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for him. Zarda has since died.\"\n\n-- Three presidential electors in Washington state who voted for Colin Powell in 2016 rather than Hillary Clinton and were fined under state law asked the Supreme Court to take up their appeal and decide whether a state can bind an elector to vote for the state\u2019s popular vote winner. From CNN: \u201cIf the Supreme Court agrees to hear the appeal of the so-called \u2018faithless electors,\u2019 it could thrust the justices into yet another high-passion political fight in the heat of the 2020 presidential election. \u2026 \u2018The issue is undeniably important: presidential elections in the Electoral College will be increasingly close, and could literally turn upon whether electors have a constitutionally protected discretion,\u2019 Lawrence Lessig, a lawyer for the so-called \u2018faithless electors,\u2019 told the justices in court papers.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump administration told federal agencies to carry out directives aimed at restricting the role of unions in the federal workplace now that a court ban against many of those policies has been lifted. Eric Yoder reports: \u201cMost of the provisions at issue involve topics of importance in workplaces with union bargaining units, including to limit the topics on which bargaining will be held, set time limits on negotiations and significantly reduce \u2018official time,\u2019 which is paid time that employees may use for certain union-related purposes, and other accommodations to unions such as free use of office space. The unions still have the option of a further appeal to the Supreme Court, but for the meantime the focus will shift to the bargaining table and then to the [Federal Labor Relations Authority].\"\n\n-- Roughly 40 state attorneys general plan to participate in the New York-led antitrust investigation of Facebook. Tony Romm reports: \u201cThe heightened interest \u2014 confirmed Monday by three people familiar with the matter \u2014 comes weeks after New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) first announced a wide-ranging probe with seven other states and the District of Columbia to explore whether, in James\u2019s words at the time, Facebook has \u2018endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices, or increased the price of advertising.\u2019 \u2026 The people said that New York continues to solicit support from other states, meaning the number could grow before it is formally announced.\"\n\n-- An inmate secretly recorded the gruesome reality of life inside one of Florida\u2019s notoriously dangerous prisons. Deanna Paul reports: \u201cFor four years, [Scott Whitney, a] 34-year-old convicted drug trafficker captured daily life on contraband cameras at the Martin Correctional Institution. He smuggled footage dating back to 2017 out of the prison and titled the documentary \u2018Behind Tha Barb Wire.\u2019 The video \u2014 given to the Miami Herald \u2014 allows the public to see with their own eyes the violence, rampant drug use and appalling conditions inside the prison. \u2026 From scene to scene, Whitney\u2019s footage revealed an unkempt and decaying environment and demonstrates a lack of attention by some corrections officers. In one nighttime video narrated by Whitney in a hushed voice, a guard passed by his prison cell carrying a flashlight, yet never glanced inside. He remained oblivious to Whitney, who was openly filming at the time. \u2018They don\u2019t check to see if we\u2019re living,\u2019 [Whitney said].\"\n\n-- The judge who presided over the case of that Dallas police officer who shot and killed a black man defended the hug she gave the defendant after she was convicted of murder. Reis Thebault reports: \u201cJudge Tammy Kemp \u2026 watched last week as the brother of Botham Jean \u2026 crossed the room to hug Amber Guyger, the white former police officer \u2026 Minutes later, after she dismissed the jury, Kemp hugged members of the Jean family. She then approached Guyger and, eventually, gifted her a Bible and embraced her, too. Both moments went viral, and Kemp\u2019s highly unusual act elicited a split-screen response. \u2026 In her first interview since the trial ended, Kemp \u2026 defended herself and said she didn\u2019t know why people were upset. Guyger asked her for the hug, she said. Kemp hesitated, then leaned in and put her arms around Guyger, who had just been sentenced to 10 years in prison. \u2018Following my own convictions, I could not refuse that woman a hug. I would not,\u2019 Kemp [said.]\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump's former ambassador to the U.N. spoke out against the decision to remove troops from Syria without naming the president:\n\nWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back.
