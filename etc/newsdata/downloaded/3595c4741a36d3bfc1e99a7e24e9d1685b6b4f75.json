(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nThe past three U.S. government shutdowns have cost taxpayers roughly $4 billion, according to an incomplete tally released Tuesday following a months-long bipartisan congressional investigation.\n\nA report detailed at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue and late fees on interest payments.\n\nThe tally was based on a survey of 26 federal agencies but did not include data from some of the largest government agencies, including the departments of Defense, Agriculture, Justice and Commerce, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThose agencies were unable to provide complete shutdown cost estimates, according to the report by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which is chaired by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio).\n\n\u201cRather than saving taxpayer money, shutdowns produce significant costs to the American taxpayer,\u201d said the report, which noted that Congress has routinely provided full back pay to federal workers who were furloughed and unable to work.\n\nThe report estimates the collective lost productivity of the furloughed workers at the surveyed agencies as 56,938 years.\n\nThe report covers three government shutdowns from the past five years: 16 days in October 2013 during the Obama administration; three days in January 2018 during the Trump administration; and, most recently, a record 35 days in December 2018 and January 2019 during the Trump administration.\n\nThe 180-page report details numerous government functions that were suspended during the shutdowns, including investigations of \u201cbad actors who were potentially breaking federal laws\u201d by agencies including the Justice Department.\n\nOther impacts noted in the report from the most recent shutdown include the cancellation of about 60,000 immigration hearings; delays in decisions on potentially dangerous consumer products; closed and unattended national parks; and closed Smithsonian museums, which resulted in a loss of \u201csignificant revenue from its on-site shops, theaters and dining facilities.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "A Senate subcommittee surveyed federal agencies about the impacts of three shutdowns over the past five years.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Am", "John Wagner Is A National Reporter Who Leads The Post'S New Breaking Political News Team.
