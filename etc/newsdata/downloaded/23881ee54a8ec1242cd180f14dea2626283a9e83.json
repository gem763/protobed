Nah, I\u2019ll just do my job and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll focus on.\u201d\n\nRead will captain the All Blacks for the 52nd and last time, overtaking former hooker Sean Fitzpatrick in second place on the all-time list behind Richie McCaw.\n\nBut he admitted to still being haunted by his side\u2019s failure to repel a rampaging England in Saturday\u2019s blockbuster semi-final ahead of a fixture against Wales the All Blacks could largely do without.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a weird few days,\u201d he said after New Zealand\u2019s first World Cup loss in 12 years.\n\n\u201cIt does require a bit of strength, knowing it\u2019s the game we didn\u2019t want to be in.

It\u2019s hard but I\u2019ve known for a couple of years \u2014 the mind is willing but the body is saying \u2018I can\u2019t do this anymore\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster over the last few days but I\u2019ve loved every minute,\u201d added Read.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my last week to be with these men I call good mates. I just want to go out and enjoy the time with those blokes.\u201d\n\nAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen will also move on after Friday\u2019s game after compiling a win record of more than 90 percent over seven years, and Read paid tribute to his boss.\n\n\u201cHe pushed me to better myself as a player,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a world-class operator and is what this team represents.\u201d\n\nRead tipped New Zealand to bounce back from their experience in Japan.\n\n\u201cThe group of men we\u2019ve got are so committed to the All Blacks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey know what it means to be an All Black \u2014 I think we\u2019re in good hands.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 New Zealand legend Kieran Read wants to sign off with a drop goal when he leads out the All Blacks for the last time \u2014 but fears", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/bfea2a_kieran-read-his-body-can-handle-international-rugby-any-all-blacks-giant-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
