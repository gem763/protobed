Yes it is true that the Chinese economy is hurting because of the Trump tariffs, and the Chinese would like to go back to the old way of doing business with one-sided arrangements that put US companies at a disadvantage, and allow rampant Chinese theft of US intellectual property.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the Chinese will cave to US interests as the trade talks resume. In fact, there\u2019s a good reasons to believe that for all the upheaval the trade showdown has caused China (and yes, the US), the chances of the Chinese caving much to US demands remains pretty slim.\n\nEarlier in the week, I was invited to a private dinner hosted by a prominent real estate investors who feted a top Chinese diplomat. The dinner was attended by about 40 people, many of them Wall Street executives who do business overseas including in China. I was the lone reporter in the group, and the ground rules prevent me from disclosing the names of the people who attended and spoke.\n\nThe president can talk all he wants that the Chinese wanting a trade deal; and they may. But they want one that favors THEM.\n\nThe Chinese diplomat was gracious, and fittingly very diplomatic. He gave some remarks, mainly about how our countries have much to gain by cooperating on trade, and how he believes Americans are a great people but they don\u2019t understand the Chinese and the country\u2019s economy, a Communist variant that is unlike what existed under Mao, or the old Soviet Union because it has increasingly adopted free-market policies over the past 30 years or so.\n\nThose policies, he said, have brought rapid change to a country where most people needed government vouchers to purchase staples such as food or soap. China now has a thriving middle class. It has eradicated huge swaths of poverty since this economic transition began. China did this by adopting capitalist economic policies, which included increasingly open markets to US companies, and vice versa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis official isn\u2019t directly involved in the trade talks, but he\u2019s high enough in the government to know the talking points that will be pushed in the coming weeks. So when he opened the floor to questions, I asked one about trade, specifically, \u201cdon\u2019t you need to compromise with the United States on major areas like intellectual property theft, greater access to your markets for US companies, in order to avoid a trade war that will damage both sides?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the diplomat dropped all pretenses of being diplomatic and his answers became more pointed. Again, he said China would prefer NOT to have a trade war with the US but the Chinese believe the American government misunderstands China\u2019s motives in its approach to trade.\n\nThe country is not trying to take over the world economically, he said. Rather, it is 100 percent committed to eradicating poverty in the mainland. His point to me was this: Since the economic reforms began in the early 1980s, China has lifted more than 800 million people out of dire poverty. Today, about 20 million people still face intense destitute conditions.\n\n\"This is much different than poverty in the US,\" he told me. It's more extreme and he said there can be nothing that deters the country from its goal in eliminating poverty.\n\nSo I raised the point: How about a compromise on trade that might stall some of the country's immediate anti-poverty efforts, meaning that there will be some short-term pain for long-term gain. We avert a trade war; long-term, both economies continue to grow and prosper.\n\nHe dismissed that scenario as well; his country, he said, can\u2019t be deterred in its anti-poverty program. And he said one more thing: Threats from the White House will never work. In fact, saber rattling about tariffs, or Trump\u2019s boasts that the Chinese will be forced to make a deal, and those absurd insinuations from the administration that Robert Mueller\u2019s failure to indict the president made the US\u2019s hand on the trade talks stronger, only made the Chinese dig-in more.\n\nThe reason: The Chinese, he said, can never be seen to lose face. The key to any leader\u2019s longevity, even a nominal leader for life like President Xi Jinping, is not showing weakness in the face of Western aggression.\n\nYes many Americans, and this administration in particular, see the Chinese as the aggressors militarily in their sphere of influence and economically. But the Chinese see their tactics not as aggression, but as leveling the playing field following decades of colonialism from the West. There is national pride in China as well, and he referenced the Opium Wars of the 1800s, in which Britain and France, through military action, subdued the Chinese economy, turning China from a net exporter and one of the world\u2019s most vibrant economies, into a backwater.\n\nThat, he said, will never happen again.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe president can talk all he wants that the Chinese wanting a trade deal; and they may. But they want one that favors THEM. And it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re about to compromise on many key issues. In their view, the theft of IP is a means to a necessary end: Growing their economy, and eradicating poverty. US Tariff threats are seen through the prism of western colonialism, not our view of Chinese economic aggression.\n\nIn other words, these aren\u2019t the ideal conditions for a big breakthrough on trade.", "description": "China is more focused on long-term growth than reaching a deal on trade.", "authors": ["Charles Gasparino"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Trumo-Xi-JinPing-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
