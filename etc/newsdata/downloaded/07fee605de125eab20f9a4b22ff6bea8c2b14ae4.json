In a column for the Tacoma News-Tribune, Driscoll says he\u2019s ready for the city to \u201cdo something\u201d to try to make streets safer.\n\nYes, I think the tax on firearms and ammo can potentially do some good, providing a small revenue source to pay for gun-violence prevention programming \u2014 which can\u2019t hurt. Anything helps. But you know what? There\u2019s another part of me that\u2019s just so damn sick and tired of seeing the same tragedies \u2014 and the same lame reactions, defenses and non-responses \u2014 that I\u2019m simply ready for the city to do anything it can. If that essentially amounts to a middle finger directed at the organized gun lobby \u2014 whose sole mission at this point seems to be thwarting any and all common-sense gun regulation \u2014 so be it.\n\nThe proposed tax increase is much more about the middle finger directed at gun owners (not the organized \u201cgun lobby\u201d) than it is about public safety. Driscoll acknowledges that Seattle\u2019s tax on guns and ammo sales, which was passed in 2015, has raised just a small portion of the hundreds of thousands of dollars the tax was supposed to generate, but says that\u2019s okay because a little bit is better than none at all. What Driscoll fails to note is why the tax increase hasn\u2019t led to a bounty of riches taken from gun owners. It\u2019s because most gun stores have left the city and re-opened in the suburbs where the tax increase doesn\u2019t apply. And since Seattle has put its tax in place, violent crime has gone up, not down. If you want to \u201cdo something\u201d, as Driscoll does, shouldn\u2019t you want to do something that works?\n\nDriscoll and the Tacoma city councilman Ryan Mello, who\u2019s introducing the tax increase seem much more interested in poking gun owners than addressing violent crime.\n\nAsked about the reaction he\u2019s received, Mello says, \u201cIt demonstrates to me that the gun lobby has power.\u201d He believes the lobby is \u201cvery concerned that if Tacoma is successful in a firearms and ammunition tax, then it shows the way for other cities, and other cities will do it.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re scared to death, no pun intended, of this concept taking root,\u201d he added.\n\nI think any American, not just gun owners, should be concerned when elected officials decide they\u2019re going to try to make it prohibitively expensive to exercise a constitutionally-protected right. Any increased tax on guns and ammunition will fall disproportionately on those at the lower end of the economic spectrum. Ironically, when Mello was running for city council in 2015, he was all about fighting for the blue-collar wage earners in the city.\n\nMello notes that job creation isn\u2019t the only measure of a healthy economy: \u201cIncome inequality and stagnant wages limit a full recovery. We can\u2019t leave workers behind while others recover.\n\nThat was then and this is now. Just a few years ago it was all about reducing income inequality. Now his goal is to exacerbate it, and to give the middle finger to gun owners in the process.\n\nThe proposed guns and ammo tax will be introduced in the Tacoma City Council next week, and we\u2019ll have more coverage once it\u2019s been formally released.", "description": "A supporter of a proposed tax hike on guns and ammunition says he wants it to pass in order to give \"the middle finger\" to \"the gun lobby\", i.e. gun owners.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/234/59ceb9e8-02b9-40e3-91d6-7bed0b6621cc.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
