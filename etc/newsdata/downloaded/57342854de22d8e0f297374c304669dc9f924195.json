I am as excited to see what he can do as I would be if 'Chessie' were playing. Sbu has been very close to selection as it is.'\n\nOtherwise the Springboks are at full strength with tournament joint-top try-scorer Makazole Mapimpi on the wing, Faf de Klerk at scrum-half, captain Siya Kolisi on the flank and lock pair Lood de Jager and Eben Etzebeth all starting.\n\nKolbe sustained an ankle injury against Japan in quarter-finals and has not recovered fully\n\nSOUTH AFRICA TEAM Willie le Roux (Toyota Verblitz, Japan), Sbu Nkosi (Cell C Sharks), Lukhanyo Am (Cell C Sharks), Damian de Allende (DHL Stormers), Makazole Mapimpi (Cell C Sharks), Handr\u00e9 Pollard (Vodacom Bulls), Faf de Klerk (Sale Sharks, England), Duane Vermeulen (Vodacom Bulls), Pieter-Steph du Toit (DHL Stormers), Siya Kolisi (captain, DHL Stormers), Lood de Jager (Vodacom Bulls), Eben Etzebeth (DHL Stormers), Frans Malherbe (DHL Stormers), Bongi Mbonambi (DHL Stormers), Tendai Mtawarira (Cell C Sharks) REPLACEMENTS: Malcolm Marx (Emirates Lions), Steven Kitshoff (DHL Stormers), Vincent Koch (Saracens, England), RG Snyman (Vodacom Bulls), Franco Mostert (Gloucester, England), Francois Louw (Bath, England), Herschel Jantjies (DHL Stormers), Frans Steyn (Montpellier, France)\n\n'We've been fortunate to have been able to be pretty consistent in selection and we've built some nice momentum,' added Erasmus.\n\n'But the challenge just got a lot tougher on Sunday.\n\n'Wales are the reigning Six Nations champions - as well as Grand Slam winners - and apart from three defeats in their Rugby World Cup warm-ups have put together a really good sequence of results.\n\n'But we've also found some rhythm and we'll be ready for the challenge.\n\n'We have been working hard for 18 months to put ourselves in a position to win the World Cup and that opportunity is now just 80 minutes away\n\n'These players have worked with unbelievable energy to get Springbok rugby back into this position and I know they will leave nothing out on the field on Sunday.\n\n'We can feel the excitement coming from back home in South Africa and how much success will mean to our country.
