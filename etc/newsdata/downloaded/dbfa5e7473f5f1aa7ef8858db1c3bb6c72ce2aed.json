We can make cellphone IEDs in the style of the Afghans. I can teach you that.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Smith did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe FBI was alerted to Smith\u2019s alleged statements on Facebook and used a confidential informant as well as an undercover agent to engage in online discussions with him. Over time, FBI officials said, Smith offered bombmaking formulas to them both.\n\nInvestigators found Smith had talked about joining a far-right Ukrainian paramilitary group in 2016 but ended up joining the U.S. Army a year later.\n\nIn his group conversation, Smith wrote last month that he was looking for more \u201cradicals\u201d like himself and talked about possibly killing far-left protesters known as \u201cantifa,\u201d or possibly destroying cell towers or a local news station, authorities have alleged.\n\nThat same month, he also talked about using a vehicle bomb to attack the headquarters of a major news network, according to the criminal complaint, although authorities did not identify the network in court papers.\n\nOn Friday, Smith and the undercover FBI agent began talking online about types of bombs that could be built from everyday materials, the complaint says. It describes some of those bomb recipes as accurate and others that were not or were accurate only if the right type of ingredients were acquired.\n\nAfter receiving a number of recipes, the undercover agent wrote to Smith: \u201cGot a liberal texas mayor in my sights! Boom with that IED and that dude\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nFBI officials said Smith replied: \u201cThere ya go.\u201d\n\nThe undercover agent asked, \u201cYou got anyone down in Texas that would be a good fit for fire, destruction, and death?\u201d\n\nSmith, according to the complaint, replied: \u201cOutside of Beto? I don\u2019t know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, recently made headlines by saying at a Democratic debate that he would seek to end private ownership of AK-47s and AR-15 rifles. It was unclear whether his proposed mandatory buyback for those weapons triggered Smith\u2019s anger.\n\nTrump says deal on guns \u2018much harder,\u2019 blames O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments\n\nFBI agents arrested Smith on Saturday, and officials say that after his arrest he made several incriminating statements acknowledging he had shared bombmaking recipes with others.\n\nFBI Special Agent Brandon LaMar said in an affidavit that Smith admitted to him \u201cthat he knows how to make improvised explosive devices, and that in online chat rooms he routinely provides instruction on building explosive devices.\u201d\n\nSmith said he did so to cause \u201cchaos,\u201d according to the affidavit. \u201cHe told me that if chaos results in the death of people, even through information he provided, it doesn\u2019t affect him,\u201d LaMar wrote in the affidavit.\n\nThe charge carries a maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison.", "description": "Pfc.
