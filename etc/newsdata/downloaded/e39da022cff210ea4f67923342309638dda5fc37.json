But of course, host Stephen Colbert couldn\u2019t help but get the former secretary of state\u2019s reaction to the latest developments in the Trump whistleblower scandal.\n\nMoments before the Clintons joined Colbert on stage at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York, The Wall Street Journal reported that current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was listening in on President Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian leader that has now prompted a formal impeachment inquiry\u2014despite the fact that he previously pleaded ignorance about the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cHow many times when you were secretary of state did you have to say to Obama, \u2018You can\u2019t extort foreign countries to get dirt on your political enemies?\u2019\u201d Colbert asked, prompting a belly laugh from Clinton.\n\n\u201cYeah, that never happened,\u201d she replied, shaking her head. She added that the secretary of state\u2019s job in that moment is to \u201cmake sure he knows, number one, what the president is going to say on those calls,\u201d implying that the Trump administration may not be as \u201cprepared\u201d for talks with foreign leaders as the previous White House was.\n\nBut \u201cbecause you\u2019ve got a president who doesn\u2019t listen to anybody and doesn\u2019t follow instructions whatsoever,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure they haven\u2019t just given up on trying to give him any sort of preparation.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Clinton pushed back on the \u201cRepublican defenders\u201d of the president who are claiming the charges against him are \u201chearsay.\u201d As she put it, \u201cIt was an admission from the White House! I mean, the transcript of the phone call was put out by the White House. And the whistleblower has a depth of understanding that needs to be taken seriously about what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if the secretary of state was on the call as is now being reported, he should have been one of the very first people to say, \u2018Wait a minute, we\u2019ve got to clean this up. You can\u2019t let that stand,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know what he did.\u201d\n\nAs for Rudy Giuliani, who has been reportedly running what amounts to a shadow State Department on behalf of Trump, Clinton said, \u201cThat would be a big problem\u201d if it had happened under Obama.\n\n\u201cPresidents often use\u2014as do secretaries of state\u2014they might use an envoy or a special adviser to deliver a message,\u201d she said. \u201cBut again, it is supposed to be carefully thought through. And from what we\u2019ve seen on television, carefully thinking through is not one of Rudy\u2019s strong points.\u201d", "description": "The former secretary of state joked that \u201ccarefully thinking through is not one of Rudy\u2019s strong points.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_106/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569891921/115848_0143_hpnbhz", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
