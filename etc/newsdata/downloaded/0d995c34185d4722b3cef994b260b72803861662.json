We\u2019d meet at the private terminal at [Madrid airport] Barajas and [David] Beckham would be off god knows where, [Luis] Figo and [Zinedine] Zidane would be off somewhere or other, Ronaldo and me\u2026and we had to train the day after tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI used to pray for Saturday fixtures so I could go to the Formula 1 on Sunday. It was private jets all over the place. It was crazy.\u201d\n\nThe antics may have been fun for the players, who were a close-knit group, but some managers' attempts to wrest control of the dressing room spelled the end of their time in Madrid.\n\n\u201cDuring the Gal\u00e1cticos era there were seven of us\u2026 it created a dangerous situation in the dressing room.\n\n\u201cWe always managed the situation well, we got along well, but [Jose Antonio] Camacho didn\u2019t and he only lasted 10 days.\n\n\u201cHe came into the dressing room, said hello to everybody and was very serious, a man with a lot of history at Real Madrid.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThen he said: \u2018I want everybody here tomorrow morning at 7am.\u2019 We normally trained at 10:30. We talked to him to try and get him to change the time; we had our habits.\u201d\n\nAnother short-lived appointment was Vanderlei Luxemburgo, and Carlos says he and his pal Ronaldo saw him off after a controversial decision to limit players' access to pre-match beer and wine.\n\n\u201cRonaldo and me told him: \u2018Professor, people here have their habits, you\u2019ll see what they are, but don\u2019t try to change them. Don\u2019t take the wine off the table or stop the beers before dinner or you\u2019ll find yourself with a problem'.\n\n\u201cWhat did he do? First he took away the wine, then he banned the beers. He lasted three months. Football is a small world, the directors heard about it and it was \u201cadios.\u201d\u201d", "description": "The Brazilian World Cup winner has discussed his time as a Galactico at Santiago Bernabeu alongside his old friend", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OHgyxYbYreV4A.LcLixmsg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UUgKmCv1HyOf_Swtd0t2_g--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/712217f78203c0b2d4bb74773d888f7a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
