But Team USA being left off the honors team, or the \u201cAll-Star Five,\u201d entirely is just salt being rubbed in the wound.\n\nNo Americans on the all-World Cup team: Bogdanovic (Serbia), Fournier (France), Rubio (Spain), Gasol (Spain), and Scola (Argentina). Rubio named tournament MVP \u2014 Joe Vardon (@joevardon) September 15, 2019\n\nIndeed, the international players stole the show at the World Cup. In the wake of Spain claiming gold on Sunday, Ricky Rubio and Marc Gasol made the All-World Cup Team along with France\u2019s Evan Fournier, Serbia\u2019s Bogdan Bogdanovic and Argentina\u2019s Luis Scola.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLack of offense for Team USA at FIBA World Cup\n\nThe All-Star Five of the FIBA World Cup tournament did not include any Americans.

Harrison Barnes at 60th (11.6 points per game) rounded out the only three Americans who averaged double digits in the tournament.\n\nDespite head coach Gregg Popovich\u2019s best efforts, there\u2019s no way to sugarcoat just how poorly Team USA performed. Sure, many stars opted against participating and the roster was banged up toward the end, but that all-tournament team would look much different had the Americans played even close to their potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nNothing against the selections; all of them are or were previously serviceable NBA players. They excelled in the international tournament and their respective teams gelled much better than Team USA.\n\nBut this is just another indication of just how far south the FIBA World Cup went for the red, white and blue.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Here is more is salt being rubbed in the wound after a disappointing seventh-place finish.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/W5UjY5rLZNQqXRlSnSSMlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2MZnTutsyExbQadf.cq0Mw--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b32d9ca0-d7c9-11e9-b9fd-815cc496072c", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
