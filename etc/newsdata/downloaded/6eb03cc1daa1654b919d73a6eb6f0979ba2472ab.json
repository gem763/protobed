As she makes her way across the front lawn, the animal sprints toward her, but slows as it turns around tree.\n\nThe young girl runs back toward the driveway as the coyote appears to try to attack but then backs off, the video shows.\n\nThe girl, 5, told WLS-TV in Chicago that the animal touched her and almost bit her chest before she got away.\n\nCoyotes: Coyote attacks on pets on the rise in metro areas, and small dogs are especially vulnerable\n\n'I tried to get it in the eye': Boy, 8, mauled by mountain lion, fought it off with a stick\n\n\"We heard the scream,\" her mother, Elizabeth Przybylski, told the TV station. \"She came in with this wild story.\"\n\nPrzybylski said she and her husband checked the security camera and confirmed their daughter's tale.\n\n\"He really pursued her violently, and I'm so glad she got away,\" Przybylski told WLS-TV. The station reported that the girl had been in the front yard to see if her Halloween costume had arrived in the mail yet.\n\nLocal police said they were in contact with local and state wildlife officials but didn't provide additional details about the incident. USA TODAY has also reached out to the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County and state conservation police for comment.\n\nThe Forest Preserve District of DuPage County says on its website that coyotes are largely not a concern in the area and that the county does not have any documented cases of coyotes biting humans. Villa Park is just over 20 miles west of Chicago.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Illinois girl just avoids coyote attack outside Villa Park home: video", "description": "The incident occurred Tuesday in the\u00a0unincorporated area of Villa Park, Illinois, police said, and the girl got away safely.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
