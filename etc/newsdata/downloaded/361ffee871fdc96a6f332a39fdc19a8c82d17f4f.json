REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain has a robust control system for weapons sales but is reflecting on a ruling that it broke the law in granting licences to export arms to Saudi Arabia, defence Minister Ben Wallace said on Wednesday.\n\nAn English court ruled in June that Britain broke the law by allowing arms sales to Saudi Arabia that might have been deployed in the war in Yemen, after activists said there was evidence the weapons had been used in violation of human rights statutes.\n\nThe British government is appealing the ruling and no new export licences to Saudi Arabia can be granted in the meantime.\n\nAsked by Reuters about the ruling after he gave a speech at the Defence and Security Equipment International arms fair in London, Wallace said the court had noted that Britain already had a robust system in place.\n\n\u201cBritain has one of the most robust export control processes in the world ... with regard to human rights,\u201d Wallace said, hinting that Britain could re-evaluate its policy nevertheless.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously said we\u2019ll appeal it, however we also will reflect on the judgement itself ... We have to have a regard for human rights and we have to demonstrate we are having a regard when we take those decisions on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\nWallace declined to say what the financial impact of the ruling had been on the British defence industry. Although there is a stay on new licences being granted, Britain can continue exporting arms to the kingdom - Britain\u2019s biggest weapons purchaser - under existing licences.", "description": "Britain has a robust control system for weapons sales but is reflecting on a ruling that it broke the law in granting licences to export arms to Saudi Arabia, defence Minister Ben Wallace said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428689288&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A10V", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
