The stock closed up 8% on the day at $31.07.\n\nSlack\u2019s Q3 2020 guidance called for a loss of between $0.08 per share and $0.09 per share. Analysts, however, were looking for expected losses $0.07 per share.\n\nBasically, Slack\u2019s business model involves offering its office collaboration services to smaller businesses for free, while charging large organizations and those looking for increased functionality.\n\nSlack More\n\nIn its S1 filing, the company revealed that as of January 2019, more than 500,000 organizations used the free version of the messaging service.\n\nAs of April, Slack had as many as 95,000 paid customer organizations. In the three months ending in April 2019, 43% of Slack\u2019s revenue came from 645 paid organizations that spent more than $100,000 annually.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, that\u2019s about 1% of Slack\u2019s total customer base. The company is expected to add 75 customers that paid more than $100,000 annually in Q2 2020, versus 61 in the comparable year-ago quarter.\n\nBloomberg project\u2019s Slack\u2019s sales will slow in the near term as it continues to expand in the enterprise space, with the company seeing a 52% increase in fiscal 2020 compared to an 82% in 2019. Sales are expected to continue to slow in 37% in 2021.\n\nSlack has a good deal of competition in the enterprise messaging space. One of its biggest competitors is Microsoft (MSFT), which has a solid chance at cutting off Slack\u2019s business via its Teams enterprise messaging service.\n\nBoth Slack and Teams offer third-party app integration, and can be used either free or via a subscription with enhanced functionality.\n\nLike Lyft and Uber, both of which also filed IPOs this year, Slack has admitted it doesn\u2019t currently make any money \u2014 and there\u2019s the risk that it never will. It all depends on how many enterprise customers the company can convince to spend on its service.\n\nMore from Dan:\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Slack issued its first quarterly earnings report as a public company on Wednesday, beating analysts' estimates on the top and bottom line.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lTkHcwQlUDjdbom1Pztpag--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/68c01cd0-cf43-11e9-9f7d-9698374b4f9e"}
