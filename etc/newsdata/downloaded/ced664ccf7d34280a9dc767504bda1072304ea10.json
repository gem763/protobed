SA Mint finally settles the debate", "language": "en", "text": "South Africans have been debating the past week which side of a coin is the head.\n\nThe South African Mint finally settled the issue, revealing that the coat of arms is the head of the coin.\n\nIt unlocked quite a response on social media.\n\nFor more stories go to the Business Insider South Africa homepage.\n\nThe South African Mint has revealed that the side of the coat of arms is the head of a coin, and the side with the animal is the tail.\n\nTwitter user @Katlego_Moncho first asked her followers which was head or tails of a coin last week Tuesday.\n\nSo, we are having a whole debate in the office about this. ??????Guys, which is heads, and which is tails? pic.twitter.com/sLeIi0rlyW \u2014 IG: Katlego_Moncho (@Katlego_Moncho) October 15, 2019\n\nThis lead to quite a debate on Twitter.\n\nFirst pic - TAILS, Seond pic - HEADS.Don't listen to everyone who says otherwise just because they base it on the front and back faces of a coin. \u2014 Damien Sebe ???? (@DamienSebe) October 15, 2019\n\nFirst pic tails 2nd pic heads \u2014 Taboka Tabz (@TabokaS) October 15, 2019\n\nAnimal in front always has a tail. The other side has the \"logo\" for the state - hence it's heads \u2014 Nayomi Kambel (@Qamatas_finest) October 15, 2019\n\nWow! First is heads. I believe that it is derived from most coins having former heads of states in the first frame. \u2014 Mamnguni (@Mnqwazam) October 16, 2019\n\nThe head is frame 2 and tails frame 1 .Back in the day the coin would have a monarch's head like the queen ,due to democracy it has been substituted with the country's court of arms, hence all coins have the same \"head\" and different tails. \u2014 R E L E N T L E S S ?? (@Chimusoro2) October 16, 2019\n\nThe old SA coins used to have heads on one side, hence that was referred to as the head and the other side the tail. Now the heads have been replaced by the coat of arms. Kakhle kakhle that side is the obverse side and the side with the coin value is the reverse.

I've always known the 1st pic to be heads, the 2nd tails pic.twitter.com/ojdNB4TdTy \u2014 Siyabonga Nonoise\u00ae (@CeeYaNonoise) October 16, 2019\n\nHoly shit,I came to the comments section knowing whats what...now im not so sure. I was like \"how is this even a debate\" \u2014 Mr Black (@BlackHighBrow) October 15, 2019\n\nResponding to the tweet days later, the South African Mint (@SAMint) said heads is the official stateside of a coin.\n\nIn South Africa\u2019s case it is the coat of arms, and the animal side the tails, the Mint said.\n\nHi @Katlego_Moncho, thank you for your tweet. The heads are the official state side. Which in this case is the coats of arms. Tails is the animal side. Kind regards, The South African Mint. \u2014 SouthAfricanMint (@SAMint) October 17, 2019\n\nThe response was met with frustration from twitter users who claimed that the South African Mint was spreading fake news.\n\nI\u2019m not happy with this explanation. The Animal side just seems like the front of the coin and the coat of arms seems like the back.

The first silver coin was announced last November.\n\n(Compiled by James de Villiers)", "description": "South Africans have been debating which side of a coin is the head over the past week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9497/b76081ba90ac48e5b2b02f586a593ab4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
