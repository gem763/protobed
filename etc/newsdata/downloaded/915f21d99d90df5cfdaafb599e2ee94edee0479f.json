It says the government should review systems where customers can reuse and refill containers to see what works and where official intervention could encourage retailers to offer refillable options.\n\nThe government has unveiled plans to improve recycling rates, with a greater responsibility on producers to pay for the costs of dealing with packaging, a deposit return scheme on drinks containers and more consistency in local council recycling collections.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

However, replacing plastic with other materials isn\u2019t always the best solution, as all materials have an environmental impact.\n\n\u201cMy committee is also concerned that compostable plastics have been introduced without the right infrastructure or consumer understanding about how to dispose of them. Fundamentally, substitution is not the answer, and we need to look at ways to cut down on single-use packaging.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Ensuring that all local authorities collect the same plastics for recycling will make it easier for packaging to be labelled, so consumers know whether that packaging is recyclable or not.\u201d\n\nThe growth in single-use consumer plastics has fuelled a surge in plastic pollution around the world. It is estimated there are now 5.25 trillion pieces of ocean plastic debris, and a recent report estimated the quantity of plastic in the sea will treble by 2025.\n\nAround 40 per cent of plastics are thought to enter the waste stream in the same year they are produced.\n\nLouise Edge, head of Greenpeace UK\u2019s ocean plastics campaign, told The Independent: \u201cPlastic is harmful to wildlife and remains in our oceans for hundreds of years.\n\n\u201cBut when companies switch from plastic to paper packaging, this amounts to chopping down trees to save the oceans, and all too often so-called compostable alternatives don\u2019t actually break down as they should. These are false solutions.\n\n\u201cShifting away from all single-use packaging is definitely the right move. The government must act on the recommendation to review reusable and refillable packaging models, and must set clear plastic reduction targets in the upcoming environment bill.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "MPs have called for a tax on all single-use plastic packaging\u00a0and also raised concerns that compostable plastics are being introduced without consumers knowing how to dispose of them. \u00a0 The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee says a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d away from all single-use packaging is needed to help the environment.
