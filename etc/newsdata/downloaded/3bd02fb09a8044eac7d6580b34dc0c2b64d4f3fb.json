REUTERS/Lisi Niesner/File Photo\n\nWorld record holder Kipchoge smashed the two-hour barrier on a special course in Vienna on Saturday, finishing in one hour 59 minutes and 40 seconds in an unofficial attempt.\n\nBefore switching focus to his next challenge, which could include another Olympic appearance, the 34-year-old plans to recharge his batteries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take three weeks of active rest and then I\u2019ll know what next. I\u2019m taking normal meals with a lot of carbohydrates,\u201d he said in a question and answer session on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concentrating purely on recovery and I have not given any thought for any other challenge. It\u2019s too early to tell (about the Olympics).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never said that I\u2019ll no longer run (a marathon) but I\u2019m going to first recover and then decide which race to run.\u201d\n\nThe sub-two hour marathon is widely regarded as the biggest achievement in athletics since Briton Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile in 1954 - and was compared by Kipchoge himself to landing on the moon.\n\nKipchoge believes his run, which was organized and funded by the British chemical company INEOS and dubbed the INEOS 1.59 challenge, will encourage the next generation of athletes to push the boundaries in his home country.\n\nThe winning moment sparked jubilant scenes in Kenya as traffic was brought to a halt in Nairobi by hundreds of fans celebrating in front of a giant screen.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot... I received a lot of messages. I saw people celebrating all over the country,\u201d Kipchoge said.\n\n\u201cKenya will not be the same. It will be united and in future Kenya will be a running nation.\u201d", "description": "Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge said he needs time to recover physically and mentally after becoming the first person to run a marathon in under two hours and has yet to decide if he will defend his title at next year's Tokyo Olympics.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440448662&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0L3-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
