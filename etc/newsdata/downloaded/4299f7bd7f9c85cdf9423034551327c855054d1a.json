Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whom Trump and Giuliani vehemently criticized. Current and former officials told Congress that they believed Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster was politically motivated.\n\nMcKinley, according to people familiar with his nearly five-hour closed-door testimony, said he resigned in part after learning that Trump blasted Yovanovitch during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. McKinley also said the State Department was not doing enough to shield officials like Yovanovitch from partisan-driven criticisms and pressure.\n\nMcKinley\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nYovanovitch, who is still employed by the State Department, told congressional investigators last week that there was a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d to smear her based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d She also said she believed that she was forced out at Trump\u2019s direction. The dynamic that led to her ouster, she said, was causing \u201cthis nation\u2019s most loyal and talented public servants\u201d to run for the exits.\n\nMcKinley served as ambassador to four countries and has had several postings at U.S. embassies all over the world. He first joined the Foreign Service in 1982 and is highly respected among the diplomatic corps.\n\nA former colleague told POLITICO that McKinley did not work directly on Ukraine-related issues but was concerned that standard diplomatic protocols were being sidelined in favor of a Giuliani-led campaign to discredit top U.S. officials who were unwilling to pursue politically motivated investigations of the president\u2019s political opponents.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bc/d7/2901926f4c0799b062ed34c98d34/191016-michael-mckinley-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
