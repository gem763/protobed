(AP) - Brown County tourism officials have switched on their seasonal \u201cleaf cam\u201d that monitors the forested region\u2019s changing fall foliage.\n\nThe camera that\u2019s perched atop a cabin near the southern Indiana county\u2019s Bean Blossom overlook shows a panoramic view of the scenery nearby, and refreshes every 15 minutes.\n\nThe forested view of the county that\u2019s a popular tourist destination currently shows largely green leaves. But the foliage will be filling up with autumnal reds, yellows, oranges and browns in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Herald-Times reports that the Brown County Convention and Visitors Bureau says that between late September and early November the county\u2019s trees will put on a showy display with an array of colors.\n\nMid-October is usually the peak season for those colors. Weather can affect its arrival time.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Herald Times, http://www.heraldtimesonline.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brown County tourism officials have switched on their seasonal \"leaf cam\" that monitors the forested region's changing fall foliage.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
