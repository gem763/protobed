Trump\u2019s rhetoric about ending stupid and wasteful wars in the Middle East is not matched by the reality of policy. Trump expanded the already expanding use of drone warfare under Obama. He loosened rules of military engagement, meaning that the U.S. pace of killing people in unauthorized and unpopular conflicts has gone up under Trump. Under Trump, the rate of bombing in Afghanistan is dramatically increasing, as we pass into the 18th year of war in that country. Trump ditched the Iran deal and has given a green light to Saudi Arabia to continue its belligerent policy across the region.\n\nIn fact, the only consistent thing about his foreign policy is that Trump seems to think he\u2019s being clever and currying favors by turning a blind eye to human-rights abuses or encouraging a foreign government to do something disgraceful. These governments tend to pocket U.S. concessions and give nothing in return. Trump flatters Kim Jong-un, but the Korean Peninsula has not denuclearized. Trump tells Chairman Xi that while the two countries conduct their trade war, he will not criticize the Chinese government for its human-rights abuses. Meanwhile, China spreads conspiracy theories that the Hong Kongers are a cat\u2019s-paw for American subterfuge. Trump signals to Erdogan\u2019s Turkey that he is fine with a major incursion into Syria. But what is the U.S. getting out of this foreign policy?", "description": "", "authors": ["M.B.
