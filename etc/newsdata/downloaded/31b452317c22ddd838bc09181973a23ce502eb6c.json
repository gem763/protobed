Sessions is exploring the possibility of a run for his former Senate seat in Alabama.\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is exploring the possibility of a run for his former Senate seat in Alabama, according to people with knowledge of the calls.\n\nThree Republicans with knowledge of the situation say Sessions has made telephone calls exploring the possibility of running for his old Senate seat. The Republicans spoke on condition of anonymity so they could speak more freely about closely held conversations.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how close Sessions was to making a decision or the seriousness of the exploration.\n\nSessions has until next Friday to decide whether to be a last-minute entry into the 2020 Senate race. The Alabama Republican Party closes qualifying for 2020 candidates at 5 p.m. Nov. 8.\n\nSen. Doug Jones, a Democrat, won the 2017 special election to fill Sessions\u2019 seat by defeating Republican Roy Moore.\n\nRepublicans see recapturing the Senate seat in the once reliably red state as a top priority in 2020.\n\nA crowded GOP primary field is already competing for the Republican nomination and the right to challenge Jones. Sessions\u2019 entry into the race would upend the already competitive primary that includes U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, Moore and others.\n\nSessions was one the first national Republicans to line up behind Donald Trump\u2019s fledgling 2016 campaign. He left his Senate seat to become President Trump\u2019s first attorney general. He was ousted after enduring public mocking from Trump for recusing himself from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nOne unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s repeated criticism would affect a Sessions campaign.\n\nSessions reiterated his support for Trump in a speech earlier this month at a state party fundraiser.\n\n\u201cHe is relentlessly and actually honoring the promises he made to the American people,\u201d Sessions said in the speech at Huntsville.\n\nSessions did not mention the Senate race but criticized Democrats as the party that sees \u201cmore government\u201d as the answer.\n\nHe said he believes Republicans could achieve historic congressional majorities in 2020, but cautioned that they must show they are responding to the concerns of average Americans.", "description": "According to AP sources, the former attorney general has made telephone calls exploring the possibility of running for his old Senate seat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db78cb8210000423534b4d8.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
