That crisis has nothing to do, however, with the cases currently on the court\u2019s docket.\n\nThe court\u2019s term presents, ironically enough, as a constitutional sideshow to the impeachment-related activity under way in the House and the investigation of the U.S. intelligence community being conducted by the executive branch itself, with the sought-after assistance of foreign governments. No doubt those inter-branch and inter-party disputes eventually will be confided to the court for resolution, the hope being that the justices will overcome their partisan backgrounds and emerge as the \u201cadults in the room.\u201d\n\nBut this inter-branch and inter-party animus \u2014 and the refereeing sure to be conducted by the court \u2014 are but symptoms of the greater crisis of our constitutional order: our vast public ignorance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSurveys have borne out that many, if not most, Americans have no idea how our government is structured, how it supposed to work, and what it requires of us as citizens.\n\nPolling conducted by the Annenberg Foundation and Xavier University has revealed, for example, that nearly half of adult Americans cannot pass the basic test \u2014 the test passed by more than 90 percent of immigrants \u2014 given to aspiring citizens. Worse, American citizens seem to demonstrate their greatest ignorance about the basics of the American political system. Eighty-five percent have no idea what the \u201crule of law\u201d is. Well OK, you might say, that concept seems to confuse even our president.\n\nBut it gets worse. Some two-thirds do not know there are three branches of government. And 71 percent of American adult citizens do not know that our Constitution is the source of supreme law in the United States.\n\nThe dire implications of this vast public ignorance are embedded in the very structure of our Constitution. The document created by the Founders, and ratified with 10 amendments known as the Bill of Rights, is shot through with compromise. The interests of smaller states were protected by creating a Senate where states held equal voting power regardless of size. The interests of popular sovereignty were protected by creating a House of Representatives apportioned according to population.\n\nThe need for an executive was satisfied by creating a President of the United States, who was vested with the power to serve as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, to negotiate treaties and appoint ambassadors to foreign nations, and otherwise run the government, enforcing the laws that Congress passed and he or she signed and did not veto.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nConcerns about the scope of presidential power were addressed by allowing Congress to override a presidential veto and by reposing in Congress, rather than the president, the power to declare war, by providing for Senate ratification of treaties and by providing for senatorial \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on critical presidential appointees.\n\nHere\u2019s the point: Such a structure requires accommodation of opposing views or it will collapse; compromise is its DNA.\n\nIf the method was compromise, the underlying principle was a healthy distrust of concentrated power. Politics attracts many good people; it also, however, attracts creatures of unbounded appetites, who never will be satisfied with the power they have at any given moment. They will lust for more and, therefore, the Founders concluded, they must be stopped. Accordingly, the U.S. Constitution is designed above all to frustrate the untrammeled exercise of power.\n\nBut that\u2019s the truly alarming part of our current climate of ignorance. If some 70 percent of American citizens don\u2019t know there are three branches of government, it\u2019s a sure bet they can\u2019t tell us why power was so divided. If they can\u2019t identify the Constitution as our supreme law, what hope is there that they will understand the mistrust of concentrated power that underlies its structure, or the necessity for dialogue and compromise inherent in our system\u2019s very design?\n\nAbsent that understanding, our system of checks and balances has come to many to seem self-defeating, and the emergence of an apparent \u201cstrongman\u201d is becoming dangerously alluring.\n\nThe mere existence of rival political parties has come to seem illegitimate; hence, the repeated crises of legitimacy since the end of the Cold War, from the impeachment of Bill Clinton to Bush v. Gore, from the \u201cbirther\u201d movement to repeated government shutdowns to the current climate of partisan and inter-branch stalemate.\n\nMost disturbing, absent that basic understanding of the necessity for accommodation of opposing views, compromise has died in our culture as a virtue. Our freedoms have become unmoored from any sense of civic responsibility and indistinguishable, therefore, from our appetites. Consider this:\n\nOur resistance to restraints on our economic appetites nearly caused the world economy to collapse \u2014 twice.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur resistance to any limits on the right to carry firearms has flooded our country with 300 million weapons; mass shootings have become appallingly routine.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur resistance to any limits on speech has led to the normalization of pornography, with its exploitation of women and children.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur equation of spending with speech has led to a political arena in which a rich person\u2019s or corporation\u2019s \u201cspeech\u201d is necessarily valued more highly than an average or poor person\u2019s speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nCable news and social media have become engines of extremism, a wasteland in which the pressure always to have something to say \u2014 and to say something extreme enough to drive up audience share and, with it, profits \u2014 acts as an accelerant to any public argument, driving people further apart.\n\nIn short, as a society we have become not fulfilled but deformed by the excesses of our appetites.\n\nSeen in this light, President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Trump directed Perry, State Dept. officials to talk to Giuliani on Ukraine: report Murkowski warns against rushing to conclusions on Trump impeachment MORE is the walking, talking, tweeting proof that, ultimately, our politics cannot be separated from a culture grounded in ignorance of our basic values, a culture that has substituted unrestrained appetites for ordered liberty.\n\nAs the court begins its term this week, we should pause and remind ourselves that the survival of our form of government is not written in the stars, or even in the Constitution. It is embedded, or it should be, in our culture, in a shared understanding of what it means to be an American. But it is precisely this wisdom of the Framers \u2014 that because republics are fragile, compromise is essential \u2014 whose disappearance from our culture and politics is reflected so starkly in the survey numbers and in post-Cold War American culture.\n\nBeyond the noise of our moment, that \u2014 our collective ignorance \u2014 is our greatest constitutional crisis.\n\nJohn Farmer Jr. is director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.
