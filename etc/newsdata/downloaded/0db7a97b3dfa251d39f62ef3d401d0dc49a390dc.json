But as a taxpayer petition filed in state court powerfully argues, this taxpayer subsidy violates a Texas statute, dating back to the 19th century, that imposes criminal liability on anyone who \u201cfurnishes the means for procuring an abortion knowing the purpose intended.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat statute, the petition acknowledges, is unenforceable under Roe v. Wade and successor cases insofar as it would penalize actions that have been held to be constitutionally protected under the Roe regime. But \u201c[i]t has long been established that women seeking to abort their pregnancies have no constitutional right to taxpayer assistance, and that the withholding of taxpayer subsidies does not constitute an \u2018undue burden.\u2019\u201d Therefore, the statute remains enforceable against Austin\u2019s expenditures of taxpayer money for abortion.\n\nThe Texas statute was part of the set of Texas abortion laws that were at issue in Roe v. Wade and that the Supreme Court held to be unconstitutional in many of their applications. But as the petition explains, \u201cA Supreme Court ruling that declares a statute unconstitutional means only that the statute may not be enforced in a manner that contradicts the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Constitution.\u201d In particular, contrary to common references to a court\u2019s \u201cstriking down\u201d a statute, the federal courts \u201cdo not wield a writ of erasure over the statutes that they declare unconstitutional, and these statutes continue to exist as laws until they are repealed by the legislature that enacted them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVery alert longtime readers might recognize that the mistaken notion that judges \u201cstrike down\u201d laws is part of the myth of judicial supremacy that I\u2019ve been combating over the years. (See, e.g., this book review of mine.) One excellent law-review article that I\u2019ve had occasion to cite is Jonathan Mitchell\u2019s \u201cThe Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy.\u201d Not coincidentally, Mitchell represents the taxpayer petitioner in the lawsuit against Austin.", "description": "The city of Austin, Texas, recently enacted a budget that provides $150,000 in taxpayer money to organizations that provide travel, lodging, and other forms of aid to women seeking abortion.
