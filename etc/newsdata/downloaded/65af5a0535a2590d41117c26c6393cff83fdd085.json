REUTERS/David Gray\n\nIn early European trades, futures for the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 were up 0.1% while those for Germany\u2019s DAX added 0.25%. London\u2019s FTSE futures were mostly flat as were U.S. stock futures.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.3% with Japan\u2019s Nikkei finishing up 0.55% after hitting a one-year high. Australian shares climbed 0.3%.\n\nRisk appetite was also aided after U.S. President Donald Trump lifted sanctions on Turkey saying a ceasefire in northern Syria was now permanent.\n\n\u201cU.S.-China trade friction seems to be entering a truce, a no-deal Brexit looks increasingly likely to be avoided, and the U.S.\u2019s posture against Turkey appears to have been softening,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Tohru Sasaki wrote in a note pointing to reasons for a rally in Nikkei.\n\nJPMorgan expects gains in the Japanese index to extend into year-end led by share buy-backs.\n\nA private survey showed Japanese factory activity shrank at the fastest pace in over three years in October, hurt by slowing global demand and trade frictions.\n\nChinese shares did open higher but soon erased those gains with the blue-chip index easing 0.3%.\n\nOn Wall Street overnight, the Dow and the Nasdaq added 0.2% each while the S&P 500 gained 0.3%.\n\nTesla shares jumped 21% in after-hours trading following a surprise third quarter profit.\n\nMicrosoft also posted forecast-beating profit and revenue numbers after the closing bell though the outlook was darkened by slower-than-expected take-up of its Azure cloud services.\n\nEarlier, shares of U.S. industrial bellwethers Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc ended about 1% higher each despite big earnings misses.\n\nRBC Capital Markets\u2019 chief economist Tom Porcelli pointed to consistently alarming headlines since the first quarter of 2018 suggesting poor Caterpillar earnings meant a recession was round the corner, though that has yet to transpire.\n\n\u201cWe have been down this road before with CAT,\u201d Porcelli said in a note titled \u2018Still Waiting For Recession.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf you keep saying a recession is here, it is a mathematical certainty that at some point you will be right,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMaybe try again after CAT\u2019s next quarterly earnings report.\u201d\n\nSo far, results from about 125 of the S&P500 companies are out with analysts expecting earnings to have declined 2.9% year-over-year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nBREXIT BATTLE\n\nCurrency markets stuck to tight ranges ahead of key central bank meetings this week and next with the euro zone, Japan and United States due to review policy. European and U.S. manufacturing numbers are due later in the day.\n\nSterling paused at $1.2914 after rising 0.3% on Wednesday with Brexit developments in focus.\n\nBritain appears closer than ever to resolving its 3-1/2-year Brexit conundrum but there are still hurdles to clear.\n\nEU member states on Wednesday delayed a decision on whether to grant Britain a three-month Brexit extension. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said if the deadline is deferred to the end of January, he would call an election.\n\n\u201cThe Brexit battle looks like it will drag on,\u201d economists at ANZ wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cThe UK government will not meet its current timetable of leaving the EU on 31 October, and an extension appears likely. In the meantime, Brexit uncertainty will keep weighing on UK business investment and activity.\u201d\n\nThe single currency was flat at $1.1132. The Japanese yen was 0.1% higher at 108.6 per dollar while the Australian dollar was a tad weaker at $0.6842.\n\nThat left the dollar index slightly lower at 97.452 against a basket of six major currencies.\n\nIn commodity markets, U.S. crude eased 38 cents to $55.59 while Brent slipped 22 cents to $60.95.\n\nGold was treading water at $1,491.51 an ounce.", "description": "Asian shares pulled ahead on Thursday as corporate earnings and a ceasefire in northern Syria helped prop up sentiment, though the backdrop of trade and brexit uncertainties was enough to prevent a decisive shift towards riskier assets.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444343416&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N06M", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
