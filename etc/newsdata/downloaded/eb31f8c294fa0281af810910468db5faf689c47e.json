I know Ohio State\u2019s system was like counting to 10, whereas the NFL is akin to calculus. I know he\u2019s essentially two seasons removed from prep football at Bullis School.\n\nBut, still, it\u2019s hard to believe Haskins is so far behind the curve that Callahan can\u2019t possibly put him on the field. Even Nathan Peterman, awful as he was with the Buffalo Bills, appeared in eight games and made four starts. And despite throwing three touchdowns against 12 interceptions, he showed enough to somehow join the Oakland Raiders.\n\nHaskins\u2018 career got off to a Petermanian start (no touchdowns, three interceptions and two sacks) when he debuted against the New York Giants in a Week 4 relief appearance. The outing confirmed Gruden\u2019s contention that Haskins wasn\u2019t ready. It was plain for everyone to see.\n\nHowever, with Washington 0-5 and going nowhere except the top of the 2020 draft, the organization needs to reconsider its definition of \u201cready\u201d regarding Haskins. Specifically, what exactly isn\u2019t he ready for?\n\nI\u2019ll start.\n\nHe\u2019s not ready to offer Washington its best chance of winning any given game. He\u2019s not ready to display expertise in dissecting opposing defenses. He\u2019s not ready to play at a level that consistently lifts his teammates\u2019 performances.\n\nLet\u2019s say there\u2019s unanimous agreement on those standards. Great. That\u2019s still not reason enough to keep him on the bench until next year or (perish the thought) 2021.\n\nThe only cause worthy of consideration is his ability to avoid being pulverized on every other dropback.\n\nQuarterbacks who hold the ball too long and routinely look in the wrong direction are hazardous to their health. Rusty veteran Colt McCoy took six sacks on 27 attempts last week, primarily working the quick, short passing game. Against a newbie like Haskins, New England might\u2019ve threatened the NFL record for sacks (12).\n\nBut that\u2019s where coaching comes in assuming it\u2019s any good and the prospect has any talent.\n\nBabies shouldn\u2019t start out eating steak and rookie QBs shouldn\u2019t start out digesting voluminous playbooks. Infants needn\u2019t begin by speaking whole sentences; new QBs needn\u2019t begin by uttering calls like \u201czebra trojan, far west right slot, X-short, 200 jet smoke, X-choice.\u201d\n\nYes, that\u2019s an actual call from another notoriously verbose Gruden, Raiders coach/Jay\u2019s older brother Jon.\n\nHere\u2019s what Haskins SHOULD be ready for, and what Callahan and offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell should supply: an offense tailored to highlight Haskins\u2018 strengths and mask his weaknesses; a package of plays that he can perfect in practice and execute with confidence in games; streamlined verbiage to help him in the huddle and simple cues to help him at the line.\n\n(That being said, observers who criticized Gruden for playing Haskins against the Giants are ridiculous. Haskins was the backup, and backups are always a snap away from entering the game. He\u2019s either ready to be No. 2 or he\u2019s listed as inactive. Being active and not ready makes no sense.)\n\nThankfully, Callahan intends to provide Haskins with the practice repetitions that Gruden didn\u2019t offer. While the interim coach is at it, he should make the aforementioned tweaks, too. When his attempts to be more ground-oriented fail \u2014 or when Washington falls desperately behind and has to abandon the run \u2014 whoever\u2019s under center will need to air it out.\n\nStarting Haskins this week against Miami seemingly would\u2019ve been a good launch point, but, OK, let\u2019s give the new regime a little time to work with the change in philosophy. Let\u2019s say Haskins doesn\u2019t start in Week 7 against San Francisco, or the next two weeks, either, against Minnesota and Buffalo. Fine.\n\nWashington\u2019s bye comes in Week 10. It\u2019s followed by a home game against the New York Jets on Nov. 17. The team easily could be 0-9 or 1-8 by that point.\n\nIf Haskins isn\u2019t inserted into the starting lineup \u2014 for good \u2014 by Week 11, Washington might as well draft another first-round QB next year.\n\n\u2022 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
