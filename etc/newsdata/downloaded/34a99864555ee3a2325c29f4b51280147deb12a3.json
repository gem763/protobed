Behind the camera the person expresses disbelief saying: \u201cBelieve it or not, this is daytime mum, just 10 minutes before 1pm.\u201d\n\nIndonesia forest fires spark blame game as smoke closes hundreds of Malaysia schools Read more\n\nThe footage was taken in a village in Jambi, Sumatra by primary school teacher Ayu Putri Wijianti, who wanted to share the unusual scene with family and friends on WhatsApp. She started filming on Saturday after she saw the sky turn from yellow to red.\n\n\u201cI was very surprised because the sky went red. It was dark, and the wind was blowing strong. The feeling was that it was another world,\u201d Ayu told the Guardian on Tuesday.\n\nAyu said the video was not edited and the footage taken was \u201cwhat it looked like naturally\u201d. In recent days the sky has been yellow in Jambi, but the conditions on Saturday\u2019s gave the sky its copper-red glow, she said.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s meteorology, climatology and geophysics agency (BMKG) has explained the Mars-like skies over Jambi as a phenomenon known as \u201cMie Scattering.\u201d\n\nThe red colour is apparently caused by the sunlight being scattered in the air by 0.7-micrometer particles. The BMKG said the pervasive red is produced when the micro-particles of pollutants in the air are equal to the wavelength of visible sunlight.\n\nForest fires are an annual occurrence in Indonesia, a result of slash and burn techniques used to quickly and cheaply clear land for mostly oil palm plantations, but this year, due to a protracted drought, they are more severe.\n\nThe crisis has pushed air pollution indexes off the charts in Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo, forced the cancellation of scores of flights, the closure of hundreds of schools across Indonesia and Malaysia, caused diplomatic tensions, and made hundreds of thousands of people sick.\n\nOn Monday, Indonesia\u2019s disaster mitigation agency said that almost one million people were suffering from acute respiratory infections caused by the haze and forest fires.\n\n", "description": "Surreal footage shows Jambi swamped in thick cloud of pollution", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385127cd88da56ee7c56196375a1669f52cf341c/48_3_1773_1064/master/1773.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=41a7d59efa24a9a0dfc20b87304a5d2c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
