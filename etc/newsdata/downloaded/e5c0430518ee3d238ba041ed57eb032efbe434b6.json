It is currently exempt from the output cuts agreed by OPEC and a group of non-OPEC producers.\n\nTensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia has long been tensed because of the rival religious powers' power struggle (often by proxy) in the region.\n\n\"Despite this long-term up and down political relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia we have been friends and I hope to be friends in future, we have no difficulty with him,\" he said, adding that the difficulty in Saudi-Iranian relations was not created from the Iranian side.\n\n\"We believe that all the Muslim countries, all the neighbor countries, should have a peaceful environment between themselves \u2026 Our enemy is another country out of this area,\" he said, making a thinly veiled swipe at the U.S.\n\nThat said, tensions are high between the countries following a missile and drone attack on two Saudi Arabian oil facilities in September. Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack but Saudi Arabia and the U.S. suggested that the Houthi's ally Iran had a role in, or was responsible for, the attack on Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq and Khurais oil facility. The attack initially halved Saudi Arabia's oil production. Iran denied the accusations that it was involved, calling them \"meaningless\" and \"pointless.\"\n\nAsked about the attack's effect on Iran, Zanganeh said \"it has no effect on Iran's production and export, but these issues increase the tension in the region.\"\n\nHe said all of the countries around the Persian Gulf \"should try to stabilize the region and to defend the peace for all in the Persian Gulf region and to secure the Hormuz Strait for the free transport of oil and other commodity transportation to the international market.\"\n\nIncreased pressure in the form of U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil and other industries did not work, Zanganeh said.\n\n\"We believe that all of the countries around the world believe that unilateralism doesn't work and their increase of the pressure on Iran cannot be the solution for a stable situation and a peaceful environment in the region and for the world and for the security of supply of oil, gas and LNG.\"\n\nOil prices slipped on Tuesday following weak U.S. manufacturing activity data that put downward pressure on crude's demand outlook. On Wednesday, benchmark Brent crude was trading at $58.69 whereas West Texas Intermediate was trading at $53.75.", "description": "Geopolitical tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia are high but Iran's oil minister insisted he has a good rapport with his Saudi counterpart.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106159785-1570007103785gettyimages-1153124050.jpeg?v=1570007126"}
