Regardless of gender, sexuality or fame, it\u2019s just not okay. Just because you had a poster of the Jonas Brothers on your bedroom wall as a teen doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to touch them, especially during a performance. Just don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it to Nick Jonas, don\u2019t do it to your favourite local band. Just don\u2019t do it.\n\nIn footage captured by another fan at the LA show, Nick can be seen standing on a small ledge of the stage, where he was unfortunately groped from behind by a fan who repeatedly rubbed his leg and tried to grab his ass.\n\nWTF???????? this is very disrespectful!! pic.twitter.com/he2KGmm2qS \u2014 Nick Jonas FAN ???????? (@NickJDaily) October 22, 2019\n\nThe incident took place on October 21, during their second sold-out performance at the Hollywood Bowl in California.\n\nOther fans and a security guard repeatedly tried to stop the punter\u2019s wildly inappropriate actions, but they had no luck. Nick eventually had to physically remove her hand from his body before turning around and (presumably) exchanging words or a \u201chey, don\u2019t touch me\u201d look.\n\nThroughout the video, it\u2019s abundantly clear that the youngest of the famous Jonas Brothers was uncomfortable and that the contact was nonconsensual.\n\nThe incident comes almost exactly two years after fellow teen-heartthrob Harry Styles suffered a similar ordeal at the same venue during the We Can Survive breast cancer benefit concert.\n\nThankfully, an overwhelming majority of fans were quick to condemn the actions on social media. In a matter of days, the post has received 280 retweets and 1100 likes, as well as a slew of angry responses from fans that were frankly appalled by the punter\u2019s actions.\n\nFeels like some people forget about consent when it\u2019s not them who are getting touched by random people ???????? \u2014 Sofia ???? (@sofsilva96) October 23, 2019\n\nThe Jonas Brothers are yet to make a statement about the incident, but Nick has taken to Twitter to thank fans for supporting them at the show.\n\nHollywood Bowl night 2. Thank you to every single one of you who made these two sold out nights so incredible. I am so grateful. pic.twitter.com/AJIcYGUsKS \u2014 Nick Jonas (@nickjonas) October 23, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s 2019. Consent matters. If you really respect an artist, respect their boundaries too.", "description": "Footage has surfaced of Nick Jonas being sexually harrassed by a fan during a Jonas Brothers concert at the Hollywood Bowl in LA.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182066251.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
