I expect your explanation immediately regarding the content of this document and Boeing's delay in disclosing the document to its safety regulator.\"\n\nThe FAA said it flagged its concerns to lawmakers on Capitol Hill and the Department of Transportation's inspector general.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson said Muilenburg called Dickson to respond to \"the concerns raised in his letter\" and to assure the agency that the company is \"taking every step possible to safely return the MAX to service\".\n\n'Deeply troubling'\n\nBoeing furnished the messages earlier in the year to \"the appropriate investigating authority\", the company's spokesperson said.\n\n\"Boeing has also been voluntarily co-operating with the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee's investigation into the 737 MAX. As part of that cooperation, today we brought that document to the Committee's attention as well. We will continue to co-operate with the Committee, and all other authorities, as they move forward with their investigations.\"\n\nMaria Cantwell, the senior Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, said regulators \"must receive full co-operation and all relevant documents so a full and thorough investigation can take place,\" adding that the reports about the messages and the lack of timely disclosure are \"deeply troubling\".\n\nNews of the messages comes as the FAA has taken the lead among international regulators in overseeing the recertification of the MAX in a process that has dragged on much longer than originally expected.\n\nThe messages add to the pressure on Muilenburg ahead of an October 30 congressional hearing. Boeing last week stripped Muilenburg of his title as chair, a move that analysts said could be a precursor to his removal as chief executive.", "description": "A Boeing pilot behind the 737 MAX certification in 2016 told a colleague a key flight handling system was \"running rampant\" during simulator tests, according to documents reviewed Friday by AFP.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5499/a2d2ab0423354c48a6d0a163e2fd52e4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
