Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nWith Skyworth Group yielding 4.1% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 4.0% of market capitalisation this year. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Skyworth Group for its dividend, and we'll go through these below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Skyworth Group!\n\nSEHK:751 Historical Dividend Yield, September 4th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 38% of Skyworth Group's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Last year, Skyworth Group paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.\n\nIs Skyworth Group's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Skyworth Group has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. Skyworth Group has net debt of 4.54 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the limit of most investors' comfort zones. Judicious use of debt can enhance shareholder returns, but also adds to the risk if something goes awry.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Skyworth Group has EBIT of 10.76 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Skyworth Group's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Skyworth Group's dividend payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was CN\u00a50.07 in 2009, compared to CN\u00a50.068 last year. Dividend payments have shrunk at a rate of less than 1% per annum over this time frame.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Skyworth Group Limited (HKG:751) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
