It\u2019s a love story that continues.\n\n\u201cMichael was born after an eleven-hour labor . . .\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe foster mother described Michael as a good baby who enjoyed being talked to and who smiled and cooed . . .\u201d\n\nMichael Wear read this clinical report about himself when as a teenager he stumbled on a folder in his parents\u2019 basement. A folder from Catholic Charities was a discovery of some of the answers, from the witnesses to his birth, to questions about where he came from, questions that other children naturally learn along the way, piecemeal. It was different for Wear, as it is for most children who are not raised by their birth parents.\n\nAlso in that folder was a loving letter to the parents who would adopt him: \u201cNever be threatened by my being his birth mother. The longing I feel for him is so intense that I could never explain it to you, but I cannot go back on my decision. I know I have made the right choice.\u201d\n\nHis birth mother continued:\n\nThe reason I am going into all of this is because I want you to try to love him without any reservation. You see, he has my love, but he won\u2019t know that 1st hand. I have had to trust many people in this past year that I never would have met if not for my pregnancy and though I am a trusting person, this is different. This tiny life was in my care until just over 2 months ago. Now he is with people I don\u2019t even know. The separation is difficult but the worry is worse. I am trusting him to you and I am sure you will make wonderful parents to him, but it\u2019s not enough to give me peace of mind. What I have turned to is God. I am entrusting him first of all to God. This brings some comfort.\n\nThe four-page letter included this, too, drenched in love and heartache: \u201cI sang to him a lot rather than talking to him. Maybe I was trying not to become too attached. I guess that didn\u2019t work, huh?\u201d\n\nIn an essay for an online magazine Catapult, Wear shares this and more. He discovered that day that, in their short time together, his birth mother loved to sing to him the song \u201cYou Are My Sunshine.\u201d He writes: \u201cI immediately thought back to the kindergarten assembly at which I\u2019d sung that song. I thought of how my love of music eventually led me to Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, and a whole catalog of songs that my grandparents fell in love to. I sang so many of those songs with them; these were some of my most treasured family memories. How much of this love of music \u2014 one I had found and cultivated myself \u2014 was, in part, a gift from my birth mother?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWear\u2019s essay is a reflection on hope. As the father of a newborn, he is still discovering things about the birth mother he has never met. Wear is making connections with her, as he holds his little girl in his arms. He writes, remembering the day during Lent last year when he and his wife discovered that they were parents of an unborn baby: \u201cThere is a profound connection between hope and parenthood. Hope requires an openness to possibility, to vulnerability and to potential disappointment.\u201d And Wear adds: \u201cWhatever I lack, . . . I have found that my history has not left me empty-handed. I, too, have a family legacy to share with my child\u2014it stretches back to my beginning, when my birth mother would sing to me, an act of audacious, generous, and loving hope as she anticipated my arrival and our parting. It recalls countless car rides with my grandparents. I have carried it forward with the songs I sing to her mother as we dance, or as we do the dishes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWear worked in the White House office of faith-based initiatives when Barack Obama was president and is the author of Reclaiming Hope: Lessons Learned in the Obama White House about the Future of Faith in America. He himself is an instrument of hope, seeking to work on issues (adoption chief among them) that can bring people together, rather than tear us further apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s no mistake or coincidence that Wear\u2019s reflection appeared during the penitential season of Lent, and at a time when we\u2019re having some brutally graphic public debates about life in its earliest stages. Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe, a friend of Saint Augustine, early bishop and one of the fathers of the Church, instructed: \u201cLet no one despair of the mercy of God, . . . but let the confidence of the person with hope seek the harbor of penance without faltering in such a way that the humility of the one with hope may drive away the deadly shipwreck of despair.\u201d\n\nIn his sharing of some of the most intimate experiences of his life, Wear is recognizing our need for heralds of hope \u2014 he certainly is one, in that humble confidence Fulgentius mentioned. Rather than the prideful exuberance that our media and politics breed through their seeming omnipresence in our lives (which we allow by keeping the screens in front of our faces long beyond what could possibly be helpful to anyone), Wear offers something different, leading with gratitude about the heroic sacrifice of one woman, his birth mother, that has made every day of his life possible. The still-unfolding story of his life and the life of his family is a reminder and a gift to the rest of us that the health of our politics reflects the health of our lives. First things first, and there may be hope for our politics yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis column is based on one available through Andrews McMeel Universal\u2019s Newspaper Enterprise Association.", "description": "In his sharing of some of the most intimate experiences of his life, Michael Wear is recognizing our need for heralds of hope", "authors": ["Kathryn Jean Lopez", "Andrew C.
