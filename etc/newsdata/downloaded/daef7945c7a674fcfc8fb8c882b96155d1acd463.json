It also would be in line with the current multilateral system, they argued, although it would enlarge both the U.S. and China\u2019s rights under current World Trade Organization rules.\n\nThe push is emblematic of the ways in which economists and other thinkers are wrestling with how to respond to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s challenge to the existing governance of the global economy. While many countries have circled the wagons to try and protect the WTO and other institutions from Trump\u2019s attacks, there is also a growing acknowledgment from many sides of politics that the current system has not worked in addressing China\u2019s economic rise and its effect on other economies.\n\nIt comes as Trump is working to close what he has described as \u201cphase one\u201d of a trade truce with China that is designed to avoid a further escalation of their trade wars. It would see China commit to resuming agricultural purchases from the U.S. at levels similar to those seen before the U.S. started imposing new tariffs last year and would put on hold the threat of further U.S. duties. It is also expected to include commitments on intellectual property reforms and currency manipulation by China.\n\nBut the interim deal, which Trump has said he hopes to sign with China\u2019s Xi Jinping at a summit in Chile next month, would crucially push discussions of other U.S. complaints such as China\u2019s industrial policies to later rounds of negotiations.\n\nThe effort unveiled Sunday was led by New York University law professor Jeffrey Lehman, Harvard economist Dani Rodrik and Yang Yao, dean of the National School of Development at Peking University. Rodrik is a long-standing critic of globalization and has advocated giving countries more \u201cpolicy space\u201d to pursue and protect domestic economic priorities, arguing that current global trading system often violates nations\u2019 sovereignty.\n\nThe statement\u2019s other signatories include former World Bank chief economists Justin Yifu Lin and Kaushik Basu.\n\nIn an interview, Rodrik said Trump\u2019s trade attack on China has shifted the debate on how to manage the economic relationship into dangerous territory. \u201cWhat he is doing is crowding out space for a more reasonable discussion,\u201d Rodrik said.\n\n\u201cWhat the United States is doing is actually engaging in a trade war and imposing tariffs as a way of forcing China into a series of economic arrangements,\u201d he said. \u201cThe modus operandi is \u2018China you are not playing by the rules of the game and we are going to raise our tariffs on you until you fall into line.\u201d\u2019\n\nAt the same time, he said, \u201cChina brings to a head the fundamental tensions of the world trading regime like nothing else\u201d and policymakers needed to realize that their expectation that China would simply \u201cfall into line\u201d with global trading rules had not worked.\n\n\u201cChina is the clearest example that that is an unrealistic expectation and because it is such a large economy it makes the tension existential,\u201d he said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Shawn Donnan in Washington at sdonnan@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Kennedy at skennedy4@bloomberg.net, Sarah McGregor, Linus Chua\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A group of prominent economists from the U.S. and China called for the world\u2019s two largest economies to abandon their trade war and agree to a new path forward that would give both countries more latitude to both pursue their own domestic economic policies and hit back at those that hurt", "authors": ["Shawn Donnan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
