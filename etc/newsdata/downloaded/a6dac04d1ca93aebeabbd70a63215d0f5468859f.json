(on.wsj.com/2kMH2kM)\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nIn the run-up to its IPO, WeWork has faced concerns over its corporate governance standards, as well as the sustainability of its business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue, and how such a model would weather an economic downturn.\n\nReuters reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter, that the company may seek a valuation of between $10 billion and $12 billion, a dramatic discount to the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January.\n\nIt is under pressure to proceed with the IPO, despite the big valuation drop, to secure funding for its operations.
