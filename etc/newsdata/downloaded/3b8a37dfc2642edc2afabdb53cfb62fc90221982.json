It will be an hour and 15 minutes and we\u2019re going to go out and practice as well as we can. That\u2019s really where our attention is.\u201d\n\nSimilar questions could have been asked before any of the 15 practices in Oxnard, or the five at the team\u2019s facility in Frisco, and Garrett\u2019s answer would have been about the same.\n\nBut there\u2019s no doubting an increasing urgency, or the growing possibility that even if the sides reach a deal in the contract stalemate this week, it might not be in time for Elliott to contribute against the first of two NFC East rivals to open the season (Washington is the second).\n\nThe two-time rushing champion missing all of the preseason wasn\u2019t a huge deal because Elliott didn\u2019t play a single snap in the exhibitions last year either. Plus, the weekend before the opener did bring word that the sides were talking and perhaps getting closer to an agreement.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Monday\u2019s practice was a bonus session after players had the weekend off following the preseason finale. The regular-season routine kicks in now, with Tuesday off before what will normally be the first full practice Wednesday.\n\nIf Elliott and the Cowboys haven\u2019t worked out their differences by then, the chances of him playing Week 1 drop considerably. The fourth overall pick from the 2016 draft has two years left on his rookie deal, at $3.9 million this season and $9.1 million in 2020.\n\nThe former Ohio State star wants to be the NFL\u2019s highest-paid back a year after Todd Gurley of the Los Angeles Rams set the standard with a $57.5 million, four-year contract with $45 million guaranteed.\n\nJudging by reaction in the locker room, Elliott\u2019s teammates were still behind him on the 39th day of his holdout.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not just a teammate, he\u2019s family,\u201d offensive lineman La\u2019el Collins said. \u201cHaving that kind of guy around, that personality, it brings everybody up. I don\u2019t know another guy with as strong a look in his eyes as Zeke. You feed off that.\u201d\n\nRookie Tony Pollard, a fourth-round pick out of Memphis, had a strong preseason and is set to be the starter if Elliott doesn\u2019t show up. Alfred Morris, the primary replacement during Elliott\u2019s six-game suspension two years ago, is the backup after rejoining Dallas early in camp.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to play with what we\u2019ve got,\u201d right guard Zack Martin, a Pro Bowler each of his first five seasons, said last week. \u201cAnd what we\u2019ve got is a damn good back in Tony Pollard. Obviously you\u2019d want him out here, but we\u2019re preparing to get ready for Week 1.\u201d\n\nOwner and general manager Jerry Jones has taken an increasingly hardline stance publicly on Elliott\u2019s absence. It started with a light-hearted \u201cZeke who?\u201d response to a reporter\u2019s question after another strong showing by Pollard in the second preseason game in Hawaii.\n\nAfter backlash from Elliott\u2019s representatives over that remark, Jones wasn\u2019t smiling a few days later when he said he had earned the right to joke with Elliott. Jones was strongly supportive of his running back - and upset with Commissioner Roger Goodell - in the legal dispute over domestic violence allegations that were the basis for Elliott\u2019s suspension.\n\nOn his most recent radio show last week, Jones finally brought up the fact Elliott wasn\u2019t honoring his contract. But that was about the same time the sides started talking again.\n\n\u201cWe were negotiating and have been negotiating all the way up until we play the Giants and that\u2019s preparation,\u201d Jones said after the preseason finale last week. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of posture, that\u2019s a part of dialogue, discussion, conjecture, it\u2019s everything that has to do with words. But when we kick off and don\u2019t have our player, then we have to play without any given player.\u201d\n\nThat time is drawing near.\n\nNOTES: Martin (back), WR Amari Cooper (foot) and LT Tyron Smith (back) returned to practice Monday after missing most of the preseason. All are expected to play against the Giants. \u2026 The Cowboys released LB Rolando McClain three days after the NFL reinstated him from an indefinite suspension over the substance-abuse policy. The Cowboys put McClain on the reserve/suspended list when he was banned in 2016. The 30-year-old last played in 2015.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ezekiel Elliott's holdout wasn't a topic when Jason Garrett addressed the Dallas Cowboys for the first time at training camp in California, or at least that's what the coach says.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/30/cowboys_preview_football_55224_c0-84-2029-1267_s1770x1032.jpg?e2cc4514e665f1d7c21bafd9aac1026f209d6a29"}
