Those who know him well speak highly of his knowledge, work ethic, enthusiasm and man-management skills.\n\nChris Silverwood, 44, has succeeded Trevor Bayliss as head coach of the England cricket team\n\nBut it\u2019s also clear that being on the inside has helped his cause. As an ECB statement put it: \u2018He is somebody we know well.\u2019\n\nThe statement praised his \u2018intimate understanding of our structures and systems\u2019, and referenced his \u2018close relationships\u2019 with Joe Root and Eoin Morgan, Test and white-ball captains respectively.\n\nKirsten, the outsider, was never going to be able to compete on that score. It seems he also paid the price for a more old-school approach. Arriving in England a week ago for his interview, he was under the impression that the job was his. Instead of an all-singing powerpoint presentation of the kind that goes down so well in the corporate world, he depicted himself as someone who would get the job done once appointed.\n\nHis expertise as a Test-match opener would have been a good fit for England\u2019s new-look top order, especially at a time when managing director Ashley Giles has promised to refocus on red-ball cricket after this summer\u2019s World Cup triumph.\n\nBut it is Silverwood who has ticked all the boxes, and who the ECB must now hope can take England back to the top of the Test rankings.", "description": "COMMENT BY LAWRENCE BOOTH: By opting for Chris Silverwood as England's new head coach ahead of Gary Kirsten, the ECB have taken a calculated gamble.", "authors": ["Lawrence Booth For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/20/19410172-0-image-a-43_1570474907065.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
