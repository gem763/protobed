India cannot afford to let reports of mass incarceration and chaos flood theirs.\u201d\n\nDisinformation has ranged from old photos from Gaza purportedly showing how India has turned Kashmir into a \u201cliving hell\u201d, to old images of happy children falsely claiming all is well in \u201cthe new Kashmir\u201d.\n\nThese have been identified by AFP\u2019s fact-checking unit, which has reported on dozens of pieces of Kashmir-related disinformation from both sides since the crisis began.\n\nFrom India, media outlets with millions of Twitter or Facebook followers have shared manipulated or out-of-context photos and videos to paint a rosy picture of life in the Kashmir Valley.\n\nThe Eid al-Adha festival, a major religious holiday for Muslims, was an early battlefront in the fake news war, occurring about a week after Kashmir\u2019s autonomy was revoked.\n\nIn the regional capital of Srinagar on that day, a curfew was in place, thousands of extra troops patrolled the streets and its main mosque was ordered shut.\n\nOnline, however, images circulated widely alongside false claims they showed people praying at mosques in Srinagar.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Digital siege\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn Pakistan, meanwhile, old, unrelated videos have been viewed millions of times in misleading posts about Kashmir shared by top politicians and journalists.\n\nIn one instance, a 2016 video showing a huge crowd at a funeral was posted on Twitter by cabinet minister Ali Haider Zaidi, who claimed it showed millions of people rallying against the revoking of autonomy.\n\nHamid Mir, a Pakistani journalist with more than five million followers on Twitter, also shared a video he claimed showed the Indian army using civilians as human shields \u2014 but the footage was from 2018.\n\nMir deleted his tweet later after being called out on Twitter by fact-checkers.\n\nFor Mumbai-based investigative journalist Rana Ayyub, the disinformation on Indian social media is part of a concerted effort by authorities to obscure a true picture of the situation in Kashmir.\n\n\u201cThe government is trying to counter this with misinformation showing misleading images to depict everything as normal,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nAyyub said Indian authorities went further in accusing international media outlets \u201cof spreading fake news\u201d when they report accurately on the situation.\n\nShe referred to Indian authorities repeatedly denying there had been any major protests or violence in Srinagar, dismissing video reports by the BBC and other global news organisations as inaccurate.\n\nHowever authorities eventually admitted there had been \u201cwidespread unrest\u201d in the city.\n\nIn Pakistan, the disinformation is driven partly by practical constraints due to a misplaced desire to draw attention to the issue, according to Shahzad Ahamd, a digital rights activist at Islamabad-based NGO Byte for All.\n\n\u201cPeople are using old images and videos to highlight the plight of Kashmiris,\u201d Ahamd told AFP, but added the strategy was backfiring.\n\n\u201cFake news is not helping, rather it has clouded the actual human misery there.\u201d\n\nRydzak, most recently a scholar at Stanford University\u2019s Global Digital Policy Incubator, said there were no winners in the fake-news war.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how the circulation of information has changed as a result of this \u2018digital siege\u2019, but it has made the task of verifying and debunking rumours harder to fulfil and the overall situation harder to control,\u201d he said.", "description": "New Delhi (AFP) \u2013 A communications blackout in India\u2019s powderkeg Kashmir region is fuelling a fake news war with Pakistan, as both sides", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/44fd68_in-absence-real-news-kashmir-waves-false-information-emerged-online-internet-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
