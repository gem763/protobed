Trade negotiations may simply be the lever the POTUS is using to pry about the US and Chinese economies.\n\nMost people have followed our dealings with China understand the PRC is a massive cheater when it comes to trade vs. the US. By means of tariff- and non-tariff barriers, by massive theft of intellectual property, by an enormous industrial espionage effort, the PRC cheats. They've cheated for so long, and successive administrations have looked the other way, the PRC thinks it is entitled to cheat. The result: $500 billion of wealth each year is sent to the PRC from the US, and is used to pay for the Red Army. Subsidizing our geopolitical rival is madness.\n\nFar better to drive American supply-chains currently in China to other countries --- any other country will do! Bilateral, balanced trade can easily be negotiated between the US and India or Indonesia or Vietnam. But never with the PRC. Their goal is to have the US continue to pay for them to supplant us in Asia. Trade with China? Its national suicide, long-term.\n\nMoving those supply chains OUT of China deprives the PRC of that $500 billion/year subsidy. It reduces their tax base. It reduces their manufacturing base below what it otherwise will be. In short, it takes our strategic competitor down a few notches. Meanwhile, there are billion of wannabe workers in other parts of Asia and Africa. We can help them while doing the smart-thing, geo-politically speaking.\n\nThe US doesn't need China. The US began as a small insignificant colony of a European power. During the span of 200 years it grew to economic pre-eminence. And during those 200 years, we had virtually NO trade with China. This idea that the sky will fall if we aren't attached at the hip to a statist, murderous regime is bizarre propaganda. People have been brainwashed.\n\nI like your way of thinking. However do you believe GM, Ford, Apple etc. will give up willingly? A lot of stuff to be sold there.\n\n@CarlosDS: You don\u2019t get it. It ain\u2019t abouth TPP. It\u2019s about China\u2019s way of doing business by confiscating US technology. TPP would not have solved that problem.", "description": "I told my wife last night Trump is going to tweet about China Monday morning because the stock market was down...and boom, it did.
