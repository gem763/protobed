These concerns and fears are still very real as the overnight credit market continues to illustrate. Yet, the precious metals have retraced from recent highs and begun to form a momentum base which will likely become the floor for the next move higher.\n\nThe one aspect that many traders don\u2019t grasp just yet is that the US market could continue to push higher, just as they\u2019ve done over the past few months, while precious metals continue to push higher, just as they\u2019ve done over the past few months. The reality is the fear and greed driving the upside price move in metals is related to foreign market concerns (China/Asia, Europe/EU/BREXIT, Arab/Iran/Israel, and others). The true fear is that some type of war or economic event will start while the global markets are fragile. The recent news that the overnight Repo Market is seizing is another indication that the global credit market is very fragile. What will it take to launch metals higher? We believe the world is waiting for this next event to happen while this momentum base continues to set up.\n\nGOLD DAILY CHART\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nThis Daily chart highlights the momentum base setup between $1480 and $1525. Any entry below $1500 is a relatively solid entry point for skilled technical traders. The next upside target based on our Fibonacci price modeling tool is $1795. Thus, the real upside move potential at this point is another 20% for Gold.\n\nSILVER DAILY CHART\n\nSilver is setting up a similar momentum base pattern after reaching levels just below $20 per ounce. We still believe the early October breakout date is relevant and we believe the next upside target will be between $21 to $24 in Silver. Any entry level below $17.60 is a solid area for skilled technical traders preparing for the next upside price leg.\n\nSilver Daily Chart\n\nThere has been a lot of talk from analysts and researchers that prices could rally well past $5,000 if the markets collapse. One analysis came out recently and suggest Gold could rally above $23,000. We are a bit more conservative with our initial upside target of $3,750.\n\nThe bottom line is you really don\u2019t want to miss this opportunity in the precious metals markets once it forms a bottom and starts to rally. This recent price rotation is a gift for skilled technical traders. If you were to take a minute and really consider how precious metals would react to a foreign market credit collapse on top of the potential for a collapsing economic outlook resulting from the credit collapse, you\u2019ll quickly understand that trillions of dollars will be seeking safety and security in the metals markets in due time. \u2013 Chris Vermeulen", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Commodity Trade Mantra  covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures.
