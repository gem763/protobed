He has said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than do so.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker sought to focus MPs\u2019 minds, saying Brussels can see no need to prolong the tortuous three-year Brexit process \u2014 although the decision to delay, if requested by London, would be for EU leaders.\n\n\u201cThere is no choice between Brexit or no Brexit: it\u2019s a choice between deal or no deal,\u201d Luxembourg\u2019s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said Friday.\n\n\u2013 \u2018This is our chance\u2019 \u2013\n\nJohnson took office in July vowing to keep to the October 31 Brexit deadline, deal or no deal.\n\nHe pledged to renegotiate the most contentious elements of a divorce text agreed by his predecessor Theresa May with Brussels last year, which was rejected by MPs three times.\n\nThe compromise deal that was finally struck on Thursday has a new arrangement for keeping open the border between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we are very close to the final stretch,\u201d EU Council President Donald Tusk said after the bloc\u2019s leaders endorsed the text.\n\nJohnson has assured his European counterparts that he can get the deal through the Commons, where he requires the support of 319 other MPs to guarantee backing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident that when my colleagues in parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday, and then in succeeding days,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cThis is our chance in the UK as democrats to get Brexit done, and come out on October 31.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Wooing Labour rebels \u2013\n\nHowever, the DUP has said it cannot support the plans, as efforts to avoid checks on the Irish land border would lead to new trade barriers between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.\n\nThe main opposition Labour, Scottish National and Liberal Democrat parties are also against.\n\nThe pound had risen to five-month peaks on news of the deal.\n\nHowever sterling dipped about 0.1 percent against the dollar on Friday as investors continued to fret over Johnson\u2019s chances of success.\n\nJohnson will meet with and call MPs to try to win support for his deal throughout Friday, a Downing Street official said.\n\nWith the numbers extremely close, he needs to win over Labour MPs representing Brexit-supporting constituencies.\n\nThe Labour leadership objects to the new deal because it paves the way for looser ties between Britain and the EU than were previously envisaged. The party wants a second referendum on any deal.\n\n\u201cWe should just vote the deal down because it\u2019s such a bad deal,\u201d Labour finance spokesman John McDonnell told BBC radio.\n\n\u201cIt is a sell-out.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s eurosceptic newspapers backed Johnson\u2019s deal, which comes more than three years after Britons voted narrowly to leave the EU in a referendum that has left the country bitterly divided.\n\n\u201cGet real\u2026 take the deal!\u201d said The Sun\u2019s front page, while the Daily Mail went for \u201cHe\u2019s done his duty. Now MPs must do theirs\u201d, and the Daily Express said \u201cJust do it!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the Financial Times called for a second referendum, while the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror said the best thing about Johnson\u2019s deal was that it was better than no deal.\n\nThe Times urged lawmakers to back the agreement, while The Daily Telegraph said parliament \u201cmust not scupper this chance\u201d.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched a charm offensive on Friday to sell his Brexit deal to sceptical MPs, with a looming", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/defe8b_britain-prime-minister-boris-johnson-has-insisted-he-dead-in-ditch-delay-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
