You need to understand who you are, what you want to be and where you are headed.\n\nOnce you have definite answers to these questions, then is the ideal time for you to be seeking a soulmate relationship.\n\nIf you are here, it's fair to assume that you are in love with yourself and, at the same time, you are in love with another being. But no matter how strong the relationship, its important to know whether the person you committed to, is or has the potential to be your soulmate.\n\nIn order to remove that doubt, we have prepared a list of all the unromantic signs that beautifully prove that the person you are with is your soulmate. Take notice: these are unromantic signs, considering romance and extravagance is so easy to master, it's the little small gestures that matter. So take out your pen and start with this checklist now!\n\n1. You both can sit in silence without feeling weird about it.\n\nPexels\n\nYou have REALLY found a soulmate if both of you don't feel the constant urge to make small talk. Silence can only be shared when there is sincere love and insane level of comfort!\n\nDon't Miss\n\n2. You both can have an insane time anywhere.\n\nPexels\n\nWhether it's getting drunk and going crazy at weddings or being goofy in serious situations, you both have a really good time with each other everywhere and anywhere.\n\n3. You have developed your own language.\n\nPexels\n\nYou both have developed your own language comprising of signs, signals, eye rolls, quotes, inside jokes and sentences that could mean something totally different to a third person but this secret code works for both you. And this how it should be!\n\n4. You both can openly talk about bodily functions.\n\nPexels\n\nWhether its a burp or a fart, both of you aren't running to the other rooms, when any of these happen. These are normal bodily functions that can now shamelessly take place in front of your partner, because why not.\n\n5. You both love dressing up for each other but your favourite outfits for each other are tracks, shorts and old t-shirts.\n\nPexels\n\nIt's always fun to dress up and ignite the romance with your partner. But you both are so comfortable with each other now that there is no need to dress up or put an effort. He doesn't have to shave or she doesn't have to put make-up every time you see each other. He could be in boxers and a t-shirt. She could be in an old t-shirt and in shorts and you guys would still get it on for and with each other.\n\n6. You enjoy dining out as much as ordering take out and chilling at home.\n\nPexels\n\nWhile fancy dates are awesome and you both should indulge in them from time to time, what's important is how you equally enjoy chilling at home, ordering take out and just watching shows or movies, without effort.\n\n7. You both can openly state how both of you are annoying the hell out of each other.\n\nPexels\n\nAnd none of you ever get upset. Because annoying or irritating your partner is adorable. But don't over do it so they go away.\n\n8. You both don't have to worry about sleeping next to each-other.\n\nPexels\n\nHe could take the entire bed. She could sleep with her mouth-open with saliva dripping down. It doesn't matter. Because you and your partner love sleeping together in the most innocent and non-innocent sense of the phrase. So cherish these moments where love can foster and awkwardness has officially died down.\n\n9. It doesn't get awkward when any one of you is sick.\n\nPexels\n\nMost people run the other way when it comes to caring for someone who is down with cold, cough or fever. But you know this partner is your soulmate when all cringe, creepy and awkward feelings are out of the picture and the focus is on treating them and making them feel better.\n\n10. You would rather spend an entire lame day with them than go crazy with someone else.\n\nPexels\n\nYou would pick spending a day with them doing absolutely nothing than going over the top with any body else.\n\n11. You have stopped imagining what life would be without your partner because they aren't going anywhere.\n\nPexels\n\nYou are SO over stressing over all the little things that could go wrong in your relationship. Now, you both are so strong that all those mini arguments and baseless fights will not break you. You are stuck with each other for life.", "description": "No matter how strong the relationship, its important to know whether the person you committed to, is or has the potential to be your soulmate.
