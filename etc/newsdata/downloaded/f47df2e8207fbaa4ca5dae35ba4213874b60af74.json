That certainly was not my intent,\u201d Bacow wrote in a message emailed on Saturday morning to the university\u2019s alumni relations and development staff.\n\nBacow referenced the 13th Amendment in response to a question about \"The Harvard Campaign\" -- a concept adopted by his predecessor, Drew Faust, as part of a university-wide fundraising effort to encourage donors to give to schools they have no connection to.\n\nSome schools, such as Harvard Business School, receive an abundance of donations from rich alumni who work on Wall Street or Silicon Valley, while other schools, such the Graduate School of Education, have alumni who go into teaching or work in the nonprofit sector and have less money to donate.\n\n(MORE: DOJ backs claim Harvard illegally discriminates against Asian-Americans)\n\nBacow said he now realizes his ill-advised analogy left some attendees feeling \"unsettled.\"\n\nPHOTO: Lawrence Bacow speaks as he is introduced as Harvard University's 29th president during a news conference on February 11, 2018 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
