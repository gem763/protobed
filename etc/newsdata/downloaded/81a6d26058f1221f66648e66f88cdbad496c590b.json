Together they are known as the big three.\n\nState Street handles investments worth at least $38.3bn in publicly listed fossil fuel companies, according to an analysis for the Guardian by InfluenceMap. Its stakes afford it a say on company directors, as well shareholder decisions on improving emissions disclosures and ensuring companies are aligned with the Paris agreement.\n\nThe State Street boss pointed to its \u201caggressive\u201d historical voting record on issues such as gender diversity on boards, and suggested climate change could become a priority, but refused to give a defined timescale.\n\nLarge asset managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard have faced criticism for routinely voting against efforts to improve climate-related financial disclosures, appointing board directors to deal with climate-related business risk and publishing substantive emissions data. State Street\u2019s record is mixed, although O\u2019Hanley\u2019s comments could signal an escalation in the firm\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cIf we conclude that a company\u2019s board is not taking into account these risks then we will either vote all the board out or we\u2019ll use our vote against the board or we\u2019ll use it against individuals on the board that we think should be acting and aren\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo it could be against the company chairman, against the head of the risk committee, but that is our strongest tool, our vote. And it\u2019s a powerful tool because although it only takes a majority for someone to be voted in, typically if a significant minority has voted against a particular individual on the board that\u2019s generally taken as a lack of confidence and that will cause the person to leave, so these votes are important. It\u2019s a high responsibility and we understand that.\u201c\n\nLarge asset managers, who do not own companies but exercise shareholder powers on behalf of clients, are uniquely positioned to hold the boards of oil and gas companies to account on the climate crisis and ensure a green energy transition.\n\nO\u2019Hanley told the Guardian that State Street preferred to discuss politically sensitive corporate governance issues such as the climate crisis, background checks on gun purchases in the US and board diversity in private with companies at first, opting to use its voting power as a last resort to demand action.\n\nHe added: \u201cOur work doesn\u2019t revolve just around the vote. I mean at this moment, now, the entire team is out engaging with our various portfolio companies. They do this all day every day and they\u2019re, on a company-by-company basis, developing a perspective on whether or not the board has this.\n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s very dangerous to just say that every oil and gas company ought to have its board voted out. I mean \u2026 Put it this way, some of the best technology that\u2019s going to get us through this is actually coming from oil and gas companies, right, if you look at what some of them are doing on renewables.\n\n\u201cCarbon capture, the leading carbon capture technology at the moment is Occidental [Petroleum]. Without Occidental, society wouldn\u2019t be as far along as it is on carbon capture. It\u2019s not as easy as saying let\u2019s just vote the whole lot out.\u201d\n\nNegative emissions technology such as carbon capture has been put forward by the oil and gas industry as a solution to the climate crisis, but there is widespread scepticism about its long-term viability.\n\nPushed on when State Street would start using its vote more aggressively, O\u2019Hanley said: \u201cWe engage as investment analysts do with each of the companies, determine where they are in dealing with this risk and overseeing this risk. And if our conclusion is they\u2019re not then we will take a vote, but we don\u2019t have a quota of votes.\n\n\u201cIt could be very much in the next season, it could be in 15 years we\u2019re voting out people.\u201d\n\nThe asset management veteran also agreed that the industry must do more to improve disclosures around green and sustainable investing. Asked why State Street offered some fossil-fuel-free investment funds that had clear exposure to the fossil fuel industry, O\u2019Hanley said his company was working hard to improve information about so-called environmental, sustainable and governance (ESG) investing, the acronym used for green investing.\n\n\u201cOne person\u2019s ESG isn\u2019t another person\u2019s ESG. Part of this comes down to definitions and again, we would completely agree with you that there needs to be some kind of measurement here. We\u2019re working quite hard on that. We\u2019re working with some of the largest index providers in the world and you will see us announcing a few tools in a very short time frame that will help address that very problem that you\u2019re stating,\u201d O\u2019Hanley said.", "description": "State Street chief says it could use shareholder powers to force boards to act on climate", "authors": ["Patrick Greenfield"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8c1d248f95f77f40f6379f4532ceecfce02e723/0_32_3388_2033/master/3388.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79ac370ed787adac77b31d5fcc40e2a4", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
