It\u2019s the myth that private markets are superior to public markets.\n\nInvestors have long been told that the stars of the financial universe are hedge fund, venture capital and private equity managers. These supposedly visionary geniuses are said to be immune to the short-term thinking that poisons the public markets. Investment horizons should be longer, risks lower, returns higher.\n\nSince 2008, pension funds, university endowments and other giant investors have poured roughly $2 trillion into private vehicles on that promise. Individual investors have seldom been allowed past the velvet rope\u2014but, as the We debacle shows, that isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\nNot long ago, We\u2019s venture-capital backers valued it at $47 billion. The proposed IPO faltered when public investors signaled they wouldn\u2019t value the company much above $15 billion\u2014implying the supposedly sophisticated private market had been pricing We at roughly three times what it is worth.\n\nSecond Opinion Unicorns often fall in value when they go public, though We Co.\u2019s prospective drop is sizable.

The company lost nearly $1.4 billion on $1.5 billion in revenue in the first half of 2019. Public investors didn\u2019t find any of that amusing.\n\nNo wonder, in a videoconference earlier this week, We\u2019s founder and chief executive, Adam Neumann, told employees the company has \u201cplayed the private-market game to perfection,\u201d as my colleague Eliot Brown reported. Public markets, he added, were a different story.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What has been your experience with private vs. public markets? Join the conversation below.\n\nA spokesman for We declined to comment. Mr. Neumann\u2019s remark, though, shows how hollow the narrative about the superiority of private markets is. They may be more prone to error than public markets are\u2014not less.\n\nMarkets work best when they are both deep and wide, integrating sharp differences of opinion from many people into a single price at which investments can trade.\n\nPrivate markets, however, are shallow and narrow, despite their enormous size.\n\nNon-registered securities offerings totaled $3 trillion in 2017, estimates the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2014twice the size of public offerings for stocks and bonds.\n\nYet in these clubby circles\u2014non-traded real estate, infrastructure portfolios of airports and highways, venture capital that nurtures startup firms and private-equity funds that buy up entire companies\u2014relatively few investors determine what investments are worth, often based on similar viewpoints. Short selling, or betting that prices will fall, doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cNormal markets consist of pessimists, neutral people and optimists, who can take either side of a trade so the price can settle to some kind of equilibrium,\u201d says Michael Mauboussin, director of research at BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, an investment firm in New York. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case in a private market, where it\u2019s difficult to sell and pessimists can\u2019t easily express a view.\u201d\n\nExpectation vs. Reality Unicorns whose IPO valuations were lower or higher than the valuation given at their last VC round Value went up Value went down So far this year, two of 14 unicorns that went public had a haircut 2011 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 \u201919 Year of IPO\n\nSo pricing is primarily in the hands of optimists.\n\nAccording to PitchBook Data, 66 companies valued at $1 billion or more have done initial public offerings from 2011 through mid-September 2019. A third of those IPOs came at prices below the value set in the companies\u2019 last round of private funding. Bloom Energy Corp. , Cloudera Inc., Domo Inc., Reata Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Zynga Inc. all launched IPOs priced at least 40% lower than the valuation in their final private-funding round, according to PitchBook.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because conventional valuation methods may overstate what private funds\u2019 venture holdings are worth. Often, several share classes are valued equally even though they aren\u2019t all entitled to the same payoffs.\n\nOr perhaps the brilliance of the private market is overstated. Consider a recent survey of nearly 900 venture capitalists.\n\nAsked whether they \u201coften make a gut decision to invest\u201d in a fledgling company rather than relying on analysis, 44% of venture-fund executives said yes.\n\nWhich financial metrics do they use to analyze investments? \u201cNone,\u201d admitted 9% of respondents. Only 11% quantitatively analyze past investment performance. A similar survey of private-equity executives found that they \u201cdo not frequently use\u201d the methods that are standard among public investors for discounting the future cash their holdings might generate.\n\nAre \u201cunicorns\u201d\u2014those startups already worth more than $1 billion in the private market\u2014overvalued? Yes, said 91% of venture capitalists who don\u2019t have any unicorns in their portfolio. And yes, said 92% of the VCs who do.\n\nNo one disputes that when private investments pay off, they pay off hugely. But the gap between the best and the worst is vast. And, on average over time, they don\u2019t tend to outperform public markets by wide margins\u2014especially when adjusted for risk, the boost that borrowed money can give and the inability to withdraw your capital at will.\n\nA few investors with oceans of capital, great connections and superb analytical skills may be able to pick the winners in private markets. Most others, large and small, shouldn\u2019t feel as if they\u2019re missing out on a sure way to strike it rich.", "description": "WeWork\u2019s postponed IPO shows how hollow the narrative about the superiority of private markets can be.", "authors": ["Jason Zweig", "Intelligentinvestor Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FA590_INVEST_SOC_20190920110053.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
