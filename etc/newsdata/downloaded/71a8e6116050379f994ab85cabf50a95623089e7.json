It was after this summit that Kim Jong-un hinted at scrapping the weapons test moratorium and demanded Trump to come up with mutually acceptable proposals by December. To add to the heightening tensions, Trump also rejected Kim Jong-un\u2019s calls for sanction relief in exchange for partially surrendering nuclear capabilities.\n\nOn Saturday, police in Sweden closed off the approaches to the complex facing the Baltic Sea on the island of Lidingo, where the delegations led by US Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun and North Korea's Kim Myong Gil were expected to meet.\n\nTwo motorcades entered the secluded centre early in the day with a police officer confirming one carried the North Korean officials. The other included cars used by Biegun when he met Swedish Foreign Ministry officials on Friday.\n\nThe delegation from North Korea, also known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which is under sanctions banning much of its trade due to its nuclear programme, arrived in Sweden on Thursday after Pyongyang unexpectedly said talks would take place on October 5.", "description": "An isolated conference centre on the outskirts of Stockholm was the setting on Saturday for the US and North Korea to resume nuclear talks.", "authors": ["Heather Donald"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/86/40/1000x563_cmsv2_1db5cbc5-20ee-5211-aaa8-99d2237296a6-4208640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
