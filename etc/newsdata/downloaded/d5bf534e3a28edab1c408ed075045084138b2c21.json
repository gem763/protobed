A pre-peeled orange in a plastic box. Shrink-wrapped cucumbers.\n\nOver-packaged food has been bothering shoppers for years and supermarkets have responded by looking for alternatives to all that plastic.\n\nBut now MPs are saying that the UK needs to move away from all single-use packaging - not just plastic.\n\nUsing aluminium, glass, paper or compostable plastics as an alternative also has an environmental impact, potentially pushing up energy use and carbon emissions, says a report by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee.\n\nIt says reuse and refill schemes could be part of the solution and wants the government to consider whether official intervention could encourage more shops to offer refillable options.\n\nHere we look at how five leading supermarkets are tackling the packaging problem.\n\nWaitrose\n\nTarget: To eliminate single-use plastic\n\nCurrent usage: 31,000 tonnes of plastic in 2018\n\nGreenpeace ranking on plastic policies: 3rd\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What do shoppers think about Waitrose's trial?\n\nWaitrose is ahead of the pack when it comes to reuse and refill schemes.\n\nSince June, customers at its Botley Road store in Oxford have been filling their own containers with pasta from large jars, beer on tap and pick 'n' mix frozen fruit, doing away with packaging altogether.\n\nAnd it's proved such a hit (more than 90% of its customers want it to continue) that it's rolling out the scheme in Cheltenham, Abingdon and Wallingford by the end of the year.\n\nOther measures include:\n\nRemoving all black plastic from own label ranges. (Waitrose has already removed black plastic on fresh meat, poultry, fish and fruit and veg)\n\nIntroducing coloured packaging made from recycled plastic for ready meals\n\nAllowing customers to bring their own containers to the meat, fish or cheese counter\n\nReplacing all single use fruit and veg bags with a home compostable alternative (banana bags are covered in the words \"home compostable bag\" and a suggestion to use it as a food waste caddy liner)\n\nRemoving single use coffee cups saving 52 million cups a year\n\nEnsuring all own-label cards, wraps, crackers, tags, flowers and plants are glitter-free by Christmas 2020\n\nTesco\n\nTarget: To remove hard-to-recycle materials, including PVC and polystyrene\n\nCurrent usage: 252,500 tonnes of plastic packaging in 2017\n\nGreenpeace ranking on plastic policies: 5th\n\nThe biggest of the \"big four\" says it's on target to to eliminate the hardest to recycle materials from its own brand products by the end of the year, but it will take longer to get its suppliers to do the same.\n\nIn the meantime, it's turning its attention to excessive packaging, pointing to the half-filled crisp packets and the airy cereal boxes on the shelves.\n\nFrom next year, it will assess the size and suitability of packaging of every product it stocks - and will weed out any that don't make the grade.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does Loop work?\n\nIn early 2020, Tesco will trial a new online delivery scheme called Loop, essentially a modern take on the milkman.\n\nTesco will deliver products ordered online to homes in reusable containers that will then be collected, cleaned and refilled.\n\nThe idea behind it is to eliminate unnecessary waste before it happens.\n\nOther measures include:\n\nTurning Tesco Extra in Cambridge into a trial store to look at new ways to reduce waste. For example selling multi-buys for the same price as multipacks, usually bound up in plastic, and an aisle selling only loose fruit and veg. If these moves work, they could be rolled out across the UK. Other options would then include scrapping multipack tins, getting rid of binders on beer cans and removing cutlery from the store's \"on the go\" range\n\nExploring new technologies to make recyclable film lids and pouches\n\nScrapping plastic bags with home delivery orders\n\nSainsbury's\n\nTarget: To halve plastic packaging by 2025\n\nCurrent usage: Almost 120,000 tonnes of plastic packaging in a year\n\nGreenpeace ranking on plastic policies: 10th\n\nImage copyright Sainsbury's\n\nLast year the UK's second biggest supermarket reduced plastic packaging by just 1% and came bottom in Greenpeace's survey.\n\nBut it looks as though the supermarket is now swinging into action, setting itself what it calls an ambitious target.\n\nSome new measures include:\n\nRemoving lightweight loose produce bags from this month\n\nGetting rid of plastic trays from asparagus, sweetcorn, tomatoes, carrots and herb pots\n\nEncouraging customers to bring their own containers to meat and deli counters\n\nReplacing plastic film on fruit and vegetables with a recyclable alternative by the end of next year\n\nSwitching PVC and polystyrene trays for a recyclable alternative. Options are currently being reviewed\n\nDoing the same for fresh food black plastic trays by the end of this year. These will be replaced with products made from a natural CPET material, a form of recyclable plastic\n\nTrialling a \"pre-cycle\" area in stores where shoppers can remove unwanted packaging and leave it for recycling\n\nPiloting deposit return schemes so shoppers can return recyclable packaging easily\n\nSainsbury's acknowledges it can't reach its target on its own, saying shoppers will have to change their behaviour.\n\nFor example, the supermarket is looking at options to replace milk bottles, one of the shop's largest sources of plastic packaging. This could mean refillable bottles, returnable milk bottles or offering a reusable jug with milk in a plastic pouch.\n\nWhile the supermarket works closely with other retailers, manufacturers, packaging suppliers, scientists and recycling experts to find solutions, it is asking its customers to pitch in their ideas too.\n\nAsda\n\nTarget: To use the least amount of any material possible\n\nCurrent usage: 65,500 tonnes of plastic packaging a year\n\nGreenpeace ranking on plastic policies: 6th\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nAsda says it's trying to use less and recycle more, in that order. Since February 2018, it says its removed 6,500 tonnes of plastic - the equivalent of 600 million empty plastic bottles - from own brand products.\n\nOther measures include:\n\nTrialling a new type of coating on fresh produce, which could double the shelf life. The \"extra peel\", made from materials that exist in seeds and fruit and veg pulp, was used on a shipment of clementines to Chatham in Kent and Glasshoughton in West Yorkshire. The coating, approved for use by the EU Commission in June, protects the fruit from spoilage for longer and could reduce the amount of packaging required to prolong shelf life\n\nRemoving plastic wrapping from more than 50 million greetings cards, unwrapping 6 million swedes and removing unnecessary films, trays and windows\n\nEncouraging shoppers to bring their own reusable fruit and veg bags\n\nSaving 375 million single-use carrier bags by no longer offering them in store or for online shopping\n\nSelling refillable cleaning products (Asda first trialled refillable fabric conditioner machines in 2010)\n\nAldi\n\nTarget: 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging across all products by 2025\n\nCurrent usage: Not provided\n\nGreenpeace ranking on plastic policies: 8th\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe German discount supermarket has 13 pledges on plastics and packaging. They've been stripping the plastic from their tomatoes, broccoli, potatoes and aubergines, and have a number of other measures in the pipeline, including:\n\nTrialling paper and compostable carrier bags after scrapping 5p single-use carrier bags. The most popular will be rolled out in all stores\n\nRemoving difficult-to-recycle packaging including expanded polystyrene, PVC and non-detectable black plastic from the shop's food range by the end of 2020\n\nRemoving non-biodegradable glitter from Halloween and Christmas ranges by the end of 2020\n\nLosing the plastic packaging on cabbages and cauliflower in stores in Scotland and parts of England\n\nScrapping plastic packaging on multipacks of tinned tuna\n\nUsing cardboard rather than polystyrene pizza bases\n\nTrialling wrapping toilet rolls in paper, rather than plastic\n\nTrialling cardboard packaging on steak\n\nMorrisons\n\nTarget: To reduce plastic packaging by a quarter and have 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025\n\nCurrent usage: Around 100,000 tonnes of plastic packaging in a year\n\nGreenpeace ranking on plastic policies: 2nd\n\nThe UK's fourth-biggest grocer, which came second in Greenpeace's survey, has led the way in letting customers make use of reusable containers.\n\nSince 2018, customers have been able to fill their own containers with items from the meat and fish counters - it says it has removed 1.8m meat and fish trays from its stores.\n\nIt also trialled a reuse and refill scheme for produce such as pasta, seeds and frozen fruit.\n\nImage copyright Morrisons\n\nMorrisons' focus has also been on providing unpackaged produce. It says it has the highest proportion of loose fruit and vegetable sales of any supermarket and it is introducing a special area for these products in 60 of its stores this year.\n\nThe supermarket says it is working through all of its own brand products to identify, reduce and remove any unnecessary plastic packaging.\n\nOther measures include:", "description": "The UK needs to move away from all single-use packaging, say MPs.
