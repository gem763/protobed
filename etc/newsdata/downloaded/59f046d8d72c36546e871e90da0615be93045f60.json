A lump developed on my neck and the doctors didn\u2019t initially know what was happening or what exactly was wrong. My mother took me to Red Cross War Memorial Children\u2019s Hospital when she noticed that the swelling on my neck had spread to my backside,\u201d Mciki told City Press.\n\n\n\nThe then unexplained swelling left his arms locked, which meant he could not learn to crawl or walk as other babies could.\n\nDr Christiaan Scott, who has a special interest in FOP and is the head of paediatric rheumatology at the Red Cross War Memorial Children\u2019s Hospital, said: \u201cFOP is unusual and unique in the sense that it\u2019s the only condition we know of where one tissue in the body can turn another into something else. It sounds absolutely bizarre, but it boils down to a single mutation that acts as an inhibitor of the system that makes bone. This ACVR1 protein mutation, as it\u2019s called, is the lock that sits on this system and develops the skeleton. If not tightly controlled, you get an over-expression of the urge to make skeleton and your body just makes more skeleton and more bone than it\u2019s supposed to.\u201d\n\nThere is currently no cure for the condition. It can be detected as early as when a child is born as its first visible sign is a malformation of the big toe.\n\nMciki \u2013 who was born before anything was known about the disease \u2013 underwent many operations and invasive physical investigations in hospital by doctors who didn\u2019t know any better, and these caused more harm than good.\n\nIn 1989, US doctor Fred Kaplan, an orthopaedic surgeon, met a child with FOP.\n\nMotivated to know and do more, Kaplan began a pioneering second career in FOP research \u2013 work that led to the discovery of the FOP gene, the seminal target for all therapeutic efforts for this condition.\n\n\u201cThey were trying to correct my frozen shoulders,\u201d Mciki said, but, instead, the constant trauma his body was being subjected to made the disease worse.\n\nKaplan, who arrived in the country last week, told City Press how harmful surgeries and probes such as biopsies were for a patient with FOP, as they added more signals to the gene to create more bone.\n\n\n\nKaplan is often described as \u201cthe godfather of FOP\u201d as working on understanding the disease came to define his life\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cI realised that no one was working on what this condition was, and all my colleagues would say to me that I should rather work on more common conditions such as arthritis. But, had I done that, what of the other children years later who would still have this condition no one knew about?\u201d he said.\n\nAs Mciki grew, so did the condition. He is immobile and uses a specialised wheelchair, but his brain is as sharp as ever.\n\nHe said that he had enrolled at Unisa for a BCom qualification, but had to withdraw because of a lack of funds.\n\nHowever, that didn\u2019t stop him from completing other smaller courses over the years because \u201cI wanted to still make something of myself\u201d.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the spirit Schwegler said was most amazing among all the survivors interviewed for the film.\n\n\u201cThis journey has touched me in many ways. The survivors are examples of the best of humanity \u2026 about humanity and living in the moment,\u201d she said.\n\nKaplan describes the time he started researching the disease as a \u201cwasteland\u201d because nothing was known about it and there were no tools or even equipment to help make a diagnosis.\n\nOf the film, he said: \u201cIf one mother in a remote area in the world can watch it and say \u2018this is what my child has\u2019, it will have been a victory.\u201d", "description": "Thozamile Mciki was just eight months old when his body began to build a second skeleton.", "authors": ["Vuyo Mkize"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8958/a09a0fca417c4cf9a9e8d37a0fdcd00e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
