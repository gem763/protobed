Nightmares are a normal part of child development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018As children start to learn about the dangers in the world, as well as what death means when they are about 8-years-old, nightmares can be the brain\u2019s way of processing this new information.\n\n\u2018Lavender is really relaxing for the senses, so this will help. I would advise to start using this spray an hour before bed, to help stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, and also to initiate the release of melatonin, the hormone that induces sleep.\u2019\n\nThe product costs \u00a34.95 but it\u2019s proved so popular, it\u2019s currently sold out online so the team behind it at Cuckooland has released the recipe and instructions on how to make it at home.\n\nHow to make nightmare spray Grab yourself a spray bottle \u2013 something recyclable and sustainable, a glass bottle perhaps and fill with water.\n\nMix two drops of essential oil per every 100ml of water. Lavender or rose oils are good to use, given their relaxing qualities, but other essential oils can be used as well, why not experiment and find the best fit for your little ones?\n\nFinally you need to decorate the bottle and add some \u2018secret anti monster\u2019 ingredients. Decorate with friendly ghosts, smiley faces and lots of bright colours.\n\nMORE: Amazon is selling Christmas tree beds for your beloved cat\n\nMORE: Just how chaotic is Scorpio season going to be?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cuckooland is selling an anti-nightmare spray and now you can make your own at home with this recipe.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93197763_1572253517.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
