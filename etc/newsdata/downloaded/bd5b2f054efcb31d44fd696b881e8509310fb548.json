In cellphone video from witnesses that captured the final moments of the shooting spree, the postal van speeds into view and slams into a police cruiser outside the movie theater in Odessa. A burst of gunfire followed as officers who had been chasing the van rushed out and shot the gunman, who appeared to still be inside the van.\n\nThe authorities said Sunday that the seven people killed in the attack ranged in age from 15 to 57, including Mary Granados, 29, the driver of the postal van. The Postal Inspection Service said Ms. Granados was a letter carrier, that it was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d at her death, and that it was working closely with other agencies on the investigation.\n\nA total of 22 people were wounded, officials said, including three law enforcement officers and a 17-month-old toddler who was recovering Sunday from injuries that included shrapnel in her chest.\n\nThe attack on Saturday spread panic and fear for hours across West Texas, hundreds of miles from the border city of El Paso, where four weeks earlier a gunman had killed 22 people at a Walmart in an anti-Hispanic attack.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, federal agents executed a search warrant at what appeared to be Mr. Ator\u2019s residence, in a remote area of mobile homes at the western edge of Ector County, which includes Odessa. A neighbor, Rocio Martinez, 29, described Mr. Ator as a \u201cloner\u201d who kept to himself and who sometimes frightened her because he was always firing guns outside.", "description": "Twenty-two others were wounded, including three law enforcement officers and a 17-month-old who remained in serious condition Sunday morning.", "authors": ["Lucinda Holt", "Manny Fernandez"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/02/us/01subodessa2-print/01subodessa2-print-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
