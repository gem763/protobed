If you're right-handed, you've probably never noticed them before.\n\nThe pens at the bank are always attached on the right side.\n\nWhen you have to pull the pen over to the left side, the cord always gets in the way of what you're trying to write.\n\nThe flap covering the zippers on pants blocks easy access from the left side.\n\nIt's weird to reach around with the left hand and zip up from the other side.\n\nIf you hold a glass measuring cup in your left hand, you're stuck with metric measurements.\n\nDiehard lefty bakers might want to invest in a left-handed version of the classic cup.\n\nWhen you're left-handed, writing in spiral notebooks and three-ring binders is a special kind of torture.\n\nThe rings make it impossible for left-handed people to lay their hands flat on the page and write normally. The best solution is usually to wedge the left hand between the top two rings when writing on the top half of the page, then wedge it between the bottom two rings when writing on the bottom half.\n\nSpoiler alert: It is not comfortable.\n\nEvery time you swipe a credit card, it's on the right side of the machine.\n\nReaching over and swiping the card downward in your left hand feels weird. Of course, switching it to the right hand usually feels even weirder.\n\nOld-school can openers only work well in the right hand. Lefties have to reach across the can and turn the crank at a really awkward angle.\n\nThis hard to picture, so here's a video that shows what happens when a lefty uses a right-handed can opener. Good thing there's no shortage of lefty versions online.\n\nRemember those desks with the chair attached? Definitely not made for lefties.\n\nIn a classroom like these, lefties don't get the luxury of resting their elbows on anything.\n\nThe number pad on keyboards? Of course it's on the right.\n\nLefties plagued by this design can purchase left-handed keyboards with the number pad on the left.\n\nThis is what it looks like when a lefty tries to use right-handed scissors.\n\nYeah, not comfortable.\n\nLefties have to buy special guitars. (Or they can make like Jimi Hendrix and just play a righty guitar upside down.)\n\nSource: Los Angeles Times\n\nVegetable peelers don't work for lefties, either \u2014 but this one takes a bit of explaining.\n\nVegetable peelers only have one sharp side. They're designed so that when they're held in the right hand, the sharp side is on top and users can comfortably pull the tool toward themselves in a smooth, gentle motion, as seen in the photo above.\n\nBut when the peeler is held in the left hand, the sharp side of the blade is on the bottom. This means lefties have to awkwardly push the peeler away from themselves, resulting in short, jerky, uncomfortable peeling motions.\n\nLuckily, lefties can purchase left-handed peelers that solve the problem.\n\nSome entrance doors are built to be opened by right-handed people.\n\nThe natural way to open a door is to reach across your body to grab the knob, and the default is usually to have the knob on the left-hand side. That means they're often built for righties to reach across their bodies with their dominant hand. Now, imagine reaching for a knob on the left side of the door with your left hand and pulling. Basically, you end up with the door in your face.\n\nThere's a bright side, though, because lefties get the advantage when they go through that same doorway from the other direction. On the other side of the door, the knob will be on the right, so it's meant to be grabbed with the left.\n\nEver notice that a camera's most important buttons are always on the right?\n\nEven capturing moments is tougher for left-handed people.\n\nWhen lefties draw a line along a ruler, their hands cover the numbers, so it's hard to see when to stop.\n\nOn left-handed rulers, the numbers move from right to left instead. That way, lefties can drag their pens from right to left and get a clear look at the numbers.\n\nWhen you hold a tape measure in your left hand, the numbers are upside down.", "description": "Steinhoff receives a record fine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9217/1cde6ca4ab8c46a0a9c81928535b7015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
