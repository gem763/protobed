Anytime something is said we are going to take it serious, and we are going to investigate it to the full extent and make an arrest, if possible, because we do not want any of our schools getting shot up. Nobody does. So, we are going to do everything we can to prevent this,\u201d Pittsburg County Sheriff Chris Morris said, WWNY reported.\n\n\u201cAuthorities say Wilson was expelled from the high school after violent incidents and that she had been suspended on separate occasions after being caught with a knife and a swastika at school. She wasn\u2019t allowed to re-enroll,\u201d The Associated Press reported.\n\nMs. Wilson reportedly dropped out of high school in ninth grade but was attempting to re-enroll to receive credits for her GED. She was reportedly angry when the school denied her the ability to re-enroll, but she said she wasn\u2019t mad, police said.\n\nShe also told police she was bullied while in school but learned to ignore it. She also admitted to having suicidal feelings.\n\nMcAlester Public School Superintendent Randy Hughes said while Ms. Wilson \u201chad some problems,\u201d she did not see anything that would result in \u201csomething like this,\u201d WWNY reported.\n\n\u201cI am saddened by the state of where we are at in our society. I am grateful to God for watching over us. I am grateful for our police department for acting swiftly and quickly. I am relieved. You always look at the other side and think what could have happened. We don\u2019t want any of our kids hurt,\u201d Mr. Hughes said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
