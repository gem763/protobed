That's because our bodies generally only absorb a small portion of the dose. The rest of the pill \u2014 up to 90% \u2014 is excreted, either into the toilet as waste or through sweat that gets washed down shower drains or washing machines.\n\nSometimes, people even choose to flush unused pills, sending a full dose down the toilet.\n\nThe hormones then travel to a wastewater plant, and from there, they can get discharged into nearby waterways such as rivers and lakes \u2014 some of which are used as sources of drinking water.\n\nThat means the prescriptions we take most often, like birth control, could eventually wind up in tap water in trace amounts. In his new book, \"Troubled Water,\" activist Seth Siegel says scientists don't yet understand the health effects of this potential contamination. But Siegel thinks all pharmaceutical compounds should be removed from our taps right away.\n\nIt's hard to tell how much estrogen from birth control winds up in our taps\n\nIn the US, around 15 million women regularly take birth-control pills, which typically rely on a synthetic form of estrogen known as EE2. Since it's an endocrine disruptor, EE2 can interfere with reproductive hormones and development if consumed in excess or by vulnerable individuals like infants.\n\nAccording to Siegel, birth-control pills add more than 10 million doses of synthetic estrogen to America's wastewater every day. That estimate is based the number of women who take oral contraceptives in the US, and assumes those women take the pill 21 days of the month and excrete around 90% of the dose into wastewater.\n\nVery little of that estrogen actually makes its way into our taps, since most water-treatment systems filter it out along with other contaminants. A 2010 study determined that birth-control pills account for less than 1% of the total amount of estrogen found in US drinking water. But since local water systems don't test for EE2, the study's authors noted, it's hard to say for sure how much of the hormone is in our water.\n\nMost of the estrogen in drinking water comes from other sources, such as livestock that excrete natural estrogen, which can travel through soil and into local groundwater.\n\nBut Siegel argues in his book that livestock can't solely be responsible for the estrogen in our wastewater, since other pharmaceutical compounds, like those used to make antidepressants, make it there as well.\n\n\"No one is giving a cow Zoloft,\" Siegel told Business Insider. \"The only possible source of that is through the wastewater. That's why it's so relevant, so scary.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean women should stop taking the pill\n\nSome water experts, Siegel said, abide by the adage that \"the solution to pollution is dilution.\" In other words, dumping water that contains pharmaceutical compounds into larger bodies of water dilutes the concentrations of hormones enough to minimize their threat to humans or the environment.\n\nBut Siegel said that even in the purest bodies of water, like the Great Lakes, scientists have found residues of antidepressants like Prozac in the bodies of local fish.\n\nIn the northeast, scientists have discovered that estrogen in rivers and lakes can cause male fish to develop female biomarkers like ovaries. Other studies have shown that exposure to EE2 has led fish to become less fertile across generations.\n\nScientists don't know if these findings have any implications for human health, but Diana Aga, a chemical-pollution expert at the State University of New York at Buffalo, told Siegel that it's possible for similar effects to crop up among \"more complex creatures.\"\n\n\"There's every reason to believe that estrogen and the pharmaceutical compounds that we're ingesting in micro-quantities are having an effect,\" Siegel said. \"Why wouldn't it be possible that a newborn or fetus, or a three-year-old getting an irregular dosage, might not see some effect on their brain function or brain development?\"\n\nThe solution, he said, isn't to stop making or taking medications. It's to make sure these compounds are deliberately removed at water-treatment plants.\n\n\"Pharmaceutical products have done great things for America's health. I am not saying that we should ban all these things,\" Siegel said. \"What I am saying is that we should get all the benefits of these products and also get pure drinking water. We can do both.\"", "description": "Hormones from birth-control pills travel through our showers, toilets, and washing machines to local wastewater facilities.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db0a8c8cc4a0a5c14327175?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
