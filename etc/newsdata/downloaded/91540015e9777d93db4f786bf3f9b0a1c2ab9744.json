Brett Kavanaugh tops Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The nine U.S. Supreme Court justices, including the newest justice, Brett Kavanaugh, gathered for their official group photo at the Supreme Court. (Nov. 30) AP\n\nIt didn't take long for Brett Kavanaugh to become the best known Supreme Court justice.\n\nAn extensive new poll of 1,423 adults by Marquette University Law School finds Kavanaugh, after one year as an associate justice, topping 86-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg in name recognition among the nine members of the court.\n\nUnfortunately for Kavanaugh, it's likely for the wrong reasons. His contentious, 50-48 Senate confirmation last October followed unproven accusations of sexual misconduct from his high school and college days. Ginsburg, on the other hand, has become a popular cultural icon, known for her distinctive dissenting collars.\n\nEighty-three percent of those polled said they have heard of Kavanaugh, compared to Ginsburg's 78%. By contrast, only two-thirds can identify John Roberts after 14 years as the nation's 17th chief justice. And nearly half of those polled have never heard of Associate Justices Stephen Breyer, who's served a quarter century, and Elena Kagan.\n\nNew Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, top right, towers over his colleagues in this photo and is better known, following his contentious Senate confirmation battle last year, according to a poll by Marquette University Law School.

Among those who say they know enough to rate him, he is favored by 25% and disfavored by only 9%. Ginsburg and Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor cast similarly favorable impressions, with Ginsburg viewed favorably, 41%-17% and Sotomayor 29%-11%.\n\nPoll:Majority of Americans lacks confidence in Trump when it comes to making Supreme Court picks\n\nKavanaugh is the only justice with a net unfavorable rating: He was favored by 26% but viewed negatively by 32%, with the remainder of those who could identify him having no opinion. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, who also faced misconduct allegations during his confirmation in 1991, was the closest with a 27%-23% favorable tilt.\n\nKavanaugh also is the most polarizing justice. Republicans favor him by a 12-to-1 ratio, while Democrats don't by almost 10 to 1. And while men are split evenly, women view him unfavorably by more than a 3-to-2 ratio.\n\nRoberts \u2013 who represents the new \"swing\" vote on the court following last year's retirement of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2013 is the only justice viewed favorably on the right and left. He is nearly as popular among Democrats (24%-11%) as he is among Republicans (30%-9%). His rating by Republicans is the weakest among the five conservative justices.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/brett-kavanaugh-ruth-bader-ginsburg-best-known-supreme-court/4044580002/", "description": "An extensive new poll of adults by Marquette University Law School finds Kavanaugh topping 86-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg in name recognition.", "authors": ["Richard Wolf", "Craig Gilbert", "Usa Today", "Published A.M.
