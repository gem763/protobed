Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs", "language": "en", "text": "The employee, whom city officials did not identify, has been placed on administrative leave.\n\nD.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said he had been told that the FBI visited the sprawling city agency responsible for housing code enforcement and occupational licensing.\n\n\u201cI heard they showed up, and my impression is it involves one employee,\u201d Mendelson said in an interview.\n\nFBI Washington Field Office spokeswoman Melanie Lowry would confirm only \u201ccourt-authorized law enforcement activity\u201d at the DCRA office. A D.C. police spokesman said city police were not involved.\n\nDCRA Director Ernest Chrappah did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and his spokesman referred questions to the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nIn recent years, federal officials have prosecuted DCRA employees in bribery cases. The agency plays a key role in development projects and businesses.\n\nThe DCRA has been under scrutiny for its failure to take action on an illegal rooming house where a man and a 9-year-old boy died in an Aug. 18 fire. A D.C. police officer reported dangerous conditions at the house on Kennedy Street NW to the DCRA in March.\n\nWashington journalist Tom Sherwood first reported news of the FBI appearance.\n\nSpencer S. Hsu contributed to this report.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The case was limited to one employee and did not involve agency operations, District officials said.", "authors": ["Fenit Nirappil", "Reporter Covering D.C.
