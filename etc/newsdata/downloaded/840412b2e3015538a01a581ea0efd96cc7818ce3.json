China reportedly ceased all streaming and discussion of the show on its state-controlled internet.\n\nApple is in the midst of developing its ambitious streaming platform, Apple TV+, which is already slated with highly-anticipated original content. The company relies on Chinese manufacturing for many of its products, and China makes up a great deal of its consumer base. Thus, sources told Bloomberg that it was unlikely that Apple would want to host \"South Park\" on Apple TV+.\n\nConversely, Apple also appears to be crafting a family-friendly content selection on its streaming service, with relatively non-controversial content in general.\n\nRead more: 'South Park' mocked LeBron James over his comments about China\n\nBloomberg also reports that as many as six streaming services are in the running to acquire \"South Park.\" The show has been available to stream on Hulu since 2015, and Hulu is interested in retaining the show as long as it does not become too expensive.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix has dropped out of negotiating for \"South Park,\" according to Bloomberg, but NBC's Peacock and HBO Max are both angling for the series.\n\nAfter \"South Park\" made fun of China's censorship of Western entertainment, resulting in its apparent ban, it posted a sarcastic \"apology\" that drew on the recent NBA-China clash over an NBA executive's endorsement of the Hong Kong protests. The show also mocked LeBron James for his comments on the incident in another episode and declared \"f--- the Chinese government.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Apple didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Sources familiar with the bid told Bloomberg that Apple probably doesn't want 'South Park' streaming rights because the show is banned in China.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dab3535cc4a0a2fd74f19d3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
