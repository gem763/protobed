The video has gathered over 80,000 views since it was posted last Friday.\n\nDan's two friends tried to explain his diagnosis to the waiters, Bryanna Hare wrote in the caption, but waitstaff asked for proof of his condition. Since Dan did not have any on him, Bryanna wrote that she had to bring her husband's medical binder to the restaurant, and that was when the recorded confrontation ensued.\n\nRead more: An activist dying from ALS told Congress that 'GoFundMe is a terrible substitute' for healthcare\n\n\"You do not treat someone like that who's handicapped,\" Bryanna could be heard saying in the video.\n\nThe couple had recently wed in May of this year, KYW-TV reported, and shortly after, Dan was diagnosed with ALS in August.\n\n\"It made me feel very helpless and almost, you know, like I didn't deserve to be out enjoying myself,\" Hare told KYW-TV of the encounter.\n\nThe restaurant's owner Vittoria Perez told KYW-TV that the Hares had overreacted to the situation, and that the waitstaff were acting cautiously to protect the restaurant if it did turn out that Dan Hare was intoxicated.\n\n\"They were very aggressive,\" Perez told KYW-TV. \"If anything happens, we're liable.
