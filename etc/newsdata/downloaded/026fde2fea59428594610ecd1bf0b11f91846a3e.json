He puts a good case that it is more appropriate to combine the rate of inflation with the labour underutilisation rate (13.5 per cent), rather than with the much lower unemployment rate (5.2 per cent), in order to derive a modern \u2018\u2018misery index\u2019\u2019. Mr Commins also reminds us that sitting alongside high labour underutilisation are \u201csky-high household debt, negligible wage growth and soft business investment\u201d. These are all symptoms of an economy suffering more misery than even his adjusted index reveals.\n\nHowever, our troubles will only deepen if we now blindly drift to kickstarting retail consumption after the anticipated rise in house prices. If we are to avoid GFC Mark II, we must stop fiddling with monetary policy and shift our focus to radical fiscal reform. Consumer price inflation in Australia has supposedly averaged about 2 per cent over the last decade, yet remarkably during that same period, average land prices have nearly doubled! Rising land prices have made it difficult for workers and investors to access sites to build homes or undertake other productive economic activities.\n\nThey have also fuelled debt levels, subdued capital investment, stifled wages growth and discouraged labour utilisation. We need to rein in rising land prices by collecting land values for public expenditure and abolishing taxation on labour and its products.\n\nRonald Johnson\n\nCharnwood, ACT\n\nInclude private sector in right to know reform\n\nThe Right to Know campaign would be much more credible and effective if it included a similar set of demands on the private sector (October 21).\n\nMore than 100 countries have enacted freedom of information legislation but exclude the private sector from their jurisdiction.\n\nThe reforms to freedom of information and related matters in regard to government are important and necessary. However, it is just as important to establish legal rights and protections in regard to private sector information, processes and decision making if we really want to develop a more open and transparent economy, society and culture.\n\nGovernment in confidence is unacceptable, but so also is business in confidence.\n\nStewart Sweeney\n\nNorth Adelaide, SA\n\nTruth the only option in a free country\n\n\u2018\u2018The truth is out there\u2019\u2019, but not seemingly in Australia given the Right to Know campaign.\n\nHow can a person face 161 years\u2019 jail for talking about the ATO? How can going through a journalist\u2019s sock drawer help Australia be a freer country? Why can\u2019t politicians actually answer a question with Yes or No?\n\nThere is something to reflect on in the words of George Orwell: \u2018\u2018In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\u2019\u2019 Telling the truth is surely the only option in a free country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDennis Fitzgerald\n\nBox Hill, Vic\n\nMake multinationals pay turnover tax\n\nGrant Wardell-Johnson\u2019s proposed solution to taxing multinational corporations is comical (October 21). There is no \u2018\u2018unified approach\u2019\u2019. Less than 1 per cent of the population would understand what he is on about, yet he calls for public input?\n\nThe author does get one fact right: \u2018\u2018The failure to find a global solution is becoming a real problem.\u2019\u2019 He punts on the complex OECD proposals being successful \u2013 \u2018\u2018maybe a 60 to 80 per cent chance\u2019\u2019. I believe there is no chance.\n\nThe best tax is a simple tax. Australia needs to correct the annual leakage of hundreds of millions of taxation revenue dollars. All that is required is the application of easily determined benchmark turnover taxes to the Australian-generated revenues of multinational corporations. Tax is collected upfront with GST and years of tax disputes and litigation are avoided. All sensible, fair and equitable.\n\nGraeme Troy\n\nWagstaffe, NSW\n\nOust product providers from advice business\n\nChanticleer asks a good question in \u2018\u2018Regulators hold key to filling advice gap\u2019\u2019 (October 21) \u2013 What do we want advice to look like in five years\u2019 time?\n\nOur biggest hope for 2024 has to be that AMP, IOOF, industry funds and other manufacturers of financial products are regulated out and no longer allowed admission to the advice club.\n\nNone of these organisations have ever made a cent of profit from provision of advice. They have made billions from the provision of financial products masquerading their recommendations as advice.\n\n\u25a0Advice is impartial, always being in the client\u2019s best interests without any perceived or real conflict present.\n\n\u25a0Advice has to be valuable enough by itself.\n\n\u25a0Advice is not something anyone can be bound to without consent.\n\n\u25a0Advice is paid for in clear amounts, not hidden.\n\nFinancial advice will never be valued or trusted if it continues to be controlled by the product providers.\n\nWhile the manufacturers play a crucial role in the development of world-class product, they must be regulated out to allow the market of true advisers, accountants and others to grow as their clients prosper from true advice.\n\nJim Stackpool, managing director, Certainty Advice Group", "description": "Land prices, Right to Know campaign, multinational tax reform, financial advice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2399%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_71%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/026cba751b86fe6cbb1a6e83a8cd62ac4db7aa59", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
