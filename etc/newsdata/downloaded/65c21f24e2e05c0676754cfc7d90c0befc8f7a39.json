An indefinite curfew imposed by authorities in the capital, as well as an internet blackout, also failed to prevent protesters from gathering.\n\nAccording to Reuters, security forces were seen firing live rounds at protesters trying to reach Tahrir Square in the capital Baghdad - where much of the unrest has been focused.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Authorities have shut down the internet and imposed a curfew to try to quell the unrest\n\nA Reuters reporter on the ground said several people had been hit by bullets, some in the head and others in the stomach.\n\nAt least 10 people were killed there on Friday alone, according to medical and security sources.\n\nThis is said to include the four Iraqis - two civilians and two officers - shot by sniper fire in central Baghdad, according to security forces.\n\nAt least 60 people have died, including six members of Iraqi security forces. Hundreds more have been wounded.\n\nMuch of the violence has been concentrated in Baghdad and majority Shia Muslim areas in the south, including Amara, Diwaniya and Hilla. A number of deaths were reported on Friday in the southern city of Nasiriya, about 320km (200 miles) away.\n\nWhat's been the reaction?\n\nIn his first speech since unrest began, Prime Minister Mahdi vowed early on Friday to respond to protesters' concerns but warned there was no \"magic solution\" to Iraq's problems.\n\nHe said he had given his full backing to security forces, insisting they were abiding by \"international standards\" in dealing with protesters.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Reuters reporters on the ground witnessed protesters being shot by live fire on Friday\n\nIraq's most senior Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, urged the government to respond to the demands for reform, saying it has \"not answered the demands of the people to fight corruption or achieved anything on the ground\".\n\nMeanwhile, Moqtada Sadr - another highly influential Shia cleric who leads the largest opposition bloc in parliament - demanded the Iraqi government resign and call snap elections.\n\nMr Sadr also instructed his lawmakers to pull out of parliament, until the government devises a programme acceptable to the wider public.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Iraqi anti-government protesters defy an open-ended curfew\n\nThe UN and US have expressed concern over the violence, and urged the Iraqi authorities to exercise restraint.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has also appealed for the security forces to be reined in.\n\nRead more from Iraq:\n\nWhy is this happening now?\n\nCorruption, unemployment and poor public services are at the heart of the discontent faced by young Iraqis today. The unrest began spontaneously with no formal leadership in mostly Shia areas in the south, and quickly spread.\n\nIraq has the fourth-largest reserves of oil, but 22.5% of its population of 40 million were living on less than $1.90 (\u00a31.53) a day in 2014, according to the World Bank. One in six households has experienced some form of food insecurity.\n\nThe unemployment rate was 7.9% last year, but among young people it was double that. And almost 17% of the economically active population is underemployed.\n\nUnemployment in Iraq Modelled ILO estimates, %\n\nThe country is also struggling to recover after a brutal war against the Islamic State group, which seized control of large swathes of the north and west in 2014.\n\nLiving conditions remain dire in many conflict-affected areas, with insufficient services.", "description": "More than 60 people have been killed in four days of anti-government protests across the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17C6E/production/_109109379_4682e2ac-87b5-4081-af4e-3433fda3aba9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
