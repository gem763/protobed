Schiff claimed that Trump told Zelensky, \"I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it, on this and on that, I\u2019m going to put you in touch with people.\"\n\nWhen a few Republicans on the panel noted those words were not in the transcript, Schiff clarified that his summary was meant as \"parody.\" That explanation didn't exactly appease them, and it only gave more opportunity to Republicans like Rep. Elise Stefanik (NY) to mock him.\n\nToday\u2019s @HouseIntel hearing with Acting DNI Maguire is extremely important for Americans to hear. I focused on the whistleblower complaint itself & did not recklessly improvise a fake dialogue for parody purposes like Adam Schiff\u2014the head of this committee\u2014did. Watch part 1 ?? pic.twitter.com/5MBeV7XNCd \u2014 Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) September 26, 2019\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Biggs took a different route. On Twitter he revealed that he has introduced a motion to censure Schiff (say that five times fast) for his improvised reading of the transcript.\n\nToday, I introduced a motion to condemn and censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Chairman Schiff\u2019s blatantly false retelling of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky was inexcusable. pic.twitter.com/yhwQuBvp3G \u2014 Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) September 27, 2019\n\nSchiff read a statement that was \"blatantly false,\" Biggs says in the video, calling it \"inexcusable.\"\n\nTrump did one better. He told Schiff to resign.\n\nThe California lawmaker says it's Trump who should leave.\n\nThe consensus of national security experts is clear: President Trump\u2019s actions concerning Ukraine endanger America's security.\n\n\n\nBy subjugating the national interest to his own political interest, Trump has shown he is incapable and unwilling to fulfill his oath of office. https://t.co/8NttxkhDl2 \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 27, 2019\n\nThe released transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky did not include evidence of quid pro quo and, in the whistleblower complaint the complainant admits not being directly privy to their conversation. Yet, Democrats have used the phone call to launch an official impeachment inquiry.", "description": ".09/27/2019 20:53:57PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/3bbe62de-7a45-453d-844e-7d8a20ffc26b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
