The United States is expected to sell some $78 billion worth of notes and bonds this week.\n\nIn addition, Greece could reopen its 10-year bond, analysts said. On Monday, Greece said it had appointed banks to reopen an outstanding debt issue due March 2029.\n\nA banker on the deal said that it made sense for Greece to add to the original bond, which had a relatively small size, rather than consider issuing a new longer-dated issue.\n\nAthens is taking advantage of record low yields in the euro zone to beef up cash reserves and add liquidity to its shallow bond market.\n\nItaly, meanwhile, was also in focus amid expectations that it is poised to issue a dollar bond.\n\nItaly has mandated Barclays, HSBC and JPMorgan for a multi-tranche, U.S. dollar bond issue, Refinitiv's IFR service reported on Monday.
