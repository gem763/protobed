After a two-and-a-half year investigation, Mueller concluded no collusion and no obstruction took place.\n\nFrom The Guardian:\n\nThe Mueller investigation began after Australia\u2019s former foreign minister Alexander Downer was allegedly told about the interference by George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign aide. Downer then informed the FBI. According to Downer, Papadopoulos told him during \u201ca night of heavy drinking\u201d in May 2016 that Russia had obtained damaging information about Hillary Clinton from her emails.\n\nPapadopoulos took to Twitter to chime in on the letter:\n\nI have been right about Downer from the beginning. A wannabe spy and Clinton errand boy who is about to get exposed on the world stage. Great reporting, NYTs!
