Gavin Newsom (D) signed a bill into law Wednesday that will allow those who say they were sexually assaulted by former University of Southern California gynecologist George Tyndall more time to seek damages against him.\n\nState Assemblymember Eloise G\u00f3mez Reyes (D) introduced the bill, AB 1510, last month in response to the nearly 400 women who have accused Tyndall of sexually assaulting them as his patients at USC\u2019s campus clinic.\n\nIn July, Tyndall, 72, pleaded not guilty to charges of molesting 16 patients at the clinic where he worked for 27 years until he quietly resigned in 2017, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nDespite the hundreds of women that have come forward, many of them were unable to sue Tyndall for damages from the alleged assault because they had missed the deadline to file a civil lawsuit.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s statute of limitations requires victims of sexual assault to take civil action within 10 years from the date of the act, or within three years from the date the victim discovers they were assaulted.\n\nSome of the accusations against Tyndall date to the 1990s, the Times reported. The allegations include inappropriate photos and medically unnecessary groping and touching.\n\n\u201cWe know from extensive media accounts and testimony in legislative committees that many survivors of Dr. Tyndall were ignored when they initially raised concerns about what they had experienced,\u201d Reyes said when AB 1510 passed the state Legislature.\n\n\u201cSurvivors of sexual assault should never have their rights diminished or be denied their day in court because of delays and cover-ups by the very institutions that enabled the sexual assault to occur,\u201d Reyes added.\n\nThe new law gives Tyndall\u2019s accusers a one-year window to file civil actions against the former gynecologist.\n\nThe law applies only to claims of damages of more than $250,000 that stem from sexual assault or harassment by a \u201cphysician occurring at a student health center between Jan. 1, 1998, and Jan. 1, 2017,\u201d according to the bill.\n\nTyndall, who has surrendered his medical license, has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of sexual assault and 11 counts of sexual battery in Los Angeles County.", "description": "Hundreds of women accused George Tyndall of sexual assault, but the state's statute of limitations may have prevented their damage claims.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d955174210000a80251ba8f.jpeg?cache=l5g7th3nag&ops=1778_1000"}
