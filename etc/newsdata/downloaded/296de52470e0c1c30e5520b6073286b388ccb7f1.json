The Fijians were supposed to be causing the upsets in this group, but they were trumped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of my country. We\u2019re not the biggest, we\u2019re not the tallest, but we came here to win,\u201d Gaminara said in his post-game TV interview, choking back tears and taking deep breaths to compose himself. \u201cWe never had anything granted. You saw the passion.\u201d\n\nUruguay won their only previous Rugby World Cup game against Georgia, in 2003, but the Georgians have won the last three meetings.\n\nUruguay coach Esteban Meneses made just two changes to his forward pack in a bid to meet the Georgian strength, with Juan Pedro Rombys replacing Diego Arbelo at tighthead and Alejandro Nieto starting at No. 8 at the expense of Manuel Diana.\n\nThe Fijians scored five tries to three but the boot of Felipe Berchesi, who scored a Uruguayan record 15 points in the game, was the difference in that game. Berchesi will direct the attack again.\n\nWinger Giorgi Kveseladze, flyhalf Tedo Abzhandadze and lock Konstantine Mikautadze were the only Georgian players retained in the starting XV after the loss to Wales.\n\nVeteran hooker Jaba Bregvadze, who was yellow-carded after going on as a replacement against Wales, will lead Georgia for the first time. He plays for the Sunwolves, the Japan-based Super Rugby club, and should get a lot of crowd support.\n\nHe\u2019s in charge because of a hectic timetable that makes it important for Georgia to rotate players.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s a tough schedule for us to play three games in 10 days,\u201d assistant coach Levan Maisashvili said. \u201cSome players played big minutes (against Wales) and we have to give a rest to some of them. We have 31 players and all of them are waiting for their opportunity.\u201d\n\nKeeping some seasoned test veterans out of the squad gave younger players a chance, he said, but Georgia would be taking nothing for granted.\n\n\u201cUruguay showed us that they will fight for everything \u2026 in every single area of the field,\u201d Maisashvili said. \u201cWe are waiting for them to do that. Uruguay are a team who can play with heart, as well as us, so I think it will be a good game.\u201d\n\nLock Lasha Lomidze said Uruguay\u2019s win over Fiji had changed some perceptions about the group.\n\n\u201cEverybody says that we should win this game, but we should consider that Uruguay has beaten Fiji and that was a surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a great example for us for future matches but, in this game, we need to make sure that the only side creating a surprise will be Georgia.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nGeorgia: Lasha Khmaladze, Zura Dzneladze, Giorgi Kveseladze, Lasha Malaguradze, Alexander Todua, Tedo Abzhandadze, Gela Aprasidze; Otari Giorgadze, Beka Saginadze, Shalva Sutiashvili, Konstantine Mikautadze, Lasha Lomidze, Levan Chilachava, Jaba Bregvadze (captain), Guram Gogichashvili.
