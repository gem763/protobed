He was recently named MVP of the BIG3 3-on-3 basketball league.\n\nJohnson averaged 6.8 points in 55 games for Houston and Utah during two seasons ago. The seven-time All-Star has also played for Boston, Phoenix, Atlanta, Brooklyn and Miami, averaging 16 points over his career with 15 double-digit scoring seasons.\n\nThe Pistons previously signed 30-year-old guard Derrick Rose, a former NBA MVP, and 30-year-old forward Markieff Morris this offseason. They are shooting to make the playoffs in consecutive years for the first time since earning a spot in eight straight postseasons from 2002 to 2009.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Detroit Pistons have signed 38-year-old swingman Joe Johnson.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
