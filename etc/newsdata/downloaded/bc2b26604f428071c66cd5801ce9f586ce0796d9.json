The first, decarbonisation, was proceeding apace in Australia with the world-leading rise of renewables, although the \"e-mobility\" trend was moving slower.\n\nOn the second, digitalisation, there was \"probably more work to do\", he said in terms of using sensors to collect data that can help predict failures in parts of the network and increase the reliability of the grid as it shift towards intermittent wind and solar power.\n\n\"We are seeing developments in Australia but I think that digitalisation can definitely be pushed even more in this market, both in terms of digitalising substations as well as in terms of adding software which can make the network more stable and more capable,\" Mr Danieli said.", "description": "Executives at engineering firm ABB say long-distance cables can support bold plans backed by Mike Cannon-Brookes to export clean energy to Asia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3163%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_330%2C$y_103/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4fc6435f239dbad1ebfdf37c42a2534cd0e848d5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
