It resolves only to be irresolute, decides only to be undecided, determined to dither, adamant to drift.\"\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the government a \"disgrace\" for its decision to prorogue parliament and said: \"I hope the prime minister will reflect on the issue of prorogation and trying to avoid a government being held to account because that is exactly what he has done today and proposes to do to this country.\"\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson ordered to publish secret no-deal Brexit plans to suspend parliament\n\nWhy does Johnson want an election?\n\nBritain's PM Boris Johnson leaves Downing Street from the rear entrance door, in London Reuters\n\nJohnson has sought an election since last week because he insisted a move by MPs to block a no-deal Brexit on October 31 had wrecked his negotiation position with the EU and left him with no choice but to go to the polls.\n\nOpposition MPs, along with a handful of Conservative rebels, last week approved a law which would force Johnson to request a three-month delay to Brexit if he was unable to secure a deal with the EU by October 18.\n\nBut Labour and other opposition parties failed to support Johnson's subsequent attempt to force an early general election, which under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act must be approved by two-thirds of the House.\n\nLabour's leadership favours a general election but has been wary of agreeing to one at Johnson's time of choosing.\n\nThe party now believes that Johnson will suffer dramatically in the polls if he is forced to seek a delay and break his \"do-or-die\" pledge to leave the EU on October 31.", "description": "The UK Parliament rejects Boris Johnson's request for a general election for a second time as it heads for a six-week shutdown.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d76db272e22af39366c6703-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
