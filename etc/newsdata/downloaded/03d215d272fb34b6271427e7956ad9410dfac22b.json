It will soon be eclipsed, however, by another supertall, Dubai Creek Tower, an architectural observation deck on track to be completed ahead of Expo 2020. The greater Dubai Creek Harbour development will also unveil the world\u2019s largest shopping mall, Dubai Square (with 104 soccer fields\u2019 worth of leasable space), in time for the expo.\n\nThe expo will arrive following a decade of frenzied development that has resulted in myriad large-scale residential projects. The popular Palm Jumeirah is the world\u2019s largest artificial island, completed in the late aughts in the shape of a palm tree and featuring hundreds of lavish villas as well as several high-end apartment blocks.\n\nDevelopers have also transformed swaths of barren desert into verdant villa communities complete with artificial rivers, golf clubs and equestrian facilities.\n\nBut the stream of new construction has come at a cost. Supply has inundated the marketplace and is the primary cause of the city\u2019s housing woes. Developers completed roughly 30,000 new homes in 2018, double the average annual total for previous years, according to data from Property Finder, a Dubai-based listing site. That exponential growth has continued into this year, as around 40,000 new units\u2014villas, townhouses and apartments\u2014are on track to be completed by the end of 2019. As a result, fierce competition among sellers has driven home prices down 25% to 30% from their 2014 peak.\n\nWhile years of price deflation means many homeowners are selling at a loss, Dubai now presents a clear upside for buyers, especially those who couldn\u2019t afford to buy several years ago, said Aron Lomax, managing partner of luxury agency Treo Homes.\n\n\u201cThe expo is coming at a really interesting time because right now Dubai is probably the best value in the world in terms of price per square foot and in terms of city,\u201d Mr. Lomax said. \u201cAs I like to say: Dubai is on sale.\u201d\n\nFor instance, the average price per square foot for the city\u2019s priciest neighborhood, Downtown-Burj Khalifa, was AED 1,926, the equivalent of US$525, in the third quarter, according to data from Dubai-based property consultants Cavendish Maxwell. By comparison, the average square foot for a luxury home in Manhattan, New York, cost five times that in the third quarter, according to the latest market report from New York-based firm Miller Samuel.\n\nIndeed, homes in some of the city\u2019s most exclusive villa communities are offering major discounts compared to five years ago. The Emirates Living mega-development, which includes the uber-posh Emirates Hills golf community\u2014home to foreign dignitaries and company executives\u2014has seen its average sale price plummet nearly 30% compared to 2014, according to custom data provided by Cavendish Maxwell.", "description": "The six-month world\u2019s fair, the first ever in the Middle East, is expected to draw visitors, transplants and investors alike", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-119437?size=1.8285714285714285&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
