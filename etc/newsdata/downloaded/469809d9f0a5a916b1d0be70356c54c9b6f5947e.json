I don't blame her one bit, she is so unprepared for this.'\n\nRosie, 30, from Bradford, was left devastated on last night's Don't Tell The Bride after her boyfriend Jake, 26, arranged for her to sleep in a tent the night before her festival wedding\n\nThe groom organised to marry his bride in a quick 15 minute ceremony on stage at Wickham Festival in front of 7,000 strangers\n\nViewers of the Channel 4 programme were left shocked by Jake's behaviour, with some calling him the 'worst groom ever'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Worst groom (to be) ever!'\n\nRosie admitted she had concerns from the outset, saying: 'His proposal wasn't even a proposal.\n\n'He didn't even propose with a ring. I didn't even get a ring till months later.'\n\nMeanwhile Jake revealed: 'I'm not selfish, but I can see how some stuff I've done can come across like that.'\n\nRosie said she wanted an intimate family affair in a rustic barn, while party-boy Jake revealed he was planning a festival wedding\n\nHe admitted his friends were 'a bit wild' and said: 'The wedding could potentially turn into a lad's holiday, if I'm honest.'\n\nAnd while Rosie said her nightmare wedding would be just a massive party, Jake admitted he wanted the wedding to be a festival.\n\nHe also told how he wanted 'high-maintenance' Rosie to sleep in a tent the night before the wedding.\n\nHe said: 'She can get quite insecure about the way she looks.\n\nThe groom admitted his plans for a wedding day at Wickham Festival might turn into a huge 'lad's holiday'\n\n'I tell her how beautiful she is all the time, how she doesn't need all this stuff.'\n\nHe added: 'But if I take that out of her control, she's going to have to get married anyway. She'll say she looks \"rough\", but to me she'd still look beautiful.'\n\nDespite Jake's seemingly romantic gesture, even the best man admitted he was unsure about the idea, saying: 'Rosie is going to be flying out of that tent, kicking off big time.'\n\nBut a determined Jake continued with his planning, and organised to have a quick wedding ceremony on stage at Wickham Festival, where they'd be watched by 7,000 strangers.\n\nIn order to keep Rosie in the dark about his wedding plans, Jake planned to sabotage the first hen do and 'throw a second one' - which would later be revealed to be the wedding\n\nRosie was left fuming over the first hen do, which saw her going to a local pub where there was \u00a350 behind the bar\n\nAnd the groom also had a plan in order to trick the bride into arriving at the festival.\n\nHe planned to sabotage the hen do, so that he could then trick Rosie into thinking she was having a second hen do - but then reveal it was actually her wedding.\n\nRosie was fuming about her awful hen do, which saw her going to the local pub with \u00a350 behind the bar, saying: 'Tell Jake I'm not seeing him again.'\n\nShe said she hoped the hen do would be the end of her troubles, saying: 'Now they know that they did upset me last night, I'd like to know that they won't put me like anything like that again.'\n\nRosie was overjoyed to arrive at the festival, believing it was her hen do and not knowing it was actually her wedding\n\nSo she was initially overly excited when she was 'treated' to a second hen do at the festival.\n\nBut as it became clear that she wouldn't be leaving the festival ahead of the wedding, she was left devastated and confused.\n\nShe said: 'I'm not starting my wedding day in a tent...they wouldn't do that. The showers are rubbish - what are we going to do?'\n\nAnd while she stayed in a tent with her bridesmaid and mother, Jake was in a plush hotel enjoying a bottle of champagne with his friends.\n\nRosie and her bridesmaids stayed in a tent in the run up to the wedding, with the bride admitting she was devastated\n\nOn discovering she would not be leaving the festival on her wedding morning in order to have a shower and get ready, Rosie burst into tears\n\nShe said: 'We all hope we're leaving right now. No one wants to get another shower here. Everybody's morale is very low right now.'\n\nAnother bridesmaid called Jake's behavious 'abuse' saying: 'He's put her through hell.'\n\nAnd when they learned they wouldn't be leaving the festival site in order to get ready, Rosie was distraught.\n\nShe revealed that she hadn't even had a shower, and refused to have 'festival make- up' that Jake had organised for her.\n\nBut despite sleeping in a tent and not having had a shower on her wedding morning, Rosie's spirits turned around as she walked 'down the aisle'\n\nRosie told Jake he had put her through hell, but the couple ended up getting married at the festival anyway\n\nBreaking down in tears, she said: 'it's my f***** wedding day man. I'm not alright. Are you joking me?'\n\nShe moaned: 'I don't want to see him. I'm not getting ready. I wanted to be excited and enjoy the morning and I'm still sat in a tent.'\n\nBut with the help of the bridesmaids, she ended up getting ready and joining Jake on stage for a quick fifteen-minute ceremony in front of thousands of strangers.\n\nViewers said they were shocked by Jake's behaviour, with one saying: 'So he stays in a swanky hotel night before the wedding whilst she has to stay in a tent and get married at a festival the next day. I'd absolutely murder him!''\n\nViewers were stunned by Jake's behaviour, with some calling it 'the roughest episode' of Don't Tell The Bride\n\nAnother wrote: 'This is one of the roughest #Donttellthebride episodes I've watched so far. Groom in a hotel, bride in a tent on the morning of their wedding! Rough!'\n\nOne added: 'So Jake wants his bride to be married in a field, looking rough after a night in a tent, even though it could rain...ok then.'\n\nAnother commented: 'He does appear to be overly clueless and selfish, which begs the question, why is she marrying him in the first place?'", "description": "Don't Tell The Bride viewers were left stunned when Jake, 26, from Bradford, organised his wedding to Rosie, 30, at a  festival, and left her to sleep in a tent in a muddy field the night before.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/09/19982180-0-image-a-38_1571647151742.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
