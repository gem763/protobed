(AP) - Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Jordan Phillips found another opening to beat Taylor Lewan - this time on social media.\n\nThe Titans\u2019 three-time Pro Bowl left tackle gave a shout-out Monday on Twitter to Bills defensive end Shaq Lawson for his production as a first-round pick with a screen shot of Lawson\u2019s stats through Sunday\u2019s 14-7 win by Buffalo. Lawson had no tackles or sacks in the game.\n\nPhillips, who had a career-high three sacks by halftime, took over.\n\nThe defensive tackle wrote that Lewan should get drug tested again and called him a \u201csoft cry baby.\u201d Phillips then shared a couple of videos of Lawson tying up Lewan so he could get his second sack followed by a tweet with a screen grab of a story for Lewan failing a drug test earlier this year with \u201cPeople don\u2019t forget @taylorlewan77.\u201d\n\nThen the Bills lineman, who played the Titans and Lewan twice last season first with the Dolphins and then Buffalo, tweeted out a screen grab of the Titans left tackle unconscious in the 2018 season opener at Miami with the hashtag \u201cNSFW\u201d to Lewan. The Titans tackle missed the next game with a concussion.\n\nPhillips said after the Bills\u2018 win that he was really happy Lewan returned from his four-game suspension against Buffalo and that he could be a part of the Bills piling up five sacks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say about him,\u201d Phillips said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Jordan Phillips found another opening to beat Taylor Lewan - this time on social media.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/bills_titans_football_95915_c0-193-4608-2879_s1770x1032.jpg?8e79743f6a9fc69092ea9dd62d10cacd72986aa5", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
