Jared Huffman\u2019s bill repealing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge oil and gas program, we stepped up to the plate to fight it tooth and nail. The local tribe of Kaktovik even derided Mr. Huffman as they have fought for decades to open responsible production in ANWR.\n\nThe Western Caucus has sounded the alarm on the importance of including uranium on the United States\u2019 list of critical minerals. Not only is uranium essential to our national security and defense apparatus, it is also integral to our energy security.\n\nWorking in tandem with the Trump administration, we have rolled back Obama-era job-killing regulations and continue to work tirelessly to unleash American energy dominance.\n\nDespite all the work we have accomplished, extremists are continuing to undermine these important projects at hearings by inserting political riders into appropriations bills to defund many of these important initiatives.\n\nFortunately, the Western Caucus has a different vision for America. A vision that doesn\u2019t pick winners and losers and includes a true all-of-the-above energy strategy that embraces wind, solar, nuclear, hydropower, coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nOur vision encourages innovation and less burdensome mandates. We know responsible energy production and protecting our environment are not mutually exclusive goals.\n\nWe are experiencing an energy renaissance in this America. It\u2019s a story of freedom, prosperity and opportunity. For the first time in 65 years, the United States is a net exporter of energy. We are no longer dependent on volatile foreign sources produced in Russia and Saudi Arabia, and American homes and vehicles are being powered by American energy.\n\nRecent innovation and technology improvements associated with fracking and horizontal drilling have allowed shale resources previously deemed uneconomical to be developed and are the main reason the U.S. was the world leader in carbon emissions reductions in 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\nIt is such an honor to lead the Western Caucus and represent the people of Arizona\u2019s 4th Congressional District. We will continue to fight day in and day out for American energy dominance, and we will protect our environment along the way.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, D.D.S., Arizona Republican, is the Ranking Member on the House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources and serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. He is also Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
