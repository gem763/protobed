It coincided with an offensive by Turkey in northeast Syria against U.S.-allied Kurds.\n\nThe officials said U.S. troops were in the outpost at the time, but there had been no further activity since. U.S. forces have had a successful partnership with Kurdish YPG militia in Syria to oust the Islamic State group.\n\nOne of the U.S. officials said the explosion occurred several hundred meters from the base where U.S. special forces were located and the initial belief is that Turkey was responsible because Turkish artillery was pointed in the general direction of the U.S. outpost.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defense Ministry said there was no firing on the U.S. observation post.\n\n\u201cThere was no firing on the U.S. observation post,\u201d it said, adding that it fired in response to an attack on its military posts south of the town of Suruc, across the border from Kobane.\n\nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told reporters at the Pentagon earlier on Friday that Turkey had been told of U.S. positions in Syria, \u201cdown to explicit grid coordinate detail.\u201d\n\nTop Pentagon officials stressed the need for Turkey to avoid doing anything to endanger U.S. forces inside Syria, which numbered about 1,000 before the incursion. Although U.S. troops had no intention of firing on Turkey, a NATO ally, the Pentagon noted they had the right to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cEveryone is fully aware that we are the United States military. We retain the right of self-defense,\u201d Milley said.", "description": "An explosion that may have been caused by Turkish artillery struck near a U.S. military outpost in northern Syria on Friday, but no U.S. personnel were reported hurt, U.S. officials said, an incident that highlights the risks to U.S. troops as Turkey wages an offensive in the region.", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
