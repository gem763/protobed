(Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros. Pictures/AP)\n\nSince debuting at the Venice International Film Festival earlier this month, \u201cJoker,\u201d an R-rated supervillain origin story, has drawn both rave reviews and concerns over its realistic portrayal of a character sliding into a psychosis that leads him to kill.\n\nThe film\u2019s director, though, fiercely defended his film in a newly published interview, arguing that those worries are little more than the complaints of people looking for something to be angry about.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because outrage is a commodity, I think it\u2019s something that has been a commodity for a while,\u201d director Todd Phillips told the Wrap in a Sept. 20 interview first published Wednesday. \u201cWhat\u2019s outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It\u2019s really been eye-opening for me.\u201d\n\n[Families of Aurora shooting victims express concerns over \u2018Joker\u2019 in letter to Warner Bros.]\n\nThough the film won the top prize in Venice and has been well reviewed before its Oct. 4 release in the United States, it has also stirred fears of gun violence and criticisms that the film glorifies the bloody action at the center of its plot. Some of that uproar has emerged after Phillips originally spoke to the Wrap.\n\nThis week, the families of those killed in a mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater in 2012 asked Warner Bros. to donate proceeds to groups supporting victims and urged Congress to pass bipartisan gun-control legislation. The theater in Aurora where the massacre took place during a screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d is refusing to show \u201cJoker,\u201d a manager told The Washington Post.\n\nOn Sept. 18, a U.S. Army base in Oklahoma warned its service members that online threats had been made to target an unspecified theater during the \u201cJoker\u201d release, Christopher Grey, an Army Criminal Investigation Command spokesman, told The Post in a statement. A second memo sent Monday reiterated the concerns. The Army spokesman said there is no \u201cspecific, credible threat\u201d but added the warnings were shared \u201cout of an abundance of caution to help keep our Soldiers and their families safe.\u201d\n\nAlthough reviews have been largely positive, with a 75 percent \u201cfresh\u201d rating on Rotten Tomatoes to date, some critics have raised concerns that the movie could inspire violence from radicalized men clamoring for a moment of recognition \u2014 a description not unlike how many reviewers have characterized Arthur Fleck, the failing comic and for-hire clown who eventually becomes the Joker.\n\n\u201cHe could easily be adopted as the patron saint of incels,\u201d Time magazine critic Stephanie Zacharek, wrote, referring to an online community of men who espouse violently misogynist views and share anti-feminist hate online. \u201cArthur inspires chaos and anarchy, but the movie makes it look like he\u2019s starting a revolution, where the rich are taken down, the poor get everything they need and deserve, and the sad guys who can\u2019t get a date become killer heroes.\"\n\nIn the newly published interview, Phillips pushes back on those critiques, arguing he\u2019s making art, which can be controversial. The director, best known for comedies such as \u201cOld School\u201d and \u201cThe Hangover\u201d trilogy and the darker \u201cWar Dogs,\u201d which portrays the near-true story of two Miami stoners turned gunrunners.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it good to have these discussions about these movies, about violence?\u201d he said in an interview with the Wrap. \u201cWhy is that a bad thing if the movie does lead to a discourse about it?\u201d\n\nThe director also saw \u201cJoker\u201d as a chance to make a gritty and serious film with the kind of massive Hollywood budget usually reserved for franchises. \u201cJoker,\u201d which reportedly borrows its style and substance from films like \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cThe King of Comedy,\u201d takes the superhero film formula and runs it through a dark filter.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make the movie to push buttons,\u201d Phillips told the Wrap. \u201cI literally described to Joaquin [Phoenix] at one point in those three months as like, 'Look at this as a way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t, \u2018We want to glorify this behavior.\u2019 It was literally like, \u2018Let\u2019s make a real movie with a real budget and we\u2019ll call it [expletive] Joker\u2019. That\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\nThe movie\u2019s lead actor, Phoenix, has also been rankled at allegations that the film could be dangerous. He walked out of an interview with the Telegraph last week when a reporter asked him about criticisms of the film\u2019s tone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the filmmaker\u2019s responsibility to teach morality,\u201d Phoenix later told the Associated Press. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t know the difference between right and wrong, then there\u2019s all sorts of things that you are going to interpret in the way that you want.\u201d\n\nPhillips told IGN in another interview that his movie aims to capture the human suffering behind the Joker\u2019s descent into madness. \u201cThe movie makes statements about a lack of love, childhood trauma, lack of compassion in the world,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI think people can handle that message.\u201d\n\nWarner Bros., meanwhile, has responded to critics by noting its advocacy for reducing gun violence.\n\n\u201cGun violence in our society is a critical issue, and we extend our deepest sympathy to all victims and families impacted by these tragedies,\u201d Warner Bros. said in a statement provided to The Post. \u201cOur company has a long history of donating to victims of violence, including Aurora, and in recent weeks, our parent company joined other business leaders to call on policymakers to enact bi-partisan legislation to address this epidemic.\"\n\nThe studio also disputed claims that \u201cJoker\u201d would stoke violence.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind,\u201d the studio said. \u201cIt is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\u201d", "description": "\u201cJoker\u201d director Todd Phillips compared criticism of gun violence in his new film to far-right extremism in an interview published Wednesday afternoon.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
