Today, the bulk of this community, descendants of African slaves and native Americans, resides only on the low-lying fringes of South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nHurricane Dorian, which lacerated the Caribbean in early September, uprooted trees and left debris strewn across historic Gullah Geechee sites, according to Queen Quet, the elected chieftess and head of state for the community, which declared its own nationhood in 2000. A destructive recent pattern, marked most severely by Hurricane Matthew in 2016, is taking hold.\n\n\u201cThe biggest concern is the massive number of [storms] that are arriving on our coast annually,\u201d said Queen Quet, also known as Marquetta L Goodwine, who is also a computer scientist and historian. In the English-based creole language used by the Gullah Geechee, she is known as the \u201chead pun de boddee\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that this is directly linked to climate change dynamics,\u201d she said. \u201cThere have never been this many hurricanes and tropical storms in succession. This is causing a major strain on the community being able to recover financially from these.\u201d\n\nA rapidly warming ocean and atmosphere is helping fuel stronger, if not more numerous, hurricanes, climate scientists have found. But periods of drought and rising sea levels are also a major concern for the Gullah Geechee, owing to their precarious perch on a string of tidal and barrier islands called the Sea Islands, previously the site of rice, cotton and indigo plantations.\n\n\u201cThe very existence of the Gullah Geechee nation is threatened by the rapid erosion of our Sea Islands due to the sea level rise issues brought on by climate change,\u201d said Queen Quet, who has attempted to rouse the US government and the United Nations to the cause of a culture expressed through its arts, basket weaving and spiritual music, much of it based upon an intrinsic link to the sea.\n\nBecause of their geographic isolation, the Gullah Geechee developed a distinct language and culture, stemming from west and central Africa. Beginning in the late 19th century, theirs was a slow-paced life of fishing and mule carts on dirt roads. Dishes were based around okra, rice and yams. Many of the traditions continue today, with heritage tours helping provide locals with an income as well as cultural preservation. Threats loom, however.\n\nEarlier this year Queen Quet appeared in front of a congressional committee to explain how prized seafood is disappearing as the waters warm. Shellfish are threatened as the ocean acidifies while once-common catfish are vanishing. Her people\u2019s unique culture \u201cwill not continue to thrive or survive if we are displaced from the Sea Islands,\u201d Queen Quet warned.\n\nThe plight of the Gullah Geechee is echoed in other distinct cultures across the US that find themselves on the frontline of the climate crisis. Often forced on to land vulnerable to drought or flooding by colonial dispossession and a lack of political clout, these communities face an overwhelming threat to their way of life.\n\n\u201cThere will be tremendous stories of adaption and change as well as horrifying stories of losing homelands, family and cultural practices,\u201d said Kyle Whyte, an expert in indigenous environmental issues at Michigan State and a member of the Potawatomi native American people.\n\n\u201cLots of indigenous cultures place importance upon resilience but that doesn\u2019t mean that climate change risks aren\u2019t a threat. Many are going to have to work very hard to maintain their way of life.\u201d\n\n\u2018Home is being eaten by the sea\u2019\n\nIn Arizona, the Navajo are under pressure from rising temperatures and a dwindling water supply. In Washington state, the Quinault Indian Nation is attempting to relocate the village of Taholah \u2013 including its housing, post office, school, daycare, gym and police and fire service \u2013 to 200 acres of higher ground due to the threat of riverine flooding.", "description": "Fierce storms and rising seas are causing existential angst for communities in Alaska, Arizona and other states on the front line of the climate crisisQueen Quet at the Hunting Island Nature Center in St Helena Island, South Carolina. \u2018Our very existence is threatened by the rapid erosion of our Sea", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rQsvaZWm9OP.fRtedtAO8A--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/7787ffb090bfc04db58274000b343bb6", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
