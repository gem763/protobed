It's crazy.\"\n\nDiamond wrote the deal memo for Emily Zamourka, who has been living on the streets of Los Angeles for two years.\n\nShe catapulted to public attention after the Los Angeles Police Department tweeted a video filmed by one of their officers of Zamourka singing.\n\n4 million people call LA home. 4 million stories. 4 million voices...sometimes you just have to stop and listen to one, to hear something beautiful. pic.twitter.com/VzlmA0c6jX \u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) September 27, 2019\n\nThe video quickly went viral and led to Zamourka being identified by name.\n\nZamourka's stunning soprano voice not only caught the attention of Diamond, the music producer, but also Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth, who sent her a message, saying, \"I just wanna say to you, you better continue on.\"\n\n\"Real things are happening. Real people are talking and it just, it's awesome,\" Zamourka told \"GMA.\"\n\nZamourka said her favorite music genre is opera but she also likes gospel and is open to any music style.\n\nThe record Diamond wants to produce with her is a combination of classical plus electronic dance music (EDM). He wants to title it \"Paradise.\"\n\n\"I have two tracks ready to go that I've been holding,\" Diamond said. \"I didn't have an artist, so that's like the perfect fit.\"\n\nZamourka was reunited late Wednesday night with the Los Angeles police officer whose video of her shot her to stardom. The two embraced in a long hug during their reunion that was captured on video too.\n\nWe saw with our brains, but we listened with our hearts.\n\n\n\nHer voice continues to captivate our city, and as the offers for help pour in, we asked: \u201cEmily, what can we do for you?\u201d Her answer: \u201cI want to thank Officer Frazier for taking the video.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer wish was granted tonight. pic.twitter.com/lH4V51YTZ4 \u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) October 3, 2019\n\nZamourka said she is \"overwhelmed\" that her dreams are coming true.\n\n\"I achieved something finally that I was longing for ... to become a professional singer,\" she said. \"I am overwhelmed and I am ready to to to be a working artist.\"", "description": "Emily Zamourka says she is", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190930_gma_play_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
