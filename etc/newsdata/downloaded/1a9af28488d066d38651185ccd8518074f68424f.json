Gareth Shaw said: 'Barclays' decision to bow to public pressure and reverse this move will be a massive relief for its customers, who have seen almost 500 high street branches close over the last four years. 'This issue highlights the fragility of our cash infrastructure in the UK, with no safety net for people affected when a company makes a damaging commercial decision - like cutting cash withdrawals from the post office network. 'The industry cannot be relied on to prevent people being stripped of access to cash and vital financial services, so the government must urgently intervene with legislation that protects cash for as long as it is needed.'\n\nFSB National Chairman Mike Cherry today said: 'Barclays has made the right decision. The Post Office can only fulfil the vital role we need it to play in our cash network if all the banks are behind it.\n\n'This decision will come as a huge relief to its small business customers, many of which have been left in the lurch by bank branch closures and are reliant on post offices for cash deposit and withdrawal facilities.'\n\nIt comes as city minister John Glen became the fourth Government minister to wade in on the argument.\n\nHe said yesterday that customers are free to leave the bank whose decision is purely commercial and aimed at saving \u00a37million per year.\n\nIt is more than two weeks since Barclays announced a ban on customers withdrawing their savings at the Post Office.\n\nMany customers threatened to quit the bank unless bosses reversed the decision.\n\nIt previously emerged that Barclays had lost 80,000 current accounts in the year to June, with only Halifax shedding more. Mr Glen, replying to a written Commons question from Lib Dem MP Jane Dodds, said: 'If Barclays customers value withdrawing cash over the counter using the Post Office, they may wish to consider switching to an alternative bank.\n\nBusiness secretary Andrea Leadsom, pictured, is one of four ministers to have criticised Barclays bank after the firm announced it was no longer going to allow customers to withdraw cash from the Post Office\n\nHe added: 'Customers are more able than ever to hold their banks to account by voting with their feet, and that banks are incentivised to work hard to retain their existing customers and attract new ones.'\n\nHis comments follow private interventions from the Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Post Office minister Kelly Tolhurst with Barclays executives.\n\nLord Duncan, a minister in the business department, said earlier this week the bank had been told in 'words of only one syllable' that its behaviour was unacceptable.\n\nMore than 120 MPs accused it of abandoning vulnerable customers and adding to the cash crisis.\n\nThe bank has closed around 490 branches over five years. More than 15million cash withdrawals were carried out by the bank's customers at post offices in 2018.", "description": "Customers of the bank will now be able to continue to take money out over the counter at thousands of Post Office branches in the UK, after plans had been announced to axe the service.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/01/20062134-0-image-a-83_1571876471567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
