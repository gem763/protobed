Some people are,\u2019 he wrote.\n\n\u20182) Boasting about the BGT ratings and popularity when you were briefly on it to someone who has not only transformed the show but is consistently the biggest-selling author in the country didn\u2019t work.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Hi Matt, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2018polite\u2019 to be friendly to people in person but poisonous behind their back \u2013 it\u2019s cowardly,\u2019 Piers responded.\n\n\u2018As for BGT, I was very proudly on it for the first 4 years when ratings topped 20 million. They\u2019re now half that. Not a boast, just a fact.\u2019\n\nIt seemed the Little Britain star wasn\u2019t in the mood for a night-time internet argument as he urged the presenter: \u2018Go to bed.\u2019\n\nHe wasn\u2019t in the mood for a night-time internet argument (Picture: Twitter)\n\nHowever, Piers went in for the last word as he told Matt: \u2018Fight your own battles. You certainly fought one with him long enough.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Matt and David were at odds for a few years during their careers together.\n\nThey first fell out in 2005 during their Little Britain Live Tour, with Matt revealing in his autobiography that they were \u2018often at loggerheads\u2019 over minor issues.\n\nThe two eventually stopped speaking in 2011, the same year Come Fly With Me was broadcast.\n\nMatt and David stopped talking in 2010 but have since put their differences aside (Picture: Jon Furniss/WireImage)\n\nHowever, the duo have since made amends, delighting fans as they posted snaps of themselves reuniting.\n\nPiers was a judge on Britain\u2019s Got Talent for the first four series, alongside Simon Cowell and Amanda Holden.\n\nWhile Michael McIntyre and David Hasselhoff stepped in for series five, from series six onwards, the judging panel had a revamp, featuring Alesha Dixon and David.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMeanwhile, Piers has faced a huge amount of backlash in the past few days, after a poll on Good Morning Britain, which asked viewers whether or not he should be removed from the show, appeared to backfire in a big way.\n\nThe final results of the poll, which has more than 400,000 votes, show 60% voting for him to leave.\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t seem too bothered by the whole affair, after gloating on the show that it had led to a pay rise for him.\n\n\u2018Let me tell you what you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve helped me get a pay rise,\u2019 he said. \u2018So, cheers. Cheers everybody.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted ITV and reps for David for comment.", "description": "Matt Lucas defends Little Britain co-star David Walliams against Good Morning Britain's Piers Morgan after Britain's Got Talent comments.", "authors": ["Louise Griffin"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90099346_1571210140.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
