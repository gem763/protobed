The deadline expires on Monday.\n\nA chorus of voices, from union leaders to politicians, has joined calls for Hariri's government to resign.\n\nThe protests have spread across the country since Thursday. Banks were closed on Monday and the main labour union went on strike, threatening further paralysis.\n\n\"The message to the politicians is don't ever underestimate the power of the people because once they unite they will explode - peacefully,\" said Hiba Dandachli, 36, a social entrepreneur who was helping to organize the clean-up.\n\n\"There are children, families, all from different religions and backgrounds,\" she said. \"If the politicians learn from this they will learn how to lead the country much better.\"", "description": "Lebanon set to cut ministers' pay as protests engulf country", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
