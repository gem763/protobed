Artemis was the twin sister of Apollo and goddess of the Moon in Greek mythology. NASA has chosen her to personify its path back to the Moon, which will see astronauts return to the lunar surface by 2024 - including the first woman and the next man. Artemis 1, formerly Exploration Mission-1, is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions that will enable human exploration to the Moon and Mars. Artemis 1 will be the first integrated flight test of NASA\u2019s deep space exploration system: the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the ground systems at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Artemis 1 will be an uncrewed flight that will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration, and demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond. During this flight, the spacecraft will launch on the most powerful rocket in the world and fly farther than any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown. It will travel 280,000 miles (450,600 km) from Earth, thousands of miles beyond the Moon over the course of about a three-week mission. Artemis 1, formerly Exploration Mission-1, is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions that will enable human exploration to the Moon and Mars. This graphic explains the various stages of the mission Orion will stay in space longer than any ship for astronauts has done without docking to a space station and return home faster and hotter than ever before. With this first exploration mission, NASA is leading the next steps of human exploration into deep space where astronauts will build and begin testing the systems near the Moon needed for lunar surface missions and exploration to other destinations farther from Earth, including Mars. The will take crew on a different trajectory and test Orion\u2019s critical systems with humans aboard. The SLS rocket will from an initial configuration capable of sending more than 26 metric tons to the Moon, to a final configuration that can send at least 45 metric tons. Together, Orion, SLS and the ground systems at Kennedy will be able to meet the most challenging crew and cargo mission needs in deep space. Eventually NASA seeks to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon by 2028 as a result of the Artemis mission. The space agency hopes this colony will uncover new scientific discoveries, demonstrate new technological advancements and lay the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who also spoke at the IAC was in agreement with the advanced timeline.\n\n'With Apollo in the history books, the Artemis mission has begun, and we are well on our way to making NASA's moon-to-Mars mission a reality,' Pence said, according to Space.com.\n\nThe vice president also noted that the US must partner with other countries who share the same goals if they are to make the timeline happen.\n\n'To be clear, our vision is to be a leader amongst freedom-loving nations on the adventure into the great unknown,' Pence said at the conference.\n\n'The United States of America will always be willing to work closely with like-minded, freedom-loving nations as we lead mankind into the final frontier.'\n\nThe last manned Moon landing happened in 1972, as part of the Apollo 17 mission.\n\nThere have only been six times that astronauts have walked on the Moon, all of which were carried out by NASA as part of its Apollo program.", "description": "NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said humans could land on Mars by 2035, as a result of the accelerated moon mission set for 2024, which will prepare humans for the Red Planet.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/19/20049312-0-image-a-22_1571768744842.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
