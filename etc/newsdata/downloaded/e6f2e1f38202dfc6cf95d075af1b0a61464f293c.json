We didn\u2019t get the green light in time for Jennifer\u2019s schedule, and then the studio [Annapurna Pictures] let go of the project. And then we had to take it around again. I was taking it really personally. I [rewrote] the script once, and everybody [at STX Films, where Lopez had connections] agreed that wasn\u2019t the movie. I was grateful for that. Then I rewrote it again. Because they said to me \u2014 and I\u2019ll never forget this \u2014 \u201cJust write the movie that you want to make.\u201d So I was able to take into account what everybody liked about each draft, and try to put it together into something that was actually the movie that I wanted, which was the story of friendship and money. I handed in that draft in mid-January, kind of not expecting anything to happen, to be honest. And then the next day they called. \u201cHustlers\u201d got the green light, and here we are eight months later. I finished the movie a week and half ago.", "description": "The caper stars Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu as dancers at a strip club who drug wealthy men and max out their credit cards", "authors": ["Rebecca Ritzel", "Rebecca Ritzel Is A Freelance Journalist Who Focuses On Arts", "Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/at_Dj4Rww21u3y6JZVr04LqsukA=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYXHDIKSYBGB3KCY2H5GWKQGG4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
