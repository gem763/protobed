I just want to say that if you want to talk about unity and stopping this movement toward fascism, you can\u2019t be attacking people that could change things,\u201d he continued.\n\nStern also pressed him about his donation in 2006 to Republican candidates such as Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, which he argued was motivated by his opposition to the Iraq War.\n\n\u201cUm \u2026 yeah, I think we\u2019re all allowed to make a mistake or two. And by the way, none of them would give refunds. Honestly, there\u2019s no \u2026 I made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it had something to do with the Democratic candidates they were running against having supported the Iraq War, and I must have read an article suggesting that these people were moderates and blah blah. \u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a strange blurp but \u2026 how many years ago was that?\u201d he continued. \u201cThirteen years ago and we\u2019re still talking about it? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old actor remains a committed supporter of Bernie Sanders\u2019s bid to the Democratic presidential nomination, while also working on projects surrounding prison reform.\n\nNever shy about his feelings towards Donald Trump, he last year declared without evidence at an awards ceremony that America had placed a \u201cchild abuser\u201d in the White House, while also likening him to a \u201cpetulant, overgrown child monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomehow we have willingly chosen to go backward to a world full of ignorance and distrust,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThis new revolution has to come from our hearts.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Tim Robbins has warned that the Democratic Party must unify in order to prevent America's \"movement towards fascism.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/timrobbins1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
