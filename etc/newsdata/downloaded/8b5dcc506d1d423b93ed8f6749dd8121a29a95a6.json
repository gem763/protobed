Opera", "language": "en", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Opera star Placido Domingo resigned Wednesday as general director of the Los Angeles Opera and withdrew from all future performances, following multiple allegations from women who say the legendary tenor sexually harassed them there and at opera companies around the country over a period of decades.\n\nDomingo\u2019s departure from LA Opera raises questions about his future career in the United States, where he has been removed or has stepped down from all scheduled appearances since the allegations were first reported by The Associated Press.\n\nIn two reports published Aug. 13 and Sept. 5 , the AP spoke to more than 20 women who accused Domingo of sexual harassment or other inappropriate, sexually charged conduct. Many said Domingo tried to pressure them into sexual relationships and sometimes punished them professionally if they rejected him. All said they feared reporting him because of his power to make or break their careers, and that his behavior was an open secret in the opera world.\n\nThe accusers\u2019 stories laid out strikingly similar patterns of behavior that included Domingo persistently contacting them _ often calling them repeatedly at home, late at night _ expressing interest in their careers and urging them to meet him privately at his apartment or a hotel room, or for a drink or meal, under the guise of offering professional advice. Several women said they took extreme measures to avoid Domingo, hiding from him in dressing rooms, not answering their phones or asking male colleagues to walk them to their cars so they wouldn\u2019t be alone.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Three other companies _ the Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera _ had already removed Domingo from upcoming performances in the wake of the AP stories.\n\nOne singer, Angela Turner Wilson, told AP that Domingo reached into her robe and forcefully grabbed her breast in a makeup room during a 1999 production at the Washington Opera. Another singer said when she worked with Domingo at LA Opera in the mid-2000s, he stuck his hand down her skirt after asking her to sing for him at his apartment. Others said he forced wet kisses on their lips.\n\nDebra Katz, an attorney for mezzo-soprano Patricia Wulf, who told AP that Domingo made repeated, unwanted propositions to her when they sang in Washington, said in a statement the singer\u2019s resignation from LA Opera was \u201can important and welcome step in the effort to end sexual misconduct by powerful men in the opera industry.\u201d\n\nWulf and other accusers have said they spoke up because they felt shining a light on Domingo\u2019s behavior could help stop misconduct across the industry.\n\n\u201cI feel at peace knowing that speaking publicly is leading to changes that will hopefully protect the next generation of women in the industry,\u201d Wulf said Wednesday.\n\nDomingo has denied any wrongdoing. He has called the claims \u201cin many ways, simply incorrect,\u201d but has not elaborated or addressed any of the accusations directly.\n\nFor years, Domingo has been the opera world\u2019s most bankable star, with the celebrity power to fill seats in an era of dwindling ticket sales. Over time, he also widened his portfolio, becoming a prolific conductor and powerful administrator as the general director of two major American companies, first at Washington Opera and later at LA Opera, where he served as an artistic consultant from 1984 to 2000, artistic director from 2000 to 2003 and, finally, general director from 2003 until now. His current contract ran through the 2021-22 season.\n\nChristopher Koelsch, the LA Opera\u2019s president and chief executive, thanked Domingo for \u201chis integral role in the creation of our company and his decades of service,\u201d in an email sent to LA Opera staff on Wednesday.\n\nHe noted that an independent investigation that LA Opera launched into Domingo\u2019s alleged misconduct would \u201ccontinue until its resolution.\u201d\n\nLA Opera had removed Domingo from day-to-day operations as general director after the allegations were published. It has not given a timeframe for the investigation, which is being led by Debra Wong Yang, a former U.S. attorney and Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, now a partner at the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher.\n\n\u201cThis has been a painful and challenging period for all of us,\u201d Koelsch wrote in the email. \u201cBut it is also engendering difficult, and productive, conversations that I believe will ultimately prove critical in strengthening and improving the company.\u201d\n\n\u201cLA opera knows we must take further steps to guarantee we are doing everything we can to foster a professional and collaborative environment,\u201d Koelsch wrote.\n\nDomingo is also being investigated by the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing many opera employees. The union\u2019s national executive director, Len Egert, said that investigation will also continue despite Domingo\u2019s LA Opera resignation.\n\n\u201cOur internal investigation has never been just about allegations against one individual,\u201d Egert said in an email, adding the union was committed to confronting \u201csystemic failures\u201d in the industry that may have allowed the alleged conduct to continue for decades. \u201cWe owe it to our members to continue our investigation.\u201d\n\nFor at least the rest of the year, Domingo\u2019s career will be centered in Europe, where the accusations of harassment have not hurt him professionally. He was greeted with ovations at concerts in August in Austria, shortly after the accusations emerged.\n\nNone of Domingo\u2019s upcoming performances in Europe have been canceled; he has a busy fall lineup of operas and concerts in Switzerland, Russia, Austria, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "His resignation follows multiple allegations from women who say the legendary tenor sexually harassed them over decades.", "authors": ["Jocelyn Gecker"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19275719754827.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C4545px%2C2379px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
