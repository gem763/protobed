Bloomberg News first reported the news.\n\nAt 16:05 GMT, December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are trading 26795, up 20 or +0.07%. This is down from an earlier high of 26894, and up from an earlier low of 26637.\n\nVolume is well below average because of the U.S. Columbus Day holiday. The Treasury markets are closed as well as many banks. The low volume is affecting the price action by holding the market in a range.\n\nDaily December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average More\n\nDaily Technical Analysis\n\nThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. The trend turned up on Friday when buyers took out the 26615 main top. The main trend will change to down on a trade through 25983.\n\nOn Monday, the Dow is posting an inside move that tends to indicate investor indecision and impending volatility. The low holiday volume and the confusion over the trade deal are also keeping investors on the sidelines.\n\nThe short-term range is 27312 to 25703. Its retracement zone at 26697 to 26508 is support. This zone is also controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.\n\nThe major retracement zone support comes in at 26163 to 25892.\n\nDaily Technical Forecast\n\nBased on the early price action and the current price at 26795, the direction of the December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures contract into the close on Monday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the short-term Fibonacci level at 26697.\n\nBullish Scenario\n\nA sustained move over 26697 will indicate the presence of buyers. If big volume happens to return, we could see a surge into the downtrending Gann angle at 26976. Additional targets are minor tops at 27040 and 27112.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nA sustained move under 26697 will signal the presence of sellers. The first two targets are a downtrending Gann angle at 26640 and an uptrending Gann angle at 26599.\n\nThe latter is a potential trigger point for a break into the short-term 50% level at 26508.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Based on the early price action and the current price at 26795, the direction of the December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures contract into the close on Monday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the short-term Fibonacci level at 26697.", "authors": ["James Hyerczyk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A3LGfC78r5ujMhC9suNpSQ--~B/aD00MDI7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/b8a28f70e1e5de336659b0cf7c887fd4", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
