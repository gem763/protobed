(NASDAQ:ORRF) Be Valuable To Income Investors?", "language": "en", "text": "Is Orrstown Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORRF) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nWhile Orrstown Financial Services's 2.8% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNasdaqCM:ORRF Historical Dividend Yield, September 3rd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Orrstown Financial Services paid out 47% of its profit as dividends. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\n\nWe update our data on Orrstown Financial Services every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Orrstown Financial Services's dividend payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.88 in 2009, compared to US$0.60 last year. This works out to be a decline of approximately 3.8% per year over that time. Orrstown Financial Services's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 3.8% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.\n\nA shrinking dividend over a ten-year period is not ideal, and we'd be concerned about investing in a dividend stock that lacks a solid record of growing dividends per share.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Orrstown Financial Services's earnings per share have been essentially flat over the past five years. Over the long term, steady earnings per share is a risk as the value of the dividends can be reduced by inflation.\n\nConclusion\n\nDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Firstly, we like that Orrstown Financial Services has a low and conservative payout ratio. Second, earnings per share have been essentially flat, and its history of dividend payments is chequered - having cut its dividend at least once in the past. While we're not hugely bearish on it, overall we think there are potentially better dividend stocks than Orrstown Financial Services out there.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Orrstown Financial Services, Inc.
