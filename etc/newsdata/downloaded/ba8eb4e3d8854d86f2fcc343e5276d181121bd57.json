One of the most well-known attractions to be impacted is SeaWorld.\n\nTickets currently on sale and found to breach the new rules will be removed from the site over the next few months, with the policy in full force by the end of 2019. The new policy will not apply to seaside sanctuaries that provide care to cetaceans already in captivity.\n\nTripAdvisor says it will no longer sell tickets to any commercial facility that either breeds or imports dolphins, whales or porpoises for public display (file picture)\n\nThe decision follows an extensive consultation process by TripAdvisor with a range of experts, including marine biologists, zoologists and conservationists, and it says it considered the scientific evidence and arguments presented from all sides.\n\nDermot Halpin, president of TripAdvisor experiences and rentals, said: 'The extensive evidence presented to us by the experts was compelling. Whales and dolphins do not thrive in limited captive environments, and we hope to see a future where they live as they should - free and in the wild.\n\n'We believe the current generation of whales and dolphins in captivity should be the last, and we look forward to seeing this position adopted more widely throughout the travel industry.'\n\nConservation groups and animal welfare experts welcomed the move as an important step forward.\n\nDr Naomi Rose, marine mammal scientist at Animal Welfare Institute, said: 'TripAdvisor is on the right side of history.\n\n'Whales and dolphins cannot thrive in captivity and enlightened tourists no longer tolerate exploiting these intelligent and socially complex marine predators for human entertainment.'\n\nWhile Nick Stewart, global head of wildlife and dolphins at World Animal Protection, added: 'This sends a clear message to other travel companies that we must end this cruel industry once and for all.\n\nTickets currently on sale and found to breach the new rules will be removed from TripAdvisor over the next few months, with the policy in full force by the end of 2019\n\n'Together we can ensure this is the last generation of dolphins held captive for entertainment.'\n\nTripAdvisor says its policy extension also takes into account that while it is possible to prevent future generations of cetaceans from a life of captivity, for those already in captivity, the situation is different.\n\nIt adds that for most of the current population of cetaceans, 'release into the wild is not a realistic option. Therefore, the policy includes several stipulations aimed at protecting the needs, safety and health of cetaceans currently in captivity, too'.\n\nMr Halpin explained: 'Our aim is not only to prevent future generations of whales and dolphins from being raised in captivity but also to encourage the industry to move towards alternative models, like seaside sanctuaries, that will better provide for the needs of the current captive population.\n\n'Seaside sanctuaries have enormous potential, but they need more backing from the tourism industry.\n\n'As long as facilities with captive whales and dolphins continue to profit from keeping these animals in smaller, cheaper and less natural living environments, then they don't have enough incentive to adopt serious change. We hope our announcement today can help turn the tide.'\n\nDermot Halpin, president of TripAdvisor experiences and rentals, said: 'Whales and dolphins do not thrive in limited captive environments, and we hope to see a future where they live as they should - free and in the wild'\n\nTripAdvisor says that its animal welfare policy, introduced in 2016, already commits it and its subsidiary brand Viator to no longer sell tickets to experiences where travellers come into physical contact with captive wild animals, such as elephant ride and tiger petting experiences.\n\nThe site says it was further enhanced in 2018, at which point it also banned 'demeaning animal shows and performances' from sale.\n\nTripAdvisor says that for SeaWorld to be compliant with its new policy it would need to 'cease and prevent the breeding of cetaceans in its care, cease the importation of captive cetaceans from other facilities for public display and cease the capture and importation of wild cetaceans for public display'.\n\nSeaWorld maintains the highest standards of care for all animals Dr Chris Dold, SeaWorld\u2019s Chief Zoological Officer\n\nThe travel site said that SeaWorld has committed to not breeding orcas, but has not made the same commitment for other cetaceans in its care.\n\nSeaWorld said that it was disappointed with the announcement and claimed that, regarding conservation and animal welfare, it is a force for good.\n\nDr Chris Dold, SeaWorld\u2019s Chief Zoological Officer, said: 'We are disappointed by TripAdvisor\u2019s new position that ignores the educational value and conservation mission of professionally accredited zoos and aquariums.\n\n'SeaWorld believes deeply in the mission of these organizations. As a member of WAZA, certified by American Humane, and accredited by AZA, as well as numerous other certifications and accreditations from leading accrediting bodies, SeaWorld maintains the highest standards of care for all animals, including cetaceans.\n\n'And regardless of TripAdvisor\u2019s position, SeaWorld will continue to advance education and animal conservation efforts along with our millions of supporters, professional scientists and other science based organizations around the world.'\n\nEarlier this year both British Airways and Virgin Holidays announced they too would be scrapping ticket sales to attractions that feature captive wild animals.\n\nHoliday companies have been under pressure to axe visits to places where orcas are kept in captivity after a public backlash in 2013 following the release of the documentary Blackfish.\n\nThe film argued that orcas held in captivity become more aggressive towards humans and each other.", "description": "Tickets currently on sale and found to breach the new rules will be removed from the US-based travel site over the next few months, with the policy in full force by the end of 2019.", "authors": ["Jennifer Newton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/15/19158078-0-image-a-81_1569939675140.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
