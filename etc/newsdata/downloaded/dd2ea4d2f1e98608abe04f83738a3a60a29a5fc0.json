No further details from the hearing can be disclosed.\n\nThe victim, who cannot be named because of his age, is said to be making progress after being in a critical condition.\n\nHowever, his family said in a statement this week that \u201cour little boy doesn\u2019t know any more how to speak, to eat or to move his body\u201d but that he is beginning to do his best to move his tongue, his right arm and hand.\n\nAn update on a GoFundMe page that has raised almost \u00a3100,000 for the boy\u2019s medical care said on Monday: \u201cWe see his efforts. We believe with all our heart that he will find the way, from his head, to do everything again.\n\n\u201cHe is very brave. He keeps on smiling and reacting to our jokes. We begin to see also, unfortunately, his suffering. Actually, he understands everything, but doesn\u2019t understand why he cannot manage to eat or swallow a little bit of yogurt for instance \u2026 and he wants so much to be able to do it.\u201d", "description": "Judge says Jonty Bravery can be identified, as victim remains unable to speak or move body", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60c26f264be86222b4c3d9407ddfc157ed01c83f/0_92_1512_907/master/1512.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab80907556e884a0cfc36e4da605c2b8"}
