(Submitted by Michael Coren)\n\nMichael Coren was, for many years, a hero to conservative Christians, a champion of \"traditional family values.\" He underwent a very public change of heart, and abandoned his connection to the Catholic church.\n\nHe has since found a new religious home, and later this month he will be ordained as an Anglican priest. Coren emphasizes the distance between how people pray and how people vote.\n\n\"Within Catholicism, which is 40-odd percent of Canada,\" he says, \"most Canadian Catholics vote according to their class, not according to their religion.\"\n\nHe argues that religion should be seen less as a buzzword during election campaigning. \"In Canada we can speak of our Christianity but too often it's a euphemism for conservatism,\" says Coren.\n\nWe are a very diverse and multi-faith country...

She claims that it is religious belief that motivates politicians towards doing better by Canadians.\n\n\"Religious people are often motivated by their faith,\" she says. \"By their interest in seeing Canada be a better country they're motivated to become involved in political life.\"\n\nFor Buckingham, the reality is that Canada is strong in its support of multiple faiths. \"We are a very diverse and multi-faith country,\" she says. \"That is part of our identity as a country.
