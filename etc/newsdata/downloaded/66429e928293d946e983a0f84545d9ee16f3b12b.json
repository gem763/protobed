I was confused why Simon would tell me I could win this thing and then ultimately send me home.\n\n'It was a punch in the gut. People have emotions and mine got the best of me... because I REALLY wanted this.\n\n'Punch in the gut!' Former Love Actually singer Olivia Olson has slammed Simon Cowell for his bizarre decision to axe her from X Factor: Celebrity, choosing to save broadcast journalist Martin Bashir\n\nI knew going into @thexfactor anything could happen and the level of talent was so high this year! I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity as it has completely pushed me out of my comfort zone, reminding myself I love to be up on that stage.\n\n'I\u2019m proud of my performance last night and that\u2019s what matters to me. Good luck to all my new friends I\u2019ve made along the way. OO out!'\n\nThis was met by a barrage of support from her fans and co-stars, including Ricki Lake - who was also eliminated - Jenny Ryan and Max & Harvey.\n\nHaving been given a second shot at fame as a singer, Simon Cowell made the decision to eliminate Louis Walsh's act Olivia after choosing between her - a seasoned singer - and journalist Martin, Nicole Scherzinger's act.\n\nTaking to her Instagram page, Olivia, 27, posted: 'My elimination came as a shock. I was confused why Simon would tell me I could win this thing and then ultimately send me home. 'It was a punch in the gut. People have emotions and mine got the best of me... because I REALLY wanted this'\n\n'Danke Schoen Simon' Martin lives to sing another day\n\nSimon's strange reasoning was that Martin is 'who the public would want to go through'.\n\nBut the public seemed to totally disagree with Simon's left-field decision to keep Martin in the show - which offers a prize at the end of it of a record deal.\n\nSome claimed it was a 'fix', with one typing, 'It\u2019s not a popularity competition. Olivia shouldn\u2019t have gone! Fix!' and another posting: 'What a fix Olivia was fabulous!'\n\nChoices: Having been given a second shot at fame as a singer, Simon Cowell made the decision to eliminate Louis Walsh's act Olivia after choosing between her - a seasoned singer - and journalist Martin, Nicole Scherzinger's act\n\nSad to leave: Chat show host Ricki Lake was eliminated after a shaky performance and mixed comments from the judges\n\n'I cannot believe that Simon Cowell put Martin through over Olivia! What a complete disgrace think it\u2019s time to stop watching this farce,' one impassioned viewer ranted on Twitter.\n\nPosting a GIF of Olivia's on-screen love interest waving at her in Love Actually, another person tweeted: 'Simon waving goodbye to the credibility (if it had any) of the show by sending home Olivia...'\n\nAnother raged: 'What a farce! OLIVIA vs Martin? No contest! This is a load of bull. Not interested anymore bye bye x factor, no longer what it used to be.'\n\nUproar: The public seemed to totally disagree with Simon's left-field decision to keep Martin in the show - which offers a prize at the end of it of a record deal\n\n'Simon Cowell what a disgrace, saving Martin over Olivia. He used to be fair and straight to the point. Doing it for ratings is going to backfire on him,' another posted.\n\nFollowed by: 'I don\u2019t think Simon understands that the public are sensible enough to want the best singers. Its a travesty to get rid of Olivia and keep Martin. He should never have got through in the first place!'\n\n'I was crying with Olivia. She was so genuine and heartbroken I felt really sorry for her. Most brutal elimination I've ever seen. I liked Martin but Olivia was better, Simon made a bad choic,' came another post.\n\nFollowed by: 'No offence, but today\u2019s show was absolute S***E. Martin over OLIVIA?? I cannot believe what a s***e decision Simon made. Not one person wants to see Martin Bashir.'\n\nDecision time: Deciding between the two acts, Nicole Scherzinger chose to save her own act Martin, while Louis Walsh opted to keep his act Olivia\n\nDevastated: After learning her fate, Olivia broke down in tears, stating, 'I'm not okay' after host Dermot asked how she felt\n\nGracious in defeat: The vote came after Ricki won the least amount of votes from fans, with the star jokingly declaring afterwards - 'I guess I have to stick to my day job!'\n\n'Can\u2019t believe Olivia was sent home makes the program a complete joke. Martin is a lovely chap but he can\u2019t sing!!!' pointed out another.\n\nThe cruel decision came after Olivia put on a less-than-great rendition of Dionne Warwick's Anyone Who Had A Heart.\n\nSimon and Nicole originally praised her for making the best of a bad song choice, not faulting her talent as a songstress.\n\nMartin sang Wayne Newton's Danke Schoen while Ricki sang Landslide by Stevie Nicks.\n\nX Factor: Celebrity returns next Saturday night on ITV.", "description": "Former Love Actually singer Olivia Olson has slammed Simon Cowell for his bizarre decision to axe her from X Factor: Celebrity, choosing to save broadcast journalist Martin Bashir.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/11/20241156-0-image-a-53_1572175288882.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
