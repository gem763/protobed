Possibly the worst ever was the breach of Yahoo that happened over the span of about four years.\n\nYahoo has since admitted more than 3 billion accounts were hacked during that time, and now the company is close to settling a multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit. And you might be entitled to monetary damages.\n\nSpeaking of money, a reader recently took my advice and looked for his unclaimed money. In a few weeks, he got a check for over $25,000. Maybe there\u2019s money waiting for you to claim. Tap or click here for 4 places to look for money you may be owed.\n\nIf you had a Yahoo account during a certain period of time, you could be eligible to receive some monetary compensation. Depending on circumstances, that payout could be anywhere from $100 to up to $25,000.\n\nClass-action suit payouts\n\nSettlement money from a class-action lawsuit doesn\u2019t usually amount to much, maybe a few dollars. Occasionally, class-action suits can be very profitable for people other than the attorneys. I\u2019m a good example: I just received a check for almost $1,400. Tap or click here for class-action lawsuits paying out now from cars to smartphones.\n\nIn an email sent to users, Yahoo revealed it has received preliminary approval from a court for a $117.5 million settlement. The class-action lawsuit stems from a series of data breaches between 2012 and 2016. Here\u2019s what happened:\n\n2012 \u2014 Two separate hackers accessed Yahoo\u2019s internal systems but didn\u2019t take anything.\n\n2013 \u2014 Hackers got into Yahoo's database and took records from about 3 billion users' accounts. The breach could have been much worse as the hackers could have gotten into users\u2019 email accounts, calendars and contacts.\n\n2014 \u2014 Hackers once again got into Yahoo\u2019s user database and stole the names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birthdays, passwords, and security questions and answers from about 500 million accounts.\n\n2015-2016 \u2014 Hackers used cookies to infiltrate about 32 million email accounts.\n\nRELATED: 2019 is on track to be the worst year yet for data breaches. Tap or click here for one trick to protect yourself as data breaches hit an all-time high.\n\nIf you had a Yahoo account during those years, you could be eligible for $100 in compensation or free credit monitoring \u2014 or much more if your identity was stolen.\n\nHow to get your money\n\nSo who is eligible? If you had a Yahoo account between Jan. 1, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2016, and you\u2019re a resident of the U.S. or Israel, you can make a claim on the settlement.\n\nDepending on circumstances, some Yahoo users could get as much as $25,000. To get that much, you would have to prove you had to spend time or money dealing with problems caused by the hack, such as identity theft. Small businesses and those who paid for premium Yahoo services may also get more money.\n\nRELATED: After a data breach, your first priority is securing your accounts with new passwords. Tap or click for 5 rules for creating strong passwords that will keep hackers out.\n\nIf you're only eligible for the $100 and want that instead of free credit protection, you'll have to verify you\u2019re already signed up for a credit-monitoring service. Before you get too excited though, remember what happened to Equifax users.\n\nMillions of Americans submitted claims to get the $125 offered by Equifax as part of its $425 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over a massive data breach in 2017. Consumers stampeded to claim their $125 not knowing that there was a $31 million cap on cash claims.\n\nThe pool of money quickly shrank and consumers will have to settle for a few bucks or opt for free credit monitoring instead. The same thing could happen with Yahoo.\n\nBut if you want to try your luck on the cash, visit the Yahoo claim website and fill out the claim form that applies to you. You have until July 20, 2020 to stake your claim. But do it now while you\u2019re thinking about it.
