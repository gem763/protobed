He took me away for a weekend break, and he asked me out over dinner in London the next day.'\n\nLove: Love Island's Maura Higgins and Curtis Pritchard have finally made their romance official three months after leaving the villa and are now boyfriend and girlfriend\n\nWhen asked why it took the couple longer than most to make their relationship official, Curtis insisted he didn't want them to rush into things too quickly.\n\nHe said: 'I want something that's going to last forever. There's no point in rushing things. We've only known each other a short amount of time.'\n\nMaura added that her dancer beau appeared to be quite nervous when he was asking her to be his girlfriend and struggled to get the words out.\n\nWhile some Love Island fans thought they were an odd match, Maura insisted it's a case of opposites attract, saying they finish each other's sentences and know how to make the other laugh.\n\nRomance: They have been dating since their stint on Love Island and Curtis decided to make it official when he asked Maura to be his girlfriend over dinner (pictured in September 2019)\n\nTheir fellow islanders Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague recently took their relationship to the next level by moving in together.\n\nHowever, Curtis said that is not on the cards for him and Maura just yet as they don't feel three months together is long enough before moving in.\n\nNews of the couple's newly cemented relationship status comes after Maura recently admitted in an interview with the Irish Mirror that the pair hadn't seen each other in two weeks.\n\nMaura said: 'He asked and I said yes obviously. He took me away for a weekend break, and he asked me out over dinner in London the next day' (pictured in October 2019)\n\nDuring the interview, the grid girl was quizzed on whether Curtis had finally asked her to be his girlfriend.\n\n'He's not,' she said, adding: 'So we haven't seen each other in two weeks but that's because of our hectic schedules, but I mean, I'm happy with the pace we're going and I think he is as well.'\n\nOn how they manage with such hectic schedules, Maura said: 'I mean, it's not hard. I don't find it hard because I'm kept busy and he is too.\n\n'Obviously it's very different after coming out of the villa where you were with each other 24/7. But coming out, it's a whole new relationship. You're not going to see each other every single day. It's a new relationship. So yeah, I don't find it hard at all.'\n\nSlow: When asked why it took the couple longer than most to make their relationship official, Curtis insisted he didn't want them to rush into things too quickly (pictured in October 2019)\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate interview with The Sun, Curtis insisted that their then-unlabelled relationship was still going strong and will not be shaken when Maura competes on Dancing On Ice next year.\n\nReferring to Dancing On Ice's supposed 'curse', where participants' romances break off either during or shortly after appearing on the show, Curtis said: It's only a curse if you believe in it. I'm sure Maura will be fine... fingers crossed.'\n\nHe added of their relationship: Things are going good. She's in Ireland and flies back tomorrow. I'm working here [in London] but we both understand. We do phone calls and messages. Distance often makes the heart grow fonder.'", "description": "The pair have been dating since their stint on Love Island and Curtis decided to make it official when he whisked Maura away on a romantic weekend and then asked her to be his girlfriend over dinner.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19682112-0-image-a-49_1571041320991.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
