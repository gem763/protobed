It even has bicycles propped up against lamp posts \u2013 Amsterdam styley.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to pick apart Ghent\u2019s charms and to draw comparisons with the continent\u2019s tourism powerhouses, but put all these qualities together and you have what is one of Europe\u2019s most complete and underrated city breaks.\n\nTo make things even better, Ghent is supremely convenient to get to. As the crow flies it is a mere 169 miles (203 km) from London to Ghent, which is closer than the capital to Liverpool (178 miles / 211 km). It\u2019s speedy by rail, too. The Eurostar takes just 2 hours 49 minutes, which is quicker than the train from London to Newcastle, albeit only by a minute or two.", "description": "", "authors": ["Greg Dickinson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/iStock-935366046-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
