The case should absolutely be reviewed by an appellate court.\u201d\n\nOberlin College Board of Trustees Chairman Chris Canavan was quoted in the release as saying the decision to appeal is \u201cgrounded in the board\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to the College\u2019s long-term financial health.\u201d https://t.co/R1SUeyx1eH \u2014 The Chronicle-Telegram (@YourChronicle) October 8, 2019\n\n\n\nOberlin has decried the award as an attack on student free speech, while the Gibson\u2019s legal team has argued that school administrators helped spread student statements, including flyers and a student government resolution, accusing the bakery of racism.\n\nLee Platkas, attorney for the Gibson family, said that \u201cthe law and the facts of this case remain clearly on the side of the Gibson family,\u201d despite efforts by Oberlin officials to \u201creframe this as a First Amendment issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict sent a clear message that institutions like Oberlin College should not be permitted to bully others while hiding behind the claimed shield of free speech,\u201d Mr. Platkas said in a statement. \u201cThere are no exemptions from the law of defamation \u2013 a fact we trust will be confirmed during the appeal process.\u201d\n\nStudent protests accusing the bakery of racial profiling erupted after the Nov. 9, 2016, arrest of three black students after one was chased down and detained by Allyn Gibson. The students later pleaded guilty to attempted theft and aggravated trespass, and issued a statement absolving the Gibsons of racism.\n\nOberlin College hires high-powered D.C. lawyers to appeal Gibson\u2019s Bakery verdict https://t.co/zaiAyMoboT \u2014 Legal Insurrection (@LegInsurrection) October 8, 2019\n\n\n\nAn attorney for Oberlin said the trial court committed procedural errors that \u201cprevented jurors from hearing information about the original incident.\u201d\n\nThe jury awarded the Gibsons $11 million in compensatory damages and $33 million in punitive damages, but the award was later reduced under Ohio\u2019s tort cap to about $25 million. The Gibsons were also awarded $6.5 million in legal fees.\n\nOberlin board chairman Chris Canavan said the famously liberal college has focused on \u201cbridging divides between the community in our community and pursuing academic excellence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe College and the town of Oberlin have been vital to one another since 1833, and we value our long-term relationships with the town\u2019s citizens and businesses,\u201d Mr. Canavan said. \u201cWe also have a mission to support free inquiry, allow faculty and students to ask difficult questions and to reach and express their own conclusions. The judgment in this case effectively punishes us for doing just that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
