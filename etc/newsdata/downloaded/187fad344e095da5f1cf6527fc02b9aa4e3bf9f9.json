Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration\u2019s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: \u2018Dad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet on Sept. 21, not two months after The New Yorker story published, Biden told reporters at the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa something different, reported USA Today.\n\n\u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I know: Trump should be investigated.\u201d\n\nA newly released photo also seems to contradict Biden\u2019s story. In the photo below of the time he was vice president, Joe Biden is seen golfing with his son, Hunter Biden, and an executive board member of the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings. Burisma is the company that paid Hunter Biden $50,000 per month to sit on its board while Joe Biden oversaw Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.\n\nFox News reported the man furthest to the left in the photo below is Devon Archer, who served on the Burisma executive board with Hunter Biden.\n\n\ud83d\udea8BOMBSHELL \ud83d\udea8\n\nBelow photo shows @JoeBiden (as Vice President) and his son Hunter Biden golfing with exec board member of the Ukrainian gas company that was paying his son $50,000 a month.\n\nJoe got the prosecutor investigating the company fired soon after:https://t.co/bu7QunPR7G pic.twitter.com/0aVJNhYQqX \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 1, 2019\n\nAccording to Fox News, the photo was taken at the Hamptons in August 2014, just four months after Hunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma executive board.\n\nIn 2018, Biden publicly celebrated pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was looking into corruption within Burisma, using U.S. aid as leverage:", "description": "Joe Biden told a reporter that he never discussed his son's overseas business dealings, but Hunter Biden told The New Yorker a different story.", "authors": ["Chrissy Clark"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joe-Biden-in-Des-Moines.png"}
