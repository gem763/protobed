The prior was a 3-2 overtime loss to Carolina off a tip-in at the front of the net at the 4:04 mark of overtime.\n\nCapitals Coach Todd Reirden isn\u2019t looking to change up the team\u2019s concepts. Rather, it\u2019s all about finding the right combination of players to be on the ice. Reirden said because the team doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time practicing three-on-three entering the season, he sees the benefits of going through such experiences early.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe should be stronger at than we are right now, and it is up to us; for me, it is to find the right personnel,\u201d said Reirden, whose team is 2-0-2 to start the season. \u201cI am not going to change some of our concepts to it because that hasn\u2019t been the problem. It\u2019s been situations where we have lost races on the ice, and that is something that should not happen to us.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals\u2019 overtime philosophy is fairly simple. It is all about puck management, time management on shifts, understanding who on the opposition is on the ice, attacking forwards, and when there is an opportunity on the rush, take advantage.\n\n\u201cIt is something that, when we are at our best, that is what we are doing,\u201d Reirden said.\n\nAD\n\nKuznetsov, who was on the ice during Dallas\u2019 winning goal Tuesday night, explained the need for players to understand time and space on the ice, understanding how certain 1-on-1 situations quickly can end up in a poor 2-on-1 situation the other way. That\u2019s when patience needs to emphasized.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou just have to hold down on the puck a little bit more, let them tire and as soon as you get a chance you have to execute,\u201d Kuznetsov said. \u201cYou cannot waste a shot. If you have an opportunity you have to understand how important it be for your chance to shoot the puck.\u201d\n\nBut sometimes, things don\u2019t go according to plan. A player can fall down, an ill-timed line shift could swing it the other way, or there is no time to regroup as the puck swings the other direction when a shot goes wide past the net. Reirden said he thinks the evolution of overtime since three-on-three was implemented for the 2015-16 NHL season is how many goals that are scored off the rush and how few are really scored off the offensive zone.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSometimes [expletive] happens,\u201d Kuznetsov said. \u201cYou are not going to predict all the plays, you have to hold onto the puck and control the puck.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGoaltender Braden Holtby said he prepares the same for overtime as he would during regulation, just with the understanding players on the ice having a little more time and space. For him, it\u2019s all about sticking to his habits. When asked if it\u2019s fun or strenuous to play in overtime, Holtby responded it\u2019s \u201cbetter than a shootout.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working on that area,\u201d Holtby said of the team\u2019s overtime play. \u201cHad a couple shifts that were really good and a couple that just we weren\u2019t on the same page and that is just early in the season and we know we have the skill to really dominate over time and it is one of those things that you keep working on.\u201d\n\nCapitals expected lines vs Predators:\n\n\n\nOvechkin-Backstrom-Wilson\n\nVrana-Kuznetsov-Oshie\n\nHagelin-Eller-Panik\n\nLeipsic-Stephenson-Hathaway\n\n\n\nSiegenthaler-Carlson\n\nOrlov-Jensen\n\nGudas-Lewington\n\n\n\nHoltby \u2014 Samantha Pell (@SamanthaJPell) October 10, 2019\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "The Capitals have lost two-straight games in overtime, prior to their Thursday night matchup with Nashville Thursday night.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xxpZ_8rGTDg2Zp2JPxCG4kkByIk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WLZJRAXKG4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
