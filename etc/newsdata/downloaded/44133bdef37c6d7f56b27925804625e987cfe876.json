Von Hoesslin\u2019s communications add another layer to the competing narratives that have shaped the public\u2019s view of the 737 Max crisis - and of who\u2019s most responsible for what went wrong.\n\nIn 418 pages of previously unreported correspondence and documents he sent to airline managers, von Hoesslin cited a number of concerns he said needed to be addressed relating to maintenance, pilot rest and operational procedures. His concerns bring fresh attention to the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines jet, which prompted a worldwide grounding of Boeing\u2019s top-selling passenger jet and the company\u2019s most significant crisis in decades.\n\nVon Hoesslin declined to comment for this story. The documents seen by Bloomberg came from another person who asked not to be identified.\n\nEthiopian Airlines spokesperson Biniam Demssie said by phone: ''I can\u2019t comment on anything right now.'' The airline has said its pilots have completed all the training that Boeing and the FAA recommended.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether von Hoesslin\u2019s suggestions for training would have made a difference, said Jeffrey Guzzetti, the former director of the US Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Accident Investigation Division, noting that crash investigators, regulators and airlines are still evaluating the extent of additional training needed.\n\n''I bet there were numerous other similar discussions within other 737 Max airlines following the Lion Air accident, and I bet considerations were made in some fashion with most of those airlines,'' he said.\n\nVon Hoesslin\u2019s bosses at Ethiopian Airlines, as well as the nation\u2019s Transport Minister, have cast suspicion on a malfunction of the 737 Max feature known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.\n\nThe Chicago-based planemaker, while careful not to be seen blaming a customer, has noted the role pilot actions also played in the Ethiopian and Lion Air disasters.\n\nIn both, pilots unsuccessfully battled automatic nose-down movements commanded by MCAS. The movements were triggered by erroneous readings from one of the Max\u2019s two weather vane-like \u201cangle of attack\u201d sensors on either side of the jet\u2019s nose.\n\nIn the December email, von Hoesslin reminded managers that flight crews could be overwhelmed by multiple warnings and cockpit alerts that can sound during an errant activation of MCAS. Problems with the system led to the 737 Max\u2019s global grounding in March and shook confidence in Boeing and its regulator, the US Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nVon Hoesslin, who identified himself in the documents as a certified 737 instructor, submitted his resignation to Ethiopian Airlines in April. The documents reviewed by Bloomberg, including the December email urging additional training, were attached to von Hoesslin\u2019s resignation letter.\n\nIn his email to several bosses, including those responsible for flight operations and safety, von Hoesslin called attention to the airline\u2019s flight simulator program. The simulators were based on Boeing\u2019s earlier 737 ''Next Generation,'' or NG, family of jets, and the program didn\u2019t replicate MCAS, he said.\n\nAlthough regulators and airlines around the world did not require that pilots train on a Max simulator after the Lion Air crash, Hoesslin took issue with the airline\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cThe sim program does not simulate the MCAS, thus using this older NG has serious drawbacks in our training when operating the Max,\u201d von Hoesslin wrote in an email. \u201cI suggest alternate training methods.\u201d\n\nIn a separate email in November, von Hoesslin asked airline managers to provide more detail about MCAS to \u201cthose Max pilots who are not fully or even aware of how the Max MCAS\u201d system functions. The request came after a flight operations manager at the airline circulated Boeing\u2019s November 6 service bulletin that described, without naming MCAS, how erroneous sensor data could cause the jet to pitch toward the ground automatically, and how pilots should respond.\n\nIn response to von Hoesslin, the manager circulated more details about MCAS that the manager said came from Boeing and that explained the automated flight-control feature in greater detail.\n\nEarlier this month, Ethiopian Airlines said it is \u201camong the very few airlines in the world\u201d that operates a full-flight simulator for the Boeing 737 Max 8 but that it wasn\u2019t configured to simulate MCAS.\n\nOn May 17, two days after a US House hearing in which Missouri Republican Sam Graves cited pilot error as a factor in the fatal crash, Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement that any effort \u201cto divert public attention from the flight control system problem of the airplane is a futile exercise because it is not based on factually correct analysis.\u201d\n\nWhile US aviation regulators and Boeing issued warnings in November that included instructions on how pilots should respond to MCAS\u2019s activation, there was no call for simulator training. Ethiopian Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges has said the pilots followed proper procedures issued after the Lion Air crash.\n\nIn an April 4 statement, Ethiopian Airlines said the preliminary report into the March 10 crash ''clearly showed'' that the pilots followed correct procedure.\n\nHowever, that report shows the pilots left the thrust too high and turned the motor driving MCAS back on after initially switching it off.\n\nIn his resignation letter, von Hoesslin said he felt the airline hadn\u2019t fully responded to his complaints.\n\n\u201cSome of these concerns were safety-related and well within the duty of the airline to adequately address,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "An Ethiopian Airlines pilot has told senior managers at the carrier months before one of its Boeing 737 Max jets crashed that more training and better communication to crew members was needed to avert a repeat of a similar disaster involving a Lion Air flight.", "authors": ["Ryan Beene", "Nizar Manek"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8911/f071b97c97854dd6a992a6200e1c8efa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-29"}
