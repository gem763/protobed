If Morstead hadn't won that honor, it might well have gone to Harris for his 53-yard punt return touchdown.\n\n\"You just kind of go into every game feeling like you are going to be the difference in a positive way, but you just don't know how it's going to play out,\" Morstead said. \"It does feel nice at the end of a game, like that to feel like special teams as a whole made a difference in the game.\"\n\nWhether those phases of the game could again be a significant factor on Sunday night against Dallas remains to be seen, but Cowboys coach Jason Garrett has taken notice of the Saints' special teams' success.\n\n\"What you're trying to do on special teams is do something that can change the game,\" Garrett said. \"Hopefully, you can tip the field, tip the balance of the game and they've been able to do that up to this point and those are the kind of plays that make a huge difference.\"\n\nWhen the Saints' offense has been at its most prolific, it might have been easy to overlook the kicking game's role, particularly in numerous lopsided victories in which New Orleans punted few times.\n\nBut if a game is close, or if the offense is sputtering, then good punting \u2014 and good punt returns \u2014 are at a premium. And it's not clear if the Saints can replicate the offensive production they've historically enjoyed with Brees while another quarterback is under center.\n\nThe Saints used two quarterbacks last week in Seattle. Teddy Bridgewater was the starter and played the vast majority of the offensive snaps. Taysom Hill subbed in as a read-option run threat; he either handed off or ran himself. The Saints gained 265 yards on offense, barely more than half of the Seahawks' 514 yards. New Orleans still won in large part because of special teams play, along with a defensive touchdown on a fumble return.\n\nHill, who also serves as an up-back on punts, said being able to play on special teams with the Saints has helped him appreciate how much that unit can influence games, be it with blocked punts, fake punts, returns or simply good punts.\n\n\"It's all about, in the NFL, winning the field position battle. We talk about it week in and week out,\" Hill said. \"The punt is the biggest contributor to that, and the punt return. And we saw how that affected the game last week.\"\n\nNow in his 11th season out of SMU, Morstead has established himself as one of the elite punters in the NFL. He can send booming spirals far down field with accuracy toward one sideline or the other. He can also chip end-over-end, Australian Rules Football-style punts that seem to stick inside the 10-yard line without going into the end zone for a touchback.\n\n\"Thomas makes our job really easy,\" Hill said. \"When you pin a team or returner, right or left, outside the numbers, it's really difficult for those guys to get a return.\"\n\nMorstead, meanwhile, has enjoyed seeing how Harris, a rookie out of Division II Assumption College, has burst onto the scene as a potent return man.\n\n\"He's obviously very talented. Everybody can see that,\" Morstead said. \"He doesn't lack any confidence.\"\n\nHarris did, however, commit his first major mistake in Seattle when he muffed a punt. The Seahawks recovered, but failed to capitalize when Saints made a fourth-down stop.\n\nMorstead said he told Harris: \"Don't lose your stinger. Keep being aggressive how you've been. You just can't get ahead of yourself.\"\n\nAfter all, the Saints might need a few more good returns while their offense adjusts to life without Brees.", "description": "Between Thomas Morstead placing punts just short of opponents' goal lines and diminutive returner Deonte Harris deftly darting away from tacklers, the New Orleans Saints like the way their special teams have influenced the outcomes of games.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/NFL-Deonte-Harris.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
