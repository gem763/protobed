STC, -6.97% took an afternoon dive Friday toward a 3 1/2-year low, after the Federal Trade Commission issued \"an administrative complaint\" seeking to block the company's acquisition by title insurance provider Fidelity National Financial Inc. FNF, -0.47%. Stewart's stock was down about 4.9% in afternoon trading, but losses accelerated to 8.1% at current levels. The stock was on track to close at the lowest price since March 2016. Fidelity National's stock was up about 1% in afternoon trading, but has swung to a loss of 0.4%. The FTC said it believes the merger would \"substantially reduce competition\" in state markets for title insurance underwriting for large commercial deals, and in several local markets for title information services. In March 2018, Stewart said it agreed to be acquired by Fidelity National in a deal valued at the time at $1.2 billion. Based on stock closing prices at the time, the deal had valued Stewart's stock at a little over $50 each; at current prices, the same deal terms would value Stewart shares at nearly $54 each. Over the past year, Fidelity National shares have gained 11% and Stewart's stock has dropped 26%, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.09% has tacked on 3.6%.", "description": "Shares of Stewart Information Services Corp. took an afternoon dive Friday toward a 3 1/2-year low, after the Federal Trade Commission issued \"an...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
