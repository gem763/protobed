Right Now, She Backs Elizabeth Warren", "language": "en", "text": "Stormy Daniels doesn\u2019t regret working with her previous lawyer, Michael Avenatti, but she does regret trusting him.\n\n\u201cHe just went off the rails,\u201d she told The Daily Beast in a recent interview at her home in New Orleans. Daniels said she would only run for president if Avenatti ever announced he was running\u2014he announced he would not run in 2020 last December\u2014because she would want to run a kamikaze-style campaign to take him down.\n\n\u201cIf he decides to run, I\u2019m going to run just so I can start a GoFundMe for the sheer purpose of making smear campaign videos against him,\u201d Daniels said, laughing. \u201cJust for fun. I bet people would actually be into it.\u201d\n\nAs for who she\u2019s supporting in the 2020 race, Daniels said she hasn\u2019t made up her mind yet, but she\u2019s currently leaning toward Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u201cIf I had to pick somebody right now, I would probably say Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI\u2019m always really hesitant to say because I don\u2019t know if me saying something helps or hurts the person.\u201d\n\nThe attention Daniels has received\u2014around her alleged affair with Trump and the $130,000 in hush money she was given by Michael Cohen\u2014hasn\u2019t always been good for her, she explained.\n\nHouse Democrats announced after our interview that they will be holding hearings focused on the payments that were made to her and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\n\u201cThings are in a lull, but shit is about to hit the fan again,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cIt comes in waves. A whole bunch of stuff happens, and then they schedule court dates and stuff is kind of quiet, but none of the cases are done. We\u2019re just waiting for our next appearance.\u201d (The Daily Beast reported Friday that House Democrats were leaning towards not calling Daniels to testify.)\n\nDaniels said she moved to New Orleans from Dallas, Texas, because someone had published her address in Dallas, and she was worried about the safety of her 8-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cI left Dallas because I was worried about the news trucks outside my house. I thought her life was in danger, so that\u2019s the main reason I stayed on tour all last summer,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cEvery time I wasn\u2019t advertised as being somewhere else, I had about 24 to 48 hours before people figured out I wasn\u2019t scheduled to be somewhere, and my address got printed, so then they\u2019d show up at my house and she couldn\u2019t go ride her bike. People tried to take pictures of her.\u201d\n\nDaniels and I first met when she hosted a party called Midsummer Night\u2019s Cream at a bar called Grand Pres. She explained the proceeds were going to the city\u2019s LGBT community center and that there would be a costume contest where everyone dressed up as fairies.\n\nThe event on Aug. 1 was as wild as you would expect. Queer men and women donned scantily clad outfits, and there was a professional photographer taking photos of people with Daniels\u2014who was wearing a black and blue corset, wings and a tutu.\n\nA few weeks later, her friend Aaron Yeager, who helped her organize the queer party, in attendance, we met at Daniels' home. She introduced me to her 8-week-old Jack Russell terrier, Luci Furr Daniels.\n\nDaniels talked about the event company she had recently started, Swamp Trash Events. She explained that it\u2019s not a charity, but she is going to be hosting more events that benefit charities through the company. Before the queer event, Daniels had hosted a block party in the Marigny section of New Orleans where the proceeds went to the New Orleans Abortion Fund.\n\n\u201cWe did that one on Father\u2019s Day to be especially inappropriate,\u201d she said.\n\nDaniels has long had trouble donating to charities simply because she\u2019s in the porn industry\u2014once even having a check she mailed to an animal rescue returned ripped to pieces\u2014and her connection to President Trump has obviously elevated her name.\n\nYeager said when they were having trouble finding charities to give to, Daniels told him they should just start their own, which they\u2019re in the process of doing. The charity will focus on LGBTQ issues, animal welfare and more.\n\nRegarding queer issues, Stormy explained she was raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by two gay dads, Keith Munyan and J.D. Barrale, and she\u2019s \u201calways been bisexual.\u201d Stormy said she had her first relationship with a girl when she was in high school and has dated men and women since then.\n\nDaniels said she started Swamp Trash Events as a name because she thought she would only be in the spotlight for so long during the scandal with Trump, and she wanted to do something good with it. She said she\u2019s since realized that the spotlight comes and goes as a scandal involving the president unravels.\n\nDaniels said she\u2019s committed to working to help the community in New Orleans, and that\u2019s one of the reasons she started Swamp Trash. She said her next event will probably benefit a battered women\u2019s shelter.\n\n\u201cI want to do a battered women\u2019s event,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI want to be wildly inappropriate and do a fish fry and the logo will be, \u2018Batter your food, not your women.\u2019 Sometimes I\u2019m funny.\u201d", "description": "As Stormy Daniels does LGBTQ fundraising in New Orleans, she talks about \u2018smearing\u2019 Michael Avenatti, supporting Elizabeth Warren, and why \u2018shit is about to hit the fan again.\u2019", "authors": ["Thor Benson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568496654/190915-benson-stormy-daniels-hero_wgfoqi", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
