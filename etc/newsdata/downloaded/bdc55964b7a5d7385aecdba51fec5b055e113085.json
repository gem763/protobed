Two Very Different Views.", "language": "en", "text": "But here was what helped her set go viral: For making those minor nods to reality, Bachman was booed. Video of the scene, posted to Instagram, captured a male voice in the audience responding to Bachman\u2019s references to Weinstein: \u201cShut up!\u201d he shouted. The audience\u2019s impulse to silence her\u2014backlash, in real time\u2014was ratified when Andrew B. Silas, another stand-up performing at the event, presented a decidedly different take on Weinstein\u2019s presence: \u201cI\u2019d like to address the elephant in the room,\u201d Silas said. \u201cWho in this room produced Good Will Hunting? \u2019Cause that shit was great.\u201d\n\nSilas told BuzzFeed News that he\u2019d intended the joke to be supportive of Bachman\u2014a callback to her own reference to the \u201celephant in the room.\u201d (\u201cI swear I\u2019m not a piece of shit,\u201d Silas insisted.) But the effect, of course, was the opposite: Silas\u2019s set seemed to mock Bachman\u2019s\u2014and to insist that Weinstein\u2019s presence at the show was its own kind of light joke. BuzzFeed reported that the Downtime owners had given performers at the Actor\u2019s Hour explicit instructions not to mention Weinstein in their sets. But Bachman, who wrote in her op-ed that she is a three-time survivor of rape, had no interest in staying silent while Weinstein sat before her. And that was how comedy turned into something else: When Bachman mentioned him during her set, she was punished for saying what was plain.\n\nThe Downtime show functioned, in the end, as a kind of morality play in reverse. It was a lesson in how easy it is, still, for someone like Harvey Weinstein to move through the world at once thoroughly disgraced and vigorously defended. The scene served as a reminder that, despite the #MeToo movement\u2019s revelations and reckonings, regression is its own kind of force. This was heckling used not in the typical manner\u2014a less-powerful person, demanding a say\u2014but instead in the opposite. This was heckling done in defense of the powerful.\n\nHere is one of the definitions the Oxford English Dictionary offers for heckle, the verb: \u201cTo question (a politician, witness, etc.) thoroughly and persistently, esp. in order to test the strength of his or her position or statements.\u201d That idea carries a certain nobility: Heckling, functioning as an arbiter. The notion posits a fundamental equality between the heckler and the hecklee. It suggests the Socratic. The heckling carried out against Kelly Bachman, though, conveys precisely the inverse idea: It was angry. It was incurious. It was partisan\u2014not in a political sense, but in a moral one. And it was interested, as backlash always will be, in protecting the status quo.\n\nWhen the revelations about Weinstein broke, around this time in 2017, many people met the news not only with shock, but also with a kind of knowingness. They talked about open secrets\u2014about the way Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior had been treated, for years, with a slippery irony: as a known unknown, as another strain of alternative fact. Two years later, Weinstein\u2019s appearance in a space meant for young performers\u2014and the boos that greeted the woman who dared to object to it\u2014suggests a new iteration of open secret that is, in its way, even more pernicious than the last. There is at this point, even as Weinstein awaits trial for a small percentage of the allegations against him, an obviousness to his monstrosity. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a Weinstein is a defense that #MeToo detractors often invoke on behalf of those who are accused of\u2014merely, the detractor will often add\u2014groping, or harassing, or abusing their power. But even Weinstein, the Actor\u2019s Hour episode proved, enjoys ongoing impunity: protected in public spaces, his comfort prioritized over that of everyone else.", "description": "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s detractors were told to \u201cshut up.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s hecklers were dismissed as \u201cun-American.\u201d What are the men\u2019s defenders so afraid of?", "authors": ["Megan Garber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_136496220/facebook.jpg?1572448999", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
