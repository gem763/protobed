Basically, they have chosen this opportunity to kick him up the backside.\n\nTo be honest, I admired the fact he dug his heels in last winter. He'd worked hard on his wicketkeeping and he was angry when he was selected as a specialist batsman. But if you go down that road, it is imperative when you get the gloves back that you put in some performances.\n\nEspecially when there is competition for places. One thing England do not lack is wicketkeeper-batsman options.\n\nOne confusing element to the squad, though, is that I can't say that Jos Buttler is a better keeper than Jonny Bairstow. I don't believe he is. Buttler might not even be Lancashire's second-choice keeper if he were to play county cricket. Sure, maybe leave Bairstow out for a better keeper like Ben Foakes. But this switch?\n\nOne confusing element is I can't say that Buttler is a better wicketkeeper than Bairstow\n\nBairstow averaged 23.77 as a wicketkeeper-batsman in the recently-concluded Ashes series; Buttler 24.7 as a batsman. Buttler would no doubt argue that he got stuck with the tail a few times but that goes with the territory of batting at number seven. It doesn't add up.\n\nThere are a few anomalies in this squad selection, actually. Last Friday, the ECB gave Bairstow a Test central contract. Then, just 72 hours later, they don't pick him for the very next Test match.\n\nA time to re-set. A time for reflection. A time to re-charge. However you dress it up, by leaving him back in Yorkshire you are opening the door to other people during those two matches in November.\n\nI have always said that, with any selection you make, you should be looking at what might happen one step down the line. Take Craig Overton, for the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford.\n\nThey picked him and left Chris Woakes out, even though Woakes' bowling statistics in English conditions are magnificent. Then, they picked a tour squad for which they left out Overton, and went for Woakes, whose stats away from home are abysmal.\n\nBairstow had the chance to prove the selectors wrong but didn't manage to take it\n\nThey have either got the initial Overton selection wrong, Woakes' winter pick wrong, or arguably both.\n\nWhat I don't like is making one-off selections for Tests, something I have felt this particular England selection panel do. In any selection you make, think of the repercussions.\n\nEd Smith clearly takes a different view. He tries to analyse selection in every single game but that can over-complicate things and promote short-termism. It is then hard to make longer-term judgments on where the side is.\n\nThey've probably seen this as an opportunity 'to have a look at people'. It's not a saying I have ever liked. Once you get selected for England it's because people believe you are an international player, based on what you have shown in county cricket.\n\nBy the same token, when you are dropped it's because the selectors no longer believe you are performing to Test standard.\n\nThis is also a squad that is moving in a slightly different direction. They're probably seeing the relative success of someone like Rory Burns, who despite averaging only 29.25 in Test cricket applied himself against that high-quality Australia attack pretty well this summer.\n\nYou can't ignore the runs Zak Crawley has made but I can't see how he plays in the first Test\n\nHe is someone who had struck a lot of runs in first-class cricket over the previous five seasons and they are moving away from the experiment of promoting white-ball players like Jason Roy - because it didn't work.\n\nWho have been the batsmen who have been clocking the runs up in the Championship? The ones who can't be ignored? Ollie Pope, when not injured, has been phenomenal in the middle order and Dominic Sibley has been exactly the same at the very top.\n\nIf you are going to believe in county cricket, you can't ignore the runs those two have made. They probably have a bit of a gut feel on Zak Crawley, and that he's worth a punt, but I can't see how he plays in the first Test of the series. Selecting him as another top-order option suggests they might not be 100% convinced on Sibley.\n\nThis is their time. Bairstow should use his to seek advice. For such a high-quality player, he gets bowled out a lot. He's stubborn; believing nothing is wrong makes him the cricketer he is; but he does need to address some technical issues.\n\nHe has always been a real fighter, someone who lives to prove people wrong. He must take this chance to do exactly that.", "description": "NASSER HUSSAIN: Jonny Bairstow can have little to complain about when it comes to his omission from England's Test tour squad for New Zealand.", "authors": ["Nasser Hussain For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/20/18840160-0-image-a-37_1569266792191.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
