In exchange, Neumann must give up much of his voting rights and his role as chairman. The deal also reportedly removes the two co-CEOs who took over a few weeks ago, both of whom were hired under Neumann\u2019s watch.\n\nRead: In leaked email, WeWork cofounder Miguel McKelvey tells employees \u2018it takes fortitude to continue to believe\u2019\n\nClaure is to be named interim chairman and to lead a search for a new CEO.\n\nClaure is the COO of Softbank Group, the publicly traded holding company built Masayoshi Son and one of Son\u2019s most trusted lieutenants. Claure is also the CEO of Softbank Group International.\n\nMost people know Claure as the man Softbank installed as CEO of Sprint, who turned that wireless company around after Softbank\u2019s major investment.\n\nBut his career and his life story are far more spectacular than that.\n\nClaure was born in La Paz, Bolivia. He came to the US in 1989 to attend college in Massachusetts. A fated airline trip turned into his big break.\n\ncaption La Paz, Bolivia source Flickr/Adam Jones, Ph.D.\n\nClaure was always entrepreneurial, even as a kid, and made extra cash by buying and selling his mother\u2019s clothing outside their house.\n\nAfter completing his degree in economics and finance at Bentley College, Claure found himself on a plane sitting next to the newly-appointed Bolivian Football Federation president.\n\nBy the time the flight landed, he landed a job as head of business operations. The team qualified for the World Cup that year, 1994, the first time in 44 years.\n\nClaure told the South Miami Harold in 2013 that he learned from the federation president Guido Loayza, \u201cHis persistence against all odds was an eye opener.\u201d\n\nAfter the World Cup, he moved back to Boston. He needed cash so he answered an ad that promised cash for frequent flier miles, selling them for $2,000.\n\nA few days later, when he needed to fly back to Bolivia, he called up that company and tried to buy his miles back.\n\nThey wanted $8,000. A 400% markup in a matter of days! That kind of profit attracted him to start his own gray market business of selling airline miles.\n\nThe airlines tried to tell him he couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\u201cBut we found a way to do it legally,\u201d Marcelo told Inc. back in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt taught me that you don\u2019t have to do what people tell you, no matter how powerful they are. A lot of times, we live by the limits that are given to us, and it stunts our potential,\u201d he said.\n\nHe says he got into the wireless phone business when he walked into a shop to buy a phone and a \u201cfed up\u201d business owner offered to give him a phone if he bought into the business instead.\n\ncaption Marcelo Claure source CNBC/screen capture\n\nSo, he did and within a few years, he had built that stake into the leading wireless retailer in New England, he told the South Florida Journal back in 2013.\n\nIn 1995, he figured out another loophole to turn into a business, this time with mobile phones.\n\ncaption Motorola flip phone source Carlo Allegri/Reuters\n\nAs a result of running that wireless business, he figured out that mobile phone maker Motorola priced its cell phones far cheaper in Canada than it did in the US.\n\nSo he convinced Bell Canada to buy extra phones and sell them to his company, which he sold to US retailers at a profit, still undercutting Motorola\u2019s US prices.\n\nMotorola was not pleased, although the company would later become Claure\u2019s biggest business partner.\n\nHis most successful company, Brightstar, was launched when he and his team found a bigger niche: helping mobile phone makers distribute their phones to Latin American telephone companies.\n\nThe phone makers disliked dealing with all the customs regulations and the phone companies liked having a partner that could quickly fill phone orders.\n\nMotorola partnered with Brightstar and saw its Latin American sales zoom.\n\n\u201cThe secret was,\u201d Marcelo told Inc. in 2004, \u201cthat I changed the rules of distribution.\u201d\n\nBy 2013, Brightstar was generating $7 billion a year in revenue, and $260 million a year in profits and had caught the eye of Japanese telecom mogul Masayoshi Son.\n\ncaption SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son source Getty Images AsiaPac\n\nMasayoshi Son, who\u2019s own wealth arose from the wireless telecom business, bought a majority stake in Brightstar for $1.26 billion in 2014, leaving Claure with a 47% stake.\n\nSoftbank agreed to slowly buy more of Claure\u2019s stake, Reuters reported. Brightstar is still a part of Softbank\u2019s portfolio.\n\nIn 2014, Son asked Claure to step in and fix Sprint. So he did.\n\nSoftbank bought Sprint, the struggling No. 3 carrier, in 2013 for $21.6 billion.\n\nSon hand-selected Claure to be CEO and turn the company around. He spent four years as CEO rejuvenating the company\u2019s fortunes by cutting expenses and improving the brand\u2019s reputation.\n\nSprint went from losing customers to gaining more than 2.1 million, and Claure orchestrated a merger of Sprint with T-Mobile.\n\nSo far, that deal has faced endless roadblocks but the companies are still working on it.\n\nIn 2018, Claure moved from CEO to executive chairman and became COO of Softbank.\n\nDuring his time at sprint, Claure revamped the company\u2019s marketing. He will forever be known for greenlighting the Helicopter Trampoline campaign with YouTube star Jake Paul.\n\nThe stunt, where Paul jumped on a trampoline hanging from a helicopter, was the brainchild of internet marketing pro Jason Neubauer.\n\nIn addition to his roles at Sprint and Softbank, Claure oversees the SoftBank Innovation Fund, launched in March, which plans to invest $5 billion in Latin America startups\n\nHere he is telling CNBC about the new fund:\n\nHe is known as Bolivia\u2019s richest person and may be a billionaire himself.\n\nsource Wikipedia/Mattkholland\n\nBack in 2014, when he sold a stake to Softbank, his net worth was estimated to be more than $900 million. And his fortunes under SoftBank have only improved.\n\nThe 6-foot, 6-inch tall Claure is the father of six children and owns in a waterfront mansion in Miami Beach.\n\nsource pisaphotography/Shutterstock\n\nHis Miami waterfront mansion was formerly owned by Miami Heat legend Rony Seikaly, and in 2017 was put on the rental market for $60,000 a month, The RealDeal reported.\n\nIt\u2019s a 9,400 Mediterranean-style home with nine bedrooms, nine baths and two half-baths.\n\nBut his personal life is just as busy as his professional life. Claure hangs with David Beckham as a co-owner and leader of two soccer teams.\n\ncaption Inter Miami CF owners including Marcelo Claure (far left) and David Beckham source Inter Miami CF\n\nClaure is part owner and chairman of Inter Miami CF, which is David Beckham\u2019s new major league soccer team scheduled to start playing in March, 2020.\n\nHe\u2019s also the chairman of Club Bolivar, Bolivia\u2019s top soccer team.\n\nThat means Claure is buddies with co-owner Beckham. The other owners of the team include MasTec\u2019s Jorge Mas and Jose Mas and Claure\u2019s boss and friend SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.\n\nClaure made a name for himself as a tech philanthropist early in his career. He was, for instance, a founding member of the 2005-era One Laptop Per Child project.\n\nOLPC created a low-cost green laptop and gave them away to the world\u2019s poorest children in developing nations. It gave away around 3 million laptops in the ten years that it was going strong, the Verge reports.\n\nIn 2016, while at Sprint, Claure created the 1Million Project Foundation to connect disadvantaged communities to the internet.\n\nHe\u2019s also a surfer, recently tweeting about adding a surfing trip to Costa Rica to his bucket list.\n\nHeard #CostaRica has some of the best waves for surfing. I\u2019m putting the destination on my bucket list. ???? #NationalSurfingDay pic.twitter.com/6mnyAxi5aZ \u2014 MarceloClaure (@marceloclaure) October 19, 2019\n\nHe is also a marathon runner, training with a group of people from Sprint. Recently he vowed to run the NYC Marathon with a group of friends to raise money for five charities.\n\nsource Unstoppable team\n\nThe charities involve projects to the clean oceans, children\u2019s hospitals and Reporters Without Borders. The group put together a website to encourage donations.\n\nAlthough Claure is ambitious and seemingly tireless, people who know him says he doesn\u2019t have to pretend to the be the smartest person in the room.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to show you he\u2019s the smartest guy in the room by talking,\u201d one of his Brightstar business partners said of him to Inc. back in 2004. \u201cHe shows you by the kind of people he hires and his belief in them.\u201d\n\nA lawyer named Clay Parker who worked with both Brightstar and Claure for more than 20 years told the Miami Herald in 2018:\n\n\u201cMarcelo wants to be king of the world,\u201d and that his view is \u201cif he works hard, he can accomplish it.\u201d\n\nHe told the South Florida Business Journal much the same thing: that he attributes his success to \u201chard work and determination.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - He owns two soccer teams, hangs with David Beckham and is known as one of the richest men from Latin America..
