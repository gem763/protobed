Modern armies have been bound by the \u201claw of armed conflict\u201d since 1949. The Geneva Conventions is the only international treaty that all nations signed, and many have incorporated its principles into their own domestic law.\n\nThe Protocol Additional (1977) clarifies the nuances of armed conflict, essentially incorporating non-international armed conflict into the limits on the use of force highlighted in the Geneva Conventions. This was an essential move, because most of the conflict of the Cold War and the \u201cdirty little wars\u201d of the 21st century are of non-international character. Up to that point, the Geneva Conventions covered only international armed conflict. Though several countries, including the United States, have not ratified the Protocol Additional, all note that it\u2019s evidence of customary international law and routinely follow its parameters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo country ever has quit this important international paradigm until Russia\u2019s announcement on Thursday. Putin\u2019s decision is a troublesome addition to the movement away from various international legal regimes that promote peace and security, a hallmark of the tenets of the United Nations. In this evident \u201cAge of the Strongman,\u201d the movement away from a global approach to the rule of law is overshadowed by populist and nationalistic views in many parts of the world.\n\nThe rule of law stabilizes the interaction of states; it enhances peace and security, and encourages stable global trade, financial and information systems that benefit all. Despite this, a majority of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have blocked and weakened U.N. efforts to perform its mandate \u2014 and even have mocked and prevented the International Criminal Court from seeking justice for victims of atrocity crimes.\n\nWith a weakened European Union, there is no single power that promotes human rights values in a consistent way. The EU simply does not have the geopolitical horsepower to affect outcomes that elevate international peace and security. Even NATO seems to be rotting from within. The appearance of weakness by this central security organization only emboldens the strongman who has led Russia for two decades. Putin apparently no longer fears any international sanctions on his moves to become the major player in Russia\u2019s sphere of influence. His withdrawal from Protocol I shows his utter disdain for international law.\n\nThis, and other actions outlined here, cast the shadow of a gathering storm that\u2019s beginning to spread across the globe.\n\nIn some ways, the U.N. Security Council permanent members \u2014 Russia, China and the United States \u2014 are holding the rest of the world hostage to a new world order that likely was not contemplated just three years ago. We have gone \u201cback to the future,\u201d so to speak, setting up a geopolitical paradigm similar to the 1930s, which resulted in the advent of World War II. Even then, the \u201csleeping giant\u201d \u2014 the United States \u2014 fought its way, with the rest of the world, out of the gale-force winds of tyranny and led the world toward stability under the rule of law. Sadly, the United States no longer projects that sense of belief in an international community bound together to promote free trade, the sharing of ideas, and world order under the law. This could be fatal.\n\nThe British statesman Winston Churchill, in his book \u201cThe Gathering Storm,\u201d declared: \u201cVirtuous motives, trammelled by inertia and timidity, are no match for armed and resolute wickedness.\u201d Have we lost the post-World War II resolve to settle disputes peaceably under international law? Is the international community now too timid to face up to apparent resolute wickedness that appears to be showing itself today?\n\nDavid M.
