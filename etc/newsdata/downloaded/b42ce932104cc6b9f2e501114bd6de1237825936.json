To win GOP-leaning states like Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia, Democrats can\u2019t afford to have an outspoken liberal as the face of the party. These states are uniquely sensitive to the ideological positioning of candidates. Moderates, like Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have shown the ability to win in tough circumstances. Meanwhile, an analysis by Third Way found that the only two swing-district Democrats whose campaigns or surrogates ran ads promoting government-run health care in 2018 were Kara Eastman in Nebraska and Dana Balter in New York\u2014who both lost despite the Democratic wave.\n\nAsked if a progressive candidate like Elizabeth Warren could hurt downballot Democrats, Senate Majority PAC president J.B. Poersch responded on C-SPAN\u2019s Newsmakers: \u201cIt feels as if voters are looking for an alternative to Donald Trump, and I think they\u2019ll find it in this process.\u201d The generic assurance wasn\u2019t exactly a ringing endorsement of Warren\u2019s potential coattails.\n\nPrivately, Democratic strategists are more anxious, worried that any presidential nominee\u2019s calls for Medicare-for-All and the decriminalization of border crossings will be damaging in the Republican-leaning states where so many pivotal Senate races will be fought. Red-state Senate candidates are currently able to promote poll-tested platitudes about their views on health care and immigration. They\u2019ll find themselves constantly on the defensive if the socialist-minded musings of Warren and Bernie Sanders become the official Democratic Party doctrine.", "description": "", "authors": ["Josh Kraushaar", "Nationaljournal.Com S Unlock"], "top_image": ""}
