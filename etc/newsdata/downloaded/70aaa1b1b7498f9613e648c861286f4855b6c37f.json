Five years without going to stadiums. People don\u2019t deserve to suffer.\u2019\n\nFour Bulgarian fans have since been detained and questioned by police over their involvement.\n\nUEFA has charged the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) for the racist behaviour and the throwing of objects from home fans.\n\nBorislav Mihaylov also resigned as president of the BFU after the prime minister, Boyko Borissov, called for his departure in the aftermath of the match.\n\nReferee Ivan Bebek spoke with Gareth Southgate and Tyrone Mings after the match was halted (PA Wire)\n\nMeanwhile, Tyrone Mings explained the process England\u2019s players went through after hearing the abuse.\n\n\u2018I went to Harry Kane first. He spoke to the manager, who then spoke to the fourth officials. Everyone was aware of it but we ultimately let our football do the talking and didn\u2019t get distracted by anything,\u2019 said the Aston Villa centre-back.\n\n\u2018Just before the end of the first half the appropriate next step was to return to the changing room. We made a common-sense decision to play the remaining few minutes and decided at half-time.\n\n\u2018Everybody made the decision. The manager, the team, the supporting staff. We spoke about it at half-time and we dealt with it and escalated it in the right way.\n\n\u2018I am proud of how we dealt with it and took the appropriate steps. I could hear it as clear as day. It doesn\u2019t affect me too much. I feel more sorry for those people who feel they have to have those opinions.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Hristo Stoichkov was reduced to tears in response to the racist abuse which Bulgaria's fans aimed at England's players during their Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday evening.
