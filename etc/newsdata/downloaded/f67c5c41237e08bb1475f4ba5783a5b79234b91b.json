The average selling price of homes rose to \u00a3291,968, from \u00a3284,937.\n\nHowever its operating margin - the amount of profit it makes per pound of revenue after some costs - fell to 21 per cent from 22.1 per cent, the company said.\n\nThe results sent Bellway shares falling 7 per cent to \u00a332.51 in morning trading.\n\nWhile uncertainty around Brexit could 'pose a threat to consumer confidence', Bellway also said: 'The one-off benefit to the operating margin from Nine Elms will not be repeated and in addition, in the absence of house price inflation, industrywide build cost pressures will continue to have a moderating effect.\n\n'As a result of these combined influences, the reduction to a consistent, underlying operating margin will be more pronounced.'\n\nHousebuilders have had a happy run for the past few years thanks to rising house prices, low interest rates, a competitive mortgage market and government subsidy in the form of the Help to Buy scheme.\n\nHowever more recently, building costs have started to rise faster than house prices as a weaker pound has made materials more expensive and Brexit concerns have hit the housing market, especially in the capital.\n\n'Today's results from Bellway demonstrate that this golden age could be drawing to a close,' said Russ Mould at AJ Bell.\n\n'House price inflation is stalling and, combined with an increase in build costs, this is beginning to put margins under pressure.'\n\n'At Bellway this looks set to be exacerbated as sales of freeholds on flats, particularly in London, dry up, as the company is forced to offer more part-exchange deals to maintain volumes and as it shifts focus from London and Home Counties.'\n\nBrexit preparations: Bellway said it has has been in 'close contact' with its suppliers in Europe, who have considered alternative trade routes to bring goods into the UK\n\nHowever, he said Bellway deserved credit 'for continuing on a growth path in the face of the pressured returns and for not compromising on build quality as a short-term fix to maintain margins'.\n\nIn terms of Brexit preparations, Bellway said it has been in 'close contact' with its suppliers on the continent from whom it buys goods like electrical appliances and ceramic tiles.\n\n'We have forecast our material requirements for the coming year and communicated these to our suppliers.\n\n'In turn, they have considered alternative trade routes to bring goods into the UK and have increased their stock levels to ensure that they have materials available in the event of delays through ports.'", "description": "Housebuilder Bellway has posted another rise in annual profits but warned that a slowdown in house price growth and higher building costs will squeeze margins further.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
