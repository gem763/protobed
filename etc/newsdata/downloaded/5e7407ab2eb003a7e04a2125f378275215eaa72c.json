REUTERS/Enrique Calvo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - A panel of bankers has ruled that some investors in Thomas Cook\u2019s (TCG.L) credit derivatives worth as much as $2.7 billion are eligible for a payout following the world\u2019s oldest tour operator\u2019s collapse on Monday.\n\nThe Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees (DC) said in a statement posted on its website on Tuesday that its EMEA panel had determined at a meeting on Monday that a bankruptcy credit event had occurred.\n\nThat ruling by the DC, which is made up of representatives from big banks, means that most holders of Credit Default Swaps (CDS), instruments used to insure exposure to credit, will get paid for their bets against the company.\n\nThe weekly gross notional value for Thomas Cook\u2019s CDS was $2.69 billion, according to the Depositary Trust & Clearing Corp (DTCC).\n\nThe ruling applies to credit derivative transactions with a scheduled termination date on or after Sept. 23 and doesn\u2019t apply to transactions with a termination date of Sept. 20, the statement said.\n\nThe judgement comes after hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers were stranded on Monday by the demise of the company, sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.\n\nThe liquidation marks the end of a British company that started in 1841 running local rail excursions and grew to pioneer the family package holiday.", "description": "A panel of bankers has ruled that some investors in Thomas Cook's credit derivatives worth as much as $2.7 billion are eligible for a payout following the world's oldest tour operator's collapse on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433259807&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0IJ", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
