The find provides evidence that early Paleolithic people saved the bones for as long as nine weeks before eating them.\n\n\u201cBone marrow constitutes a significant source of nutrition and as such was long featured in the prehistoric diet,\u201d Professor Ran Barkai said in a statement obtained by Fox News. \u201cUntil now, evidence has pointed to immediate consumption of marrow following the procurement and removal of soft tissues. In our paper, we present evidence of storage and delayed consumption of bone marrow at Qesem Cave.\u201d\n\nANCIENT MAYANS CAUSED THEIR OWN 'CLIMATE CHANGE,' SHOCKING STUDY SAYS\n\nRuth Blasco, the study's lead author, said the practice may have been related to the early humans' social and economic statuses.\n\n\u201cThis is the earliest evidence of such behavior and offers insight into the socioeconomics of the humans who lived at Qesem,\u201d Blasco added. \u201cIt also marks a threshold for new modes of Paleolithic human adaptation.\u201d\n\nExperts previously believed that people who lived during the Paleolithic era were \"hunter gatherers who lived hand-to-mouth,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe researchers found that the bones were used as \"cans,\" which were able to preserve the marrow for a long period of time. They were covered with skin for a period of weeks, which \"enabled early humans to break the bone when necessary and eat the still nutritious bone marrow,\u201d Blasco continued.\n\n\u201cPrehistoric humans brought to the cave selected body parts of the hunted animal carcasses,\u201d one of the study's co-authors, Jordi Rosell, explained. \u201cThe most common prey was fallow deer, and limbs and skulls were brought to the cave while the rest of the carcass was stripped of meat and fat at the hunting scene and left there.\"\n\nRosell continued: We found that the deer leg bones, specifically the metapodials, exhibited unique chopping marks on the shafts, which are not characteristic of the marks left from stripping fresh skin to fracture the bone and extract the marrow.\u201d\n\nThe study has been published in the Oct. 9 issue of Science Advances.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Experts have uncovered shocking evidence of humans eating animal bone marrow from nearly 400,000 years ago.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/tel-aviv-bone-marrow-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
