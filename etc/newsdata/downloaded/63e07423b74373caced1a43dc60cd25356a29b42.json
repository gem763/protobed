Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., last week responded to backlash after she told Detroit police to hire only black facial recognition analysts, writing in a scathing op-ed that her comments were neither \u201cracist\u201d nor \u201cinappropriate\u201d and pushed further for a total ban of the technology used to identify criminal suspects.\n\nDETROIT POLICE CHIEF PUSHES BACK AGAINST RASHIDA TLAIB'S SUGGESTION TO ONLY HIRE BLACK FACIAL RECOGNITION ANALYSTS\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call out every injustice I see. It\u2019s probably what makes most people uncomfortable when I speak the truth,\u201d Tlaib wrote in an op-ed in The Detroit News. \u201cMy comments weren\u2019t racist, out of order, or \u201cinappropriate.\u201d It is inappropriate to implement a broken, flawed and racist technology that doesn\u2019t recognize black and brown faces in a city that is over 80% black.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was elected to serve my residents, and I cannot in good conscience sit by while inaccurate facial recognition technology is deployed in ways that run the risk of false arrests and over-policing,\u201d she continued. \u201cFacial recognition technology will have racist results and relying on human analysts for intervention is inadequate. We need to ban facial recognition.\u201d\n\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig, who is black, said last week that it was appalling for the Democratic \u201cSquad\u201d member to suggest that only black people should be hired as facial recognition analysts.\n\nIn an editorial titled \"Rashida Tlaib should wake up,\" The Deroit News wrote: \u201cIt's almost too rich that the congresswoman who was a target of one of Donald Trump's most offensive tweets has followed him down the racist rabbit hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cRacism can rise from a lot of places, including from those who build their careers railing against it. Tlaib, who considers herself among Congress' most woke members, should wake up to that reality,\u201d the paper's editorial said.\n\nTlaib's suggestion came during a tour of the Detroit Police Department's Real Time Crime Center, where the department uses facial recognition technology to locate suspects. Craig was showing Tlaib how the software works, and how analysts use it to identify and locate individuals. The department had extended the invitation to Tlaib after she tweeted them, calling facial recognition technology \"bulls---.\"\n\n\"Analysts need to be African-Americans, not people that are not,\" Tlaib said. \"It's true, I think non-African-Americans think African-Americans all look the same!\" She also cited instances where she witnessed people confuse Reps. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Elijah Cummings, D-Md.\n\nIn response to The Detroit News editoiral, Tlaib criticized the newspaper for taking the bait to allow the police chief \u201cto distract from the fact that broken technology is being used to lock up black and brown people in Detroit.\u201d (Tlaib's response was also published in The Detroit News.)\n\n\n\n\u201cCraig's department spent millions of dollars on a system that is flawed and jeopardizes our civil liberties, and it was implemented with no public input. Calling out racism isn\u2019t racist \u2014 but this technology is,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope instead of attacking me in the media he will read the studies I have provided to his department.\u201d\n\n\n\nTlaib also claimed during her police tour last week that \"the error rate among African-Americans, especially women,\" was 60 percent. In an appearance on \"Fox & Friends: First,\" Craig refuted the freshman congresswoman's claims.\n\n\"It's a software. It's biometrics,\" he said. \"And, to put race in it ... we're talking about trained professionals. My staff goes through intense training with the FBI, and so they're not looking at race but it's measurements. We were appalled when she made this statement,\" the police chief said.\n\n\"This is a double standard,\" Craig said. \"If I had made the exact same comment, they would've been calling for my resignation and she would have been leading that charge. That's a fact.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"We know [there are] flaws in the technology. We've addressed that through the rigorous system that we have in place. So, we have a modeled approach on how we use this technology very effectively,\" he said.", "description": "Rep.
