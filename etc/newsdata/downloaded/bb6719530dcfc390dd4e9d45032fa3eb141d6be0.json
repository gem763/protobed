The court statement says the businessman offered the hitman 2 million Chinese yuan, or $282,600 in today's dollars, for the job.\n\nXi Guangan took the money and contracted a second hitman, Mo Tianxiang, paying him 1 million yuan to kill Wei, the court says.\n\nThe court says the second hitman then hired another hitman, Yang Kangsheng, paying him 270,000 yuan up front and an additional 500,000 yuan when the deed was done.\n\nYang Kangsheng is accused of offering a similar deal to a fourth hitman, Yang Guasheng, paying him 200,000 yuan up front and an additional 500,000 yuan after the job was complete.\n\nThe fourth hitman hired the fifth \u2014 and final \u2014 hitman, Ling Xiansi, who agreed to do the job for 100,000 yuan, according to the reports. But instead of going through with the murder, Ling met with Wei and told him about the target on his back, offering the opportunity to fake Wei's death rather than actually killing him.\n\nThe fifth hitman helped Wei stage his death, Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Wei was bound and gagged in photos, and Ling sent the photos to his employer. The news traveled up the chain of subcontractors up to the original client, Tan.\n\nAfter the photos of Wei were taken, however, the police were notified, according to ABC.\n\nTan was sentenced to five years in prison, while the five hitmen were sentenced between two and four years of prison time, according to CNN.\n\nNOW WATCH: Why Venice floods every year", "description": "The job went through five hitmen before the fifth hitman struck a deal with the victim to fake his death instead of killing him.", "authors": ["Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yq7Dq_6YLuMu14rq8P6wFA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz02MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/696793b9c7f60f60d95eb0ffe1675b31", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
