And, showing their own relative moderation, nearly all of them did it by charging that Warren\u2019s plans were too big, too expensive and, when it comes to paying for them, too vague.\n\nThe only person who got beat up more than she was President Trump. For her part, Warren seemed taken aback, but never lost her cool.\n\nThe pounding on her was especially acute over her repeated refusal to say whether her Medicare-for-all plan would result in middle-class tax hikes. Asked directly by a moderator, Warren said, \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d then proceeded to obfuscate, duck and dodge until her time was up.\n\nThe exchange was one of several that revealed what the polls have been showing: Biden is slowly sagging and likely faces more trouble over his son\u2019s profiteering from Joe\u2019s days as vice president.\n\nWarren, meanwhile, is growing in strength, both nationally and in the early states. And she stands to benefit the most when Bernie Sanders leaves the race, with his recent heart attack likely ending any long-shot hope he had of winning the nomination.\n\nIndeed, Warren is on such a roll that her rivals spent most of the night trying to poke holes in her momentum.\n\nIt was left to Beto O\u2019Rourke to identify what I regard as a key liability of Warren\u2019s campaign, namely her obvious desire to use the power of the presidency to punish rather than help. There\u2019s something stridently negative about that and I\u2019m only surprised that O\u2019Rourke was the one to point it out.\n\nHe began the sequence by saying she didn\u2019t seem interested in \u201clifting people up.\u201d Instead, he said, she is \u201cmore interested in being punitive and pitting one part of the country against another.\u201d\n\nBingo. That insight captures Warren\u2019s finger-wagging demand that everyone \u201cunderstand\u201d what she knows about the evil nature of corporations, whether it\u2019s Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Banks or Wall Street.\n\nHer passion never seems to be about the benefits of her plans, only the virtue of singling out wrongdoers for \u201caccountability.\u201d\n\nAnd anybody who doesn\u2019t agree with her is part of the problem, as she demonstrated when she got little support for a wealth tax. Using sweeping gestures to include her rivals, she accused them of thinking it\u2019s \u201cmore important to protect billionaires\u201d than help the middle class.\n\nThe harsh spotlight on Warren benefited Biden and may be one of the reasons why he had one of his best debate performances. He seemed more relaxed, and although he still mangled his words and numbers several times, he was passionate about denouncing the slaughter of the Kurds in Syria.\n\nHis main calling card is that he \u201cgets things done,\u201d a point he made several times without actually mentioning Barack Obama. It\u2019s not clear if that was deliberate or a slip-of-the-mind mistake.\n\nThe evening began with a big fat softball from CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. He lobbed an impeachment question and \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 all 12 candidates think Trump is unfit, dishonest, terrible, corrupt, blah blah blah.\n\nBoob bait for the bubbas, as the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan described such exchanges.\n\nThe moment was the highlight for most of the stage, with the top-tier candidates rightly getting the bulk of the speaking time. Despite some complaints to the contrary, the debate proved that the party\u2019s qualifying rules were not strict enough.\n\nThe requirement for a 2 percent showing in the polls, which is statistically close to meaningless, meant there were too many candidates and the energy too diffused. It turns out there are good reasons why neither major party ever put as many as 12 candidates on a single stage.\n\nPlease, never again.\n\nOne consequence is that the debate was not as definitive as it could have been. Of course, it\u2019s still relatively early in the process \u2014 the Iowa caucus isn\u2019t until Feb. 3 \u2014 but the ideological split is not anywhere close to being resolved because so many candidates give the illusion of many choices.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a two-person race, but neither Biden nor Warren seems ready to unite the party. And it\u2019s getting close to being too late for a newcomer. Although Michael Bloomberg is said to be sniffing around again and Hillary Clinton is making noises, there is no draft movement for either one of them.\n\nRather, it\u2019s almost certain Dems will have to make a choice between Biden and Warren.
