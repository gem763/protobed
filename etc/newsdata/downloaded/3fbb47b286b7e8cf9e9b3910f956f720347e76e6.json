(Jonathan Alcorn/Reuters)\n\nThe Atlantic reporter\u2019s liberalism comes face-to-face with the radical left\u2019s transformation of American public education.\n\nFew journalists are as respected by, and respectable to, liberals as The Atlantic\u2019s George Packer. The author of The Assassin\u2019s Gate (2005), The Unwinding (2013), and a recently published biography of Richard Holbrooke, Our Man, Packer has written for bastions of liberal thought from the New York Times Magazine to The New Yorker in a distinguished, decades-long career. His latest piece for The Atlantic, \u201cWhen the Culture War Comes for the Kids,\u201d is essential reading.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy? Because it relates, in Packer\u2019s haunted and sympathetic style, the experience of having a child enrolled in a New York City school system corrupted by politics. For anyone who believes in individualism, the freedoms of speech and conscience, and the equal dignity of human beings, the experience sounds like a nightmare.\n\nThe summer before kindergarten, an official informed Packer that his son had made it off the wait list at their preferred public school. \u201cThis school squared the hardest circle,\u201d Packer writes. \u201cIt was a liberal white family\u2019s dream.\u201d He, his wife, and his son became invested in the institution. \u201cThe school\u2019s approach \u2014 the year-long second-grade unit on the geology and bridges of New York \u2014 caught his imagination, while the mix of races and classes gave him something even more precious: an unselfconscious belief that no one was better than anyone else, that he was everyone\u2019s equal and everyone was his.\u201d Then, Packer says, \u201cThings began to change.\u201d\n\nNo kidding. A new sort of left-wing cultural politics developed toward the close of the Obama presidency. \u201cAt the heart of the new progressivism was indignation, sometimes rage, about ongoing injustice against groups of Americans who had always been relegated to the outskirts of power and dignity.\u201d Theories of intersectionality and of \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d seeped into business, politics, media, and education. \u201cIts biggest influence came in realms more inchoate than policy: the private spaces where we think and imagine and talk and write, and the public spaces where institutions shape the contours of our culture and guard its perimeter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new progressivism, Packer observes, was \u201ca limited, elite phenomenon.\u201d Its avatars held postgraduate degrees, had lots of disposable income, and resided in fashionable neighborhoods. \u201cIt was as a father, at our son\u2019s school, that I first understood the meaning of the new progressivism, and what I disliked about it,\u201d he writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents opted their children out of standardized tests, which they deemed \u201cstructurally biased, even racist, because nonwhite students had the lowest scores.\u201d Without tests, there was no way to measure the progress of the student body. The school, without telling parents, changed all of its bathrooms, \u201cfrom kindergarten to fifth grade,\u201d from single-sex to gender-neutral. At a Parent\u2013Teacher Association meeting, families split into warring factions. One side was furious at the school for making such an important decision arbitrarily and autonomously. \u201cThe parents in the other camp argued that gender labels \u2014 and not just on the bathroom doors \u2014 led to bullying and that the real problem was the patriarchy. One called for the elimination of urinals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPacker\u2019s family was distraught by Donald Trump\u2019s election. He found, however, that the school had deprived his son of a vocabulary to understand and oppose Trump on the basis of liberal principles: \u201cBy age 10 he had studied the civilizations of ancient China, Africa, the early Dutch in New Amsterdam, and the Mayans. He learned about the genocide of Native Americans and slavery. But he was never taught about the founding of the republic.\u201d Packer notes that Richard Carranza, the far-left chancellor of New York City schools, mandated anti-bias instruction for school employees that categorized \u201cperfectionism,\u201d \u201cindividualism,\u201d \u201cobjectivity,\u201d and \u201cworship of the written word\u201d as hallmarks of \u201cwhite supremacy culture.\u201d\n\nPacker\u2019s article vividly describes the \u201cprogress\u201d critical race theory has made as it percolates through American public education. He is a man of the left disturbed by a rising generation of left-wing ideology and activism. It has happened before. When the New Left politics of Tom Hayden began appearing on university campuses in the 1960s, social democrats and anti-Communist liberals found themselves appalled. Irving Howe debated Hayden for hours. Norman Podhoretz, shocked by the anti-Americanism of \u201cthe Movement,\u201d moved right. \u201cA neoconservative,\u201d Irving Kristol quipped, \u201cis a liberal who has been mugged by reality.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPacker is too liberal, and too careful, to say whether he is willing to press charges against the corruption of American public education by radicals intent on social transformation. Time and again, radicals have displaced liberals only because the liberals, wracked with guilt, lack the will to stop them. \u201cWatching your children grow up gives you a startlingly vivid image of the world you\u2019re going to leave them,\u201d Packer writes. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m sanguine.\u201d\n\nNone of us should be.", "description": "The Atlantic reporter George Packer\u2019s liberalism has come face-to-face with the radical left\u2019s transformation of American public education.", "authors": ["Matthew Continetti", "David French", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kyle Smith", "Jim Geraghty", "Katherine Timpf", "The Editors", "Zachary Evans", "Read More", "The American Conservative"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/school-bus-los-angeles-2015.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
