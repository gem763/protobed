They provided the details for how it happened,\u201d Moore told host Joe Scarborough. \u201cWhat more is there that we need to do other than to have this impeachment as soon as possible? They think we can do this by the end of the year. By the end of the year? By Halloween. You know, what is the point of any investigation?\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIf the Democrats go to do Mueller 2, that ain\u2019t going to play well and they\u2019re going to lose the momentum that they need. It\u2019s so rare for us, Joe, to be this far ahead of ourselves that to let Trump and his people figure this out and try to catch up. These people are evil geniuses and they are not stupid, and I have ultimate respect for their ability to get away with anything.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Filmmaker Michael Moore during Wednesday's \"Morning Joe\" discussed the push for an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over his phone call | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/moore-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
