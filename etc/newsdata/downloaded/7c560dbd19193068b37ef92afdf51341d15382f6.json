That\u2019s because, behind the scenes, powerful ideological forces are urging Turkey\u2019s government to press its advantage.\n\nSo far, the Turkish government has styled its invasion as a war of necessity. In his October 15th Wall Street Journal editorial, Erdogan depicted the military offensive \u2014 ironically dubbed \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d \u2014 as the logical product of legitimate Turkish security concerns regarding lingering extremism and instability, and the persistent failure of Western leadership. \u201cThe international community,\u201d Erdogan argued, \u201cmissed its opportunity to prevent the Syrian crisis from pulling an entire region into a maelstrom of instability,\u201d so it should now support the Turkish government in its decision to intervene.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt home, however, Erdogan\u2019s supporters and aligned ideologues have been singing a significantly different \u2014 and more telling \u2014 tune. In assorted op-ed columns and media appearances, backers of the Turkish government\u2019s Syria strategy depicted the \u201cgreen light\u201d given to Erdogan by President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Veterans group backs lawsuits to halt Trump's use of military funding for border wall Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE as a historical moment in which their country should seize the initiative and impose its vision on the region.\n\nPerhaps the clearest example appeared in the pages of the conservative Yeni Safak daily, where columnist Ibrahim Karagul made the intellectual case for a revival of Turkish expansionism. \u201cA new and forceful step is going to be taken aimed at \u2018shaping the region and history,\u2019\u201d Karagul wrote. \u201cPatience has run out, warnings are over, preparations are complete\u201d for the invasion of northern Syria, as a result of which \u201cTurkey\u2019s power will kick into gear once again.\u201d\n\nThe message is unmistakable. If Karagul and other like-minded Erdogan enthusiasts have their way, Turkey\u2019s recent incursion into Syria would be just the start of a larger, and distinctly imperial, project.\n\nThat idea is hardly new. Turkish politicians have long propounded an outsized view of their country\u2019s regional presence \u2014 one rooted in its historic greatness. It did not take long after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire for the idea of \u201cgreater Turkey\u201d to be revived by Turkish nationalists, although its implementation was hampered by the dynamics of World War II and subsequently the Cold War. The concept received renewed attention, at least temporarily, after the collapse of the USSR provided Turkey an opportunity for expanded influence among the newly-independent nations of Central Asia and the Caucasus. In turn, this \u201cneo-Ottomanism\u201d has continued into the Erdogan era, with Turkey\u2019s president styling himself as a new sultan and even issuing maps that take a decidedly expansive view of the country\u2019s territorial holdings. Today, the strategic opening in Syria appears have revived that impulse anew.\n\nFor the time being, at least, the Turkish government seems content with the current status quo, through which it has succeeded in creating a long-coveted buffer zone on Syrian soil. But only time will tell whether the arrangement holds, or whether Ankara decides to once again press forward. Supporters of a \u201cgreater Turkey,\u201d at least, are certainly hoping it will. In various media outlets, Turkish ideologues are now arguing that their country\u2019s adventurism in Syria is simultaneously a vital contribution to European security and a blow to Western imperialism. Thus the consensus for further military action, if Erdogan deems it necessary, appears to be firmly in place.\n\nWhether that decision is taken depends greatly on just how deep the vision of an imperial Turkey truly runs among the Turkish president and his supporters.\n\nIlan Berman is senior vice president at the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington, D.C.
