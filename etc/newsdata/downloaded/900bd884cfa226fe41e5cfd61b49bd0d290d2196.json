But so was the iPhone X from two years ago. So we approached this review with a different lens: Instead of comparing it to last year\u2019s iPhone XS, we\u2019ve been using the 11 alongside iPhones that are two and three years old \u2014 the X and the 7. To measure the most important change, the cameras, we used a three-way selfie stick to make all the phones snap the same photo at the same time.\n\nWe were hard-pressed to find features we couldn\u2019t live without on the 11 \u2014 and surprised at how well the X has aged. Our takeaway: Anyone with an iPhone 7 (or older) will appreciate that the 11 shoots better photos in the dark, promises a longer battery life and has a larger screen. Otherwise, save your cash for next year, which will likely bring bigger changes like support for ultrafast 5G networks.\n\nApple\u2019s iOS 13 adds enough features that you may not need an iPhone 11\n\nOur three-year rule reflects the reality that many people are already holding off. In 2013, Americans bought new smartphones after 20 months, on average, according to research firm Kantar. As of this year, we\u2019re waiting 24.2 months.\n\nWhere did the two-year cycle come from anyway? In the U.S., phone carriers used to subsidize the cost of new phones with two-year service plans. Apple also used a naming system \u2014 4, 4S, 5, 5S \u2014 that suggested big improvements came in two-year cycles.\n\nBut the hardware breakthroughs haven\u2019t been rolling as fast lately. And Apple itself has made it easier to keep using old iPhones, with software updates for older models and by adding waterproofing and stronger glass. Cheaper battery replacements help, too.\n\nHelp Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question\n\nOf course, our rule is just a guide. It\u2019s okay to hold on to your iPhone even longer. Apple\u2019s latest iOS 13 update supports models going back to the four-year-old iPhone 6S. You might even decide to switch to an Android phone, though most people today are pretty locked in to a platform.\n\nWhat matters most isn\u2019t speeds and specs \u2014 or even a flashy third camera. Here\u2019s what an iPhone 11 or 11 Pro will actually feel like coming from the iPhone 7 and the iPhone X.\n\nThe camera\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words. But is it worth $1,000? Or even $700?\n\nWith our test trident shooting cameras simultaneously, we could clearly see improvements in the 11 over the 7 in lighting and color. But vs. the X? The changes are only dramatic in very specific photo situations.\n\nIn daytime shots \u2014 and even a few we took at happy hour \u2014 the 11 produced more detail than the 7 and X. But in some photos, we actually preferred the warmer tone of the X.\n\nIn the dark, a new Night Mode on the 11 and 11 Pro made a more dramatic difference, finding light and color in situations that even our eyes couldn\u2019t. It will appeal to anyone who has more than 1,000 Instagram followers.\n\nWhen the Night Mode activates (which happens automatically), the iPhone merges together a bunch of shots taken with different exposure lengths, taking the best, sharpest bits of each. That means you (and your subjects) have to hold really still \u2014 up to about 30 seconds \u2014 as the iPhone collects all those shots. How long you have to wait depends on how dark your scene is, and how much the iPhone senses your hand is shaking. (Using a tripod or bracing the phone against a wall helps.)\n\nHow about composing more interesting photos? The 11 doesn\u2019t offer anything new to help with our most practical camera need: zooming closer. The 11 Pro models include a lens with two-times optical zoom, but it\u2019s no more powerful than the one already on the X and even the 7 Plus. (We wish Apple had included the zoom lens on the regular 11 model, but it did not.)\n\nSo what about the new lens Apple is touting? All of the 11 models include an \u201cultrawide\u201d lens. Like looking through the peephole in a door, it lets you capture more with a 120-degree field of view. It\u2019s a creative tool that can be fun when you\u2019re very close to your subject. We\u2019re just not sure how often we\u2019ll actually make use of it.\n\nCamera aficionados take note: You might want to wait until Oct. 15, when Google is expected to unveil its Pixel 4; last year\u2019s model beat the camera competition with a low-light mode called \u201cNight Sight.\u201d And we don\u2019t yet have a read on the most curious new feature on the 11 Pro: a mode called \u201cDeep Fusion\u201d that promises to produce images with even better texture and tone. It\u2019s coming in a software upgrade and wasn\u2019t available to test.\n\nBattery life\n\nThe 11 promises some tremendous, life-altering battery improvements. But what that means for your upgrade is harder to say.\n\nApple says the iPhone 11 Pro can go four more hours than last year\u2019s iPhone XS before needing a recharge. How about vs. an iPhone 7? It won\u2019t say. Apple offers only this consistent data point: While playing a nonstop video, both the 7 and X lasts 13 hours; an 11 lasts 17. But that\u2019s hardly a real-life situation.\n\nNot all iPhones are the same. These cost less and are better for the Earth.\n\nWe\u2019ll need more time to verify this claim with our own battery tests. The smart geeks at Tom\u2019s Guide report in their own lab that the 11 performed about the same as last year\u2019s iPhone XR, lasting 11 hours and 20 minutes of continuous Web surfing over 4G. The larger 11 Pro Max lasted nearly 12 hours.\n\n(If battery life or the device\u2019s overall slowness are your main motivating factors for getting a new phone, consider getting your battery replaced before buying a new one.)\n\nFace ID\n\nWhen Apple skipped the iPhone 9 and jumped into letters with the iPhone X, it also jumped into the future. For anyone coming from a 7, you\u2019ll immediately notice:\n\n1. There\u2019s no more home button or fingerprint reader. Instead, you swipe up from the bottom of the phone and unlock with your face. Most people get used to it.\n\n2. The fancy face-detecting cameras also do a thing called Animojis, which map your face to let you pretend to be characters such as an octopus or smiling pile of excrement.\n\nOn the 11, you get one more feature not available in the X: You can take what Apple is calling a \u201cslofie,\u201d or a slow-motion video of your face. You of course could take a slow motion video of your face before using the back-facing camera, but this saves you the effort of rotation. Ah, innovation.\n\nSpeed and storage\n\nApple is beating the pants off the rest of the industry in the speed of the processor that\u2019s the brain of the phone.\n\nBut we had a hard time feeling it vs. the X. That year hit an inflection point for everyday functions. For example, tapping auto-adjust button in the Photos editing app took one second on a 7, 0.6 seconds on an X and 0.4 seconds on an 11.\n\nThere is one major spec upgrade since the 7 that you\u2019ll really feel: more storage. An entry-level iPhone 7 only came with 64 gigabytes of storage. The X and 11 both start at 64 gigabytes.\n\nDurability\n\nThe iPhone 7 was the first of the line to get waterproofing. The 11 is the first generation you could possibly take snorkeling. The 11 is water resistant up to two meters and the 11 Pro up to four meters. We\u2019re not sure that\u2019s going to move the ball for many people.\n\nApple also claims the glass covering the front and back of the 11 is stronger than on the X. We did not attempt throwing our review units on concrete. But we did miss the metal back on the 7, which doesn\u2019t shatter. The switch to a glass back on the X and later allows iPhones to charge wirelessly \u2014 a tech that still hasn\u2019t really caught on everywhere.\n\nShould you go Pro?\n\nSo you\u2019ve decided to upgrade. Which one do you buy?\n\nAnyone on a budget might do just fine with last year\u2019s model, the iPhone XR, which now sells for $600. It\u2019s got almost everything good about the $700 11, except for Night Mode, that wide-angle lens and this year\u2019s even-faster processor. Its battery life is still fantastic. If you\u2019ve got $100 to spare, Night Mode on the 11 alone is worth it.\n\nBut aren\u2019t you supposed to buy the \u201cbest\u201d iPhone? Apple tries to make that case with the \u201cPro\u201d name on the priciest models. (Who doesn\u2019t want to be a pro?) What you\u2019re really buying is that third, zoom lens. It\u2019s only available on the Pro and Pro Max.\n\nThe rest of the differences between the 11 and 11 Pro models can best be described with the shrug emoji. The Pro offers a slightly better, and brighter, screen. The 6.5-inch Pro Max version is the only way to max out your screen addiction, and also get the longest-lasting battery.\n\nReasons to buy nothing\n\nThere are some legitimate reasons you may want to hold onto your iPhone 7 or older. Mainly: whether you can physically hold onto it.\n\nApple\u2019s phones keep on getting larger. Sure, they need the extra space to cram in all the upgraded technology, but many people, especially those with smaller hands or shallow pockets, still like their phones petite. The iPhone 7 is both thinner and lighter than any phone that came after it. The iPhone SE, now only sold used or refurbished, is the only iPhone with a pocket friendly 4-inch screen.\n\nA $700 and up gadget is a serious investment. There is one bit of math to help you justify an upgrade: The longer you keep your phone, the lower its trade-in value. For example, Apple will only give you up to $150 to trade in an iPhone 7. An iPhone X, however, is worth up to $400 to the company.\n\nIf you\u2019ve just got to be seen walking around with not one, not two, but three camera lenses, we get it. Just promise you\u2019ll also donate to charity along with Apple. But you should also feel no pressure at all to buy the shiny new thing \u2014 and know you\u2019re not alone.\n\nRead more tech advice and analysis:\n\nRock this way: AirPods, Beats and Bose wireless ear buds take the headbang test\n\nYou watch TV.
