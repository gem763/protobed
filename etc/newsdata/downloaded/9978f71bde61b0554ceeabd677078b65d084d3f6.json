It\u2019s a pleasure palace for the rich, where nothing less than absolute perfection will suffice, and the motto, repeated to you daily, is \u2018the guest is God\u2019.\n\nOr perhaps you\u2019re a guest there, cosseted and pampered, your every wish anticipated.\n\nNow imagine that it has suddenly become irrelevant whether you\u2019re a guest or a waiter, because the place has been seized by terrorists armed with semi-automatic weapons and the sole question on your mind is how you are going to survive.\n\nNail-biting new film Hotel Mumbai re-imagines the events that happened almost 11 years ago when jihadi terrorists attacked one of India's grandest hotels, The Taj. Pictured, the hotel in flames in the movie\n\nHotel staff risked their lives to keep everyone as safe as possible and made unthinkable sacrifices to protect themselves and their families. Pictured, Nazanin Boniadi as Zahra, Dev Patel as Arjun and Armie Hammer playing David in the film\n\nSuch is the terrifying premise of the unforgettable film Hotel Mumbai, directed by Australian newcomer Anthony Maras.\n\nIt\u2019s based on the real-life events of late November 2008, when ten jihadi terrorists invaded the city of Mumbai, India, attacking railway stations, taxis and cafes.\n\nFour of the terrorists took possession of the iconic Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Fatalities among the 450 guests numbered at least 31, with countless more injured during three days of siege, until the terrorists were killed and the terrified captives were released.\n\nHotel Mumbai is a mixture of fact and fiction. Real footage is interspersed with the dramatic action.\n\nMost of the hotel\u2019s guests and staff are either fictional or amalgamations of several characters, the exception being the film\u2019s quiet hero, chef Hemant Oberoi (played by Bollywood legend Anupam Kher, recently seen on British TV in Mrs Wilson).\n\nThe trailer shows the star-studded cast trying to escape. The motion picture portrays the heroic actions of hotel staff as the business came under attack\n\nTen jihadi terrorists stormed the hotel in 2008 (pictured) and killed 31 people, including staff and guests. Pictured, the day the building was hit\n\nAlong with several of his staff, Oberoi risked his life to shepherd as many of the guests through the nightmare as he could.\n\nHe led them first to the exclusive club room The Chambers, deep within the hotel, then got them outside to safety, all the while treating them with as much dignity as if he were ushering them in to a gourmet meal at the restaurant.\n\n\u2018We could hear the blasts,\u2019 Oberoi has himself said of the night. \u2018But we didn\u2019t want the guests to panic. Some of them knew what was happening, some didn\u2019t.\n\n'But we wanted to ensure that they were calm and that we would take care of them. We lost so many young chefs that night \u2013 I can never forget them.\u2019\n\nFor Star Trek actor Jason Isaacs, who plays Russian hotel guest Vasili, it\u2019s the real-life heroism of Oberoi and his staff that distinguishes the film from more ordinary movie fare.\n\n\u2018The movie business has been creating uplifting stories forever, and we usually recognise how far they are from normal life experience,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018But here the real world threw up a perfect example of what we really are capable of as human beings \u2013 the extraordinary selflessness and generosity that these guys showed.\n\n\u2018Oddly, for a story in which such harrowing things happened, the film was incredibly positive to make.\n\nThe Indian police and army were ill-equipped to handle the assault in 2008. Pictured, a woman being rescued from inside the hotel on the day itself\n\n'We felt we were part of a positive story to put to the world. And in these times, it felt like a very resonant message.\u2019\n\nThe real terrorists belonged to the Pakistan-based militant Islamist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, but the film is clear that it is fanaticism, not the brainwashed men, that is to blame.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re only kids!\u2019 exclaims a police officer on seeing them on a security camera.\n\nIn the film, the terrorists are controlled by the mysterious Brother Bull, a commanding voice on their mobile phones issuing chilling orders to kill with promises of Paradise to come.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re kids led astray by this faceless voice who tells them to do terrible things,\u2019 says Armie Hammer, who plays David, an American staying in the hotel with his wife Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi).\n\n\u2018They\u2019re told, \u201cIf you do this, we\u2019re going to send money to your family.\u201d They are humans who are misled by ideology.\n\n'Towards the end they start to realise that. It\u2019s very tough to see a child who has been manipulated dealing with the consequences of his own actions.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s no getting around the fact that the terrorists were Muslims, but Slumdog Millionaire actor Dev Patel, who plays waiter Arjun, says, \u2018These guys were not doing what they did in the name of religion. This is an anti-religious-fundamentalism film.\n\n'That is the evil in this movie. The good is humanity and it comes in all different shapes and sizes and beliefs.\u2019\n\nIndian commandos and special forces pictured at the hotel which was under attack from Islamist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba in November 2008\n\nArjun is portrayed as a Sikh, whose beard and turban unnerve an English guest until, in a touching scene, he charms her by showing her a photo of his wife and daughter and explaining what the turban means to him.\n\nDev was raised a Hindu, but he says that the idea of making Arjun a Sikh was his.\n\n\u2018I thought we had this opportunity, where we were all locked into this room, to be diverse with the faces in the crowd.\n\n'I remembered reading about Sikh cab drivers being attacked after September 11, and it was just through cultural ignorance because nobody knew what their religion meant, what it stood for, what that turban and beard meant.\n\n'There is a version of religion that can be quiet and personal and pious, and that\u2019s what Arjun\u2019s religion is to him.\u2019\n\nArmie Hammer says the most poignant moment during filming was visiting the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.\n\n\u2018A few of us decided to go \u2013 me, Jason Isaacs and a couple of others. It was surreal.\n\n'Right as you walk in there\u2019s a wall with all the names written on it of the people who died in the attack. We looked at it and we all just started crying. It was intense.\u2019\n\nHotel Mumbai is in cinemas and available on Sky On Demand and Now TV.", "description": "The shocking film follows the heroic actions of staff at the Taj hotel in Mumbai as they tried to save guests after ten jihadi terrorists stormed the building and started to fire.", "authors": ["Gabrielle Donnelly For Weekend Magazine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19548878-0-image-a-18_1570724396595.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
