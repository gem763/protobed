It\u2019s generally difficult enough to adapt a single play of Shakespeare\u2018s, but taking three in one swing - even with the ammunition of a bowl-cutted Chalamet and an extremely louche Robert Pattinson as the French dauphin - borders on folly.\n\n\u201cThe King,\u201d too, has dispensed with Shakespeare\u2019s language and significantly tweaked one of the playwright\u2019s greatest creations, Falstaff (played by Edgerton), turning the unruly paragon of self-indulgence (whom Harold Bloom has called \u201clife itself\u201d) into merely a melancholy military man. People can get prickly when you make drastic changes to Shakespeare. But if you\u2019re going to come at \u201cThe King,\u201d you better come correct.\n\nThe plays (the Henry-verse, if you will) stand as among the greatest portraits of power ever penned. Moving from Hal\u2019s slow-building ambition to his transformation into King Henry V, they are about the cruel, cunning and perhaps necessary metamorphosis of a man into a king.\n\n\u201cThe King\u201d rapidly follows this political conversion, beginning with Hal\u2019s drinking days with Falstaff (depicted only a slow-motion montage) and, after the death of his father King Henry IV (Ben Mendelsohn), leading up to the pivotal Battle of Agincourt. But Mich\u00f4d and Edgerton have some twists on the tale and some different things to say about the formation of rulers and the conquest of war.\n\nThis Hal\u2019s youthful dalliances aren\u2019t just him delaying his inevitable ascendance. Here he is firmly pacifistic, uninterested in adopting the squabbles and rivalries of his bitter, ailing father or the macho-machinations of his contemporaries. He\u2019s disgusted by the relentless drumbeat of war. In an early scene, he tries to put a stop to a battle by earnestly appealing to their foe. In an attempt to stave off a bloody battle, he challenges their leader to a winner-take-all duel.\n\nAnd, oh, how young Chalamet looks in these scenes. He seems too precious for mud and appears to weigh less than his sword. With a full suit of armor on, he looks only scantly larger than a tin can. That might be incongruous to history or, at least, to the traditional view of Hal, but it makes \u201cThe King\u201d more interesting.\n\nIt\u2019s a movie best seen less as a historical epic and more as a metaphor for a rising young movie star coming up in a culture he aims to subvert. Chalamet did as much at the movie\u2019s red-carpet premiere (another red-colored battlefield), donning a glittering, sequined hoodie. This is a new kind of leading man, it\u2019s clear enough, and he again proves himself more than capable of assuming that mantle in \u201cThe King.\u201d\n\nMich\u00f4d also seems more in command of the material here than he has since his breakthrough, the brooding crime saga \u201cAnimal Kingdom.\u201d Like that film, \u201cThe King,\u201d too, turns on a dark axis of family. And like Mich\u00f4d\u2019s previous film, the Afghanistan War satire \u201cWar Machine,\u201d with Brad Pitt as a thinly veiled version of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, \u201cThe King\u201d is ultimately about the dubious drive for war and the duplicitous nature of those who monger for it.\n\nShakespeare, of course, did that, too, in a more complicated balance. \u201cHenry V\u201d has its own nationalistic jingoism (\u201cUpon St. Crispin\u2019s Day\u201d) but it was always countered, usually by Falstaff. Edgerton, here more rotund than he\u2019s been before, plays the knight principally as a reluctant warrior. Falstaff makes his (off-stage) exit in \u201cHenry V,\u201d but \u201cThe King\u201d keeps him along as Henry V\u2019s trusted military adviser. Mich\u00f4d\u2019s most clever revision is in how artfully and skillfully he renders the film\u2019s final battle at Agincourt, only to undercut it with a more disquieting concluding note.\n\nShakespeare, robbed of its poetry and its harmony, isn\u2019t so much. But it will do. At least we have Pattinson\u2019s campy French prince, who appears like a demonic Parisian rock star lounging backstage. He and Chalamet will make fine kings.\n\n\u201cThe King,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for some strong violence and language. Running time: 140 minutes. Two stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA definition of R: Restricted.
