Indeed, the trilateral deal remains likely to be downed by a tangle of political tripwires that include union skepticism, a lack of broader support in Congress and a desire to deny Trump a win during the impeachment inquiry, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThe most likely outcome is it dies,\u201d said Todd Tucker, a senior fellow at the New York-based Roosevelt Institute. \u201cWith the political landscape changing as rapidly as ours is every day, there\u2019s just no clear route to getting it done.\u201d\n\nWith the political landscape changing as rapidly as ours is every day, there\u2019s just no clear route to getting it done. Todd Tucker, senior fellow, Roosevelt Institute\n\nEven Trump has cast doubt on the deal he calls the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement or USMCA, telling reporters last week, \u201cI don\u2019t know that they\u2019re ever going to get to a vote.\u201d\n\nDemocrat working groups have continued to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer\u2019s team through a two-week Congressional recess as they seek to reshape provisions related to the environment, pharmaceutical drugs, Mexican labour standards and enforcement.\n\nAnd Pelosi sounded upbeat on Wednesday that Congress would still be able to work with the White House to approve the trade pact despite the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThey have nothing to do with each other,\u201d Pelosi told reporters in Washington. \u201cThe president has said he wants this U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to go forward. \u2026 Does it mean that he can\u2019t do that? That\u2019s really up to him.\u201d\n\nPelosi likely already has the 218 Congressional votes she needs to pass the deal, said Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade expert with the law firm Dickinson Wright. Indeed, virtually all of the 180 Republicans in Congress are expected to vote in favour of new NAFTA, leaving just a small number of Democrat votes necessary to push it through.\n\nBut Pelosi will want to see support that goes well beyond that in order to avoid deepening any divisions in the party prior to the 2020 election, he said.\n\n\u201cShe would need about 130 votes to be comfortable,\u201d said Ujczo.\n\nThat could be a tall order. Last month, more than 100 Democrats signed a letter to Trump demanding the USMCA include binding environmental standards and a commitment from the United States to remain in the Paris climate agreement. That suggests a significant portion of Congressional Democrats think the deal doesn\u2019t go far enough on environmental protection, potentially making a vote too much of a political risk for Pelosi, Tucker said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s already expending political capital engaging with Trump on this,\u201d he said. \u201cSo she\u2019ll want a majority of her party behind her on it and that\u2019s hard when 100 of them are making major demands on climate change.\u201d\n\nI think all the homework will be done so it\u2019s in a position of go or no go by Halloween. The question then is whether it gets done or gets lost in the jet wash of impeachment. Dan Ujczo, trade expert with the law firm Dickinson Wright\n\nFurther complicating the political calculus is the United Autoworkers strike against General Motors. The labour movement \u2014 highly influential among Democrats \u2014 continues to harbour concerns about the new NAFTA\u2019s provisions related to the enforcement of Mexican labour reforms. The original NAFTA is widely viewed to have fallen short of its promise in this regard and unions are determined to ensure the changes are implemented and enforced this time around.\n\nWith so much union skepticism still surrounding the deal \u201cthere is literally no scenario where this gets passed with the UAW on strike,\u201d Ujczo said. \u201cIt just looks terrible.\u201d\n\nSome still see a route to ratification in the U.S., even if it is narrowing. The need to have something to show for their time in Congress may be enough to push the Democrats forward particularly as the U.S. China trade war continues to squeeze farmers.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats took control of the House in the fall of last year and since then they haven\u2019t really done anything,\u201d said international trade lawyer Mark Warner. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they go into an election next year like that. There are clouds hanging over this but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over yet.\u201d\n\nBut with the U.S. legislative calendar soon to run into an election year, time is running out.\n\n\u201cI think all the homework will be done so it\u2019s in a position of go or no go by Halloween,\u201d said Ujczo. \u201cThe question then is whether it gets done or gets lost in the jet wash of impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe votes might be there but if Warren or Biden put the thumbs down, it\u2019s hard to see it being put up for a vote. Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics\n\nIndeed, despite their public commitment to keep the processes on separate tracks, many Democrats might find it tough to give Trump a win on trade while simultaneously seeking his impeachment.\n\nWhere they land on that question might come down to what current party leadership frontrunners Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden have to say about it, said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the missing part of this story,\u201d Hufbauer said. \u201cThey can say they are trying to get to yes but we still haven\u2019t heard from the two people who really matter. The votes might be there but if Warren or Biden put the thumbs down, it\u2019s hard to see it being put up for a vote.\u201d\n\nThat would leave the deal to languish until next year and possibly be dropped altogether by a Democrat-controlled White House, said Tucker.\n\n\u201cThe original NAFTA is there and the new deal isn\u2019t all that different,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may be happy to move on to other things.\u201d\n\nCanada says it\u2019s following the ratification process in the U.S. closely.\n\n\u201cMinister (Chrystia) Freeland has spoken to members of Congress from both parties and will continue to do so,\u201d said Adam Austen, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada. \u201cShe is also in very close touch with USTR Ambassador Bob Lighthizer. Our goal remains to move in tandem with the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With a file from Thomson Reuters\n\n\u2022 Email: npowell@nationalpost.com | Twitter: Naomi_Powell", "description": "Further complicating the political calculus is the United Autoworkers strike against General Motors", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/pelosi_edited-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
