Protesters seized some oil installations and the state oil company, Petroecuador, warned that production losses could reach 165,000 barrels a day, or nearly one-third of total production, if insecurity continues.\n\nThe government declared an overnight curfew around key state installations and government buildings as well as vital infrastructure such as airports and oil refineries.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, protesters broke through police barriers and some entered the empty congress building in Quito. Police fired tear gas and forced them to retreat.\n\nIndigenous protesters occupied two water treatment plants in the city of Ambato, south of the capital, raising concern about supply to residents, according to municipal authorities.\n\nOn Monday night, hundreds of people rampaged through the Duran area near the port city of Guayaquil, looting pharmacies, electronic appliance stores and other buildings.\n\nIn another part of Ecuador, police abandoned an armored vehicle to protesters who set it on fire. In multiple areas, rioters smashed car windows, broke into shops and confronted security forces.\n\nSome video footage has shown police beating protesters on the ground. Opponents have accused Moreno\u2019s government of human rights abuses in its attempts to quell disturbances.\n\nMoreno met with Cabinet ministers in Guayaquil on Tuesday after moving government operations there from Quito because of security problems. In comments broadcast by the Ecuavisa television network, he said he had the support of Ecuador\u2019s institutions and thanked them \u201cfor their defense of the democratic system.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators clash with riot police in Quito, Ecuador on Oct. 7, 2019.

The cuts were among measures announced as part of a $4.2 billion funding plan with the International Monetary Fund, which said the package will help the poor by strengthening Ecuador\u2019s economy and generating jobs.\n\nIndigenous groups have condemned what they call the government\u2019s \u201cclosed-door agreement\u201d with the IMF, saying in a statement that austerity measures would deepen economic inequality.\n\nThe groups said they were carrying out \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d and had detained some soldiers and police encroaching on indigenous territories. But they criticized vandalism and looting \u201cby external actors who are not affiliated with our movement or goals.\u201d\n\nSeveral military commanders stood behind Moreno during his address Monday night, underscoring the armed forces\u2019 support.\n\nIndigenous anti-government protesters arrive by foot in Quito, Ecuador on Oct. 8, 2019.

At the same time, he said his leftist predecessor and former ally, Rafael Correa, is trying to destabilize Ecuador with the help of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Ecuador is among dozens of nations calling for Maduro\u2019s ouster.\n\nMaduro dismissed the claim in a Tuesday evening television appearance. He jokingly called himself \u201cSuper Maduro\u201d and wiggled his dark mustache in a mocking suggestion that he can summon superpowers to topple governments.\n\n\u201cIf you, Mr. Len\u00edn Moreno, want to see the reality of what\u2019s happening, take that economic package back and engage in a dialogue with the people of Ecuador,\u201d Maduro added. \u201cOpen a dialogue with the peasants, workers and indigenous people.\u201d\n\nCorrea and Moreno have traded allegations of corruption in recent months, and Correa says he and his allies are victims of political persecution. Correa, who has been living in Belgium, faces an arrest warrant issued last year in Ecuador for alleged corruption.\n\nSeven Latin American countries \u2013 Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru and Paraguay \u2013 expressed support for Moreno and denounced Maduro for allegedly trying to \u201cdestabilize our democracies.\u201d Colombia has said previously that Venezuela is providing refuge to Colombian guerrillas, an allegation that the Venezuelan government denies.\n\nThe Organization of American States called for talks to end the unrest in Ecuador and said Moreno was constitutionally elected.\n\n\u201cThe kidnapping of police and military personnel is totally unacceptable, as is the destruction and looting of public goods, the burning of patrol cars and attacks on ambulances,\u201d the regional bloc\u2019s general secretariat said.\n\nSome 570 people have been arrested in Ecuador for crimes including attacks on people and property, according to Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Rold\u00e1n, the president\u2019s private secretary.\n\nAnti-government protesters clash with police near the National Assembly in Quito, Ecuador on Oct. 8, 2019. (Photo: Dolores Ochoa, AP)\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going through is not a peaceful mobilization, it\u2019s delinquency and vandalism,\u201d Rold\u00e1n said on Twitter.\n\nThe government last week declared a state of emergency, allowing it to curb some civil liberties as it tries to restore order.\n\nThe disturbances have spread from transport workers to students and then to indigenous demonstrators, an ominous turn for the government. Indigenous protesters played a major role in the 2005 resignation of Ecuador\u2019s president at the time, Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez, though the military\u2019s tacit approval was key to his removal.\n\nThe country\u2019s biggest indigenous group, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, said Moreno\u2019s government had failed to alleviate the welfare of Ecuador\u2019s \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d people. The group made similar complaints about Correa, his predecessor.\n\n\u201cWe have shown throughout Ecuador\u2019s history that indigenous peoples have the power to shut down the country when our rights are put at risk and power is abused,\u201d the indigenous groups said in their statement.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/08/ecuador-protestors-move-into-captial-president-leaves-quito/3914546002/", "description": "Violence has persisted since last week, when President Len\u00edn Moreno\u2019s decision to end subsidies led to a sharp increase in fuel prices.", "authors": ["Gonzalo Solano", "Associated Press", "Published P.M.
