He will name his first roster this week.\n\nAD\n\nThe next major competition for the top-ranked Americans is next summer\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo. Qualifying in the Concacaf region will take place in January and February.\n\nAndonovski won two National Women\u2019s Soccer League titles in five years with FC Kansas City before guiding Reign FC, which is based in Tacoma, Wash., to the semifinals each of the past two seasons. He was voted the league\u2019s coach of the year in 2013 and 2019.\n\nHis Reign players included attacker Megan Rapinoe and midfielder Allie Long from the U.S. squad. Defender Becky Sauerbrunn played for him with Kansas City. Several World Cup players from other countries have played for him in the NWSL.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe has this unique ability to really get the best out of every player. His tactical flexibility and knowledge is tremendous,\u201d Rapinoe said. \u201cEven being in the NWSL [which is considered perhaps the best women\u2019s league in the world], I don\u2019t think he is really able to put on his full arsenal of what he knows.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe search for Ellis\u2019s replacement was spearheaded by Kate Markgraf, a former U.S. defender who in August was named general manager of the women\u2019s program. Markgraf said she spoke with several candidates before narrowing the list for a second round of conversations.\n\nShe then chose two finalists. Laura Harvey of the Utah Royals is believed to be the other.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe one thing that is consistent when you watch any of Vlatko\u2019s teams \u2014 and especially when he was without some of his key players \u2014 they always liked to have the ball,\u201d Markgraf said. \u201cThey are always very sound defensively, and they attack creatively.\n\n\u201cVlatko was the best fit with his experience with elite players, how he sees the game, how he coaches the game and manages players, and his overall personality and ability to take on a job of this magnitude.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWith a small gap between the World Cup and Olympics, Andonovski said he would rely heavily on the core group that this summer won consecutive world titles for the first time in the program\u2019s golden history.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we are not going to expand the roster and the player pool.\u201d\n\nDuring a five-game victory tour, Ellis called up several players who were not on the World Cup roster, including Washington Spirit midfielder Andi Sullivan. The Olympic squad, however, would have only 18 players, five fewer than the World Cup team.\n\nAndonovski plans to conduct an identification camp in December with non-World Cup players.\n\nHe said he has spoken with forward Alex Morgan, who last week announced she is pregnant. Due to give birth in the spring, Morgan is angling to return for the Olympics.\n\nAD\n\nBeyond personnel decisions, Andonovski will have to adapt to a women\u2019s brand of the game that is expanding rapidly around the world. The United States remains a dominant figure in the sport, but many countries, including Spain and the Netherlands, are catching up.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe competition for us is only going to get more intense,\u201d USSF President Carlos Cordeiro said. \u201cThe years ahead won\u2019t be a time for resting on our laurels but for reaching even higher.\u201d\n\nAndonovski said he is prepared for the increasing challenges and the perennial high expectations he must meet.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say change,\u201d he said of his plans for the team. \u201cI would say evolve.\u201d\n\nAs a player, Andonovski was a pro for six years in North Macedonia, the Balkan nation formerly part of his native Yugoslavia. He then moved to the United States in 2000 to play indoor soccer in Wichita; Kansas City, Mo.; Philadelphia; and Stockton, Calif., before entering the indoor coaching ranks with Kansas City.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNow when I look back, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it,\u201d he said of landing the U.S. job. \u201cOnce I started coaching, in the back of my mind, there was always that thought if the opportunity presents itself, I would love to coach this team.\u201d\n\nAndonovski takes the helm as the U.S. players remain locked in a legal battle with the federation over equal pay. The sides are scheduled to go to court May 5.\n\nHe said he does not believe it will cause a distraction.\n\n\u201cI am very respectful of the drive the players have,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, that is something positive for me because it will translate to the field. I have no doubt once they step on the field they will be focused on what is important at that time. They\u2019ve proved that in the past, and I have no doubt they are going to do that in the future.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCordeiro said he did not want to comment on the specifics of the case, citing pending litigation. The sides remain in contact in hopes of reaching a resolution before they meet in court.\n\nAD\n\nEven though mediation in August failed, he said: \u201cWe are still very committed to resolving this in a fair way, but at the end of the day that requires compromise. \u2026 I sincerely hope we can put this behind us soon enough. Give us some more time, but hopefully we are heading in that direction.\u201d\n\nRead more on soccer:\n\nAD", "description": "Andonovski replaces Jill Ellis, who stepped down after leading the Americans to another World Cup title this year.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
