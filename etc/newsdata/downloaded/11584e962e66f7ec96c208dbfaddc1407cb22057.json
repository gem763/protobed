For the Devon-born photographer \u2013 who also covers news, sports, entertainment and royal engagements \u2013 working 12 to 14-hour days is part and parcel of the job.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nLondon Fashion Week is an inevitably unpredictable occasion, one which can result in a photographer accidentally being granted an all-access backstage pass for a show and with it, the opportunity to photograph the one and only Kate Moss. (Yes, Veysey was very lucky). A photographer must remain vigilant, their finger constantly hovering over the shutter-release button of their camera.\n\nSo, what does being a London Fashion Week photographer actually entail? How does it feel to know you just so happened to be in the right place at the right time to capture the perfect shot? And do Fashion Week photographers have to prepare to fight tooth and nail to claim the prime position at the end of the runway?\n\nHere is how a day in the life of a London Fashion Week photographer typically unfolds\u2026\n\nWhat time do you wake up during London Fashion Week and what do you eat for breakfast?\n\nI generally wake up around 7am during London Fashion Week. Most of the time I stick to something basic like cereal.\n\nDo you make any final preparations in the morning?\n\nThe first thing I do in the morning is check the day\u2019s schedule of shows. I then make sure all my gear for the day is packed and all my equipment is charged, including camera batteries, flash batteries, a laptop and WiFi devices. Running out of batteries at a show would be a nightmare.\n\nWhat time do you head over to the event and how do you get there?\n\nI normally aim to be at the venue at least an hour before the show. I always travel by tube, which can be interesting if I\u2019m lugging a step ladder around.\n\nWhat equipment do you use?\n\nI\u2019ve always shot with Nikon, and so I\u2019m currently using their D5 bodies and a full range of lenses from 14mm to 500mm. The main lens I use for the catwalk would be the 70-200mm, and I wouldn\u2019t need to use anything longer than a 300mm.\n\nHow far in advance of London Fashion Week do you know whether you\u2019re going to be photographing the event?\n\nAs Fashion Week is such a major event in the calendar, I can pretty much assume I\u2019ll always be photographing it, but I don\u2019t often get much notice on exactly which shows I\u2019ll be shooting.\n\nHow does your schedule work throughout the day?\n\nI am always designated to specific shows. My schedule is mapped out by my assignment editor who makes sure my colleague and I are able to cover as many of the most important shows as possible. In one day, I could cover anywhere from three to six shows, depending on the schedule. I then have to edit and wire my photographs as soon as the show is over, before covering the next. It\u2019s all quite frantic.\n\nAre you provided with refreshments at the event and do you have time to take a break for lunch?\n\nThere is a lot of caffeine on offer at London Fashion Week. I can normally grab something in between shows. Greggs do a great trade near the main BFC (British Fashion Council) venue on the Strand.\n\nWhat does your work at London Fashion Week predominantly consist of?\n\nI try to cover the fashion first, as most outlets require the straight up and down, front-foot-planted-on-the-catwalk shot, but if there\u2019s an opportunity to get something different then I try that as well. I think most photographers have the same aim, but some are more specialised and focus on details such as handbags and shoes.\n\nWhat do you do when you arrive at a show?\n\nWhen I get to a catwalk I normally chat to some of the other photographers or TV guys who may have seen the run-through to get information on the white balance and exposure settings. Then, the main thing to concentrate on is securing that position and looking after it, whilst also keeping an eye on arrivals on the front row.\n\nI also photograph the front row and am sometimes briefed before about who is invited or expected, as the organisers and PRs are keen to get as much coverage as possible for their shows. This has become a much bigger part of the job over the years.\n\nDo you ever have to compete with other photographers to get into prime position during a runway show?\n\nShows at the BFC showcase space are always marked up in advance, so there is no need to worry about your position. However, when a show is at a different location, photographers need to be at the venue an hour or so before to queue and mark our positions with gaffa tape and a marker pen, making sure it is as central as possible to cover the front row and accessible enough to get back into position to shoot the show.\n\nSome shows have limited space for photographers. In these cases, it can be challenging trying to find a gap in between people to get your shots. People often use large hard camera cases to sit or stand on, or foldable steps. For those who like shooting from the back with a longer lens, they will use a three-step ladder or more. Much of this prep work often takes place in a hurry and in the dark, and it\u2019s a marvel to watch unfold.\n\nSurprisingly, it\u2019s quite a diplomatic process and rarely leads to actual arguments.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

As the days can go on long and it is easy to over-shoot the shows, carrying extra camera body batteries is a must, as are chargers for everything else.\n\nHow long does a day at London Fashion Week typically last for a photographer?\n\nShows can start as early as 9am and as the day progresses, delays can start creeping into the schedule. A late show set to begin at 8pm or 9pm can be delayed for up to an hour or more, so it\u2019s not unusual to stagger out of the last show at 10pm or later and then wire it.\n\nThings tend to run more on time these days, possibly because of online live broadcasting and social media, but I still remember when we used to have to wait hours for shows to start. If there is a major after party that warrants covering the arrivals, I will also be there to photograph it.\n\nCan you describe the feeling of taking a photograph at London Fashion Week and knowing it\u2019s a fantastic, unique shot?\n\nYes, there are moments when you know you\u2019ve chosen to be in the right place with the right lens at the right moment, and it is a pretty good feeling. Often those times are when you\u2019ve taken a risk, gone to the side or a different angle, and caught a moment that sums up that particular show.\n\nOf course, it helps that often the staging, venue, lighting and models create an environment where it can sometimes be very easy to capture a beautiful image. However, this works both ways \u2013 it\u2019s hard to come up with a spectacular image if the show is poorly lit and the outfits are dull.\n\nCan you recall how it felt the first time one of your photographs was published?\n\nYes, in The Independent in 2002. It was a great feeling and is what keeps me shooting every day. It feels very good to see my photos online and in print \u2013 it\u2019s what makes us photographers tick.", "description": "Balancing unsteadily on a ladder for half an hour in an attempt to take a stellar shot of a model tearing up the runway is just one of the impressive lengths Shutterstock photographer James Veysey has gone to while working at London Fashion Week.", "authors": ["Sabrina Barr"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/18/mark-fast-show-runway-fall-winter-2019-london-fashion-week-uk-15-feb-2019-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
