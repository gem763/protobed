Dubbed Bird One, this custom e-scooter will also have a longer lifespan than past scooters \u2014 a key indicator if Bird ever hopes to become a profitable company. In a new twist, Bird will be selling it to anyone who\u2019s tired of ride-sharing and is ready to enter the new world of scooter ownership.\n\nBird One will be hitting the streets about seven months after the company unveiled its first custom-built scooter for dockless ride-sharing, Bird Zero. When Bird launched in Santa Monica, California, in 2017, its fleet was comprised mostly of consumer scooters made by Xiaomi and Segway-Ninebot, which were never intended for heavy fleet use and depreciated quickly. Bird lost money on each trip, but it managed to scale up after raising millions of dollars in venture capital funding.\n\nVanderZanden predicts its latest scooter will stay in circulation for at least 12 months\n\nBird Zero was intended to be a more rugged scooter that could take a beating and keep rolling for an average of 10 months, says Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden. With Bird One, VanderZanden predicts its latest scooter will stay in circulation for at least 12 months. The company plans to phase out all of its consumer-grade scooters over the summer; Bird says it will continue to use its Xiaomi M365 models for monthly personal rentals, and it will no longer purchase the Ninebot ES scooters.\n\nScooter companies have been struggling to turn a profit since bursting onto the scene almost two years ago. It all comes down to unit economics \u2014 how much revenue each individual scooter brings in for the company \u2014 and the most important number to consider is the lifespan of each scooter. The more trips and miles a single scooter can cover, the better it is for scooter companies that have to recoup the cost of each vehicle before they can start making money.\n\n\u201cThe economics for scooters with Bird Zero are already working,\u201d VanderZanden told The Verge. \u201cBut the exciting thing is, for every vehicle we roll out, we think the economics keep getting better and better. And importantly, because of economies of scale, the cost of the scooter goes down as well. So Bird One actually cost $50 less than Bird Zero, even though it\u2019s a superior vehicle.\u201d\n\nBird manufactured its Bird Zero scooters in cooperation with Okai, a Chinese scooter company. But VanderZanden wouldn\u2019t say who they partnering with on the production of Bird One, citing an NDA. \u201cI will say is we now use multiple manufacturers for vehicles,\u201d he noted.\n\nBird is feeling so bullish about its new scooter that it plans to start selling them for personal use. It\u2019s available in three colors: \u201cjet black,\u201d \u201cdove white,\u201d and \u201celectric rose.\u201d Preorders open today, at the not-inexpensive price of $1,299. Xiaomi\u2019s Mi scooter sells for $448 on Amazon, while Swagtron retails for around $299. (\u201cWe think it\u2019s a very attractive price,\u201d VanderZanden said.)\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a very attractive price.\u201d\n\nBird says its Bird One scooters will have a 473Wh battery, which VanderZanden says is twice the battery power as other e-scooters. That gives each scooter a range of up to 30 miles on a single charge. Other upgrades include GPS-enabled anti-theft device, 9-inch semi-solid pneumatic tires, and a digital lock that can be locked and unlocked from Bird\u2019s smartphone app.\n\nThe scooter tops out at 19 mph, and it can carry a max weight of 220 pounds. There is no lock-to mechanism, though, which some experts have said could help reduce vandalism and prevent scooters from blocking the sidewalks.\n\nIf your scooter breaks down, VanderZanden said you can bring it (or mail it) to one of Bird\u2019s service centers, located in North America and Europe. If the scooter is stolen, Bird\u2019s \u201cbird hunter\u201d network of freelancers may be able to track it down and find it. These are independent contractors who hunt down missing Bird scooters for the company, either to charge or bring in for repairs. The company \u201ccan\u2019t make any promises\u201d about their ability to find your stolen or lost scooter, VanderZanden added.\n\nAfter the winter lull, scooter companies are getting excited about the summer when they plan on rolling out new products and kicking their ride-sharing service into full gear. Bird is trying to get a leg up on the competition with a new scooter and new business models. It\u2019s how it plans on staying at the head of the pack.\n\n\u201cOur goal is really to not just do sharing, but to do sharing, rent, and own,\u201d said VanderZanden. \u201cReally go after micro mobility generally, [and] to try to help people get out of cars and onto short-range electric vehicles like Bird One.\u201d", "description": "Bird has unveiled its next-generation electric scooter that it says will be more durable, powerful, and longer-lasting than previous versions.
