White House officials then appeared to attempt a coverup of the call because of its potential abuse of power.\n\nOliver dubbed the scandal \u201cStupid Watergate II: The Stupidest Watergate.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most shocking part of this is that it might actually hurt\u201d Trump, Oliver said, unlike the president\u2019s previous misbehavior.\n\n\u201cPeople seem legitimately furious over this,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe House has opened an impeachment inquiry and even a few Republicans seem to be treading with caution for a change. It kind of does makes you wonder \u2018why now?\u2019 The president has done so many terrible things \u2015 why does this one count? It\u2019s hard to say \u2014 but it might just be because this one is simpler in some key ways.\u201d\n\nWatch above for Oliver\u2019s insightful and witty breakdown.", "description": "\"The president has done so many terrible things,\"  the \"Last Week Tonight\" host said as he dug into the Ukraine whistleblower scandal.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d91c8232100003100fe1d48.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
