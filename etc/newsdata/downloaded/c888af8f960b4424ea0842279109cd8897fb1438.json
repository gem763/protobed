It was last at $60.89 a barrel while Brent crude\n\nwas up 13% at $68.06 after earlier rising to $71.95.\n\nSignalling a weak start for Asian share markets, E-Minis\n\nfor the S&P 500 were off 0.4% while those for the Dow\n\neased 0.3%. Liquidity in Asia is expected to be thin on Monday with\n\nJapan shut for a public holiday, which could exacerbate market\n\nvolatility.\n\n\"Saturday's news of multiple drone attacks on Saudi Arabia\n\nAbqaiq petroleum processing facility is set to reverberate\n\nthrough global markets this week,\" said Ray Attrill, head of\n\nforex strategy at National Australia Bank.\n\nIn addition to massive supply disruptions, the attacks also\n\nheightened investor worries about the geopolitical situation in\n\nthe region and worsening relations between Iran and the United\n\nStates. Those concerns powered safe-haven assets with prices for\n\ngold climbing 1% in early Asian trade to $1,503.09.\n\nThe Yemeni Houthi group had claimed responsibility for the\n\nattack, which hit the world's biggest oil-processing facility\n\nbut a senior U.S. official told reporters on Sunday that\n\nevidence indicated Iran was behind it.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said late on Sunday the United\n\nStates was \"locked and loaded\" for a potential response to the\n\nattack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities. In currencies, the Saudi news pushed the yen up 0.2%\n\nto 107.8 per dollar while the Canadian dollar CAD=D3 rose 0.5%\n\nin anticipation of higher oil prices.\n\nThe euro EUR=D3 was little moved near a three-week top\n\nwhile the pound GBP=D3 hovered near Friday's two-month highs.\n\nThat left the greenback down 0.15% at 98.105 against a basket of\n\nsix major currencies .\n\n\"One immediate question this poses for bond markets is\n\nwhether a further rise in the inflation expectations component\n\nof bond yields - which have proved historically sensitive to oil\n\nprices - will give this month's sharp bond market sell-off fresh\n\nimpetus,\" Attrill added.\n\n\"Or will safe haven considerations dominate to drive yields\n\nlower? Watch this space.\"\n\nIn early Asian trading, futures for U.S. 10-year Treasury\n\nnotes TYv1 rose 0.2%, indicating yields may slip when cash\n\ntrading begins. Global bonds were sold off last week, sending yields higher,\n\nled by a broader risk rally on hopes the United States and China\n\nwould soon end their long trade war. Better-than-expected U.S.\n\nretail sales data also boosted sentiment.\n\nChinese data for industrial production, retail sales and\n\nfixed asset investment will be released later on Monday, which\n\ncould help set the tone for this week's trade.\n\nInvestors also await the outcome of the U.S. Federal\n\nReserve's policy meeting on Wednesday at which it is widely\n\nexpected to ease interest rates and signal its future policy\n\npath.
