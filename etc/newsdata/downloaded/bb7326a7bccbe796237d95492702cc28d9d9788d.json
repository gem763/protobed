ASIO said in its annual report that it would have its detailed business case assessed as part of the government's mid-year economic update due before the end of the year.\n\nUnder questioning on Monday from Senator Raff Ciccone, Burgess said the use of AI wasn't tied to the transformation program.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence, or data analytics -- because it means different things to different people using clever software and clever algorithms to help you do your job more effectively -- is something that is a core tenet of our transformation program,\" he said.\n\n\"But it is something that we would be doing regardless, because in a data-rich world, we all recognise that the computers can do things much faster than the human beings and as science advances, they are more capable.\"\n\nRecognising it is possible to overwhelm systems with data, Burgess said data analytics allows a balance to be struck.\n\n\"We will look to source and collect the information that we need at a minimum to do our job effectively,\" he said.\n\nBurgess also reassured Ciccone the spy agency was not running its analysis on public hardware.\n\n\"Once we are analysing data and how we analyse it, that's our secret sauce if you like, so that would not generally be done on the internet. We could be doing this in protected, secret, and top secret environments,\" he said.\n\nIn April, ASIO went looking for a systems integrator to provide it with an Azure-based solution covering protected, secret, and top secret-level information.\n\nAzure received approval in April 2018 from the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) to host protected-level classified government information.\n\nBurgess took on the mantle of Director-General in August, having previously been the Director-General of the Australian Signals Directorate since December 2017. Burgess was previously chief information security officer at Telstra.\n\nIn its annual report, ASIO warned about social media platforms being used to recruit people into hostile intelligence services. Specifically, the intelligence agency provided advice describing how LinkedIn and other social media platforms were being used to target people in positions for foreign intelligence purposes.\n\n\"In a small number of organisations, security teams were considering making policy changes in response to receiving our advice; for example, to limit or restrict social media access on their corporate networks,\" ASIO said.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTerrorism, espionage, and cyber: ASIO's omne trium perfectum\n\nASIO's outgoing Director-General of Security reflects on the 'security triptych' that is of upmost concern to Australia's national security.\n\nASIO discloses LinkedIn foreign intelligence threat\n\nIt also warned that the telecommunications sector is an 'attractive target' for foreign interference.\n\nMike Burgess named as new ASIO Director-General of Security\n\nFrom Telstra chief information security officer to Director-General of Security at Australia's intelligence organisation in less than three years.\n\nASIO eyes Microsoft Azure for phase one of tech transformation\n\nSix packages are up for grabs under the spy agency's systems integration tender, with protected, secret, and top secret information to be hosted solely on Azure.\n\nHuawei believes banning it from 5G will make countries insecure\n\nChinese giant warns of potential for backdoors in 6G thanks to AI.\n\nAustralian Signals Directorate launches open source data visualisation tool\n\nASD touts Constellation as a data analysis application enabling data access, federation, and manipulation activities across large and complex datasets.", "description": "Australian spy agency has too much data and wants to avoid missing something it should have known.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/26/cb39cdb6-221d-49fb-a0d5-6847b23b7b60/thumbnail/770x578/d6e094455a0c3489d22fbda8fe10bd0e/canberra-parliament-house.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
