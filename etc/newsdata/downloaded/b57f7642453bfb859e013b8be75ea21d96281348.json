He called for the opposition to \"defend\" reforms started under Bachelet.\n\nHe said Pinera walked away with \"a solid and impeccable triumph\".\n\nPinera will lead the country - the world's top copper producer - for four years starting in March 2018.\n\nHe will once again take over from Bachelet, who was barred by the constitution from running for re-election.\n\nBachelet and Pinera have tag-teamed the presidency since Bachelet first took office in 2006. Since then, they have alternated in power, switching Chile's politics between centre-left and centre-right each time.\n\nPinera supporters were gathered outside his election headquarters in anticipation of his victory speech.\n\nUncertain race\n\nThe outcome of the runoff had been far from certain after Pinera scored a much lower than expected 37% in the first round of the election held November 19.\n\nAnalysts had speculated that Guillier could bolster his 22% from that round by getting votes from other leftist candidates who were defeated.\n\nBut in the end, most voters appeared to come down in favour of the experience of Pinera, who is worth some $2.7bn and painted himself as a safe pair of hands for Latin America's fifth-biggest economy.\n\nVoting had taken place under a sombre cloud on Sunday, following the deaths of five people and the disappearance of 18 more in a mudslide in the country's south.\n\nRead: 5 dead, 15 missing in southern Chile landslide\n\n\n\nBoth candidates had projected confidence, with Pinera stating as he cast his ballot: \"I have the firm conviction that we are going to win these elections and that better times are going to come for all Chilean households.\"\n\nWith no recent reliable voter surveys in the weeks before Sunday's runoff, however, the outcome had been seen as wide open.\n\nMarco Moreno, of Central University, had called it \"the most uncertain election since the return of democracy\" after the end of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship in 1990.\n\nLower growth\n\nAlthough copper exports, which contribute greatly to Chile's wealth, are increasing thanks to demand from China and from the burgeoning manufacture of electric cars, the country is struggling relative to previous years.\n\nIts GDP is forecast to expand a modest 1.4% this year, the slowest pace in eight years. Forecasts suggest it will grow 2.8% next year.\n\nPinera and Guillier also promised to expand free university tuition brought in under Bachelet - a measure with historical resonance in Chile because paid tuition was introduced under Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule.\n\nFor Pinera, the vow was a U-turn, contradicting an earlier statement he had made that \"free things mean less commitment\".\n\nThe president-elect was often accompanied by his wife Cecilia Morel while campaigning, and also by their four children and several of their nine grandchildren.\n\nTheir presence softened his public character, according to a member of his entourage who requested anonymity.\n\nAs much as he is known as a demanding businessman - who had to divest investments including an airline and a football team for his first mandate - he also has a reputation for being cultivated, humorous and full of ideas.\n\nHe hasn't hidden his wealth, even wearing an ostentatious watch in the red of his campaign colour. But he has also sought to project an image of someone concerned about injustice and ordinary people.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Billionaire Sebastian Pinera will return to power as Chile's president next year, according to virtually complete results from a runoff election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/123/4329b23755264af295869ecba21bdece.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-18"}
