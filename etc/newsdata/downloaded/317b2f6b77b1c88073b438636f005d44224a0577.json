(Hillary Johnston/CBC)\n\n\"These signs are intended to pop,\" explained McKenna, noting she has many red Liberal signs across the riding. Those traditional signs compete with those of NDP challenger Emilie Taman, Conservative Carol Clemenhagen, Angela Keller-Herzog of the Greens, and Merylee Sevilla of the People's Party of Canada.\n\nLike Poilievre's, the signs in Ottawa Centre are McKenna's own initiative and approved by her own agent rather than her political party.\n\nMcKenna also suggests the Conservatives might form the government instead of her Liberals.\n\n\"The point is to differentiate from all the signs that are out there, to cut out the noise, to get to what is really at stake. This is a really important election. These are really important issues,\" she said.\n\nLoyal to party lines, both say\n\n\"I don't recall seeing signs like these before,\" said Steve White, a political science professor at Carleton University.\n\nLocal campaign signs will sometimes emphasize the party leader, however, or play up the candidate him or herself, he said.\n\nSigns like this one have cropped up on busy roads in Ottawa Centre during the final week of the 2018 campaign. (CBC)\n\nWhite wouldn't speculate about the strategy behind Poilievre's and McKenna's new signs, and says it's hard to know what impact they will have.\n\n\"There's very little research on the impact of campaign signs on the vote in Canada,\" White said.\n\nAsked if his black signs are an effort to depart from the central campaign, Poilievre says the messages are in line with the Conservative platform.\n\n\"I'd say it's complementary,\" Poilievre said.\n\nSimilarly, McKenna said she's not trying to distance herself and no one questions she's a Liberal.\n\n\"I wear red all the time,\" she said.", "description": "With less than a week to go before the federal election,\u00a0two incumbent\u00a0candidates in Ottawa\u00a0have erected unusual issue-based campaign signs that are neither\u00a0Liberal red nor Conservative blue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323417.1571257741!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mckenna-poilievre-sign-collage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
