More than 2,400 U.S. troops have been killed since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan to go after the Taliban, which were harboring al Qaeda leaders responsible for 9/11.\n\nCanceling the talks also goes against Trump\u2019s pledge to withdraw the remaining 13,000 to 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan and close U.S. involvement in the conflict that is closing in on 18 years.\n\nZalmay Khalilzad, the Trump administration\u2019s diplomat talking to the Taliban leaders for months, has said recently that he was on the \u201cthreshold\u201d of an agreement with the Taliban aimed at ending America\u2019s longest war. Trump, however, has been under pressure from the Afghan government and some lawmakers, including Trump supporter Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Caroline Republican, who have expressed mistrust of the Taliban and have said they think it\u2019s too early to withdraw American forces.\n\nAssociated Press A man enters the press area of the White House at dusk on Saturday.\n\n\u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday evening.\n\n\u201cThey were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, a Taliban car bomb exploded and killed an American soldier, a Romanian service member and 10 civilians in a busy diplomatic area near the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. The bombing was one of many attacks by the Taliban in recent days during U.S.-Taliban talks.\n\nThe Defense Department says Sgt. 1st Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, 34, from Morovis, Puerto Rico, was killed in action when the explosive device detonated near his vehicle. He was the fourth U.S. service member killed in the past two weeks in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn\u2019t, they only made it worse!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIf they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear if the U.S.-Taliban talks are over or only paused. Trump said he called off the peace negotiations after the bombing, but Khalilzad, the U.S. envoy negotiating with the Taliban, was meeting with leaders of the insurgent group in Doha, Qatar, on both Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe State Department and the White House declined to respond to requests for clarification.", "description": "Trump\u2019s tweet was surprising because it would mean that the president was set to host members of the Taliban at the presidential retreat in Maryland just...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ880_white__ZG_20190907233409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
