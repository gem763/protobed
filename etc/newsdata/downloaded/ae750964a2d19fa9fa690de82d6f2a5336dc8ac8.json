The president-elect has already been confirmed but she is also likely to face tough questions from senior members of the Parliament next week, particularly given the outrage over her decision to name a vice president for \"Protecting the European Way of Life\" whose job includes migration policy.\n\nThe committee hearings for commissioner-designates will take place from September 30 to October 8, with two live-streamed sessions on the first day, six hearings a day on October 1, 2 and 3, three hearings on October 7 and the hearings of the three executive vice presidents on October 8. MEPs will then vote on the entire College of Commissioners in the week of October 23.\n\nHowever, a fight has broken out over the format of the hearings of von der Leyen's top vice presidents \u2014 Frans Timmermans, Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\nThe final decision on the format of hearings will be made at a Conference of Presidents meeting next week.\n\nOn Friday, the center-left Socialists & Democrats group said they would push for the trio to be quizzed by the Parliament's Conference of Presidents (COP), made up of the legislature's president and the leaders of its political groups.\n\n\u201cWe envisage a special format with a COP that would be open to the press,\u201d said Utta Tuttlies, the S&D group spokesperson.\n\nBut that idea went down badly with the center-right European People's Party, the biggest group in the Parliament, and the liberal-centrist Renew Europe. They argued that the Conference of Presidents would not have the specialist knowledge to question the nominees on their portfolios.\n\n\"We have asked the COP yesterday that three VPs be interrogated by competent commissions,\" said Pedro Lopez de Pablo, the EPP's spokesperson.\n\nPascal Canfin, the chair of the Parliament's environment committee and a member of Renew Europe, told a group of French reporters on Friday: \u201cIt is out of the question for us that the hearing of the vice presidents would be carried out by the Conference of Presidents of the political groups.\"\n\nCanfin said that Timmermans, the Dutch social democrat who is first vice president of the current Commission, was subject to a hearing from the Conference of Presidents in 2014 and \u201cit was judged as extremely weak because they didn\u2019t have the competence, they didn\u2019t have expertise and it was blah-blah.\"\n\n\"For us it is an absolute red line to avoid having that again,\u201d Canfin said.\n\nTimmermans is slated to have a big over-arching job, responsible for an environmentally-friendly European Green Deal that von der Leyen has pledged to deliver.\n\nIn addition, Canfin said that even if green issues are not part of Timmermans' \"personal history,\u201d \"he is a smart politician and will seize the opportunity presented to him. The new organisation of the European Commission provides him with all the levers to act.\u201d\n\nCanfin proposed his own environment committee quiz Timmermans, alongside the agriculture, transport, industry, research and energy, and economic affairs committees.\n\n\"It should happen publicly and all MEPs, citizens and the media should get an opportunity to hold the Commission president to account\" \u2014 David Lundy, GUE spokesperson\n\nThe final decision on the format of hearings will be made at a Conference of Presidents meeting next week.\n\nSome MEPs are also angry that a meeting in Strasbourg next week between the Conference of Presidents and von der Leyen, at which she will explain her portfolio choices including the \"European Way of Life\" post, will be held behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cIt is a problem that it is not going to happen publicly,\" David Lundy, the spokesperson of the left-wing GUE group told reporters Friday. \"It should happen publicly and all MEPs, citizens and the media should get an opportunity to hold the Commission president to account.\"\n\nMEPs \u2014 including left-wingers, greens, liberals and social democrats \u2014 have argued that the new title is deeply offensive as it implies that migrants and refugees pose a threat to Europe\u2019s way of life.", "description": "Members of the European Parliament at odds over how to grill Commission nominees.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Laura Kayali", "Hans Von Der Burchard", "Madi Winfield", "Florian Eder"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167508698-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
