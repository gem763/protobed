Actor Aaron Paul (El Camino, BoJack Horseman) called it a bad decision.\n\n\u201cWhy support and finance filmmakers visions on one hand and then work to destroy the presentation of those films on the other?\u201d Bird tweeted.\n\nA Netflix spokesperson told The Verge that the company is always experimenting with ways to improve subscribers\u2019 viewing experiences. Netflix doesn\u2019t have any plans at this time to roll it out to larger screens in the future. The spokesperson added that while Netflix understands the concerns of creators when it comes to playback controls, this isn\u2019t any different than what DVD players have been capable of doing for years. It\u2019s a heavily requested feature from subscribers, the spokesperson said. Netflix users will have to opt in to the option to play shows and movies at various speeds every single time, meaning it isn\u2019t an automatic fixture.\n\n\u201cWhy support and finance filmmakers visions on one hand and then work to destroy the presentation of those films on the other?\u201d\n\nThis is just one of a few features Netflix is currently testing for some mobile Android users. The company is also testing the ability for some Android mobile users to change the brightness levels of an episode directly in the episode window, as well as giving customers the ability to more directly control different language audio.\n\nThe original announcement over playback speed testing was met with a divisive response. While some people agreed with the aforementioned filmmakers\u2019 stances, others argued that it\u2019s a common feature for listening to podcasts or watching YouTube videos that would be greatly welcome on Netflix. This is especially true, the latter group argued, when binge-watching a show they\u2019ve already seen. Having the ability to slow down a feature or show is often a request from people who are watching foreign language titles, according to Netflix\u2019s spokesperson.\n\nThe debate boils down to streaming technology\u2019s impact on artistic control. Netflix is trying to serve the subscriber \u2014 the person spending $13 every month to watch what they want, when they want, however they want. Giving them more control over their viewing experience is crucial to Netflix\u2019s core philosophy; it serves its subscribers first and foremost.\n\nNetflix doesn\u2019t have any plans at this time to roll out the feature to larger screens\n\nThe Hollywood guard sees this as an affront to artistic vision. Whereas most movies hit theaters before they were made available on DVD, giving filmmakers some control over how their films were watched by audiences before seeing a home release, many titles on Netflix aren\u2019t. Netflix has gone from a platform that simply plays things on command to a bonafide distributor. There are more Netflix Originals than ever before, and many of those films don\u2019t receive the same theatrical release treatment that a Marvel movie does.\n\nThe playback function seems especially fraught with filmmakers, and that\u2019s understandable. TV showrunners have learned to deal with people\u2019s use of personal technology since before TiVo. Television subscribers have played around with the way they\u2019ve watched TV since taping shows in the \u201890s, fast-forwarding and rewinding episodes to make for a better viewing experience for themselves \u2014 even if that\u2019s not the way the showrunners and writers intended it to be watched. Personal technology disrupted TV watching so long ago that it feels normal now.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case for movies. But the more that streaming services step into studio and distributor roles, the more change occurs. Director Martin Scorsese recently called this new streaming-first era \u201can even bigger revolution than sound brought to cinema,\u201d adding that it \u201copens up the original conception of what a film is,\u201d according to The Associated Press. Part of that revolution is understanding that while filmmakers still have control over the technology they use to make their movies, viewers more frequently have control over the technology they use to watch these movies. Adjustable playback speeds might be hard to stomach, but it also seems like an inevitable feature.", "description": "Netflix is testing a feature that allows a small group of Android phone users to change the playback speed of what they\u2019re watching, but some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest actors and filmmakers are pushing back.
