On defense, the Utes have seven interceptions and have been stubborn against the run.\n\nThe Utes are fourth in the nation in rushing yards allowed per game (53.8) and have allowed 72 total points in five games (14.4 points per game allowed). But they will be facing a confident Oregon State team that has turned things around after two nonconference losses to open the season.\n\nThe Beavers (2-3, 1-1) are coming off a 48-31 road win at UCLA on Saturday, and find themselves in the thick of the race for the Pac-12 North title.\n\nA win this Saturday against No. 15 Utah would be the Beavers' first against an FBS opponent at Reser Stadium since the 2016 finale against Oregon.\n\nSenior quarterback Jake Luton tied a school record with six total touchdowns against the Bruins, a game in which the Beavers took a 21-0 lead and stayed in front the rest of the way.\n\nLuton has yet to be intercepted in 161 pass attempts this season.\n\n\"He's making some great decisions with it,\" head coach Jonathan Smith told The Oregonian. \"He's getting some help, too, with our protections.\n\n\"He's really improved his game from last year. I think he's playing with a ton of confidence, and he's got a ton of confidence in the guys around him.\"\n\nAnother weapon for the Beavers is wide receiver Isaiah Hodgins, whose nine touchdown catches are tied for second most in the nation. Hodgins also ranks fifth in receiving yards with 632, and second in receptions per game with 8.6 on 43 catches.\n\nHodgins made three touchdowns catches in the win over UCLA.\n\nUtah is the conference's leader in rushing yards per game at 223.4, but Oregon State averages almost six points more per game on offense (37 to 31.4).\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "The Utah Utes look to keep pace in the race for the Pac-12 South championship  this Saturday with what could be a tough test on the road at Oregon State.The...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
