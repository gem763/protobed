The UN's refugee body recorded nearly 115 000 arrivals in 2018, down from 170 000 in 2017 and over one million in 2015.\n\nEuropean migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos will also attend the Malta talks, as will Finland's interior minister - as they hold the EU presidency.", "description": "Interior ministers from four EU countries will meet in Malta to try to work out an automatic system to determine which countries will welcome migrants rescued in the central Mediterranean.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5463/039dec7438c7497e93c361cfe3c68bd5.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
