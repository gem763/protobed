Concerns were raised after the disease was detected last month in East Timor, one of Australia's closest neighbours.\n\nMs McKenzie said that 27 tonnes of pork products have been seized at Australia's borders since February.\n\nThe minister noted a \"concerning\" increase in the number of these products contaminated with ASF, saying contamination rates jumped from 15% in February to 48% in September.\n\n\"That is why, if you are travelling from an African swine flu affected country, we are watching you,\" said Ms McKenzie.\n\nCountries across Asia have been struggling to contain the spread of ASF, an incurable condition that is not dangerous to humans but is fatal to pigs. The disease has a mortality rate of up to 100%, according to the UN.\n\nIt emerged in East Africa in the early 1990s, moved through sub-Saharan Africa, and has also been recorded in Europe.\n\nChina - which has half the world's pigs, and where pork is often a staple food - confirmed an outbreak last August.\n\nSince then, more than one million pigs have been culled in China, and over five million in Vietnam.\n\nIn South Korea hundreds of soldiers and civilian hunters have been deployed along the country's border with North Korea to kill wild boars and feral pigs to stop the spread of the disease.", "description": "The Vietnamese woman is the first person to be sent home under strict new laws to keep out swine fever.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3722/production/_109241141_pork.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
