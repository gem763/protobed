No10 said it would consider backing \u201csomething like\u201d this option if it loses tonight\u2019s vote.\n\nFurious Labour blasted the Lib Dem and SNP bid as a \"ridiculous stunt\" as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell raged: \"Looks like the Lib Dem and Tory pact of 2010 is being re-established.\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\n\"They are back together, selling out the People\u2019s Vote campaign and the cross party campaign to prevent a no deal.\n\n\"The Lib Dems will stop at nothing to get their ministerial cars back.\"\n\nBut despite Labour's fury and initial Tory brush-offs the fresh election bid appeared to be gathering momentum.\n\nYesterday, Tory chairman James Cleverly branded the Lib Dem plan a \u201cgimmick\u201d while Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan also called it a \u201cstunt\u201d.\n\nYet last night government aide Bim Afolami said: \"I'm not necessarily averse to it.\"\n\nAnd today schools minister Nick Gibb did not rule out backing a move similar to the Lib Dems', despite accusing the party of \"disobeying\" the 2016 vote to leave the EU.\n\nIt came as EU leaders agreed to delay the Brexit deadline for the third time, setting a new \"flexible\" date of January 31 - which will come earlier if there's a deal agreed.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nA source told Reuters the SNP/Lib Dem election bid was a factor that persuaded EU leaders to get a three-month extension over the line.\n\nLabour has insisted it won't back an election until Mr Johnson makes \"absolutely clear\" a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.\n\nThat had been widely thought to mean a no-deal on October 31.\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn has since suggested it also includes a threat of a no-deal in 2021 - one which is wrapped up in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.\n\nBoris Johnson sailed so close to the deadline this time that a no-deal plan known as Operation Brock, slowing lorries to 30mph on Kent's M20, had already come into force at 6am today.\n\nThere was a slim chance Labour - which has told MPs to abstain or vote against an election tonight - could still change its tune before tonight's vote.\n\nJeremy Corbyn was due to summon a meeting of his shadow cabinet later today.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBoris Johnson wanted MPs to back a general election through the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act - which crucially would not fix the date of the poll in law, or have any conditions.\n\nThe Lib Dem bid on the other hand would set the date of December 9 in law.\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson said this would remove his \"wriggle room\" to sneakily schedule a poll after the January 31 deadline. \"Because people can't trust what this man says, I think setting that date in law is a very good idea,\" she said.\n\nBut her bid for a one-line Bill could also fail if it becomes snarled up in amendments, such as for EU citizens to vote (they are not allowed in general elections) or to extend the franchise to 16-year-olds.\n\nDespite backing votes at 16, Ms Swinson suggested she wouldn't want amendments saying the Bill should be \"as simple as possible\".\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe told the Today programme: \"It certainly, it seems to me a sensible way forward. We also understand from our contacts in the EU that putting forward this bill and sending the letter that we did has helped out EU friends have confidence that if they offer the extension that they're discussing today that that will be time well spent.\n\n\"One of their big concerns was that they offered an extension earlier this year, said 'don't waste the time', and then we had a Conservative leadership election and Boris Johnson mucked about not trying to get a deal, shutting down parliament, and you know, the very master class in time wasting so, understandably, they had a degree of reluctance, I think evidenced by the fact they didn't grant the extension on Friday when many thought they would.\n\n\"So I'm hopeful that as a result of what we've done we will see that extension granted today because otherwise we're still in the very real risk of crashing out without a deal on Thursday.\"\n\nShe said there are various reasons why December 9 makes more sense than December 12 for an election.\n\n\"Clearly, it's three further days away from Christmas and I understand that the public appetite for an election around Christmas is not necessarily high so I think from the point of view of the economy and retailers, keeping it as far away as possible is helpful.\n\n\"We also have the consideration that there will be many people that will be moving around the country around that time.\n\n\"Many students who live in two places but might only be registered to vote in one place.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to see people disenfranchised and so having it earlier rather than closer to the end of term time for them I think makes sense as well.\n\n\"And also, it is the earliest possible date where we can pass this Bill, and then have an election, so it gets it done as soon as possible,\" Ms Swinson added.\n\nHow does a one-line election Bill work?\n\nBy MIKEY SMITH\n\nIf the PM can\u2019t get the two-thirds majority he needs to trigger an election under the cumbersome Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, there is one other option.\n\nHe \u2013 or anyone else \u2013 can table a one-line bill that would legally change the FTPA just like any other law.\n\nIt\u2019s a neat way around the FTPA, but it\u2019s risky.\n\nBecause it\u2019s a fully-fledged bill, not just a motion, MPs can change it once it is under way. They could tack on anything they like \u2013 including a second referendum.\n\nBut like a game of legal Buckaroo, every extra thing they hang on it makes it more likely to be pulled.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\nTonight from 5pm MPs will vote on whether to hold a general election . In this vote, Boris Johnson will need to get the support of two thirds of MPs.\n\nJeremy Corbyn says he will not decide on whether to back an election until the extension is granted.\n\nIf the PM loses the vote tonight \u2013 which is likely \u2013 then he, the Lib Dems, or both will bring forward one-line bills to trigger an election on either December 9 or December 12.\n\nIn a less likely scenario, No10 could find enough wavering MPs to publicly back a revised schedule for scrutinising Mr Johnson\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement Bill.\n\nHe could then press ahead with trying to get it through the Commons, taking an election off the table.", "description": "Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson wrote to the Tory Prime Minister today as MPs prepare to look at a new election bid - just as another one for December 12 faces defeat", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Leon Neal", "Reuters", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Wpa Pool"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741262.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Prime-Minister-Johnson-Greets-Representatives-Of-The-Poppy-Appeal-Outside-Downing-Street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
