I just think he\u2019s dumb, I really do. I don\u2019t even think he knows what he\u2019s talking about. That\u2019s my take on it,\u201d the conservative commentator said Thursday.\n\nMr. Hannity lodged the criticism on his syndicated radio program on the heels of Mr. Mulvaney discussing the administration\u2019s dealing with Ukraine during a White House briefing.\n\nSpeaker to reporters earlier Thursday, Mr. Mulvaney suggested the White House withheld aid from Ukraine in connection with Mr. Trump requesting that Kyiv investigate the Democratic National Committee and the 2016 U.S. presidential race, giving credence to claims of a quid pro quo at the heart of impeachment proceedings underway on Capitol Hill.\n\nDemocrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump last month after his administration tried to keep Congress from viewing a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the U.S. intelligence community. The White House later released a rough transcript of a July phone call that sparked the complaint, and it showed that Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden and Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC after Democrats were hacked by Russians in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney told reporters.\n\nDemocrats leading the impeachment push were quick to pounce on the comments as evidence of a quid pro quo, resulting in Mr. Mulvany trying to walk back his remarks later Thursday.\n\n\u201cI think, some of these people are so stupid,\u201d Mr. Hannity said in the interim. \u201cRead the transcript. We don\u2019t need a non-whistleblower whistleblower. You don\u2019t need a chief of staff\u2019s idiotic interpretation of things, when the president and the president of Ukraine and everybody else can read it all themselves. That\u2019s what\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nMr. Hannity, 57, has previously claimed to be the president\u2019s strongest supporter at Fox News. Mr. Trump, on his part, has previously linked Mr. Hannity\u2019s glowing coverage of his administration to high ratings, meanwhile.\n\nMr. Hannity\u2019s remarks about Mr. Mulvaney was first reported by Media Matters for America.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
