Aechere Crump, the gunner, braced themselves for impact.\n\nThe crash sent Victor\u2019s head smashing through the driver\u2019s hatch and broke his back, while Crump ruptured her femoral artery and was bleeding heavily.\n\nDetermined to save their lives, Maes began twisting and turning to free his leg which was caught in the turret gear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs he pulled at his leg, he felt a tearing sensation and only then realised that it was completely gone.\n\nMaes told Fox News: \u2018I pushed and pulled at my leg as hard as I could to get loose and felt a sharp tear.\n\nSgt. Aechere Crump, left and Victor Alamo, right, visit Ezra Maes (Picture: DVIDS)\n\n\u2018I thought I had dislodged my leg, but when I moved away, my leg was completely gone.\u2019\n\nAs blood poured from his wound, Maes forced himself to the back of the tank to grab a medical kit.\n\nHe says that he knew if they were to make it out alive, he had to \u2018step up\u2019 or that they would all die.\n\nMaes ordered his crew to tie belts around the wounds to stop the bleeding.\n\nEzra Maes undergoes physical rehabilitation at the Center for the Intrepid, Brooke Army Medical Center\u2019s cutting-edge rehabilitation center at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas (Picture: Corey Toye/US Army)\n\nThe crew also realised that the tank\u2019s communication systems had been destroyed in the crash, and only one cell phone was left in working condition.\n\nMiraculously Maes\u2019 phone began to ring, but he couldn\u2019t reach it.\n\nIt was down to the perseverance and determination of Crump, who with a broken leg, tossed Maes the phone, meaning he could text a friend their location.\n\nEzra Maes says he hopes to help others regain their mobility (Picture: Corey Toye/US Army)\n\nMaes and his crew were eventually rushed to hospital, though he has little recollection of what happened, apart from a memory of his sergeant carrying his leg on a shoulder while running up a hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is currently waiting to be fitted with a prosthetic leg, and is undergoing physical and occupational therapy and tries to stay active by doing yoga three times a week.\n\nMaes also hopes to become a prosthetist and help others regain their mobility, adding that him and his crew \u2018are lucky to be alive\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
