Optimistic about Andy Dalton. Curious about John Ross. Validated over Tyler Boyd. Intrigued by the running game, and a believer in head coach Zac Taylor.\n\nMaybe Taylor and crew will get there eventually. But Sunday against San Francisco, it was time to meet the new boss \u2014 same as the old boss.\n\nOffensive designer Kyle Shanahan could do no wrong on the other sideline.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nShanahan carries one of those gigantic play sheets, the laminated page that looks like a Denny\u2019s menu. Sunday at Cincinnati, Shanahan hit a grand slam, dialing up winner after winner. It added up to a 41-17 beatdown and a reminder that any Shanahan offense is usually a fruitful one for fantasy.\n\nOf course, the usage tree could be stretched out in San Francisco, making our fantasy choices difficult. Raheem Mostert racked up 151 yards and a score on 16 touches, while Matt Breida collected 132 yards on his 13 opportunities. Both of those lines will play, but it was pesky to see Jeff Wilson (10-34 rushing) steal a couple of touchdowns. Tevin Coleman is out multiple weeks, putting Breida and Mostert well inside the cut line Week 3 against Pittsburgh.\n\nRaheem Mostert was just one San Francisco player who went off at Cincinnati. (Andy Lyons/Getty Images)\n\nThe downfield passing had a platoon feel to it, too. Deebo Samuel jumped off the screen, bobbing and weaving for a 5-87-1 afternoon on seven targets. Perhaps the fresh season is going to be partially defined by breakout rookie receivers, and Samuel looked the part here. Veteran Marquise Goodwin was only targeted three times, but he caught all three of them, racking up 77 yards and a score.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe\u2019re not going to worry about George Kittle, even off a 3-54-0 day (three targets). The Niners won\u2019t be able to run the ball 42 times a week. But perhaps it\u2019s not going to happen for Dante Pettis; despite playing in about half the snaps, he didn\u2019t see a target. His one moment of consequence came on a 16-yard option pass.\n\nI\u2019ve been openly questioning just how good Jimmy Garoppolo is \u2014 perhaps a fool\u2019s errand. Garoppolo avoided negative plays (zero sacks, just one pick) and made the most of 25 attempts: 17 completions, 297 yards, three touchdowns. That hashes out to a 131.2 rating and a 11.9 YPA. Those are Pro Bowl numbers.\n\nThe Bengals rushing game was DOA, but at least Dalton was able to fill the stat page (26-for-42, 311 yards, 2 TDs, 1 pick). If the Bengals defense is going to play this poorly, Dalton is the likely beneficiary. The reliable Boyd caught all of his looks (10-122-0), while Ross came through for the second straight week (4-122, albeit his 66-yard score came in total garbage time).\n\nRemember, A.J. Green will eventually be back in this offense. Dalton is locked in as a Superflex quarterback for now and could push for QB1 consideration, depending on how stuck you are with your primary guy. Those rostering Cam Newton and Jameis Winston might want to take a look, not to mention anyone rostering a recently-injured quarterback (we\u2019re playing the waiting game with Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees).\n\nThe early Cincinnati schedule has some potholes, to be fair. A nasty trip to Buffalo looms, and the Bengals also have two Baltimore games in the first half of the schedule. But with a much-needed offensive remodel, Dalton has a realistic shot at relevance.\n\nChiefs dominate one quarter, coast to victory\n\nYou don\u2019t thumb your nose up at any wins in the NFL, but the Chiefs looked somewhat bored in their 28-10 victory at Oakland. Kansas City spotted Oakland a 10-point lead in the first quarter, then hit the hosts with a 28-point blitz in the second period. After that, no more scoring \u2014 for anyone. Just tackles on the infield dirt, Halloween in the stands, and running out the clock.\n\nPatrick Mahomes once again looks like an unfair weapon \u2014 443 passing yards, four touchdowns, 131.2 rating. But it\u2019s interesting that Sammy Watkins (6-49-0, 13 targets) was the one major part of the KC passing game that couldn\u2019t get on track. Meanwhile, Demarcus Robinson had a breakout game (6-172-2), Travis Kelce looked like the uncoverable freak he is (7-107-1), and Mecole Hardman came to play (4-61-1). Watkins is too talented not to rebound, but I never accepted he was an automatic Top 10 wideout in the post-Tyreek Hill offense. Season to taste.\n\nStill, to be fair, it\u2019s the one position defined by booms and busts. Heck, it\u2019s the name of the column.\n\nThe best thing I can say about there Raiders is that Josh Jacobs ran well (12-99-0), and the passing targets were mostly skimmed to three guys: emerging tight end Darren Waller, Tyrell Williams, and Hunter Renfrow (4-30-0, but he did get eight targets). Oakland isn\u2019t likely to have a dynamic offense, but at least the coaching staff is streamlining the usage.\n\nPatriots spread around their 43 points\n\nGiven that the Patriots dump-trucked the tanking Dolphins, 43-0, there weren\u2019t a ton of fantasy winners. Off-brand touchdowns gummed up the works \u2014 Tom Brady had a rushing score (in addition to two touchdown passes), and the New England defense tackled on two late runback scores. The rest of New England\u2019s offense was filled with pars (Antonio Brown, Sony Michel, James White) and bogeys (Rex Burkhead, Julian Edelman, Josh Gordon). Beware the wide usage tree.\n\nThe Cowboys and Chargers get to tee off on Miami the next two weeks. Other than Preston Williams\u2019s credible 4-63-0 day (six targets), there wasn\u2019t a single Dolphins skill player who had a quality game. This is one of the worst NFL rosters we\u2019ve seen in the fantasy era. Miami somehow crammed four interceptions and seven sacks into 46 dropbacks.\n\nQuick Hitters\n\n\u2022 Talk about the most Chargers drive ever \u2014 two wiped-out touchdowns, and then Austin Ekeler fumbles at the one. The Chargers commonly are the most talented team that doesn\u2019t make the playoffs \u2014 and you could easily see that again.\n\n\u2022 A sore wrist cost David Johnson some snaps, but the most frustrating thing from his day was seeing the Cardinals target him just once. You can only get so much out of touchdown deodorant when you handle the ball just eight times.\n\n\u2022 Kirk Cousins is just good enough to lose with. Loose throws off the back foot, in the red zone no less \u2014 you\u2019re supposed to have those inclinations ironed out of your game by now. Obviously the Vikings have two talented wideouts, but Dalvin Cook is the only player in this offense that I can start with any confidence.\n\n\u2022 Aaron Rodgers didn\u2019t make the big mistake and of course we respect the Minnesota defense, but a 6.1 YPA leaves you cold. Remember, he didn\u2019t play particularly well last year, either.\n\n\u2022 The Jaguars did the right thing at the end of their loss at Houston \u2014 as a heavy underdog, going for two is the right move. You also have the backboard of an onside kick if things fail, as unlikely as a non-surprise kick tends to be. Gardner Minshew had some good throws and some loose throws in his first career start, but the moment definitely didn\u2019t seem too big for him. He could have a decade-long career, even if it\u2019s not primarily as a starter.\n\n\u2022 All Devin Singletary does is make plays, but six carries is not defensible \u2014 not when Frank Gore touches the ball 21 times. I\u2019m still a Singletary buyer, but at 2-0, the Bills might not be incentivized to make changes.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t look now, but the Colts usage tree looks especially wide. Ten players were targeted Sunday. Jordan Wilkins, of all people, snuck six touches. Jacoby Brissett is also going to run a bit. I like the team much more than I like the individual players, other than T.Y. Hilton and Marlon Mack.\n\n\u2022 I have almost no Terry McLaurin, and it drives me nuts. No one hides and holds back elite wideouts like Ohio State. He\u2019s quickly picked up an advanced understanding of the route tree, and the Redskins have made him a prioritized target.\n\nFollow Scott Pianowski on Twitter", "description": "Scott Pianowski identifies the successes and failures of Week 2, including Kyle Shanahan's and the 49ers' demolition of the Bengals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/w0UKTswvXBOwiYgumPhZ4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03OTAuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ehl2WGSq5.5TDhdXL28gSw--~B/aD0zMzAwO3c9NTM0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/8dc30940-d80b-11e9-b4c5-eb1901d978d8", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
