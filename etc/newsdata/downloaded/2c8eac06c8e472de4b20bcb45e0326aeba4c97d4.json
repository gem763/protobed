We\u2019re getting out of the endless wars. We have to do it,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office. \u201cWe are out of there. We\u2019ve been out of there for a while. No soldiers whatsoever.\u201d He added on Thursday, \u201cWe have no soldiers in Syria.\u201d\n\nThat is untrue.\n\nTwo knowledgeable U.S. officials confirmed to The Daily Beast that after a shocking week that has upended U.S. planning, the U.S. military has only pulled back from northern Syria, not pulled out. It\u2019s abandoned two small observation posts in the area Turkey has now invaded. Around 50 service members have moved to a larger base, something both officials described as a force protection measure\u2014protection amid the already bloody Turkish incursion, protection that no longer exists for the Kurdish force that the U.S. relied upon to assault the so-called Islamic State. None of the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops have actually left Syria since Trump\u2019s fateful Sunday phone call with Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Invasion of Kurdish-Controlled Syrian Territory Stalls as Soon as It Starts, but for How Long?\n\nInstead, the U.S. military is currently in a holding pattern in Syria, one that many with experience in the endless wars that have ravaged a generation of Americans, Iraqis, Syrians and others consider a wrenching position. While actual withdrawal orders may yet come, for the beginning phase of Turkey\u2019s attack on the Syrian Kurds, the Americans have ended no war, nor even their involvement in one. Instead, they\u2019ve stood aside so their NATO ally can kill their anti-ISIS partner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the tactical rationale for this,\u201d said a former Pentagon official. \u201cWe\u2019ve just exposed our partners. It\u2019s a struggle for people of a \u2018globalist,\u2019 institutionalist [bent] \u2013 people who fought and bled with our partners \u2013 to understand.\u201d\n\nMultiple ex-Pentagon officials point out that the writing has been on the wall for the U.S. in Syria since December, when senior military officers and their civilian counterparts in the administration and Congress convinced Trump to delay his pullout. That was what caused Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and State Department anti-ISIS chief Brett McGurk to resign from the administration. In his June confirmation hearing, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley, told senators that only \u201ca modest amount of [military] capability\u201d remained necessary in Syria.\n\nBut the writing on the wall has yet to materialize in actual orders to bring the troops home. It fits the pattern that Trump has set throughout his presidency: talking about ending the wars but falling short of actually ending any. More typically, he\u2019s instead escalated the endless wars he inherited, in terms of both money and violence. In Syria, Trump has upended plans from the summer that appeared to forestall a Turkish invasion against the Kurds by jointly establishing and patrolling a \u201csafe zone\u201d from which Kurdish forces pulled back.\n\nAlleged \u2018Dove\u2019 Donald Trump Will Increase War Funding by 139 Percent\n\n\u201cWe thought it was a good compromise outcome,\u201d a senior State Department official told reporters on Thursday.\n\nNow, according to a U.S. official, the military is observing the carnage with its drones and other surveillance aircraft overhead. Ostensibly, service members are watching to see if and how ISIS will exploit Turkey\u2019s invasion. What they will do in the event of an ISIS offensive is anything but clear.\n\nAside from that, the U.S. in Syria is in the process of taking custody of ISIS detainees that the Syrian Democratic Forces have held and, with Turkey pursuing them, no longer prioritize. But out of 11,000 held, the U.S. is moving only 50 so-called high value detainees to its facilities in Iraq. Doing so creates a legal complication. The longer they are held without charge, the greater the likelihood they can challenge the basis for their detention in U.S. federal court, and potentially prompt a judge\u2019s ruling that the congressionally-undeclared war is illegal. Trump, in his Oval Office remarks, shrugged at the idea of a mass ISIS prisoner release, on the notion that \u201cthey're going to be escaping to Europe. That's where they want to go.\u201d", "description": "To listen to President Donald Trump and his defenders, he\u2019s ended a foolish and previously indefinite war in Syria. \u201cWe have no soldiers in the area, you know.\u00a0 We\u2019re getting out of the endless wars.
