Protection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance,\" said ICO Deputy Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone.\n\n\"We are pleased to hear that Facebook has taken, and will continue to take, significant steps to comply with the fundamental principles of data protection.\"\n\nFacebook said it was pleased to have reached a settlement and the company wished it had done more to investigate the claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015.\n\n\"We made major changes to our platform back then, significantly restricting the information app developers could access,\" said Harry Kinmouth, Facebook's Associate General Counsel.\n\n\"Protecting people's information and privacy is a top priority for Facebook, and we are continuing to build new controls to help people protect and manage their information.\"\n\nRobert Ramsden Board, VP of EMEA at Securonix, claims that the fine should act as a 'wake up call' to other organisations.\n\nHe said: \"For a long time, Facebook appeared immune to privacy regulations and concerns. However, the numerous fines the platform has been facing recently for the misuse of peoples\u2019 data marks a change in attitudes as people become more concerned about how their personal data is held and used online.\n\n\"Regulators will continue to hold Facebook responsible for protecting the privacy of its users, therefore, the ICO fine should act as wake up call to other organisations that customer data privacy is of fundamental importance.\n\n\"The good news is that Facebook does seem to be taking these concerns on board and is working to make security and privacy changes across the platform to help protect its users.\u201d", "description": "Facebook has agreed to pay a \u00a3500,000 ($644,000) fine for breaches of data protection law related to the harvesting of data by consultancy Cambridge Analytica", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12226065.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/26_Social-Media-Apps-And-Computer-Keyboards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
