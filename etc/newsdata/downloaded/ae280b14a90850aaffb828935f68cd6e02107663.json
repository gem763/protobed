I wasn\u2019t sure if that was the end of our affair, but then he called from America and invited me to Paris. I managed to get there and find the hotel, only to be told that there was no Mr Wood in residence and, in any case, they were fully booked for Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter Fashion Week.\n\nI must have looked desperate, because the man on reception eventually took pity on me and said I could stay in one of the maids\u2019 rooms. I had no money, so I lay there all night wondering how I was going to get out of there the next day without getting caught.\n\nAt 6am I got a phone call from reception.\n\n'I felt a bit sorry for Mick as I think he had his photo taken so often he could live without the attention, but the rest of the Stones never minded'\n\nOn tour in the US with Ronnie\u2019s band the New Barbarians, 1979: \u2018That\u2019s after a gig. It would have been taken by \u201cChuch\u201d, Ronnie\u2019s roadie. Chuch was with Ronnie until the day he died. He had a heart attack on tour in 2003. He was found dead on a flight case with the guitars underneath him. He was only 54\u2019\n\nIn Paris with baby Leah, 1979: \u2018This is a Polaroid taken in the apartment we rented just off the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. We went back a few times when the band recorded at the Path\u00e9-Marconi studios\u2019\n\nKeith Richards with saxophonist Bobby Keys (right) in his bedroom at the rear of the Rolling Stones\u2019 private jet. \u2018Keith commandeered the room and he\u2019d lie there as the plane took off. We\u2019d all congregate on the bed once we were flying\u2019\n\n\u2018Is that Mademoiselle Karslake?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes. I mean, oui.\u2019\n\n\u2018We \u2019ave a Monsieur Wood down \u2019ere asking for you. Shall I send him up?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, that would be wonderful.\u2019\n\nI put on my sarong and, before I knew it, there was Ronnie at the door with a big smile on his face, telling me he was sorry. Concorde had blown an engine and they\u2019d had to make a landing in Ireland.\n\nWhile he\u2019s saying that, some other bloke shoves past us into the room. He didn\u2019t even look at me, just sat on the floor at the end of the bed, rummaging in a doctor\u2019s bag.\n\nHe pulled out a silver spoon, a bottle of pills and a lighter. In a few seconds he\u2019d filled a syringe and injected himself straight through his jacket. There was a tiny pause while the drugs hit his system and then he looked up at me and said, \u2018How very nice to meet you, my dear. I\u2019ve heard such a lot about you.\u2019\n\nAnd that\u2019s the story of how I met Keith Richards for the first time.\n\nThere\u2019s a photo in my book of Ronnie and me in Paris (see above). It was the first picture of us together, but definitely not the last \u2013 so much so that I\u2019ve been able to fill a book with photographs and mementos from my life with the Rolling Stones.\n\nWherever we went, I always liked to carry a camera. In the early days I used a Polaroid. The only problem was that you didn\u2019t get a negative, which meant if you lost the picture, it was gone for ever. I shudder to think what I\u2019ve lost in transit.\n\nNot long after we started going out, Ronnie bought me a \u2018proper\u2019 camera, and I took so many pictures that he started to call me the Shutterbug. I felt a bit sorry for Mick as I think he had his photo taken so often he could live without the attention, but the rest of the Stones never minded.\n\nI used to drag carrier bags full of film canisters to the developers whenever we got off tour. I can imagine them printing those pictures, expecting them to be somebody\u2019s boring holiday snaps and then suddenly realising they were looking at the Rolling Stones and their mates. I made sure I used photographic shops that I trusted because, obviously, there was all sorts of stuff going on in the pics.\n\nI\u2019d been in front of the camera as a model, so it was fun to be the one taking the photos. When I first met Ronnie in 1977, I was 22 and living in London during the week, running around doing auditions and shoots while my mum looked after my little boy Jamie back home in Essex.\n\nRonnie had walked straight up to me at a party in Kensington and started chatting. He said, \u2018Do you know who I am?\u2019 and then whipped out a copy of the Stones album Black And Blue, pointing himself out on the cover. I just thought, \u2018Oh my God, this guy deserves to be put in his place for being so full of himself.\u2019 So I told him I worked in Woolworths on the broken biscuit counter, and he spent hours the next day standing on Oxford Street waiting for me to finish work, before somehow tracking me down at my flat.\n\nRonnie sleeps on as daylight streams in... \u2018Ronnie asleep in an extremely messy room. That\u2019s got to be 1981, because that was the messiest tour, and I remember thinking, I never want to be so unorganised again. We used to hang clothes up in the window, because I\u2019d prefer them to be out than shoved in a wardrobe and then forgotten when we left. Note the sunlight coming through the window\u2019\n\nOn holiday in Jamaica, early Eighties. \u2018I think that\u2019s such a great picture. Leah with a fag in her mouth. Not lit, of course. She was fascinated with her father\u2019s cigarettes. She doesn\u2019t smoke now \u2013 thank goodness for that\u2019\n\nOur little girl is sung a lullaby... by Keith Richards! Keith serenading Leah, on tour, 1981: \u2018I adore Keith, he is wonderful. He is a very loyal person \u2013 loyal to his friends and family. His tough exterior? Oh, that\u2019s just an act\u2019\n\nThe thing that got me about Ronnie was that he was very funny. He kept following me from room to room, chatting away. When I went to get a drink, I looked in the mirror and I could see Ronnie in the reflection, jokingly pretending to hump me from behind. I thought, \u2018This guy is absolutely nuts.\u2019\n\nWhen Keith and Ronnie arrived in Paris that morning, I learned that they came as a package. We spent all day chatting and drinking and God knows what time we went to bed. I woke up in the middle of the night, hugging Ronnie, and Keith was there, asleep at the end of the bed. When Keith woke up, he said, \u2018Let\u2019s go to my apartment.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe he had an apartment in Paris and we\u2019d all been sleeping in this tiny room.\n\nKeith was very naughty. He had a Bentley that we used to drive around Paris in. It was a very different time then, and it\u2019s hard to believe now that it didn\u2019t occur to us that drink-driving might be a problem. We\u2019d just get in the car and drive off at seven in the morning after a night in the studio.\n\nI found Keith fascinating. His sense of humour was, and is, brilliant. We\u2019d go days without food or sleep, then we\u2019d realise we were starving and Keith would say, \u2018Let\u2019s go to Fouquet\u2019s\u2019, a really posh restaurant he loved on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. We must have looked such a motley crew.\n\nIn the early days, I would stay in the studio all night long with the band while they recorded. We often didn\u2019t finish until 11 in the morning, though that changed later on \u2013 Mick didn\u2019t like the all-nighters. I built a little club room with a notice on the door saying \u2018Jo\u2019s Club\u2019, and I\u2019d have drinks and joints ready for Ronnie and Keith when they took a break.\n\nRonnie and I had only been together for six weeks when I found out that I was pregnant with our daughter Leah \u2013 which was both a complete shock and a total joy. Ronnie and I decided that we would make a go of it as a couple and moved into a rented house in the Hollywood Hills with a swimming pool in the living room. The Stones were touring over there and it seemed the right place to be for Ronnie\u2019s career.\n\nRonnie feels the heat in the dressing room: On tour in America in 1981. \u2018Ronnie\u2019s trick for making sure his hair stayed up was to use fresh lemon juice, followed by a blow-dry. To be fair to him, it worked a treat \u2013 his hair stayed right where he wanted it\u2019\n\nMy great expectations: Pregnant with daughter Leah, Los Angeles, 1978. \u2018I think I was about six months pregnant then. We hadn\u2019t known each other much longer than that, but we didn\u2019t even think about it. Wasn\u2019t even a big deal. It was just, \u201cOK, we\u2019re going to have a baby\u201d\u2019\n\nGet off of my cloud! Mick toasts his birthday with a glitzy mid-air party: On the Stones\u2019 private jet, early Nineties. \u2018We made a fuss of birthdays on the road, and Mick loved to have a good party for his. Keith would prefer to stay in\u2019\n\nJagger\u2019s winning smile: Mick Jagger in LA, 1978. \u2018There\u2019s Mick, not long after I met the Stones. All these pictures have been in boxes for years. I\u2019ve got thousands. A friend said, \u2018You have to do something with these\u2026\u2019\n\nAfter a few months we bought a place in Mandeville Canyon and Keith moved in there too. He realised there was a little guest house in the back and thought, \u2018That\u2019ll do for me.\u2019\n\nThe day that Leah was born, Keith came to the hospital as well. The nurse asked which of Ronnie and Keith was the father and they both said, \u2018I am.\u2019\n\nKeith had just given up heroin. He\u2019d been using it for a long time but he\u2019d got busted and he knew that if he didn\u2019t stop they\u2019d put him in jail soon. It\u2019s amazing how determined he was to quit. After going cold turkey, he emerged like a butterfly from a cocoon. It was incredible to see; he was funnier, happier and cooler than ever before.\n\nI remember the first thing he wanted to do after getting clean was meet a girl. He\u2019d never shown any interest before, but now he suddenly asked me if I had any mates I could introduce him to. I knew someone called Lil, who was doing some modelling in New York, so I called her and invited her up.\n\nShe was keen on meeting him, so Keith hired a chopper and just flew me to New York to pick her up \u2013 that was just the way things were. They got on like a house on fire and went out with each other for a couple of years.\n\nOur family holiday horror In February 1980 we went to the island of St Martin in the Caribbean with the kids. The idea was that we\u2019d have a healthy holiday, but instead we spent six days and six nights in jail. They were the longest six days of my life. One night at a casino, we met two guys, Franco and Mustapha, and had a bit of a chat with them. St Martin is not exactly a big island and a couple of days later they knocked on our door. It turned out they had lots of particularly good cocaine and the healthy holiday went right out of the window. We stayed up all night and, at six in the morning, they asked to borrow our rental car to drop off a friend of theirs. They came back, returned our car and left. We didn\u2019t think any more about it, but later that day I looked out of the bathroom window and there were all these police in the garden. Ronnie thought we had the music on too loud, but they swarmed into the house, arrested us and took us off to jail. I was locked up in an awful cell with a concrete slab to sleep on. It turned out that Franco and Mustapha were big-time dealers. When they borrowed our car, they\u2019d picked up a huge bag of coke, which for some reason they\u2019d stashed in a tree in our garden. A security guard saw them and reported it to the police. We didn\u2019t know any of that and I was told horror stories by the other prisoners that I\u2019d be inside for months. Eventually, our lawyer got us in front of the judge. He was very stern and asked me if I\u2019d taken drugs. I put on my innocent face and said I\u2019d tried them for the first time that night. He gave me a very stern talking-to, told me off for being silly\u2026 and then just let us go. No charges, no cautions, nothing. We were so lucky \u2013 he must have realised we were basically victims of circumstance. How it didn\u2019t end up in the papers I\u2019ll never know. It would have been really difficult to have a drugs bust on our records. I remember it made me really think. I said, \u2018I\u2019m never going to do anything like that again.\u2019 And I stuck to that \u2013 for a few days at least.\n\nWe didn\u2019t see that much of Mick in LA though, as he was always on the move, while Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman stayed in England. But life was great. My son Jamie came to live with us, we had baby Leah and this beautiful house, and there were always loads of interesting people around.\n\nWhen I finally threw Keith out of our guest house it wasn\u2019t personal, but he had to go as I\u2019d just had a baby! He wrote me an IOU note which I still have, promising to buy me two pistols for my birthday, and while I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever had any interest in firearms, clearly the thought was there from him.\n\nThe Stones organisation is a big machine, but within it is a family, and we had some amazing times together. Jerry Hall and I had worked together as models, and we\u2019d always got on, so it was great when she got together with Mick around the same time I started to see Ronnie. She was my first girlfriend in the band and I\u2019m still very fond of her.\n\nPatti Hansen came along in the early Eighties and she and I bonded straight away. Keith told us he was seeing someone new and we went to meet her one night after a session in the studio. She opened the door to her apartment wearing only men\u2019s pyjama trousers and jumped into Keith\u2019s arms with a big grin on her face. I thought, \u2018This girl is cool,\u2019 and she looked so beautiful. It\u2019s funny how certain moments in your life can stick in your head like a photograph.\n\nJerry Hall in the guitar roadies\u2019 workstation on the 1989-90 Steel Wheels tour. \u2018I always loved taking pictures of Jerry Hall. I met her before I met Mick, on a French perfume commercial. She was already a famous model who had gone out with Bryan Ferry\u2019\n\nKeith and Leah, on tour, 1992. \u2018On a plane, obviously after a show, just Leah cuddling with her lovely Keith. This photo is an absolute favourite of mine. We were all one family, especially with the kids on tour\u2019\n\nGoing on tour was a whole new world. My first full tour with Ronnie was with his band the New Barbarians, which also featured Keith. It was a mad tour, which cost Ronnie a fortune because he insisted on using private planes wherever we went.\n\nIt all seemed to be one big party, one big laugh and adventure. I\u2019d be lying if I said I remembered everything \u2013 I look at some of the photos and have no idea where we were. I have to refer to what people were wearing, what my hair was like and how skinny I was to work out when it was.\n\nTouring with the Stones had its own set of traditions. When we travelled by road, we went by limo, and we always made sure the car was stocked with plenty of alcohol. On the Stones\u2019 private jet, Keith would commandeer the bedroom at the back, and he\u2019d lie there as the plane took off, with cigarettes and drinks to hand and we\u2019d all congregate on the bed once we were up in the air. But the entertainment wasn\u2019t all wild as Mick and Bill would play backgammon on the plane and they used to have tournaments against each other.\n\nYou never knew who would turn up backstage \u2013 old friends or big stars, artists, sportspeople or film stars \u2013 so I worked as Ronnie\u2019s little bouncer. At first I was a bit timid about getting rid of people, but as time went on I had no trouble doing it. You\u2019d throw them out and the band would have time on their own, have a drink and then, boom, stage time.\n\nAfter the Stones finished touring Tattoo You in Europe, Ronnie and I moved to Manhattan in 82 as LA had become too crazy, plus Keith was in New York and he wanted his buddy there. Mick was there too.\n\nWe found a lovely old brownstone house on West 78th Street, a couple of streets down from where Mick lived. We dug out the basement and put a studio in, and we used to get all sorts of interesting musicians coming round to visit. David Bowie hung out there, and Ringo Starr, Bob Dylan and Sly Stone all came round. It was a really good party house.\n\nAt Ronnie\u2019s birthday party, Andy Warhol was walking round with this camera he\u2019d painted in different colours, taking photos of people. He took a picture of me and I regret never taking one back of him. I\u2019d love to know what happened to his photos from that night.\n\nMy only appearance in a Rolling Stones video came at that time. The song was the 1983 single She Was Hot. I asked Mick if there was a part for me and he said, \u2018Let me think about it.\u2019 A bit later he said, \u2018Go to make-up tomorrow morning.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Woo-hoo! A sexy part in the video,\u2019 but when I went there, they made me up as the old wife of Bill Wyman. Thanks for that, Mick.\n\nWe stayed in New York for four years but it was always a bit hairy. You had to be particularly careful if you went downtown. One night, I saw a bunch of kids smashing the windscreen of a car outside our house. I opened the window and screamed at them, \u2018What the f*** are you doing?\u2019, and they looked up and held their knives up at me. That was it for me, it was time to go home, so we sold the house for a terrible price and hit the road back to London. Keith was furious that we left, but it had to be done.\n\nThere was friction between Mick and Keith in the Eighties, but Ronnie finally got the two of them to talk to each other and that proved to be a breakthrough. He was on the phone to Keith and then to Mick, encouraging them both to speak to each other, and the next thing I knew they were rehearsing together. Suddenly there was going to be an album, called Steel Wheels, and we were going back on the road, this time with all the kids. Whenever they had a summer holiday, it was nearly always touring the world.\n\nBeing on the road from 1989 onwards was amazing compared to when we\u2019d last toured in 82. Back then it was rock \u2019n\u2019 roll madness, and Ronnie would wander on stage wearing whatever I\u2019d brought to the gig. One time we were woken by security because we were late for a show. The band were four hours late going on stage that night and I was amazed that people waited so long to see them.\n\nBy the late Eighties it was totally different. Now there were wardrobe and make-up rooms and everything had to run to schedule. Everyone had their own van for getting to and from the gigs, while in the past we\u2019d all bundle in a vehicle with Keith.\n\nI loved touring, but I never found it difficult at the end of a tour to return home. I\u2019d come back, make beans on toast and switch into normal life. It was much harder for Ronnie. He struggled to adjust because he\u2019d miss the adrenaline and admiration that you got every night on the road.\n\nWhen I started compiling this book and looking through all the photos and mementos I\u2019d hoarded, I had so much stuff that I couldn\u2019t include everything. Now, with the passing of time, I can see what an incredible world I was a part of. I\u2019m not massively nostalgic but when I look at the pictures it feels so long ago, like a totally different life.\n\nThere are friends in there who are no longer with us, people like Bobby Womack and John Belushi, but I just feel so lucky to have met them and lived the life I have done. I don\u2019t look at their pictures and dwell on them, feeling sad that they\u2019re gone. I just think of how much fun we had.\n\n\u2018Stoned\u2019 by Jo Wood is published by Cassell on October 31, priced \u00a320. Offer price \u00a316 (20 per cent discount) until November 19 2019.
