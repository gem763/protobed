We had a really easy first three hours, to the point that I thought we would all be home by 7pm.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t remember what happened next.\n\n\u201cI lost five hours of my life and it was a pretty complicated birth in the end.\u201d\n\nThe former pop star has said she does not take the pleasures of motherhood for granted, and is cherishing moments with young Apollo \u2013 born on August 1 - because she knows how fleeting they can be.\n\n\u201cHaving a baby in your 40s is an extremely different experience,\u201d she told.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\u201cI love the night feeds - it\u2019s a privilege to look at his little face during the night. I know how quickly this will go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m loving every single minute. I even miss my baby bump.\u201d\n\nApollo is the first child for Myleene and her partner Simon, 45, a fashion PR. Like her, he has two children from his previous marriage.\n\nMyleene\u2019s former husband Graham Quinn, father of her two daughters, walked out on her just six months after their wedding.
