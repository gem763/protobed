With such a natural lining up of his interests, Trump turned the event into a spectacle, even promoting the press conference on Twitter the night before.\n\nAnytime President Trump speaks for 48 minutes straight, the appearance is going to get pretty unhinged \u2014 which, on Sunday, began about 90 seconds in, when he described the ISIS leader \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way\u201d to the back of a tunnel in his compound, where he detonated a suicide vest as he was surrounded by three of his children. The president, who did little to hide his enjoyment in the moment, said that \u201cit was just like a movie.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments on al-Baghdadi, if there was a strategy to them, dehumanized the leader responsible for the Yazidi genocide, systemized sex slavery, and the deaths of thousands in the region. \u201cHe was a gutless animal,\u201d Trump said, later adding that \u201che died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying.\u201d He employed one of his frequent, if incoherent, jabs at al-Baghdadi, claiming that he \u201cdied like a dog.\u201d In a bizarre piece of symmetry, as Trump degraded the terrorist, he elevated a military canine involved in the raid: \u201cOur K-9, as they call it \u2014 I call it a dog, a beautiful dog, a talented dog \u2014 was injured and brought back, but we had no soldier injured \u2026 We had nobody even hurt. That\u2019s why the dog was so great.\u201d\n\nIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \"died like a dog\" in a raid by US special forces in northwest Syria, President Donald Trump has announced. pic.twitter.com/sx9Dp8Pd4n \u2014 SBS News (@SBSNews) October 27, 2019\n\nTrump also took the occasion of his administration\u2019s greatest national-security victory to date to celebrate himself. After explaining the Islamic State\u2019s achievement in recruiting disaffected young men online, he complimented the terrorist organization: \u201cYou know, they use the internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump.\u201d Then came a blur of sentences imaginable only by the president himself: \u201cAnd what they\u2019ve done with the internet through recruiting and everything \u2014 and that\u2019s why he died like a dog, he died like a coward. He was whimpering, screaming and crying. And frankly that\u2019s something that should be brought out.\u201d\n\nHe also found a way to weave in a few historical retellings, claiming that \u201cif you read about the history of Donald Trump, I was a civilian. I had absolutely nothing to do with going into Iraq and I was totally against it.\u201d That\u2019s a standard Trump lie, though the next one was new to the canon: \u201cI wrote a book. A really very successful book. And in that book, about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said there\u2019s somebody named Osama bin Laden, you better kill him or take him out, something to that effect, he\u2019s big trouble \u2026 And I\u2019m saying to people, take out Osama bin Laden, that nobody ever heard of.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the transcript of Trump\u2019s entirely fictional tale about how \u201cnobody\u201d had heard of \u201chandsome\u201d Osama bin Laden until Trump demanded his death in a 2000 book, but nobody listened, and people still marvel at his prescience, \u201cit\u2019s true,\u201d\n\nand the press won\u2019t report all this. pic.twitter.com/qfMNBbZyBX \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 27, 2019\n\nPresident Trump was certainly aware of the moment looming from eight years ago \u2014 when President Obama more professionally announced the death of bin Laden \u2014 and maturely claimed that his terrorist death outdid that of his predecessor. \u201cThis is the worst ever,\u201d he said. \u201cOsama bin Laden was very big but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole \u2014 as he would like to call it \u2014 a country, a caliphate. And was trying to do it again.\u201d\n\nDehumanizing enemies, claiming to upstage Obama, celebrating details of war like they existed only on television \u2014 the press conference seemed to hit peak Trump by the end, though his campaign soon added to the performance. Hours later, Trump was fundraising on the death of al-Baghdadi, making it doubtful that he will take the advice he gave during the 2012 election, when he suggested people stop congratulating Obama for the death of bin Laden.\n\n\u201cFriend,\n\n\n\nIt is a great day for the United States of America, and for the rest of the world.\n\n\n\nUnder the fierce leadership of our Commander-in-Chief, the radical ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.\u201d \u2014 Trump Fundraising Emails (@TrumpEmail) October 27, 2019", "description": "At President Trump\u2019s press conference announcing the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, he brought everything he had: dehumanizing enemies, claims of upstaging Obama, and celebrating violence like it only existed on TV .", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/21/trump_isis.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
