Examples included the UK and the US.\n\nThe firm expects increased costs early in fiscal 2020, after a new wage model and additional consultancy costs.\n\nLower than expected profits from emerging in-destination businesses are also a factor, as are lower interest earnings which reflects lower yields in Australia and higher interest repayments.\n\nThe firm will take $7 million costs after the collapse of Thomas Cook, associated with reaccommodating customers to ensure they were not affected by the collapse of Bentours and Tempo Holidays in Australia.\n\nIt added that online leisure sales had doubled in the country during the three months to September 30.\n\nFlight Centre will release fiscal 2020 profit guidance at its annual general meeting on November 7.", "description": "Australian shares have fallen heavily at the open; Flight Centre warns on profit; Lazard's Aaron Binsted discusses the stock he's quietly excited about.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9934%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bfc9e4261990bc46700788b87b38c3e68c3aa44f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
