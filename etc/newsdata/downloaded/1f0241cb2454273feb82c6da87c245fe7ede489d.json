(Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nOne week ago, with Hurricane Dorian swirling in the Atlantic off the coast of Florida, President Trump\u2019s mistake about there being a risk to Alabama was a quick flash that hadn\u2019t attracted much attention. He\u2019d tweeted about that risk well after any serious threat had passed, but since he\u2019d done so on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend, few people noticed. A number of people in Alabama did, however, and they called in to local authorities, prompting the National Weather Service in Birmingham to clarify publicly that no such threat still existed. As of Monday afternoon of last week, that\u2019s where it lay.\n\nUntil Trump decided to complain publicly about an ABC News report noting the Alabama mistake. That Monday evening, the president disparaged ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl as a \u201clightweight,\u201d insisting Alabama was at risk. It was a refrain he kept up all week, heightening the conflict by altering an old hurricane map with a marker to make Alabama appear to be more at risk and, later, changing his claims to center on the threat of wind damage. At the time of his tweet, Alabama faced a small chance of 40 mph winds, a threat that has become the formal rationalization for Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nMore importantly, though, we\u2019ve seen how Trump and his administration have attempted to police this nonsensical claim.\n\nAfter Trump altered that hurricane map from the Oval Office, the White House released a statement from Coast Guard Rear Adm. Peter Brown, the president\u2019s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser. The statement from Brown insisted \u201c[t]he President\u2019s comments were based on that morning\u2019s Hurricane Dorian briefing, which included the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama.\u201d CNN later reported Brown had been ordered by Trump to issue the statement.\n\nAgain, the tweet at issue asserted Alabama and states along the Eastern Seaboard would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by \u201cone of the largest hurricanes ever.\u201d The claim came after the threat of a direct hit on Alabama had passed and while the only threat was that 1-in-10 shot at a strong breeze.\n\nStoked by repeated tweets from Trump, the controversy continued to burble. Late Friday afternoon, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a statement similarly defending Trump\u2019s claim on the grounds that a small threat of stronger-than-normal winds existed. It further chastised the National Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham office for having contradicted Trump in its initial response.\n\nIt was a remarkable enlistment of an objective, science-based agency to the defense of Trump\u2019s false presentation about the risk to Alabama. Having a member of the military, of which the president is commander in chief, step out in Trump\u2019s defense is one thing. Having the scientific agency that makes the hurricane maps do it is another thing entirely.\n\nThere was immediate backlash, with NOAA officials and employees internally criticizing the unsigned Friday statement and alumni of the organization doing so publicly. The organization\u2019s chief scientist informed staff in an email that he would investigate where the statement originated.\n\nAs the New York Times first reported on Monday, there was reportedly pressure from above. The NOAA is part of the Commerce Department, led by Secretary Wilbur Ross. The Times reported that Ross threatened to fire top NOAA officials for the NWS Birmingham contradiction only hours before the statement was released. Ross, of course, serves at the pleasure of Trump.\n\nWe can put all of this more simply. Trump made a mistake and, faced with objective analysis showing that he was wrong, attempted to mislead the public on Twitter and by showing a doctored map, asked a senior official to defend his untrue claim and benefited from his commerce secretary putting pressure on the organization that generated the objective analysis.\n\nIt\u2019s at moments like this that it\u2019s worth remembering how Trump came to the White House. His background was not in Congress or elected office, where he\u2019d have some familiarity with power-sharing and constituent accountability. His background was, instead, at his eponymous privately held company, where he was accountable to no one but himself. It was the business-world equivalent of a dictatorship, and it was where he spent decades exerting power.\n\nThe bizarre fight over Trump\u2019s Alabama tweet, otherwise known as Sharpiegate, reveals how Trump struggles against wielding power under a different type of structure. He wants the government to respond in the way the Trump Organization would have: complete fealty, however obviously contradictory the product of that fealty might be.\n\nHe\u2019s had more luck bringing another institution into line: the Republican Party.\n\nTrump\u2019s Monday started with a smattering of claims not related to Alabama and Dorian. Included among them was the apparently out-of-the-blue claim that he had 94 percent approval among Republicans, which he doesn\u2019t.\n\nWhere did that come from? It came from his concerns about a number of Republicans who have announced primary challenges against him, most recently former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford. Speaking to reporters before traveling to a campaign rally in North Carolina, Trump made the explicit link between his possibly made-up approval number and his concerns about a primary challenger.\n\n\u201cWe just got, right \u2014 a little while ago, 94 percent popularity or approval rating within the Republican Party,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, to be honest, I\u2019m not looking to give them any credibility. They have no credibility.\u201d After having said he didn\u2019t know who his possible GOP opponents were, he then disparaged each of the announced challengers in specific terms.\n\nThat came on the heels of a more revealing shift within the party Trump leads. During the weekend, the Republican Party organizations in Nevada and in Sanford\u2019s home state of South Carolina announced they would not hold presidential nominating contests in 2020, joining Kansas.\n\nThis isn\u2019t without precedent as a maneuver; as recently as 2004, the GOP shut down primaries \u2014 ostensibly to save money but with an understanding that it would help incumbent President George W. Bush. As party-primary researcher Josh Putnam pointed out on Twitter, though, these new moves are slightly different.\n\n\u201cThese are state-level actions with some input from the national party level and the reelection effort,\u201d he wrote. But while past presidents have shut down primaries, this new effort \u201chas been fueled by just how controversial the president is. Trump has fed into that.\u201d\n\nWhile talking to reporters on Monday, Trump claimed he had \u201cnothing to do with\u201d the states shutting down their primaries (a claim he has made about a lot of things, often falsely). He then went on to describe his challengers as \u201ca total joke. They\u2019re a joke. They\u2019re a laughingstock.\u201d\n\nClearly Trump doesn\u2019t think that the party should have to present options to Republican voters for a decision to be made, any more than he thinks government agencies should be in the habit of contradicting him. He\u2019s probably not wrong that those opponents don\u2019t have much of a chance, but, to him, it must seem a bit like asking Trump Organization employees to vote on who should serve as CEO. He\u2019s going to win \u2014 but it might not be with the 94 percent mandate that he claims, and wouldn\u2019t that be embarrassing?\n\nThere are all sorts of obvious problems that trickle outward from this approach to governance, but none are more revealing than the one that flows from Trump\u2019s assertions about his Alabama tweet. The NWS office in Birmingham contradicted Trump not out of pique but because, The Washington Post reported, worried residents were calling with questions.\n\nTrump\u2019s public response has been to crack down on the perceived insolence of the scientists rather than to ensure that the public got accurate information. Which, if you think about it, might tell us something about how he ran the Trump Organization, too.", "description": "The last week has shown how that effort might work.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0Lo_h7V-ymGonxzu4L9v5DGjAww=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4OY26TGTHQI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
