For A Change'", "language": "en", "text": "Former President Jimmy Carter wants President Donald Trump to step aside and allow the House impeachment investigation to continue.\n\n\u201cMy advice to him would be to tell the truth, I think, for a change,\u201d Carter, 95, suggested in an interview Tuesday on MSNBC.\n\n\u201cAnd also to cut back on his Twitter feeds and give the House of Representatives and also the Senate and, I would say, the general public the evidence that \u2014 that we need to form a case, either for or against him,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the White House refused to cooperate with House Democrats in their impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\nOfficials in the Trump administration would not comply with lawmakers\u2019 requests for documents and interviews involving Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he repeatedly asked him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential rivals.\n\nCarter described Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the investigation \u201ca departure from custom, and a departure from what American people expect.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s one of the main things that Americans are now considering, is the fact that the White House is trying to stonewall and not provide adequate information,\u201d he told MSNBC.\n\nIn the past, Carter has expressed both approval and criticism for Trump and his administration. In June, Carter suggested that Trump was an illegitimate president who actually \u201clost the election and was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.\u201d\n\nHowever, in March 2018, well before Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky was made public, Carter said he\u2019d prefer if Trump wasn\u2019t impeached over the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election campaign.\n\nCarter spoke with MSNBC from Nashville, days after he fell at home and sustained an injury that required stitches on his forehead.", "description": "The former president wants the impeachment inquiry to carry on, and he criticized the Trump administration's refusal to comply with the House investigation.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d224720000069054fb546.jpeg?cache=dbfps4hyvq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
