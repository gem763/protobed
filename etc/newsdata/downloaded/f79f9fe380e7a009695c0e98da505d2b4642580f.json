Another 19% said they were \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to participate.\n\nSee: Why millennials prefer cannabis to booze: \u2018Zero enjoyment out of drinking\u2019\n\nLast year, a quarter of respondents said they participated. Four percent said they had \u201cpartial participation.\u201d\n\nWhile UBS acknowledges that respondents\u2019 claims of past participation don\u2019t necessarily predict behavior this month, \u201cthe sober-curious movement appears to be gaining steam among U.S. drinkers and could impact beverage alcohol demand.\u201d\n\nDemographically, those who say they will participate skew male, which analysts found surprising. Less so was the fact that many with intent to participate are younger and in the Northeast or on the West Coast.\n\n\u201cIn the context of categories, we believe that the age and regional exposures present a modest risk to the explosive growth trajectory of hard seltzer, given the category\u2019s younger skew and relative strength on the coasts,\u201d UBS analysts led by Sean King wrote.\n\nTruly, a hot hard seltzer that launched in May 2016, is a Boston Beer Co. SAM, -5.22% brand. Other brands in the company\u2019s portfolio are Sam Adams beer, Twisted Tea, spiked iced tea, and Angry Orchard, a brand of hard cider.\n\nMarketWatch reached out to Boston Beer for comment but didn\u2019t get a response by press time.\n\nAlso: Juul claimed its e-cigs are \u2018totally safe,\u2019 but the case against vaping keeps building\n\nBoston Beer stock is down 3.7% in Tuesday trading, but up nearly 60% for the year to date. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.03% has rallied 18% for 2019 so far.\n\n\u201cWhile it is difficult to predict the impact on a category growing at healthy triple digits, we see incremental risk for Boston Beer given its +30% sales exposure to hard seltzer and the company\u2019s legacy Northeast regional stronghold,\u201d the UBS report said.\n\nBoston Beer was downgraded to underperform from hold at Jefferies last week, not based on Sober September, but rather on greater competition in the spiked seltzer category, which analysts forecast will grow to $3 billion to $4.5 billion over the next two to five years.\n\n\u201c[L]ow brand loyalty, coupled with a wave of new entrants, suggests an increasingly competitive landscape,\u201d Jefferies said.\n\nThe note puts brand loyalty at about 36%, with the willingness to try new brands at about 90%. Natural Light, an Anheuser Busch BUD, -1.65% brand, has launched its version of a hard seltzer along with Pabst Blue Ribbon and many other brands.\n\nJefferies also cut its price target to $332 from $360.\n\nThe Distilled Spirits Council, which represents marketers and producers of beverages like rum, tequila and bourbon, say that consumers are drinking higher-end beverages, not necessarily more of them.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: A beer-sake hybrid will have you rethinking the Japanese rice wine\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s April Alcohol Awareness Month or Sober September, we have always encouraged adult consumers who choose to drink to take some time to reflect on their alcohol consumption to ensure that they are staying within moderate drinking guidelines,\u201d the group said in a statement sent to MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cAlcohol can be enjoyed as part of a balanced adult lifestyle, but responsible drinking and moderation are essential.\u201d", "description": "A UBS survey shows that many members of the key demographics for hard seltzer consumption intend to take a month off for Sober September", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR016_hard_s_ZG_20190910120930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
