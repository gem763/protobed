assuming the 19 Labour backbenchers continue to back his agreement.\n\nHaving cleared its second reading the WAB would still need to pass three more Commons stages to progress to the House of Lords for further scrutiny.\n\nTonight's rebellion comes just days after half a dozen MPs deserted Mr Corbyn in a crunch No Deal vote on Saturday.\n\nA rebel amendment put forward by Sir Oliver Letwin at the weekend which forced Mr Johnson to ask the EU for a Brexit delay against his wishes was agreed by 322 votes to 306, a majority of 16.\n\nLabour supported the move but six of the party's MPs decided to defy Mr Corbyn and vote with the government in a failed attempt to stop Mr Johnson's Brexit plans being scuppered.\n\nPM recorded a historic victory by 329 to 299 as MPs gave his Withdrawal Agreement Bill a second reading, but MPs then thwarted the PM's efforts to rush the laws through Commons in just 72 hours by 322 to 308 (pictured: Mr Johnson folds his arms during tonight's debate)\n\nAfter that vote attention immediately turned to whether the rebels would be punished.\n\nBut they just received a slap on the wrist from party whips and nothing more.\n\nMr Corbyn had suggested last week that Labour MPs who backed the government on Brexit would not be expelled from the party.\n\nHe said at the time that he believed 'in the power of persuasion rather than the power of threat'.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons today, the Labour leader said of the PM's deal: 'Page after page of what amounts to nothing less than a charter for deregulation and a race to the bottom.\n\n'A deal and a Bill that fails to protect our rights and our natural world, fails to protect jobs and the economy, fails to protect every region and nation in the United Kingdom.'", "description": "Labour was rocked by fresh Brexit chaos this evening as 19 of Jeremy Corbyn's MPs defied their leader and sided with the government over the UK's departure from the EU.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/18/20047778-0-image-a-25_1571766842567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
