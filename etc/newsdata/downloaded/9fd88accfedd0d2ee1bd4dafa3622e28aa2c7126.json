While watching Hustlers, I knew what it was doing. There\u2019s no question the movie sides with the strippers who drug and rob all those terrible white, Wall Street guys. Worse still, the movie is based on a true story and even in real life the criminals got off with a slap on the wrist.\n\nBut if you read my review, I don\u2019t mention any of that because \u2026 So what?\n\nMovies that side with criminals are as old as movies.\n\nOver 80 years ago, a studio called Warner Bros. entered the big leagues with countless gangster stories starring James Cagney, George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, Paul Muni, and the Dead End Kids as sympathetic criminals.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Hustlers wasn\u2019t even the first movie this summer to filter sympathy for criminality through a feminist lens. There was also The Kitchen.\n\nBut because everything is stupid in the Age of Trump, you have a bunch of \u201cfilm writers\u201d who know nothing about pre-1999 film, pretending director Todd Phillips\u2019 smash-hit Joker is something new and terribly dangerous \u2014 as though Petrified Forest (1936), White Heat (1949), Clockwork Orange (1971), Taxi Driver (1976), Goodfellas (1990), Natural Born Killers (1994), Casino (1995), and Fight Club (1999), haven\u2019t already mined the idea of siding with crazed, nihilistic psychos.\n\nTaxi Driver ends with our psycho becoming a hero.\n\nClockwork Orange ends with us sympathizing totally with a spree killer and rapist.\n\nJoker doesn\u2019t even go that far. Something everyone is missing, especially these elite, know-nothing critics, is that fact that Joker is really a horror movie, and one no different than Psycho (1960) or Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986). And like those classics, Joker deliberately asks us to sympathize with its sad sack protagonist before ripping the rug out from under us by revealing just how monstrous our \u201chero\u201d really is.\n\nThat is not an immoral approach to a movie. Rather, what could be more moral than shaming the audience for daring to empathize with such a person?\n\nSo not only is this neo-Moral Majority Tipper Gorey moral panic over Joker wrong on the facts, the hypocrisy is breathtaking.\n\nIf you want to get all worked up over a hit movie that actually does side with criminals and criminality, that actually does present the victims as having it coming, there is no question Hustlers applauds and endorses \u201cwomen of color\u201d poisoning rich, white men with drugs before maxing out their credit cards and expense accounts.\n\nThere is also no question The Kitchen sides with vicious mobsters who steal, murder, and muscle innocent people for protection money because the mobsters have vaginas.\n\nEven so, condemning Hustlers as \u201cproblematic\u201d is just as wrongheaded as attacking Joker, just as silly, shallow, and censorious.\n\nIf you want to intelligently judge a movie, you have to look at what the movie is really about, what it\u2019s moral is. Hustlers is not about how cool it is to drug and rob white guys. What it\u2019s really about is how greed, betrayal, and drugs unravel everything \u2014 and that is a moral story to tell.\n\nClockwork Orange is not about how cool it is to kill and rape. What it\u2019s really about is defending human free will \u2014 and that is a moral story to tell.\n\nJoker isn\u2019t about how a white man filled with repressed rage can change the world with a gun. What it\u2019s really (here\u2019s my review) about are the terrible consequences of a government that controls everything (from garbage pick up to your health care), a growing lack of empathy in our culture, the sick allure of celebrity, and how mindless Americans will follow anyone, even a psychopath, if it allows them to blame their own shortcomings on someone else \u2014 and that is a moral story to tell.\n\n***SPOILERS***\n\nThis moron at CNN who declared Joker \u201can insidious validation of the white-male resentment that helped bring President Donald Trump to power\u201d might win the award for the most shallow hot take ever.\n\nYou have to ask yourself how simple a man has to be when that\u2019s his only takeaway from a movie where a psychopath kills an innocent mother and child (off screen), kills the man who makes his dream of being on TV come true; where a small child helplessly watches his parents, even his poor mother, gunned down by Joker\u2019s Antifa-style minions \u2014 this is not even a mugging gone sideways, it\u2019s a cold-blooded hate crime and murder.\n\n***END SPOILERS***\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting exercise: Go back and read the CNN moron\u2019s piece, or any of these other moronic anti-Joker hot takes, and replace \u201cwhite guys\u201d with \u201cwomen of color,\u201d replace \u201cJoker\u201d with \u201cHustlers.\u201d If you do that, these whiners and scolds almost make sense. They\u2019re still puddle deep and moronic, but at least there\u2019s some ground available to stand on.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
