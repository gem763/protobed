But joint developments do add a lot of complexity.\n\nOne option you might consider, which Butler reckons is the simplest solution for any proposed joint venture, is for the SMSF to sell its property to the unit trust at market value. While this might not be proceeded with given the costs in terms of capital gains tax and stamp duty, it should at least be investigated.\n\nIf the SMSF trustees don't wish to sell the property, separate development may be the next best option.\n\nWhat to consider\n\nBased on a rough understanding of your circumstances, Butler identified several issues you will need to consider if your SMSF wishes to proceed with a joint venture partnership development.\n\nIf you engage a builder or project manager to carry out any activities, you will need to ensure everything they do happens on an arm\u2019s length basis for each development, with appropriate evidence supporting any terms and considerations. Arm's length also means any transactions must be carried out on the same commercial terms and conditions as they would be with someone who is not related to the fund or its members.\n\nInvariably with any parties to a joint venture, debit and credit balances can arise during the course of a development where each should be putting in proportionate funding and resources. A risk that needs to be constantly monitored is where these might get out of kilter and contravene of super rules.\n\nWhere an SMSF trustee or director-member or someone related to them provides services to a project, careful consideration needs to be given as to whether they should or should not be remunerated and by how much to maintain compliance with superannuation rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButler says a complex issue when it comes to any SMSF property development is the non-arm\u2019s-length income rules that apply to DIY fund trustees. These rules were recently clarified in a draft law companion ruling from the tax office (LCR 2019/D3).\n\nPayment rules\n\nThis broadly states that if an SMSF trustee/director provides a property development service to a fund, the entity is not able to be paid for this unless it is a registered builder carrying on a business of providing building duties to the public. It is very important that trustees are aware that any asset created by a service that is not remunerated when it should be under the super regulations will be treated as generating non-arm\u2019s-length income and liable to tax of 45 per cent.\n\nThe draft ruling provides examples where an asset within an SMSF incurs an expense that is not charged at market rates, which would then see any income generated by that asset treated as non-arm\u2019s-length income. Further, any net capital gain after the usual one-third CGT discount could also be fully liable for 45 per cent tax instead of the usual concessional super tax rate of 15 per cent (or nil if in pension/retirement phase subject to the transfer balance cap limit).\n\nButler says anyone wishing to involve their SMSF in property development needs serious advance planning. There are plenty of issues to work through and consider before an SMSF starts any property development.\n\nImportant for anyone is the planning stage where time should be spent creating a short- and long-term strategic property development plan. This should involve contacting your surveyor, any builders, engineers and town planner to get the ball rolling on planning and building permit approvals.\n\nThe superannuation legal and tax structure needs to be resolved early so that any transaction costs are minimised. This can be a lengthy process, says Butler, but is necessary to ensure any involvement by your SMSF will not contravene any super or tax rules.\n\nThe SMSF deed, investment strategy and other legal documents should also be reviewed and revised. Most importantly, the SMSF trustee should be a corporate trustee, and an appropriate insurance and legal review of relevant documentation and contracts should be undertaken to ensure the SMSF is protected.\n\nEmail journalist John Wasiliev with your questions at superquestions@afr.com.", "description": "The rules are complex so early planning is vital, writes John Wasiliev who answers your questions on super.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2119%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_98/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a256fe23f08d3274ca7cb101d6aaaf3d73db44d5", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
