The Kurds have spearheaded the on-the-ground fight against ISIS in northern Syria and have been repaid for their efforts by Trump clearing the way for Turkey to obliterate them.\n\nSome of the angriest criticism yet has come from the unlikely source of Fox & Friends. A visibly furious Kilmeade argued with his co-hosts, called Trump\u2019s decision \u201cdisastrous,\u201d and questioned why any ally of the U.S. would now place any level of trust in the Trump administration.\n\nKilmeade said: \u201cWe defeated the caliphate, the caliphate is destroyed, we wouldn't have done that without the Kurds who did all of our fighting... The reason why our casualties were so low is because the Kurds did all the fighting. Now we\u2019re saying, \u2018OK Turks, go wipe them out or force them out.\u2019 What kind of message is that to the next ally who wants to side with us?\u201d\n\nKilmeade said the decision was \u201ca disastrous series of events\u201d and urged Trump to reconsider the call. It\u2019s not clear if Trump was watching the show but he was simultaneously defending his decision on Twitter.\n\nCo-host Steve Doocy attempted to defend the president from Kilmeade\u2019s attack, saying that it was a \u201ccampaign promise\u201d to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria\u2014but that just made Kilmeade more angry. He responded: \u201cTo release ISIS fighters and abandon our allies? That\u2019s a campaign promise? Abandon the people that got the caliphate destroyed?\u201d\n\nKilmeade, shaking his head, went on: \u201cAre you kidding me? We\u2019re abandoning our most loyal allies who did all our fighting. All we did was arm them and they did all the work and now we say \u2018Good luck, good luck surviving.\u2019 Disaster.\u201d\n\nLater in the show, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared and strongly agreed with Kilmeade\u2019s analysis. He called Trump\u2019s decision a \u201cbig win\u201d for Iran, ISIS, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He also wrote on Twitter that the decision was a \u201cdisaster\u201d that will ensure an ISIS comeback and \u201cbe a stain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds.\u201d Graham also said he will introduce a Senate resolution to reverse Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nThe president expressed no remorse over his decision Monday morning, posting on Twitter that it\u2019s not America\u2019s problem. \u201cThe Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\u201d", "description": "Brian Kilmeade was visibly furious the morning after the White House announced it would leave the Kurds to fend for themselves.", "authors": ["Jamie Ross"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_779,w_1386,x_22,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570450503/Screen_Shot_2019-10-07_at_13.13.11_oyqgup", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
