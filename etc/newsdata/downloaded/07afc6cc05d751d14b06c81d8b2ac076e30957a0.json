Shalala Touts H.R. 3 in Democratic Weekly Address", "language": "en", "text": "During Friday\u2019s Democratic Weekly Address, Representative Donna Shalala (D-FL) touted H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.\n\nTranscript as Follows:\n\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Donna Shalala.\n\nI represent Florida\u2019s 27th Congressional District.\n\nOnly a few times in our history has Congress come together to pass legislation to dramatically improve the lives of the American people: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Plan, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Medicare\u2019s drug benefit and, of course, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe changed lives. We saved lives.\n\nNow, we continue to work For The People with H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.\n\nWe are working to pass this bill into law so it can join these momentous commitments.\n\nWe pay more for our prescription drugs than any other country on Earth.\n\nWe have made incredible advances in medical science and developed cures not only for our own people, but also for the rest of the world.\n\nAnd yet, even when our own researchers and scientists have dedicated their lives to creating lifesaving drugs, too many of our fellow Americans can\u2019t afford to benefit from their brilliance.\n\nIn the United States today, a disease or chronic condition can force you into bankruptcy, or require you to choose between paying for medicine and paying for food or rent.\n\nH.R. 3 makes reforms to reduce drug prices, to keep cost hikes to no more than inflation and to limit out-of-pocket costs for those on Medicare, on employer plans and private health insurance.\n\nTo help secure these patient protections, we will require our government to negotiate prices directly with drug companies.\n\nI served as Secretary of Health and Human Services for eight years in the Clinton Administration. I repeatedly asked for the ability to negotiate with drug companies.\n\nOnly drug companies get to come to Medicare and set their own prices. Hospitals don\u2019t get to do that; doctors don\u2019t get to do that; home health care agencies don\u2019t get to do that; medical equipment providers don\u2019t get to do that.\n\nNegotiation is a hallmark of good governance and a standard feature of government policy. We negotiate for everything, including military equipment and work with contractors.\n\nIt is only drug companies that are able to write themselves a blank check from taxpayers. Our legislation ends that practice.\n\nNow is the time for us to join every other country on Earth in allowing our government to bargain for better prices and to put a cap on our out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAs citizens, we have always been willing to subsidize poorer countries. But subsidizing England, and France, and Canada, and Germany, and Australia, and Japan, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is not our responsibility.\n\nWe are not their deep pockets. We should not pay substantially more for the same medicines than people in those countries.\n\nThe current, broken system is costing our families and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars. We must not accept this waste or this unfairness any longer.\n\nOur bill is a solid plan to reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for every American, and it will create huge savings for taxpayers.\n\nThese savings will allow us to make significant investments in the extraordinary biomedical science institutions that foster innovation, such as the National Institutes of Health and, of course, our great research universities.\n\nThis bill will expand our capacity for innovation and make drug companies more efficient. H.R. 3 is a historic step forward to make all of our lives better.\n\nThank you, and God bless America.\u201d", "description": "During Friday's Democratic Weekly Address, Representative Donna Shalala (D-FL) touted H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
