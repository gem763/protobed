Thus most Conservative MPs will be required to stay in London, in case the opposition mounts an ambush in the House of Commons, while only the chief panjandrums will travel to Manchester to address the nervous activists.\n\nYet the proceedings in Manchester will still be important, even if they do nothing to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, which is the conference slogan. Because there is politics beyond Brexit; there are things the government can do, even without a majority in parliament; and there will, soon enough, be a general election.\n\nSo it is worth noting that Boris Johnson has shifted the Conservative Party\u2019s policy on issues other than Brexit. Theresa May announced the end of austerity, and set out ambitious spending plans for the health service. But Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has now set out plans for a substantial increase in non-NHS public spending for next year, including higher funding for schools, police and social care.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMr Javid\u2019s spending review was almost forgotten in all the parliamentary excitement at the start of this month, as opposition MPs took control of parliament to pass a law against a no-deal Brexit. But it has shifted the centre of gravity of British politics.\n\nMr Johnson insists he is a liberal, One Nation Conservative. If he can ever gain a hearing above the cacophony of Brexit \u2013 much of the noise coming from him and his stirrer-up-in-chief, Dominic Cummings \u2013 it would be worth pitting his case against the emboldened statist instincts of the Labour Party.\n\nAt its conference this week, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s supporters pushed a long way beyond the mild social-democratic programme presented at the 2017 election. The party\u2019s spending plans \u2013 extravagant in 2017 \u2013 have ballooned since then. Many of the objects are worthy, but they cannot all be affordable.\n\nLabour\u2019s unpopularity is concealed by the fragmentation of a two-party system into a four, five or six-party system, but Mr Corbyn seems to be going further away from the voters rather than towards them. The idea of a 32-hour working week, for example, might be taken as evidence of unrealistic utopianism, while the pledge to \u201cabolish\u201d private schools risks being seen as illiberal.\n\nOne thing that all three leading UK parties, and the Scottish National Party, are taking more seriously than ever this conference season is the environment.\n\nThe Conservatives have the advantage of being in government \u2013 at least notionally \u2013 and so ought to be able talk with more authority about realistic policies to deliver better public services and to minimise the UK\u2019s contribution to climate change.\n\nIn the next few days in Manchester they have the chance to show \u2013 beneath the bluff and bluster about Brexit \u2013 whether they have the seriousness of purpose to do so.", "description": "It is symbolic that the party of government could not muster the votes in parliament to adjourn proceedings for the three days of its annual conference.
