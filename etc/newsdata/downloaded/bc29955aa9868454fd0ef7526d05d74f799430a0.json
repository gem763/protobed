Photo: Dustin Chambers/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s a quiet but disquietingly hot and soupy Saturday afternoon at an outdoor caf\u00e9 table in a Charlottesville shopping center, and Beto O\u2019Rourke is staring off to my right, thinking hard about how to respond after I asked him a classic presidential campaign gotcha question: how his day\u2019s been going. \u201cIt\u2019s been, uh, it\u2019s been a good day,\u201d he immediately offers, and then falls silent, starting to expand on his answer, and then stopping, several times.\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s not easy to describe anything about O\u2019Rourke these days, whether you\u2019re him or a voter or a reporter, or one of his 19 remaining 2020 rivals, and maybe it shouldn\u2019t be. We were originally supposed to meet during a routine early August political swing through California, where I was going to ask him, among other things, about his tactics for getting his campaign back on track after its steady drop in polling. After all, he\u2019s now down below not just Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but to the level of Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 the result of a campaign that sometimes felt like a lukewarm imitation of his 2018 race, that left some Texans asking him to return home to run for the Senate again, and that left others simply puzzled by his lack of a clear message or stated reason for running.\n\nThat plan went out the window two days before our scheduled interview, when a gunman killed 22 people and injured 24 more, targeting Latinos, in the former congressman\u2019s hometown of El Paso. O\u2019Rourke, 46, left the trail for a while, then returned with a speech there, promising a new kind of uncompromising campaign that more directly, and assertively, and urgently, addressed the danger of Donald Trump and the hate he stirs up around the country, because if \u201cwe do not wake up to this threat, then we as a country will die in our sleep.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been a whole new Beto since then. In this new incarnation, he has ditched his (disorienting) carousel of policy emphases that saw him alternately go all-in on immigration, climate, and gun policy. Instead, he\u2019s focused his policy talk on individual calls for aggressive action like mandatory assault-weapon buybacks. He hasn\u2019t stopped visiting the usual campaign stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, but he\u2019s cut back, and he\u2019s now spending way more time in hard-hit communities or places where he can make a clear political point, like the Mississippi town devastated by ICE raids, the site of the old \u201cBlack Wall Street\u201d in Tulsa, and a gun show in Little Rock. The day before we met, over Labor Day weekend, he swung through a Virginia county where Trump won 82 percent of the vote in 2016. (A local TV station reported he was the first presidential candidate ever to visit Bland, population 6,293.) And he\u2019s not talking much about himself these days. Instead, he\u2019s talking a lot about structural inequality and discrimination, and about racism, and \u2014 more than anything else \u2014 about urgency.\n\nHe now comes across as if he\u2019s both grappling with his fallen standing in the race and insistent that the task ahead is too urgent for any kind of indulgent introspection. He\u2019s been thinking a lot about what this new campaign really means, though, and now, after 15 very slow seconds, he asks whether I\u2019d been present for his public programming earlier in the day. This morning and early afternoon he sat for a roundtable largely composed of black activists to talk about local inequities and the 2017 white supremacist demonstrations here, then visited privately with Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, who was killed that day. Conversations like the ones he was having today, he suggests, underscore the point he\u2019s trying to make now. Which is: \u201cEverything\u2019s on the line. Everything that we care about\u2019s gonna be decided.\u201d And: \u201cWe\u2019re waking up, and we\u2019re gonna take action.\u201d And: \u201cWe still have a chance to save the country.\u201d\n\nSo, that said, how to explain the new Beto\u2019s look as distinct from the wandering pre-campaign Beto and the slowly deflating version of himself that has been manifest in recent months? For one, he seems to have no interest in going after his Democratic opponents like he once, briefly, did. He passes when I give him a chance to ding Biden for not yet visiting Charlottesville, even though the former VP brings it up constantly, pivoting instead to talking about decades-old policies that pushed black residents out of town. And he\u2019s not worried, he says, about whether or not his rivals get it like he says he now does. (\u201cI think everyone is doing their best, and is motivated to run in some part because they understand how urgent this moment is.\u201d) But, he says of Trump, \u201cAs challenging as some of these underlying problems are \u2014 and have been, in many cases, since the beginning of our country \u2014 his attack on every institution that could possibly save us, from the ballot box; to an independent judiciary; to the press, whom he refers to as the \u2018enemy of the people\u2019; to his invitation to invasion from foreign powers; to the thing I think is most dangerous \u2014 and obviously, we saw this manifest in El Paso \u2014 the giving up of any pretense toward, you know, a more perfect union, or the fulfillment of the words at the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, that we\u2019re all created equal. Just saying, \u2018No, actually you Muslims are dangerous, you Mexicans are criminals, you African-Americans should go back to your country\u2019 \u2014 that fundamentally undermines, and potentially ends, any possibility of still reaching something that I think is within our grasp, which is the ability to fulfill that promise that we made to ourselves 243 years ago. And then you lose this, you lose this forever.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: He still doesn\u2019t actually talk all that much about Trump on the trail, or at least not as much as you might think if you just read the coverage about his campaign reboot. Today, before we speak, he barely mentions the president at all until prompted by a reporter after the roundtable. So O\u2019Rourke\u2019s still working on his new messaging \u2014 on making explicit the connection between Trump and the civic rot he\u2019s talking about. The main problem he\u2019d been having connecting to voters in the first place, he suggests, is not making this connection clear enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to do a better job, that\u2019s one of the things I was trying to say in that speech, in El Paso. Insofar as I have failed to meet this threat with the urgency it requires, I\u2019ve been part of the problem,\u201d he says, at this point one bite into the chocolate croissant his aide brought him (he\u2019ll only take one bite), and still looking off to my right, near where he\u2019s parked the big red Dodge minivan he\u2019s been driving around town. \u201cThe connections are very clear to me, in the things the president has done, and has said, and the actions that have followed. To call out the urgency of the threat, but also to acknowledge that the underlying causes have long been, or always been, with us [is the goal]. We need to be able to address both, but one is more imminent than the other, and that is Donald Trump.\u201d So is this all that wasn\u2019t working for him before? Or would he do something else differently if he could go back to, say, December, when he was publicly waffling about a run? \u201cI think, um, more clearly calling out the connections. Which,\u201d he quickly adds, \u201cif you were to ask me four months ago, I\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m doing that,\u2019\u201d pointing out that he condemned Trump\u2019s Islamophobia the day of the Christchurch, New Zealand mosque shootings in March.\n\nYet, he continues, \u201cI also think that there is so much ritual and performance that\u2019s unconnected to this threat that we all willingly \u2014 myself included \u2014 participate in, as part of what we think is the necessary path to win the nomination, or to become president of the United States. So much of this is not connected to peoples\u2019 day-to-day lives, or the urgency of the threat they see.\u201d He brings up an article he recently read about a worker on the effort against David Duke\u2019s 1990 Senate campaign. \u201cPeople were saying, \u2018Talk about the economy, talk about kitchen-table issues. The polling suggests that we should do this,\u2019 or, \u2018The consultant advises that we do the other.\u2019 And he was like, \u2018Fuck it. If we don\u2019t talk about the racism, then people can be forgiven for saying, Well, look, if the Democrat is not talking about this, and it\u2019s pretty clear, maybe I have it wrong. Maybe that\u2019s not who he is, and what he\u2019s doing.\u2019 I think about that, in terms of Trump.\u201d And a big part of making that case, he says, is going to places like Charlottesville, or Bland, or Tulsa, which he wishes \u2014 he says, when I straight-up ask him to diagnose what had been going wrong for him \u2014 he was doing far more of before.\n\n\u201cPeople in Iowa,\u201d he explains, \u201cin addition to wanting to see you in Iowa \u2014 and we\u2019ve been there a lot \u2014 they are also interested in how the rest of the country is doing.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s the newest Beto, talking about a lot of the same stuff he was trying to bring up earlier, but, he hopes, more effectively, and more, well, urgently. Some of his old ways are gone, like his talking points about getting work done with Republicans. (\u201cI was blinded by a faith in bipartisanship,\u201d he says, which has now dissipated, especially in the wake of the shooting and the lack of subsequent congressional action on guns.) He won\u2019t even admit to any emotion about the upcoming departure from Congress of his friend Will Hurd, a border Republican who\u2019s disagreed with Trump. Last year, O\u2019Rourke praised him and refused to endorse his Democratic opponent. Now, O\u2019Rourke thanks Hurd for his service, but says he\u2019s \u201creally glad\u201d a Democrat, Gina Ortiz Jones, will almost certainly replace him.\n\nThe central political bet of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s new tack, and attitude, is that his brand of plainly spoken callouts of Trump and the president\u2019s relationship with the nation\u2019s biggest problems is what the people want \u2014 need \u2014 to hear now. He\u2019s not trying to redefine himself ideologically, or to be more like Warren or Sanders or Biden, or whomever. He\u2019s still wearing his signature blue shirt, speaking in the classic Beto staccato you surely remember from the skateboarding, viral-video days. And he\u2019s still a political celebrity \u2014 we\u2019re interrupted three times by a total of eight starstruck people over the course of our conversation, though the first was a woman from El Paso who said she was his old doctor\u2019s daughter. Once we finish, it takes him a good ten minutes to wade through the well-wishers and back to his car, and over our time together, I catch multiple double-takes from passersby clearly delighted by spotting Beto in the wilderness.\n\nBut there\u2019s a new kind of weighted restlessness here too, bordering on exasperation. We\u2019re speaking just before news breaks of the shooting in Odessa and Midland, and his campaign soon after starts selling \u201cTHIS IS F*CKED UP\u201d T-shirts, with proceeds going to two gun-control groups. (He\u2019s started cursing a lot more these days, too. Presumably people consumed by urgency aren\u2019t worried about niceties of decorum?)\n\nAt the table, with the shadows retreating as the afternoon matures, he seems hung up on an effective metaphor he heard from a local earlier in the day: that, from the outside, everything in town looked fine to white people a couple years ago, and everyone kept polishing the fishbowl\u2019s glass, until the white supremacists showed up and exposed the muck under rocks at the bottom of the bowl, which had been there all along, and which Charlottesville\u2019s black residents knew all about. And O\u2019Rourke seems to have lost patience with anyone who doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about what\u2019s changed for him since the El Paso shooting, and he thinks back to the outcry when he first labeled the president a white supremacist. \u201cI mean, just the catalogue of things that he\u2019s said, it doesn\u2019t have to be Beto O\u2019Rourke calling him a white supremacist, it\u2019s really Donald Trump calling himself that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can die in our sleep if we\u2019re unwilling to ring that alarm, to call it out clearly. That\u2019s how you lose all of this. And, you really wonder, you know, how did that happen in other countries? People who were dismissed as clowns, [whose voters said], \u2018I didn\u2019t vote for him for the anti-Semitism and racism, I voted for the economy and the capital gains.\u2019 You look at Italy, you look at Germany in the 1920s and 1930s.\u201d\n\nOkay, now he\u2019s talking about Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of an example of another country whose leader would describe one people, one religion, as inherently defective, or dangerous, or it being necessary to keep them out of the country. And how the fuck doesn\u2019t that get called out?\u201d It\u2019s impeachable, he says. \u201cHow do you explain the lack of urgency? It is, in some ways, so bizarre, and so counter to how we think about ourselves and this country \u2014 so almost impossible for us to conceive of \u2014 and it happens at such a blindingly fast pace, and his behavior is so bizarre, and he is so masterful at talking about Greenland just as you\u2019re about to focus on the challenge at hand, that we\u2019re unable to just clearly see it, or honestly talk about it, or act on it decisively.\u201d\n\nThe question O\u2019Rourke now faces is whether he\u2019s talking about all these things distinctively enough from his rivals to force people to pay attention again. His first two outings on the debate stage didn\u2019t go too well: First, in June, he was skewered on immigration by Juli\u00e1n Castro, and then, in July, he faded into the background. So how, in September, is he going to stand up and insist, \u201cThis stuff is important\u201d? In other words, can he find an effective way to credibly convince the country of his new approach within the race\u2019s established parameters?\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you can train for that, or practice for that, or rehearse for that. And, you know, that\u2019s certainly what \u2014 in the first debate \u2014 I was trying to do. I was like, \u2018Alright, if I\u2019m asked this, I will say that.\u2019 You know, \u2018It\u2019s important that every answer be structured in the following way.\u2019 It is almost paralyzing, and what is so much more powerful \u2014 and perhaps liberating \u2014 is: Just say what\u2019s on your mind, regardless of whether you hit all the necessary points.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, is basically what he\u2019s been saying about the rest of the race, not just the debate stage. He prefers campaigning by knocking on doors, because of the spontaneity, he says. Which, I point out, is \u201cthe opposite of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is the opposite of a debate! The debate is the furthest afield from that!\u201d He seems buoyed by this gloomy fact. \u201cPeople have their rehearsed attack lines, or their, you know, zingers. Or the thing they want to meme, or trend on Twitter. Um, and I suck at that!\u201d\n\nWhich, inevitably, leads us back to the wager that O\u2019Rourke is now making. That if he can just be himself \u2014 just more \u2014 that he might still have a path to the White House.\n\n\u201cSo how can I connect with you through the airwaves, back where you\u2019re watching the debate, in a way that feels like I\u2019m at your door? I don\u2019t know if I can do that \u2014 that\u2019s a really tall order. But that\u2019s what I want to do! And so,\u201d he says, plowing forward, \u201cI think approaching it the same way I approach knocking on a door is gonna be my take on this one. And, for good or for bad, that will be my way.\u201d", "description": "The Texas Democrat has had trouble connecting with voters.
