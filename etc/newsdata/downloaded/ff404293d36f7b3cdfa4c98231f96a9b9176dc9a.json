I asked you if you f**k with Donald Trump, you said you don\u2019t know,\u201d the Los Angeles rapper could be heard saying. \u201cSo, since you don't know, I need you to make up your mind tonight.\u201d\n\nYG invites fan on stage to yell out \"F**k Donald Trump,\" kicks him off after he refuses pic.twitter.com/7z9r9gVXav \u2014 XXL Magazine (@XXL) October 27, 2019\n\nYG then asked the fan to state his name and shout obscenities about Trump. The young man shook his head.\n\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t?\u2026 Get him off the stage\u2026 He a Donald Trump supporter. Get his ass outta here,\u201d the rapper said as the crowd cheered.\n\nThe stunt did not sit well with social media users, who said YG\u2019s behavior was completely uncalled for.\n\nNot a Trump supporter but this was unnecessary. pic.twitter.com/6rtumrkIyf \u2014 Claymore K (@ClaymoreKwaram1) October 27, 2019\n\nImagine thinking having a different opinion is a viable reason to kick someone out of a concert they payed money for. \u2014 \ud83d\udc9c Jay Bha \ud83d\udc9c (@jaybhaa) October 27, 2019\n\nOthers applauded the unnamed fan for not bowing to public pressure.\n\nWhat a move by this young man! At a moment in front of thousands, on stage with someone so famous. He stays true to himself and his beliefs! He would rather get kicked out and booed than say something he doesn\u2019t believe in. It\u2019s not the content that matters, it\u2019s the principle! \u2014 Thinking Movement Podcast (@ThinkinMovement) October 28, 2019\n\nIt's not about who he supports it's about him not letting someone pressure him into saying some shit he didn't feel.\n\n\n\nHe didnt fold and I respect that! pic.twitter.com/FezFeajOBZ \u2014 C I V W A Y (@LEWCIV) October 28, 2019\n\nTwitter users also noted that, regardless of what the fan said, the video would spread across the internet \u2013 and that his best course of action was to simply refuse, without stating his actual political beliefs.\n\nLike this story?
