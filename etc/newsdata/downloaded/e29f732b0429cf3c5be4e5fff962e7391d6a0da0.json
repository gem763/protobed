Instead, websites must ask users to actively opt in to sharing their data.\n\nThe ruling from the Luxembourg-based court dealt a blow to search engines, social media platforms and other websites that rely heavily on such boxes to obtain consent with minimal input from people across the 28-country bloc.\n\nThe ruling, which will apply across the European Union, originated in Germany where a group of consumer organizations filed a lawsuit against Planet 49, a local website that hosted an online lottery.\n\nBy prompting users to make a proactive choice, the ruling may lead people to deny consent and potentially deprive websites of personal data that is now the lifeblood of the digital economy.\n\nThe ruling is the latest from Europe\u2019s highest court that aims to rein in tech companies\u2019 activities. On Thursday, the same judges will rule if Facebook should be held responsible for removing defamatory content from its global platform or merely from the country where the complaint was filed.\n\nThe ruling also marks a victory for privacy campaigners who have pushed back against the use of so-called \u201ccookies,\u201d or technology that allows firms to collect information on people\u2019s digital activities.\n\nCase born in Germany\n\nThe ruling, which will apply across the European Union, originated in Germany where a group of consumer organizations filed a lawsuit against Planet 49, a local website that hosted an online lottery.\n\nTo participate in the sweepstake, users needed to check two boxes, one of which had been pre-checked to allow the use of cookies. To revoke consent, the user needed to actively uncheck the box.\n\nThat was incompatible with Europe's tough privacy standards, the German consumer advocates argued.\n\nOn Tuesday, the CJEU sided with them, fueling a debate over how much say people should have over how their data is collected, and exactly how consent should be granted.\n\n\u201cThe court decides that the consent which a website user must give to the storage of and access to cookies on his or her equipment is not validly constituted by way of a pre-checked checkbox which that user must deselect to refuse his or her consent,\u201d the judges wrote in a statement.\n\nAs a new European Commission prepares to take office November 1, consumer protection groups and Silicon Valley companies are ramping up lobbying around several planned pieces of legislation \u2014 including the so-called ePrivacy regulation, which aims to set privacy rules for online communications \u2014 that will affect how digital information is collected and managed.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling \u201cspells it out for the industry and calls for clear rules on confidentiality of our communications,\" said Diego Naranjo, Head of Policy at EDRi, a consumer rights group. \u201cEU member states need to finally move forward with legislating this practice, and take the much-needed ePrivacy Regulation out of the EU Council\u2019s closet.\u201d\n\nThe ePrivacy regulation has been stuck in negotiations between national interests at the Council of the European Union.\n\nSeveral lawsuits argue that websites are bypassing new data protection rules, notably by making access to online services such as Google and Facebook conditional on providing consent for data gathering.\n\n\u201cThe ruling is an important sign for the protection of digital privacy,\u201d Heiko D\u00fcnkel, the German consumer organizations\u2019 legal officer, said in a statement. \u201cTracking cookies enable website operators and third-party providers to make a comprehensive evaluation of the surfing and usage behavior of customers.\u201d\n\nA representative for Planet 49 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn its ruling, the Luxembourg-based court also said that selecting a button to participate in a lottery was not sufficient to be considered valid consent. Instead, websites must give users sufficient information on what will be done with their collected data and what steps they can take to limit it.\n\n\u201cThe information that the service provider must give to a user includes the duration of the operation of cookies and whether or not third parties may have access to those cookies,\u201d the judges concluded.\n\nWhile the ruling represented a win for privacy campaigners, it not clear how it will be enforced or whether it will lead to an increase in so-called \u201cpop-ups\u201d prompting users for consent to have their data gathered. Europe\u2019s existing rules \u2014 known as the cookie directive \u2014 were criticized for bombarding users with such pop-ups, which many people agree to without reading the fine print.\n\nTuesday\u2019s judgment \u201cindicates a direction in how the laws are moving,\u201d said Luca Tosoni, a privacy researcher at the University of Oslo.\n\nUnder the EU\u2019s new data protection rules, which came into force in May 2018, companies faced a new obligation to detail what information they were collecting and what other firms would be given access to the information.\n\nBut several lawsuits, including one from Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems, argue that websites are bypassing those obligations, notably by making access to online services such as Google and Facebook conditional on providing consent for data gathering. Both companies deny any wrongdoing.\n\nRulings on Schrems\u2019 complaints are expected to be published next year.\n\nTuesday\u2019s judgment \u201cindicates a direction in how the laws are moving,\u201d said Luca Tosoni, a privacy researcher at the University of Oslo. \u201cThe degree of autonomy that is given to people over how they are able to give their consent is rather big.\u201d", "description": "Laws are moving to rein in tech companies\u2019 activities.", "authors": ["Mark Scott", "Janosch Delcker", "Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-460245922-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
