Republicans have repeatedly requested it be done and Chairman Adam Schiff is refusing to do so.\n\nOne key fact about yesterday\u2019s closed-door witness interview?\n\n\n\nRepublicans are the ones calling for public release of the deposition transcript.\n\n\n\nThat should tell you something. Democrats prefer narratives, not facts.https://t.co/VdKsM9wrcm \u2014 Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) October 4, 2019\n\nThere's a reason why Adam Schiff released cherry-picked text messages and not the transcript of the Volker interview. It's because he's misleading. Again.\n\n\n\nThe actual interview directly undermined Democrats' impeachment effort.\n\n\n\nRelease the transcript. Show Americans the truth. \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) October 4, 2019\n\n.@HouseDemocrats should be ashamed today. By publicly releasing cherry-picked documents, Democrats have polluted the public discourse with misinformation.\n\n\n\nWe hope the American people will get to see the full context of Volker\u2019s testimony. Will @RepAdamSchiff let it happen? https://t.co/noeBCDcgtm \u2014 Oversight Committee Republicans (@GOPoversight) October 4, 2019\n\nAs Julio reported earlier, Volker's full testimony was reportedly a flop, which may explain why Democrats don't want it released.", "description": ".10/04/2019 12:49:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/6a7d2689-a635-48fe-b48b-a7ac97b5f208.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
