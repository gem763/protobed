[PHOTO/CHINA DAILY]\n\nStatement of the Commissioner\u2019s Office on the passage of Hong Kong-related bills at the US House: Playing Hong Kong as a card will get the US nowhere\n\n\n\nSome American politicians have kept bent on passing Hong Kong-related bills including the so-called \"Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019\", ignoring the facts and confounding right with wrong. By doing so, they have openly endorsed anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong, tested the red line of the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle, grossly interfered with Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs as a whole, and trampled upon international law and basic norms governing international relations. We express strong indignation over and condemn such actions, which have again exposed the politicians' gangster logic and hegemonic mindset.\n\nIn the name of \"human rights and democracy\", these politicians have attempted to undermine Hong Kong's role as the international financial, trading and shipping center, intimidated the just forces committed to stopping violence and ending the chaos, and unscrupulously provided shelter for the violent extremists in Hong Kong. It fully proves that it is exactly these politicians who have been orchestrating the chaos behind the scenes, and that some forces in the US have plotted to instigate a \"color revolution\" in Hong Kong and play the city as a card so as to fish in troubled waters and hold back China's development. Such evil intentions have been laid bare.\n\nThese politicians have put themselves in a position to judge and dictate, made unwarranted comments about Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs as a whole, and slung mud at the Central and the SAR governments. We cannot help but ask: what has given them such confidence to point fingers at a region of another country, while the region ranks higher than the US in terms of freedom and rule of law? Also, while showing no mercy in tackling demonstrations in their own country and turning a blind eye to the fact that US police shooting caused a casualty of nearly 1,000 in 2017 alone, these politicians have made groundless accusations against the Hong Kong police who have enforced and defended the law with utmost restraint, and turned a deaf ear to the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong calling for stopping the chaos and violence and safeguarding the rule of law. What else can it be but typical double standard?\n\nSince Hong Kong's return, the practice of \"One Country, Two Systems\" in the SAR has been a universally recognized success, with Hong Kong's status as the international financial, aviation and trading center further strengthened, and the people of Hong enjoying more extensive democratic rights and freedoms than ever. It is a fact that anyone without bias will acknowledge.\n\nHong Kong's success has been the result of the toil and perseverance of its people with the strong support of China's mainland and in the Lion Rock spirit. It has never been and will never be a gift granted by foreign countries. Any attempt by foreign forces to split China is pipe dream. The 1.4 billion Chinese people, including our 7.5 million Hong Kong compatriots, will never be cowered or subdued by any foreign coercion or pressure.\n\nWe urge the relevant American politicians to grasp the trend of the times, immediately stop advancing the bills, and refrain from meddling with Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs as a whole. Let us repeat our message to the politicians: you will get nowhere by playing Hong Kong as a card, but will only end up shooting yourselves in the foot.", "description": "Some American politicians have kept bent on passing Hong Kong-related bills including the so-called \"Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019\", ignoring the facts and confounding right with wrong.
