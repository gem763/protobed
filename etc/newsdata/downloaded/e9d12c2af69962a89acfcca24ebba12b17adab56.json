At first blush it doesn\u2019t seem like an auspicious time to invest in luxury\u2014and indeed, luxury stocks as a group are down 7.5% so far in 2019, according to Morningstar.\n\nStill, investors shouldn\u2019t be so quick to shelve luxury holdings. While stocks, like fashion, tend to go in and out of favor, the world\u2019s top luxury brands are made to last. One major reason: \u201cOn the supply side you have massive barriers to entry,\u201d says Edouard Aubin, head of Luxury Goods research at Morgan Stanley Research.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing population of young, affluent consumers\u2013namely in China\u2013is driving growing demand even in the face of slower global economic growth.\n\nCompetitive Advantage That\u2019s Hard to Mimic\n\nThere are many factors that have allowed the world\u2019s leading luxury brands to hold their reign, but a big one is heritage. Most of the top brands have roots in France or Italy, says Aubin, and have time on their side. Cartier, Hermes, and Louis Vuitton have been around for more than 150 years. Gucci celebrates its centennial in 2021. Even the \u201cnewer\u201d brands, such as Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent, are more than 70 years old, he says.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the list of top luxury brands by sales has essentially not changed in the last two decades; only the order has changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few sectors in Europe that is unlikely to be disrupted by Chinese or American players,\u201d he says. Most luxury brands, moreover, are relatively immune to trade tensions with China because the products are produced in Europe and exported to China\n\nGrowing Addressable Market\n\nMost investors assume that as goes China, so goes luxury. It\u2019s true that China is a key part of the equation. It represents 35% of luxury goods spending today and more than 70% of the category\u2019s growth.\n\nBut slower economic expansion in China doesn\u2019t necessarily portend weak growth for luxury. The reason: A booming population of young, mass-affluent consumers, many of whom are the only child of parents who are the only child and have two sets of grandparents helping to fund their lifestyles, says Aubin. The one caveat to this thesis, Aubin says, is consumer debt. While it\u2019s hard to know exactly how much debt Chinese consumers are taking on, it is a risk factor to follow.\n\nU.S. millennials and Generation Z may also be driving additional demand for luxury\u2014a trend that is amplified by women who stay single for longer. Younger consumers also seem to be emphasizing quality over quantity, adds Nicole Kornitzer, manager of the Buffalo International fund.\n\nConglomerates May Have An Edge\n\nWhile luxury companies benefit from favorable supply and demand dynamics, consolidation has only added to their competitive fortresses.\n\nFor these and other reasons, Paris-based Kornitzer counts the world\u2019s two largest luxury conglomerates, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering, among her top 10 holdings.\n\nIn addition to Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and Louis Vuitton, LVMH also owns such prominent brands as Christian Dior, Sephora, and Fendi, among others. Though Gucci is Kering\u2019s largest brand, its lineup ranges from Alexander McQueen to Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nBy owning a portfolio of luxury brands, conglomerates can spread the risk of designers falling in and out of fashion. More importantly, conglomerates are able to use their size to their advantage behind the scenes. They can afford to hire the best talent, invest in robust digital platforms, and leverage economies of scale to improve their margins and operations across their brands. Yet, from the consumer\u2019s perspective each brand appears to be unique.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s one thing for a brand to make a splash on the runway and quite another to offer upside in an investment portfolio. At current valuations, Kering stock may offer more room for upside, Kornitzer says. Its shares recently traded around US$500, or 16 times forward earnings.\n\nAubin\u2019s team, meanwhile, has an \u201coverweight\u201d rating on LVMH, whose Dior brand is one of the largest and fastest-growing in China, with cosmetics sales leading the way. At the same time demand for premium cosmetics is growing, this category within luxury tends to offer additional benefits. Makeup preferences tend not to change quickly, products need to be replenished, and they can\u2019t be bought and sold on consignment.", "description": "Strong brands and a growing young, affluent consumer base will buoy the sector long term", "authors": ["Sarah Max"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110429/social", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
