And part of it is Florida is not an island full of people of color. We have seen him again and again pick on anywhere color is involved,\" Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room\" when asked about Trump's change in tone.\n\nThe comments came several hours after Trump appeared to signal a significant shift in his concern over the storm, which was previously projected to heavily impact the US territory of Puerto Rico. Earlier this week, as the island's residents prepared for the hurricane -- which then largely spared the island -- Trump harshly criticized the territory's government and praised himself.\n\nOn Thursday, following news that officials expect Dorian to make landfall in Florida, the President announced that he was canceling a scheduled trip to Poland to deal with the storm, which is expected to reach the state as a Category 4 hurricane on Labor Day.\n\n\"But I don't really criticize (Trump for) sticking up and trying to modify the impacts of the hurricane on Florida. I just wish that he would be evenhanded when it comes to the Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico,\" Beyer said.\n\nRead More", "description": "A Democratic House member said Thursday that President Donald Trump's change in tone on Hurricane Dorian after it was announced that the storm will make landfall in Florida, skirting Puerto Rico, is because the state \"is not an island full of people of color.\"", "authors": ["Devan Cole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170505184923-don-beyer-super-tease.jpg"}
