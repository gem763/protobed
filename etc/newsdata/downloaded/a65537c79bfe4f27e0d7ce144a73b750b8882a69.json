The job, for a so-called \u201cstagiaire\u201d or intern, asks for a \u201ccommitted supporter of the Conservative party\u201d to work for the party\u2019s parliamentary group in the EU capital.\n\nThe Tories were ridiculed by opposition MEPs, who said the planned hiring showed even Mr Johnson\u2019s own parliamentarians had no confidence that he would stick to his word.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Could this be a sign that even Tory MEPs don\u2019t believe the government bluster that we will be leaving on 31 October?\u201d\n\nDespite being a hire for the Tories\u2019 group rather than the party, the job advert specifies a start date of 1 November and says candidates should have \u201cactive political experience, perhaps in CCHQ, in a constituency office, in campaigning locally, or in student politics\u201d.\n\nThe party denies that the hire represents an admission that Brexit will not happen and says the intern will in fact be tasked with \u201dmaintaining ties\u201d between the Tory party and their former European Parliament group after Brexit.\n\nIt also asks for applicants to have \u201ca basic knowledge of the European Union; have good writing skills who can summarise discussions and reports\u201d.\n\nThe role is described as \u201ca great opportunity to learn more about the work of the European Parliament and the European Union, gaining practical experience in a demanding political office\u201d.\n\nLabour MEP Julie Ward told The Independent: \u201cIt is good to see the European Conservative Party is preparing to, not only respect the Safeguard Act, but is planning for the UK\u2019s inevitable extension.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
