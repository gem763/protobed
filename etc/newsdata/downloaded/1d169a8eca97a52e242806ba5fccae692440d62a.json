The U.S. central bank lowered borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.\n\n\"We still expect the Fed will cut rates in the fourth quarter, but squaring this soft read on the consumer, business investment and a slight rebound in underlying inflation admittedly pulls the Fed in opposite directions,\" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1% last month as an increase in outlays on recreational goods and motor vehicles was offset by a decrease in spending at restaurants and hotels.\n\nData for July was revised slightly down to show consumer spending increasing 0.5% instead of the previously reported 0.6% advance. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending gaining 0.3% last month.\n\nConsumer spending has been blunting some of the hit on the economy from the U.S.-China trade war, which has sunk business investment and manufacturing.\n\nBut with tariffs on Chinese goods broadened to include consumer goods, spending is slowing. There are worries that weak business investment and sluggish profit growth could constrain companies' ability to continue hiring more workers, and undermine consumer spending.\n\nThe tariffs are causing anxiety among consumers. Consumer confidence dropped significantly in September, a survey from the Conference Board showed this week.\n\nA survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed a small increase in sentiment this month, with consumers voicing rising levels of \"economic uncertainty.\"\n\nConsumer spending surged at a 4.6% annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest pace in 4-1/2 years. Economists said August's small gain put consumer spending on track to grow at between a 2.5% and 3% rate in the third quarter.\n\n\"Consumer spending had been robust somewhat earlier in the year so slowing is not too surprising,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \"But this cooling is happening a little more quickly and significantly than we had expected.\"\n\nThe dollar was flat against a basket of currencies, U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. Stocks on Wall Street eased.\n\n\n\n\n\nUNDERLYING INFLATION FIRMING\n\nIn another report on Friday, the Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.2% in August, weighed down by weak demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components, and computers and electronic products.\n\nThese so-called core capital goods orders were unchanged in July. Economists had forecast core capital goods orders unchanged in August.\n\nShipments of core capital goods rose 0.4% last month after falling 0.6% in July. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Business investment declined at its steepest pace in 3-1/2 years in the second quarter.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell last week said trade policy tensions, which \"have waxed and waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S. investment and exports,\" adding that U.S. central bank contacts had told policymakers that trade policy uncertainty \"has discouraged them from investing in their businesses.\"\n\nThe weak core capital goods data and tepid consumer spending led economists to cut their third-quarter GDP estimates by as much as six-tenths of a percentage point to as low as a 1.3% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.0% rate last quarter, slowing from the January-March quarter's brisk 3.1% pace.\n\nStory continues", "description": "U.S. consumer spending barely rose in August and business investment remained subdued amid lingering trade tensions, prompting economists to slash their economic growth estimates for the third quarter.
