The 36-year-old upholsterer in Damietta went to join the rallies last month, tearing down a large poster of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi with hundreds of other protesters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about politics, but I have been struggling to have a decent life for my children since the president came to power,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cTheir [the government\u2019s] economists say everything is improving, but how can that be if my income has almost halved in value?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

With non-governmental organisations banned from conducting any surveys, the figure could be much higher.\n\nThe recent protests were sparked by a series of videos posted by businessman Mohamed Ali, who alleged that public funds had been used to build hotels and palaces for the president and members of the army.\n\nMr Ali\u2019s call for protests went viral \u2013 yet many Egyptians who watched them did not expect anything to happen. However, on 20 September, hundreds of demonstrators across different cities managed to shake al-Sisi\u2019s confidence by chanting against his regime.\n\nLast week, Egyptian security forces blocked access to Cairo\u2019s revolutionary heart \u2013 Tahrir Square. The city\u2019s main metro stations were closed and traffic was diverted, while police vans roamed, their sirens echoing through the empty streets. Yet barricading the square did not keep everyone at home \u2013 dozens of protesters were dispersed by tear gas in several districts around and just outside the metropolis.\n\nThe scenes are a far cry from 2017, when young Egyptians who wanted their voices to be heard were invited to Sisi\u2019s World Youth Forum, with 3,000 delegates from around the world. Egypt ran an advertising campaign for the conference, where the opening scene showed a woman in heels in a European-looking street while an English voice-over said: \u201cIf there are streets you can\u2019t cross and clothes you can\u2019t wear, we need to talk.\u201d\n\nNow, just two years later, it is clear that Egypt is anything but a place for youth to be heard.\n\n\u201cThis is all happening while al-Sisi builds palaces for his family and friends,\u201d Ayman said in frustration.\n\nThe president has repeatedly blamed any dissent on political Islam, but secular Egyptians and high-profile socialist figures have all been arrested. According to the Cairo-based Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, more than 2,800 politicians, journalists, human rights lawyers, and ordinary citizens were detained.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Another lawyer, Mohamed El-Baker, was representing an activist before being told he was also being charged in the same case.\n\nBut the president nevertheless appears to have been caught by surprise. Al-Sisi announced last week that subsidies would be restored for 1.8 million citizens.\n\nFor Timothy E Kaldas, a non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, this shows that the government concluded it needed to try and address people\u2019s discontent, rather than just trying to repress it away \u2013 at least for now. \u201cThat said, the arrest of many leading opposition figures, who continue to be held, reflects a fear that this discontent that drew people to the street is a tinder in society waiting to be sparked and mobilised,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen al-Sisi arrived back from his trip to the UN General Assembly in New York, he was greeted by a pro-government rally awaiting him at an off-limit area in Cairo\u2019s airport. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wake up on a Friday, it\u2019s not worth it. Don\u2019t worry about anything,\u201d he jokingly told his supporters.\n\nAnother pro-government gathering took place in Cairo\u2019s area of Nasser City, where hundreds gathered, flanked by security, and waved the Egyptian flag wearing T-shirts of the president.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Egypt is similar to a film shooting scene, where furniture pieces are put carefully in place but, in reality, these pieces are merely a decoration,\u201d said Mohamed Zarea, the head of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies. \u201cThe flames have been distinguished but another fire is waiting to be sparked \u2013 unless a major change happens.\u201d\n\nThe author\u2019s name has been changed for security reasons", "description": "Ayman had always dismissed the idea of protesting against Egypt\u2019s government; hesitant to get himself involved unnecessarily in politics.
