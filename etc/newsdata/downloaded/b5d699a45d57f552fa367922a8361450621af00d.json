Within only a few weeks as prime minister, he has already lost the first series of key votes in Parliament, his parliamentary majority, the goodwill of Conservative Party moderates \u2014 including his own brother \u2014 and the patience of E.U. leaders. He may still be able to avoid becoming one of the shortest-serving prime ministers in U.K. history by regaining the upper hand in a potential snap election, but some of the fallout of his recent moves appear more difficult to reverse: A perception at home and abroad that British democracy is now itself at stake.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201ctravesty of democracy\u201d that Boris Johnson is shutting down Parliament in a time of national crisis.\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Democrats will continue to fight to stop this Brexit mess altogether.

Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks and suggestions that he could ignore a law requiring him to seek a deadline extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit have both raised alarm bells in European capitals.\n\nBy comparing Johnson to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban \u2014 who has faced criticism for expanding government control over the judiciary, the press and academia \u2014 Austrian newspaper Der Standard was among the more fretful voices.\n\n\u201cJohnson and his henchmen clearly think Brexit is more important than democracy and the rule of law,\u201d the paper\u2019s London correspondent, Sebastian Borger, wrote.\n\nGermany\u2019s international public broadcaster DW was more blunt.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson, the UK dictator,\u201d blared the headline of an opinion piece by the network\u2019s senior European correspondent, Barbara Wesel.\n\nThe bemused undertone that previously accompanied some European commentary on the Brexit chaos is gone. Suspending Parliament in the way Johnson did, wrote political scientist Yascha Mounk in France\u2019s Le Monde newspaper, constituted the \u201cmost flagrant attack on democracy that Britain has ever known.\u201d\n\nIf populism blighted \u201cthe most entrenched of democracies,\u201d said an editorial in the French paper, it \u201cwould be terrible news for the entire continent.\u201d\n\nThe underlying fear is that there is very little E.U. members can do at this point to bail Britain out \u2014 and even if they tried, they might end up making matters worse. Members of the European Parliament may officially condemn Johnson\u2019s move to suspend the British Parliament this week, according to a draft resolution seen by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine. But most other routes appear closed, amid the possibility of a looming no-deal Brexit.\n\nThreatening Britain with some of the potentially more effective measures the bloc has deployed against increasingly illiberal member states Hungary and Poland \u2014 including lawsuits and sanctions procedures \u2014 would take far too long. Apart from the time frame, even the mere possibility of such measures being triggered could play into the hands of E.U. opponents in Britain, who have long rallied against E.U. interference in national politics.\n\nThe sight of Westminster in deep chaos may still have an impact in Europe, however, where concerns over Britain\u2019s rule of law and democracy might end up strengthening the argument for a strong E.U. The E.U. has previously been criticized for being too weak on member states that violate democratic values. Recently, however, the bloc\u2019s institutions appear to have \u201cwoken up to threats to democracy,\u201d the executive director of Berlin-based NGO, Democracy Reporting International, Michael Meyer-Resende, wrote this summer, welcoming more assertive E.U. moves against Poland.\n\nIronically, popular support for the E.U. in member states that were recently sued by the E.U. remains far higher than in Britain; in Poland, approval still exceeded 70 percent last year.\n\nBut those numbers don\u2019t ensure that the E.U. will prevail over governments willing to bend the rules of democracy. Some E.U.-proponents fear that a public discourse on Brussels that has little resemblance to reality \u2014 stirred by politicians fed up with E.U. rules \u2014 could eventually shift opinions in Poland, Hungary and elsewhere, too.\n\nThe prime example of this is Britain. When Johnson was still the Telegraph newspaper\u2019s Brussels correspondent, his \u201cBrussels-bashing stories shaped British politics,\u201d the Guardian recently concluded in an analysis.\n\nAmong Britain\u2019s E.U.-skeptics, the tales from Brussels \u2014 circulated by Johnson and others \u2014 were widely deployed in public discourse, even as they drew comparisons with fiction literature in Europe.\n\n\u201cWhen we read [Johnson\u2019s] articles, we always felt he had been to a different event from the one we were at,\u201d former German TV correspondent Rolf-Dieter Krause told the Guardian.\n\nAs a politician, Johnson is now once again accused of creating false narratives that resonate domestically, but make an unwarranted mockery of democratic institutions and processes \u2014 with potentially dire results. During the May 2016 speech, Johnson suggested that one of the reasons E.U. democracy was not working was that \u201cthere is simply no common political culture in Europe; no common media, no common sense of humor or satire; and \u2014 this is important \u2014 there is no awareness of each other\u2019s politics.\u201d\n\nWe should be so much more positive about the UK and what we can do. I want us to get this thing done. \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7#LeaveOct31 pic.twitter.com/KnFOk4RSjc \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) September 8, 2019\n\nHis European critics would beg to differ: The one who lacks awareness of their politics, they say, is in fact Johnson himself. When he claimed last week that Brexit negotiations were showing signs of progress, European politicians interviewed by my colleague Michael Birnbaum were once again baffled by Johnson\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s totally unrealistic. He\u2019s saying if you don\u2019t do what I say, I\u2019ll commit suicide. There are no negotiations with this government,\u201d said Anne Mulder, a Dutch lawmaker. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s for domestic use. But everybody reads the British papers.\"\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
