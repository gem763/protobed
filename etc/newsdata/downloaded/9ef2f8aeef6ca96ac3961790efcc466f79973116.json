I\u2019m thankful that Bradley Byrne vote with me \u2014 voted \u2018no.'\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that other Republicans voted \u2018yes\u2019 based on public pressure, Democrat pressure, media pressure, or whatever you want to call it,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the bottom line is if you really know what is going on in Syria with the Kurds and with Turkey, the right decision was to vote \u2018no\u2019 on this resolution that the Democrats put forth that went out of its way to attack Donald Trump for the sole purpose of helping the Democrats win the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nAs for his GOP colleagues that voted for the resolution, Brooks said it was a matter of not fully understanding the circumstances.\n\n\u201cIn my judgment, they did not do their homework,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not know the fact, and as a consequence, they cast a bad vote.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Alabama Republican, the Trump administration had become aware of Turkey\u2019s plan to have an incursion into Syria, which according to White House officials, would have occurred with or without a U.S. presence in Northern Syria.\n\n\u201c[T]he president was put into the position of having to decide whether to leave 50 or 100 American troops, maybe more depending on how broad Turkey\u2019s advance was, to defend against over 15,000 Turkish soldiers with the calamity that would have likely occurred, or to move them to safe ground to save American lives and decrease the risk an escalation that could result in a war with Turkey.\u201d\n\nBrooks pointed out there were 5,000 U.S. soldiers and nuclear weapons sanctioned in Turkey. He said if an armed conflict were to break out with the United States and Turkey, a NATO ally od the United States it would out those troops and nuclear weapons at risk.\n\n\u201cIt would have been folly to sacrifice the lives of those 50 to 100 American soldiers in the face of an onslaught of 15,000 or more Turkish soldiers, bearing in mind further that you had elements to the south on the other side of the Turks. The Turks were coming from the north. You had Russian and various elements of Syrian forces to the south that were marching north, where our troops would have been between two different sets of fighters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m thankful President Trump decided to minimize the risk of a war with Turkey, minimize the risk of these American soldiers being slaughtered simply because they would be overwhelmed by the numbers.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Representative Mo Brooks (R-AL) was just one of 60 out of the 189 Republican members of Congress to vote against a resolution opposing\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces in Northern Syria. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/alabam-rep-mo-brooks.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
