And it\u2019s a feat that wouldn\u2019t happen again for another 11 years, when Jimmie Foxx accomplished it while playing for the Boston Red Sox.\n\nOn Aug. 11, 1929, Ruth, while playing for the Yankees, hit the homer off Willis Hudlin at League Park in Cleveland. According to the Associated Press, the ball flew outside the park and rolled down the street into the hands of an Indians fan who returned it to Ruth in exchange for $20 and his autograph. The bat, on the other hand, remained a mystery. \u201cNo one knew it still existed,\u201d Wells told Penta.\n\nIn fact, Ruth, who finished his career with 714 home runs, had given the mystical slugger to his friend and former mayor of Suffern, New York, Jim Rice in the mid 1940s. \u201cThe fact that he held onto the bat for nearly 15 years before gifting it shows that it really meant something to him,\u201d Wells says. \u201cIt was a big discovery.\u201d\n\nThe bat remained in the Rice family for 75 years. After Jim and his wife, Ethyl, passed away, they handed it down to their son, Terry, who kept it hidden behind the television set in the family\u2019s den for fear of theft or damage. \u201cIt was getting too valuable for the Rices to keep,\u201d Wells says.\n\nThe bat will be auctioned off by SCP Auctions next month. SCP Auctions\n\nThe Louisville Slugger received a grade 10, the highest-grade possible from authenticators. \u201cIt\u2019s in impeccable shape and has no visible cracks,\u201d Wells says. It even bears marks from where Ruth kicked mud off his cleats and has impressions from where the bat made contact with the ball as well as some green paint from resting against the dugout in between hits.\n\nSCP Auctions sold another of Ruth\u2019s bats, which he used to hit the first ever home run at Yankee Stadium on opening day, April 18, 1923, in 2004 for $1.265 million. \u201cIt is still a world- record price for any bat,\u201d Wells says. The 500 th Career Home Run Bat is estimated to sell for at least $1 million with the potential for up to several million dollars.\n\nIt\u2019s part of SCP\u2019s Fall Premier Auction taking place online from Nov. 27 through Dec. 14 th .
