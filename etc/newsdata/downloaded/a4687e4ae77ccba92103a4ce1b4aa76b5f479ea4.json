Stay previously told jurors she played dead after Haskell shot her in the head, then called police as he headed to her grandparents\u2019 house to continue killing.\n\n\u201cI hope when you die, you will get the punishment you deserve from God. Only God can help you now,\u201d Stay said in her victim impact statement, staring straight ahead as Haskell sat emotionless.\n\nShe added: \u201cI know you will die from a lethal injection. It was the jury\u2019s decision and respect. That doesn\u2019t change what you did but I hope that when you die the punishment of God will come. \u201d\n\nThe emotional two-day hearing included testimony from Haskell\u2019s older brother. The jury deliberated for less than five hours before determining his sentence.\n\nDuring his trial, Haskell\u2019s defense attorneys did not deny the 39-year-old committed the horrific crime, arguing instead that he was driven to kill by his mental-health problems and the voices in his head.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing, attorney Neal Davis fought for Haskell\u2019s life\u2014 arguing in his closing statement he deserves to \u201cdie in prison\u201d and spend the rest of his life thinking about his crimes. Doug Durham, another defense attorney, slammed prosecutors for seeing a sentence based on \u201canger, hatred, fear, vengeance because of this terrible, terrible crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cSentencing him to death would be an act of vengeance, not justice,\u201d Davis said Friday.\n\nRobert Haskell, the convicted killer\u2019s older brother, told jurors he believes his sibling \u201cstill has good in him\u201d and won\u2019t be a future danger to society if he is sentenced to life in prison. \u201cI think that Ronnie can help other people,\u201d Robert Haskell said, adding that his brother had expressed remorse for the slayings over the phone. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has a full understanding of the actual events that transpired.\u201d\n\nA forensic psychologist also testified during the sentencing hearing, saying he predicted a \u201cvery low\u201d likelihood Haskell would commit future acts of violence.\n\nKnecht argued against the mentally ill defense on Friday, calling the death sentence \u201cthe moment of justice\u201d for the Stay family, while placing bullet casings for each of the six victims in front of the jury.\n\n\u201cThis is a case about a plan. A plan that was created in anger and fueled by vengeance. But the plan is not complete,\u201d Kent said before placing 20 more bullets to signify the other people Haskell wanted to kill.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors argued that Haskell carefully planned the slayings, even purchasing a FedEx uniform to wear as a disguise in order to gain entry to the Stay family\u2019s residence. Haskell also allegedly made a pit stop in Utah to steal a gun from his ex-girlfriend, and then purchased over 200 rounds of ammo.\n\nOn July 9, 2014, after stalking the Stay home for two days, Haskell knocked on the door dressed in his FedEx outfit, prosecutors recounted to the jury on Friday. Cassidy Stay, then 15, previously testified in court she opened the door and told Haskell her parents were not home.\n\nThe 39-year-old left, only to return an hour later and force himself inside the house. Cassidy Stay testified that she was tied up and held at gunpoint with her siblings when her parents finally arrived.\n\n\u201cI went through and told him my brothers and sisters names and ages. I was appealing to his humanity. I didn\u2019t think someone would hurt kids if they knew how old they were,\u201d Stay told jurors.\n\nCassidy Stay testified her family was forced to lay down in a row before Haskell began shooting them in the head. When he fled, Stay said she immediately called the police, who apprehended Haskell near her grandparents\u2019 home.\n\nLyon, 38, said the moment she heard about the murders, she knew her ex-husband was responsible.\n\n\u201cHe had carried through on the promise to make me watch my family die,\u201d said Lyon, who had been married to Haskell for 12 years before she left their Utah home in 2013.", "description": "Prosecutors said Haskell meticulously planned the mass murder of his ex-wife\u2019s family after their bitter divorce. \u201cHe is a manipulator, he is a liar,\u201d ADA Samantha Knecht said.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1968,w_3500,x_0,y_91/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570822207/RTR3Y7CI_eo8s4k", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
