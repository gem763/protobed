Two people have been killed, and there has been an attack on Jews in Germany.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aim, and that of all politicians, is to do everything to ensure you can live safely. And this day shows that it hasn\u2019t been enough, that we have to do more,\u201d she added.\n\nTwo people were shot dead, and two others injured, in the German city of Halle earlier Wednesday in an anti-Semitic attack as Jews marked the holy day of Yom Kippur.\n\nRabbi Ederberg said she had received many messages from people who were \u201cafraid\u201d.\n\n\u201cMany people told me they weren\u2019t coming because they were scared. That has to change,\u201d she added.\n\nThe rabbi blasted a \u201cresurgence of anti-Semitism in Germany,\u201d urging \u201ccivil society to oppose anyone who would use the term \u2018Jew\u2019 as an insult and to battle \u201call brown (fascistic) forces\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u201cStay vigilant\u201d \u2013\n\nMaintaining a ceremonial silence under the light rain, those present placed candles in front of the synagogue.\n\nSeveral people were carrying Israeli flags on their shoulders. Others unrolled a banner reading \u201cagainst all anti-Semitism\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was important to be here to show our solidarity with the Jewish community. An attack on Jews in Germany is an attack on all of us,\u201d said event organiser Sawsan Chebli, a Berlin city representative of Palestinian origin.\n\n\u201cSomething we thought impossible just a few years ago has reappeared. It\u2019s up to us to stay vigilant,\u201d said Verena Schoenwaelder, an atheist Berliner who attended with her young daughter.\n\n\u201cWe show solidarity,\u201d said imam Kadir Sanci.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is attacked, you have to support them. Today it\u2019s the Jews who are the victims, tomorrow it will be Muslims. Either way, let\u2019s stick together.\u201d\n\nAway from Berlin, several hundred people spontaneously gathered at the marketplace in Halle, placing candles and flowers on the ground.\n\nInterior Minister Horst Seehofer labelled the Halle killings an \u201canti-Semitic attack\u201d, likely carried out by a \u201cfar-right\u201d perpetrator.\n\nThe shooting sparked a lockdown in the city, before the suspect was captured.\n\nDuring his deadly rampage, the man had attempted to storm the synagogue in Halle with a shotgun and an automatic weapon but failed to breach its doors.\n\nShocked but unharmed, the 80 worshippers inside were later transferred to the city hospital, where they finished their prayers and broke their fast before being taken to a safe location, AFP learned.", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 Chancellor Angela Merkel joined people gathered at Berlin\u2019s main synagogue late Wednesday for a silent vigil, showing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/8b967c_german-chancellor-angela-merkel-met-rabbi-gesa-ederberg-members-jewish-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
