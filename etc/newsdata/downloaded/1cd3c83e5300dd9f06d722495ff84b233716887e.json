It could then receive Royal Assent by the end of the week, meaning it has passed into law. If the bill is passed unchanged, Parliament will be dissolved on Nov 6 ahead of what is set to be a five-week election campaign.", "description": "British lawmakers approved Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to hold a snap general election on Dec. 12.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db8c0b7a310cf3e97a377aa.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
