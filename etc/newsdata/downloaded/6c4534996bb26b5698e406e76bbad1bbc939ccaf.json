It takes a lot of sacrifice.\n\nLiving lean\n\nThe couple shares a tiny 400-square-foot apartment, and cuts costs at every opportunity. That means no meals out at restaurants, no car, no cable television or smartphones, and a monthly grocery bill of only $250.\n\nFor us it was a question of nudging our incomes up while keeping our expenses steady. - Celestian Rince\n\nWhile those lifestyle choices might sound dramatic, Williams said that being frugal comes naturally to the pair.\n\n\"I was never a big spender because I didn't have the money. We didn't make any major lifestyle changes when we decided we wanted to retire early,\" she said.\n\n\"For us it was a question of nudging our incomes up while keeping our expenses steady.\"\n\nThe only luxury Williams and Rince allow themselves is travel, something the pair makes a priority of throughout the year. In 2018, they spent a combined $9,815 on travel internationally and within Canada.\n\nStephanie and Celestian on a trip to Mexico. They say travel is one of their few lifestyle 'splurges.' (Submitted by Celestian Rince)\n\nKeeping your eye on the prize\n\nWilliams and Rince first decided to aim for early retirement in 2010, when they were each working jobs Williams described as \"horrible.\"\n\n\"Celestian was working minimum wage at a grocery store and I was working at a warehouse. It was pretty bad. We were thinking: is this what our lives are going to be like?\"\n\nDesperately searching for a way out, they discovered a blog called Early Retirement Extreme. It advises that you save upward of 50 per cent of your income in order to retire in 15 to 20 years.\n\nA lot of people think you need a lot more money than maybe you actually do, if you live a modest lifestyle. - Stephanie Williams\n\nThe pair embraced the challenge and soon found better-paying jobs. With slightly higher incomes, they've managed to accumulate $400,000 in retirement savings. In the next three years, they hope to have $700,000 in total.\n\nBut stashing away that much money \u2014 and living so frugally \u2014 does raise some eyebrows, even among their families.\n\n\"They thought I was a bit strange at first,\" said Rince.\n\n\"They think you're a little bit crazy,\" interjected Williams. \"He's really the odd one out among his relatives.\"\n\nA more modest, 'carefree' life\n\nCelestian and Stephanie plan to remain frugal in retirement, and are considering building a homestead on the Gulf Islands. (Submitted by Celestian Rince)\n\nWhile their saving regimen may be extreme, their retirement plans are not. Beyond a bit of travel and dreams of building a small cabin in the Gulf Islands, the pair don't plan on changing their daily routines very much.\n\n\"Pretty similar to what we have but more carefree,\" said Rince.\n\nEven though their generation has accrued record amount of personal debt, Williams and Rince believe that early retirement can be in reach for most young people \u2014 as long as they plan to live minimally, both in retirement and their working years. To inspire others, they've shared their saving journey on a blog.\n\n\"A lot of people think you need a lot more money than maybe you actually do, if you live a modest lifestyle,\" said Williams.", "description": "This couple shares a 400 square foot apartment, and cuts costs at almost every opportunity.
