Here are some of the worst pieces of advice you should always ignore:Huh? If you hear this from your well-wishers, they may not have your best interests in mind. If you and your partner have a lacklustre sex life and you want to do something about it, go ahead and zing it up. Otherwise there could be serious issues - to begin with, boredom can seep in and you may find yourself becoming emotionally distant.In other words, whenever you are together, do something special - organise a candle-lit dinner or plan for some extravagant getaways. Ask yourself, do you really want to be constantly under pressure to do something magical? While mini breaks once or twice a month may make sense, everyday activities can be enjoyable too. For instance, clean the house together or even walk the dog.Nothing could perhaps be more misleading. Ideally, if there are serious relationship issues, solve them first before becoming parents. If both of you have become hopelessly incompatible, you should reconsider being together in the first place - in such a situation, having a child may not be a brilliant idea.On the contrary, a neutral third party observer might help you address the elephant in the room. If there's a breakdown in communication, a counsellor might help you to reconnect and sort issues out.", "description": "While you work hard to turn your marriage into a grand success, try to ignore the following pieces of useless advice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/aug/marriages1566463015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
