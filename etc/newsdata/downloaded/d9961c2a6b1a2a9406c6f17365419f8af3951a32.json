Just don\u2019t refer to him as the new Usain Bolt, though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m me,\u201d said Lyles, who dyed his hair silver for the big occasion. \u201cAnd if you like me, I\u2019ll happily entertain you. It\u2019s my time.\u201d\n\nHe certainly took a little bit of time to take over the race.\n\nTrailing going around the bend, Lyles kicked it into gear to pass Adam Gemili of Britain . Lyles finished in a time of 19.83 seconds to beat an exhausted Andre De Grasse of Canada by 0.12 seconds. Alex Quinonez of Ecuador was third.\n\nEven behind that late, Lyles, who grew up in Alexandria, Virginia, wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those situations where I knew I had to get out and I saw they were moving on the turn and I just started pumping my arms on the turn. I knew I could sling off and grab the momentum,\u201d Lyles explained. \u201cBecause no matter where I am in the race, I will always be able to come back.\u201d\n\nAfter the race, the party was on. Lyles waved the American flag, kneeled a few times and kissed the track. It was rather subdued for the sprinter known for his dynamic dance moves.\n\nPerhaps he\u2019s saving his best stuff for 10 months from now at the Tokyo Games.\n\nAt this version of the championships, he threw his energy into winning the 200.\n\nNow that the box is checked, he\u2019s thinking bigger: Running the 100 and 200 in Tokyo. It could be quite a showdown with teammate Christian Coleman, who won the 100 at worlds and then skipped the 200. He plans to double as well. Same with De Grasse, who did both at worlds and took bronze in the 100.\n\n\u201cI will be ready when Tokyo 2020 comes,\u201d De Grasse said.\n\nAs a reminder of his goal - to win gold - Lyles put it into his phone and muttered it to himself over and over while he was driving. When it finally happened, he didn\u2019t know how to really react.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like something you\u2019ve imagined so many times in your head that one you actually active it it\u2019s like I thought, \u2018We already did this?\u2019\u201d Lyles said. \u201cFinally, to have done it feels unbelievable. It does feel good that I\u2019m at the end of the season and we came out with the ultimate victory, which is a gold medal.\u201d\n\nHis championships aren\u2019t over. He\u2019ll likely team with Coleman and Justin Gatlin as part of the U.S. 4x100 men\u2019s relay team. Lyles was coy on his relay leg.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a secret,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t be giving up U.S. confidential information.\u201d\n\nDe Grasse began to take notice of Lyles last season.\n\n\u201cHe reminded me of my younger self, the way he runs,\u201d said De Grasse.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gold medal secured, Noah Lyles took a lap around the sparsely filled stadium with a big decision weighing on him - vanilla or Oreo milkshake?", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/qatar_athletics_worlds_81739_c0-169-4034-2521_s1770x1032.jpg?646a563ea88dc0e6e656fe0e9fdb42dae3c26124", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
