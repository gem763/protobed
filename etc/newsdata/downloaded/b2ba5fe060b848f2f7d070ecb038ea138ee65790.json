Here\u2019s what you need to know.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck in \"Joker.\" (Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe weeks leading up to the release of Todd Phillips\u2019s \u201cJoker\" have been a journey. The gritty supervillain movie, which is the latest installment in the fitful DC cinematic universe, won Best Picture at the Venice Film Festival, capturing a measure of the artistic credibility that superhero fans have long craved for the genre. The film and Warner Brothers, the studio that produced it, got pulled into the roiling debate over how best to prevent gun violence in America. Phillips presented himself as a victim of left-wing censoriousness. And the Texas Department of Public Safety reportedly published a bulletin warning of a threatened mass shooting on Oct. 4, during a \u201cJoker\u201d screening, leading the Army Criminal Investigation Command to caution service members at Fort Sill in Oklahoma about the possibility of violence during the movie\u2019s screenings.\n\nEven by the standards of our present moment, when politics is as often as not conducted through pop culture, these developments presage an unusually contentious pop-culture news cycle. Here are three strategies for getting through the coming conversation without ending up in a mental state that inspires you to don your own clown makeup:\n\n1. Know the facts about movies and real-world violence: One of the reasons the conversation around \u201cJoker\u201d has gotten so heated so quickly is that over and over again, pop culture has been incorrectly cited as an influence in notorious crimes, especially mass killings. By that false logic, \u201cJoker\u201d could be the latest culprit, especially since a growing movement of so-called \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d men have committed a series of violent crimes. But, as Scott Mendelson writes in Forbes, the logic doesn\u2019t hold up if you examine the real record:\n\nJames Holmes didn\u2019t dress up as the Joker nor was he explicitly inspired by Chris Nolan\u2019s Batman sequel when he opened fire during a midnight screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d in Aurora, Colorado on July 20, 2012. Columbine school shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were not bullied outcasts or members of the \u201cTrench Coat Mafia.\u201d They were not cosplaying as Neo and reenacting \u201cThe Matrix\u201d\u2019s climactic office lobby shootout when they shot up their school on April 19, 1999. Even the attack on a subway ticket tooth [sic] employee initially blamed on \u201cMoney Train\u201d was unrelated to that Woody Harrelson/Wesley Snipes action-comedy. The thieves who infamously forced robbery victims to drink bleach before shooting them planned to commit a robbery/homicide months prior to watching Magnum Force. There are a few movies over the decades, like \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d and \u201cNatural Born Killers,\u201d which have inspired real-life violence. However, and this is a key distinction, they have mostly inspired the specifics of violent action rather than the violent act itself. Individual pieces of pop culture, be it movies, TV or video games, don\u2019t turn empathetic people into murderers. We know this because the science says as much again, and again and again. Even the rise of violence in PG-13 flicks (as post-Columbine pressures and the allure of worldwide box office glory led Hollywood to nip-n-tuck arguably R-rated genre films like \u201cTaken\u201d and \u201cWhite House Down\u201d into the PG-13 box) ran parallel with a decrease in violent crime from 1985 to 2015.\n\nIf solving mass violence was simply a matter of not releasing anything edgier than \u201cBambi\u201d in theaters, our political debates might be simpler, though our pop culture would definitely be duller. (And really, have you seen \u201cBambi\u201d lately? Youthful trauma for days.) It\u2019s not, though! Keeping the facts in mind, both when it comes to pop culture we\u2019re inclined to support and that we\u2019re inclined to disdain, will keep our conversations at a more manageable temperature \u2014 and will make a small contribution toward keep our policy debates focused where they belong.\n\n2. Remember that Phillips isn\u2019t wrong \u2014 outrage is a commodity: There are definitely times it\u2019s worth getting angry about popular culture. But, as Phillips said in a controversial interview with the Wrap, it\u2019s something that can be monetized. For all that he\u2019s using criticism of \u201cJoker\u201d to cast himself as a misunderstood victim, it\u2019s also obviously the case that Phillips and Warner Brothers can benefit from being seen as martyrs to free speech and artistic integrity. It may be a niche play, though with a reported $55 million budget, \u201cJoker\u201d can afford to appeal to a narrower, more passionate audience than a behemoth like \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d which may have cost more than eight times as much to make and advertise.\n\nNot all the press about \u201cJoker\u201d in the run-up to its release has been positive. But all of it is essentially free, and the sheer volume of discussion and the stakes of the pre-movie warnings have all positioned it as an Important Artistic Event. None of this means that if you truly hate \u201cJoker\u201d or think it\u2019s dangerous \u2014 or if you think it\u2019s a landmark work of cinema \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t make your case. Just remember that there\u2019s a difference between building an argument and signing on to do unpaid work for a studio\u2019s publicity department. You\u2019re under no obligation to do the latter.\n\n3. And most of all, make up your mind after you\u2019ve seen the movie \u2014 or be clear, but qualified, about why you\u2019ve decided not to go: I know this seems like putting the cart before the horse in an environment where cultural consumption is considered a moral and political act. By that logic, you have to figure out how you feel about a book, movie, television show or album before you can decide whether it\u2019s okay to spend money on it.\n\nBut while I think it\u2019s perfectly legitimate to decide that you simply don\u2019t want to watch, read or listen to something, and while it can be revealing and interesting to explain why you\u2019ve made that decision, it is also true that you absolutely cannot speak authoritatively about the content and execution of something you\u2019ve decided not to consume. You simply can\u2019t do it. The power of culture comes from the fact that it can be elliptical and indirect, that it does work that can\u2019t be captured by a literal description. It\u2019s factually accurate to say that that \u201cLittle Women\u201d is a novel about four girls during and after the Civil War, but that brief description does nothing to capture the work\u2019s appeal and lasting power, just as describing \u201cPain and Gain\u201d as a Michael Bay movie about criminal bodybuilders can\u2019t come close to communicating the movie\u2019s strange auteur qualities.\n\nSo if you want to have an opinion about \u201cJoker,\u201d at least let it be your own. Buy a ticket and donate the equivalent of the purchase price to a cause or charity of your choice if your conscience is troubled about it. Consider the performances, the script, the framing of the shots and anything else that helps you determine what you think the movie is trying to say, and what it succeeds in getting across. You\u2019ll be able to talk about \u201cJoker\u201d from a position of real information. And you\u2019ll be able to judge what everyone else \u2014 including me, after I see it next week \u2014 is saying about \u201cJoker,\u201d too.", "description": "Know the facts.
