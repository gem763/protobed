(John Woodrow Cox/TWP)\n\nUpdated at 6:46 a.m.\n\nMetro said normal service is back on its three rail lines -- Blue, Orange and Silver -- after Monday\u2019s crash in which two trains collided.\n\nUPDATED: Orange/Silver/Blue Line Delay: Metro has resumed normal operations at Farragut West. \u2014 Metrorail Info (@Metrorailinfo) October 8, 2019\n\nOriginal post at 6:00 a.m.\n\nRiders on Metro\u2019s Blue, Orange and Silver lines should expect delays Tuesday morning until 6:30 a.m., the transit agency said on Twitter.\n\nOrange/Silver/Blue Line Delay: Expect residual delays until approximately 630 am due to an earlier incident at Farragut West. \u2014 Metrorail Info (@Metrorailinfo) October 8, 2019\n\nThe delays on the lines come a day after two trains collided early Monday morning, causing nightmare commutes for passengers on those same three lines.\n\nAn initial finding of the investigation showed one of the trains was traveling 11 mph when it hit a stationary train outside the Farragut West stop. Investigators are trying to figure out the primary cause of the crash.\n\n[Overnight collision of 2 trains causes nightmare commute on Metro's Blue, Orange and Silver lines]\n\nNo passengers were on the trains, which were returning to their rail yards. Two train operators were treated and released at area hospitals, officials said.\n\nOfficials had said that both trains involved in the crash were left on the track all day Monday because they needed to collect evidence. And because Metro did want to cause more disruptions by moving them while the system was running.\n\nGetting the trains off the track required heavy utility prime movers, which are like a tug boat or tow truck, and it is a process that typically takes several hours because they move at slow speeds. The trains involved in the crash were 3000-series and they are \u201ccoupled\u201d so they have to be moved in pairs.", "description": "Riders on Metro's Blue, Orange and Silver lines should expect delays until 6:30 a.m.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uM4j2-SAppTVf5V3ip6uKv1SwOE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T6QUZWWVZNDMJOMMIEFGDLQ5TY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
