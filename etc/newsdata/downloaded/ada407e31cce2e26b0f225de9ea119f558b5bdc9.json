There is at least the potential that new technology might lead to a new global payment system fairly rapidly.\u201d\n\nAdrian also added that economists \u201clike innovation and competition.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Coindesk reports that Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Rob Kaplan said, \u201cWe have not at the Fed decided to pursue or drive to develop a digital currency, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re actively looking at and debating.\u201d\n\nKaplan also opined that \u201cthe dollar may not be the world\u2019s reserve currency forever,\u201d and admitted,\n\n\u201cPeople around the world are working really hard to try to find alternatives to dollars and dollar infrastructure because the more they\u2019re invested in that, the more susceptible they are to sanctions, tariffs and what\u2019s going on right now.\u201d\n\nAs reported in August, the Federal Reserve is \u201cseriously considering\u201d to develop a new and faster payments system for domestic use in the U.S.\n\nHowever, according to cryptocurrency author Mark Jeffrey, \"This is like watching the taxi industry try to respond to Uber: the attempts are somewhere between comical and sad.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve has never been forced to innovate and compete: they have absolutely no idea how to do it,\" he recently told Cryptonews.com.\n\nMeanwhile, outspoken crypto activist, Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano said in his newsletter on Wednesday that the \u201cidea of the United States creating a digital dollar is gaining steam\u201d among leading politicians and financiers in the country \u2013 with three congressmen and a number of ex-regulatory officials already lending their public support to the cause.\n\nTheir number includes J. Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the United States regulatory Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who co-wrote an op-ed article in the Wall Street Journal stating that if the USA succeeded in putting a man on the moon, it could also \u201csend the dollar to cyberspace.\u201d\n\nThe United States\u2019 northern neighbor, Canada, is also mulling a digital fiat project. The Financial Post\u2019s The Logic says it has obtained a copy of a Bank of Canada report that proposes introducing a digital Canadian dollar that would help the financial authority \u201ccombat the \u2018direct threat\u2019 of cryptocurrencies and collect more information on how people spend their money.\u201d\n\nSomewhat ominously, the bank says that one of the advantages of the digital fiat would be the fact that it could amass \u201cpersonal details [that are] not shared with payees, but could be shared with [the] police or tax authorities.\u201d\n\nThe bank says in the report that it needs to \u201cinnovate to stay in the game.\u201d\n\nAnd in Europe, the Banque de France (BdF)\u2019s deputy governor Denis Beau has called on financial authorities everywhere to standardize their regulatory systems for cryptocurrencies. He also stated that a China-style ban on cryptocurrencies would be one possible alternative approach to standardization, as would \u201cignoring\u201d Bitcoin and altcoins altogether.\n\nIn the release, Beau also states that \u201cblockchain technology and more broadly Distributed Ledger Technology could help answer market\u2019s needs and demands.\u201d\n\nAnd the same authority stated, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t refrain from experimenting with different forms of central bank-issued digital currency.\u201d\n\nHowever, in what was possibly a reference to Facebook\u2019s Libra project, the BdF stated,", "description": "Central banks and financial authorities in some of the world\u2019s leading economies are increasingly turning their attention to cryptocurrencies and digital fiats. Bloomberg reports that the American Federal Reserve is \u201cdragging its feet\u201d on digital fiat-related matters, with a \u201creal-time\u201d payment system \u201cfive to six years off.\u201d", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/8207aa4c67.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
