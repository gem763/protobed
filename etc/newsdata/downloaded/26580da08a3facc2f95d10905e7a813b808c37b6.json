Susan Wild was prepared for the criticism on Wednesday evening.\n\nShe'd come to Muhlenberg College ready to defend why Democrats in the House of Representatives were moving forward on an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\n\nIt was her first town hall since announcing that she, a freshmen Democrat who beat a Republican in a swing state in 2018, also supported the historic move put in motion by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in late September. The forum would offer a peek into how the ruckus in Washington was playing out at home.\n\nBut over about 90 minutes in a packed room full of hundreds of people, so many that officials had to bring in more chairs, impeachment was only raised a handful of times. Instead, people in this eastern Pennsylvania city wanted to know about bread-and-butter issues like health care and education and weren't preoccupied with the hysterics surrounding the quickly moving impeachment probe.\n\n\"I didn't come to Congress to pursue an impeachment inquiry,\" she told the hundreds who attended the town hall. \"It was the last thing in the world that I wanted.\"\n\nOverwhelmed by impeachment probe news?: Catch up on what happened this week\n\nFrom a stage flanked by Pennsylvania and American flags, Wild asked those in the audience to line up if they had any questions or concerns. One by one, they appeared at microphones on both sides of the event hall, but missing from their comments was the topic that was leading most newspapers and cable news.\n\n\"Do you believe that there should be a profit motive in health care, and if not, then we need to work toward Medicare for All,\" the first constituent at the microphone asked, also noting Wild's work on mental health after the recent death of her partner by suicide.\n\nThe second, a young woman, approached the microphone: \"Have you changed your position on the Green New Deal? Will you please sign on to co-sponsor\" the legislation, she asked, raising the climate change resolution posed by fellow freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent New York progressive.\n\nPompeo responds to Congress: Pompeo says he sent letter to Congress but did not provide Ukraine documents\n\nOf the 31 questions she took from constituents throughout the evening, impeachment came up just a few times. Only two people stood up to criticize her or Democrats for launching the inquiry, which started after a whistleblower charged that Trump used his office to go after a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIt wasn't until about 20 minutes into the event that someone brought up the issue. That person argued a majority of Americans don't support removing Trump from office and that the inquiry would prevent Congress from being able to solve problems and work together.\n\n\"I just want to make a point that there is another way,\" one man told Wild. \"I did admire when you said you did several, a few collaborative bills, bipartisan. Just don't hear much about that anymore, and I think more Americans would be happy to hear more of that and less of the accusation du jour.\" The crowd booed.\n\nHouse Democrats have been trying to stress they haven't lost sight of issues important to their constituents, even as they attempt to explain the inquiry to voters in their districts. Republicans want to sell Democrats as so hell-bent on impeaching Trump that they've abandoning kitchen-table issues.\n\nRep. Susan Wild: After partner's death, Rep. Susan Wild finds new mission in suicide prevention\n\nTo those who criticized her, Wild argued that impeachment would not be a distraction from the issues that got her elected. She pointed to her work on the Education and Labor committee and legislation aimed at lowering prescription drug prices.\n\nBut some backed Wild's call for an inquiry \u2013 and took it a step further.\n\n\"Why can\u2019t the House hold those who refuse to cooperate in contempt, find them, and put them in jail?\" one woman asked Wild as the crowd cheered. Wild pushed back, explaining that Congress' job was to investigate, not to jail or take the place of judges and juries. She also swatted away comments from another constituent who called the president \"crazy,\" saying she would not talk about the president's state of mind.", "description": "Of the 31 questions Rep.
