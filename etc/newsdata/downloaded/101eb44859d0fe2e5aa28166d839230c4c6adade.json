They reason that if 1 in 8 vapers turn against Trump in 2020 because he foreclosed their vaping options, it could jeopardize the election.\n\nWhy it matters: If Trump backs away from proposed enforcement policy, it would be the second time in recent weeks that political concerns prompted him to dial back government regulations.\n\nTrump's openness this summer to expanded background checks cooled after the gun lobby and campaign advisers warned about bad internal polling.\n\nOur thought bubble: There are four unsubstantiated assumptions about adult vapers in the case being presented to Trump:\n\nThey start out as Trump voters. They wouldn't vape anymore if they couldn't get the flavors. They are single-issue voters around vaping rights. The eventual Democratic nominee would be more vape-friendly.\n\nStill, the math can't be totally ignored, especially in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where Trump's 2016 win margins were so narrow and the number of adult vapers is relatively high.\n\nBy the numbers: More than 4 million people in swing states regularly used e-cigarettes in 2016, according to FDA-funded survey data published last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nIndustry experts say that number has increased significantly in recent years.\n\nBehind the scenes: The White House scheduled a listening session with conservative groups last Thursday after receiving intense backlash from GOP leaders and industry execs following the announcement of the ban.\n\nAmong the invitees: The Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Goldwater Institute, AFT and the Vapor Technology Association.\n\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Goldwater Institute, AFT and the Vapor Technology Association. But roughly 24 hours after invitations went out, the meeting was canceled.\n\n\"They\u2019re in chaos mode on this stuff because the backlash has been so resoundingly overpowering,\" one invitee said.\n\nA White House official says the meeting is expected to be rescheduled.\n\nThe bottom line: The political pressure points regarding the ban have gotten Trump's attention.", "description": "The number of adult vapers in key battleground states greatly outweighs the margins by which Trump won those states in 2016.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/8f2QPlAnqFanou-yb7LBwGgcnxU=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/22/1569186701747.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
