The country is currently struggling with the biggest resurgence in refugee arrivals since 2015, when more than a million people crossed into Europe.\n\nGreece is proposing to streamline a lengthy asylum process and deport rejected asylum seekers. A draft law is pending in the Greek parliament.\n\nThe law would reduce safeguards for people seeking international protection and put more pressure on overstretched administrative and judicial authorities, UNHCR said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe proposed changes will endanger people who need international protection,\u201d said Philippe Leclerc, the UNHCR representative in Greece.\n\n\u201cGreece has the opportunity to adopt a robust law through a genuine and constructive consultation to ensure fair and efficient asylum procedures in the country. This is an objective we are here to support.\u201d\n\nAthens has said it needs to clarify and consolidate rules governing migration and asylum. The present conservative administration has also been critical of the previous leftist government, which it said poorly managed the issue, resulting in thousands of people crammed into overcrowded camps.\n\nUNHCR said that under certain circumstances the right of a person to appeal against rejection of their asylum application is curtailed in such a manner that their rights to an effective legal remedy would be compromised.\n\nMore than 12,000 people arrived in Greece in September, the largest number in the three-and-a-half years since the EU agreed a deal with Turkey to seal the Aegean corridor to Europe.", "description": "The United Nations refugees agency UNHCR expressed concern on Thursday about Greek proposals to overhaul laws affecting asylum seekers, saying they could weaken the protection of refugees.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
