One person familiar with Mulvaney\u2019s thinking said the search came as Mulvaney himself was looking for an exit after ten months in the role, though people close to Mulvaney have denied he wanted to leave.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Mulvaney-White-House-Trump-Impeachment-Inquiry Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
