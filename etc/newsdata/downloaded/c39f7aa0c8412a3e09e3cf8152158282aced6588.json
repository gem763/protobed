But the Free Beacon did check.\n\nWho knew that Elizabeth Warren might be capable of shading a basic fact about her own biography to try to make herself more appealing to liberals?\n\nI assume the Beacon\u2019s scoop will shortly be shoveled by Warren apologists into the \u201cLarger Truth\u201d memory hole, which is essentially the opposite of \u201cfake but accurate.\u201d Yes, fine, it turns out that Warren herself didn\u2019t lose a job due to sexist policies, but many other women did. The Beacon story isn\u2019t fake but accurate, it\u2019s true but irrelevant!\n\nThe Riverdale Board of Education approved a second-year teaching contract for a young Elizabeth Warren, documents show, contradicting the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s repeated claims that she was asked not to return to teaching after a single year because she was \u201cvisibly pregnant.\u201d Minutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a \u201c2nd year\u201d contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren\u2019s resignation was \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d Warren\u2019s claim that she was dismissed after her first year of teaching because she was pregnant has become a cornerstone of her stump speeches. She has used it to both explain her jump from teaching into the legal world as well as to showcase the difficulties that women face in the workplace.\n\nIf you\u2019re coming to this story late, stop now and read Ed\u2019s post from last Thursday which has all the proverbial receipts about the lies Warren has told in public over the last few years about how she came to lose her job in 1971. Ed\u2019s post built on work by conservative Jeryl Bier, who\u2019s been compiling instances on Twitter and elsewhere of Warren giving different versions over the years of how she ended up unemployed. My favorite detail, though, is that the first person to call her out wasn\u2019t a right-winger \u2014 it was a far-leftist at Bernie-friendly \u201cJacobin\u201d magazine who noticed the shifting Warren narrative. Here was the story Warren was telling about her employment history as recently as 2007:\n\nI was married at nineteen and graduated from college after I\u2019d married, and my first year post-graduation I worked in a public school system with the children with disabilities. I did that for a year, and then that summer I didn\u2019t have the education courses, so I was on an \u201cemergency certificate,\u201d it was called. I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u201d I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years, and I was really casting about, thinking, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d My husband\u2019s view of it was, \u201cStay home. We have children, we\u2019ll have more children, you\u2019ll love this.\u201d And I was very restless about it.\n\nFast-forward to the most recent Democratic debate and this was her version of how she lost her job:\n\nAnd I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had 4- to 6-year-olds. But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me \u2014 wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\n\nThe one thing neither Bier nor anyone else could nail down was corroboration. Was Warren 2007 telling the truth when she said she chose to stop teaching or was Warren 2019 telling the truth when she claimed that the chauvinist principal sent her packing after finding out she was pregnant? The Beacon\u2019s scoop provides that corroboration. They offered her a contract. She quit. At some point between 2007 and 2019, which is coincidentally also the period when she became a politician, a senator, and a leading presidential candidate, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \u201cmemory\u201d of her employment history not only faded but faded in a way that enabled her to tell a too-perfect relatable story about her tribulations as a working woman in a less enlightened age.\n\nTo put all of this another way: Joe Biden\u2019s ridiculous story of confronting the dreaded gangster \u201cCorn Pop\u201d at the local swimming pool in the early 1960s appears to be substantially more accurate than Elizabeth Warren\u2019s story about how she lost her teaching job. When do we start seeing some stories about Warren\u2019s creeping dementia?\n\nA fib about her background normally wouldn\u2019t be a huge deal but this is at least the second wholly gratuitous biographical lie she\u2019s been caught in. Wait, scratch that. I mean at least the third:\n\nDetail from 2012 profile of Warren when she first ran for Senate: \"Her colorful anecdotes, though, may take some liberties.\" https://t.co/5xmACrwI8d pic.twitter.com/x2QYs71nqh \u2014 David Rutz (@DavidRutz) October 7, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s part of a pattern. And it defies belief that Warren\u2019s memory somehow got hazy when she\u2019s on camera as recently as 2007 telling the true story of how she left her job. It\u2019s clearly a deliberate lie to enhance her appeal to women. I wonder if she\u2019s going to end up trying to manage this the way she tried to manage the Cherokee DNA fiasco, by insisting that she\u2019s telling the truth no matter how bad the evidence looks for her. Maybe she\u2019ll claim that, yes, it\u2019s true that the school board offered her a new contract, but she was fired two months later once the principal realized she was pregnant and the school board played it off as a \u201cresignation\u201d for the record to save face. Although, even if she makes that move, we\u2019ll still be left with the conundrum of why Elizabeth Warren 2007 was telling people otherwise.\n\nIt\u2019ll be fascinating to see how much grief she gets for this. The media is reluctant to attack her, partly because she\u2019s the ideal of what a well-educated left-leaning journalist wants in a president (a woman, wonky, from academia) and partly because attacking her on a biographical point risks buttressing Trump\u2019s \u201cFauxcahontas\u201d attack line that she\u2019s a phony. The other Democratic candidates haven\u2019t come after her yet either. Bernie seems disinclined even though his fanatic fans aren\u2019t. Biden logically will want to focus on policy disputes, emphasizing that she\u2019s too radical. Maybe Kamala Harris will come after her at the next debate to try to claw back some votes she\u2019s lost to Warren? Or maybe the wild card, Tulsi Gabbard, will do it. She\u2019s dinged Warren before on other grounds. She has nothing to lose.", "description": "Uh oh.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
