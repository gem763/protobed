The outlets represent the attributed portion of Russia\u2019s global propaganda effort, and frequently push disinformation helpful to the Kremlin.\n\nFacebook appeared to escalate tensions Thursday when it hit Simonyan\u2019s personal account with a three-day suspension over the content of one of her posts\u2014the company won\u2019t say which post. The move appeared to be part of a broad crackdown. The same day Facebook unveiled a new \u201cpreamble\u201d to its lengthy rulebook setting out what you can and can\u2019t do on the platform, and took action against a number of other accounts, including a chatbot operated for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSputnik and RT spent much of Thursday blasting Facebook and touting their leader\u2019s suspension as an example of Western technology companies holding unchecked and arbitrary censorship power over Russian social media users. \u201cWe are living in a country where American censorship is practiced freely and with no barriers,\u201d Simonyan said in one story on Sputnik.\n\nThis time, Sputnik wasn\u2019t just making it up. Facebook said Friday that it has now restored Simonyan\u2019s account.", "description": "The social network is looking to stamp down on offensive posts and their peddlers.
