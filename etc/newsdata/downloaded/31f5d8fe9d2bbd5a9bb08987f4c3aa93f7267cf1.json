It\u2019s this one:\n\nIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2019\n\nAt the time, the National Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham office quickly made clear that there was no significant threat to Alabama. Hurricane Dorian was already expected to shift northward, taking its destructive winds to states on the southeastern coast of the United States.\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nYou can probably see the problem here: The NWS\u2019s statement conflicts directly with Trump\u2019s. When ABC News pointed that out, Trump was incensed, tweeting Tuesday an excoriation of the network and then spending the next three days sporadically insisting his tweet was correct. After personally altering a NOAA map of Dorian\u2019s projected path during a meeting with reporters Wednesday, Trump on Thursday shifted his assertions to claim that he had been talking only about wind speeds.\n\nIt was that claim that the NOAA\u2019s late-Friday statement addressed.\n\n\u201cFrom Wednesday, August 28, through Monday, September 2, the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama,\u201d the statement read. It linked to the organization\u2019s collection of projected wind-speed maps.\n\nIt then threw the NWS under the bus, saying the \u201cBirmingham National Weather Service\u2019s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cprobabilities\u201d is important here. The image below is taken from the collection suggested in the anonymous NOAA spokesman\u2019s statement. It was the most up-to-date wind-speed map available at the time of Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that there is, indeed, some overlap between the green part of the chart and the state of Alabama. If you look closely, though, you\u2019ll further notice what that green bar indicates: a 5 to 10 percent chance of tropical-storm-force winds, not hurricane ones. Tropical-storm-force winds are slower and less dangerous than hurricane-force winds; at 40 miles an hour, the lowest end, winds might be enough to snap branches off trees.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this map was a five-day projection. The three-day projection looked like this:\n\nThree-day projections are more accurate, since they don\u2019t look as far forward. As you can see, there was no projected overlap with Alabama three days out.\n\nAdmittedly speaking with some subjectivity, a 1-in-10 chance (at the upper end!) of a strong breeze affecting the southeastern corner of the state within the next five days does not seem as though it warrants being described as Alabama being \u201cmost likely \u2026 hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d from \u201cone of the largest hurricanes ever.\u201d\n\nNotice how carefully worded the NOAA statement is. It notes that its data \u201cdemonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama,\u201d a phrasing that is both accurate and almost certainly intentionally deceptive. Yes, tropical-storm-force winds could impact Alabama, as they could a number of other states. And, yes, the NWS tweet said there would be no impacts from Dorian \u2014 failing to warn Alabamians that in less than a week, there were the same odds of a breeze stiff enough to snap some tree branches as there were of randomly guessing a number between one and 10.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it is not the media that continues to rehash this issue. It was effectively dormant until Trump marked up that NOAA map Wednesday; it was fading Friday until the NOAA\u2019s statement.\n\nBut that statement is an important development, one that should not be underestimated. It is an ostensibly scientific organization \u2014 one that prides itself on providing accurate, validated information to the public \u2014 releasing a statement obviously meant to bolster Trump\u2019s defense of his tweet. It is a slightly more sophisticated version of Trump\u2019s marker map, taking a product generated through deliberate scientific processes and presenting it misleadingly to save face.\n\nThere\u2019s an important difference here, though: It seems pretty obvious that Trump or someone at the White House enticed an objective organization to make that change itself.\n\nWe\u2019ve been over the psychology and the politics of Trump\u2019s focus on Alabama already this week, but this development is something different. It\u2019s not just Trump who\u2019s trying to mislead the country. It\u2019s an organization whose mission is specifically the opposite of that doing so. It\u2019s an organization created to offer unvarnished information to the public offering information that\u2019s something less than that \u2014 for no other obvious reason than pleasing the president.\n\nAnd that elevates this entire, goofy debate to something else entirely.", "description": "Specifically: His insistence that his tweet about Hurricane Dorian and Alabama was correct.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oMb64eHrjZLdtgDRYbNWTbJtVt0=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-04-2019/t_9b46a51260f3450bbe5aaa8435438a58_name_f7ac125e_cf35_11e9_a620_0a91656d7db6_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
