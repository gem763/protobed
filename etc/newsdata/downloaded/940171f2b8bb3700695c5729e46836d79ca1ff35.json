The timeframe is definitely wrong, as WaPo reports, though the recent realities of drug pricing are more nuanced.\n\nPrices for generics are falling, which brings down the average cost of drugs overall. Prices for commonly used drugs, including generics, fell in 2018, according to a White House report.\n\nBut that average masks steady increases in the price of drugs that treat rarer diseases, which don't have generic competition.\n\nBrand-name drugs' prices increased by only 0.3% in 2018, per IQVIA, although per-capita spending on specialty drugs increased by 5.8%.\n\nOn defense \u2014 attacking Democrats over \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 Trump is also making some dubious claims.\n\n\"Almost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government healthcare takeover that would totally obliterate Medicare.... They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism,\" he said last week.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" bill would indeed replace traditional Medicare, but seniors' health care benefits would get more generous under that plan, as written \u2014 not less. However, critics of the plan say it would likely reduce seniors' access to care.\n\nAnd though it's true that Sanders' bill would eliminate private health insurance, other plans would retain it as an option.\n\nThe other side: \"Democrats, apparently unsatisfied with lying about healthcare once when they introduced Obamacare, have now introduced sweeping proposals, such as Medicare-for-All. These radical and dangerous policies would take away the insurance Americans know and trust while raising taxes and reducing choice,\" White House spokesman Judd Deere said.\n\nYes, but: There's still a lot of time left before 2020, particularly for Trump to do something major on drug prices.\n\nThe administration's proposal to tie Medicare's payments for some drugs to the prices that other countries pay is still in play, and both the White House and House Democrats have said they're hopeful that there's still a drug-pricing deal to be made.\n\nGo deeper: Trump still doesn't have an alternative to \"Medicare for All\"", "description": "The president's claims aren't always true.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/9hZ7Tsgczyy45ENZRzrISTL8jos=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570745704262.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
