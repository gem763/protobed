Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe service, called Quest Lab Stewardship, is embedded into health systems' electronic health record (EHR) systems to combine data from disparate hospitals' records. For example, the service can decipher whether a patient has already received a certain test \u2014 information that can be buried within an EHR \u2014 with the goal of cutting out unnecessary testing.\n\nHere's what hospitals stand to gain from leveraging an AI approach to running lab tests:\n\nClamping down on the volume of unnecessary tests ordered could reduce spending. An AI system can comb through health records to give doctors a more comprehensive picture of what tests need to be run and warn them if a patient has already received a test, which can help health systems stave off their share of the $200 billion the US wastes on unnecessary tests each year. And as value-based care gains prevalence, health systems should expect to be on the hook for a larger portion of these costs.\n\nCutting out unneeded tests can also help speed up doctors' operations. While many hospitals have put \"test utilization management\" programs in place to cut down on the number of lab tests ordered, many of these systems require data to be uploaded manually. However, Quest Lab Stewardship cuts out the middleman and leverages machine learning to organize and analyze lab data automatically. Because doctors order lab tests for most patient cases \u2014 98% of patients in inpatient care require at least one lab test \u2014 it's likely overburdened doctors would welcome a solution that trims down the amount of time they spend in each patient's health record.\n\nWhile Quest Lab Stewardship could have the lab-testing titan losing cash in the near-term by minimizing the number of tests its clients order \u2014 here's why it'll likely pay off in the long run. At first blush, Quest's service will have its clients ordering fewer tests, which should mean less business and up-front cash for the lab testing provider. But it's likely that providing hospitals with solutions that could slash costs will override the dollars and cents that Quest is losing with doctors ordering fewer tests as it'll become a more attractive provider to health systems.\n\nFurther, while Quest has a tight hold in the medical lab market \u2014 it controlled 15% of the $53 billion industry in 2018, just below LabCorp's 22% share \u2014 it could be up against weary clients: Following a major data breach in June 2019 that exposed up to 20 million Quest and LabCorp consumers' data, 17% of hospital execs said they might outsource lab services to providers other than LabCorp or Quest, compared to April of this year when no hospital execs were considering working with labs besides the duopoly. We could see Quest continue to roll out new services, like its done with Stewardship, in light of these scandals to better appeal to hospitals.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
