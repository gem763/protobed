Wayne Johnson was appointed chief operating officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid in 2017 by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Johnson remained in his position for seven months, during which time he oversaw $1.5 trillion in student loans, before becoming chief strategy and transformation officer for the agency.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for us to end and stop the insanity,\u201d Johnson said, asserting the federal student loan system was essentially broken.\n\n\u201cWe run through the process of putting this debt burden on somebody,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it rides on their credit files\u2014it rides on their back\u2014for decades.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who describes himself as a moderate Republican, is planning to run for Senate to replace Senator Johnny Isakson (R., Ga.).\n\nJohnson advocates forgiving up to $50,000 for anyone with federal student debt, which would immediately cancel the debt of 37 million borrowers. To pay for the plan, he proposes a one percent tax on corporate earnings.\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan would cancel more student debt than the proposal put forth by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) as part of her presidential campaign. Senator Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.) has vowed to eliminate student debt for all borrowers in the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, DeVos criticized Democrats\u2019 loan-forgiveness proposals in an interview last week on Fox News.\n\n\u201cTheir proposals are crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cWho do they think is actually going to pay for these? It\u2019s going to be two of the three Americans that aren\u2019t going to college paying for the one out of three that do.\u201d", "description": "\"The time has come for us to end and stop the insanity,\" Johnson said, asserting the federal student loan system was essentially broken.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
