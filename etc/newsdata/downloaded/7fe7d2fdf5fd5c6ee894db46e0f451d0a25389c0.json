The statement said two separate explosions were \"probably caused by missile strikes.\"\n\n\"All the ship's crew are safe and the ship is stable too,\" said NITC, according to AFP's report, which said news of the apparent attack drove prices for Brent crude oil up more than two percent on international markets.\n\nA 2006 file photo shows the Iranian oil tanker Sabiti in the Suez Canal.

Patrick Lawson / MarineTraffic.com\n\nIranian state television said the explosions damaged two storerooms aboard the tanker and caused oil to leak into the Red Sea near the Saudi port city of Jiddah, though the state-run Iranian media later said the leak had been brought under controlled.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the Sabiti last turned on its tracking devices in August near the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas.\n\nLt. Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet overseeing the Mideast, said authorities there were \"aware of reports of this incident,\" but declined to comment further.\n\nTrump criticizes Iran at United Nations\n\nThe reported attack comes after a series of attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, in recent months. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have blamed those attacks on Iran, but Tehran has denied any involvement.\n\nFriday's incident could push tensions between Iran and the U.S. even higher, more than a year after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions now crushing Iran's economy.\n\nThe mysterious attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone and other incidents across the wider Middle East followed Mr. Trump's decision.\n\nU.S. to increase military presence in Saudi Arabia, UAE\n\nThe latest assault saw Saudi Arabia's vital oil industry come under a drone-and-cruise-missile attack, halving the kingdom's output. The U.S., Saudi Arabia and several European nations have blamed Iran for the attack.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels, whom Saudi Arabia is fighting in a yearslong war, claimed that assault, though analysts say the missiles used in the attack wouldn't have the range to reach the sites from Yemen.", "description": "Iranian state-owned tanker company says two separate explosions were \"probably caused by missile strikes\" off Saudi port of Jiddah", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/11/8cce20d9-0de9-4f47-9595-9f1bc02a860f/thumbnail/1200x630/2664e098f67a08c3945007a3102d9623/iran-sabiti-tanker-nitc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
