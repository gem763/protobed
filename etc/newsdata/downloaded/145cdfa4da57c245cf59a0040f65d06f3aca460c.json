Is there anything out there that can help me tackle my sagging jowls and restore my once smooth jawline?\n\nA: I\u2019m not going to lie: only a facelift can get rid of jowls. Expensive non-invasive treatments can improve them markedly but not make them vanish.\n\nThe cheapest thing you can do is commit to using a facial tool that will drain lymph fluids and stimulate nutrient flow \u2014this will cause mild temporary tightening and, over time, stronger, plumper skin with more definition.\n\nA 61-year-old reader asked how to best treat their sagging jowls and restore a smoother jawline (file image)\n\nCompare it to daily body-brushing, which is the best self-treatment for better-toned body skin with less cellulite.\n\nThe Jillian Dempsey Gold Sculpting Bar (\u00a3185, cultbeauty.co.uk) is a handheld, fast-vibrating metal bar that you stroke along parts of the face for a visible lift and glow.\n\nThe NuFace Mini Facial Toning Device (\u00a3167, currentbody.com) emits microcurrents to tighten facial muscles for an (often very quick, though temporary) lifted effect.\n\nBoth are actually very pleasant to use and a bit addictive, which is just what you need to get you using them each and every day to see long-term results!\n\nIt\u2019s not a miracle cure but a worth-it investment in better skin and some lovely self-care.\n\nBeauty director Inge van Lotringen (pictured) advised the reader to use a facial tool that will drain lymph fluids and stimulate nutrient flow\n\nIngeborg van Lotringen is beauty director at Cosmopolitan.
