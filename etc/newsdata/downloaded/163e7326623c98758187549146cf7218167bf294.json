Each Friday, The Verge\u2019s Cut the Crap column simplifies the choice by sorting through the overwhelming multitude of movies and TV shows on subscription services and recommending a single perfect thing to watch this weekend.\n\nWhat to watch\n\n\u201cJoker\u2019s Favor,\u201d a 1992 episode of Batman: The Animated Series. Ed Begley, Jr. provides the voice of Charlie Collins, a harried Gotham resident whose road rage gets him into huge trouble when the driver he\u2019s cursing at turns out to be Batman\u2019s archnemesis, the Joker. After pleading for his life, Charlie is let off the hook, provided he promises to answer the call whenever the Joker needs a hand. When Charlie realizes this \u201cfavor\u201d might involve helping the supervillain kill Commissioner Gordon and a room full of cops, he tries to figure out how to warn Batman \u2014 and how to convince the Caped Crusader he\u2019s just a patsy.\n\nWhy watch now?\n\nBecause Joker opens wide in theaters this weekend.\n\nEagerly anticipated by action-adventure devotees who like their movies grim and gritty, this R-rated addition to the DC Comics cinematic oeuvre stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a soft-spoken wannabe comedian and clown-for-hire who endures a miserable life of poverty and abuse in a decaying Gotham City neighborhood. When Arthur is pushed into an act of violence while on his way back from a gig, his rage \u2014 and his makeup \u2014 inspires an anarchic anti-authoritarian movement in the city. The film follows this accidental antihero as he grows into his role as a criminal cult leader.\n\nJoker borrows liberally from the work of Martin Scorsese \u2014 specifically Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy \u2014 as well as Fight Club and Breaking Bad. It\u2019s a slow-paced, often punishing film, with a bleak take on human nature, which is unusual for what\u2019s ostensibly a Batman picture (minus Batman).\n\nBut it isn\u2019t unprecedented. Phoenix, writer-director Todd Phillips, and co-writer Scott Silver are shadowing Christopher Nolan\u2019s version of the Joker from the movie The Dark Knight, as played by Heath Ledger. They\u2019re also attempting something similar to what writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland did in the horrifying graphic novella The Killing Joke. The latter book has been adapted into a 2016 animated film \u2014 R-rated as well \u2014 by some of the Batman: The Animated Series creative team. The Killing Joke movie features the voices from the 1990s cartoon: Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker.\n\nHamill\u2019s Joker may be the best of any of the screen versions of the Joker. In \u201cJoker\u2019s Favor,\u201d for example, he plays the villain as simultaneously unhinged and creepily aware. He stalks Charlie Collins for years after their initial encounter, then bullies him into doing his will. He\u2019s debonair and overbearing \u2014 the kind of man everyone wants to avoid at a party. Because The Animated Series was aimed at a younger audience, this Joker isn\u2019t as scarred or scary as Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s versions. But he isn\u2019t cute and harmless, either. Hamill gives the character a sense of panache, but he doesn\u2019t spare the menace.\n\nWho it\u2019s for\n\nBat-fanatics and animation connoisseurs.\n\n\u201cJoker\u2019s Favor\u201d is one of Batman: The Animated Series\u2019 better-known episodes because it introduced Harley Quinn (voiced by Arleen Sorkin), the Joker\u2019s sassy partner in crime and occasional girlfriend who went on to become a fan-favorite character in further cartoons, comics, and movies. This episode is also a fine illustration of why this show is so beloved among superhero buffs. Director Boyd Kirkland and writer Paul Dini \u2014 working with designers / animators Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski, among many other attentive creators \u2014 strike a fine balance between a kid-friendly tone and a style that resembles classic film noir, inspired in part by Tim Burton\u2019s more gothic Batman movies.\n\nAlso, in contrast to today\u2019s superhero TV shows (and cinema and graphic novels, for that matter), \u201cJoker\u2019s Favor\u201d is a concise, unified piece of storytelling, making no demands that viewers watch 50 episodes or read a decade\u2019s worth of comics to understand what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s as cleverly plotted as a Silver Age comic book from the days when nearly every individual issue could stand alone. One sequence where Charlie rigs up a kind of bat-signal using whatever props he can find is like something out of the late 1950s DC Comics, where stories were focused on heroes thinking their way through problems and relying on their schooling.\n\nBut there\u2019s an emphasis on character here, too. The episode defines the Joker by the man he annoys. To Batman, the Joker is a deadly scourge. To Charlie, he\u2019s a nagging inconvenience. In a way, Charlie\u2019s problem is more relatable.\n\nWhere to see it\n\nDC Universe.
