Eventually you need to be among people again. That\u2019s why I head to the movie theater at weird hours, seeking some semblance of ceremony. One ticket buys the ability to be privately public. Without companions nearby, the conversation becomes visual: I glance at the whispers and flirtations in the audience, at those people leaving early, the ones staying serenely behind. I listen to the crickety rustle of popcorn. I run my fingers over oxblood velvet. Whether you\u2019re in church or in a theater, sometimes the frescoes are prettier than the liturgy.\n\nI don\u2019t buy into the rather precious notion of cinema as ritual, at least not the solemn kind. A laptop or a smartphone has its uses, and its charms. I\u2019m just too distractible to relax in front of a computer screen by myself \u2014 it always feels like research. The piety of moviegoing is ahistoric, anyway. Orson Welles once described how it was in the 1930s: \u201cYou strolled down the street and sallied into the theater at any hour of the day or night. Like you\u2019d go in to have a drink at a bar. Every movie theater was partially empty. We never asked what time the movie began.\u201d You\u2019d leave when you realized the reels had wound back to the point at which you entered. As late as 1960, Hitchcock could use \u201cno latecomers\u201d as a novel marketing gimmick for \u201cPsycho.\u201d\n\nThe studios have since become mere adornments of multinational conglomerates, producing films merged into \u201ccinematic universes,\u201d and the theaters have consolidated, too. They are fewer but more elaborate. And to counter the routine of streaming something or other whenever, both multiplexes and art houses increasingly frame every screening as an exclusive occasion. \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d sold $100 million in advance tickets, more than all but a couple of dozen films grossed over their entire domestic runs last year. Manhattan\u2019s new Metrograph is a distant corner of the industry, where you can see beautiful restorations of Dorothy Arzner pictures from an assigned seat, and they sell every ticket that way. Such convenient hassles will never feel quite like sidling spontaneously into a cinema alone, the moth circling the marquee\u2019s light.", "description": "Now playing at the multiplex: Me.
