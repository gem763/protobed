At the end of this spot, he covered his face with a Hong Kong protester-style mask and said, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!\u201d Afterward, the interviewers hid under the table briefly, and the stream cut to a commercial break.\n\nOnly a few hours after the event, Blizzard, Hearthstone\u2019s publisher, issued a statement saying, \u201cWhile we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.\u201d\n\nBlizzard is withholding any prize money Blitzchung would have earned and has banned him from competing in any tournaments for one year, effective on October 5th. The company also terminated contracts with the two casters conducting Sunday\u2019s interview.\n\nBlizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge.\n\nSenators aren\u2019t the only people upset with Blizzard\u2019s decision.
