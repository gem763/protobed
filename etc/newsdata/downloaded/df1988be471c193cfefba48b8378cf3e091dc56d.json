If you\u2019re one of the early adopters who leapt onto the Apple Arcade train as soon as it launched, here\u2019s a friendly reminder that you might want to cancel before your credit card gets charged.\n\nApple Arcade launched September 19 with a free one-month trial. And so far, the response has been fairly positive. Not only did the service launch with 100 titles, it\u2019s free of the microtransactions and ads that can ma, ke mobile gaming so frustrating.\n\nOverall, in the short time Apple Arcade has been available, Gizmodo is a fan of the service \u2014 as is our sister site Kotaku, which characterised it as \u201cmobile gaming without all the bullshit.\u201d (For what it\u2019s worth, after pondering whether to shell out after the free trial, Kotaku\u2019s Mike Fahey decided Apple Arcade is worth the $7.99.)\n\nThat said, we get it. The avalanche of content and endless subscription wars are tiring.\n\nThere\u2019s probably at least ten shows, podcasts, books, albums and other video games piling up and collecting dust in your queue. Maybe, even if you like Apple Arcade overall, you just can\u2019t justify the extra $7.99 on a service that\u2019ll mostly be relegated to your train commute. If that\u2019s the case, this is your chance to cancel before you pay a dime.", "description": "We\u2019ve all been there \u2014 sign up for a free trial, and then get dinged with a pesky automatic subscription renewal.
