Although Mr Macron and Mr Rinne do not speak for the whole EU, the deadline has weight given Finland holds the rotating presidency \u2013 which is charged with coordinating the views of member states.\n\nOfficials in Brussels are concerned the prime minister is wasting their time and playing out talks for as long as possible without presenting proposals \u2013 possibly with an eye on an upcoming election.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s chief negotiator Mr Barnier told the European parliament earlier in the day: \u201cAlmost three years after the UK referendum, I don\u2019t think we should be spending time pretending to negotiate. I think we need to move forward with determination.\u201d\n\nEU officials told The Independent last week that they were losing patience \u2013 and that they feared they were being \u201cled up the garden path\u201d by the UK negotiators.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

UK sources have also reportedly suggested full proposals are being deliberately held back to the last minute for timing reasons.\n\nThe EU side has been briefing that Mr Johnson experienced a \u201cpenny dropping moment\u201d during his meeting with EU boss Jean-Claude Juncker earlier this week in Luxembourg.\n\nAccording to the accounts of EU officials quoted in the Financial Times, Mr Johnson appeared not to understand that his proposals for Northern Ireland to stick to EU food and livestock regulations after Brexit would not resolve the ongoing impasse over customs arrangements at the border.\n\nAn official described Mr Johnson \u201cslumping\u201d in his chair at the lunch in Luxembourg, as his Brussels counterparts said that the plan for common \u201csanitary and phytosanitary\u201d (SPS) rules on the island of Ireland would not do away with the need for customs checks on the vast majority of goods crossing the border.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, one official said the PM turned to chief negotiator David Frost and Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay and said: \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me the SPS plan doesn\u2019t solve the customs problem?\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same European parliament debate on Wednesday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said of a meeting with Mr Johnson in Luxembourg on Monday: \u201cI said to Prime Minister Johnson that I have no emotional attachment to the backstop but I stand by the objectives it\u2019s designed to achieve. I called on the PM to come forward with operational proposals in writing for practical steps which would allow us to achieve those objectives.\u201d\n\nAlthough it has not presented full proposals, the UK has come forward with one idea: a theoretical veto for Northern Ireland on any backstop replacement. This plan was, however, dismissed by parliament Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt on Wednesday as \u201ca permanent instrument for blackmailing\u201d the EU during negotiations.\n\nMEPs in the European parliament on Wednesday afternoon approved a resolution that says they support an extension of Article 50 to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Independent understands that there was controversy on the parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group over whether the resolution should include \u201cpreventing a no deal\u201d as one of the possible justifications for an Article 50 extension. Some MEPs on the group \u2013 thought to be close to Emmanuel Macron \u2013 attempted to have the justification removed, leaving only a general election and second referendum as reasons for a further delay. A source said the thinking behind the attempt to remove the line was that it undermined the EU negotiating position.\n\nThe attempt failed \u2013 meaning the parliament supports an extension in virtually all circumstances to stop the UK crashing out. While the parliament\u2019s position on an extension is purely symbolic, because the question of one is down to EU leaders on the council, the episode highlights the existence of divisions on the EU side over the question of further delays.\n\nBut despite the setback in the parliament, those looking for a tougher line on the UK appear to be making headway with member states. Addressing the issue of whether an extension would be granted, Finnish prime minister Mr Rinnie said: \u201cSomething must happen that extra time can be granted. If there is no genuine new solution in sight, there is no prerequisite for granting additional time.\u201d\n\nThe new deadline set by the leaders complicates efforts to avoid a no-deal Brexit; parliament has legislated to force Mr Johnson to demand an extension of Article 50 if no deal has been signed by 19 October \u2013 the day after the next meeting of the European Council.\n\nMr Johnson spent the afternoon calling around EU leaders. A Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201cThis afternoon the prime minister spoke to European Commission President Juncker, European parliament President Sassoli, Cypriot President Anastasiades, and Latvian Prime Minister Karins.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister and President Juncker discussed the positive and constructive conversation they had in Luxembourg on Monday, and their shared determination to reach a deal.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister updated the other European leaders on the progress of the Brexit talks to date and reiterated that, when the UK leaves the EU on October 31, his preference is that we do so with a deal. He spoke about the work that was under way to find an alternative to the backstop that protects both the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement and the integrity of the single market.\u201d", "description": "EU leaders have given Boris Johnson an ultimatum to come up with a new Brexit plan by the end of September\u00a0or face up to a no deal.
