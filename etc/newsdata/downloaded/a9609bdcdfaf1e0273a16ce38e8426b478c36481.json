Amish people tend to align strongly on policy with Republicans, who share their opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. But making voters out of the Amish, who forgo technology like television and the Internet and who believe fiercely in the separation of their religious community from government intrusion, may be a steep goal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn a farm where eight Amish children in their traditional clothing were playing baseball, a young woman said sternly of those who would ask the Amish to vote: \u201cWe don\u2019t really appreciate that.\u201d\n\nWhile she skillfully snapped lima bean pods off the bushes at her farm, another woman said about voting: \u201cMy husband never did; I never did.\u201d\n\nThe same answer at market stall after market stall, where Amish farmers sell their wares: Never voted. Never wanted to vote.\n\nBut Ben Walters, who co-founded Amish PAC, says the tide is turning. He heard from more Amish people willing to vote in 2018 than in 2016; in 2020, he thinks, the numbers will be still higher. \u201cTheir votes would be so important, and there\u2019s a lot of them,\u201d he said. \u201cSince 2016, every single year, it gets a little bit easier. We\u2019re seeing more and more signs of progress. I think behaviors are finally changing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWalters lives in the Washington area and is not Amish, though he was familiar with the sect \u2014 a Christian community which settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th century and has protected its farming-based, technology-minimizing way of life ever since. His grandparents had Amish friends in Indiana, he says, who used to invite him for meals.\n\nThat was enough to spark his curiosity about the sect\u2019s voting behavior. After working on a PAC supporting Ben Carson\u2019s 2016 run for president, Walters teamed up with barn-building company owner Ben King \u2014 who grew up Amish and left the faith \u2014 to make the Amish and their local religious cousins, the conservative Mennonite denominations, their new political project.\n\nAt Elizabethtown College in Lancaster County, Kyle Kopko and Steven Nolt \u2014 two of the foremost experts on the Amish \u2014 are studying the results of the PAC\u2019s efforts. Nolt said he is skeptical the PAC can make much of a dent. \u201cFor a group like the Amish PAC, the key is \u2014 to what extent could a group like Amish PAC take that civic identity that\u2019s here, and leverage that into registering to vote and actually voting?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a prohibition, [but] there would be a fairly strong, strong religious and cultural bias against [voting.]\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFocusing on Lancaster County, where more than 10 percent of America\u2019s 300,000-plus Amish citizens live, the two researchers found that 1,019 Amish people cast votes in the county in 2016, out of 15,055 eligible voters. That is not a lot, although in the late 1990s, fewer than 450 of the Amish were even registered to vote.\n\nThe Amish have been in the United States for hundreds of years but speak a German dialect to this day, and refer to outsiders as \u201cEnglish.\u201d They still dress much as they did when they arrived in this country. They avoid government intrusion in many forms \u2014 by withdrawing their children from school and putting them to work in family businesses after eighth grade; by seeking waivers, unusual among almost any other American group, to exempt themselves from participation in Social Security.\n\nVoting makes many apprehensive, just as it does in some traditional Mennonite communities in the region.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t. It\u2019s just something we don\u2019t do. It\u2019s just something that isn\u2019t practiced among our people \u2014 they feel like we as Christians are looking forward to going to heaven someday, and we don\u2019t vote,\u201d Janice Lehman said as she worked at a produce stall in a Lancaster County farm market.\n\nLehman is a member of one of Lancaster County\u2019s many Mennonite sects, a Christian tradition which shares roots with the Amish but varies more widely in level of integration with the outside world. Mennonites are much more likely to get news about politics from TV, radio and the Internet, all technologies which the Amish don\u2019t use. Some Mennonites are very politically involved (one pastor\u2019s wife even ran for Congress last year, as a Democrat). Others, like Lehman, belong to more traditional orders which emphasize communal values, old-fashioned dress and disengagement from the earthly realm.\n\nAmish PAC hopes to reach those conservative Mennonite voters as well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYvonne Beiler, a Mennonite farm owner, said she had heard about the voter-registration push and she wasn\u2019t interested. \u201cWe don\u2019t vote, and we just try to pray for our leaders,\u201d she said as her cows mooed loudly and one of her six children called out to her as he tinkered with a wrench. (Young enough to still have training wheels on his bike, the boy is already able to adjust the wheels himself.)\n\n\u201cI guess we just feel like it\u2019s not for us to vote. That would be our belief, I guess,\u201d Beiler said. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure. We just don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nBut George W. Bush, who was president from 2001 to 2009, changed that perception for some in Lancaster County.\n\nAD\n\nBush and his father, George H.W. Bush, were the only two sitting presidents who came to speak to Amish citizens, Nolt says. The younger Bush already had goodwill built up by his father in the community, and he campaigned hard in Pennsylvania. His frequent talk of Christian values, his identification with rural America and his opposition to abortion and to same-sex marriage all appealed to the Amish.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2004, 1,342 Amish people in Lancaster County alone came out to vote for him.\n\nTrump is nowhere near as popular among the Amish. So the fact that Amish voting even approached that peak in 2016 indicates Amish PAC\u2019s efforts might be working, Kopko and Nolt said.\n\nAD\n\nThe PAC, which spent nearly $140,000 in 2016 and has raised $32,000 so far for 2020, according to campaign finance records, mostly focuses on advertising in heavily Amish areas of Pennsylvania and Ohio. In 2016, their \u201cVOTE TRUMP\u201d billboards showed a picture of an Amish buggy with the words, \u201cHard Working, Pro-Life, Family Dedicated . . . Just Like YOU.\u201d\n\nThe group is already paying for newspaper advertisements to encourage prospective 2020 voters to register now, and will put the billboards back up in 2020.\n\nAs a rule, Amish church members don\u2019t have driver\u2019s licenses. But in addition to getting around by the trademark gray buggies that Lancaster\u2019s roads are famous for, and by the two-wheeled, no-pedal, bicycle-like scooter that the Amish prefer, many are willing to ride in cars, just not drive them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo on Election Day in 2016, Amish PAC mobilized voters to ring every Amish doorbell they knew of in Lancaster County, offering rides to the polls. Walters says more than 200 non-Amish Republican volunteers helped out.\n\nThey hit their jackpot at an Amish wedding \u2014 all Amish weddings take place on weekdays in late fall, when the harvest schedule allows enough time for it \u2014 where they drove numerous wedding guests to go vote.\n\nWalters says he is confident that if the Amish do vote, they will vote for Trump. \u201cThey can relate to a businessman who runs a family business with his kids. I think they appreciate the fact that he abstains from alcohol and drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nHis fundraising messages, which drum up donations from Republicans across the country willing to invest in the Amish vote, mock Democrats and use favorite Fox News catchphrases. When he talks to Amish would-be voters, he takes a different tone. \u201cThe Amish care about religious liberty, business regulation, abortion and judges. Those are four things that the Amish overwhelmingly support President Trump over whoever the Democratic candidate is. We talk a lot more about issues than we do about candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nKopko and Nolt found that 90 percent of Amish who do register do so as Republicans. Less than 1 percent register as Democrats.\n\nAt Root\u2019s Country Market, a jumble of rural Pennsylvania cultures collide every Tuesday. It\u2019s the sort of place where a traditionally dressed Amish woman selling dairy products sets up shop right next to a secular stand that makes lewd, winking references on hats and T-shirts to town names in the area: \u201cIntercourse, Pa. Between Blue Ball and Paradise.\u201d\n\nIn the market\u2019s sprawling buildings and rows of outdoor stands, auctioneers will sell anything, even a few boxes of Kraft macaroni and cheese, to the highest bidder. Merchants who may be Amish, Mennonite or \u201cEnglish\u201d peddle jambalaya, wine, hemp oil, five different editions of \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d reams of VHS and cassette tapes and paperback romance novels and a reduced-price TV set up to play old episodes of \u201cBewitched.\u201d\n\nOthers sell Trump hats, Trump flags and Trump bobbleheads, and Confederate flag belt buckles, wallets and bandannas.\n\nOne religious woman selling flavored pretzels and pies piled high with strawberries at a market stall didn\u2019t want to discuss politics, but said when she votes, she votes \u201cto stay conservative.\u201d\n\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t appear to have gained a lot of traction in the community. Omar Stolzfus, running a pit beef stand at the bustling market, said he skipped the polls in 2016 because he was dissatisfied with both candidates. He last voted in 2004. George W. Bush was the last candidate who had \u201cChristian values that I shared,\u201d he said.\n\nMen like Stolzfus, who own businesses that bring them in contact with non-Amish neighbors often, are more likely to have political opinions than farmers who interact almost entirely with fellow Amish people. And men are much more likely to vote than Amish women: 77 percent of Amish who registered in 2016 were male, Kopko and Nolt found.\n\nPriscilla Stolzfus, who worked at the couple\u2019s dairy stall inside the market while her husband manned their beef shack outside, said she never thought of voting even when her spouse did. \u201cMaybe I feel like it\u2019s something that the husband as a leader would do, instead of myself,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s how Elizabeth Lapp, who owns a stand-alone farm stand with her husband in Lancaster, thinks about it too. She describes herself as \u201ca country wife\u201d who doesn\u2019t pay much attention to politics.\n\n\u201cI think Trump \u2014 who\u2019s Trump? He\u2019s the president, right? \u2014 he\u2019s doing pretty good. Just from what I hear people say, he\u2019s trying to improve things,\u201d she said.\n\nIke Lapp, on the other hand, is the rare Amish man with plenty of political opinions. His neighbor Bob, who is not Amish, frequently drives him from place to place. And Bob watches Fox News, and fills Lapp in on what is happening.\n\nLapp says of Trump: \u201cI think he does more of what he says than a lot of the presidents ever did. If he says it, he means it. . . .He\u2019s pretty rash, but I think that\u2019s what we need as a leader.\u201d\n\nLapp is against impeachment. (\u201cI just think it\u2019s another way for the people that don\u2019t like him to get something against him.\u201d) Though he only gets the local Lancaster newspaper and never watches TV or hears the radio, he\u2019s concerned about fake news. (\u201cSad to say, the media just wants you to hear the bad side of everybody. There has to be a good side.\u201d)", "description": "Amish PAC aims to win more votes for Trump in Pennsylvania, a state both Trump and the Democrats are desperate to win.
