We don't believe for one second that he did it,' Bill Milat, 72, one of Ivan's nine brothers, told the Daily Telegraph.\n\nThe brother claimed to have evidence which accounted for Milat's whereabouts on Boxing Day 1991, the same day German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and Anja Habscied, 20, left a hostel in Kings Cross and then vanished.\n\n'There were three cars parked behind his, he couldn't have got out that day...

I know he's innocent,' Mr Shipsey told 10Daily in May.\n\n'I know he's innocent and I know he's been framed, 100 per cent, otherwise I wouldn't stick my head out here,' he said.\n\nMilat had been taken to hospital in May to be treated for cancer of the oesophagus and stomach before later being returned to the hospital wing of the jail.\n\nThe cancer spread to his liver, lungs, bones and lymph nodes, and he developed fluid on his heart.\n\nMr Shipsey accurately predicted there would be no 11th-hour confession from Milat.\n\nMilat's nephew, Alistair Shipsey (pictured), 60, also believed Ivan was innocent and stored numerous letters sent from his uncle while locked up\n\nMilat was convicted in 1996 for the murder of seven backpackers in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney, between 1989 and 1992\n\nMilat was convicted in 1996 for the murder of seven backpackers in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney, between 1989 and 1992.\n\nHe was serving seven life sentences for the killings but always maintained his innocence and refused to confess to the other deaths that police believed he was responsible for.\n\nMilat was found guilty of the killings of English backpackers Caroline Clarke, 21, and Joanne Walters, 22, Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both 19 and German backpackers Simone Schmidl, 20, Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and Anja Habschied, 20.\n\nHe stabbed most of his victims - decapitating one whose head has never been found - and shot another 10 times in the head as if using her for target practice.", "description": "The Milats claim they have evidence which accounts for Ivan's whereabouts on Boxing Day 1991, the same day two left a hostel in Kings Cross and then vanished.", "authors": ["Thomas Duff", "Chris Lines For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/00/20230134-0-image-a-24_1572134114401.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
