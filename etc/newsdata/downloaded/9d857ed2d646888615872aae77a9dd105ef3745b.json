The officer\u2019s death marks the 10th police suicide in the city this year.\n\nPolice said that the officer was found at around 9 p.m. at his residence in the Fresh Meadows neighborhood of Queens.\n\nCommissioner James O\u2019Neill told CBS New York on Oct. 9 that more officers have died by suicide in 2019 than in recent years. There had been four or five NYPD suicides annually for the last five years. O\u2019Neill described the situation as a \u201cmental health crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for people to come forward, especially if you\u2019re in crisis. I think that\u2019s almost impossible,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThe biggest issue is getting over that hurdle\u2014 getting over that hurdle of stigma.\u201d\n\nThe rate of suicides among NYPD police officers is already higher than for other residents of New York City. The rate of suicides for uniformed NYPD personnel is 13.8 per 100,000 people (according to 2017 data) while for the city\u2019s population overall it is 6.7 per 100,000 (according to 2016 data). Some officers and experts say that on-the-job trauma and stress, combined with a culture of stigmatizing mental illness, create conditions that are dangerous to officers\u2019 mental health.\n\nAndy O\u2019Hara, a retired California Highway Patrol sergeant, wrote in a 2017 Marshall Project essay that there is a \u201ccode of secrecy\u201d surrounding police mental illness. \u201cBased on 24 years experience on the job, I believe that work-related stress and depression are far more prevalent in police work than reports suggest,\u201d O\u2019Hara wrote. \u201cLaw enforcement is one of the most toxic, caustic career fields in the world. But, while injuries like PTSD are increasingly acknowledged within the military, its prevalence in civilian police work goes virtually unnoticed.\u201d\n\nA report by New York City\u2019s Department of Investigation published in September found that the police department\u2019s internal support services are \u201cunderused\u201d by officers, and that officers often said that stigma made them reluctant to get help.\n\nA survey of 174 officers conducted by the investigators found that 44, or 25%, reported having an experience that made them consider receiving \u201cbehavioral or emotional support\u201d from a professional, but only 28 of these officers actually sought help. The most common reason why an officer considered seeking support was a \u201ctragic incident on duty.\u201d\n\nAmong other recommendations, the report said that the department should consider establishing mandatory mental health checks for all officers.\n\nThe New York City Police Department has started several new initiatives to help support the mental health of its officers over the last two years, including a new Officer Mental Health and Wellness Task Force.\n\nWrite to Tara Law at tara.law@time.com.", "description": "A 33-year-old New York City police officer died by suicide on Tuesday.
