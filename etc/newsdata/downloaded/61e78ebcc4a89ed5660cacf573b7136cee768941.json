But tonight was different \u2013 Angie Kent, god love her, copped an eyeful of two.\n\nOne was live and in the flesh courtesy of a very brave Ciarran in a life drawing class and the other was a baby photo of Timm, so not quite the sexy peen you might imagine but still, weird.\n\nAs usual, myself (Josie) and my sidekick Mel were there every step of the way and will now recap it, just for you. Enjoy.\n\nJOSIE: Mel, in yesterday\u2019s recap you predicted there would be people sipping tea and glaring sideways at Jamie in today\u2019s episode, and you were absolutely bang-on. The Boys (well mainly Timm) were NOT happy about Jamie dogging them and approaching Angie at last night\u2019s cocktail party.\n\nBut before Jamie can have a complete \u201cI\u2019M HERE FOR ANGIE NOT THE BOYS\u201d meltdown, a well-timed Tom appears from Osher\u2018s home within the walls carrying a mysterious box.\n\nMEL: How dare Tom enter Osher\u2019s lair, ever! The rudeness. The box came with a date card, with half the guys listed on it \u2013 including Jamie, who was listed last. Naturally he almost had heart failure over the possibility of not scoring time with Angie. Then the box was opened \u2013 feather boas, bridesmaid sashes, and other hen\u2019s party paraphernalia! I have to say, this was a great idea for a group date.\n\nJOSIE: Especially when the token stretch Hummer rolled up to the mansion containing none other than Yvie, Angie\u2019s BFF and Gogglebox sidekick. First Angie\u2019s bro, now her best mate \u2013 they\u2019re really choosing some good judges of character to suss out these blokes.\n\nWhen they\u2019re all piled into the car Yvie does single out Ryan as being Angie\u2019s perfect match on paper, and it\u2019s not only Jamie who begins to stare into the void over it. Bloody Carlin also looks like he wants to hijack the Hummer and drive it and Ryan off a cliff, Thelma & Louise style.\n\nMEL: And tbh, same? How shit would it be if some rando who knew the person you liked waltzed into the Bachelorette with a history and the bestie\u2019s approval? Fuck that right off this planet. So then we see Angie with Osher and some lady, and she has NFI that a) her Bachelorette party is on today and b) that Yvie\u2019s in attendance.\n\nJOSIE: Yeah and like I said to you, everyone\u2019s all \u201cOMG RYAN SUCH A THREAT\u201d but I haven\u2019t seen much evidence of that? Like he\u2019s very good-looking and likes dogs, but tbf a lot of these blokes are very good-looking and also like dogs. I don\u2019t think a few DMs are that damning. Anyway, I loved that Angie also referred to her as \u201csome lady\u201d. She truly had no idea what was going on. So the party and Yvie were genuinely great surprises for her. One thing that wasn\u2019t a surprise? Ciarran self-nominating to be the nude model in the life drawing class. Of course he did.\n\nMEL: And aren\u2019t we fucking 10000% glad he did, hoooo boy.\n\nJOSIE: I mean, we saw his butt in the first episode which was actually super out of context because it was just him talking about his skincare routine and then suddenly there\u2019s him naked in the shower? Not that I minded, but it was a little jarring. This however, THIS was most welcome. He just gets up there in front of his new mates, the girl he likes and her best friend and gets his junk out. Amazing confidence levels there.\n\nMEL: He clearly had a good dick, and even Angie says it \u2013 yes, girl. We were all thinking it. You\u2019d have to love your peen to be confident enough to whip it out, flaccid, in front of 15 dudes you\u2019re competing with and the woman you like. So he starts modelling, and Angie/Yvie aren\u2019t coping. They\u2019re giggling into their champagne like schoolgirls. Best. Group Date. Ever.\n\nJOSIE: It was incredible. I have no idea how much time passed but it felt like he was nude up the front of that room for hours. He did get a little breather though when Yvie requested a one-on-one chat with him, which he did wearing only two bunches of grapes as clothing. I need these Ciarran levels of confidence. Do you think he\u2019ll become a life coach after this show, because sign me up.\n\nMEL: SAME. Yvie was very into him, she loved his cheeky vibe and his confidence. She also chatted to Ryan, who she loved, and Carlin \u2013 who she found a bit too serious for Angie. Meanwhile, Jamie was doing whatever he could to get Angie and Yvie\u2019s attention with his Bachelorette party getup.\n\nJOSIE: Showing that he\u2019s Fun And Silly\u2122 just like Ciarran! Mate, no. You\u2019re about as fun as a pap smear tbh. He was really like stewing on the fact that Yvie didn\u2019t approach him for a chat \u2013 maybe he should have taken the initiative and spoken to her? He wasn\u2019t chained to the chair, people were moving around the room. It was weird that he just sat there.\n\nMEL: It was so weird, he just sat there looking like a zesty creep. Then after the ad break we had Angie waiting for Timm \u2013 I\u2019m SO glad this first date happened! We knew Timm would be a vibe for Angie and we weren\u2019t wrong. They have such a natural chemistry together and you can tell he genuinely makes her laugh. READ MORE Lobster Lad Timm Reportedly Felt Like He Was Gonna Faint During A 'Bachie' Rose Ceremony JOSIE: Can I just say, I have never been so invested in an office sweep before. You have Timm and I have Ciarran and my god, they\u2019re the best. They\u2019d be my faves even we didn\u2019t have them. I was super happy Timm got the single date and what was even better was it was actually like a normal date. Not a typical Bachelorette date of \u201cokay let\u2019s be hung by our ankles upside down from the tallest building in Australia and then have a cheese plate, sound okay?\u201d MEL: Yes! They just strolled around Centennial Park eating Gelato Messina, that\u2019s even more chill than dates I go on.\n\nI loved it so much, even when they sat down to the eventual cheese plate in the rain \u2013 to look at baby photos of Timm, including one where he is entirely nude. How many of the Bachelorette contestants\u2019 dicks is Angie gonna see at this point? JOSIE: Two actual cocks in this Bachelorette episode instead of people just behaving like cocks. A refreshing change! Anyway their rainy date was so cute, Timm seemed really genuine and heartfelt about relationships and finding that person you\u2019re gonna grow old with. Did I cry? Maybe (definitely). I know that Angie thinks he\u2019s a \u201cnaughty boy\u201d but I think she was surprised by him being able to talk seriously about that stuff. When she gave him a rose and then he grabbed her for a kiss I nearly slid off my damn chair. HOT HOT HOT. MEL: I was getting so flustered! We both were, there may have been some fanning of the face going on. He is so sexy, if Angie doesn\u2019t choose him as the Bachelorette winner I\u2019ll volunteer as tribute. Hell, we\u2019ll BOTH volunteer as tribute. So then it was like BAM! Cocktail party! And fuuuuuck me up, how sexual did Timm & Ciarran look. JOSIE: At one point I was like \u201cMARRY US TIMM\u201d which definitely took it into a weird polyamorous area. I couldn\u2019t help myself! And then they both looked outrageously good at that cocktail party, if I was literally any of the other guys (except maybe Carlin) I would have just backed into a bush, Homer Simpson-style, never to be seen again. What\u2019s even the point of hanging around with these two in the mix? MEL: Meanwhile, Jamie was being his usual batshit self and it was so painful to watch, you literally looked AWAY Josie. Ryan\u2019s having a chat with Angie and Jamie legit swoops in after 0.002 seconds, saying he wants to speak with BOTH of them (!!) because he wanted to get to the bottom of why Yvie thinks Ryan\u2019s such a perfect match for Angie??? What the fuck? JOSIE: It was so, so bad. Just such a cringe moment. And while some people might just politely go \u201cOkay sure\u201d, both Ryan and Angie were like\u2026 nup. So then Jamie had to kind of skulk off again and it made my entire soul hurt, Mel. Why is he like this. MEL: Just be NORMAL, fuck. Don\u2019t go up to people having a chat and say \u201cI want to analyse you and see why Yvie likes you together\u201d. What the shit is that? Anyway, thankfully we then had some minor drama with Timm swooping in after Ryan and taking some precious Angie-time away from the other dudes. It was preeetty snaky considering just last ep, he was roasting Jamie for not abiding by \u201cbro code\u201d and jostling for time with the woman. JOSIE: Like, he was literally the one who gathered The Boys around the fire pit and made the rule that there would be NO SWOOPING. And then he goes and swoops. I mean, I don\u2019t care because look at him, but the others were a bit miffed. They had an emergency fire pit meeting of The Boys just to discuss it, and it gave Jamie a new anxiety: that Timm is a \u201cnew threat\u201d. Honestly the way these Bachelorette guys talk and act it\u2019s like Survivor in suits, isn\u2019t it.\n\nMEL: YES! At least 80% of these guys are not here for Angie\u2019s heart, they just want to win/make it far enough that their ego is soothed. I feel like the women on The Bachelor are more invested in the guy, or at least better at hiding their ulterior motives. JOSIE: Totally. The Bachelorette is very much about the competition for the guys. Anyway, The Boys were right to be worried about Timm because during his and Angie\u2019s zesty little cocktail party hang, they bloody well pashed again! A secret cocktail party pash! To his credit he didn\u2019t saunter back into the party with red lipstick smeared all over his face smugly saying \u201cThat was a lot\u201d, Abbie from last season of The Bachelor-style.", "description": "Bachelorette Australia turned into an actual bachelorette party tonight, with Ciarran acting as the nude entertainment.
