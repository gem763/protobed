It's one of the best places to access old video games straight in your browser - and it just updated its collection with thousands of DOS classics! Here's how to play.\n\nThe Internet Archive is a nonprofit digital library that aims to procide universal access to all forms of knowledge. Its collections cover everything from dead websites archival microfilms to public-domain books. But the jewel in the crown is arguably its extensive database of video games. Thanks to an \"archival reproduction\" loophole, these are all free to play without breaking any copyright laws.\n\nThis week, the organisation added 2500 additional PC DOS games - including much-loved oldies like Tetris, Wizardry and The Secret Of Monkey island. There are also some slightly older games, like the PC port of the PlayStation classic Wipeout, Team 17's Ultimate Body Blows and The Need For Speed.\n\nTo play the games, simply browse the archive and click on the title you're interested in - you can then load it via software emulation directly inside your browser.\n\nIn no particular order, here are a few games to get you started:\n\nNot bad, eh? You can check out the full collection here.\n\nPersonally, I always preferred Commodore Amiga games to IBM. As luck would have it, the Internet Archive has a free collection of those too.
