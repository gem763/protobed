Mr. Pollack is convinced that the shooting would never have happened but for the ultra-woke disciplinary approach that allowed 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz to buy an AR-15: He had no criminal record, despite 45 visits by Broward County sheriff\u2019s deputies to his home.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the school district actually gave him free shooting lessons by enrolling him in JROTC, despite his \u201cemotional and behavioral disability\u201d and history of violence, sexual misconduct, threats, self-mutilation, property destruction and animal cruelty, and an obsession with firearms and killing people.\n\n\u201cThe Parkland school shooting was the most avoidable mass murder in American history,\u201d Mr. Pollack says in the introduction to \u201cWhy Meadow Died: The People and Policies that Created the Parkland Shooter and Endanger America\u2019s Students,\u201d which was released Tuesday.\n\nNikolas Cruz \u201cwas never going to be a model citizen, but it truly took a village to raise him into a school shooter,\u201d Mr. Pollack writes. \u201cI can\u2019t even say he killed my daughter. They killed my daughter.\u201d\n\nMr. Pollack teamed up with Manhattan Institute senior fellow Max Eden to write the book after the Feb. 14, 2018, massacre that left 17 students and faculty dead.\n\nTogether, they paint a damning picture of a disciplinary approach embraced by the Broward County Public Schools, modeled on policies pushed by social justice groups and federal agencies, starting with the federal Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights during the Obama administration.\n\nThe authors also describe the politics involved in trying to change the system. Those calling for accountability by the school district wound up being labeled as pro-NRA or racist for focusing on issues other than firearms, as students like David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez became national gun-control celebrities.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have had to fall to a father of a victim to find answers. But the media seemed more interested in attacking than investigating anything that wasn\u2019t about gun control,\u201d Mr. Eden said.\n\nThe district\u2019s policy of placing \u201cdisabled\u201d students like Cruz in the least restrictive academic environment resulted in him being moved in January 2016 from a special school for students with extreme behavioral problems to Stoneman Douglas, where administrators were ill-equipped to handle him.\n\nOnce there, Broward\u2019s push to help students avoid the \u201cschoolhouse-to-jailhouse pipeline\u201d by minimizing suspensions, expulsions and arrests allowed the future school shooter to skate time and again after infractions that would have gotten him kicked out or jailed in earlier decades.\n\nSurprisingly, the PROMISE program, which received enormous attention after the shooting, barely figures into the shooter\u2019s story. While Cruz was referred to the program in middle school, he never attended, and the district failed to follow up on his absence.\n\nThe authors recount example after example of the disturbing behavior of the future shooter, or \u201c18-1958,\u201d as Mr. Pollack calls him, referring to his case number, as well as a \u201cwhat if\u201d list of 42 things that could have derailed the shooting.\n\nFor example, in September 2016, Cruz attacked a boy dating Cruz\u2019s ex-girlfriend and called him the \u201cN-word.\u201d Five students told an assistant principal afterward that Cruz threatened to kill people and brought weapons to school. The school responded by giving Cruz a two-day internal suspension and banning him from bringing a backpack to school.\n\nThe other boy? He received a more serious punishment, a one-day out-of-school suspension.\n\nA month after Cruz was enrolled at Stoneman Douglas in January 2016, the Broward County sheriff\u2019s office received a call from a woman reporting an Instagram post in which he said, \u201cI am going to get this gun and shoot up the school.\u201d\n\nAccording to the book, however, the officer who responded told her he had a right to free speech, even though threatening a school shooting is a felony. The officer notified the school resource officer, and a few days later the school sent an email about a \u201cpotential threat.\u201d\n\nWhen Sheriff Scott Israel signed the PROMISE agreement, he declared \u201cwe measure our success by the kids we keep out of jail, not by the kids we put in jail.\u201d School-based arrests in Broward County dropped from 1,056 to 392 from 2012 to 2016.\n\nChange may be coming. A Broward County school board candidate seeking to reform the system lost in August 2018, but the Trump administration has put the brakes on the Obama administration\u2019s threat of civil rights investigations for schools that fail to reduce suspensions and expulsions.\n\n\u201cThe Parkland school shooting was the most avoidable mass murder in American history, and the policies that made it inevitable have been spread to schools across America,\u201d Mr. Eden said. \u201cThanks to Trump, the feds are no longer pushing them. But they aren\u2019t going anywhere unless parents wake up and take action.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
