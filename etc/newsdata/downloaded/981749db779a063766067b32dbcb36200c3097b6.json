It went big, hiring South African born actress Lesley-Ann Brandt, best known for playing an Afrikaans-speaking demon in the TV show \"Lucifer\", as the face of its offering.\n\nIn a television ad, reportedly featuring her first South African television work, Brandt urges South Africans to say \"I\" \u2013 or possible \"aye\" \u2013 to claim their posession and achievements.\n\nThat, apparently, caught the eye of a competing insurer, Old Mutual iWYZE. This week that brand launched its own video featuring \"I\", as well as visuals that very closely match those of Santam.\n\nThen Old Mutual iWYZE started to post its video as replies to Santam on Twitter.\n\nHere is the original ad by Santam, featuring Lesley-Ann Brandt:\n\nAnd here is how Old Mutual's iWYZE quickly responded on Twitter.\n\nIf you're here for @LesleyAnnBrandt say I. ?? And if you're here for insurance - #SayiWYZE! ??
