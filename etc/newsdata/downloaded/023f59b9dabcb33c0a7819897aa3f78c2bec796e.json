Cryptos crater as Congress tries to pin Zuckerberg down on \u2018too big to fail\u2019 Libra", "language": "en", "text": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plummeted as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to defend his beleaguered digital currency Libra \u2013 a project rapidly losing institutional support as it hits one regulatory hurdle after another.\n\nIf Facebook isn\u2019t allowed to go forward with the rollout of its digital currency, China will surpass the US in technological innovation, Zuckerberg threatened the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. The billionaire\u2019s bid to save Libra \u2013 and its public image \u2013 after several of the big-name financial institutions backing the online payments system dropped out saw the bottom fall out of the already-sluggish crypto market.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sit here and assume that because America is today the leader, that it will always be the leader if we don\u2019t innovate,\u201d the Facebook CEO pleaded with Congress. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do things like this\u2026 eventually, we lose our leadership.\u201d Translation: approve Libra, or the dollar gets it.\n\nBitcoin plunged to a four-month low of $7,440.51 before Zuckerberg even opened his mouth and continued to drop as he struggled to explain how Libra would drag the US financial system kicking and screaming into the 21st century. Bitcoin wasn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency affected by the billionaire\u2019s limp defense of what one congressman called \u201cZuck bucks\u201d \u2013 Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Litecoin, and other digital currencies were all down, most by more than 10 percent, as Congress piled on the social media magnate.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency either doesn\u2019t work\u2026 or it does achieve its objectives, perhaps, and displaces the US dollar or interferes with the US dollar being the sole reserve currency in the world,\u201d Rep. Brad Sherman (D-California) declared, singing the dollar\u2019s praises as he demanded of Zuckerberg how he would protect the American financial system and its users from drug dealers, terrorists, tax evaders\u2026 and his own business partners.\n\nYou\u2019re going to be making powerful burglary tools and letting your business partners commit the burglary!\n\nThe Facebook CEO had promised the company\u2019s newly-minted financial subsidiary Calibra would not begin doing business until it was cleared by US regulators, but could not guarantee Facebook\u2019s business partners would not create anonymous wallets or otherwise violate financial regulations. Even the process of nominating board members to the Libra Association, based in Switzerland, would eventually not involve Facebook, Zuckerberg admitted.\n\nFacebook\u2019s rock-bottom trust rating was a popular topic in the hearing. \u201cHave you learned that you should not lie?\u201d Rep. Nydia Velasquez (D-New York) asked after reminding Zuckerberg he had claimed WhatsApp was \u201cimpossible\u201d to integrate with Facebook, then integrated it less than 18 months later \u2013 momentarily silencing the CEO before he mustered a perfunctory denial.\n\nAlso on rt.com Zuckerberg lays out grand vision of Facebook-fueled utopia \u2013 too bad it bears no resemblance to the platform he's actually built\n\nZuckerberg had help pushing the idea that Libra was a hedge against Chinese supremacy \u2013 Rep. Andy Barr (R-Kentucky) called \u201cthe risks of not innovating\u201d and falling behind other countries in financial technology a \u201cnational security issue,\u201d while ranking Republican Patrick McHenry (North Carolina) declared that \u201cAmerican innovation [was] on trial\u201d in the form of Facebook.\n\nLet us not forget that the wave of innovation is spreading across the world, with or without us.\n\nBut committee chair Maxine Waters (D-California) wasn\u2019t having it, reminding Zuckerberg that Facebook had actually banned cryptocurrency ads from its platform just a year before unveiling Libra \u201cbecause they are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did cryptocurrency go from being misleading and deceptive last year and then becomes a means for financial inclusion this year?\u201d Waters asked.\n\nIt seems to me that you shifted your stance because you realized you could use your size and your users\u2019 data to dominate the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAlso on rt.com An energy black hole? The dirty truth about bitcoin mining\n\nLibra is \u201ctoo big for any single company to undertake on its own,\u201d Zuckerberg said after Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Missouri) asked why so many of Libra\u2019s big-name partners \u2013 Visa, MasterCard, Paypal, eBay \u2013 had jumped ship, acknowledging that the digital currency was \u201ca risky project\u201d and that he didn\u2019t know if it would work. But Zuckerberg said he views the US financial system as \u201coutdated,\u201d and China, he constantly reminded Congress, is working on its own public-private digital currency partnership with payment processor Alipay, which boasts 900 million users.\n\nIs Libra too big to fail? Crypto investors seem to think so.\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plummeted as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to defend his beleaguered digital currency Libra \u2013 a project rapidly losing institutional support as it hits one regulatory hurdle after another.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db0b1ca85f54024b24134b5.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
