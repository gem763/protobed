Peter Braig\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTen per cent of votes were cast against him, in part due to the fact that after 14 years on Cochlear's board, he can no longer be considered an independent.\n\nWhen quizzed about China, where Cochlear has established a manufacturing plant, Mr Holliday-Smith said the company's business strategy was very well aligned with the goals of local Chinese government officials. However, he acknowledged that doing business in the region was inherently more volatile, and what could be a \"green light\" now could switch to a \"red light\".\n\nCochlear's chief executive Dig Howitt said that the total capital expenditure for the Chengdu plant was about $90 million, and the thinking behind it was to do it all in one hit. Thinking long term, this would allow the company to be well embedded in the region with close access to both China and other emerging markets in Asia.\n\nCochlear's three targets are seniors and children in developed markets and children in developing markets.\n\nFor patients and customers in more developed economies, the strategy is around growing market share and increasing penetration.\n\nOne approach that the company is taking to make this happen is to change the threshold at which UK patients are eligible for cochlear implants from being just those with \"profound\" hearing loss to patients \"severe to profound\" hearing loss.", "description": "Cochlear Limited's share price dipped on Tuesday after the company changed its earnings per share (EPS) targets at its annual general meeting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_80/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/36474ea9b4b03bd230635d0cb3794bc804c9fddc", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
