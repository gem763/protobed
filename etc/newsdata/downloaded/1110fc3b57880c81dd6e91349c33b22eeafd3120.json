But since it is August in Paris, in a quiet neighborhood, there are none of the usual, urgent noises of urban street life, and when I look out the window from where I\u2019m sitting, all I can see is sky.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Mr. Brook says, \u201csince I\u2019ve been living here I have this uncanny feeling, although what I normally think of as Paris is just a 15-minute drive from here, that I\u2019m in another country.\u201d\n\n\u2018Never Reach a Conclusion\u2019\n\nIn a way, another country is always where Mr. Brook has aspired to be.\n\nThe London-born son of Russian-Jewish scientists from Latvia (his father patented a popular medicine called Brooklax), the young Peter dreamed of becoming foreign correspondent, \u201cto have the joy of being sent all over the world, month after month, to dangerous struggle spots anywhere \u2014 just to say this world is not the little world of middle-class London.\u201d\n\nAs a student at Oxford University, he also thought he might become a painter, a composer, a pianist and, most particularly, a filmmaker. (He did indeed go on to make movies that include \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d and \u201cMeetings with Remarkable Men,\u201d adapted from a book by Gurdjieff.)\n\nAnd all the while, he says, he was tasting a bit of everything on offer \u2014 in culture, in sex, in drugs (though he was blessed, he says, with a natural resistance to addiction) and in religion.\n\nHe had been confirmed as a member of the Church of England when he was 16. \u201cBut this at once led me to think why \u2014 why is this better than Islam? So I read that, and I read Buddhism. And that led me to India. But all of this was, again: Taste, test, question, and never reach a conclusion.\u201d\n\nHis supreme affinity, always, was for storytelling, he says. And in the theater, he found its most congenial, and universal, application. At 21, he directed an effervescent production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cLove\u2019s Labours Lost\u201d at Stratford; at 23, he was named the producing director of the Royal Opera House; both his interpretations of Shakespeare and of sleek comedies (\u201cThe Little Hut\u201d), costume dramas (\u201cRing Round the Moon\u201d) and even musicals made him the toast of the West End.", "description": "His eyesight failing but schedule still packed, the 94-year-old stage director reflects on a globe-spanning career that includes a New York premiere this week.", "authors": ["Ben Brantley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/arts/22peterbrook1/22peterbrook1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
