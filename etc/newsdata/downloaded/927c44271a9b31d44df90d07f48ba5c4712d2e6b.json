However long he wants to keep playing for is another thing,\" he added.\n\nUnlike Smith, former vice-captain David Warner endured a miserable return from the \"sandpapergate\" scandal, struggling to make double figures against England.\n\nBut Langer said he still had confidence in the explosive opener, who returned to form with a century for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield last week.\n\n\"He had a poor series against England, no doubt. That's just a fact, and he knows that,\" Langer said.\n\n\"But he also hasn't lost his talent, because he was the highest run scorer in the World Cup two weeks before the Ashes started, and he was the highest run scorer in the IPL (Indian Premier League) before that. So he can bat.\n\n\"The other thing about David Warner, my experience tells me that you never write off champion players. And he's a champion player.\"", "description": "Steve Smith's ban on leading Australia ends in March but the star batsman may not want the Test captaincy back, coach Justin Langer says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7775/c9c160a58b03404882fd23f512d80b2c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
