The stone was knocked over.\n\nPolice also said an 18-inch wooden cross was suspended between two trees, and several photos and hand-drawn images were attached to it. Police haven\u2019t identified anyone in the photos.\n\nThey believe the person or persons involved were trying to reenact a scene in a fictional book that features America\u2019s Stonehenge.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Stonehenge, which features cave-like, granite enclosures, has drawn believers who say it\u2019s a thousand or more years old, and skeptics who say the evidence suggests it was the work of a 19th century shoemaker.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police say it appears someone used a power tool to vandalize a stone at group of rock configurations called America's Stonehenge.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/AP_685671826102_c0-216-4992-3126_s1770x1032.jpg?7eeb8b06756f263663c3534cd9159e770c061739"}
