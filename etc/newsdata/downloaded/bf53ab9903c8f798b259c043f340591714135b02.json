Volvo plug-in hybrid owners drive in electric mode only about 40 per cent of the time, Samuelsson said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.\n\nThe XC40 will take 40 minutes to get to 80 per cent battery capacity on a fast-charging system, the company said.\n\nThe XC40, which Volvo unveiled on Thursday in Los Angeles, will have 200 miles (320km) of range in the US, 402 horsepower (296KW) and take 40 minutes to get to 80 per cent battery capacity on a fast-charging system, the company said. That compares with the 240-mile range of Tesla's Model 3 sedan.\n\nSamuelsson said Volvo will start producing its first EV late next year and price it to compete with the Model 3, which starts at about $US39,000 ($57,100) but has been selling on average for roughly $US50,000.\n\n\"It's affordable for a much broader range of people\" than higher-priced luxury brand electric cars, said Volvo's chief technology officer, Henrik Green. The XC40 is \"more like a $US50,000 car than a $US100,000 car\", he said.\n\nThe electric XC40 will join a wave of new EVs debuting to keep up with tightening emissions regulations in China and Europe.\n\nThe electric XC40 will join a wave of new EVs debuting to keep up with tightening emissions regulations in China and Europe. While uptake remains slow, car makers including Volkswagen and Daimler have launched new models like the Audi e-tron and Mercedes EQC to chase after Tesla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVolvo is pushing ahead with its electric ambitions as others in the space struggle. NIO, China's would-be Tesla competitor, is running short of cash. Jia Yueting, founder of electric vehicle start-up Faraday & Future, filed for bankruptcy. And Dyson, the famed maker of vacuum cleaners, pulled the plug on its battery-powered car project.\n\n'Midterm' profitability goal\n\nVolvo would not be making a fully electric XC40 if it wasn't \"absolutely sure\" the car will be profitable, Samuelsson said.\n\n\"It might be lower profit margin initially, but what counts is more midterm\" profitability goals, he said.\n\nThe bet on electrics comes at a time when the car maker is coping with a global sales slowdown and tariffs that led to a 30 per cent drop in first-half operating income. To cut costs, the company plans to merge engine operations with Chinese parent Geely.\n\nSamuelsson said Volvo wants to increase the appeal of electrified vehicles so they sell without government subsidies - and incentives like free charging for the first year.\n\n\"Long term, if this is really going to do something to the climate or the environment, the cars need to be attractive and need to be bought by customers with their own money,\" he said.\n\nThe Volvo XC40 Recharge's battery package.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Volvo is tying the launch of its first all-electric vehicle - the XC40 Recharge crossover - to a broader plan for shrinking the carbon footprint of its models.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2077%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_66/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7c22f4c841ab7878a8fdeb3fff2a7660cd93cc00", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
