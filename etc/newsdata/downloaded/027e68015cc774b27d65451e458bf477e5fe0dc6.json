(Screencap via WXYZ Detroit/Screencap via WXYZ Detroit)\n\nNearly two years after the death of his 21-month-old son, Jonathan Vanderhagen remained angry. The toddler, Killian, died of hydrocephalus just three days after his father filed for full custody from the boy\u2019s mother in 2017, and Vanderhagen saw Facebook as an outlet for not just his grief but as a way to honor his son\u2019s spirit in photos of the boy laughing and playing with musical instruments.\n\nIt was also a way to lash out at the family court judge, Macomb County Circuit Court Judge Rachel Rancilio, who oversaw the custody case in Michigan through which Vanderhagen hoped to win sole custody of his son after alleging the boy\u2019s mother was not taking him to important doctors appointments.\n\n\u201cMy Son\u2019s case 100% contradicts everything you claim to represent,\u201d he wrote in one post on July 8, accompanied by photos of Rancilio hugging her father at a ceremony to join the Michigan governor\u2019s task force on child abuse. \u201cSo wait Rachel you claim to be an advocate for \u2018child abuse & neglect\u2019 \u2026 very interesting \u2026 does my son Killian not fall into that category, does he not matter ?!?!\u201d\n\nIn several posts from early July, he shared some of the judge\u2019s personal social media posts and suggested that Rancilio needed to be removed from her seat on the bench.\n\nThe harsh words left the judge upset. What Vanderhagen viewed as free speech, Rancilio deemed a threat. The 35-year-old Chesterfield Township, Mich., man was arrested for his Facebook posts in July, and spent almost two months in jail awaiting a verdict.\n\nOn Thursday, Vanderhagen was acquitted on the misdemeanor charge of malicious use of a telecommunication device, concluding the case that has gripped the Detroit area for months and rekindled debates about what content represents a legitimate threat on social media.\n\n\u201cI am thankful the jury could see the truth,\u201d Vanderhagen told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\nIn September 2017, Killian died of complications related to hydrocephalus, a health condition he was born with, the Macomb Daily reported. The father alleged that Killian\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t taking him to doctor\u2019s appointments, but police did not press criminal charges in the boy\u2019s death. He had been fighting for sole custody, but the boy was living with his mother when he died.\n\nOn social media, the bearded and tattooed dad frequently writes about his son. He shares photos with his black hair slicked back, laughing with his son or kissing the top of the smiling baby\u2019s head. He posts items and memes featuring Charlie Brown and Snoopy, \u201cPeanuts\u201d characters that were special to his son.\n\nNot even life it self can separate us Killian <3 The next chapter in our story will be our music journey, I will take you around the world just like i always promised i would \ud83c\udfbc\ud83c\udfb9\ud83d\udda4 Posted by Jonathan Vanderhagen on Tuesday, July 23, 2019\n\nThe same online space where Vanderhagen shared memories of better days was also where the father blamed the court for not moving more swiftly in his custody case.\n\n\u201cI wont stop till changes are made, people are held accountable, careers are ended, & these kids get the justice they deserve,\u201d he wrote in one of his Facebook posts.\n\nAfter being made aware of Vanderhagen\u2019s Facebook posts, Rancilio called the Macomb County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which assigned an officer to investigate the content. After watching two videos and reviewing posts in which Vanderhagen accused Rancilio of being corrupt and elitist, the officer concluded the judge wasn\u2019t at risk.\n\n\u201cAt no time does he threaten harm or violence,\u201d the officer\u2019s police report says. \u201cAt this time, it does not appear there is any threat to Judge Rancilio.\u201d\n\nDespite that conclusion, the sheriff\u2019s office increased patrols near the judge\u2019s house. Vanderhagen was arraigned and his bond was set at a $10,000 on July 11, according to court records.\n\nVanderhagen, who paid $1,000 to get out of jail, then promptly returned to his keyboard. He posted several new complaints about how his son had been treated by the court.\n\nA week later, he appeared in court again and a judge determined he had violated the terms of his bond. Among the posts the prosecutor used to paint Vanderhagen as menacing was a photo of himself holding a shovel with Rancilio\u2019s initials photoshopped on the handle in neat, cursive lettering.\n\n\u201cDada back to digging,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou best believe im gonna dig up all the skeletons in this court\u2019s closet.\u201d\n\nDada back to digging & you best believe im gonna dig up all the skeletons in this court's closet \ud83d\ude4c Posted by Jonathan Vanderhagen on Monday, July 8, 2019\n\nWhen she saw that post, Rancilio testified in court, she feared for her life. A single mother of two children, the judge told the court she hired a security guard, installed a new home alarm system and didn\u2019t let her kids play outside alone. Prosecutors argued the bereaved father had crossed a line by collecting information and screen shots from her personal social media accounts \u2014 moving from criticism to online stalking.\n\n\u201cI thought he was going to kill me and bury me after he was done,\u201d she said on the witness stand Tuesday, according to the Detroit Free Press. \u201cI was scared. I was afraid something bad was going to happen to myself or my children.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution argued in court that both the volume and content of Vanderhagen\u2019s posts, especially the ones that included photos of her family members, inspired real fear. Assistant Macomb prosecuting attorney Elizabeth Rittinger said the threats did not need to be direct to frighten the judge.\n\n\u201cIt is undisputed that Rachel Rancilio felt threatened,\u201d Rittinger told the Macomb Daily.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for judges to receive threats on social media and pursue charges against the posters. But those threats are typically more specific and violent than Vanderhagen\u2019s Facebook diatribes.\n\nTwo men threatened to beat an Ohio judge in 2018 who presided over juvenile cases. Earlier this year, an Illinois man who had been scolded by a judge for disrupting court posted her photo and address with the caption, \u201cshe is going to get it.\u201d But whether threats \u2014 even explicit ones \u2014 made on social media are \u201ctrue threats\u201d is a thorny issue that has risen all the way to the Supreme Court, which set a very high bar for defining a threat in its 2015 opinion for Elonis v. United States. To be a threat, the court ruled in an 8-1 decision, the poster has to intend to scare someone.\n\nWhen Vanderhagen was arrested a second time on July 24 for violating a no-contact order by writing more posts on Facebook, his lawyer argued the father didn\u2019t mean for Rancilio to feel afraid.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no threats,\u201d argued attorney Nicholas Somberg at a bail hearing after his client was arrested again and held on a $500,000 bond, the Macomb Daily reported. \u201cThere\u2019s no reaching out to Judge Rancilio. There\u2019s been no contact. There\u2019s no inadvertent messages. All the messages after the no contact (order) are all very innocuous. There\u2019s things going on behind the scenes, so what?\u201d\n\nA Michigan jury agreed. The jurors deliberated for 26 minutes on Thursday before Vanderhagen was acquitted and released.\n\n\u201cI think that Jonathan should continue speaking the truth, I think he should continue researching our elected public officials and telling people what happened to him and warning other people about the court system,\u201d Somberg said after the verdict.\n\nRancilio did not immediately return a request for comment late Thursday night.\n\nVanderhagen told the court he had been digging up information about the court to warn people about his bad experiences. He added that he did not mean to threaten or harass the judge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not to terrorize her,\u201d he said, according to the Detroit Free Press, \u201cit\u2019s to warn people.\u201d", "description": "Jonathan Vanderhagen blamed a judge for his son's death in 2017.
