The measure has support from civil rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), but faces opposition from a state veterans group and the organization Washington Asians for Equality, which claims the measure would lead to preferential treatment for some groups.\n\nThis summer, some of those opponents partnered with a more notorious organization: the Proud Boys, who featured the signature drive in a recently surfaced propaganda video.\n\nThe Proud Boys\u2014designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2014prioritizes street fights and has extensive connections to more explicit white supremacist organizations. But unlike many other extremist groups, the Proud Boys frequently cozy up to the more mainstream right. Their current leader, Enrique Tarrio, is a Florida director of Latinos for Trump, despite marching in 2017\u2019s deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nRepublicans Are Adopting the Proud Boys\n\nIn the August video, a Washington Proud Boy claims Referendum 88 backers solicited the Proud Boys\u2019 help in delivering signatures to the secretary of state\u2019s office.\n\nThe group \u201cgave us a call asking for security to help take the signatures for Referendum 88 down to the capitol building,\u201d he says in the video, which referendum supporters like the group Washington Fairness surfaced this week.\n\nThe video goes on to show the group riding in a truck with the signatures and speaking into walkie-talkies for reasons that are not immediately apparent. The clip concludes with an advertisement for gas masks, which the Proud Boy says he used during a summer brawl with anti-fascists in Portland, Oregon.\n\nReject Ref. 88, the organization that allegedly hired the Proud Boys, disavowed knowledge of them.\n\n\u201cThe Referendum 88 petition drive worked with many volunteers during the signature gathering phase,\u201d organizer Linda Yang said in an email. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know the association of these individuals you refer to, nor did they tell us. The Reject Ref.88/I-1000 campaign welcomes people from all walks of life who believe in equality for all, regardless of race. Those who don\u2019t believe in that principle\u2014be they on the far left or the far right\u2014are not welcome in this campaign.\u201d\n\nBut as the Seattle Stranger noted, Yang even appeared in the Proud Boys\u2019 video, explaining her opposition to Referendum 88. In the video, she gives different account of her group coming to work with the Proud Boys.\n\nAfter trying and failing to hire a security company to help deliver referendum signatures, \u201cI got a call saying \u2018hey there\u2019s a group, they\u2019re willing to help,\u2019\u201d she said in the video. \u201cI said \u2018we\u2019ll take it.\u2019\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
