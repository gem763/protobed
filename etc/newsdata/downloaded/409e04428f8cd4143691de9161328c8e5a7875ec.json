We may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Pricing and availability is subject to change.\n\nWhen we think of Beats headphones, we think of the bulky over-the-ear styles you can spot from a mile away. The brand has a way more discreet option \u2014 and it\u2019s just as powerful as the iconic pair we love.\n\nIntrigued? We found an awesome pair of Powerbeats3 headphones and they\u2019re on sale at Amazon! The Beats Powerbeats Pro are discounted down to $200, or $50 off its list price. That\u2019s a 20 percent savings on the company\u2019s brand new true wireless headphones!\n\nAlthough they are part of the same company, the Powerbeats Pro is Beats\u2019 effort to beat (no pun intended) Apple\u2019s AirPods. The Powerbeats have everything a great pair of wireless headphones should have, including a compact build, a 9-hour battery life, stylish and functional earhooks that provide a secure fit and, most importantly, top-notch sound with a wide audio design and thumping bass. They also feature the brand\u2019s \u201cFast Fuel\u201d technology that gives about an hour-and-a-half of battery life on only a five-minute charge. Now that\u2019s fast!\n\nWhile the Powerbeats Pro do not have active noise-canceling, they do offer strong noise isolation with its sealed in-ear design when paired with its included customizable eartips. They seamlessly sync to just about any iPhone, iPad or MacBoo, thanks to Apple\u2019s W1 chip built-in. However, they work just as well with Android smartphones and tablets via Bluetooth.\n\nIn addition, they\u2019re also sweat- and water-resistant for workouts and long runs. The Beats Powerbeats Pro come with a trusty charging case, four eartips in various sizes and a Lightning-to-USB-A charging cable.\n\nNot bad for $200.\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro have a 4.1 out five stars with over 700 reviews. (Photo: Apple) More\n\nThere are hundreds of positive reviews on Amazon, with many five-star reviewers noting how great the battery life and sound quality is on these devices.\n\n\u201cFirst, I need to start with the fact that I\u2019m extremely picky when it comes to headphones and I\u2019ve bought over 20 pairs from Amazon from brands to no brands,\u201d one enthusiastic reviewer shared. \u201cThese are the first pair of headphones that I\u2019ve worn to the gym that have not needed a single adjustment! I have weird ears and no in-ear headphones have ever fit me this well. The seal is great and it just doesn\u2019t move!\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I am a huge Beats fan and have about 5 different pairs,\u201d one reviewer raved. \u201cI have enjoyed the Powerbeats line up for years but was waiting until they finally came out without wires! I do have AirPods as well but I can't keep them in my ears. I don\u2019t work out so I didn't need these for working out ;I needed them for wireless buds that wouldn't fall out and I found them!!! Great quality! In my opinion stronger than the AirPods. 5 STARS!!!\u201d\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro come in an assortment of colors, including Navy, Moss, Black and Ivory. The choice is yours!\n\nThe reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\n\nRead More from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
