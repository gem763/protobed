Carmen had already beaten three bouts of cancer and while she was a 'survivor', she was also tired.\n\nAfter nine months in hospital, Carmen chose to stop seeking treatment.\n\nCarmen (left) and her niece Jess (right) were always close. Jess is hoping to continue her aunt's legacy in Los Angeles\n\nPaula (right) has since become an ambassador for the Australian Gynaecological Cancer Foundation - an organisation Carmen (left) helped to build and was passionate about\n\nWHAT IS VAGINAL CANCER? Vaginal cancer most commonly occurs in the muscular tube that connects your uterus with your outer genitals, or the birth canal. It is extremely rare, and often there are little to no symptoms in the early stages. As the disease progesses, symptoms include: Unusual vaginal bleeding, for example, after intercourse or after menopause Watery vaginal discharge A lump or mass in your vagina Painful or frequent urination Constipation Pelvic pain Source: Mayo Clinic\n\n'As devastated as our family are and were, we needed to respect her decision,' Jess said. 'No one fought more graciously than Aunty Carr.'\n\nCarmen was always vocal about her health concerns and wanted to popularise discussions about cancer and other chronic conditions.\n\nShe became an advocate for multiple organisations over the years, helping to raise money and awareness for cancer research and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\n\nAnd now her sister is carrying the legacy.\n\nPaula was recently named an ambassador for the Australian Gynaecological Cancer Foundation - an organisation her sister helped to build and was passionate about.\n\n'Just like many other cancers, without research on prevention or cure there is little hope for so many women to survive these horrible diseases,' Paula said of her work.\n\n'If we had never got behind breast cancer\u2026 If we continued to ignore prostate or bowel cancer \u2013 how many more lives would have been lost?\n\n'In many cases women suffer symptoms in silence when they have an abnormality in their reproductive or gynaecological organs\u2026 and yet that is the place where women bring forth life into the world.'\n\nWhile Paula is continuing the legacy Carmen left in her personal life, Jess is sharing her inspirational story across the pond.\n\nHaving grown up in the Australian film industry, with Carmen for an aunt and both of her parents, Paula and John Orcsik, starring in long-running soap opera Cop Shop, Jess always knew she'd work in the industry.\n\nCarmen was always vocal about her health concerns and wanted to popularise discussions about cancer and other chronic conditions\n\nCarmen herself made the move to Hollywood after establishing herself as a household name on Australian television screens\n\nShe moved to the United States to launch her own television and film company and established the Carmen Duncan Scholarship to honour her aunt after her passing.\n\nThe scholarship offers one teenager and one adult the opportunity to move to Los Angeles for three months and participate in workshops and classes to build their skills and connections in an industry so close to Carmen's heart.\n\nFAMILY'S TRIBUTE TO A 'TRAILBLAZER' 'Carmen was an amazing aunt, mother and friend. 'She was a dedicated actress and admired by so many creatives that she worked with. 'She lived each day to the fullest, and was always very grateful for the success she was able to endure in her career. 'She travelled across the globe, met some of the most amazing people in some exotic locations and made life long friends no matter where she travelled too. 'She stayed in touch with those friends no matter what was happening in her life and even on her death bed. 'I won't forget when I sat with her for many hours and spent time responding to every message she had received. 'Her heart was always full of love for the people in her life and she made sure that they all knew how important to her they were. 'I think that was her greatest gift. I know she always made me feel like I was truly special and loved so much.'\n\n'CDS is looking for actors who are brave, strong, and determined just like she was,' Jess said of the scholarship. 'It's for anyone who dared to dream.'\n\n'The scholarship was set up not only to build opportunities for Australian talent, but to honour her memory and keep her legacy alive in many generations of actors still to come.'\n\nCarmen made the move to Hollywood after establishing herself as a household name on Australian television screens.\n\n'Its important for people to know how much of a trailblazer she really was in her generation of actors,' Jess told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'At that time many of the Australian actors that we recognise as trailblazers today hadn't even begun to make their mark on the US as yet, so it was quite remarkable that she had a such an impact.'\n\n'Adjusting to the cultural shift is a huge transition for most people. Aunty Carr made it look easy, even though it is far from easy.'\n\nHer film credits include Don't Let It Get You, Harlequin and Touch And Go.\n\nShe also appeared in multiple Australian TV dramas over the years, from Water Rats, to All Saints, A Country Practice, Winners and Losers and Cop Shop alongside her younger sister and Paula's then husband, John Orcisk.\n\nCarmen was nominated for an Emmy for her portrayal of Iris Carrington Wheeler on hit US soap Another World, and most recently worked alongside Oscar winner Dev Patel in the feature film Hotel Mumbai.\n\nJess went on to say Carmen was a loyal and consistent friend, even on her death bed.\n\n'I won't forget when I sat with her for many hours and spent time responding to every message she had received,' she said.\n\n'Her heart was always full of love for the people in her life and she made sure that they all knew how important to her they were.'\n\nCarmen (right) and Paula (left) both pushed one another to be better performers", "description": "The Australian Emmy-award nominee and star of the small screen died in February aged 76 of a rare form of vaginal cancer.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/15/19956366-0-image-a-260_1571580277910.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
