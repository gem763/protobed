It has regularly posted pieces on politics, culture and the media together with sports stories.\n\nBut management and staff members have butted heads since the financial equity firm Great Hills Partners bought Deadspin along with sister sites like The Root, Gizmodo and Jezebel earlier this year. Several of the sites were part of Gawker Media, which declared bankruptcy and shut down after losing a legal battle with wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nG/O Media recently shut down the news site Splinter.\n\nMegan Greenwell, Deadspin\u2019s former editor in chief, quit in August after posting a long article about her disputes with the new company. \u201cMy colleagues and I know that most Deadspin readers do not want the site to stick to sports,\u201d she wrote.\n\nA deputy editor there, Barry Petchesky, tweeted on Tuesday that he had been fired for not following the edict.\n\nPaul Maidment, G/O editorial director, wrote in a memo to staff on Monday that was reported in The Daily Beast that \u201cDeadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\u201d\n\nDespite the edict, Deadspin journalists appeared in open revolt. Posts on wedding dress codes , a stolen pumpkin and a staff member\u2019s encounter with three dogs . The phrase \u201cstick to sports\u201d was mockingly attached to each of the posts.\n\nA story by Ray Ratto, headlined \u201cNationals Fans Didn\u2019t Stick to Sports,\u201d included a statement saying \u201cthat this post doesn\u2019t contain a heaping helping of political vitriol isn\u2019t \u2018sticking to sports\u2019 any more than inviting the president to a game, playing the national anthem, \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d or the flyover is sticking to sports. Nobody sticks to sports, ever.\u201d\n\nThe dispute is also reminiscent of ESPN, amid a controversy over former anchor Jemele Hill\u2019s tweets about President Trump, urging its personalities to train their focus on sports and not politics.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Seven staff members at the popular website Deadspin quit on Wednesday as part of a dispute with management over its focus, a spokesman said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Bauder"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
