Declines were recorded among students with the highest scores and among those with the lowest scores. In math, there was a small improvement among fourth-graders but a small drop in grade eight, driven by declines among lower-performing students.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe national results, reported on a 500-point scale, were based on testing of about 300,000 fourth-graders and 290,600 eighth-graders. The changes since 2017 were sometimes a shift of a single point, a small but statistically significant change.\n\nNAEP, often referred to as the \u201cnation\u2019s report card,\u201d is a closely watched exam because it assesses the performance of children from all racial and socioeconomic backgrounds in urban, suburban and rural communities. The government first administered a version of the exam in 1990, and it tests fourth- and eighth-graders in math and reading every other year.\n\nThis year, the District and Mississippi were the only jurisdictions to improve on three of the four metrics evaluated. And when compared with the 50 states, the District made the largest gains in fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math over the three decades since the test was first administered.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cD.C. continues to make remarkable gains. The level of progress is really unprecedented, both in magnitude and for how long it has been sustained,\u201d said Hanseul Kang, the D.C. state superintendent of education. \u201cWe were so far behind that we weren\u2019t even in the game. And now, we are in the game and on the rise.\u201d\n\nMaryland saw a decline in results for fourth- and eighth-graders in English and math. One possible explanation is an increased number of English-language learners over the past decade.\n\nIn Virginia, math results remained steady, while reading scores declined since 2017. The results mirror declines on Virginia\u2019s statewide standardized reading tests.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cVirginia\u2019s schools are enrolling increasing numbers of students whose learning is impacted by poverty and trauma,\u201d James Lane, Virginia\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, said in a statement. \u201cAny strategy to raise achievement in reading must address this challenge.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLane said state and local officials in Virginia are working on ways to improve reading instruction. This month, he issued a memo to superintendents emphasizing the importance of daily reading and included resources for instruction.\n\nNationally, jurisdictions saw the biggest decline in 2019 on eighth-grade reading scores, with a three-point drop out of the 500 possible points. While some changes were small, this one was a \u201cvery meaningful decline,\u201d said Peggy G. Carr, associate commissioner for the federal government\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is critical that researchers further explore the declines we are seeing here,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, attributes the national stagnation to the lingering effects of the recession a decade ago. He said the struggles of low-income families were especially pronounced through these years, affecting their children\u2019s long-term educational success. In addition, states cut funding for schools, hurting progress.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we are still seeing the effect of that, even as states are starting to open their wallets again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is that today\u2019s booming economy, and increases in school spending, should help to improve results going forward. But maybe not until 2022 or 2023.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe District was the only jurisdiction that experienced a significant increase in eighth-grade reading.\n\n\u201cThere is clearly something good happening in D.C. when it comes to eighth-grade scores,\u201d said Matthew Chingos, vice president of education data and policy at the Urban Institute .\n\nThe increase was driven largely by the performance of Hispanic students, who posted an eight-point increase in test scores since 2017. Black eighth-grade students had a one-point increase on the reading exam, and white students registered a one-point decline.\n\nAD\n\nEven so, a significant achievement gap persists between white students in the District and their Hispanic and black peers, although the gaps narrowed on this year\u2019s test.\n\nAD\n\nOverall, black, Hispanic and white students made gains on the test, and Kang said the city\u2019s overall growth on the test cannot be attributed to demographic shifts in the city.\n\nThe boost in the District\u2019s scores was largely driven by improvements among students attending traditional public schools. Results from the charter sector \u2014 which are publicly funded and privately operated campuses that educate nearly half of the District\u2019s public school children \u2014 remained largely stagnant since 2017.\n\nKang attributed the District\u2019s gains to investments in high-quality teachers and early-childhood education. The city has offered universal prekindergarten since 2008, and she said the city is increasing access to quality child care for infants.\n\nThe traditional public school system is one of 27 urban school districts to participate in the Trial Urban District Assessment, which allows comparisons across districts.\n\nDonna St. George and Debbie Truong contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The District was the only jurisdiction to improve on eighth-grade reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
