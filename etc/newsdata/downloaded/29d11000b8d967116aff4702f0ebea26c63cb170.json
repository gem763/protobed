The WAAAX basket has risen an average of 350 per cent over the two years to September 30 and trades on an average multiple of more than 100 times earnings.\n\nGrowth outlook\n\nSpeedcast International, for example, fell 40 per cent in July after a downgrade.\n\nAlthough the economic data still presents the global manufacturing sector as being in recession, bonds have sold off sharply in advanced economies, including in Australia where the yield on the 10-year government bond has increased to 1.17 per cent from 0.88 per cent in August.\n\n\"Even though the growth outlook still seems gloomy, the easing of trade tensions between the US and China and some hope around Brexit has been enough to shift sentiment and put a floor under the bond market,\" said Sage Capital managing director Sean Fenton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Throw in some short reports and regulatory concerns on stocks that were beginning to be priced for perfection and it\u2019s not surprising to see some rotation from growth to value.\"\n\nWhat's unclear, Mr Fenton said, is whether this is the start of a new market dynamic or a three-day trade. \"For the rotation to have legs we will need to see business confidence improve substantially, which probably requires a more definitive trade deal. The underlying fabric of the global economy remains intact and money is free so an improvement in confidence could certainly drive an upswing in activity.\"\n\nIn the background, WeWork's escalation from IPO hopeful to needing a rescue to avert a cash crunch has underscored how quickly the optics of growth can change.\n\nAcquired rather than being floated\n\nFederation Asset Management chairman Greg Bundy pointed to WeWork\u2019s speculated IPO valuation of about $US40 billion and reported speculation that Softbank has valued it at $US8 billion.\n\n\"You would have to question what the books look like,\u201d he said. \u201cHow did a lot of smart people get something so wrong?\n\nWhat WeWork shows \"is that some companies should stay private for longer.\u201d\n\nMr Bundy said there\u2019s a five-to-one margin of companies getting acquired rather than being floated in Silicon Valley.\n\nAfterpay shares advanced nearly 2 per cent to $29.21 on Tuesday. The regulatory risk surrounding the Reserve Bank's review of payments is manageable for Afterpay Touch, says Morgan Stanley, believing the stock \"looks oversold on misplaced concerns\".\n\nThe issue for investors appears to be the future of Afterpay's no-surcharge rule, which prevents merchants from recovering the costs associated with the buy now, pay later juggernaut's systems from customers.", "description": "A rotation from growth to value is a welcome change for the Australian market, but nobody can say with any confidence if it lasts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.299%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_135/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b7dbb7fc6977d91d2c3904e9b8416b741866a44d", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
