J.B. Pritzker said.\n\nMiguel Perez Jr., 41, who was born in Mexico, doesn't have US citizenship but had a green card as a permanent US resident. He joined the Army in 2002 and served in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury. He's been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nPerez in 2008 was accused of giving a laptop case of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He pleaded guilty to a drug crime and spent seven years in prison. He was deported last year after failing to persuade a federal appeals court to block his removal.\n\n\"Miguel Perez should not have been deported,\" said Pritzker, a Democrat, who blamed the \"bigoted immigration policy of President Trump\" and former Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who declined to pardon Perez before the deportation.\n\nRead more: A US Army veteran who served 2 tours in Afghanistan has been deported to Mexico over a drug charge\n\nAn email seeking comment on the next steps was sent to US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nA Chicago pastor, the Rev. Emma Lozano, said Perez needs to be \"treated with the dignity and honor he deserves.\"\n\nThe pardon sends a \"strong message that the entire state wants him to come back home,\" Lozano said.\n\nPerez had lived in the US since he was a young boy.\n\n\"I went to war for this country out of love for this country,\" Perez said before he was deported.\n\nSome other Democratic governors also have pardoned immigrants threatened with deportation to show their opposition to Trump's tough immigration policy.\n\nEarlier this month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom pardoned a Vietnamese immigrant facing possible deportation for a 15-year-old gang crime.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pardoned several immigrants faced with possible deportation for past crimes at the end of last year. He also pardoned a Gambian immigrant in March who had been convicted of offenses including unlicensed selling of clothes.", "description": "US Army veteran Miguel Perez Jr., who was born in Mexico, had a green card as a permanent resident.
