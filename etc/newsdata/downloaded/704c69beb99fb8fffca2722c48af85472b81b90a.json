The Danny Dimes era couldn\u2019t have gotten off to a much better start, as the rookie QB threw for 336 yards (9.3 YPA) and four touchdowns against an improved Tampa Bay defense that entered with the highest blitz rate in the NFL and allowing just 6.4 YPA with one passing TD on the year. Jones lost two fumbles and wasn\u2019t perfect, but his mobility provided a stark difference to Eli Manning\u2019s, and the Giants\u2019 offense scored 22 second-half points despite losing Saquon Barkley.\n\nJones had some not pretty stats in college and was considered a reach by most at pick No. 6, but he was extremely impressive throughout the preseason, and Pat Shurmur\u2019s system is QB-friendly. Jones\u2019 running ability isn\u2019t a fluke (he rushed for 17 touchdowns in three years during college), and it\u2019s what makes him interesting in fantasy terms right away. Jones\u2019 move into the starting lineup is huge news for all of New York\u2019s offense, increasing the value of Sterling Shepard while making Wayne Gallman a far more attractive free agent add now that Barkley reportedly could miss several weeks with a high ankle sprain.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEvan Engram is another beneficiary, as he put up a monster game, pulled down this one-handed catch and would be worth a third-round pick in a fantasy draft today. He and Shepard are going to be extra busy with Barkley sidelined.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe loss of Barkley is brutal to fantasy gamers, and it\u2019s especially cruel knowing his stacked boxes were about to become less frequent now that he has a capable quarterback sharing the backfield with him. But Giants fans aren\u2019t complaining quite as loud now that Danny Dimes is upon us.\n\nOn the other side, Jameis Winston had his best game of the season with 380 yards (10.3 YPA) and three TD strikes to Mike Evans, who absolutely erupted for 190 yards on 15 targets, as Janoris Jenkins was often helpless in one-on-one coverage. O.J. Howard finished third among tight ends in air yards this week, so he\u2019s got a pulse still. Ronald Jones also outplayed Peyton Barber, and let\u2019s hope the former continues to get more work.\n\nIt was nice to see Tampa Bay\u2019s offense get going, but they won\u2019t often be playing a team without a pass rush like New York (to go along with its inexperienced secondary), but the Bucs\u2019 offense completely disappeared in the second half, scoring just three points. They have an upcoming road tilt against a tough Rams defense.\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThis game had the highest total of the week, but poor weather and a 6-0 first quarter had it looking like a defensive battle before things opened up. Lamar Jackson lost the battle with Patrick Mahomes but ran for his first score of the year despite Mark Ingram adding three rushing TDs himself \u2026 Only three times has a quarterback opened the season with at least three TD passes without a pick in the first three games, and they are Peyton Manning (2010) and Mahomes this year and last. Mahomes is unreal and looks like the exception to the rule on waiting for QBs even in leagues that aren\u2019t Superflex \u2026 Marquise Brown finished second only to Mike Evans in air yards this week, which is certainly encouraging moving forward \u2026 Demarcus Robinson\u2019s one-handed touchdown grab was nice, while Justin Tucker\u2019s crazy onside kick attempt saved Baltimore a timeout \u2026 Darrell Williams obviously needs to be added in all leagues and has massive potential should KC\u2019s backfield injuries persist. He\u2019s clearly the RB to have over Darwin Thompson and legitimately has top-10 type upside if LeSean McCoy and Damien Williams were out.\n\nDenver Broncos @ Green Bay Packers\n\nThe winless Broncos haven\u2019t recorded a sack (or a turnover) this season, while Joe Flacco has already been sacked 11 times \u2026 Royce Freeman lost a couple of goal-line carries while dealing with an injury, but the backfield committee remains in Denver \u2026 Everyone rostering Davante Adams can simply write this one off to facing Chris Harris, while Marquez Valdes-Scantling benefitted and continues to creep into WR2 territory (he finished third in WOPR this week). Green Bay\u2019s passing attack is set up to get right in a home matchup Thursday against Philadelphia\u2019s inviting secondary.\n\nDetroit Lions @ Philadelphia Eagles\n\nCarson Wentz badly missed his top wide receivers and now gets to travel during a short week to face a vastly improved Packers defense that\u2019s recorded 12 sacks with a 1:4 TD:INT ratio to open the season \u2026 Nelson Agholor had just 17 yards with a lost fumble at halftime but bounced back with two scores afterward, while Miles Sanders notably had two fumbles (losing one) after having the highest fumble rate in college football last season \u2026 Kenny Golladay busted in a highly favorable situation, but Marvin Jones came through, while Kerryon Johnson\u2019s goal-line TD saved a day that otherwise featured just 36 yards on 20 carries and one lonely target.\n\nCincinnati Bengals @ Buffalo Bills\n\nThe leading receivers in this game were Dawson Knox and Audren Tate, and the leading rusher was a 36-year-old \u2026 Josh Allen is fun and developing faster and better than could\u2019ve been reasonably expected, and Buffalo\u2019s defense is legit, but it\u2019s safe to be skeptical of the Bills\u2019 3-0 start. It\u2019s a matchup of undefeated teams when Buffalo hosts New England in Week 4.\n\nAtlanta Falcons @ Indianapolis Colts\n\nThe Colts\u2019 offense struggled badly after T.Y. Hilton departed, and his status will be important for the whole offense moving forward. Parris Campbell and Deon Cain don\u2019t seem ready to step up \u2026 Devonta Freeman still hasn\u2019t scored but rebounded with 5.5 YPC while seeing four targets and Ito Smith leave with a concussion ... Another week, another trip to the end zone for Touchdown Julio \u2026 This Atlanta defense appears to defend running backs as receivers far better than their league-worst unit last year.\n\nOakland Raiders @ Minnesota Vikings\n\nKirk Cousins is averaging 15.5 pass attempts in two home games this season (both wins), and while Adam Thielen scored twice (thanks to a goal-line carry), he and Stefon Diggs combined for just eight targets, and they are both going to have an awfully hard time meeting their ADPs given Minnesota\u2019s play-calling that\u2019s dated back to the second half of last season. Cousins struggled badly last week from a clean pocket, so it was nice to see him bounce back, although it was all in a hitter\u2019s count \u2026 Darren Waller is a beast and has secured 26-of-29 targets this season, although he\u2019s still searching for his first score.\n\nNew York Jets @ New England Patriots\n\nThe Jets somehow covered in this game thanks to two defensive/special teams touchdowns in the final 16 minutes, but New England\u2019s D continues to impress. They\u2019ve yielded an NFL-low 5.2 YPA and have yet to allow a touchdown this season. In fact, the Pats\u2019 defense has ceded just one TD in the first half of their last eight games. Their next three are against the Bills, Redskins, and Giants \u2026 After going 49-of-50 on extra points last season, Stephen Gostkowski has missed three already \u2026 The departure of Antonio Brown is an obvious upgrade for Josh Gordon and Julian Edelman, but Phillip Dorsett is now a must-have as well. He\u2019s shown real signs of a breakout and is now looking at an opportunity again, making him a fine flex option and one injury away from being a major fantasy difference-maker.\n\nMiami Dolphins @ Dallas Cowboys\n\nThe Cowboys covered the massive spread, but Dallas was up just 10-6 at halftime, and that was with Miami missing a field goal, losing a fumble at the goal line and failing on an onside kick attempt, so this game was in doubt for too long for the many who used Dallas in Survivor this week \u2026 Preston Williams is emerging as the only interesting fantasy property in Miami, while it might be worth making sure the person with Ezekiel Elliott in your league still values him properly as a top-five commodity \u2026 Amari Cooper was matched up a lot with Xavien Howard and had a bad drop but turned his other six targets into six catches for 88 yards and two scores, while Randall Cobb had a 74-yard touchdown wiped out by a holding penalty.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Arizona Cardinals\n\nIn what projected as this week\u2019s fastest-paced game, 58 points didn\u2019t disappoint, although Kyler Murray did with just 4.0 YPA and eight sacks taken (at least he started running, adding 69 rushing yards). Kyle Allen, meanwhile, was a huge upgrade over Cam Newton, getting 10.0 YPA with a 4:0 TD:INT ratio. It was against a very beatable Arizona secondary, but it was also hard not to be impressed with Allen, who\u2019s going to be a big help to the fantasy values of Curtis Samuel, DJ Moore, and Greg Olsen \u2026 David Johnson\u2019s YPC remains a concern, but this TD was nice \u2026 Christian McCaffrey has moves \u2026 Larry Fitzgerald recorded back-to-back 100-yard games to start a season for the first time in his career and found the end zone, while Christian Kirk saw 12 targets and is a buy-low candidate (although he dropped a beautiful dime from Murray on Sunday).\n\nLarry Fitzgerald is enjoying a resurgent season alongside Kyler Murray. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNew Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks\n\nAlvin Kamara certainly didn\u2019t miss Drew Brees this game, although it was an odd one that featured two defensive/special teams touchdowns by New Orleans, and this Seattle D hasn\u2019t looked great \u2026 Tyler Lockett had a monster game (14-11-154-1), while DK Metcalf continues to ball \u2026 Chris Carson lost yet another fumble (and left a bunch of yards on the field Sunday) and even ceded a goal-line carry to C.J. Prosise as a result. Rashaad Penny\u2019s injury in practice was very unfortunate timing for those rostering him.\n\nHouston Texans @ Los Angeles Chargers\n\nKeenan Allen had one of the week\u2019s biggest performances, while Deshaun Watson overcame a big disadvantage up front to throw for 351 yards (10.3 YPA) and avoided taking at least three sacks for the first time in 12 games \u2026 Jordan Akins is the last man standing at tight end for Houston, and his two touchdowns Sunday put him on the fantasy radar. He\u2019s a good athlete, and the Texans could continue struggling to run the ball like they did Sunday with their O-line and are sure to suffer injuries at wide receiver.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers @ San Francisco 49ers\n\nThis was an ugly game highlighted by six fumbles, although it\u2019s tough to judge Mason Rudolph and James Conner during their first action without Ben Roethlisberger on the road against a San Francisco defense that\u2019s played extremely well this season \u2026 Jeff Wilson Jr. became the first player in franchise history to score two touchdowns during their first two games with San Francisco ... The 49ers had their first three-and-out of the season in the second half, and Sunday marked the first time since 1998 that the team won a game in which they committed five turnovers and also started a season 3-0. Will they just let me cash my 49ers to win the Super Bowl ticket now?\n\nLos Angeles Rams @ Cleveland Browns\n\nJared Goff threw multiple TDs on the road for the first time since Nov. 4 with Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods and Brandin Cooks seeing a whopping 32 of his 38 targets. Kupp scored twice and has emerged as the clear preferred LA receiver to roster thanks to his usage in the red zone \u2026 Baker Mayfield could definitely play better, but he\u2019s dealing with a poor offensive line, and there\u2019s little doubt coaching remains a big problem in Cleveland \u2026 Nick Chubb had a TD run taken away by a shaky penalty and watched the Browns call four straight pass plays from first-and-goal at the four-yard line with all of their timeouts remaining at the end of the game. Chubb did encouragingly see seven targets, but his next two matchups (@Bal and @SF) aren\u2019t easy \u2026 Todd Gurley was given a season-low 14 touches and managed just 3.1 YPC against a Browns defense that entered allowing the fourth-most fantasy points to running backs.\n\nFollow the Yahoo fantasy football crew on Twitter: Andy Behrens, Dalton Del Don, Brad Evans, Matt Harmon, Liz Loza, Scott Pianowski and Tank Williams\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Week 3 was dominated by the young QBs like Daniel Jones, but star fantasy asset, Saquon Barkley, went down with an injury.
