(In March.) They beat Wade Miley. (Also in March.)\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n(Still counts. Mattering is different than counting.)\n\nThey won two other games.\n\nIn August, Justin Verlander beat them by, like, 14. Actually, exactly 14. Which is how a ballclub goes about winning four of seven games and getting outscored by 13 runs.\n\nThe 107-win Astros lost season series to five teams, including the Rays, and also including the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds, which only illustrates how some days people may just not feel like playing baseball.\n\nAnd, also, how the difference between the Astros\u2019 107 wins and the Rays\u2019 96 \u2014 97 as of Wednesday night\u2019s game in Oakland, by a score of 5-1, in which a wild-card record crowd cheered the 54,005 who showed up and mourned the nine who did not \u2014 is perhaps not as vast as it would appear. That is to say, the Astros would seem to be the far better team and the Rays will not grant them that for at least another three games, if at all.\n\nThis best-of-five American League Division Series opens Friday in Houston, two days after the Rays spent 94 pitches from stand-in ace Charlie Morton to get there, and so the wild-card game achieved its objectives of being interesting, being scary and being punitive. The more accomplished team \u2014 the Astros \u2014 waits, rests and schemes. The Rays, alternatively, flew to Oakland, eliminated the A\u2019s with the sort of surgical game they can play and often did for the prior six months, the right pitch at the right time, the right pitcher at the right time, and just enough offense \u2014 in this case four home runs, all hit to their middle or opposite fields. Then they rushed the field, carried on for a while, had a few beers in the clubhouse, laughed at what a time they were having, waved away the cigar smoke and boarded a flight for Houston, for Verlander, Cole and Zack Greinke, in that order, and if that seems like a big job it\u2019s because it will be.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s cool and satisfying about being a Tampa Bay Ray. It\u2019s always a big job. The other ballparks are fuller and louder. The other rosters are better paid. The other players they know from the magazine covers and the television specials, from the MVP ceremonies, from all the crazy free-agency hype and fancy endorsement deals.\n\nNone of which has anything to do with who plays the better baseball.\n\nSo they bussed in from San Francisco on Wednesday afternoon, over the bridge and past the warehouses and junkyards and toward the six light banks that loom over the Coliseum to play a team that won 97 games, that like them assumes every job is a big job, whose center-field seats rise up like the leading edge of a drawbridge, whose fans wave flags and blow horns and bang drums and drape handmade signs over rusted handrails and stained concrete.\n\nAnd it is perfect. It summons their best baseball. Morton grants it wasn\u2019t his finest start, but it was, \u201call right,\u201d and then the bullpen, men by the names of Diego Castillo and Nick Anderson and Emilio Pag\u00e1n, allow three singles and strike out eight over the final four innings.\n\n\u201cThe postseason is just different,\u201d said Morton, who has pitched in four of them. \u201cAll it takes is the right timing. For your team to get hot.\u201d\n\nHe gestured, presumably toward Houston.\n\n\u201cOne of those two guys over there is going to win the Cy Young,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact. They got Greinke. And pitch by pitch, inning by inning, we\u2019re just going to have to be better.\u201d\n\nThe Rays hit home runs like almost everyone else. They just weren\u2019t gluttonous about it. They hit 217, not even the franchise record. They had four guys with at least 20, one with 33. The man who hit two on Wednesday night was none of those. In fact, Yandy Diaz, up until Sunday, was healing from a foot injury, grinding through at-bats in Port Charlotte, Florida, against a bunch of 19- and 20-year-olds in the Instructional League. By the time of his seventh-inning single, he\u2019d had seven big-league at-bats since July. And in consecutive at-bats against A\u2019s lefty Sean Manaea, against consecutive up-and-away fastballs, Diaz homered to right field. The balls landed within about 20 feet of each other. Same preparation. Same approach. Same mechanics. Same thoughts. Same results.\n\nThen they get on an airplane and try it again in another day or two, take on that job, see if that one isn\u2019t big too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not ready to stop at all,\u201d center fielder Kevin Kiermaier said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. We can beat anyone in baseball and people know that. You know, people said there\u2019s no way we could win 95 or 96 games. And that\u2019s OK. We can do special things if we go handle our business. We\u2019ve done that since Day 1.\u201d\n\nOn Day 1, turns out, they lost to Justin Verlander in St. Petersburg. He was really good that day. And the point still stands. Because, after that, the Rays did that pitch-by-pitch, inning-by-inning thing and won those 96 games. Then that 97th. And then had more games to play.\n\n\u201cNobody likes facing our pitching staff,\u201d third baseman Matt Duffy said. \u201cI know Houston\u2019s got the starting rotation. I think through a whole season there\u2019s not many pitching staffs that can do what ours did.\u201d\n\nPart of the achievement \u2014 the Rays had the lowest team ERA in the American League \u2014 was pitching their way into the playoffs with shortened seasons from Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow. By the end of September, both were pitching, and generally pitching well, but limited in their innings. One, probably Glasnow, will get the start Friday against Verlander. Snell, the reigning Cy Young Award winner, gets Saturday and Cole.\n\n\u201cWhat they did in the course of the regular season,\u201d Chaim Bloom, the club\u2019s senior vice president, baseball operations, said of the Astros, \u201cthey\u2019ve earned the right to be favorites. People can call them that.\u201d\n\nAnd outfielder Tommy Pham added, \u201cThey\u2019re good. And everyone is ready for the moment.\u201d\n\nFirst, though, Pham took one last look back at what they\u2019d done together, not over six or seven months, but over three hours. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy. But it was going to be a helluva time. The job was going to be big. And aren\u2019t they always. It\u2019s what\u2019s different about being a Tampa Bay Ray. What\u2019s great about it.\n\n\u201cThat was pretty cool, huh?\u201d Pham said. \u201cBut I\u2019m from Vegas. I already like the lights and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Tampa Bay Rays are ready for the big job of facing the Houston Astros after topping the Oakland A's.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Hf.QQl7D.iAIzPe58XDgaA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m5nrO78pC4rfYEn7mf7jwA--~B/aD0yOTE3O3c9NDM3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/2bac7330-e5a4-11e9-b7fe-73f45045ad22"}
