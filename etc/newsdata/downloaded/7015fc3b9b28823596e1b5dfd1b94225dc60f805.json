The new image from Planet Labs, Inc., shows smoking craters in decimated areas that were previously covered in green foliage and forest.\n\nThe bombing was meant to destroy an area the Islamic State (ISIS) terror group was using for operations in the region, U.S. officials said. Iraqi forces searched and cleared the area following the bombing.\n\nWim Zwijnenburg, a senior researcher at PAX, a Dutch nongovernmental organization specializing in conflict and the environment, told Fox News that historical images show the island doesn\u2019t have any structures, indicating it\u2019s unlikely there are underground facilities.\n\nZwijnenburg said the island, on the Tigris River south of Mosul, has been targeted in the past. The nearest U.S. military presence is at Qayyarah Airfield West, about 10 miles away; it's occupied by the U.S.-led coalition battling the terrorist group.\n\nRoughly a dozen terrorists were killed in a previous airstrike on the island, Col. Myles B. Caggins III, spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), told Fox News on Thursday.\n\nA spokesperson for the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) told Business Insider that some 25 ISIS fighters were killed on the island, which they used \u201clike a hotel\u201d when traveling from Syria to Iraq. U.S. officials have also said the island is a \u201cmajor transit hub\u201d for ISIS fighters in and out of Syria.\n\nJIHADIS CELEBRATE 9/11 ANNIVERSARY, VOW TO STRIKE AMERICA AGAIN\n\nU.S. officials said F-15 and F-35 jets dropped the bombs. Caggins said GBU-31 munitions were dropped.\n\n\u201cThe coalition applies rigorous standards to our targeting process and takes extraordinary efforts to protect noncombatants,\u201d Caggins said, adding that Iraqi Special Forces inspected and cleared the area following the bombing.\n\nISIS USING BOOBY-TRAPPED BOVINES TO GO AFTER ENEMIES IN IRAQ, REPORTS SAY\n\n\"Follow-on ground clearance operations were conducted by the 2nd Iraqi Special Operations Forces Battalion to dismantle a major transit hub for Daesh [ISIS] members moving from Syria and the Jazeera desert into Mosul, Makhmour and the Kirkuk region,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThis airstrike denied ISIS terrain and hiding areas for smuggling lethal aid and fighters,\" he added. \"The strikes enabled the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service\u2019s ground clearance operation on Qanus Island.\"\n\nU.S. jets have doubled the number of airstrikes targeting ISIS in the past month, according to new U.S. Air Force strike data. American jets have dropped 28 percent more bombs on the Taliban and an ISIS affiliate in August than they did in the previous month.\n\nIn August, 800 bombs were dropped against targets in Afghanistan \u2013 the most since November 2018.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Thursday why an F-35 fighter would be used in this week's attack. \u201cI have real concerns about using a fifth-generation [F-35 stealth] aircraft to strike a bunch of terrorists hiding in the bushes,\u201d he said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.\n\nU.S. military officials say operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan could ramp up after the militant group claimed responsibility for two recent bombings in Kabul that killed dozens, including an American soldier. President Trump canceled planned high-level meetings this past weekend at Camp David with the Taliban and Afghan government over the attacks.\n\nFox News\u2019 Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.", "description": "A satellite image taken this week shows the aftermath of a massive U.S. bombing campaign against an\u00a0\u201cISIS-infested\u201d island in northern Iraq.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/island-before-after.jpg"}
