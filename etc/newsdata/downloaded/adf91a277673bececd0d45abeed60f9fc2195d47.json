REUTERS/Toby Melville/Files\n\nBritain\u2019s so-called \u2018Big Six\u2019 energy suppliers - Centrica\u2019s British Gas, E.ON, SSE, EDF\u2019s EDF Energy, Innogy\u2019s npower and Iberdrola\u2019s Scottish Power - have faced competition from more than 60 smaller firms, often offering cheaper prices.\n\nIn its annual state of the market report, Ofgem said the six companies had lost around 1.3 million customers and they served just above 70% of domestic customers as of June this year, down from around 75% in June last year.\n\nTotal domestic supply profits across the six largest firms, measured as earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), fell by 35% last year to 599 million pounds from 924 million pounds a year earlier. Profits fell 10% last year.\n\nTheir overall average profit margin, measured by EBIT as a percentage of revenue, fell to a nine-year low of 2.7%.\n\nHowever, profit margins varied across the six companies.\n\nBritish Gas had the highest at 7%. Scottish Power\u2019s was at more than 4% last year, up from just above 0% in 2017.\n\nEDF Energy\u2019s profit margin also rose to nearly 2% from 0.9% a year earlier. E.ON\u2019s profit margin fell to below 0% from above 5% a year earlier, and npower had the lowest profit margin at nearly -4%.\n\nThe difference in margins is usually due to varying operating costs and the extent to which costs were passed onto customers.\n\nRelative newcomer Ovo Energy is set to become one of the Big Six after striking a 500 million pound deal to buy SSE\u2019s retail arm last month.\n\nE.ON is buying npower from peer Innogy but both have said they would look at all options for the business, leaving room for a sale, restructuring or winding it down.\n\nOfgem said energy bills are one of the largest single items of regular expenditure in Britain. Households and businesses together spend around 55 billion pounds a year on energy.\n\nThe average dual fuel energy bill for a typical customer with the large suppliers in 2018 was 1,184 pounds, up from 1,117 the year earlier.\n\nFollowing government legislation, the regulator introduced a cap on energy prices for around 11 million customers on expensive default energy deals in January and estimates it has saved them around 1 billion pounds this year.\n\nOfgem added that it is still investigating an outage which disconnected 1.1 million electricity customers in August and will report on the causes in next year\u2019s report.", "description": "Profits from supplying gas and electricity at Britain\u2019s big six energy firms sank by a combined 35 percent last year as they continued to lose customers to smaller rivals, a report by energy market regulator Ofgem said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Nina Chestney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436571873&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920L1"}
