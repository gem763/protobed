(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nA powerful storm has formed in the Atlantic, threatening Florida and parts of the Bahamas. But another one formed on Twitter this week, after a former Canadian prime minister tweeted that she hoped Hurricane Dorian would strike President Trump\u2019s resort in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nForecasters are closely watching Dorian, which could potentially strike the east coast of Florida early Tuesday as a Category 4 hurricane. But in a since-deleted tweet, former Canadian prime minister Kim Campbell responded to news of the threat by exclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m rooting for a direct hit on Mar a Lago!\u201d\n\n[Hurricane Dorian is not your typical Florida tropical cyclone]\n\nThe next day, she said that she wished it would \"shake up Trump\u2019s climate change denial!\u201d\n\nWell, we will see if Mrs. Post\u2019s design can stand up to the assault! I know Palm Beach well and am sorry if it gets a big hit. I wish I cd believe that it wd shake up Trump\u2019s climate change denial! Only today his admin has removed regs to limit methane- a worse GHG than CO2! https://t.co/zwkv87Exec \u2014 Kim Campbell (@AKimCampbell) August 30, 2019\n\nOn Friday, Campbell deleted the original message about Mar-a-Lago taking a hit, two days after it was initially posted and apologized \u201cto all it offended.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shd know better,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMea culpa.\u201d\n\nI have deleted my tweet about the hurricane & Mar a Lago and sincerely apologize to all it offended. It was intended as sarcasm-not a serious wish of harm. Throwaway lines get a life of their own on Twitter. I shd know better. Mea culpa. \u2014 Kim Campbell (@AKimCampbell) August 30, 2019\n\nTwitter users both vilified and defended Campbell for her original remark, with some interpreting it as sarcasm while others believed it was an unfair attack on the U.S. president.\n\nHer Wednesday tweet is not the first time she has used the platform to criticize Trump. At the beginning of the year, Campbell called Trump a profane name on Twitter but also deleted that tweet.\n\nCampbell was the first and only woman to serve as Canada\u2019s prime minister, but she did not hold the position for long. She assumed power in June 1993 only to lose it that November. All told, she spent 132 days in the office.\n\n\u201cCampbell is known for having a tongue with a mind of its own, and thus far she has not tried to tame it,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Charles Truehart wrote in 1993 as Campbell sought the prime minister\u2019s office. She currently chairs the advisory board that recommends Supreme Court appointees to the prime minister, currently Justin Trudeau.\n\nTwitter maelstroms aside, Dorian poses a serious threat to Florida residents. The storm is \u201cpredicted to remain a dangerous hurricane throughout the remainder of the forecast period,\u201d the National Hurricane Center warned in a Thursday night bulletin.\n\nIf Dorian strengthens to a Category 4 hurricane, it will be capable of inflicting \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d with winds that can reach more than 150 mph.\n\nIn such a storm, \u201cwell-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls,\u201d according to the National Hurricane Center. \u201cMost trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\u201d\n\nTrump on Friday said \u201cit would look like Mar-A-Lago is dead center\u201d of the hurricane\u2019s path, adding that the resort can handle itself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very powerful place,\u201d he said in response to a reporter question before leaving for Camp David. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m worried about is the state of Florida. Because this could be a record-setting hurricane.\u201d\n\nThe president canceled a trip to Poland and will remain in the United States as the storm arrives. On Thursday, Trump tweeted a video message that issued a warning to Americans.\n\n\n\nThe National Hurricane Center's latest outlook brings Hurricane Dorian to Florida, or just offshore, as a Category 4 storm. (NOAA/NWS/NHC)\n\n\u201cThe winds seem to be building at a tremendous rate. It looks like the winds are going to be unbelievably high,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll get lucky, but it looks to me that this time it\u2019s heading in one direction; all indications are it\u2019s going to hit very hard, and it\u2019s going to be very big.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHurricane Dorian: Florida on guard for potential major hurricane strike\n\n\u2018Absolute monster:\u2019 Trump gives Hurricane Dorian weather forecast\n\nStudy: Hurricane Maria and its aftermath caused a spike of nearly 3,000 deaths in Puerto Rico\n\nUnpaid workers and complaints of shoddy construction plague hurricane recovery on U.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\u2018Harvey Homeless:\u2019 A year after hurricane inundated Texas, effects linger because many can\u2019t afford repairs", "description": "Kim Campbell has deleted the tweet and apologized.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EQJXoDcKNqdiUOWZ7atY6zuK21c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6DSFGTWLGYI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg"}
