Farrah Fawcett wore them. 1970s basketball players wore them. The Red Hot Chili Peppers \u2026 wore them. And in the past couple years, you may have noticed the classic, chunky white socks with bright-colored stripes on the ankles of Bella Hadid, Justin Bieber, and Instagram models aplenty. Like other \u201980s and \u201990s favorites \u2014 including hair clips, scrunchies, and flip-flops \u2014 the socks have been having a moment.\n\nRecently, though, we\u2019ve been noticing new takes on the gym-class favorite. The latest tube socks come in subdued shades, sheer nylons, and shimmery Lurex blends that you could just as easily wear with a pair of dressy pants to work as you could with sneakers or heels. We noticed chunky multicolor iterations at Prada\u2019s Resort 2020 show, and some thick bright ones in Versace\u2019s Fall 2019 collection. They\u2019ve been popping up on the \u201cSocks and Tights\u201d page of plenty of sites, from Need Supply to Totakealo. And earlier this week, we scrolled past a gray and yellow pair styled with heels on Rachel Comey\u2019s Instagram. So to ease the pain of putting away all things open-toe, we\u2019ve rounded up some of our favorites \u2014 including ones that you could wear with summer sandals to make them a little more fall-feeling. Here are our picks.\n\nCalzitaly Oldschool Striped Calf Socks This three-pack of very \u201970s tube socks from Italian hosiery brand Calzitaly seems like a good starter pack for getting into the look. $18 for 3 at Amazon Buy $18 for 3 at Amazon Buy\n\nGLENMEARL Merino Wool Crew Socks This two-pack comes with a red-striped pair and a black-striped pair \u2014 perfect for when you go on that inevitable upstate hike with friends this fall. $19 for 2 at Amazon Buy $19 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nMidify Soccer Socks $10 (was $20, now 50% off) If you want to go full-on varsity (or Gossip Girl-esque school uniform, as the product images suggest) you could try these, which come in about a gazillion different colors. $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\n& Other Stories Sheer Varsity Ankle Socks Other Stories has a bunch of fun varsity ankle socks right now, including these sheer ones, with a citrusy stripe combo. $9 at & Other Stories Buy\n\n& Other Stories Glitter Varsity Stripe Socks They also have a polka-dot glitter pair. $9 at & Other Stories Buy\n\nPhoto: Reid, Hilary & Other Stories Ribbed Varsity Glitter Socks And an even more glittery pair that\u2019s a twist on classic white tube socks with colorful stripes. $9 at & Other Stories Buy\n\nMadewell Ribbed Athletic Tube Socks Madewell has a pair of tube socks in a nice, autumnal deep marigold shade. $11 at Madewell Buy\n\nCOS Sheer-Stripe Ankle Socks The second stripe on these is sheer, and we think they\u2019d make a good pair to wear in the early days of fall when it\u2019s still pretty hot. $9 at COS Buy\n\nUrban Outfitters Out From Under Multi-Striped Crew Sock Urban Outfitters has plenty of striped socks on offer recently, and this multipack would be a perfect way to refresh your everyday socks while still getting in on the trend. $12 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nAdidas Mid-Cut Crew Three-pack Socks It wouldn\u2019t be a round up of gym socks, without some Adidas ones.
