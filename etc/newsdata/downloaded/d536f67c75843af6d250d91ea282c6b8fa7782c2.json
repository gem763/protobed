However, abortion was decriminalized in Northern Ireland at midnight on Monday.\n\nIn a statement after the ruling, the woman said her emotions \u201cwere all over the place.\u201d\n\nPA Archive/PA Images Pro-choice campaigners outside Belfast's Crown and High Courts.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in six years I can go back to being the mother I was, without the weight of this hanging over me every minute of every day and I can finally move on with my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so thankful that the change in the law will allow other women and girls to deal with matters like this privately in their own family circle.\u201d\n\nHer solicitor Jemma Conlon, of Chambers Solicitors, added: \u201cToday is a day of immense relief for my client, who now finds herself free from the burden of this prosecution that has been in her life for six years.\n\n\u201cIt is a day that she will forever remember and a day that allows her to finally move on with her life privately without anguish and criminalization.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in six years I can go back to being the mother I was, without the weight of this hanging over me every minute of every day and I can finally move on with my life.\n\nMeanwhile, Grainne Teggart from Amnesty International, which had been supporting the woman, said the outcome was evidence of a new \u201ccompassionate\u201d legal framework in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cToday we are relieved that she can go back to being a mother,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing today is our new abortion law taking effect. No longer will women be hauled through the courts and treated as criminals for accessing this healthcare service.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of a new era for Northern Ireland \u2013 a more caring and compassionate Northern Ireland.
