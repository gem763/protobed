Photo: USA Today\n\nLast week, a Kentucky reporter was caught off guard when a man she didn\u2019t know interrupted her live TV segment and kissed her on the cheek, instantly making her uncomfortable. The man, who has since been identified and apologized, is now facing harassment charges.\n\nOn September 20, WAVE 3 reporter Sara Rivest was just starting her live broadcast from Louisville\u2019s Bourbon & Beyond music festival at the Kentucky Exposition Center when a man wearing sunglasses started to approach her. In the segment, which has since gone viral, the man moves behind Rivest, where he pretends to slap her butt \u2014 a gesture that\u2019s out of her line of sight. Then, mere seconds later, he walks up to her and kisses her on the cheek while she\u2019s talking, and then quickly runs off. \u201cOkay, that was not appropriate,\u201d Rivest says to the camera, then emits a few nervous laughs and attempts to continue reporting. Later in the segment, when WAVE anchor John Boel asks her if she\u2019s okay, she replies, keeping her composure, that she \u201cmight need some help.\u201d\n\nHey mister, here\u2019s your 3 seconds of fame. How about you not touch me? Thanks!! pic.twitter.com/5O44fu4i7y \u2014 Sara Rivest (@SRivestWAVE3) September 20, 2019\n\nOn September 26, Louisville Metro Police announced that they had identified the man as Eric Goodman, and that he is facing a misdemeanor charge of harassment with physical contact, the Louisville Courier Journal reports. The same day, Rivest also wrote on Twitter that Goodman had sent her an apology letter, which she went on to read on air. In the letter, Goodman attempts to explain the motives behind his actions \u2014 that he was at a bachelor party, and that he was simply trying to be funny \u2014 but also stresses that he takes full responsibility for his inappropriate behavior.\n\n\u201cI was wrong to interrupt your job, invade your personal space and leave you feeling powerless,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cRegardless, your ability to maintain a professional composure speaks volume of your strength.\u201d\n\nHey mister, here\u2019s your 3 seconds of fame. How about you not touch me?

So I also agree with the commonwealth\u2019s decision in this case.\u201d\n\nGoodman is scheduled to appear in court on November 6.", "description": "During a live broadcast, Kentucky reporter Sara Rivest was caught off guard when a strange man kissed her and pretended the slap her but.
