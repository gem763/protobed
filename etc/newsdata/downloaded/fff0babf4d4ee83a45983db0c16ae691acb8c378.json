One of the questions asks respondents what their country of birth is. The Census Bureau pooled together survey responses from between 2013 and 2017, allowing the bureau\u2019s statisticians to publish estimates of how many people in the foreign-born populations of each state and the District of Columbia came from various countries.\n\nThe percentage of the population born outside the US varies widely from state to state. Among those immigrant populations, countries of origin also vary widely.\n\nFor 32 states, the most common country of birth among respondents who said they were born outside the US was Mexico. Therefore, the map above looks at the country other than Mexico that is the birthplace of the most foreign-born respondents in the survey.\n\nIndia tops that list in 21 states. Several states have Canada as a major source of immigrants. Several Asian, African, and Central American countries also have large immigrant populations in various states.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
