Elizabeth Warren, and also promised to stay quiet the Hong Kong protests as long as trade talks progressed, CNN reported on Thursday, citing two people familiar with the conversation.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.

Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nA transcript of the call between them was stored in a highly secured electronic system, CNN said, which was also used to log a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDuring this call, Trump repeatedly pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son ahead of the 2020 election. Biden is a frontrunner in the Democratic nomination for the presidency.\n\nRead more: The White House 'lockdown' of Trump's call with Ukraine looks like part of a bigger, worrying pattern\n\nThe Financial Times had also reported in July that Trump promised to mute support for the anti-China movement in Hong Kong in exchange for re-opening trade talks. It's not clear if the two outlets were reporting on the same conversation.\n\nUS-China trade negotiations remain deadlocked, with the US reading a 30% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods later this month.\n\nProtesters walking through tear gas smoke in Hong Kong on August 4, 2019.

CNN said it was unclear if China would be launching an investigation, or if they would publicize such a move.\n\n\"This is quite chaotic,\" a Chinese diplomat told CNN. \"We do not want to get in the middle of the US politics.\"\n\nRead more: Newly revealed text messages show Trump diplomats' internal turmoil over his pressure on Ukraine\n\nTrump on the phone with Saudi King Salman Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud in the White House in January 2017.

Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nBut Trump offered some sort of defense of the protests in a speech at the UN last month, in which he called on China to protect Hong Kong's freedoms.\n\n\"How China chooses to handle this situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future,\" he said. \"We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader.\"", "description": "The US president has offered a muted response to the protests, despite global backlash over China's encroachment in the semi-autonomous city.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d56b8afcd97841560171d48?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
