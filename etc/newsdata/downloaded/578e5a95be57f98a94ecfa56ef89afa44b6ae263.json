If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY's newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nGift shopping is hard. No matter if you\u2019re shopping for a sibling, a longtime spouse, or a co-worker, the act of picking out the perfect gift can be overwhelming. What does she want? What doesn\u2019t she already own? What color would she want it in? Is she allergic to anything? Does she like to read? What is her favorite scent? So many questions, so little time to buy.\n\nTo reduce your gift shopping stress (and stress in general) this holiday shopping season, we\u2019ve come up with a list of 25 awesome gifts for all the different types of women in your life. From the home chef to the traveler to the one you don\u2019t know that well, we have you covered. Here are Reviewed's picks for the gifts women want in 2019, including the best stuff we've tested this year, top-rated popular items, and things I personally own and recommend.\n\n1. For the home chef: Staub Dutch Oven\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Staub Dutch Oven (Photo: Staub)\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of, seen, or owned a Le Creuset dutch oven. They are one of the most popular wedding gifts for newlyweds and, like KitchenAid stand mixers, a kitchen staple for adults everywhere. However, when we tested dutch ovens at Reviewed, our favorite overall was not Le Creuset\u2014it was Staub! We're not the only ones loving Staub. Their cookware all over food blogs and Instagram. Clearly these dutch ovens are hot right now, so get them for the person in your life who loves cooking. If you're stuck on color, I recommend the black and cherry red. I own Staub cookware in both colors and love them.\n\nGet the Staub Cast Iron 5.5 Quart Round Cocotte on Amazon starting at $324.95\n\n2. For the fitness fanatic: Yoga Pants\n\nBest gifts for women of 2019: Yoga Pants (Photo: Lululemon and Nordstrom)\n\nI swear by both Lululemon and Zella yoga pants. My top favorite yoga pants for everything are Lululemon's Wunder Under pants. Whether I\u2019m lounging on the couch, taking a barre class, or sweating profusely in spin class, these high-waisted yoga pants are game-changers. No camel toe. No sweating through the pants. No itching from discomfort. These yogas are definitely worth the price tag. My other favorite yoga pants from Lululemon are the Align Pant. Better for low impact workouts and lounging, they are pretty much like sweatpants. By far, the most comfortable yoga pants I've ever owned. My third favorite is Nordstrom's fitness brand Zella's less pricier leggings. With over 6,300 nearly perfect reviews, it's not just me who loves them.\n\n3. For the homebody: UGG Slippers\n\nBest gifts for women of 2019: Ugg Slippers (Photo: Nordstrom and Ugg)\n\nUggs have been around for years, and although the boots may have fallen from fashion grace years ago, the slippers never went out of style. After all, Uggs are comfortable. With thousands of four to five star reviews on Nordstrom's Ugg slipper listings, it is clear that the people agree. The Ansley Water Resistant Slippers are perfect for the simple, comfortable one who would wear these shoes inside and outside of the home, and the Scuffette II Slippers are great for the one who would probably just wear these at home. Speaking from experience, you can\u2019t go wrong with UGG slippers as a gift. In the past six years, I have given a different pair of UGG slippers to my mom, grandmother, grandfather, fianc\u00e9, and brothers \u2013 and each time, they were a hit.\n\n4. For the book lover: The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Kindle Paperwhite (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThe book lover may already have a Kindle, but who doesn\u2019t enjoy the latest and greatest technology the world has to offer? This is the best Kindle we've tested and over 12,000 reviewers on Amazon agree. Now waterproof with two times the storage, this is a perfect gift for anyone who likes to read.\n\nGet the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite on Amazon for $109.99\n\n5. For the one who likes being comfortable: Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Cardigan\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Barefoot Dreams Cardigan (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nThis cardigan has over 2,600 reviews on Nordstrom and a 5-star rating. I own this myself and can confirm it is like a comfortable blanket disguised as clothing. When it comes to cardigans and sweaters, the limit does not exist for the amount one can own. They make great gifts\u2014especially when they\u2019re this cozy (and chic). Not shopping for a cardigan person? Barefoot Dreams also sells a robe. Just saying...\n\nGet the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Cardigan from Nordstrom for $116\n\n6. For the music lover: The best portable bluetooth speaker\n\nBest gifts for women of 2019: JBL Flip 4 (Photo: Reviewed/Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nIf she loves listening to music, consider getting her the Editor's Choice award winning JBL Flip 4 speaker. It is by far the best bluetooth speaker we've tested, and it's both portable and waterproof, so she can bring it and use it anywhere. A portable speaker is always great to have, and even if she might already have one, replacing old tech gadgets with new ones is always a welcome idea.\n\nGet the JBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker on Amazon for $89.95\n\n7. For the one who loves to travel: Away\u2019s The Carry-On\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Away's The Carry-On (Photo: Away)\n\nYou've probably seen this trendy luggage on Instagram, as it is a travel blogger favorite. The brand is also one of our favorites here at Reviewed. When we tested checked luggage, Away won as our best hard-sided suitcase, and one of our writers swears by her carry-on. It comes in nine different colors and looks much different than your average carry-on. My personal favorite is the blush color. If you don\u2019t want to splurge on a suitcase as a gift for the traveler, consider a duffle bag instead. Sole Society\u2019s Faux Leather Weekend Bag is a perfect, inexpensive option for the trendy traveler. I own and love it.\n\nGet Away's The Carry-On from Away for $225\n\n8. For the wine lover: Corkcicle Insulated Stemless Glass\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Corkcicle Wine Tumbler (Photo: Corkcicle)\n\nThis is a perfect gift for the wine drinker on-the-go. I\u2019m just kidding. This is actually great for ALL wine drinkers\u2014not just busy ones. Keep her glass full AND cold this season with Corkcicle\u2019s stylish stemless wine thermos (that is a mouthful\u2014no pun intended). It comes in many colors including one called \u201cUnicorn Magic.\u201d Now please excuse me while I purchase this in advance of the holidays, so I can attend all of my upcoming parties with it. Meet my new plus one: the Corkcicle wine glass.\n\nGet the Corkcicle Insulated Stemless Wine Glass on Amazon for $22.95\n\n9. For the binge-watcher: Roku Ultra\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Roku Ultra (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThe Roku Ultra (2018 edition) is our favorite streaming device of 2019. If you know someone who is addicted to binging television shows, enhance their Netflix viewing experience for the holidays. Cold weather is coming. What more could they want?!\n\nGet the Roku Ultra (2018) on Amazon for $89.94\n\n10. For the health nut: Skinnytaste Cookbooks\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Skinnytaste Cookbook (Photo: Skinnytaste)\n\nI almost exclusively cook recipes from the Skinnytaste website and cookbooks. As a longtime follower of Gina Homolka's blog, I can confirm the recipes are both healthy and amazing. Any of her cookbooks would make for a great gift alone, together, or with a kitchen gadget or small appliance that can be used with the cookbook.\n\n11. For the bag lady: Madewell Leather Transport Tote\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Madewell Transport Tote (Photo: Madewell, Nordstrom)\n\nI had my eyes on Madewell's classic leather tote bag for a long time, so I did not hesitate to purchase it when they came out with a zip top version of it last year. After owning the bag for a year, I can safely recommend it as a great gift. The classic tote is big enough to hold all my stuff for work, stylish enough for me to use on weekends when I don't have a lot in it, and the zip top makes it perfect for traveling on weekend trips with (or using as a carry-on while flying). The bag comes in a few different colors. I have it in English Saddle, which is the color I recommend.\n\nGet the Madewell Zip Top Transport Leather Tote from Nordstrom for $188\n\n12. For the runner: Garmin Forerunner 245 Running Watch\n\nBest gifts for women of 2019: Garmin 245 (Photo: Reviewed/Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nWe tested running watches this year, and the Garmin Forerunner 245 took the top spot as the best one and won an Editor's Choice award. Whether she's training for her 10th marathon or casually enjoys running, this watch would be welcomed with open arms\u2014I mean wrists.\n\nGet the Garmin Forerunner 245 Running Watch on Amazon for $339\n\n13. For the nostalgic one: Fujifilm Instax Mini 9\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Fujifilm Instax Mini 9 (Photo: Amazon)\n\nHow cute is this camera?! This is a great gift for people who love taking pictures and HAVING pictures. I bought and used the Instax Mini 9 at my wedding this year for guests to take photos of themselves. A friend also had the camera while we were traveling in Greece this summer, and I have some of those pictures hanging on my fridge. Great for adults, college students, and teens, this Fujifilm camera is an excellent gift.\n\nGet the Fujifilm Instax Mini 9 on Amazon for $53.63\n\n14. For the one who wants to upgrade from iPhone photography to actual photography: Panasonic Lumix LX100\n\nBest gifts for women of 2019: Lumix Camera (Photo: Lumix)\n\nRecommended by one of our tech experts, this camera is perfect for beginners. If she\u2019s pretty good at smartphone photography, consider giving the gift of real photography this year. Though there is an updated model, the LX100 is still a great choice given the price.\n\nGet the Pansonic Lumix LX100 on Amazon for $597.99\n\n15. For the home entertainer: Capri Blue Volcano Jar Candle\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Capri Blue Candle (Photo: Anthropologie)\n\nIf she loves home d\u00e9cor and entertaining guests, you can never go wrong with a candle as a gift. My favorite candle by far is Capri Blue\u2019s Volcano scent. Not only do they smell amazing, but they come in chic jars that double as amazing home decor. Anthropologie sells tons of styles for Capri Blue candles (some even holiday themed), but my go-to's are the jar candles in blue and white. I have them all over my home.\n\nGet the Capri Blue Volcano Jar Candle from Anthropologie for $30\n\n16. For the coffee lover: The Technivorm Moccamaster Coffee Brewer\n\nBest gifts for women of 2019: Moccamaster (Photo: Moccamaster/Facebook)\n\nHere at Reviewed, we've tested all sorts of coffee makers.

Because of this, we can safely say if you're looking to splurge on someone who loves their coffee, look no further than the best drip coffee maker, the Moccamaster. Not only does it make a great cup of coffee, its mid-century, retro design looks fantastic on countertops. Not sure she'll love the Moccamaster or looking for something a little more affordable?

La Mer moisturizing cream has OVER 60,000 hearts at Sephora and over 1,800 reviews at Nordstrom with a 5-star rating. That is a lot of love. Why not spread it?

For the one who hates jeans: Madewell Jeans\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Madewell Jeans (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nI thought I hated jeans until I discovered Madewell jeans. They\u2019re comfortable, they\u2019re slimming, they never rip, and they\u2019re a great price. Madewell also has sizes for all\u2014petite, tall, curvy, etc. If you're not sure what kind to get, I recommend a classic 10-inch (not too low waisted, but not too high) in a solid color dark wash, like Hayes Wash. These are my go-to every day jeans. Read more about my thoughts on Madewell jeans here.\n\nGet the Madewell 10-Inch High-Rise Skinny Jeans from Nordstrom for $128\n\n20. For the simple one: Kate Spade pendant necklace\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Kate Spade Pendant Necklace (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nBefore you follow my recommendation for this gift, please think about the person you\u2019re shopping for first. If they are particular about what they wear, you may want to hold off on buying them jewelry without knowing what they want (Cue: The List\u2014In other words, have them write you a list of things they want and FOLLOW IT). However, if the person you\u2019re shopping for is simple and timeless, this Kate Spade pendant necklace could be perfect. It can be dressed up or down and is personalized with the initial of their first name displayed in the pendant. This necklace has 850 reviews with a 5-star rating, so people clearly love it. Not to mention, necklaces with initials on them are on-trend right now.\n\nGet the Kate Spade New York one in a million initial pendant necklace from Nordstrom for $58\n\n21. For the trendy one: Rent the Runway membership\n\nBest gifts for women of 2019: Rent the Runway Unlimited (Photo: Rent the Runway)\n\nRent the Runway's Unlimited service is a great gift for a number of reasons. First, it's perfect for fashionistas who loves wearing new clothes, but don't have unlimited funds to buy new clothes all the time. Second, it's great if you have a lot of events or weddings coming up, because you can rent clothes for them, rather than buy. And third, it helps if you have to look nice every day for work. If you know someone who who love a designer closet without the price tag or commitment, give them the gift of Rent the Runway. I've been an Unlimited member for almost three years now, and it has truly been a game-changer for me.\n\nGet a Rent the Runway Unlimited subscription for $159/month (or $80 off a 60 day trial)\n\n22. For the planner: A 2020 Planner\n\nBest gifts for women of 2019: 2020 Planners (Photo: Anthropologie)\n\nIf you know someone who is a planner, why not give them the gift of a planner? Whether they already use a planner or not, the one with all the plans could use a place to jot down everything down. These cute planners from ban.do, Anthropologie, and Rifle Paper Co. are fantastic options. The gold ban.do planner is plain, but also slightly fancy. The Anthropologie planner is art-deco themed for the return of the roaring '20s, making it perfect for those who are artsy and chic. And the Rifle Paper Co. planner is classic for those who love stationery and florals.\n\n23. For the one who is always smiling: Sugarfina Champagne Bears Candy Cube\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Sugarfina Champagne Bears (Photo: Sugarfina)\n\nSugarfina candies are not like regular candies. They are cool candies. But really. With flavors such as bourbon, ros\u00e9, and champagne, it doesn't get much more fancy than this. Last year, I gave my bridesmaids these candy cubes as a gift and everyone loved them (including me). They are an adorable, inexpensive gift.\n\nGet the Sugarfina Baby Champagne Bears Large Candy Cube from Nordstrom for $20\n\n24. For the picky one: Gift Cards\n\nBest gifts for women 2019: Gift Cards (Photo: Amazon)\n\nShopping for some people can be hard. I get it. I am that person who is hard to shop for. I expect people to read my mind and know what I want without me having to tell them. Being this type of person, I can tell you first hand that GIFT CARDS are the way to go. I love a good gift card. Spending money is my favorite hobby, and if you know someone like me, I guarantee you they will love the gift of spending someone else's money. Here are some great gift card options (take notes people who get me gifts, I'm just kidding, no one buys me gifts, but in a perfect world this is what I would want).\n\n25. For the one you have no idea what to buy: Sephora Favorites Holiday Perfume Sampler\n\nBest gifts for women of 2019: Sephora Perfume Sampler (Photo: Sephora)\n\nIf you ever get stumped on what to give your wife, sister, girlfriend, mom, friend, etc, my go-to gift recommendation for all women is a Sephora perfume sampler. Ten years ago or so, my grandmother bought me this as a gift and it honestly changed my life. I knew nothing about perfume, but I was able to dabble in a few best-sellers thanks to this kit. When I was done, I picked my favorite and redeemed the coupon in the gift set for a full-sized bottle of it. Even now that I know about perfume, I would still welcome this gift, as its not every day I get to try new fragrances.\n\nGet the Sephora Favorites Holiday Perfume Sampler from Sephora for $65 ($111 value)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2017/11/13/25-amazing-gifts-women-actually-want/107666244/", "description": "From UGG slippers to Kindles to cozy (and chic) cardigans, these are 2019's best gift ideas for the women in your life.
