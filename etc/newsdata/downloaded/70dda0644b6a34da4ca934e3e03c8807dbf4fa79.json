From six-week lows just two weeks ago, arabica coffee on ICE Futures U.S. has gained over 6% in three straight sessions, catapulting the commodity to near three-week highs.\n\nArabica 300 Minute Chart\n\nFavorable technical action, along with early inclement weather and tree stress \u2014 the two things that could restrain top arabica grower Brazil from a bumper crop this year \u2014 are driving the rally.\n\nA Tale Of Two Coffees\n\nProving not all coffee beans were the same, however, is struggling to get into an even rally. Grown largely in Vietnam and traded on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, or LIFFE, futures of robusta have settled up only twice in the last six sessions, with no milestones to show.\n\nLondon Robusta 300 Minute Chart\n\nJack Scoville, author of Chicago brokerage Price Futures Group\u2019s daily coffee and other soft commodity reports, notes how the diverging trends in arabica and robusta could play to the fortunes of coffee bulls and bears:\n\n\u201cTrends in New York are turning up while trends in London are still mostly down.\u201d\n\nScoville says the recent run-up in Brazil\u2019s was another factor in arabica\u2019s favor, given the considerable influence the currency had on ex-farm prices of Brazilian commodities. The real started to appreciate against the U.S. dollar as Brazil\u2019s coffee cooperative Cooxupe said it had sold most if not all of its previous crop supplies.\n\nWeather played a role too. Reports of good flowering and strong crop expectations in Brazil were offset by some extreme cold and drought conditions earlier in the year that Scoville said might have stressed trees and could hurt production potential for the full year.\n\nArabica Flips To Positive, Seen As \u201cStrong Buy\u201d\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s session on New York\u2019s ICE, arabica\u2019s front-month December contract settled at 98.90 cents a lb, up 3.3% week-to-date after a 2.1% gain the prior week. Year-to-date though, it was down almost 3%, accounting for losses from earlier in the year.\n\nThe upside trend set now by arabica seemed in line with the predictions laid out by J.P.Morgan:\n\n\u201cArabica coffee markets may be prone to an imminent switch in signal, from negative to positive. The impact of trend following models should not be underestimated in agricultural markets.\u201d\n\nEric Scoles, commodity markest strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, said trend-following Commodity Trading Advisors were holding a heavy net-short in arabica, \u201cwhich offers an abundance of short covering fuel to sustain rising prices should the global sentiment remain optimistic.\u201d Adds Scoles:\n\n\u201cCalendar spreads have also been rapidly becoming less negative which is a good sign that the supply/demand dynamic is shifting to bullish.\u201d \u201cWhile positive weather factors for next years crop had presented managed money funds an opportunity to sell short and try to press prices down further, the conversation should start changing to near term fundamentals.\u201d\n\nInvesting.com\u2019s Daily Technical Outlook rates arabica as a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d predicting a top-end resistance of 99.90 cents per lb. It also notes that arabica had smashed past most price barriers set in recent days, and was now trading above its 200-Day Moving Average. According to Scoles:\n\n\u201cIf news continues coming out bullish and we see a tighter supply situation, arabica could be high performer for bulls.\u201d\n\nRobusta Rated A \u201cSell\u201d As Vietnam Remains Stuck With Unsold Bags\n\nIn robusta\u2019s case, the front-month January contract on LIFFE settled Tuesday\u2019s London trade at $1,216 a tonne, eking a 3% gain week-to-date after a near 9% drop accumulated over three weeks prior.\n\nInvesting.com\u2019s Daily Technical Outlook rates robusta as a \u201cSell,\u201d predicting a bottom-end support of $1,179 for the January contract. Said Scoville:\n\n\u201cVietnam crops are thought to be big despite some uneven growing conditions this year. It has been warm and dry at times, then the growing areas have seen some very heavy rains. Overall growing conditions are better now.\u201d\n\nHe said Vietnamese robusta exports also remain a year behind. \u201cThe market anticipates bigger offers as producers and traders will need to create new storage space. They are expected to do this by selling old crop coffee at lower prices.\u201d", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: USD/BRL, US Coffee C Futures, London Coffee Futures.
