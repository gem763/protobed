Baltimore batters have gone deep at least once in 18 straight games, two shy of the 1998 club record.\n\nWith one more victory or a loss by Detroit, the Orioles (51-106) can avoid having baseball\u2019s worst record for the second straight season.\n\nMancini, named AL Player of the Week on Monday, extended his hitting streak to 11 games. He doubled and scored in the first, doubled in the third, singled in the fifth, hit an RBI single in the sixth, and singled and scored in the eighth.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s impressive,\u201d Bundy said of Mancini\u2019s five-hit night. \u201cHe\u2019s tearing the cover off the ball right now.\u201d\n\nBundy (7-14) allowed two runs and three hits in seven innings to win for the first time since Aug. 25.\n\nManager Brandon Hyde said he was grateful for Bundy\u2019s strong effort, which came one day after the Orioles used 10 pitchers in a 15-inning loss.\n\n\u201cThere were so many guys, obviously, that I wanted to stay away from tonight,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cEven in September, we\u2019re a little bit short just because of the amount of pitchers we used last night and the workload they\u2019ve had recently.\u201d\n\nHyde intended to let Bundy work the eighth, but changed his mind after eight Orioles batters came to the plate in a lengthy top half of the inning. Lefty Tanner Scott worked the eighth and righty Taylor Scott finished.\n\nEven so, Hyde was still plenty grateful for Bundy\u2019s big night.\n\n\u201cHuge for us, huge for our bullpen,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cIt allows the bullpen guys to breathe and it allows the bullpen guys to get proper rest.\u201d\n\nBundy is 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA in four starts against Toronto. He threw 86 pitches, walked two and struck out six.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give him credit,\u201d Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. \u201cHe threw strikes with the lead and that\u2019s what you need to do when you have a lead.\u201d\n\nScheduled to make his fourth big league appearance, Blue Jays rookie left-hander Anthony Kay was scratched because of back soreness about two hours before the game and replaced by lefty Thomas Pannone.\n\nKay\u2019s injury was ill-timed for the Blue Jays, also thin in the bullpen after using 10 pitchers themselves Monday.\n\nBaltimore jumped on Pannone (3-6) with four hits and three runs in the first, his only inning of work. Renato Nu\u00f1ez hit a two-run double and Smith added an RBI single.\n\n\u201cIt was big for us to come back and respond today,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cFrom the first inning, we kind of set the tone.\u201d\n\nSmith and Wynns both hit solo homers off Wilmer Font in the fourth and Stewart connected off right-hander Brock Stewart in the sixth.\n\nBundy retired eight straight before Derek Fisher hit a two-out homer in the third, the record 300th home run off Baltimore pitching this season.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBlue Jays: SS Bo Bichette (concussion) missed his fifth straight game. Bichette left last Thursday\u2019s game at Baltimore after being hit on the helmet by a pitch.\n\nHE\u2019LL BE BACK?\n\nMontoyo said he hadn\u2019t decided whether Kay would be ruled out for the remainder of the season.\n\n\u201cHopefully he gets to pitch again,\u201d Montoyo said.\n\nFOUR FOR FIVE\n\nMancini\u2019s five-hit game was Baltimore\u2019s fourth of the season, matching a team record. The Orioles also had four five-hit games in 1966 and 1974.\n\nDOUBLED UP\n\nThe Orioles reached double figures in runs for the second straight game. It\u2019s the second time this season they\u2019ve done so. Baltimore also scored 10 or more June 28 and 29 against Cleveland.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOrioles: RHP Gabriel Ynoa (1-9, 5.65) has allowed six home runs in four September starts.\n\nBlue Jays: RHP Jacob Waguespack (4-5, 4.75) faces Baltimore for the first time. The rookie is winless in his past six outings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even with the season in its final week, and extra reinforcements on hand, the Baltimore Orioles' bullpen needed a break.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ian Harrison"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/orioles_blue_jays_baseball_10554_c0-331-3000-2080_s1770x1032.jpg?b45cd9cf9ec9fd333f617f9ac6134076409607b6", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
