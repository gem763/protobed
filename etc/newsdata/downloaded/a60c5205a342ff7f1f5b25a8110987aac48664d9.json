Physical activity can prevent fragility and support mobility in old age,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBy keeping active, both throughout the day and also through hobbies, we can slow muscle and bone decline, ultimately keeping us independent for longer.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, the guidelines also include information for pregnant women and people with disabilities.\n\nAdults with or without a disability can experience the same benefits from exercise, the guidelines say, adding that \u201cany myths about physical activity being inherently harmful for disabled people should be dispelled\u201d.\n\nExercise, including strength training, can also be safely recommended to women during and after pregnancy.\n\nThe benefits of exercise during pregnancy include reduced hypertension, improved cardiorespiratory fitness; lower gestational weight gain and a smaller risk of gestational diabetes.\n\nThe guidelines add that high intensity interval training (also known as HIIT) \u2013 short bursts of very vigorous activity interspersed with rest periods \u2013 can be as or more effective than moderate to vigorous exercise, but more research is needed to identify an optimal amount and form to recommend.\n\nEach week, adults should exercise at a moderate intensity for at least 150 minutes, at a vigorous intensity for 75, or at a very vigorous activity for even less time.\n\nPrevious advice that this should be undertaken in bouts of at least 10 minutes, spread out across most days of the week, has been removed.\n\nThey now say that people can still enjoy the benefits even if concentrated in one or two weekly sessions.\n\nHuw Edwards, chief executive of not-for-profit health body ukactive, said: \u201cIn previous iterations of the chief medical officers\u2019 guidelines, the focus has been on the importance of moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity, with the importance of muscle strength and activities to promote it playing second fiddle.\n\n\u201cThe latest guidelines are more reflective of the evidence and the importance of activities such as resistance training for all adults, reflecting their equal positioning alongside the aerobic activity recommendations. ukactive is proud to support these guidelines and for our research institute to feed into them.\u201d", "description": "Adults should lift weights twice a week to stay fit and healthy, according to new national guidelines.
