While they haven't confirmed their relationship, their recent actions seemed almost like a confirmation in itself, or at least a sign that some sort of reveal was coming soon.\n\nNow, though, Shamila seems to be getting shy again. Yesterday, the pair was spotted at a Halloween store in West Hollywood (side note: PLEASE say they were picking out a couples costume). When they left the store, Shawn and Camila threw on some masks, which resulted in a hilarious paparazzi moment.\n\nView photos Photo credit: BACKGRID More\n\nIt's unclear if Shawn and Camila were hiding rom the paps (I mean, it's still pretty obvious that it's them), or if they were having some fun (which also wouldn't be surprising). Either way, I'm all for it, all I'm asking is that Shawn opt for a different mask next time, because that weird baby thing is going to haunt my dreams tonight.\n\nFollow Carolyn on Instagram.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Talk about coupleghouls!", "authors": ["Carolyn Twersky"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YzY1czMs6GroNG1d.Ss9Hg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/seventeen_632/13eaccf513ccf8340f4f63f9f587c386", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
