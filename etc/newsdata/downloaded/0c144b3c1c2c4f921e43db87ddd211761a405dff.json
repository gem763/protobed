We deserved to win, we had a good reaction after they equalised, we scored but then they didn\u2019t count it.\u201d\n\nArsenal took an early 2-0 lead when Sokratis scored from a corner after Palace failed to clear the danger and, 106 seconds later, his centre back partner David Luiz made a run to the far post to tap home from another set piece.\n\nReferee Martin Atkinson then booked Wilfried Zaha for what he perceived to be a dive in the box from a Chambers challenge but VAR intervened and ruled it a penalty, which was put away by midfielder Luka Milivojevic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad for Martin because if, in the pre-VAR days, that hadn\u2019t been given, then... everyone would have said that was a clear penalty,\u201d Palace boss Roy Hodgson said. \u201cI thought it was clear and I\u2019m pleased it got overturned.\n\n\u201cOf course, we got another VAR decision that went our way at the end. There was a lot of pushing going on so I\u2019m glad the right decision was made in the end.\u201d\n\nPalace started the second half the stronger of the two sides and seven minutes after the restart, Jordan Ayew levelled the score with a header at the far post from a James McArthur cross.\n\nEmery then withdrew Granit Xhaka, with the substitution drawing ironic cheers from the home support.\n\nThe incensed skipper did not take too kindly to the reaction, cupping his hand to his ear before taking off his shirt and storming down the tunnel amid boos.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s wrong but we are going to speak inside about that situation,\u201d Emery added, refusing to discuss whether the Swiss midfielder would remain the club\u2019s captain. \u201cI want to be calm but, really, he was wrong in this action.\u201d\n\nThe game ended on a sour note when Matteo Guendouzi rugby-tackled Zaha to deny Palace a late counter-attack. The players got involved in a mini brawl and the Frenchman received a yellow card.\n\nThe result leaves Arsenal in fifth place with just two wins in their last seven games while Palace are a point behind in sixth.", "description": "Crystal Palace came back from 2-0 down against Arsenal to draw 2-2 in an eventful Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday as VAR denied the home side what would have been a late winner from Sokratis Papastathopoulos.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445591004&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0R0", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
