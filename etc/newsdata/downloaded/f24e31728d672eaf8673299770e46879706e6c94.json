A teaser trailer shows Law strolling down a beach wearing white swimwear and surrounded by women. He is mirrored by Malkovich, who walks through the Vatican in full papal garb.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised to know that those swimming trunks actually weren\u2019t the smallest costume I got to wear,\u201d Law told a news conference on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually one scene where I was wearing a napkin. I have a photo of it because it was truly the smallest costume I was ever given.\u201d\n\nIn the drama, miracles appear to take place and both popes have to learn to co-exist.\n\n\u201cThe main inducement was to work with Paolo Sorrentino,\u201d Malkovich said of joining the project.\n\n\u201cThe Vatican or even religious things in general are probably not a primary field of interest for me, but I thought he made it very interesting in the first series in a way that was quite unexpected and something with a very unique vision.\u201d", "description": "Jude Law brought the follow-up to \"The Young Pope\" to the Venice Film Festival on Sunday, presenting a glimpse of his return in the Paolo Sorrentino-directed papal drama, which at one point sees him wearing just \"a napkin\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425276025&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810C3"}
