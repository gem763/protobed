Some days it blesses him. Others, it comes for him. Same as for everyone. The best he -- anyone -- could hope for is to see it heading in his direction, the latter in particular.\n\nHe is 43 years old. That is not, in this case, how the calendar hounds him. Rather, on this Sunday, warm and sticky on the final afternoon of an eight-gamer first through San Diego and Colorado, Alex Cora awakened to September. He smiled. September can be an overbearing and wolfish beast. September fills his clubhouse and his bullpen, fills his nights, sends him home exhausted and drags him back for more September. September from 5 games back, from 15 \u00bd games back, is a god-awful mucky slog. September is his only hope. Their only hope.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nToday, it comes for him, for them all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible,\u201d Alex Cora said Sunday morning, which, sometimes, is about the best you can say for September.\n\nThe Red Sox are a fine baseball team by most standards that aren\u2019t their own, which is to say they do some things well and then they also have to pitch sometimes. David Price completed two innings Sunday, his first innings in almost a month, and the Red Sox promoted four other pitchers from Triple-A. Nate Eovaldi is back in the rotation and up to, as of his last start, 81 pitches again, and Rick Porcello\u2019s ERA is under 5 \u00bd again, and the bullpen just had its best month, and maybe they\u2019re getting somewhere and maybe they\u2019re not, and maybe it wasn\u2019t ever going to be enough without a hearty Chris Sale or genuine closer, and it is September so we\u2019ll all know soon enough.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Red Sox would board an airplane early Sunday evening for a flight back to Boston, where seven games against the Minnesota Twins and New York Yankees awaited, so it is possible the Red Sox\u2019s fate will be known not just in the broad construct of September but in the very precise hours of late Monday night, Sept. 9, when the Yankees will be clearing out from Fenway Park.\n\nBoston Red Sox manager Alex Cora knows his team will have to beat the odds to make the postseason. (Getty Images)\n\nA year ago on Sept. 1, they were 7 \u00bd games out in front of the rest of the American League East, 50 games over .500, tapering starters and resting regulars. A year ago, September was a 15-11 layup, which preceded an 11-3 October, which preceded a very cool parade. Another one.\n\nBut, first, September, 26 games to become something they\u2019ve not been, which is a whole, relentless and precise ballclub. Even then, even if the Red Sox pitch with any sort of abiding effectiveness, even if they continue to score runs, the past five months come with a cost. It might not be enough. When Cora goes for the throttle, there might not be enough under the hood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as people think it is,\u201d Cora said. \u201cWhat we did in October last year, that was out of the norm. \u2026 You look back at the World Series champs or runner-ups, what we did, it was never done before. David Price was ready to pitch every day. Rick Porcello was ready to pitch every day. Nate Eovaldi was ready to pitch every day. Now? Over 162 games, there\u2019s certain days you can do that, but the schedule will let you know when. And it\u2019s not that easy. There\u2019s stuff that we know that we don\u2019t have to tell people about it. Hey, we gotta take care of these guys. It\u2019s all in, but you gotta be careful. There\u2019s no November coming up. We got September and October. So we gotta be careful with it.\u201d\n\nSeptember, from 5 back, from 15 \u00bd back, doesn\u2019t much care for one\u2019s caution. Early on a Sunday morning, August behind him and his suitcase half-packed, Cora considered what lay ahead.\n\n\u201cI thought about the 2011 Cardinals,\u201d he said.\n\nThose Cardinals of Pujols and Holliday and Berkman and Carpenter won 23 of their last 32 games, began October as a wild card and beat the Texas Rangers in the World Series.\n\n\u201cAnd I thought about Joey in 1995,\u201d he said.\n\nBrother Joey Cora\u2019s Seattle Mariners won 25 of 36 to come from 11 \u00bd games back and win the AL West, then advanced to the ALCS.\n\n\u201c[Jhoulys] Chacin mentioned something two days ago about the Brewers last year,\u201d he said.\n\nThey were five back in the NL Central last Sept. 1, won the division and took the Dodgers to seven games in the NLCS.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll take our chances,\u201d Cora said. \u201cWe\u2019re very talented.\u201d\n\nSometimes it happens. It works. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. The rest is November. And this is where a very settled Alex Cora resides.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m human,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cThere\u2019s a few days that the kids go to sleep and I sit down on the couch and I\u2019m like, \u2018That didn\u2019t work.\u2019 But last year I did it too. So, what\u2019s the difference? The difference is last year we were 50 games over .500 and this year we\u2019re 10 games over .500.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been telling people, five years, six years ago, for some reason, my life changed. I always said my family has created so much balance in my life. I know how big this is, being the Red Sox manager. At the same time, there\u2019s bigger things in life.\u201d\n\nAlex Cora knows there's more to life than just baseball. (AP)\n\nThis time, Hurricane Dorian spared his native Puerto Rico. But it\u2019s not done.\n\n\u201cTwo days ago, three days ago, c\u2019mon, it wasn\u2019t easy to come here and think about, \u2018OK, here we are again,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut then, today, I got people in Florida too. And that thing is humongous. My mind is here but it\u2019s over there. Hopefully everybody is OK. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that. I thought Maria was huge, but this thing is kinda like perfect. You know, you see the pictures and you\u2019re kinda like, wow. You know? And hopefully nothing happens.\n\n\u201cLook at the news yesterday and saw what happened in Midland and Odessa, and here for nine innings or 15 innings? I\u2019m going to sleep well regardless of the result [of the baseball game], because I know there\u2019s bigger things than baseball. I said it last year and I said it again. It\u2019s just something I learned. Over 13 years, I told the guys, you know, for me it was a grind, playing 13 years in the big leagues. That thing of not hitting and playing in the big leagues, it was tough. How you gonna hit? And it sucked. It was a tough 13 years. I enjoyed it, but at the same time it was tough. But now? I\u2019m going to enjoy this. This is fun. When I hear Mookie [Betts] and J.D. [Martinez talking] about their struggles and their grind, I\u2019m like, \u2018Try to grind .237 for a 13-year career. That\u2019s grinding. .287 and 120 runs? C\u2019mon, bruh. You\u2019re that good. That\u2019s a bad season? Go to 2000 when I hit .200. That\u2019s tough right there.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe chuckled. At himself. At baseball. At the results of games that haven\u2019t yet been played. At the people who will play them. He did not laugh at September, though. He laughed with September. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s here. No sense making it mad.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why,\u201d he said, still smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "September fills his clubhouse and his bullpen, fills his nights, sends him home exhausted and drags him back for more September.
