U.S. gold futures GCcv1 rose 0.5% to $1,510.80 .\n\n\"Investors are now waiting for the ECB meeting, and U.S. CPI\n\ndata is expected to come negative... We may see some upside in\n\ngold,\" said Vandana Bharti, assistant vice-president of\n\ncommodity research at SMC Comtrade, adding that there was some\n\nshort covering in the market.\n\n\"So long as it is trading above $1,490, I do not consider it\n\nbearish.\"\n\nConsumer price index (CPI) from the United States for August\n\nis expected to accelerate by merely 0.1%, compared to 0.3% in\n\nJuly, according to a Reuters poll, amid expectations the Federal\n\nReserve will cut interest rates at its meeting next week.\n\nAlso expected to hint at monetary policy easing was the ECB,\n\nclosely watched for measures the bank was willing to take to\n\nsupport a dampened economy in the depth of Brexit concerns.\n\nThe ECB is set to announce its rate decision at 1145 GMT on\n\nThursday, followed by ECB President Mario Draghi's news\n\nconference at 1230 GMT.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States on Wednesday agreed to delay\n\nincreasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to\n\nOct. 15 from Oct. 1 \"as a gesture of good will\".\n\n\n\nHopes of a breakthrough in negotiations between the world's\n\ntwo biggest economies lifted risk sentiment in early trade, with\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\njumping to a six-week high.
