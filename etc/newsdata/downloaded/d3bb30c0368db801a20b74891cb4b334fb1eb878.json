There were late night phone calls and invitations to join his Australian tour, and a private screening of \u201cKung Fu Panda 3.\u201d Prince was cheerful and inquisitive, and occasionally frosty when one of Piepenbring\u2019s answers displeased him. Piepenbring was awkward and nervous.\n\nHe soon got the job.\n\nAD\n\nPrince had already settled on a title, \u201cThe Beautiful Ones,\u201d named for an iconic song from \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d He wanted to write the biggest music book in the world, one that would serve as a how-to guide for creatives, a primer on African American entrepreneurship and \u201ca handbook for the brilliant community,\u201d he told Piepenbring, \u201cwrapped in autobiography, wrapped in biography.\u201d He hoped the book would solve racism.\n\nPrince began work on the book\u2019s early chapters, eventually turning almost 30 handwritten pages over to Piepenbring. They last spoke on April 17, days after the singer collapsed on his private plane, an incident his representatives blamed on the flu. Prince called his co-writer to reassure him he was fine. \u201cI had flulike symptoms,\u201d he told Piepenbring, who would later wonder at the singer\u2019s careful choice of words. Prince would die four days later, the victim of an accidental fentanyl overdose.\n\nPrince had not written enough material to fashion a conventional memoir, and Piepenbring returned to Paisley Park the summer after the singer\u2019s death in search of supplementary material from the vaults. He pored over Prince\u2019s personal archives looking for anything that would bring him to life, for \u201cthings that communicated some intimacy,\u201d Piepenbring says. Those unearthed pieces, including Prince\u2019s handwritten song lyrics, photos captioned by the singer, personal mementos and an early treatment of the \u201cPurple Rain\u201d script, serve as the book\u2019s heavy, heartbreaking center of gravity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Beautiful Ones\u201d is a curious, fantastically moving hybrid of scrapbook and fragmented memoir, bookended by Piepenbring\u2019s recollections about working on the project before and after Prince\u2019s death. That it exists at all is remarkable. Prince\u2019s carefully tended air of mystery had served as a force field, repelling any serious attempts at biography during his lifetime. During his later years, journalists were not even allowed to record interviews or take notes and could only ask him about his present day life. \u201cI don\u2019t really do biographies,\u201d he told writer Mick Brown in 2004. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the past.\u201d\n\nA memoir, Piepenbring writes in his introduction, might have enhanced the singer\u2019s sphinx-like persona. \u201cThe right book could add new layers to his mystery, Prince thought, even as it stripped others away.\u201d Prince did not necessarily want to be understood, merely misunderstood in a new way, a desire that would seem to be fundamentally at odds with the business of memoir writing.\n\nBut the chapters written by Prince, with his familiar abbreviations faithfully replicated (\u201c2\u201d for \u201cto\u201d and \u201cY\u201d for \u201cwhy\u201d), are appealing and frank explorations of his childhood and high school romances and his parents\u2019 troubled marriage and divorce.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrince\u2019s father, whom he revered, worked at the Honeywell plant by day and played piano in Minneapolis clubs at night; \u201cPrince\u201d was his stage name. He \u201cloved the Bible & had a keen sense of morality & class,\u201d Prince writes.\n\nHis mother, unsmiling in almost every picture reproduced here, had a wild side and a stubborn streak and clashed frequently with his father. \u201cShe basically wanted 2 run the household not Him,\u201d Prince writes. \u201cBeing the only male in the house with Her, I understood Y he left.\u201d (Prince, as \u201cThe Beautiful Ones\u201d makes clear throughout, seems to have loved women more than he liked them.)\n\nHis first kiss was instigated by a fellow grade schooler who \u201clooked like Elizabeth Taylor, but little.\u201d He prized mystery from an early age, writing of one romantic encounter: \u201c(I) met her in total darkness at a house party just like my favorite scene from the movie \u2018About Time\u2019 with Rachel McAdams.\u201d Though precociously carnal, he was prematurely prim; even as a teenager, he disapproved of cursing, especially when women did it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrince\u2019s chapters end with the singer still an adolescent. The book uses photos and memorabilia (contact sheets, rare promotional photos, the lyrics to \u201cLittle Red Corvette,\u201d handwritten in red ink) to trace the singer\u2019s path to \u201cPurple Rain\u201d and effectively picks up again as he and Piepenbring meet at Paisley Park. Piepenbring and Prince only collaborated for three months, most of that time working separately. Piepenbring knew nothing of Prince\u2019s struggles with opioids, though the singer did disappear for long periods without warning and often looked tired. But his minute observations of Prince at home in his compound, in the waning days of his life, contribute almost as much to our understanding of what Prince was really like as his own writings do. Piepenbring finds Prince in the margins: He loved Stephen Colbert and disliked Ayn Rand, Piepenbring writes. The idea of Bruce Springsteen confused him. He was a careful driver. His skin was perfect. His least favorite word was \u201cmagic,\u201d because that was Michael Jackson\u2019s word.\n\n\u201cThe Beautiful Ones\u201d does not offer a clear-eyed view of who Prince really was \u2014 he would have hated that, but it illuminates more than it conceals.\n\nAllison Stewart writes about pop culture, music and politics for The Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune. She is working on a book about the history of the space program.\n\nTHE BEAUTIFUL ONES\n\nBy Prince\n\nSpiegel & Grau. 288 pp. $30\n\nAD", "description": "The book doesn\u2019t offer a clear-eyed view of who the singer really was \u2014 he would have hated that.", "authors": ["Allison Stewart"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eKiLmt5BYo6NHH7B7DOsJvJVcI4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/433TFKXZZAI6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
