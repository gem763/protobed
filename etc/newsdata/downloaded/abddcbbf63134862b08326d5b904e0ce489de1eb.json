Rumours that China may leave this week\u2019s trade talks early were recirculated in the South China Morning Post, which the US went on to deny (not sure why they\u2019d know if true though\u2026). And then reports surfaced that the US were going to suggest a currency pact with China, in which China are not to interfere with their currency (takes two to tango\u2026) and the US were going to lighten restrictions on some US companies selling to Huawei.\n\nJapan\u2019s machinery orders, a measure for business investment, fell at its fastest rate since 2009 at -14.5% YoY. This only increases the odds of to ease at their next meeting.\n\nA similar pattern has emerged with AUD and NZD taking the lead among FX majors, with JPY being the weakest currency. This has seen an far exceed their typical daily ranges, so momentum traders may want to look elsewhere for intraday trends and focus on pairs which have potential meat on the bone.\n\nAsian Cash Indices % Change\n\nEquity Brief:\n\nMix performances seen in key Asian stock markets ahead of the high-level U.S-China trade talk that is set to kick-start today in Washington. Also, contrasting trade related headlines out in Asian session today do not offer any clear direction on how the talks will progress. On the positive side, it has been reported that U.S. administration is considering a currency pact with China that could lead to a partial deal. On the negative flipside, deputy-level talks among junior trade officials have shown no progress ahead of today\u2019s key negotiation talk and the Chinese trade delegation may leave earlier today rather than stay for the scheduled two days of talks till Fri, 11 Oct.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi 200 is the worst performer today which has recorded a loss of -0.30% to hit a month low of 266 as it resumed trading from yesterday\u2019s holiday break\n\nCautious trading has continued to be seen in Hong Kong stock market as anti-government protesters have indicated to plan more protests today and over the weekend. Property related stocks have underperformed where Henderson Land, Hang Lung Properties and Sun Hung Kai Properties have dropped by -0.90% to -0.80%.\n\nUp Next\n\nA slew of data from UK includes monthly , , and . is also speaking, although it\u2019s about the new \u00a320 note so we doubt it will be riveting. Unless we see surprisingly strong rebounds on the data front, Brexit headlines remain the dominant driver behind moves.\n\nUS data is expected to remain at 2.4%, well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. A slight miss below this figure increase the already high odds that they\u2019ll (which is around 85% according to the CME FedWatch tool).\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
