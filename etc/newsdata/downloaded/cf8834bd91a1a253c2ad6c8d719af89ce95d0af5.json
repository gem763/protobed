(AP) - An autopsy has confirmed that an inmate who died at a Florida jail before his expected release had been suffering from a serious bacterial infection.\n\nThe Naples Daily News reports that the Collier County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office completed an autopsy last month stating 31-year-old Timothy Kusma died from MRSA pneumonia. MRSA is a type of bacteria that is resistant to several antibiotics and can spread through direct and indirect contact. It wasn\u2019t clear how Kusma became infected.\n\nKusma was supposed to be released April 11 after pleading no contest to a drug possession charge. The County Sheriff\u2019s Office says he suffered a medical event at the jail later that day and died after being transported to a nearby hospital.\n\nKusma had been using a wheelchair during his hearing in court.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Naples (Fla.)
