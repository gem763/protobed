Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 0.2%.\n\nAt 9:04 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 64 points, or 0.24%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 4 points, or 0.13% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 5 points, or 0.06%.\n\nAfter crossing the trillion dollar valuation mark on Wednesday, Apple Inc was set to end the week on a sour note after Goldman Sachs cut its price target on the stock.\n\nBroadcom Inc slipped 1.1% after the company said demand for microchips had bottomed out, adding that a recovery was not yet on the cards.
