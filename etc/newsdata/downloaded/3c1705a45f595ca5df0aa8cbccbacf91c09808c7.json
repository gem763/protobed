Weightman Middle School in Pasco County, was fired on Wednesday, concluding a months-long investigation that began earlier this year when his service pistol accidentally discharged just a few feet away from students, police said.\n\nInvestigators concluded that Cross had been moving the gun up and down in its holster, which caused the weapon to fire on April 30.\n\nCross, 45, admitted that he had a terrible habit of fidgeting with his weapon, Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco said Wednesday.\n\nThere were about 10 students in the cafeteria at the time. At least one student claimed to have seen Cross fidgeting with his gun in the past.\n\n\"His actions with his weapon caused it to fire,\u201d Nocco said. \"I just want to thank God that no one's kids in that lunch room were hurt. \u2026 It's sad what we have to do today. It would have been tragic if a child was harmed.\"\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nNocco said surveillance footage showed Cross leaning on a wall and lifting the pistol up and down, but it\u2019s unclear if his finger was on the trigger. The bullet hit the wall behind him and no one was hurt.\n\nHe said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement conducted an independent test of the weapon and confirmed that it did not malfunction.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it comes down to, if you leave the gun in the holster, it\u2019s not going to go off,\u201d Nocco said. \"Our members are trained on our weapons on proper handling. The actions the former member displayed are nothing that we train.\"\n\n\"We train for the opposite, that every time you use that weapon, you have to remember it is a deadly weapon,\" he added.\n\nHe said the officer was terminated for \"conduct unbecoming and use and mishandling of a weapon.\" The officer had been placed on administrative leave pending investigation.\n\nThe sheriff's office presented the case to the State Attorney's Office, which decided against criminal charges.", "description": "It concluded a months-long investigation that began when his service pistol accidentally discharged.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/ALLEN_FL_WEIGHTMAN_MIDDLE_191006KA_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
