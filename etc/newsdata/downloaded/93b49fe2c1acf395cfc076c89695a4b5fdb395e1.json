Jessica Shapiro\n\nInvestors take a dim view of insider sales, and so most biting that bullet tend to do so in one big hit.\n\nNot so Accent Group co-founder Michael Hapgood, who's filed no fewer than five seperate notices over the past month advising the market of his sales.\n\nHe first offloaded 1.2 million shares between September 5 and 9. And another 672,693 over the next four days. He sold 83,283 shares on October 16, 322,310 between September 26 to October 1, and another 530,455 between October 2 and 4.\n\nAll up, that's 2.3 million shares divested, for a total monetary gain of $4.4 million. No reason was given to the bourse for the sales, though Hapgood does still own 11.7million shares. Not that we'd put our money on him being done. He last sold shares in May, in a similar stop-start pattern ...\n\nAccent Group, of Athlete's Foot fame, is trading near the all-time highs it achieved in 2016, having announced a record profit in August. It's largest shareholder is retail entrepreneur and board director Brett Blundy, who's been holding on to his 18 per cent stake.", "description": "Investors take a dim view of insider sales, and so most biting that bullet tend to do so in one big hit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4a54facc71f92b76e091134be561a3349c568687", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
