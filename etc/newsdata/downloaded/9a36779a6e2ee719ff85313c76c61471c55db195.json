That\u2019s a big guy \u2013 385lbs of brawn coming at me!\u2019\n\nOn whether he\u2019d consider taking on Velasquez, he continued: \u2018Who knows?

Maybe Cain Velasquez, maybe Brock Lesnar, who knows.\u2019\n\nAsked if the Strowman fight could impact the Wilder rematch, he continued: \u2018There\u2019s a hell of a chance of that.\n\nLesnar and former UFC heavyweight champion Velasquez will face off in Saudi Arabia (Getty)\n\n\u2018Getting invited here, people say \u201cWWE is fake, it\u2019s this it\u2019s that\u201d, when I got here it was a hard reality. It\u2019s the most physical, taxing sport I\u2019ve ever been involved in.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve only had a few days training, this is a really, really physical, damaging, brutalising sport. It\u2019s really opened my eyes to how athletic these guys really are.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a contact sport, there\u2019s going to be injuries. I\u2019m not worried. I\u2019m a prize fighter, a fighting man. I\u2019m the Gypsy King. I\u2019ve been fighting my whole life, this is just another step along the road of fighting.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Tyson Fury\u2019s wrestling career may not stop with his bout again Braun Strowman, with the heavyweight lineal champion teasing the possibility of taking on Brock Lesnar or Cain Velasquez.
