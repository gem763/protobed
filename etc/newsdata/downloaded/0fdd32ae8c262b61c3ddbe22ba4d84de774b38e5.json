The accounts will also come with a Mastercard debit card MA, -0.75% . The rollout comes nearly a year after Robinhood first announced it would offer cash management accounts, named Robinhood Checking & Savings, offering 3% interest.\n\nRead more: Robinhood\u2019s new checking accounts may not be insured after all\n\nBut within days of announcing those accounts, the head of Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC), a bipartisan group of senators and analysts raised concerns about the product. Stephen Harbeck, then president and CEO of the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC), said it would only provide insurance protection for cash that\u2019s used to buy securities.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and SIPC. They said Robinhood\u2019s marketing could \u201cmislead\u201d consumers. By January, Robinhood quietly removed the wait list for cash management accounts and said it would revamp the program.\n\nHow Robinhood\u2019s accounts will work\n\nFunds deposited into Robinhood\u2019s accounts are automatically \u201cswept\u201d into accounts at partner banks. The company said it could change those partner banks at any time. Customers will be insured for up to $250,000 at each of these partner banks, for a maximum of $1.25 million, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nRobinhood said there are currently six banks participating in the program: Goldman Sachs GS, -1.25%, HSBC HSBC, -1.35%, Wells Fargo WFC, -2.07%, Citibank C, -1.86%, Bank of Baroda BANKBARODA, -1.52% and U.S. Bank USB, -2.52%. (The accounts also come with debit cards issued by Sutton Bank, but Sutton Bank will not hold any deposits.)\n\nAlso see: 3 things NOT to do with your savings now that the Fed has cut interest rates\n\nHowever, customers will need to monitor their individual accounts at each of the partner banks to ensure that the funds deposited don\u2019t exceed $250,000. And if customers already have accounts at one of these banks, they can request that Robinhood sweep their cash management deposits to another institution if they\u2019re in danger of surpassing the $250,000 limit at a given bank.\n\nRobinhood said it charges no maintenance fees on the cash management accounts nor any foreign transactions fees on the debit card. There is also no dollar minimum required to open a cash-management account. The debit card prevents overdrafts by declining any transactions that would put the account in the red.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Nearly 70% of Americans are making this huge mistake with their money\n\nThe debit card can be used to withdraw cash for free from ATMs in the Allpoint or MoneyPass networks. If the card is used at an out-of-network ATM, Robinhood won\u2019t reimburse customers for any out-of-network ATM fees they incur.\n\nHow Robinhood\u2019s accounts stack up\n\nOther companies have already released their own versions of these banking products, including online lender SoFi, wireless company T-Mobile TMUS, -1.02%, and robo advisory firms Acorns, Stash, Wealthfront and Betterment. Unlike Robinhood, Betterment will reimburse customers for out-of-network ATM fees.\n\nWhile Robinhood\u2019s 2.05% APY is well below the 3% it initially promised, it\u2019s broadly in line with other institutional APYs such as Wealthfront (2.07%), Betterment (2.04%) and SoFi (1.80%). These are lower than many bank APYs, however. Vio Bank offers 2.42% APY. According to personal-finance site Bankrate, that\u2019s the best rate available as of October 2019.", "description": "The accounts come with an APY of 2.05%, well below the 3% the company originally promised back in December.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GF592_robinh_ZG_20180315173304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
