General Assembly", "language": "en", "text": "Everything you need to know about the U.N. General Assembly Presented by S&P Global\n\nWELCOME TO POLITICO'S FIRST-EVER UNITED NATIONS PLAYBOOK.\n\nWhy are we doing this? The United Nations General Assembly, from the depths of the Cold War to today, is simply the world\u2019s biggest diplomatic platform. Each year, representatives of nearly 200 countries gather in New York to press their agendas, network and gossip.\n\nI\u2019ll be at U.N. headquarters in Turtle Bay and leapfrogging through a maze of side events to guide you through a jam-packed week, along with my colleagues from the POLITICO mothership in Washington and our European office in Brussels. Send tips, spotteds and gripes to rheath@politico.com.\n\nThe 2019 meeting comes at a time of North Korean missile launches, U.S.-Iran tensions, Kashmir flare-ups, Hong Kong protests and a breakdown in Afghan peace talks. Nearly everyone is talking climate action \u2014 with the notable exception of the U.S. \u2014 but their words aren\u2019t meeting their Paris climate agreement commitments, prompting a global \u201cclimate strike\u201d in 4,500 cities and towns taking place today.\n\nThe U.K. is Brexiting, Russia is disrupting, and China\u2019s strategic rise marches on. It\u2019s a more competitive form of multilateralism than the old days of America vs. the Soviets, that\u2019s for sure \u2014 and it\u2019s only getting more complicated.\n\nA message from S&P Global: Providing essential data requires that we go beyond the balance sheet.

Click here for more details.\n\nA Little Context\n\nTo its critics, the U.N. General Assembly is a pointless gabfest and an excuse for the wives of dictators to enjoy some 5th Avenue shopping. A more accurate picture is that UNGA is the most important event where not much gets decided. It\u2019s the political equivalent of \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t let the boring speeches by leaders and woke rhetoric fool you. Yes, UNGA lacks the deals of Davos, the military brass of security summits and the silicon glitz of hedge fund and tech retreats. But it\u2019s geopolitics and policy by all means possible, in the greatest city on Earth.\n\nIT\u2019S THE CIVIL SOCIETY, STUPID: The business getting done here is that of long-term thinking and networking, most of it away from the headlines.\n\nThat is born of necessity. Official U.N. channels are almost destined to gum up. The Security Council operates by veto; the General Assembly accords Tuvalu and the United States equal voting power; and the U.N. bureaucracy can\u2019t raise any of its own funds, leaving it reliant on a few generous donor governments and a notoriously messed-up staffing system.\n\nIn recent years, the world\u2019s activist and donor classes have taken it upon themselves to rewire the organization. They\u2019ve been joined by local and regional governments in changing the U.N. from the outside. What\u2019s really happening is that these external pressures on the U.N. are the vanguard of a revolution in diplomacy.\n\nDiplomacy is no longer only a government-to-government affair. Leaders and ambassadors matter \u2014 they\u2019re the reason everyone is gathered in New York \u2014 but the main actors in this brave new world think only a fool would leave it to them to address a challenge like climate change.\n\nHACKING THE U.N.: Over 20 years and two rounds of U.N.-mandated global development goals, NGOs (including plenty of large corporations and banks) have begun delivering a dizzying array of partnerships \u2014 with, adjacent to, and sometimes in spite of \u2014 official U.N. systems. They aim to do everything from save a million children from cancer to getting everyone a toilet. They want to restore the climate to its pre-industrial balance and stop pandemics. This year will also be the most youthful UNGA ever \u2014 thanks to two \u201cclimate strikes\u201d led by teenagers that will bookend the week. If it looks messy and chaotic, that\u2019s because it is.\n\nNAVIGATING THE MAZE: UNGA week is so decentralized it\u2019s hard to know where to start. That\u2019s because UNGA is where the world, not just the 1 percent, comes to lobby, network and protest.\n\nWhile first-timers at the U.N. likely see only a maze of rapporteurs and envoys and acronyms, and reporters may be tempted to focus on only what the national leaders do and say on the treadmill of five-minute speeches in front of other leaders, the real action is elsewhere.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help: More than 300 events are taking place over the coming week, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s got you covered. Read on for traffic and coffee tips, event listing and insights from behind the curtains at ambassadors\u2019 residences across the Big Apple.\n\nOfficial Narratives vs. Corridor Talk\n\nJeffrey Feltman, a former chief foreign policy adviser to current U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and his predecessor Ban Ki-moon, now at the Brookings Institution, says, \u201cI\u2019m always struck by the official discrepancy between the high-level agenda and what everyone talks about in the corridors.\u201d This year he expects climate will be prominent both on and off official podiums, but other corridor talk \u201cwill be about Iran, energy supplies and trade wars. The U.S. is in the middle of all three of those.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d between Trump and Barack Obama and how they use the week, Feltman noted. Obama would pick an issue each year to \u201cforce an agenda on the entire international community,\u201d he said, but there\u2019s no clear sense of what the Trump administration will push this year. It will be prominent, but not by design.\n\nStorylines to Watch for This Week\n\nU.S. v. World: That\u2019s a given as a climate narrative, and many countries will push it as a trade narrative as well. With the Trump administration looking to overhaul its development and U.N. funding approach, the world\u2019s list of grievances will be longer than usual.\n\nWill Trump and Rouhani meet? Almost certainly not. The U.S. is open to meeting with the Iranian leader, but will not make concessions to secure such talks, and the recent attacks in Saudi Arabia all but foreclosed the possibility.\n\nFrance as global mediator: Emmanuel Macron will spend the week pushing allies to adopt a new type of multilateralism with France as the new global mediator. Case in point: While President Trump won\u2019t meet with the Iranians, Macron will likely meet with both and ferry ideas back and forth. The goal: deescalation, while accepting that France can\u2019t force those who don\u2019t want to negotiate to negotiate. Macron is seizing the opportunity of Boris Johnson being distracted with Brexit, Angela Merkel being in her twilight and Justin Trudeau flailing in scandal. His top issues will be climate, Iran and Libya.\n\nBrexit: The U.K. and Europe are in the middle of a full-blown meltdown in relations, with British PM Boris Johnson trying to make good on his promise to leave the EU. We\u2019ll give you a daily Boris Brief, with tips on what to care and not care about in the Brexit circus.\n\nIs democracy failing? With strongmen leaders set to dominate the first day of leaders\u2019 speeches on Tuesday, it\u2019s worth pondering whether democracy\u2019s golden age is over. As one recent POLITICO Magazine piece put it: \u201cIn 1945, according to one survey, there were just 12 democracies in the entire world. By the end of the century there were 87. But then came the great reversal.\u201d\n\nLeader Watch\n\nWHO\u2019S IN AND WHO\u2019S OUT: The list of no-shows is substantial this year. Don\u2019t expect to see Russian President Vladimir Putin, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping, Canada\u2019s Trudeau (election), Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu, Iran\u2019s Hassan Rouhani or North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un. (PassBlue has been keeping tabs.)\n\nOne country going big is Ireland. Despite the shadow of Brexit hanging over the Emerald Isle, they\u2019re sending their prime minister, president and foreign minister to lobby for a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. That\u2019s an attempt to counterbalance any negative effects of Brexit, and to catch Canada napping as the country sends only a thin delegation while the rest of the heavy-hitters are campaigning to save their jobs in the federal election. Note to Justin Trudeau: Brownface is an especially bad look at the United Nations.\n\nWHERE\u2019S TRUMP? Today he\u2019s meeting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison before a state dinner in honor of the Australians tonight at the White House. Trump heads to Houston on Sunday for a rally with Indian PM Narendra Modi. When Trump hits New York next week (he speaks to the General Assembly Tuesday morning), his meetings are expected to include Boris Johnson and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president. One of Trump\u2019s side engagements will be a campaign fundraising dinner charging a whopping $250,000 per couple, CBS reported.\n\nCRAFT LIKE NO ONE\u2019S WATCHING: After months with no U.S. ambassador in Turtle Bay, Kelly Craft is now finally in place, with a difficult journey ahead of her. Beyond mounting global frustration with her boss, Craft also has to deal with people dismissing her position. The job no longer has Cabinet rank, and with Craft being the fourth woman in a row to hold the post, the corridor chatter among some diplomatic dinosaurs is that the women can keep the job.\n\nWhat\u2019s Craft\u2019s strategy? Lay low and drink tea. Craft is out greasing the wheels of U.S. diplomacy in a series of what could end up being more than 100 meet-and-greet sessions with fellow ambassadors to the U.N. Don\u2019t underestimate that approach: The previous U.S. ambassador, Nikki Haley, was well-briefed but reputed to rub her colleagues the wrong way. Craft\u2019s plan is to avoid that by sticking to the people skills she knows best, according to her team.\n\nWHO RUNS THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ANYWAY? Poverty, education and inclusion top the priority list of Nigeria\u2019s U.N. envoy, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, who is in charge of the General Assembly this year. Check out the U.N. News interview.\n\n\u2014 Fun fact: China offered to fund Muhammad-Bande\u2019s office for the next year, according to Nigeria's minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama.\n\nCLIMATE IS THE INESCAPABLE ISSUE: Whether leaders care to address it or not, everyone else, from the U.N. bureaucracy to the world\u2019s biggest banks to angry students, are forcing the issue. Jeff Bezos is the latest to join the mix. You know climate action is mainstream when Mike Bloomberg and some of the world\u2019s largest institutions across the investment chain \u2014 Allianz Global Investors, AXA, Enel, Goldman Sachs, Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment Fund, HSBC, and Macquarie \u2014 have urged peers to accelerate low-carbon investments via a Climate Finance Leadership Initiative.\n\nPre-Game Listening\n\nInside Russia\u2019s U.N. mission: The U.N.-Scripted podcast, by Stephanie Fillion and Kacie Candela, spoke to Russia\u2019s first deputy permanent representative (No. 2) Dmitry Polyanskiy.\n\nGerman perspective: Berlin\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Christoph Heusgen, has a video Q&A on YouTube, discussing Germany\u2019s role in the Security Council and its priorities for the UNGA.\n\nU.N. insiders: Before POLITICO\u2019s own U.N. podcast runs next week, I recommend Mark Leon Goldberg\u2019s Global Dispatches as a way to get up to speed. Two recent episodes include an interview with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, and another with Margaret Besheer, U.N. correspondent for Voice of America, and Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group.\n\nCatching Our Eye\n\nConflict in perspective: UNICEF laid out 3,758 school backpacks on a New York park lawn, representing the number of child deaths in conflict over the past year.\n\nUNGA fashion: Ralph Lauren has a sale on its U.N.-inspired tote bag \u2014 yours for just $39.99.\n\nDataPoints of the Day\n\nPANDEMIC + MISINFORMATION + AIR TRAVEL = 50 MILLION DEAD: In an optimistic start to the General Assembly, the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board has warned that no one\u2019s ready for the next major pandemic (think 1919\u2019s Spanish flu), which could easily spread globally in 36 hours and kill more than 50 million people. Deutsche Welle has more.\n\nTAKE A PEW: The Pew Research Center\u2019s latest report on global threats (based on 2018 data) shows that climate change is still is still seen as the top concern, but cyberattacks are becoming a growing fear.\n\nWHATEVER YOU DO, PREPARE TO WALK: If you don\u2019t have a motorcade this week, just walk or use the subway. Do not even attempt to using group rides (like UberPool or Lyft Shared Ride), and if you do insist on using a ride-sharing app, be willing to redirect your driver away from street closures. And when you do walk, carry and ID and any U.N. or side summit credentials you\u2019ve been issued. It\u2019s a fortress around the main U.N. venues and nearby hotels.\n\nDON\u2019T FORGET: The experts at the U.N. Foundation recommend that Playbook readers carry with them phone chargers, hand sanitizer, foot blister strips and granola bars at all times. Don\u2019t expect food and transport to be a regular part of your day, in other words.\n\nU.N. TRIVIA: Seth Rogen and his longtime film-making buddy Evan Goldberg are developing a United Nations comedy for CBS, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMEET ME AT THE DELEGATES\u2019 LOUNGE: This formerly dark and smoky bar is where U.S. and Soviet ambassadors used to back-channel. Post Cold War, the lounge was redecorated under orders from the famous multilateralist queen of the Netherlands, Beatrix. The lounge is really a bar at night (in particular Fridays) with spectacular East River views, known affectionately as the U.N.\u2019s \u201cSeventh Committee\u201d room.\n\nPOPEYES CHICKEN FOR THE WIN: Brazil\u2019s President wants a new 35-year-old ambassador to handles his diplomacy in the U.S. He has relatively little international experience, but one important qualification: He is President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s son. Eduardo did spend a year in the U.S., however \u2026 working at Popeyes fried chicken chain in Maine. Watch him here.\n\nELEVATOR PITCHES: Always know what you want from the U.S. and other Security Council members: You might see their diplomats and cabinet members for two minutes only or in an elevator. You better be ready to ask on the spot.\n\nHOT TICKET: DJ Jacques Lavoisier is spinning at the Party for Good (\u201cFrom Cannes to UNGA\u201d) on Sunday, Sept. 22, from 5-7 p.m.. Where? The Century Association, 7 W 43rd Street, New York, NY. The brains behind the party is Claudia Romo Edelman\u2019s We Are All Human project.\n\nCoffee Tips\n\nPennylane Coffee \u2014 3-minute walk from HQ, 305 E 45th St.\n\nGround Central, also great for an extra-spicy ginger beer \u2014 5-minute walk from HQ, 800 2nd Ave.\n\nCafe Grumpy, at the edge of the Grand Central complex \u2014 9-minute walk from HQ, 89 E 42nd St.\n\nBlue Bottle \u2014 12-minute walk from HQ, 60 E 42nd St #140.\n\nU.N. Glossary\n\nLOST IN TRANSLATION: Welcome to the wild ride of U.N. bureaucratic self-sabotage. Here at Turtle Bay, individual U.N. agencies often have their own thesaurus and glossary services. There\u2019s a directory of dictionaries and a general glossary.\n\nOur favorites include:\n\nGs 4 through 90: These acronyms refer to various groups of U.N. member countries. As in this helpful explanation of the G6: \u201cThe G5 plus Panama.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also CONGO (Committee on Non-Government Organizations) and GUAM (a political, economic and strategic alliance uniting Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova). Sorry to actual Congo and Guam.\n\nYou can also join the Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole of the Regular Process, UNCOPUOS (United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) and ACABQGA, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (General Assembly).\n\nIf that\u2019s too simple for you, please enjoy ICPRCP. That\u2019s the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation.\n\nA message from S&P Global: \u201cEuropean utilities have noted a strong rise in demand for green electricity \u2013 that is, electricity from renewable sources. An important part of the response has been the use of Guarantees of Origin (GOs) \u2013 tradable tags that certify the provenance of power supply, down to quite specific details of the generation technology involved and the geographic location.
