This is an argument best articulated by David Goldblatt in his new book, \u2018The Age of Football\u2019, which posits that there has never been a cultural pursuit in the entire history of humanity like football. Nothing \u2013 not the music of Elvis or the Beatles, not classic western movies \u2013 has crossed as many international borders so successfully. One of the problems from that is there is a clear top end, which intensifies interest in it and thereby investment in it, creating a perpetually reinforcing cycle.\n\nThis has combined with sports science and technology to put such countries even further ahead. One of the reasons that there were more upsets in the past, that football felt more of a level playing field, was because it was more difficult for the big teams to maximise their resources. The relatively basic nature of the game \u2013 in terms of tactics, in terms of preparation \u2013 ensured there were just more rough edges, no matter how good the teams.\n\nNow, sports science and tactics have reached the kind of level where those rough edges have been almost entirely smoothed. It\u2019s not so much about marginal gains but the margin for error being reduced.\n\nWith England, you only have to walk around St George\u2019s Park to realise that. The same is true of the set-ups in Germany, Spain and France.\n\nMany smaller countries just can\u2019t compete with this, but it has reached crisis point in many eastern European countries \u2013 and previous giants \u2013 due to problems specific to the areas.\n\nMany are related to the final crumbling of the old Soviet structures and the failure to properly replace them, with the effects of that on the game exacerbated by demographic changes and basic corruption \u2013 especially in Bulgaria.\n\nThis is why manager Krasimir Balakov, one of the country\u2019s genuine greats, has been forced to give a debut to a 31-year-old Brazilian who has never amounted to much beyond a few years in the Bulgarian national league. This is what it has come to.\n\nThis is specifically why England are enjoying so many games in this group that amount to first-rate hammerings when they barely have to get out of second gear.\n\nIt does of course feel something of a shame to just overlook the improvements that Southgate has clearly made with this side, but you can\u2019t overlook the context. It sometimes feels like the games are so easy, and the group such a fait accompli, that barely any of the results or decisions really matter at this point.\n\nThis is how we get to a situation where Southgate came out with the following. \u201cI think that Tuesday\u2019s game will be completely different by the way. I think that they are a really good side, so we have not had the tight, tense matches that the Nations League provided as of yet, that really we learnt so much more from. So, therefore, we\u2019ve got to do that in training and the challenge of training has got to be so high that we learn from those moments and we can see what the players are capable of. So, have we progressed? Well I think we have.\u201d\n\nSouthgate of course didn\u2019t mean it like this, but he\u2019s pretty much saying some of England\u2019s training sessions are more testing than their matches. That\u2019s how far they, and a group of about six to seven other teams, are ahead. This is the problem with international football, and the sport as a whole.\n\nA further problem with the current European Championship structure is that at least one of these teams \u2013 who barely constituted any contest at all for England \u2013 are going to be in the tournament. As with Euro 2016, it is going to lead to a lot of low-quality matches at the competition itself.\n\nAnd yet this really shouldn\u2019t be a complaint, because it represents a potential solution and productive response.\n\nOne of the arguments put forward for expanding the Euros in the first place was because of the excitement that goes around countries that rarely qualify. It creates a buzz and a groundswell for investment.\n\nIt is giving something back in a football world where all the money is only going in certain directions.\n\nEngland, however, are only going one way in this group: straight to the top, uncontested. And it is as much to do with the problems in the game as it is with their undeniable progress.", "description": "It was an entirely fair response in the aftermath of a match that was almost unfair in terms of the vast difference in quality.
