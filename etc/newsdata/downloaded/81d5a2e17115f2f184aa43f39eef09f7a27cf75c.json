Bush\u2019s friendship drew the ire of Democratic presidential candidates and viewers alike following Tuesday night\u2019s debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.\n\nAfter the three-hour televised event, viewers and some Democratic hopefuls slammed debate moderator Anderson Cooper\u2019s final question of the evening, which did not focus on what many thought could have been more important issues, like climate change.\n\n\u201cLast week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, \u2018We\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK, that we\u2019re all different,\u2019\u201d Cooper said to the 12 candidates onstage.\n\nELTON JOHN DEFENDS ELLEN DEGENERES, GEORGE W. BUSH'S FRIENDSHIP AFTER TWITTER BACKLASH\n\n\u201cSo in that spirit, we\u2019d like you to tell us about a friendship that you\u2019ve had that would surprise us and what impacts it\u2019s had on you and your beliefs.\u201d\n\nMany quickly took to social media to call out and even outright mock the debate question.\n\n\u201cWhen you're eight hours into the debate and Anderson Cooper asks a question about Ellen,\u201d tweeted Trevor Noah\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d\n\nCNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'\n\n\u201cHey, let\u2019s do 20 closing minutes on that Ellen/Bush meme thing. Immigration and climate change can wait until the next debate if the world is still here,\u201d another user tweeted.\n\nPresidential candidates Julian Castro and Sen. Kamala Harris also called out the question, suggesting there were more poignant topics to address on the Democratic presidential primary\u2019s biggest night so far.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThree hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border,\u201d Castro tweeted. \u201cBut you know, Ellen. #DemocraticDebate.\u201d\n\nHarris had a similar response, tweeting, \u201cThree hours. Not one question about the climate crisis. Not one question about LGBTQ+ rights. Not one question about immigration. These issues are too important to ignore. #DemDebate.\u201d", "description": "A question about Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W.
