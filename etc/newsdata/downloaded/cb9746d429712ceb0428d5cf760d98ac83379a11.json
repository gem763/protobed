WE, +0.00% , the parent of the office-space company WeWork, postponed its IPO and forced its chief executive to step down amid mounting concern about its huge losses and high leverage.\n\n\u201cThe IPO window is closing on growth-at-all-costs, highly valued private companies that are trying to come to market with excessively valued pricing,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO exchange-traded funds.\n\nEndeavor EDR, +0.00% , an entertainment powerhouse that also owns sports and modeling agency IMG and mixed-martial-arts organization UFC, among other properties, said it now plans to offer just 15 million shares priced at $26 to $27 each, down from 19.4 million shares priced at $30 to $32 each in a filing on Sept. 16.\n\nThe company would raise $480 million at the top of that range, with proceeds earmarked for the repayment of debt and for working capital and general corporate purposes.

CrowdStrike CRWD, -6.00% , which went public in June, has a one-month negative return of 30%, she said.\n\n\u201cEven the IPO ETF has had a pullback related to this,\u201d she said. \u201cAny company looking to go public and their underwriters should be looking at that.\u201d\n\nSee now: Peloton\u2019s bikes are expensive.
