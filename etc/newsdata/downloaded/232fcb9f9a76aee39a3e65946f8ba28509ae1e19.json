Nonetheless, there remains a significant amount of unease as to what might unfold over the course of the next few days and weeks.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this uncertainty equity markets have struggled to push on significantly from the gains, we\u2019ve seen over the course of the previous three weeks, with US markets struggling to push on beyond their previous record highs from July.\n\n\n\nBond markets have been a little more skittish with tensions in the repo market likely to remain on a day when triple witching takes place. The Fed will likely inject further liquidity into a market that appears to be suffering from a shortage of US dollars, and will probably continue to do so until the end of the quarter, as banks and hedge funds tidy up their balance sheets and boost their cash levels before the end of the quarter.\n\n\n\nThis week\u2019s central bank meetings have gone some way to tempering some of this week\u2019s unease, with the Federal Reserve once again cutting rates, and the People\u2019s Bank of China modestly trimmed its one year loan rate this morning, while the Swiss National Bank, Bank of Japan and the Bank of England left policy unchanged. Nonetheless, the lack of more aggressive action by all of these major players does appear to give the impression that all are operating at the limits of their ability to ease further, and in so doing mitigate any further economic weakness.\n\n\n\nYesterday the OECD acknowledged the challenges facing the global economy by downgrading its forecasts for the global economy by sharply downgrading its forecasts for 2019, from 3.2% to 2.9% the lowest level since 2009, citing the US, China trade war, a slowing global economy, as well as Brexit concerns.\n\n\n\nThese challenges were no better illustrated yesterday when the European Central Bank launched its first tranche of three-year loans at zero rates and below, and which fell well short of expectations. Instead of the \u20ac20bn to \u20ac100bn of loans that were expected the princely sum of \u20ac3.4bn found its way out of the door.\n\n\n\nThere may have been any number of reasons for the lack of demand, but if no-one wants to invest or borrow money, no amount of cheap cash will compel them to do so. This is the problem Europe faces at the moment. Quite simply firms will not commit to large scale investment decisions when there is no certainty about business conditions at a time when the US may want to turn its attention to Europe where tariffs are concerned, China is slowing down, and Brexit is unresolved.\n\n\n\nThe pound did get a lift last night when European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said that he would be prepared to get rid of the Irish backstop if the UK can present viable alternatives that protect the integrity of the single market. This presents a significant shift of position by the commission which until recently had refused point-blank any prospect that the withdrawal agreement could be changed.\n\n\n\n\u2013 still in the downtrend but stuck in a range currently with support at the 1.0925 area. We currently have resistance back near the 50-day MA now at 1.1120. While below here the risk remains for a retest of the lows.\n\n\n\n\u2013 has continued to edge higher, hitting two-month highs at 1.2560 yesterday, as it looks to head towards the 200-day MA at 1.2740. We have support at the lows this week at 1.2380, while below that larger support at the 1.2280 area.\n\n\n\n\u2013 appears to have cracked below the 200-day MA at 0.8840, as it looks to close in on the 0.8795 level initially, which would be a 61.8% retrace of the entire 0.8475/ 0.9325 up move. A break below 0.8790 opens up 0.8720. We currently have resistance at the 0.8900 area, which should contain any pullbacks.\n\n\n\n\u2013 this week\u2019s failure at 108.50 has seen the US dollar slide back, opening up the prospect of a move back to the 107.20 level, and 106.00, after yesterday\u2019s bearish daily reversal. Only a move back above this week\u2019s high has the potential to negate.\n\n\n\nis expected to open 30 points lower at 7,326\n\n\n\nis expected to open 22 points lower at 12,435\n\n\n\nis expected to open 13 points lower at 5,646\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
