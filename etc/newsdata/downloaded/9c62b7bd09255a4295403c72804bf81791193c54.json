The Great British Baking Show \u2014 or The Great British Bake Off if you\u2019re nasty/watching outside the U.S. \u2014 is back, and for the first time ever, it will air week to week on Netflix, mere days after each episode\u2019s U.K. premiere. Are you ready? Let\u2019s do this!\n\nIf you recall, last season went completely off the rails when the producers decided to start with Biscuits Week instead of Cake Week, which sent them down a slippery slope toward forcing the final three bakers to make pita over a live fire. Those were dark times. But they appear to have come to their senses because this season \u2014 the show\u2019s tenth \u2014 is starting off with layers and layers of sponge, plus one extra baker. A baker\u2019s dozen. Get it?\n\nPaul and Prue immediately point out that the presence of an extra baker means at some point, perhaps in episode one or episode seven, two bakers will go home. That means there\u2019ll be no barely squeaking by this season, and the bakers are appropriately shooketh. So shooketh, in fact, that Michael, a bespectacled Scottish contestant, immediately cuts his finger in the first five TV minutes of the competition, officially kicking off what we like to call Tape Watch\u2122.\n\nThis injury takes place at the start of the first signature challenge: Fruit cakes! About half the bakers say they\u2019re using a recipe created by their mother, grandmother, or great-grandmother, which tells you a lot about the state of fruit cake right now, and all of them are using the same vaguely brown, orange, and yellow fruits: raisins, golden raisins, currants, etc. But not to worry, a few bakers came to make things interesting.\n\nRosie, a fast-talking veterinarian, is using dried fruit in her Spicy Chai Loaf to avoid any fruit sinkage. Alice, a geography teacher at an all-boys school, is making a Gingerbread Loaf that you can hang on your door for hungry but unwanted visitors. Dan, a man-bunned giant of a bloke who works with people with learning disabilities, is going for tropical flavors with a Jamaican Rum Cake, as is Priya, an aspiring novelist and mother of two, whose Sunshine Fruit Cake features dried papaya and pineapple.\n\nA few counters over, David, a fitness-obsessed international health advisor, can\u2019t wait for Paul and Prue to taste his completely fatless Squishy Squashy Fruit Cake. \u201cI love healthy baking,\u201d he exclaims. The cameras quickly cuts away before he gets into the life-changing benefits of intermittent fasting, and they land squarely on Helena, a What We Do In The Shadows cosplayer, who describes herself as Halloween-obsessed. Accordingly, her Fruit Bat Cake will feature a flying mouse with caramel wings. Oooh!\n\nMeanwhile, Michael cuts himself again just 11 TV minutes in. And for possibly the first time in show history, we see the gloved hands of a GBBO medic. What must his or her life be like, standing by just waiting for amateur bakers to mutilate themselves in pursuit of a cake plate and literally no other reward? Please reach out so we can discuss.\n\nJudging begins and \u2014 as always seems to be the case \u2014 Paul and Prue like the majority of what\u2019s presented. Prue is head over heels for 20-year-old Jamie\u2019s marzipan-heavy, Easter-Themed Cake. And even though English Lit. student Henry\u2019s royal icing house fell apart, the judges enjoy his Wood Street Cake, which is apparently based on a 400-year-old recipe. Amelia\u2019s naked fruit cake \u201cscreams Christmas,\u201d according to Paul. Priya, Steph, and Michael (now with three of the five fingers on his left hand wrapped) do pretty well, too.\n\nAt the bottom: Helena, who straight up forgot how to make caramel; Rosie, whose cake just looks bad and tastes worse; and Michelle, who is betrayed by her family\u2019s beloved, tough fruit cake. But it\u2019s Dan the Man-Bun Man who receives the harshest Cake-Week critique of all time: The inside of his cake is \u201craaaauw.\u201d A collective shudder moves through the room. He could have killed Paul and Prue.\n\nDan is ashamed, but he hasn\u2019t given up, though he\u2019s been humbled. Plus, everyone knows it\u2019s the Technical Challenge that separates the men/women/them from the boys/girls/them. It is the part of the competition that strips you of your ego, and Prue, who sets this week\u2019s challenge, admits that she\u2019s feeling \u201ca little mean.\u201d Paul\u2019s eyes light up in a way that\u2019s not entirely unsexual. She\u2019s asked the bakers to create a tri-colored angel cake with genoise sponge (one of the hardest sponges to make) with buttercream and feathered icing.\n\nAmelia, a 20-something from Halifax with pink ends and a can-do attitude, points out that you don\u2019t want to overmix a genoise sponge. Paul, a middle-aged father of two, agrees because doing so will give you a piece of rubber rather than a light, airy sponge. From the get-go, Jamie, who\u2019s spending his gap year on network television, is a complete disaster. He forgets to put the eggs in the sponge and decides to start over. The second time around, he messes up again. But because Jamie was raised on memes and Spongebob, he approaches the whole thing with a very laissez-faire attitude, laughing to keep from crying, which he refuses to do on camera.\n\nPaul and Prue begin dissecting the cakes. Some have great flavor, some look pretty good, and a few have achieved the desired height. When judging Helena\u2019s cake, Paul jokes that he could drop it and it would bounce right back, which is the same joke Helena made five TV minutes back. Television magic? In the end, it\u2019s Jamie, Helena, and accident-prone Michael who fill out the bottom three, while veterinarian Rosie, college student Henry, and Steph of Britain\u2019s Biggest Bangs claim the top spots. Everyone begins to mentally note that they shouldn\u2019t sleep on Henry.\n\nFor the Showstopper Challenge, the judges ask the bakers to dig into the good parts of their childhoods and create the birthday cake they dreamed of as a kid. There are two fairy cakes, two pirate cakes, two book cakes, and a carousel cake. However, the real fun begins when the weirdo kids who became weirdo adults come out of the woodwork, like Healthy David, who reveals that he had a pet snake and plans on making a cake featuring a snake coiled around an egg of baby gummy snakes. Phil creates a cake modeled after the U.S. moon landing of 1969. Only Steph really digs into the trauma of childhood, with a cake meant to look like a fallen ice-cream cone.\n\nJamie and Dan both know this is their last chance to prove that they\u2019re worthy of being in the tent. Dan is making a Pirate Island Cake with a passionfruit curd, while Jamie is dedicating his cake to his family\u2019s schnauzers, with salted-caramel buttercream, salted-caramel sauce, and salted-caramel sponge plus little vanilla biscuits (for humans) that look like treats (for dogs). In the background of all this, Michael \u2014 who is \u2026 a lot \u2014 drops one of the sponges for his pirate cake. No one reacts and that\u2019s probably because the cake turns out to be totally fine.\n\nWhen time runs out, there\u2019s a lot of fondant (disgusting) and underneath that, some pretty good cakes. Michelle beams as the judges tell her that her Fairy Carrot Cake is \u201cfaultless\u201d and a far cry from that tough fruit cake in the signature challenge. Helena also manages to redeem herself and her bat cake with a stunning chocolate cake with dried coconut grass, chocolate bark, and chocolate buttercream. (The judges then tell Priya her chocolate cake would be good if it weren\u2019t worse than Helena\u2019s. Ouch.) Rounding out the top three is David, whose not-so-healthy chocolate-orange snake cake looks as good as it tastes. It\u2019s his first great bake after being solidly middle-of-the-pack until now.\n\nThe judges go on to tear Amelia and Phil apart, but each of them has done well enough to coast through to next week. So, it\u2019s down to Dan \u2014 the Thor-like baking god who loves to help people and has one blue eye and one brown eye \u2014 and Jamie, who thinks crying is \u201ccringey.\u201d Dan unfortunately fails to escape the disgrace of having served raw cake and a somehow flavorless passionfruit curd. Plus, Jamie\u2019s dog biscuits for humans were pretty good, so he gets to stick around for another week. Dan cries openly among his fellow bakers.\n\nAnd thus Cake Week comes to an end, leaving us extremely excited to see more bakes from Phil, Amelia, Priya, Michelle, Henry, and Steph, though we wouldn\u2019t dream of sleeping on David, Michael, or Helena, the anti-Kim-Joy. See you next week, when we dive headlong into Biscuits!", "description": "Season 10\u2019s Cake Week features rubbery sponges, a \u201cfaultless\u201d carrot cake, and an alarming number of injuries.
