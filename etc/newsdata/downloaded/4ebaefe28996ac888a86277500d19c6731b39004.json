Your Hot Girl Summer, I mean. Hopefully as Megan Thee Stallion intended when she coined the term, it was breezily unselfconscious, body positive, full of outdoor drinking sessions and fun selfies. As the 24-year-old rapper posted on Twitter back in July: \u201cBeing a Hot Girl is about being unapologetically YOU, having fun, being confident, living YOUR truth, being the life of the party etc\u201d. Now, as the nights close in, there is a sense of transition in the air. What comes next?\n\nIt was a question posited by Jimmy Fallon last week, when the Tonight Show host duetted with the rapper for a seasonal sequel, Hot Girl Fall. The answer? \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that the weather may be getting cooler but we\u2019re just heating up,\u201d Megan explained, before listing the many ways in which you could bring the Hot Girl attitude to autumn (turtle necks, turkey, wine, new stationery, pumpkins, flu shots). Supporting this theory further was the long-awaited September drop of Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s video for the original single. Hot Girl Summer ft Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign was first teased in a tweet in July, but we didn\u2019t get to see Megan and Nicki\u2019s pool-lounger twerking until 3 September, the traditional summer cut-off in the US.\n\nThen Hustlers \u2013 surely Hot Girl Summer in celluloid form \u2013 didn\u2019t come out until 10 days after that. The film features cameos from ultimate hotties Cardi B and Lizzo, but stars Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu as scamming strippers, who use their wiles to keep the party going even after the markets crash in 2008; real hot girl shit, as Megan would say. Lopez \u2013 still an undeniable Hot Girl, at 50 \u2013 spends much of the movie in skimpy outfits that would fit right in at Nicki\u2019n\u2019Meg\u2019s pool party. Notably, though, when taking rooftop ciggie breaks, she covers up with a floor-length chinchilla coat, large enough to also envelop stripper newbies like Wu\u2019s character. That\u2019s one way to keep a girl hot, even after the sun goes down.\n\nFor some, though, the onset of cold weather will always signal the start of Cuffing Season, that period from October to March when everyone wants a significant other to snuggle with. Luckily there\u2019s a get-out clause for those guys, too: \u201cIf you are cuffed up, you can still have a hot girl summer,\u201d Megan advised in a recent red-carpet interview. With one proviso: \u201cBut you still gotta be on your bullshit.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re happy with the general Hot Girl vibe, but require a seasonally appropriate title change, then the continuity candidate is \u201cThotumn\u201d. It\u2019s a pleasing portmanteau \u2013 autumn and \u201cthot\u201d, a reclaimed slang term for a woman who likes sex \u2013 that\u2019s currently riding high on Instagram. If, however, you\u2019re the sort of person who gets grumpy about seeing fairy lights in shops in November, that won\u2019t do at all. You\u2019ll need a distinctly new mood for the new month.\n\nIt might be simplest to start with what\u2019s definitely not coming next. Like \u201cChristian Girl Autumn\u201d. This mini-meme was born on 10 August when a 19-year-old self-described troll from Long Island Google-image-searched the terms \u201ccute church outfits\u201d and \u201call scarf outfits\u201d. He came up with a photograph of two perfectly coiffed white women posing side-by-side during a shopping trip and posted it along with a few red leaf emojis and the caption: \u201cHot Girl Summer is coming to an end, get ready for Christian Girl Autumn\u201d.\n\nWhen the replies took off \u2013 along the lines of: \u201cThis picture asked to speak to my manager\u201d and, \u201cThis picture asked me not to kiss another man in public and if I could please leave the restaurant\u201d \u2013 the tweet eventually got back to the photo\u2019s real subjects. These were lifestyle bloggers Emily Gemma and Caitlin Covington, who objected to their depiction as clueless homophobes, but eventually got in on the joke, giving the story its happy ending. As Gemma told BuzzFeed: \u201cI think people realised that not all white girls who love fall fashion and pumpkin spice are what we\u2019re all categorised to look like.\u201d\n\nThen there is \u201cHot Boy Summer\u201d. The equivalent of #AllLivesMatter or a Straight Pride parade, it is also therefore a hard \u201cno\u201d. Nah, nope, never gonna happen. Next! Not least because, as has been made clear by Tom Hanks in a sassily front-tied shirt or Tony Soprano on a lime-green lilo, men too enjoyed their Hot Girl Summer and have no need of a heavily gendered follow-up. The same goes for Soft Boi Autumn, suggested to coincide with Bon Iver\u2019s 30 August album release date.\n\nIn terms of gender politics, Sad Girl Fall is a better shout. Elle magazine called it earlier this month, in a trend report characterised by sombre transition. We were informed that \u201cskin-tight mini dresses have evolved into voluminous gowns, cycling shorts have morphed into slouchy suits and vibrant neons have dulled to dark hues.\u201d Sad Girl Autumn makes sense, but it doesn\u2019t exactly pop with positivity, does it?\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is not so much a pendulum swing as a stylistic shift. During a discussion of her future plans in mid-August, Megan Thee Stallion herself suggested Hot Nerd Fall, which, crucially, still has the word \u201chot\u201d in it. \u201cEveryone knows I\u2019m still in college,\u201d she told Access Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a real hot girl semester, you know what I\u2019m saying? Real Hot Nerd Fall, so I\u2019m just about to start puttin\u2019 on for all my school girls.\u201d\n\nHowever, for Ashley Perna, a writer and comedian from Ontario, Canada, it\u2019s the \u201chot\u201d part that rankles. She\u2019s been tweeting instead about Awkward Woman Autumn: \u201cNothing at all against hot girl summer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I definitely don\u2019t always feel \u2018hot\u2019. Awkward Woman Autumn is about embracing what makes us unique style-wise while also being comfortable in our clothes \u2026 For example, I love the shape of my legs but not how pale they are. Autumn means tights, which is perfect for me!\u201d\n\nSome Hot Girl Summer follow-ups take the \u201chot\u201d and run with it; others are all about the \u201cgirl\u201d. Some embrace self-love, while others find \u201cself-acceptance\u201d a more obtainable seasonal goal. The important thing is that there is a decent selfie-posting excuse in there somewhere. Otherwise, what even is the point?\n\nWhich brings us to \u201cModern Non-Binary Slag Harvest Time\u201d, a concept introduced by singer and musician Shy Charles in a September Instagram post. Charles envisages this as a time to \u201ctake your lover to a pumpkin field\u201d then post a selfie \u201cwearing warm autumnal hues\u201d. Why \u201cModern\u201d? \u201cIt is important to be as modern as you can, to really get the edge and participate in creating the culture of your own generation,\u201d they explain. Why \u201cHarvest Time\u201d? \u201cWe all need to ground ourselves with an earthy vibe and also practise gratitude.\u201d And the \u201cNon-Binary Slag\u201d part is self-evident: \u201cBeing neither man nor woman (or both), liking a good time and not caring who knows it; what\u2019s not to love?!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s only one thing, and that\u2019s the fact that Hot Girl Summer has to end. We can accept the changing of the seasons, but it\u2019s a shame if the Black Girl Magic and body positivity of summer 2019 are dismissed as passing trends. And if that seems a lot of analysis for a selfie hashtag, so be it. Overthinking things is very \u201cHot Nerd Fall\u201d, y\u2019know.", "description": "Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s anthem of carefree confidence has transitioned into a mantra for any season", "authors": ["Ellen E Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8490db310b4b974c102ed9b8e8f88d7bfa0db642/28_366_3832_2299/master/3832.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=67b0e3496c33f32e2f0fc2711eae0673", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
