The man also told the Daily Mail it takes him roughly 30 minutes to dress his sores each day. He is also reluctant to leave home, as he often is subject to stares and comments from other people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely ruined my life, I feel like a prisoner in my own home. I\u2019ve said to myself that I look like a zombie,\u201d Young said.\n\n\"It's the worst pain I've ever felt in my life,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only way to describe it is that it's like someone sticking in knives at various points across your body continuously.\u201d\n\nPG is a rare inflammatory skin disorder that affects an estimated 1 in 100,000 people in the U.S., according to the National Organization of Rare Disorders. Those with PG develop red bumps and blisters that eventually form into swollen, open sores.\n\n\u201cThe size and depth of the ulcerations vary greatly, and they are often extremely painful,\u201d the organization states.\n\nThe cause of PG is unknown, but those with underlying health conditions \u2013 namely autoimmune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease \u2013 are more likely to develop it.\n\nYoung told the outlet he first noticed sores forming on his face in December 2017, but it took months before he received the PG diagnosis. In the interim, the ulcers on his face, chest, arms continued to form and did not go away with various antibiotic treatments.\n\nTreatment for the condition \u2013 which can\u2019t totally be prevented, according to the Mayo Clinic \u2013 does exist. Different medications, such as corticosteroids and steroid-sparing drugs, are often used to control a patient\u2019s PG. But even with treatment, \u201cit\u2019s common for new wounds to develop,\u201d the clinic states.\n\nTICK-BORNE ILLNESS THAT CAN CAUSE BRAIN INFLAMMATION DETECTED IN UK FOR THE FIRST TIME: OFFICIALS\n\n\u201cI've tried all sorts of medication and nothing seems to work,\u201d he said, noting he\u2019s gained weight as a result of the steroids he takes for PG.\n\n\u201cAll I want is to live a normal life and get back to work. For the condition to go away would be the world's best Christmas present,\u201d added Young. \"It would be a breath of fresh air.\u201d", "description": "A 32-year-old British man says he feels like a \u201czombie\u201d due to a rare condition that causes painful, pus-filled sores to form on his face and various parts of his body.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
