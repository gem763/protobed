It was so hard for me because my parents have been my No. 1 supporters when it comes to my hijab.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt was like your worst nightmare to have to compete and then find out that you got disqualified, and it\u2019s because of something that you love. Why should you have to sacrifice your religion and a part of who you are to run, to do another thing that you\u2019re very passionate about?\u201d\n\nOhio High School Athletic Association spokesperson Tim Stried confirmed Noor was disqualified for her hijab but said it was because she didn\u2019t submit a waiver to wear it.\n\n\u201cCross country runners may participate in competitions with religious headwear, provided the runner has obtained a waiver from the OHSAA and submitted it to the head official before the race, since it is a change to the OHSAA uniform regulations,\u201d Mr. Stried said. \u201cThe official was simply enforcing this rule since a waiver had not been submitted.\u201d\n\nWhile Noor said she has obtained a waiver to wear her hijab in future events without being barred, she doesn\u2019t think a waiver is \u201crespectful\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cI feel happy that I\u2019m racing on Saturday and my time is going to count, I\u2019m happy to follow the rules,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that the whole letter thing and having to inform people that I\u2019m coming is proper or respectful to myself.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
