The image depicted a tied noose over a black background, with a caption printed in all caps at the top of the photo.\n\n\"IF WE WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE EVIL PEOPLE FEAR PUNISHMENT AGAIN,\" the caption read.\n\nCanning was served with a formal complaint regarding the post on May 7, 2019, and he stepped down less than two months later. He said in his resignation letter he felt he was being \"coerced into resigning.\"\n\nAlthough \"Make America Great Again\" is an official campaign slogan used by President Trump, Canning said he did not interpret the post as having any association with the president's politics. The judge described himself as a Democrat, telling the New York Times, \"There is not a man that I could despise more than Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut the conduct commission disagreed with that assessment. Commission administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian criticized Canning's post both for its political nature and for its invocation of historically racist symbols.\n\n\"The noose is an incendiary image with repugnant racial connotations. It is the very antithesis of law and justice,\" Tembeckjian said in the commission's statement. \"For a judge to use the image of the noose in making a political point undermines the integrity of the judiciary and public confidence in the courts.\"\n\nCanning said he simply thought the post was supporting the death penalty and that he didn't mean to make any point beyond that.\n\n\"The post was not racist. I\u2019m not a racist guy,\u201d he told the New York Times. \"I see it as pro-death penalty, pro-capital punishment. It doesn't need to be a noose; it could have been a gas chamber. It could have been an electric chair.\"\n\nCanning, who said he was encouraged to run for the position of justice because \"it didn\u2019t seem like anyone wanted to run,\" was originally set to serve until 2021. The role, which is not a full-time job, pays $8,702 per year.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Canning apologized for the effect his actions had on the town.\n\n\"It has been a pleasure serving this town as one of its justices, and I will greatly miss my duties,\" he wrote. \"l do formally apologize for the inconvenience and hardship that I have imposed on my co-justice and the Town of Altona.\"", "description": "A New York judge has been forced to step down after posting an image of a noose captioned with the words \"Make America Great Again\" to his Facebook page.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7R8U1bujNxBbvzWcOOwIBg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/4185x2744+557+54/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-07/6ad5bbe0-9f6b-11e9-addd-72cc93ef215d", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
