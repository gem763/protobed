With effective treatment, the virus cannot be passed on.\n\nOther than waking at 06:00 to take a single pill every day and visiting the hospital for blood tests every six months, the condition has little impact on day-to-day life for Thomas, 45.\n\nOn the contrary, plans to take part in an Ironman challenge on Sunday, which has involved him learning to swim, were to Thomas a way of demonstrating his physical and mental strength.\n\n\"When I first found out that I was going to have to live with HIV, the first thing I thought was straight away: I was going to die,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not like I blame people for not knowing this.\n\n\"This is a subject that because of the 80s scenarios people don't talk about it because that's the only information they have.\"\n\nHe added: \"The overriding question that everybody said to me - the first question everyone says to me when I tell them I'm living with HIV - is 'Are you going to be OK?'\n\n\"And it's a really compassionate question to ask. But, this is meant the nicest way possible, it's a really uneducated question.\"\n\nThomas said revealing that he is living with HIV was similar to coming out as gay in 2009 because of \"the fear, the hiding, the secrecy, the not knowing how people are going to react\".\n\n\"But I think when it was all about my sexuality it just seemed like there was more empathy and more understanding because you had more knowledge, because you could turn on the telly and you could see that there was LGBT representation on most platforms.\"\n\nImage copyright Christian Liewig/Corbis/Getty Images Image caption Gareth Thomas (right) is tackled by Sebastien Chabal of France during a match in Cardiff in 2007\n\nWho is Gareth Thomas?

He's showing that you can have HIV but you can still do the sport and the Ironman, for goodness sake.\"\n\nGetty When you have a secret that other people know about it makes you really vulnerable towards them. And I just I felt like I had no control over my own life\n\nThe documentary shows Thomas's anxiety and having to consult legal representatives after a tabloid newspaper found out about his HIV status.

And I just I felt like I had no control over my own life.\"\n\nThomas said he currently felt the strongest he had ever been in his life.\n\n\"I've had a shitty rollercoaster of a ride. My parents say to me 'Jesus Christ. What's coming next with you?'.\n\n\"I had the whole emotional challenge of revealing my sexuality and confronting the sporting stereotype within that.\n\n\"And then I felt 'I'm confronting this', which has so many similarities.\"\n\nIn the film he confides in Shane Williams, another former Wales international turned amateur triathlete and actress Samantha Womack.\n\nIn a BBC Wales interview, he explained: \"I'm trying to take control of my life, but I'm not trying to break the stigma and educate for me. Because that's really selfish.\n\n\"I'm trying to educate and break the stigma for everybody, which includes me in that everybody.\"\n\nImage copyright nito100/Getty Images Image caption The drug PrEP is being used as part of HIV prevention\n\nWhat is HIV?\n\nHIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus - the immunodeficiency is the weakening of the immune system by the virus.\n\nIt has been passed on between humans for many decades but was only identified in the early 1980s.\n\nIf left untreated, infection with HIV progresses through a series of stages, leading to late-stage HIV or Aids\n\nHIV can be passed on through blood or semen but not passed on by spitting, sneezing, coughing, kissing or general social contact.\n\npassed on by spitting, sneezing, coughing, kissing or general social contact.

Gareth is proof that a HIV diagnosis shouldn't stop you from doing anything you want to do - whatever that is.\n\n\"I hope that by speaking publicly about this, Gareth will transform attitudes towards HIV that are all too often stuck in the 1980s.\n\n\"We've made huge medical advances in the fight against HIV that means that people living with HIV like Gareth now live long healthy lives.\n\n\"We can also say without doubt that those and on effective HIV treatment can't pass on the virus.
