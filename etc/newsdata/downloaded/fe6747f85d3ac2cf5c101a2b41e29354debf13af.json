Twenty-seven seconds remained in a Week 14 game between the New York Jets and Seattle Seahawks. Seattle\u2019s 1998 playoff hopes hung in the North Jersey air. With the Jets down five, Testaverde lunged. His knee scraped turf. The ball was a half-yard short. And madness ensued.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEleven Jets, 10 Seahawks and six referees converged on a 4x4 patch of fake grass. Uncertainty reigned. Officials contradicted each other, then conferred. Mere seconds after their hands shot up in the air, signaling touchdown, CBS cut to a replay that made broadcaster Kevin Harlan exclaim: \u201cHe didn\u2019t get across \u2026 No, not even close! Not even close!\u201d\n\nAnd the NFL, in its seventh season since scrapping Instant Replay, Vol. 1, could do nothing about the injustice.\n\nThe following morning, the controversy screamed off the front page of the New York Times. The following month, Seattle had missed the playoffs by one game; head coach Dennis Erickson had been fired. The following offseason, something had to change. And it did.\n\nTwenty years later, members of the late-90s competition committee and league office remember the Testaverde play as the \u201ctipping point.\u201d As the \u201ccatalyst.\u201d In a way, analogous to Rams-Saints. The following fall, instant replay was reimplemented in the NFL. This time, it was here to stay.\n\nStory continues\n\nTwenty years later, those same members also say it has served its purpose. Which was, as former NFL vice president of officiating Dean Blandino says, \u201cto correct the obvious error in a critical situation.\u201d And has it made the NFL better?\n\n\u201cI think the answer to that,\u201d former commissioner Paul Tagliabue says, \u201cis certainly yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d adds competition committee chairman Rich McKay, \u201cyou never want the audience to not have faith in the way the game is played, and the integrity of the game. I think replay gives people that faith.\u201d\n\nBut with its 20th birthday approaching, it also has those same founding fathers concerned. \u201cWorried.\u201d Even \u201cscared.\u201d\n\n[Best to worst: Ranking the replay systems in sports]\n\nIn March, NFL team owners voted 31-1 to adopt a rule that will make pass interference reviewable. It is, Blandino says, \u201csuch a huge departure from where the league and the competition committee has been. The system was put in place to deal with objective facts. The ball hit the ground, the foot stepped out of bounds, the ball broke the plane of the goal line. And this is the first shift of that philosophy.\u201d\n\nBlandino feels it\u2019s the NFL\u2019s biggest rule chance since \u201999. Because it\u2019s replay\u2019s first true venture into the world of subjectivity.\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to go there,\u201d says former Colts president Bill Polian, who was on the late-90s competition committee that brought replay back to the league. \u201cCrossing that line into a judgement call, to me, is a line that we should not have crossed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I am scared to the dickens \u2026 I\u2019m worried about it, to be honest. Because the history,\u201d Polian says of the past two decades, \u201cis of replay creep.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a gradual shift towards an unintended commitment.\n\nThe NFL reinstituted replay in 1999. (Getty)\n\nFearing the future\n\nFifty guys at a bar. That was the hypothetical the late-90s competition committee used to consider instant replay. It became the metaphorical standard, the threshold for a reversal. Only when \u201ceverybody, all those 50 agree that that play should be reversed,\u201d should a call be overturned, McKay remembers.\n\nHis colleagues had been scarred by the NFL\u2019s ill-fated first replay experiment. From 1986-1991, all stoppages came from the booth. Some games featured double-digit reviews. The system was unchecked, insufficiently accurate, disruptive and scrapped in \u201992.\n\nSo when the debate picked back up later that decade, many involved were wary. Bengals owner Mike Brown and former Giants GM George Young led the anti-replay camp. And Young, according to others involved in the discussions, had a prescient concern: \u201cWe have a system that we want to put in place,\u201d Blandino says, paraphrasing the late executive. \u201cBut we have no way to prevent it from expanding beyond what we initially intended it to be because of where technology\u2019s gonna go.\u201d\n\nWhether replay\u2019s pioneers knew so, their groundbreaking proposal in 1999 wasn\u2019t merely a contemporary measure. It was a gateway to a broader, more powerful system. Accounts differ on how much that prospect loomed over their discussions. But it was seemingly present.\n\n\u201cSome people voted no on that exact argument,\u201d recalls McKay, a competition committee member since 1994. \u201c\u2018Hey, technology\u2019s going to get better, it\u2019s going to force us to expand replay, and therefore we should never put replay in. It will get too unruly.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember a lot of people who were anti-replay bringing that up,\u201d Blandino confirms. \u201c \u2018OK, we\u2019re trying to keep this system limited, but as technology gets better, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to maintain the system as is. It\u2019s gonna grow, and it\u2019s going to expand.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nTechnology \u2013 high-definition pictures, more cameras, zoom lenses, expeditious procedures \u2013 isn\u2019t simply an enabler of replay expansion. It\u2019s a driver. \u201cTechnology was evolving,\u201d Tagliabue explains. \u201cAs the technology got better, and the picture got better, the public was seeing a lot of things that people realized we have to see. \u2026 The fans had more and more of an expectation that there should be some way to use this in officiating.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d Polian says, \u201clike everything else in life, mission creep came along. Replay creep took place. And all of a sudden, we got mandatory reviews of every scoring play and every turnover.\u201d\n\nFor two decades, the NFL\u2019s replay system incrementally branched out. More call types became challengeable. More play types were deemed consequential enough for automatic booth review. \u201cJust like we were a little concerned about,\u201d McKay says, \u201cit\u2019s probably gone beyond what it was initially intended to be.\u201d\n\nAs the scope widened, reviews became a more common occurrence. The 1999 season brought 0.79 per game. That number had ballooned to 1.71 by 2014.\n\nBut it has nestled in at a four-year average of 1.50 since. Average game length, according to data obtained from the NFL, was actually shorter in 2018 than in 2000. The system is as efficient and as accurate as ever. \u201cInstant replay,\u201d McKay said in March, \u201cis a tool that has served us very well.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it has worked. It has righted obvious wrongs \u2013 until this past January, that is, when it couldn\u2019t right the most obvious and costly wrong of all.\n\nUntil 2019, NFL lawmakers had, more or less, confined replay to objectivity. \u201cWhen we created [the system],\u201d Polian remembers, \u201cwe said, \u2018We will never review judgement calls.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut the non-pass interference call in the NFC championship game and the uproar that stemmed from it pushed the league across the line. Subjectivity wooed it.\n\n\u201cAnd when you get into the world of subjective, there\u2019s no way 50 people at a bar are going to agree,\u201d McKay says. \u201cIt\u2019s somebody\u2019s judgement vs. somebody else\u2019s judgement. And that\u2019s an interesting area.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily a harmful one. The threshold for overturning pass interference calls and non-calls, at least in preseason, has been high. But \u201cthe creep of replay,\u201d McKay says, \u201cstill does scare me a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce we stray from correcting the obvious and egregious errors,\u201d Polian explains, \u201cand get into correcting judgement calls, we\u2019re going down a really slippery slope.\u201d\n\nThere is a fear that the NFL is going down a slippery slope with its new challenge rules. (AP)\n\nIs the new rule an overreaction?\n\nSo what if, four months from now, in the fourth quarter of a tight NFC championship game, an erroneous roughing the passer call changes the outcome? What if holding does similarly a year later?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common-sense, obvious concern,\u201d Blandino says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s gonna say, \u2018Well, you can review pass interference, why can\u2019t you review that?\u2019 So we add roughing the passer. And then the next year we add holding. Last year, there were two false starts missed on touchdown plays that were impactful. Are you going to start reviewing false starts?\u201d\n\nThe worry is that replay becomes cumbersome. Though most NFL coaches and executives support it, some, like Polian, believe it already has overstepped its bounds. And while public pressure has spurred replay forward, some fans complain that lengthy reviews interrupt the sport\u2019s flow.\n\nMcKay, the president and CEO of the Atlanta Falcons, sees those complaints in survey responses. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe how many times they talk about stoppage of the game, and how disruptive it is to them,\u201d he says of Atlantans. \u201cThere\u2019s no question you see pushback from the fans.\u201d And without fans, as Falcons owner Arthur Blank likes to say to him, \u201cwe have 22 guys playing sandlot football.\u201d\n\nThe use of replay, therefore, becomes a balancing act, serving diverse populations with diverse, often conflicting interests. Officiating perfection is desirable. But how hard do you chase perfection knowing it isn\u2019t attainable? At what point do the marginal costs of yet another replay expansion outweigh the marginal benefits?\n\nOr, as Polian puts it: \u201cIs the incremental gain worth the pain?\u201d\n\nSome believe pass interference reviews will tiptoe dangerously close to the inflection point. Whatever comes next could surpass it. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that that discussion of further expansion will continue,\u201d McKay says. Replay\u2019s \u201crole in the penalty world,\u201d he says, is the next frontier.\n\nThat the chairman of the competition committee is aware of the concerns should assuage some of them. So should the challenge system, which has kept replay in check for 20 years.\n\nStill, those responsible for bringing it to the NFL are uneasy.\n\nSays Blandino, now an officiating analyst for Fox: \u201cI don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve went this route. I\u2019ve never felt that changing a rule to fix one situation that happens every however many years \u2013 I don\u2019t think you end up with good rules that way.\u201d\n\nAnd Charley Casserly, former Redskins GM and competition committee member, current NFL Network analyst: \u201cI think the system has worked. But this is one I would\u2019ve voted against.\u201d\n\nAnd Polian, the harshest critic of the bunch: \u201cThe original second incarnation of replay was a big success. But it\u2019s gone downhill since. \u2026 There\u2019s a whole new generation of people in the league who don\u2019t remember the ills of instant replay.\n\n\u201cIt is now open season on judgement calls,\u201d he concludes. \u201cAnd in my view, that\u2019s a bad place to be.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nHenry Bushnell is a features writer for Yahoo Sports.
