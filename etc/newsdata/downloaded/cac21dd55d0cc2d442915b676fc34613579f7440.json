The survey polled 2,096 Americans about their financial health, debt, and earnings for a new series, \"The State of Our Money.\" More than 670 respondents were millennials, defined as ages 23 to 38 in 2019.\n\nRoughly a quarter of millennial respondents have a mortgage, and 41% have a car loan, the report found. Of millennial respondents with a mortgage, nearly 49.7% have some or a lot of stress about it, compared to 41.9% of overall respondents. The numbers are similar when it comes to car loans: 50.7% of millennial respondents with a car loan have some or a lot of stress about it, compared to 42.9% overall.\n\nBut millennials are most stressed about their credit card and undergrad student loan debts \u2014 51.5% and 28.4% of millennial respondents have each, respectively.\n\nOf millennials with credit card debt, nearly 68% have some or a lot of stress, whereas only 60% of overall respondents do.

A Merrill Lynch Wealth Management report, which surveyed more than 2,700 Americans ages 18 to 34, found that only 19% of respondents view financial success as being rich \u2014 60% see it as not having any debt.\n\n\"Freedom from debt seems a low bar of accomplishment, yet it's an elusive goal for many early adults,\" the report said.\n\nAccording to the report, citing the Survey of Consumer Finances, 81% of early-adult households carry a collective debt of nearly $2 trillion. The debt includes car loans and mortgages but is mainly made up of student-loan debt and credit-card debt.", "description": "Millennials are stressed about all kinds of debt \u2014 mortgage, car loans, credit card, and student loans.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daa062acc4a0a36084abb37?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
