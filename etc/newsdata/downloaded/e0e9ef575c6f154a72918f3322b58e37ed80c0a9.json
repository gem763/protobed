But without the veil of careful word selection and paraphrasing by the American media, his actual presentation was startling, she wrote in a column in The Guardian. \u201cMuch [of] the reporting of Trump necessarily edits and parses his words, to force it into sequential paragraphs or impose meaning where it is difficult to detect,\u201d she noted.\n\nTaylor listened to Trump boast about his border wall Thursday in the Otay Mesa section of San Diego. He said that \u201cyou could fry an egg on the wall,\u201d and called the slatted barrier \u201cimpenetrable.\u201d (The Washington Post described Trump\u2019s border wall rap similar to a \u201csegment on the QVC shopping channel.\u201d) He encouraged an Army Corps of Engineers official to reveal security technology, who demurred \u2014 for security reasons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read so many stories about his bluster and boasting and ill-founded attacks, I\u2019ve listened to speeches ... and yet I was still taken back by just how disjointed and meandering the unedited president could sound,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cHere he was trying to land the message that he had delivered at least something towards one of his biggest campaign promises and sounding like a construction manager with some long-winded and badly improvised sales lines.\u201d\n\nTaylor wondered if it wasn\u2019t better for the public to get the unvarnished Trump in all his garbled glory. Manipulating Trump talk to make it more understandable and succinct also serves to \u201cmask\u201d and \u201cnormalize\u201d his \u201cfull and alarming incoherence,\u201d Taylor warned.\n\nCheck out the entire column here.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
