This is a Rubicon,\" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told AFP.\n\n\"And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner.\"\n\nHong Kong's protests were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland, which fuelled fears of an erosion of liberties promised under \"one country, two systems\".\n\nAfter Beijing and local leaders took a hardline against the protesters, they snowballed into a wider movement calling for more democratic freedoms and police accountability.\n\nProtesters have used face masks to avoid identification -- along with yellow helmets, goggles and respirators to protect themselves from tear gas and police projectiles.\n\nThe ban, which Lam said would take effect immediately, came after Hong Kong was rocked by the worst violence of the year on Tuesday, the same day China celebrated 70 years of Communist Party rule.\n\nStreet battles raged for hours between riot police and hardcore protesters.\n\nA teenager who was part of a group that attacked police with umbrellas and poles was shot in the chest with a live round -- the first such shooting since the demonstrations began.\n\nPro-establishment lawmakers and a prominent police officer association had this week ramped up their calls for the government to invoke the emergency laws, which were last used 52 years ago by the British during deadly leftist riots.\n\nThe law allows the city's leader to make \"any regulations whatsoever\" in the event of an emergency or public danger without the need to go via the city's parliament.\n\nDuring the 1967 riots -- a period where more than 50 people were killed in a year-long leftist bombing and murder spree -- the British used the emergency laws to give police extra powers of arrest and roll out widespread censorship of the press.\n\nBut critics countered that bypassing the legislature and giving Lam the power to make any law would be a slippery slope for an international finance hub that owes its economic success to its reputation for rule of law and judicial independence.\n\nIt is also not clear how a face mask ban would be enforceable.\n\nSince a deadly SARS outbreak in 2003, face masks have become ubiquitous in Hong Kong.\n\nEven moderate protesters have already shown a willingness to break the law in huge numbers, appearing at unsanctioned rallies in their tens of thousands.\n\nSimon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said a mask ban might deter some moderates from hitting the streets.\n\n\"But it could well have the effect of bringing more people out simply because they feel the need to protest against the exercise of executive authority,\" he told AFP.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Hong Kong's leader announced a ban Friday on protesters wearing face masks, invoking colonial-era emergency powers, in a bid to quell months of violent anti-government unrest.
