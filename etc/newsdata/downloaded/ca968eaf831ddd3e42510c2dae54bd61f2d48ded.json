The face says it all. It was a hard fight. I got caught a few times, it was more head clashes so it made it harder.\n\n\u201cFrom about midway through round eight to nine, I could hardly see out of my eye because of the swelling.\n\n\u201cI started getting caught with left hands because I couldn\u2019t see anything coming \u2013 it completely shut up \u2013 so it was hard to see anything from the side.\n\n\u201cThe last two rounds I was fighting on instinct and with one eye. All tactics went out of the window for the last two-and-a-half rounds and I just used all my heart and determination.\n\n\u201cI knew I had won it, but you never know what the judges will say and I was a bit nervous because I wanted it so much.\u201d\n\nTaylor, 26, paid tribute to opponent Prograis, who had recorded 24 straight wins prior to this battle of the best super-lightweights in the division.\n\n\u201cI hit him a couple of times and he never moved. He is a worthy champion and a great opponent. He definitely lived up to his reputation. All respect to Regis and I wish him all the best,\u201d Scotland\u2019s finest said.\n\nWith the Commonwealth gold medallist serenaded by the O2 Arena crowd on a number of occasions, he could have been forgiven for thinking he was in his home country.\n\nThis was London though, but the city was treated to a masterclass in maybe the fight of the year from Taylor, who used his jab smartly throughout with regularly body blows landed on Prograis.\n\nJosh Taylor and Regis Prograis (Paul Harding/PA)\n\nDespite this, the New Orleans boxer kept coming back, but the Scot had the edge and aims to fight against light welterweight champion Jose Ramirez with the Hibernian fan eyeing a clash at Easter Road.\n\nHe added: \u201cHopefully now I get the recognition I think I deserve. Everyone says I go under the radar and I kind of like that. I am not a show pony.\n\n\u201cBut I think this will take my profile to the next level. Everyone will start getting behind me now and if I get this Ramirez fight and it\u2019s abroad, hopefully I can take a travelling army.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind travelling to America and taking the support with me, but I would love it to be in Scotland. I would love it to be at Edinburgh Castle or at Easter Road, the home of my hometown football club.\u201d\n\nConfident Prograis conceded the better man won on the night, but said: \u201cNo excuses, but I will be back. I am pretty sure Josh enjoyed it, hopefully we can do part two.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s trainer Shane McGuigan paid tribute to his fighter and admitted an emotionally testing camp, where both experienced losses, helped them get to the end goal.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing. This camp hasn\u2019t been the easiest camp. Josh lost his father-in-law, my sister passed away as well, but it brought the two of us together in tough times,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDuring his tough rounds, he dug in and Josh proved he is the best fighter in the world.\n\n\u201cIn his 16th fight he is unified champion, with the Muhammad Ali Trophy and the best fighter in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Scots at 02 Arena dd not have all good news to cheer with Ricky Burns losing out to Welshman Lee Selby on a majority points decision.\n\nDerek Chisora was smiling, however, after David Price\u2019s corner chucked the towel in midway through the fourth round.\n\nVictory number 32 for the Finchley heavyweight has him dreaming of more big fights ahead.\n\nChisora added: \u201cWe will try squeeze in another one this year.\n\n\u201cEither Baby Miller, Joseph Parker, Oleksandr Usyk. Those three, I really want to get that done this year. I will speak to Eddie Hearn and we will try to push it in.\u201d", "description": "The Tartan Tornado wants to fight light welterweight champion Jose Ramirez next and would `love\u00b4 for it to be at Hibernian\u00b4s Easter Road.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/04/wire-20234614-1572150551-944_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
