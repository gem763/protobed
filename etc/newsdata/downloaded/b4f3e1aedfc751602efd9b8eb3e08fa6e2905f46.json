This time around it\u2019s building 150 through a collaboration with Cabot Coach of Haverhill, Mass.\n\nThe model has been updated for 2020 with a two-seat rear cabin that\u2019s now equipped with slots for tablets, a wireless charging pad, an ice bucket and umbrella holders in the doors.\n\nThe car is otherwise a top of the line Black Label all-wheel-drive Continental powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 and offered in black, white or a crystal blue starting at $115,470 with deliveries set to begin next spring.\n\nAfter that, the Continental\u2019s future is unclear. The automaker hasn\u2019t announced any plans, but sales were down 25 percent during the first quarter of this year, with just over 4,7000 sold, and the factory that currently produces it alongside the Ford Mustang is slated to begin manufacturing electric vehicles in 2023.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "Doubling down on its most expensive model.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
