The charming track caught the trio in a similar bind with their audience. \u201cEven when we released our second album, which was much grittier than the first, people pushed back and said: \u2018We want more Bruises,\u2019\u201d Polachek recalls.\n\nTo their credit, Chairlift never caved in. Over three albums, the trio-turned-duo easily outstripped the fast-diminishing Brooklyn indie scene of the early 2010s. She and Patrick Wimberley were as fluent in 80s Japanese pop, esoteric English songwriter Virginia Astley and opera as they were contemporary R&B; Beyonc\u00e9 ended up recording a Chairlift castoff, No Angel, on her self-titled fifth album. They split, amicably, in 2017, proud of their distinctive sound, says Polachek, if disheartened by the limited perceptions of what an indie band could become.\n\nPolachek had released a pop album as Ramona Lisa in between Chairlift\u2019s second and third albums. An ambient record, billed to CEP, followed their split. The shifting names, she says, offered conceptual limitations that guided her work. Pang, her first album under her own name, arrives free from such scaffolding \u2013 so much so that it was never supposed to exist. Thankfully, it does: it\u2019s among the year\u2019s finest experimental pop albums, blending acoustic and synthetic textures into a surrealist yet affecting listen. Co-producers Polachek and PC Music alumnus Danny L Harle wield elegance and precision worthy of a sushi master, or peak-pop Peter Gabriel.\n\nAfter Chairlift split, Polachek felt her life lacked structure. \u201cI figured I would just try a bit of everything,\u201d she says over lunch in Paris last month. She\u2019s here for fashion week and her outfit suggests someone at home there: a leather vest over a blousy white shirt that makes Polachek, with her striking, almond-shaped face and wide eyes, look like a modish Joan of Arc, whereas I would look like an employee at a medieval-themed restaurant. In summer 2017, she was in LA to write songs with Harle, the idea being to pitch them to Katy Perry. A magic-mushroom trip made her second-guess her plans. \u201cI remember thinking: what I do with my time right now is really going to determine what happens next,\u201d she recalls in her cut-glass accent. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be wasting my time on things that I don\u2019t care passionately about.\u201d\n\nWhen she called Harle to cancel, he suggested they write for her instead. Polachek had been making a \u201cwarmer, auburn, folk-tinged, peaceful\u201d album titled Calico that she didn\u2019t see working with the hard, shiny, electronic sound Harle was known for. Still, she agreed. Perhaps inevitably, they came up with something that overshadowed Calico and kickstarted a fruitful collaboration. Their first song, Parachute, \u201cis about a total loss of control,\u201d says Polachek. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not giving that control up to another person, it\u2019s giving it up to life \u2013 and that\u2019s the scariest thing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Like a peak-pop Peter Gabriel ...

Polachek had been experiencing inexplicable adrenal rushes that stopped her from sleeping and accelerated her metabolism. She called them \u201cpangs\u201d and sought to recreate the sensation in her sessions with Harle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell if my excitement about all these musical breakthroughs was triggering my body,\u201d she says, \u201clike I was manufacturing drugs internally.\u201d Six months later, her marriage of four years ended. \u201cAll these structures that had seemed essential to my identity and my time fell away,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything happened very fast. I felt a giant shift within myself that caught me by surprise. As much as I fought against it, I had to learn that the body knows more than we do.\u201d\n\nPolachek had felt rooted in New York in her relationship. Then she experienced \u201cwhat Joni Mitchell calls the hejira, this need to fly to another place,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of the music comes out of that conflict of wanting this other thing and feeling guilty about wanting it, and then it guiding me somewhere despite my kicking and screaming.\u201d She is opaque about the relationship \u201cout of respect for privacy\u201d, she says carefully, welling up a bit. Following those impulses entailed \u201ca digestion of shame and self-questioning that, nonetheless, led to a resolution that things would be OK\u201d. She felt she was running towards something rather than away from it, although she admits she felt burdened by \u201ca crystallised idea of what the world was\u201d in New York \u2013 even though the Brooklyn heyday was over, she still saw the same faces on the street every day. \u201cI felt like it was a weight that was always on whatever I did.\u201d\n\nShe is more cutting in her lyrics, which repeatedly touch on being asked to change her nature. \u201cWhen I stop caring, you stop caring,\u201d she sings on I Give Up, which crests on a frustrated heave of a chorus. (Polachek describes her music brilliantly: \u201cThe whole song is an expression of apathy, and I wanted it to feel like something was being chucked really hard.\u201d) She had never written that plainly before, though it came easily. \u201cChairlift felt like a comfort blanket because Patrick and I were like brother and sister,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut it subconsciously imposed a platonic neutrality over everything we did, which stopped me from approaching things with a certain emotional intensity. I wanted to make sure he felt like he could get behind everything.\u201d\n\nPolachek has found transitioning into a solo career easier than expected, it bringing new fans who hadn\u2019t followed Chairlift. \u201cI felt the perception of what I was doing as \u2018indie\u2019 was going to travel with me, but it hasn\u2019t at all, which is really exciting,\u201d she says. Aged 34 and with 12 years in a band behind her, she had worried about being a late starter, a notion she made herself reject. \u201cI\u2019m just beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cI think women are taught in the music industry that once you\u2019re 35, you\u2019ve expired, and I\u2019m here to prove that factually incorrect.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just so much more public female intellect on display now than there ever has been Caroline Polachek\n\nThe week we meet, Polachek tweets that her new album had marked the first time that journalists asked about her vision, not her appearance. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much more public female intellect on display now than there ever has been,\u201d she says when I ask why that might be. \u201cYoung people have realised that an artist is in charge of what they\u2019re doing \u2013 this crazy cynicism that artists were puppets has disappeared. They have [music production software] Ableton Live and know how hard it is to write a song.\u201d\n\nIf Polachek clings to any vestiges of the late-00s Brooklyn scene, it\u2019s that DIY mindset: she directs her videos and recently started her own imprint within Sony, Perpetual Novice. \u201cI do way more of my own stuff than I should be at this point,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m so obsessed with doing it myself.\u201d Although in person her thoughtful answers and clarity evince academic-level focus, she describes herself as \u201ceasily distractible\u201d, always divided between four different endeavours; even this short stay in Paris has produced a possible new musical collaboration. Not only does Polachek not want to know what other people think she should be doing, she doesn\u2019t want to preordain it herself. \u201cI want to keep different options for different futures open all the time.\u201d", "description": "After 12 years in the Brooklyn indie band Chairlift \u2013 and a magic mushroom epiphany \u2013 Polachek has produced one of the year\u2019s finest experimental pop albums", "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b75d83a9781494abc6d4d5c7ec305ca5aeca13b/393_477_2968_1779/master/2968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da54f46f7e06ed2eaa3e2bd53cf1ded7", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
