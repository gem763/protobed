Bernard Sanders of Vermont has led the charge on Medicare for All, pushing a bill that would virtually eliminate private health insurance over four years.\n\nOthers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have endorsed the idea.\n\nMr. Buttigieg, meanwhile, has made the case that voters should ultimately have the choice between private health care and a Medicare for All system.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
