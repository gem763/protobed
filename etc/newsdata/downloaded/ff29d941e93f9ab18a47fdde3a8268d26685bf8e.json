We can't afford to let that happen again,\" Huntsman wrote.\n\n\"Smart diplomacy thus far has managed to keep us from war, but I worry the current estrangement will limit our options for strategic engagement in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly criticized U.S. sanctions as counterproductive and said its own actions were in line with international law.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Balmforth and Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Katya Golubkova and Bernadette Baum)", "description": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Days after ending his term in Moscow, former United States ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman has urged Washington to review its sanctions-dominated approach to Russia, questioning its efficiency and calling for dialogue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
