Led By Donkeys/via REUTERS\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson scrambled on Friday to persuade doubters to rally behind his last-minute European Union divorce deal in an extraordinary vote in parliament due on Saturday.\n\nCrowdfunded campaign group Led By Donkeys released helicopter footage showing a tractor putting the finishing touches on 40-metre (130-foot) high letters plowed into a field belonging to an anti-Brexit farmer in the county of Wiltshire in southwest England.\n\nIn the video here a voter identified as Lisa says she opted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum but has since changed her mind.\n\n\u201cPeople say to me about 17.4 million people voted for this and that\u2019s what they want. I\u2019m one of those 17.4 million and that is not what I want, that is not what I voted for. I want vote my back. I\u2019ve had my vote stolen and I want it back.\u201d\n\nBritons voted by 52%-48% to leave the EU in 2016.\n\nOne of the four founders of the campaign, Olly Knowles, said opinion polls showed Britain no longer wanted to leave the European Union.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson may have a deal but he doesn\u2019t have the support of the public....The will of the people has changed.\u201d\n\nHowever, opinion polls have shown only minor fluctuations in voters\u2019 views on Brexit since the 2016 referendum and the outcome of any second referendum remains difficult to predict. Much would hinge on turnout.", "description": "Anti-Brexit campaigners have plowed a protest message in giant letters reading \"Britain now wants to remain\" into a field in rural southern England, as Britain's exit from the European Union hangs on a knife edge.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442260179&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H10J", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
