(AP) - Jonathan Taylor ran for 119 yards and his 11th touchdown of the season, Wisconsin got two scores from its defense, and the eighth-ranked Badgers remained unbeaten with a 24-15 win over Northwestern on Saturday.\n\nTaylor carried 26 times to help Wisconsin (4-0, 2-0 Big Ten) avenge its 31-17 loss to the Wildcats last season. The junior reached 100 yards rushing for the 26th time in 31 career games and moved into fourth place on the Badgers\u2019 career rushing list (4,730).\n\nAfter allowing 81 yards rushing through the first three games, the Wisconsin defense surrendered 97 yards on the ground to Northwestern (1-3, 0-2).\n\nThe Badgers\u2019 defense sacked backup quarterback Aidan Smith once and starter Hunter Johnson three times, including one by safety Eric Burrell that caused a fumble by Johnson in the end zone. Matt Henningsen recovered to make it 14-3 in the third quarter for Wisconsin. Noah Burks added the other after intercepting Smith and returning it 68 yards down the Wisconsin sideline.\n\nJohnson went 10-for-21 and Smith completed 8 of 19 passes and had a late 15-yard touchdown to JJ Jefferson. Drake Anderson had 16 carries for 69 yards and a 4-yard score for the defending Big Ten West champion Wildcats, who dropped their second straight game conference game.\n\nCharlie Kuhbander added a 29-yard field goal for Northwestern.\n\nChris Orr had two sacks and Collin Wilder added another for a Badgers\u2019 defense that is allowing just 7.3 points per game through the first four contests.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNorthwestern: Defensively, the Wildcats, like last season, made it hard for the Wisconsin offense. But a loose offensive line and a lack of production at the quarterback position will continue to haunt the Wildcats\u2019 offense.\n\nWisconsin: Jack Coan won his sixth straight start, but needed the Badgers\u2019 defense to have a big day to overcome a lackluster day. The defense responded, as Coan finished 15-for-21 with 113 yards and an interception by Northwestern defensive back JR Pace.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWith one of the top running backs in the history of college football and a stout defense, No. 8 Wisconsin continues to prove it is one of the top teams in the country and deserves to be on the short list of teams that can seriously contend for a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\nTOP-10 BADGERS\n\nWisconsin now has won five straight against Northwestern when ranked in the top 10 of The Associated Press Top 25 poll .\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorthwestern: Plays Nebraska on Oct. 5 on the road.\n\nWisconsin: Hosts Kent State on Oct. 5.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\n-For more AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP- (edited)\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jonathan Taylor ran for 119 yards and his 11th touchdown of the season, Wisconsin got two scores from its defense, and the eighth-ranked Badgers remained unbeaten with a 24-15 win over Northwestern on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/northwestern_wisconsin_football_31480_c0-217-5184-3239_s1770x1032.jpg?8b8f23121690e0737bdb7f9c933479ff63e997a3", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
