Throughout three major design iterations, that\u2019s been the driving message behind the Surface. Last year\u2019s Surface Pro 3 represented the best execution on that idea yet. It showed that if you were willing to make some compromises, you could certainly have a tablet device that replaces your laptop in many ways. (It also has spawned a litany of copycat designs from HP, Dell, Lenovo, and others. Even Apple is about to get into the pro tablet fray .) This year, Microsoft is putting that fight behind it. It\u2019s no longer trying to sell the idea that a tablet can replace your laptop. If you want a true laptop, Microsoft is now more than happy to sell you one. So the Surface Pro 4 is different. Not in the ways you might think \u2014 it\u2019s shockingly similar to the Surface Pro 3 in design, appearance, and functionality. Rather, the Surface Pro 4 casts aside the burden of being Microsoft\u2019s lone vision for personal computing, and now it can just be the best Surface it can be. This isn\u2019t the Surface that will convince you a tablet is better than your laptop. This is the Surface for the people that are already convinced.\n\nThe Surface Pro 4 is so similar in appearance and design to last year\u2019s Surface Pro 3 that only the most trained eye could distinguish them. It has the same overall shape and footprint, from its infinitely adjustable kickstand to its warm grey magnesium finish. It\u2019s a familiar and signature look, and using it two generations in a row establishes both a brand and visual identity for Microsoft\u2019s computers. The hardware changes are minor, but welcome There are some hardware tweaks, but you have to really hunt to find them. The Pro 4 is imperceptibly lighter than the 3, ever so slightly thinner, and has a slightly larger display. (The overall height and width of the tablet itself remain the same thanks to smaller bezels around that display.) It\u2019s still very much a full-featured Windows 10 PC in a light and portable package. It also still works much better on your desk than on your lap or an airplane tray table. (I\u2019m tempted to liken the Pro 3 and the Pro 4 to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S; yes, there are differences between them when you compare a spec sheet, but in practical use, they are the same experience.) Just because the Surface Pro 4 doesn\u2019t look or feel much different than the Pro 3 doesn\u2019t mean Microsoft has been sitting back doing nothing for the past 18 months. Instead of going back to the design drawing board, Microsoft focused on improving how you actually interact with the Surface.\n\nThe biggest improvement comes with the new Type Cover, which, sadly, still isn\u2019t included with the Surface and requires you to spend another $130 to get it. But if you buy a Surface Pro 4, you\u2019ll definitely want to budget for the Type Cover. It has completely redesigned keys and a brand-new trackpad that Microsoft says is 40 percent larger than before. The keys are raised and separated, like you'd find on a standard laptop keyboard, and are much better to type on than the flat, condensed keys of earlier Type Covers. They have nice travel and really aren\u2019t bad, but they still don\u2019t provide the same experience as a true laptop keyboard. There\u2019s also that weird hollow sound when you hammer on them because the keyboard is actually lifted up off the surface of your desk or table. The trackpad on older Type Covers has always been a miserable experience: too small, not smooth, and just plain frustrating to use. The new one is much better: it\u2019s fast and smooth to scroll with, and the larger size makes it much easier to do all of those cool Windows 10 multi-finger gestures. Compared to the trackpad on any Mac laptop or even Microsoft\u2019s Surface Book, however, it\u2019s still very small, and navigating around with it feels very cramped. Fortunately, the Pro 4\u2019s display is still a touchscreen, and I found myself reaching up from the keys to touch something on the screen much more often than reaching back to the trackpad. And then there\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s brand new Surface Pen, which provides yet another way to interact with the computer (and is actually included in the box with the Pro 4, unlike the Type Cover). The Pen works with new technology in the Pro 4\u2019s display to provide a better writing experience than the older version. It\u2019s pressure sensitive (1,024 levels, to be exact), has a really great drag on the screen, and feels more like writing with a real pen than ever before. I\u2019m no artist, and it still may not work for demanding sketchers, but I like it a lot for discretely taking notes. The other cool thing about the Pen is that it now includes an eraser on its top side that lets you quickly erase whatever it is you just wrote or scribbled. It\u2019s very easy and natural to use. The Pen will also now magnetically snap to the side of the Pro 4, which is great for storing it while the computer is on your desk, but terrible when you toss the Pro 4 in a bag and the pen pops off and settles to the bottom with all of the old gum wrappers, lint, and other detritus.\n\nAll of those improvements go toward making the Surface Pro 4 experience better, but they don\u2019t address the compromises you have to make when you choose a Surface instead of a more traditional laptop. The Pro 4\u2019s design is very compact and eminently portable, but it\u2019s still awkward to use on my lap, whether I\u2019m sitting on a chair or sitting on the floor. It\u2019s also difficult to use on a cramped airplane tray table thanks to its unusually long footprint. And it can\u2019t be picked up from a desk with one hand when it\u2019s open (like you can with a laptop) as the attached keyboard will just flop around awkwardly until you close it. None of these things are new or different with the Pro 4, but they are all things to keep in mind if you\u2019re considering a Surface. The Pro 4 doesn't address the compromises in this design The Pro 4 is also just as awkward to use in tablet mode as the Pro 3, and though Windows 10 lets you switch between desktop and tablet mode easily, I found myself leaving it in desktop mode with windowed apps most of the time. It\u2019s an old story, but true tablet apps are still lacking for Windows, and many of the apps I use on the platform are designed for the desktop environment. There\u2019s also the fact that though it\u2019s lighter and thinner than the Pro 3, at 1.73lbs, the Pro 4 is still a big device and not something that can easily be held up in one hand for extended periods. While I may use an iPad to do a lot of reading during my commute, the Pro 4 doesn\u2019t really work that well for that purpose.\n\nInside, the Pro 4 has gotten the usual processor spec bump, including sixth-generation Intel Core chips. The base model, which is priced at $899, has a Core M chip (similar to, but newer than the one in Apple\u2019s MacBook) and 4GB of RAM, while more expensive versions can be specced out with Core i5 or Core i7 processors and up to 16GB of RAM. The unit I\u2019ve been testing is priced at $1,299 and has a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. If you really want something that can work as a laptop replacement, you\u2019re probably going to want to pony up for at least this model. I haven\u2019t had any performance issues when using the Pro 4 in my daily work, which consists of a lot of web browsing, Twitter, Slack, and email, with the occasional photo editing. Windows 10 is swift and snappy, and there hasn\u2019t been a point where I\u2019ve really felt like I\u2019ve maxed out the machine\u2019s limits. (To be fair, I\u2019ve used the Surface Pro 3 quite a bit, and I haven\u2019t noticed a big a performance difference between the two in real-world use.) Performance and battery life are similar to the Pro 3 Battery life in normal use has been on par with the Pro 3 as well, lasting me about 5 hours or so between charges. The Pro 4 went for 6 hours and 37 minutes in our rundown test, which is about an hour less than the Pro 3 managed. Neither is what I\u2019ve come to expect from a premium laptop, and the Pro 4 still lags in this area. I still adore the Pro 4\u2019s tiny little charging brick, which also gives me a USB port to charge my always-thirsty smartphone. Windows 10, which is now available for every Surface save for the ill-fated and oft-forgotten Surface RT, works well on the Pro 4, though it still feels like a work in progress. Since Windows 10 launched earlier this summer, Microsoft has been fixing a lot of bugs and issues, but there are still a number that crop up in my daily workflow. For example, the standard Mail and Calendar apps continue to have trouble syncing with my Google Apps account, and the Microsoft Store often crashes. These are rather specific bugs, and I wouldn\u2019t consider either of them show stoppers, but I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t note them. I\u2019d still rather have Windows 10, bugs and all, than Windows 8.1.", "description": "For three years, Microsoft has been trying to convince us that a tablet can replace our laptops.
