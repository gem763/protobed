Elizabeth Warren wants to spend $3 trillion of your tax dollars to clean the Earth", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "How much is clean air realty worth?\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIf you are presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, it is worth $3 trillion.\n\nThe Democratic presidential hopeful unveiled her new clean energy plan to save the environment today and was revealed with a nod to several ideas from former rival, Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA), who dropped out of the Democratic field two weeks ago after positioning himself as the \"climate candidate.\"\n\n\u201cToday I\u2019m embracing that goal by committing to adopt and build on Governor Inslee\u2019s 10-year action plan to achieve 100% clean energy... and I\u2019m challenging every other candidate for President to do the same,\u201d she wrote while announcing her new environmental plan.\n\nWarren would like to commit the United States, according to her new plan published on website Medium, to using fully clean energy over the next ten years. That includes zero emissions and clean energy for cars, buildings, manufacturers and more.\n\n\u201cThe science is clear,\u201d Warren explains her reasoning behind this massive plan as Hurricane Dorian rages towards the Carolinas. \u201cThe world\u2019s leading experts have long known that climate change is caused by human beings, it is here, and it is accelerating. We already see its effects \u2014 record floods, devastating wildfires, 100-year storms that happen every year \u2014 costing lives, causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damage\u2026 This is an emergency, and without rapid and widespread change, we will soon be unable to prevent the worst harms.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m announcing I\u2019ll commit an additional $1 trillion over 10 years \u2014 fully paid for by reversing Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and giant corporations,\u201d Warren said that her plan will cost the government \"a federal investment of $3 trillion\" and \"will leverage additional trillions in private investment and create millions of jobs.\u201d\n\nSo what will Americans get exactly for this hefty price tag?\n\nWarren's plan includes:\n\n100% zero-carbon pollution for all new commercial and residential buildings by 2028\n\n100% zero emissions for all new light-duty passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks, and all buses by 2030\n\n100% renewable and zero-emission energy in electricity generation by 2035, with an interim target of 100% carbon-neutral power by 2030.\n\nWarren is also targeting car companies in her plan. \u201cIn my first year in office, I\u2019ll set strict vehicle emissions standards that will become progressively tighter every year, reaching a requirement for 100% zero-emissions for all new light- and medium-duty vehicles by 2030.\u201d\n\nNot only will she require the cars to be friendly to the environment but she will impose stricter regulations on the plants that manufacture new vehicles. \u201cI\u2019ll provide federal investments to grow domestic zero-emission vehicle manufacturing and reinforce the assembly plants and supply base, including battery manufacturing.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Democratic candidate for the 2020 election also set out her plans for new building regulations, \u201cI\u2019ll create a national zero-carbon building standard by 2023, and I\u2019ll partner with states and local governments to enforce new and stronger building codes.\u201d\n\nWarren closes her arguments by reinforcing the dire need of her plans, \u201cAs president, I will take bold action to confront the climate crisis, starting on day one. The future of our planet depends on it, and we have no more time to waste.\u201d\n\nLast week Beto O'Rourke took to Medium to lay out his plan to end the trade war. Former Secretary of Housing & Urban Development, Julian Castro preceded him weighing in on protecting animals and wildlife and this marks Warren's second foray on to the social publishing platform.
