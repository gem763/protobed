Previous industry thinking had been limited to only ground transportation technology.\"\n\nAP\n\nUPS said it wants to expand its drone delivery program but did not provide a timeline.\n\n\"The company has tested drones for urgent commercial deliveries over water; funded and supported humanitarian deliveries in Africa; and tested non-urgent commercial residential delivery in rural areas with drones launched from a UPS package delivery car,\" the statement said. \"UPS Flight Forward plans, in the future, to transport other items in many industries, and future tests together with CVS represent the first foray into retail business expansion for the UPS subsidiary.\"\n\nUPS's Flight Forward is the first program to earn the FAA's Part 135 Standard certification, giving it no limits in the \"size or scope of operations,\" according UPS.\n\nLast week, CVS rival Walgreens said it would offer a pilot drone delivery service in Christiansburg, Virginia, with Wing, Google\u2019s drone delivery company.\n\nThrough the program, Walgreens said it would deliver food and beverages, over-the-counter medications and other items within minutes, but it would not include prescriptions.\n\n\u201cWith this pilot, Walgreens will be in a unique position to capitalize on the convenience of drone delivery if and when it should expand, with approximately 78 percent of the U.S. population living within five miles of a Walgreens store,\u201d Vish Sankaran, chief innovation officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., said in a statement.\n\nABC News' Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report.", "description": "CVS Health and UPS are testing a program to deliver prescription medications by drone in a plan that could result in deliveries in as little as 10 minutes after ordering.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/cvs-pharmacy-ap-mo-20181118_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
