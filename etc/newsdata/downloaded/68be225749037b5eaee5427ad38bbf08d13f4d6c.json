Shape Created with Sketch. 100-81: Century countdown 1/21 The Century countdown This week, The Independent is counting down the 100 greatest players of the 21st century. We will be revealing 20 players per day, starting with the players who ranked 100-81. 2/21 100. Yaya Toure A brilliant midfielder who had everything: skill, tenacity, power, goals, energy. His defensive capabilities brought him to the fore at Barcelona before his attacking prowess made him such a weapon for Manchester City. He won two Ligas, three Premier Leagues, one Champions League, captained Ivory Coast to the Africa Cup of Nations and was African Player of the Year four times. LO Getty Images 3/21 99. Harry Kane His raw statistics are simply phenomenal. 130 Premier League goals for Tottenham Hotspur, in just 186 appearances. 27 in 42 for England. Twice a Premier League Golden Boot winner. A World Cup Golden Boot winner. Tottenham\u2019s talisman. England\u2019s captain. And still just 26 years old. In 10 years\u2019 time, expect to see Kane in the top 20 of a similar list. LB Getty Images 4/21 98. Daniele De Rossi A ferociously competitive and combative midfield hard man, who made over 600 appearances for his beloved Roma and over 100 for his national team. A complete midfielder, who could in one passage of play win the ball, race forward and either release a team-mate with a pinpoint pass or score himself. And do not be fooled by his combustible reputation: in 2016, he placed his treasured World Cup winner's medal in the coffin of Pietro Lombardi, Italy\u2019s kit man at the tournament. LB AFP/Getty Images 5/21 97. Bastian Schweinsteiger The meticulous German orchestrated Bayern Munich's midfield to eight Bundesliga titles and a Champions League, making over 500 appearances for the club. He was also one of the leaders in Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning campaign and carried an aura in the centre of the pitch few players can claim to have replicated. TK Bongarts/Getty Images 6/21 96. Vincent Kompany It\u2019s difficult to define his importance to both Manchester City and Belgium but it\u2019s safe to say he was one of the most important players of a generation. There may well be a handful of technically better centre-backs but his intangibles were vital to the culture at club and country where there was not a legacy of winning previously. JR Getty Images 7/21 95. Karim Benzema One of the few strikers on this list who can truly claim to be the complete forward, able to play wide or central, deep linking play or on the shoulder of the last defender, with the ability to sniff out scrappy goals and score beauties too. His medal haul speaks for itself, and he is approaching 300 career goals. But for his strained relationship with the French national team, he would have scored even more. LO Getty Images 8/21 94. Sol Campbell The heartbeat of Arsenal's defence in the Invincibles season, a double-winner in 2002 and a mainstay of the England team for almost a decade, Campbell is one of the defining defensive figures of the Premier League era. TK AFP/Getty Images 9/21 93. Pepe One of the great villains of the game but a nasty, hard centre-back that would be very high on any great striker\u2019s list of defenders he least wanted to play against. While his grit and determination stand out, nobody lasts a decade at the Bernabeu without possessing exceptional quality, with three La Liga titles (which has eluded the club since his departure) and as many Champions Leagues, Zinedine Zidane would be wise to acquire a similar player now. JR Getty Images 10/21 92. Edwin van der Sar The four-time Premier League winner made over 300 appearances in England and made an enduring habit of thriving under pressure, winning the man-of-the-match award in Manchester United's Champions League final victory in 2008. TK Getty Images 11/21 91. Arturo Vidal Only the finest players in the world enjoy long and fruitful stints at clubs such as Juventus, Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Il Guerriero has matured into a splendid holding midfielder, aggressive and dominant in the middle of the pitch but equally as effective arriving late into the box to complete attacks. A hero in his native Chile, for his role in the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica victory. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 12/21 90. Angel di Maria A key player in the glorious Real Madrid side that won La Liga in 2011/12 and the Champions League two seasons later. Widely considered a flop when he left Manchester United after only one miserable season, but the Argentine completely reinvented himself at Paris Saint-Germain, the starring attraction in one of the most expensive squads ever assembled, containing the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Edinson Cavani. LB AFP/Getty Images 13/21 89. Diego Forlan A figure of fun in his early Premier League days at Manchester United, Forlan went on to have the last laugh with a stellar career both internationally with Uruguay and in Spain, where he racked up goals for Villarreal and Atletico Madrid, twice winning the European Golden Shoe. LO AFP/Getty Images 14/21 88. Radamel Falcao In his pomp Falcao was probably the best striker on the planet. In a prolific four-year spell playing for Porto and Atletico Madrid he scored 142 goals in 178 games, and had injuries not hindered his career there is little doubt that Colombia's record scorer would be much higher up this list. LO Getty Images 15/21 87. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Has excelled in a thoroughly mediocre Arsenal side for two seasons now, scoring at a rate better than a goal every other game in a side that has struggled since the departure of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. But it is primarily for his achievements at Borussia Dortmund that he makes this list. He scored close to 150 Bundesliga goals for that wonderfully attacking team \u2013 including 31 in one season \u2013 winning the Bundesliga Player of the Year and Top Goalscorer awards. There have been few strikers as rapid or as decisive in front of goal in the last two decades. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 16/21 86. Robin Van Persie One of the best left foots in Premier League history graced two of its most revered clubs, becoming a star at both Arsenal and Manchester United. The Dutchman had a penchant for the spectacular but suffered with injuries, and it is a sign of what could have been that in the two Premier League seasons he played more than 30 games, he won the Golden Boot in both. LO Getty Images 17/21 85. Carlos Tevez A real pest of a striker who thrived in the hottest atmospheres and regularly overcame adversity. He scored plenty too, 116 league goals in eight seasons with United, City and Juventus (who probably all enjoyed prime Tevez), but it was the way he would trigger his teammates by forcing the first mistake or sparking counterattacks that really made him such an invaluable player. JR Getty Images 18/21 84. Gaizka Mendieta The midfield maestro could control games and decide them too, and was at the heart of the brilliant Valencia team which reached back-to-back Champions League finals in 2000 and 2001. He became one of the most expensive players of all time when he switched to Lazio, but he would never again reach the heights that made him a legend at the Mestalla. LO Getty Images 19/21 83. Virgil van Dijk The defensive talisman cast a spell of leadership over Liverpool's 2019 Champions League-winning side and went the entire campaign without being dribbled past. Few defenders have carried such an overarching influence on any side in recent memory. TK Getty Images 20/21 82. Hernan Crespo One of the finest finishers of a generation but perhaps his best quality was his movement; particularly in the box, where nobody was more lethal at finding a yard of space and punishing opponents. Strong and an aerial threat, he was perhaps unfortunate to follow Gabriel Batistuta with Argentina, otherwise he would have been appreciated even more. Certainly as talented as Sergio Aguero and with perhaps more composure in the biggest occasions - an underrated player. JR AFP/Getty Images 21/21 81. Rio Ferdinand A gem of a centre-back, who was perhaps ahead of his time, right now he would be even more valuable due to his versatility to thrive under any manager, no matter the philosophy or style of play. Became a real winner and leader at United and formed one of the greatest partnerships in international football history alongside John Terry with England - who should have obviously achieved much more with such an outstanding foundation to their team.

JR Getty Images\n\nThey\u2019ve changed what was considered possible. That does mean, however, that it\u2019s almost impossible to reasonably assess any other career against them.\n\nWhat is an acceptable level of achievement for talent? What is talent, for that matter? They\u2019ve disrupted how we see the game as much they\u2019ve disrupted defences.\n\nConsider the career of the player probably viewed as the greatest in the world \u2013 the true wearer of the crown \u2013 before they came along. Zinedine Zidane stands out for spectacular moments \u2013 the exquisite exhibitions of Euro 2000, the victorious volley of the 2002 Champions League final, the final surge of the 2006 World Cup \u2013 rather than the running brilliance of Messi and Ronaldo.\n\nIt is the intensity of their consistency that has been so incredible. Zidane\u2019s achievements feel so staccato next to them.\n\nThe Brazilian Ronaldo\u2019s career haul of \u201ca mere\u201d one World Cup, one Spanish title, one Uefa Cup, one Cup Winners Cup and a few domestic cups meanwhile now seems rather quaint next to the way they\u2019ve claimed win after win.\n\nAnd this touches on a deeper element, which makes this complicated question even more difficult.\n\nHistorically brilliant as Messi and Ronaldo have been, they have performed in the midst of another historical change in football.\n\nTheir era has coincided with the super-club era. They have almost completely aligned, in fact, and it could be said that the two personify this era in the extremity of their numbers.\n\nLonger-term economic developments in the game led to a situation from around 2005 where a group of around 10 clubs began to attract a greater concentration of income than ever before, and thereby attract a greater concentration of football talent than ever before.\n\nIn very basic terms, it has meant the best players play in far better squads than ever before, and that there is a huge gap between them and the majority of domestic teams they play. They logically should score more and win more. They have certainly won more titles, as the rather depressing recent champions lists of the major leagues proves. This is why Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Juventus generally dominate with such ease. This is why it Atletico Madrid winning the Spanish league was so remarkable, and why it was that Leicester City winning the Premier League was a modern sporting miracle.\n\nAllied to this is the way the club game has so superseded the international game, since it is by definition so much more sophisticated and co-ordinated. It is now where the great tactical leaps take place, with by far the most influential this decade \u2013 and maybe ever \u2013 being Pep Guardiola\u2019s reinvention of the Dutch-Barcelona pressing-passing game in 2008.\n\nThat has in turn meant a leap in the very way the sport is played. It is so systemised now, with the top clubs executing highly co-ordinated attacking moves that were simply not imaginable at the turn of the millennium.\n\nIt is a far more sophisticated, and much less free-form sport.\n\nAll of this of course has significant meaning for a debate like this, and goes further than the lessening of international tournaments in historic importance.\n\nIn that regard, the performance over six or seven games in one summer just can\u2019t have the same emotional impact or resonance in a modern world where there is so much focus on huge Champions League games. Messi and Ronaldo\u2019s own displays in tournaments indicate this. Both have been better in them than often argued. But neither have had a Diego Maradona 1986 or a Roberto Baggio 1994.\n\nThe closest anyone on this list has actually come is Zidane 2000, Ronaldo 2002 and Fabio Cannavaro 2006.\n\nThe game has changed.\n\nBut, more relevantly \u2013 and entirely logically in a more systemised era \u2013 it is even harder to divorce individual agency from collective result.\n\nThis is why, in 2019, so many of the highest achieving players are those who submit to the system. It might well explain the struggles of others, like Neymar.\n\nIt also means, somewhat counter-intuitively, that brilliant players are that bit more replaceable. How many of the Bayern Munich players on this list, for example, would have had to be removed from their team to prevent them from winning the title in any given year?\n\nThe debate about David Silva perhaps sums this up, especially considering his place as a gloriously fluid cog in two of the greatest sides ever \u2013 the current Manchester City and Spain 2008-12. But a cog nevertheless.\n\nThe long and short is that there are fewer and fewer cases of individuals having immense influence in team efforts, in ways that did seem more prevalent at the beginning of the century. You only have to look at Roy Keane and Rivaldo.\n\nAnd yet it is still two individuals dominating the game, pointing to how far they are ahead of the rest.\n\nThe debate about them has dictated so much football discourse in this millennium, but it is the debate about those behind them that is perhaps more interesting, and unclear. It certainly led to a lot of debate in the Independent staff\u2019s own votes for this list, and some wild divergences in opinions in a way that was itself very different in the arguments for the greatest Premier League players.\n\nYou are likely to have the same reaction. It\u2019s a sign of how much the game has changed.\n\nWelcome to The Independent Century countdown.", "description": "The issue when attempting to separate the 100 greatest players of the new millennium is that it really comes down to separating distinct eras that are far more meaningful in football terms than those set by the Gregorian calendar.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/18/century-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
