It\u2019s hard to get a \u00addefinitive answer as to why.\n\nA pharmacist told me there\u2019s a shortage of the Chinese made \u00adadhesive used in HRT patches. Then my doctor muttered something \u00adcryptic about \u201cpharmaceutical \u00adcompanies game-playing\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Big Pharma control the market so tightly that a glitch in just one \u00adfactory can stop production around the globe.\n\nBut we still have absolutely no idea what additional impact Brexit will have.\n\nThis week the Government issued a ban on the export of HRT and 23 other drugs in a bid to protect supplies.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock insists the move is nothing to do with Brexit and we mustn\u2019t worry about even worse shortages in the event of a cliff-edge departure.\n\nBut I do worry \u2013 and so do the 100,000 other women who rely on the same type of HRT as me.\n\nI had to have a hysterectomy three years ago, before I\u2019d entered the menopause or started having symptoms.\n\nWithout replacement hormones I will plunge off a cliff too \u2013 into mood swings, hot flushes and potential mental health issues.\n\nAnd, having suffered from clinical \u00addepression in the past, I am terrified.\n\n(Image: Ian Forsyth)\n\nMy GP assures me that this won\u2019t happen \u2013 that we\u2019ll find an alternative drug\n\nBut as I\u2019ve traipsed round dozens of large and small pharmacies, I\u2019ve seen stressed staff dealing with other \u00adworried patients.\n\nMany told the Chemist and Druggist survey they were \u201cbarely coping\u201d and \u201con a knife edge\u201d.\n\nOne told me she\u2019s met women who are now buying their HRT abroad \u2013 from as far away as the US and South Africa.\n\nMatt Hancock says he \u00adunderstands how distressing medicine shortages can be but the \u00adgovernment \u201cwill always act to ensure that there is an adequate supply of the \u00admedicine you need.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll take your word for it Mr Hancock.\n\nNow can you please tell me where I can pick up 24 Evorel 50 patches to tide me over till Christmas?", "description": "A poll of more than 400 pharmacists reveals 84 per cent are struggling to obtain any HRT stocks while others are running out of \u00adcontraceptives, anti-depressants, blood pressure, diabetes and epilepsy \u00admedications", "authors": ["Rachael Bletchly", "Image", "Getty", "Ian Forsyth"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466007.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HRT-patch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
