A 75-foot boat enveloped by flames against a backdrop of a black predawn sky. Dozens of passengers trapped below, unable to flee the inferno.\n\nAnd the close-knit California dive community left searching for answers after the loss of so many lives.\n\n\u201cWhat happened has devastated us to the core. We are having a difficult time wrapping our heads around the details of how such a fire could have occurred,\u201d Elliot Gomez told Fox News. Gomez is longtime diving instructor who has worked with and dived with True Aquatics, the owner of the ill-fated boat, for over 15 years.\n\n\u201cWe look out for each other. To lose one diver in any situation is a terrible thing. To lose an entire boat is a loss we cannot fathom. The loss of life and conditions surrounding it has left me \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 in shambles.\u201d\n\nSanta Barbara County officials announced Tuesday that the search had been suspended; 34 people were presumed dead. The bodies of 20 people \u2013 nine males and 11 females \u2013 were recovered, and divers found at least four others in the hollowed wreckage. The identification process will require DNA testing, investigators said.\n\nA total of 39 people were aboard the Conception. It should have been a delightful summer swan song, diving among California\u2019s vivid sea gardens and leaving with treasured memories. But on the final day of the Labor Day weekend expedition, as the Conception waded into the coast of California\u2019s Santa Cruz, the vessel went up in flames.\n\n25 BODIES FOUND AFTER CALIFORNIA SCUBA DIVING BOAT FIRE, COAST GUARD SAYS\n\nThe Conception\u2019s captain, Jerry Boylan, made a mayday call to a Coast Guard dispatcher around 4 a.m. on Monday.\n\nVentura County firefighters were able to reach the burning vessel within 15 minutes but struggled to extinguish the scorching boat as it continued to erupt in flames. Truth Aquatics did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmong those believed to have died was Charter Master Kristy Finstad, a 41-year-old marine biologist and owner of Worldwide Diving Adventures, which had chartered the vessel.\n\nHer brother, Brett Harmeling, 31, told Fox News that relatives were preparing for confirmation of the grim news.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we just hope that it was painless when she crossed over to the other side,\u201d he said, recalling his sibling\u2019s deep love for diving \u2013 a hobby she took up at the tender age of 12. \u201cShe loved the earth and was passionate about marine biology. She was a fun and dynamic woman. She was always seeking adventure. She always created a sense of love in everything she did.\u201d\n\nHarmeling also offered some poignant life reflections through his grief.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always been a student of life. She never stopped living,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder to love the people close to you while they are here because you\u2019ll never know when they will be gone.\u201d\n\nFinstad\u2019s husband and business partner, Dan Chua, initially was supposed to be on the doomed expedition \u2013 but instead was leading a dive team near Costa Rica. He was slated to return Sept. 13. Friends tried to reach him frantically on Monday and Tuesday, fearing the worst for his wife and the dozens of victims.\n\nNeil Hogue, a fellow diver and friend of the couple, said he was still waiting with dread. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to hear who else was on board as I\u2019ve dived for many years with World Wide Adventures, started diving at 13 with Kristy and her father, Bill,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cKristy is the most knowledgeable person I have ever been around when it comes to the ocean and sea life. She gets so excited and intense talking about it. We have had the most fun dive trips you can imagine.\u201d\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Finstad\u2019s Facebook page was awash with pictures and memories of the devoted research diver and vivacious ocean lover.\n\n\u201cDear Kristy Finstad who will always be that sweet beautiful kid who I never got to spend enough time with,\u201d one family member reminisced.\n\n\u201cMay you be free of suffering, may you know peace,\u201d wrote another friend. \u201cYou are loved, dear Kristy Finstad. Spread your wings and fly...\u201d\n\nThe devastating sorrow has spread to the school community.\n\n\u201cPacific Collegiate School is saddened by the tragic sinking of the diving vessel. While this was not a school-sponsored trip, our hearts and thoughts are with the families of the victims and those yet missing, particularly those of our students and parents on board,\u201d the Santa Cruz school said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cRight now, our priority as a school community is to support our students, staff, and families in the wake of this tragedy.\u201d\n\nTwo students from the elite public charter school were on the boat.\n\n\u201cIt is with a broken heart \u2026 3 of our daughters were on this boat. As of now, they are still missing. My #1, Evanmichel Solano Quitasol, my #3, NicoleStorm Quitasol and my #4, Angela Rose Quitasol. My girls\u2019 dad Michel Storm Quitasol and stepmom were also on the boat,\u201d Susan Solano Rosas wrote in a Facebook statement Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe are getting the latest information from the media. The authorities do not have much to say to us. Thank you to all of you for your support prayers and good wishes.\u201d\n\nSt. Joseph\u2019s Medical Center in Stockton confirmed that it had learned that one of its nurses, Evan Quitasol, was on the boat. Evan\u2019s father, Michael Quitasol, and Fernisa Sison, two former staff members at the hospital, also were confirmed to be on board.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Barbara, Truth Aquatics has been serving the fishing and dive community since 1974. The Conception launched in 1981 as a fully equipped, 75-foot commercial diving boat that could spend multiple days at sea and hold a maximum of 46 people.\n\nFive surviving crew members were able to get off the boat and retrieve a dinghy before paddling to a 60-foot fisherman boat \u2013 the only other vessel anchored in the immediate vicinity \u2013 owned by Bob and Shirley Hansen. Two of the crew members, Hansen told The New York Times, tried to return to the engulfed wreck to find survivors \u2013 but found no signs of life.\n\nAccording to Daniel Bertucelli of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, one of the surviving crew members broke his leg while jumping from the boat and was treated at a local hospital. The others did not appear to have sustained physical injuries.\n\nA sixth crew member remained unaccounted for, presumed dead. Ralph Clevenger, a photographer who has been diving with True Aquatics for over 25 years and routinely has taken photographs for the company\u2019s three boats, explained that one crew member always would sleep down with the passengers. He was still waiting for that name to be revealed.\n\n\u201cThis is just such an unprecedented tragedy. It is hard to wrap your head around,\u201d Bertucelli continued. \u201cIt is really sad to know what a lot of families are going through now, preparing for the worst.\u201d\n\nOfficials intended to conduct \u201crapid DNA testing,\u201d which would require obtaining swabs from family members to speed up the process that traditionally would take around two weeks.\n\nThe recovered bodies sustained \u201csignificant thermal injuries,\u201d investigators told Fox News.\n\nBut, many of those within the grieving dive community were rallying behind True Aquatics and its safety record.\n\n\u201cEvery trip starts with a mandatory safety briefing and liability waiver. Exits, fire plans, emergency diving procedures, and eating procedures are discussed. There are multiple fire extinguishers on every level. However, the main entrance and egress to the berths are via the double-sided staircase to the showers and bunks at the bow next to the galley,\u201d said Sarina Elliot, who has taken multiple trips with the company since 2015 as a guest and a charter.\n\nElliot also sang the praises of \u201cCaptain Jerry\u201d Boylan, who \u201chas been in charge of the Conception since anyone can remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a happy, smiling sea captain with a quiet demeanor. He tries his best to give guests the best experience aboard possible but will level with folks when it comes to safety. He jokes that (accidents) require too much paperwork he would prefer to avoid, but we all know that he would not hesitate to risk his life for the good of his guests and crew,\u201d she said. \u201cTruth operates a quality charter, which meets or exceeds standards. I am confident that this was something completely out of human control.\u201d\n\nIt has since been determined that the Conception was in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with safety regulations.\n\nROB LOWE ON CALIFORNIA BOAT FIRE: 'AN UNSPEAKABLE HORROR ON A BOAT I\u2019VE BEEN ON MANY TIMES'\n\n\u201cTrue Aquatics is a real legacy in Southern California diving. It is just unheard of to have so many killed in a boating accident,\u201d Clevenger said. \u201cThe crew was always great people, and Captain Jerry was always very concerned with safety and getting us all home.\u201d\n\nThe bunk beds on the Conception appeared to have been made of wood and were divided into four rows with shelves at the end to hold small bags and personal belongings. Some who previously had stayed on the Conception explained that the staircase was near the front of the galley, so if there had been a blaze there, it would be difficult to move in or out.\n\n\u201cIt must have happened very fast,\u201d one former passenger surmised. \u201cMost of the crew sleeps up top in the wheelhouse and not below deck. They take turns with the captain and others to do what is needed throughout the night.\u201d\n\nGomez underscored that he has \u201cdived all over the world, and Truth Aquatics is one of the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a day of diving, divers are usually exhausted and sleeping hard. The generator noise and ventilation fans generate a fair amount of white noise so it would take a substantial amount of noise. The primary ingress-egress from the sleeping area in the hull is a set of stairs at the front leading into the galley in the center of the ship on the main deck. The stairs go right up and into the galley area with no overhead obstructions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is also a rarely used, second emergency egress ... at the back of the sleeping quarters which leads up into the rear of the galley\u2019s main island through a lid/hatch and door.\n\n\"Whatever happened must have been fast and overwhelming.\u201d\n\nRobert Chacon, a retired FBI agent and longtime leader of its dive team and underwater forensics program, said he'd dived with True Aquatics for around a decade and concurred that it had a good reputation and was highly regarded within the Southern California dive community.\n\n\u201cIf the fire started above, it would have been a worst-case scenario. The crew may have tried to fight it from above, we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut the crew usually sleeps in the least desirable part of the boat, and the higher you go, the least stable it is, which is why guest quarters were at the bottom and why the crew members were the ones able to escape.\u201d\n\nInvestigators had yet to establish a definitive cause of the catastrophic inferno. As it stood, there was no indication of criminal intent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA vigil outside Truth Aquatics in the Santa Barbara Harbor has continued to grow, as a community in mourning attempts to grasp the magnitude of the loss.\n\n\u201cI can say with confidence they (crew members on-board) are distraught,\u201d Gregory Alexander, a dive photographer and longtime True Aquatics devotee, said. \u201cThey tend to take responsibility for anything that happens on the boat, even things that are completely out of their control.\u201d\n\nFox News' Perry Chiaramonte and Cristina Corbin contributed to this report", "description": "t\u2019s the stuff of nightmares.
