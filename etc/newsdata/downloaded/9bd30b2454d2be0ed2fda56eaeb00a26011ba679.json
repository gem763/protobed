In the video, posted by Chengdu Economic Daily, the owner of the cafe said it was also offering a dyeing service for 1,500 yuan (\u00a3165) to patrons who wished to give their pets a similar makeover.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chow chow dogs painted as giant pandas in the Chengdu cafe.

Another said: \u201cI suggest dyeing the dog owners black and white.\u201d\n\nSome pointed to comments by vets that dyeing a dog can damage its skin. \u201cDogs are dogs. Dyeing them doesn\u2019t turn them into pandas, and they are living beings. You \u2026 hurt them just for the sake of what you think looks good.\u201d\n\nOthers, calling the animals \u201cpanda dogs\u201d, defended the cafe owner\u2019s right to change the pets\u2019 appearance. \u201cIt\u2019s your dog. You get to decide. Very cute,\u201d one said.\n\nFollowing the online response, the cafe said on its Weibo page that it would not continue to offer the dyeing service. \u201cChengdu is the home of pandas. We wanted to do something different, to differentiate us from other regular dog cafes and pet shops,\u201d the owner of the cafe, surnamed Huang, told local media.\n\nIn a statement posted on Weibo on Tuesday, the cafe said: \u201cAs their owners, their lives are much better than ours. They are also very healthy. Netizens please don\u2019t project your thoughts on to us.\u201d", "description": "\u2018I suggest dyeing cafe owner black and white,\u2019 says one critic over stunt in Chengdu", "authors": ["Lillian Yang", "Kevin Mckenna"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c2aed00bdb51f8261a48e1c9dfab64ca5c4b15/263_460_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c2e71b8f186ef9982f82d28b5d53887e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
