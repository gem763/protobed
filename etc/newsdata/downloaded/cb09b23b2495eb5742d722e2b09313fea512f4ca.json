He talks to John Banville about our \u2018dismal statesmanship\u2019 and what he learned from his time as a spy\n\nI have always admired John le Carr\u00e9. Not always without envy \u2013 so many bestsellers! \u2013 but in wonderment at the fact that the work of an artist of such high literary accomplishment should have achieved such wide appeal among readers. That le Carr\u00e9, otherwise David Cornwell, has chosen to set his novels almost exclusively in the world of espionage has allowed certain critics to dismiss him as essentially unserious, a mere entertainer. But with at least two of his books, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1963) and A Perfect Spy (1986), he has written masterpieces that will endure.\n\nWhich other writer could have produced novels of such consistent quality over a career spanning almost 60 years, since Call for the Dead in 1961, to his latest, Agent Running in the Field, which he is about to publish at the age of 87. And while he has hinted that this is to be his final book, I am prepared to bet that he is not done yet. He is just as intellectually vigorous and as politically aware as he has been at any time throughout his long life.\n\nIn the new book there is a plotline that is predicated on covert collusion between Trump\u2019s US and the British security services with the aim of undermining the democratic institutions of the European Union. \u201cIt\u2019s horribly plausible,\u201d he says, with some relish when we meet in his Hampstead home. His relish is for the fictional conceit, not its horrible plausibility, and at once his conman father pops up with his large-browed head and his all too plausible grin. Ronald \u201cRonnie\u201d Cornwell was a confidence trickster of genius, of whom his son is still in awe, and to whose exploits and influence he returns again and again, to the point of bemused obsession. \u201cI\u2019ve had the good fortune in life,\u201d says le Carr\u00e9, \u201cto be born with a subject\u201d \u2013 no, not the cold war, which many foolishly imagined was his only topic \u2013 \u201cthe extraordinary, the insatiable criminality of my father and the people he had around him. I Googled him the other day and under \u2018profession\u2019 it said: \u2018Associate of the Kray brothers\u2019.\u201d This gives us both a laugh, though a queasy one.\n\n\u201cA ceaseless procession of fascinating people\u201d wound its felonious way through his childhood. In his earliest days he was \u201crelieved of any real concept of truth. Truth was what you got away with.\u201d All too familiar to him, then, are the frauds who have swaggered their way into the spotlight in today\u2019s political pantomime.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A confidence trickster of genius\u2019 \u2026 le Carr\u00e9\u2019s father, Ronald Cornwell. Photograph: Courtesy of John Le Carre\n\nIt seems to le Carr\u00e9 now entirely natural that escape from the toxic background of his childhood should have been entry into \u201csevere institutions\u201d. He was sent to his first boarding school at the age of five \u2013 \u201cand I did five years straight of stir\u201d. He went on to Sherborne school in Dorset, which he hated \u2013 in later years the head of the Secret Intelligence Service, David Spedding, told him that what he most admired him for was the fact that \u201cyou ran away from Sherborne while I stayed the course\u201d. Spedding\u2019s rueful warmth is in marked contrast to the recent attack on le Carr\u00e9 by another former head of MI6, Richard Dearlove, who last month at a literary festival in Cliveden \u2013 of all places \u2013 said the writer was \u201cobsessed\u201d with his brief time as a spy, which he had used as a basis for novels that reveal him to be \u201cso corrosive in his view of MI6 that most SIS officers are pretty angry with him\u201d.\n\nFor all his sufferings under the educational system of the day, boarding school was for le Carr\u00e9 \u201cone route in the search for some sort of clarity about behaviour\u201d. Then came \u201cthe glide into the secret world\u201d: at Oxford he was approached by the security services and did some spying, and informing, on his fellow students of the left-leaning sort, something of which he does not repent. John le Carr\u00e9, or better say David Cornwell, is at heart an old-fashioned, romantic English patriot. For all that, he is not deluded about the mores of the \u201csecret world\u201d. The security services fixed on their candidates \u201cfor being on the one hand larcenous\u201d \u2013 a favourite word \u2013 \u201cand on the other hand, however you call it, loyal\u201d. This dichotomy raised \u201chuge, many-faceted questions\u201d, for instance what distinguishes patriotism, good, from nationalism, bad. That particular question \u201ckicked around in me ever after. It remains unresolved.\u201d\n\nI mention a passage in Agent Running in the Field in which the protagonist Nat, short for Anatoly, a middle-aged, Russo-English secret agent, is watching on screen a surveillance operation being carried out in the streets of London, and is suddenly, and surprisingly, seized with admiration for his country and its people: \u201cmulti-ethnic kids playing improvised netball, girls in summer dresses basking in rays of the endless sun, old folk sauntering arm-in-arm ... \u201d The irony, as Nat cannot but be aware, is that about 100 of these innocent-seeming folk, including the friendly police officer who \u201cstrolls comfortably among them\u201d, are in fact British agents busy about their clandestine work. Freedom is fragile, and must be protected by all available means, even the tainted ones.\n\nLe Carr\u00e9 speaks of his grandchildren who are \u201call appalled by Brexit and the concept that freedom of movement is being taken from them, and so on. I say: \u2018Look, actually, you have lived in many foreign cities, and you know that you will never get better conversation, a greater sophistication, more ease of social contact, than in London or in Britain altogether.\u2019\u201d\n\nMob orators of Boris Johnson's sort do not speak reason \u2013 your task is to fire up the people with nos\u00adtalgia, with anger\n\nI tell him that I lived in London for a year at the end of the 1960s and, coming from an Ireland that in those days was still firmly locked in the stranglehold of the Catholic church, I was endlessly surprised by the freedom of movement that was allowed to me, especially up and down the rungs of the infinitely graduated English class system. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he says, with a melancholy smile, \u201cbut you were not branded on the tongue.\u201d\n\nIn Cornwall, where he and his wife, Jane, live for a good part of the year, \u201cdealing with traders, and going to cafes and so on, I find that nobody knows, or cares, who I am\u201d. This is, he feels, an example of \u201cthe absolute ease of association\u201d there is in at least that part of England, where there is \u201ca real sense of democracy\u201d.\n\nI agree with him, though perhaps not wholeheartedly \u2013 I am Irish, after all \u2013 on the British commitment to liberal values and the civilised life. But surely all that is now at risk, with the country so divided on Europe?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Damian Lewis in the 2016 film adaptation of Our Kind of Traitor. Photograph: Allstar/Studiocanal\n\n\u201cYes it is, because in the first place reason has no natural voice. Mob orators of the sort we have, the Boris Johnson sort, do not speak reason. When you get into that category, your task is to fire up the people with nostalgia, with anger. It\u2019s almost unbelievable that these people of the establishment \u2013 Farage, for instance \u2013 are speaking of betrayal: \u2018I\u2019m betrayed by parliament, betrayed by government \u2013 I\u2019m speaking to you as a betrayed person, and I\u2019m a man of the people like you.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe is profoundly worried by the present state of his country. Johnson and his svengali, Dominic Cummings, are running what le Carr\u00e9 recognises as a highly sophisticated propaganda campaign to convince the people that they are their true champions, arrayed with them against the power of parliament and the political elite. This, he says, is a breathtaking sleight of hand that could bring about serious civil disorder. \u201cAnd absolutely the most terrifying thing that could happen is that the EU should cave in on some minor point regarding the backstop, Johnson blows the dust off May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, adds his own spin, claims a great victory, gets it through a frightened parliament, and rules for eight years.\u201d\n\nYet all is not bleakness and cause for ire. \u201cI think everything is controllable if the social contract is restored. You cannot preach a level playing field in this country as long as you have such exclusive institutions as private education, private medicine, private everything.\u201d There is also the pervasive and pernicious influence of what have come to be called social media \u2013 though how far they are truly \u201csocial\u201d is moot. \u201cPeople are shown so many treats, and urged as to what to buy and what to wear and where to travel to, all of which pumps up a spurious notion of the perfect life.\u201d\n\nHow to combat these dangerous fantasies? \u201cI believe we have to do the things that other countries do pretty painlessly. We have to have a wealth tax, we have to limit hugely the amount of inherited wealth anyone can receive. And none of these things has happened.\u201d\n\nBut who would make them happen?\n\n\u201cWell, we have an extraordinary situation with our Labour party, if they do get in and they can shed Corbyn \u2013 I think Corbyn would quite like to go, actually \u2013 but they have this Leninist element and they have this huge appetite to level society. I\u2019ve always believed, though ironically it\u2019s not the way I\u2019ve voted, that it\u2019s compassionate conservatism that in the end could, for example, integrate the private schooling system. If you do it from the left you will seem to be acting out of resentment; do it from the right and it looks like good social organisation.\u201d\n\nI tentatively suggest that by this stage we might sound like two crusty old codgers being sentimental about an imaginary golden age. He ponders this for a while, then sets off on a tangential tack. \u201cYou could say that with the demise of the working class we saw also the demise of an established social order, based on the stability of ancient class structures. And then, the working class had the experience of war, but one can count the years when one by one people with war experience disappeared from politics and were replaced, in the main, by people with no idea of human conflict.\u201d And he adds, with straight-faced understatement: \u201cHuman conflict has a sobering effect.\u201d\n\nTo hear Brexiters claiming that Britain won the war single-handedly is, he says, \u201cemetic\u201d. \u201cThe wonderful rightwing military historian Max Hastings points out that we were bad fighters, that we were extremely badly organised, and our contribution in terms of blood and wealth and material was \u2013 I can\u2019t say trivial, but tremendously small by comparison to the sacrifices of the other major powers. Russia lost, what, 30 million men? And in treasure, heaven knows what. We didn\u2019t win the war in that sense. We were on the winning side by the end, but we were really quite minor players.\u201d\n\nHis attitude to Brexit is pungently expressed in the new novel. \u201cIt is my considered opinion,\u201d one of the characters declares to Nat, \u201cthat for Britain and Europe, and for liberal democracy across the entire world as a whole, Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union in the time of Donald Trump, and Britain\u2019s consequent unqualified dependence on the United States in an era when the US is heading straight down the road to institutional racism and neo-fascism, is an unmitigated clusterfuck bar none.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t say plainer than that, even if you have made yourself safe by putting the speech into the mouth of one of your invented creatures. Le Carr\u00e9 says squarely of Agent Running in the Field that \u201cto me it\u2019s quite an angry book\u201d. But certainly it is more, and happily less, than a political rant.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Seen on screen \u2026 Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes in the 2005 film adaptation of The Constant Gardener. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be a Brexit novel. I wanted it to be readable and comic. I wanted people to get a good laugh out of it. But if one has the impertinence to propose a message, then the book\u2019s message is that our concept of patriotism and nationalism \u2013 our concept of where to place our loyalties, collectively and individually \u2013 is now utterly mysterious. I think Brexit is totally irrational, that it\u2019s evidence of dismal statesmanship on our part, and lousy diplomatic performances. Things that were wrong with Europe could be changed from inside Europe.\u201d He pauses, then goes on, less in anger than in sadness. \u201cI think my own ties to England were hugely loosened over the last few years. And it\u2019s a kind of liberation, if a sad kind.\u201d\n\nIt was in this spirit that he and wife, Jane, paid a visit recently to Ireland, Jane to delve again among her own roots in Ulster, and David to visit the house in West Cork where his paternal grandmother was raised. He consulted a local archivist for information on the family. \u201cAfter spending silent minutes at her computer, she looked up with a charming smile and said: \u2018Welcome home.\u2019\u201d\n\nI suggest that Agent Running in the Field is affirmative of the small pleasures of life, which makes the book very enjoyable. Well, he is careful to remind me again, the voice that speaks in it is not that of John le Carr\u00e9, and certainly not of David Cornwell, but of Nat, the narrator. \u201cWhen you\u2019re challenged about the behaviour of characters in your own novels,\u201d he asks me, \u201cdo you feel obliged to defend their behaviour?\u201d My answer is that I am no more responsible for them than I am responsible for the people in my dreams. This gets a nod of assent.\n\nBesides Nat, the two other leading characters in the book, the gangly Ed and the beautiful Florence \u2013 I notice that the women in le Carr\u00e9\u2019s books become lovelier, and younger, the older the author gets \u2013 are essentially decent people. As such, surely they are something of an anomaly? In his reply he seems to agree. \u201cIf you\u2019re putting together a secret service you\u2019re looking for people who can charm, who can persuade, and who are not burdened with too much moral sense. People are naturally larcenous and sufficiently hypocritical to appear virtuous and loyal, so actually you are looking for people who are almost by definition capable of betraying you.\u201d Hence by the end of the book the decent people in it have to be put away in a place of safety.\n\nMy dad for part of my childhood was in prison. So I arrived in the heartland of the establish\u00adment as a kind of spy\n\nWhat of his own origins as a secret agent? \u201cFrom the moment I went to boarding schools I was learning to be a gent\u201d \u2013 nice little pun \u2013 \u201cI had none of the attitudes of the ruling class to keep me going. I didn\u2019t have a pony, that kind of thing. My dad for part of my childhood was in prison. So I arrived in the heartland of the establishment \u2013 private education \u2013 as a kind of spy, as somebody who had to put on the uniform, affect a voice and attitudes, and give myself a background I didn\u2019t have. And so it was a forced assimilation and I became fascinated by the class I was pretending to be a member of. And it\u2019s no surprise to me that although I loathed my public school I ended up teaching at Eton, and it\u2019s no surprise to me now that I was so fascinated by the interior motor of British society, and that I was drawn to what I believe is the secret centre of our administration.\u201d\n\nDid being a spy give him a sense of belonging, of finally finding a workable identity for himself? \u201cLooking really \u2013 in some Faustian sense, God help me \u2013 for what the world holds at its innermost point, was a way of asking, what are we? Who were we? Which is probably an extension of the question, who the hell am I? Where is virtue to be found? Where is the altar of Englishness? And I think that really was quite a severe internal journey, and a very interesting one, in retrospect: a lost boy in search of something or other.\u201d\n\nBut when he was a member of the security services did he feel he was in touch with the real world, as distinct from the fantasised one in which the majority of us blithely live? \u201cPlease remember, I was a very junior figure in both MI5 and MI6. So much of what in my novels is assumed to be interior knowledge is really imagined stuff. But when I was allowed to attend operational meetings I heard what bigger animals than I were getting up to, and so by the time I got out of that world \u2013 with great relief \u2013 I had a really big treasure chest of imagined operations, which were based on glimpses of the reality. But I never did anything of the least value in that world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Le Carr\u00e9 on Hampstead Heath with his son Nicholas in 1979. Photograph: Monty Fresco/Daily Mail/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe aftermath of the secret life contained moments of rich comedy. Yevgeny Primakov \u2013 former head of the KGB, \u201cwho was within a hair\u2019s breadth of getting Putin\u2019s job\u201d \u2013 came to Britain for an official visit, at the end of which his one request was to meet le Carr\u00e9.\n\n\u201cAnd so Jane and I found ourselves in the Russian embassy surrounded by Russians, with Primakov in front of me. He was an extremely intelligent man, quite a humanist, though at the age of 18 he was already working with the NKVD, later to become the KGB. He was charming and we had a wonderful time together, but I was so in above my pay rate that it was ridiculous. He imagined somehow that the author of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold was a colleague in sophistication. And that sometimes happens to me still. People insist that I know things that I have absolutely no knowledge of, and never did have.\u201d\n\nWe speak about his later books, set among the super-rich, in nasty foreign wars, in battles with the international pharmaceutical industry. It is apparent that he is proud of this work, and of his support for the forces of decency, such as they are. This brings us back, inevitably, to the enigma that is his father. \u201cI puzzle hugely about his motivation. You ask me what was fun for him. I think what was fun for him were the great confidence tricks he pulled off.\u201d\n\nDid this not make Ronnie an artist, of a kind?\n\n\u201cThis is the thing that fascinates me, of course: am I simply the lucky version of him?\u201d\n\nIf so, it is we, John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s readers, who are the lucky ones\n\n\u2022 John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s Agent Running in the Field is published by Viking (\u00a320).
