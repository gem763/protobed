I'm not going to change my position,\u201d Sanders said when asked about criticism she has faced in public places from the president\u2019s detractors.\n\n\u201cIt would be very odd to go from doing what I was doing, to all of a sudden doing something different,\u201d she added. \u201cI loved my experience. I loved working for the president. I think he has been able to do some tremendous things for the country, and I look forward to watching him do it for six more years.\u201d\n\nTrump weighed in with ringing praise after the segment, tweeting : \u201cGreat interview of Sarah Sanders by @foxandfriends. She is a terrific person with a great future!\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 vociferous endorsement of the president\u2019s leadership from outside the White House contrasts markedly with other former administration officials\u2019 assessments of Trump after departing government service.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, a former White House communications director who promoted Sanders into her previous post, has blanketed cable news airwaves in recent weeks to level harsh blows against the president, accusing him of employing \u201cracist rhetoric\u201d and having \u201cgone off the rails.\u201d\n\nEven former Defense Secretary James Mattis, the retired Marine general who has said he feels duty-bound to keep quiet his opinions about the president, has hinted at disagreements with Trump\u2019s foreign policy outlook and provocative social media pronouncements during recent interviews for his book tour.\n\nAt Fox News, Sanders is poised to champion Trump and his agenda perhaps more vocally than even Stephanie Grisham, her successor as press secretary, who has shied away from media appearances and shown reluctance to embrace the part of the White House\u2019s attack dog to the extent Sanders did in the position.\n\nGrisham, who served previously as a top aide to first lady Melania Trump, has yet to hold a press briefing and has participated in only a small handful of TV interviews.\n\nBut Sanders' political ambitions could stretch well beyond Washington and benefit from Trump\u2019s backing. Three people who have spoken to Sanders told POLITICO in June that she is seriously considering a run for Arkansas governor in 2022, and multiple people close to Sanders spoke of a poll commissioned by her allies that showed her beating potential rival candidates in the gubernatorial race.\n\nSanders also launched a sleek new personal website last month and announced Thursday she will author a memoir about her time in the White House slated for publication in the fall of 2020.\n\nUnlike explosive accounts by former administration officials including Omarosa Manigault Newman and Cliff Sims , Sanders previewed Friday that her book will recall fondly her time serving under Trump before her resignation as press secretary in June.\n\n\"My experience was extremely positive. My book will be positive,\u201d she said.", "description": "The president's former spokeswoman signaled she will continue to serve as a vocal and loyal defender of her old boss.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c4/c7/5514d54f43b9ab29303469c4b6f8/190906-sarah-sanders-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
