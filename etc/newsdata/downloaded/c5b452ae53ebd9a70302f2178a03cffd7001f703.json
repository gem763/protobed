He shared his plans at a whip meeting yesterday. Other House Democratic aides said they expected the bill to be on the floor during the week of Sept. 23.\n\nThe bipartisan legislation would shield banks from federal penalties if they serve cannabis-related businesses in states where the drug has been legalized. Banks have been lobbying for the bill because cannabis remains banned at the federal level.\n\nThe new movement in the House comes as the legislation appears to be getting unexpected traction in the Senate, where Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) is planning to hold a vote on a cannabis banking bill this year.\n\nNatalie Fertig contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Banks have been lobbying for the bill because cannabis remains banned at the federal level.", "authors": ["Zachary Warmbrodt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
