That question was: how many Leicester City players would get into the Manchester United side?\n\nBen Chilwell, probably. James Maddison, almost certainty. In fact, you could make a case for more than a few. Football is rarely that simple, though. United have struggled against sides who sit deep and let them have the ball. That was always unlikely to be Leicester\u2019s game plan.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Instead, they admirably attempted to play their own game and can say they came close to taking a result back to the east Midlands. But still, they may leave Manchester with the sense they played into their opponents hands.\n\nUnited making opponents pay the penalty\n\nMarcus Rashford\u2019s penalty was United\u2019s fourth of the Premier League season already. It meant they had won 40% of all the penalties awarded in the top flight this season. No other club has more than one. And without wanting to invite crankery and conspiracy theories, the temptation is to ask why.\n\nFor all their faults, United have developed a knack for penetrating the penalty area and drawing fouls. Think Paul Pogba against Wolves, Scott McTominay against Crystal Palace and Rashford here, tempting Caglar Soyuncu into making contact without giving him much opportunity to win the ball. It is a useful skill for Solskjaer\u2019s United to have in their locker, especially as they otherwise suffer from a general lack of creativity.\n\nMaguire unfazed by Foxes reunion\n\nThe travelling Leicester supporters made some alterations to their old Harry Maguire chant before kick-off, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you, we\u2019ve got Soyuncu\u201d. It was not heard too often after their new hero conceded the early penalty. Maguire, meanwhile, calmly went about the business of facing his former club.\n\nEven though Leicester asked plenty of questions of United\u2019s defence, Maguire usually had an answer and one piece of defensive play produced the loudest cheer since Rashford\u2019s opening goal. Demarai Gray believed he could beat his old team-mate to the ball. He was wong, then he was turned by a nimble Maguire, whose show of composure had the home fans in raptures.\n\nAll-action McTominay proves his worth\n\nOne of the quiet successes of United\u2019s indifferent start to the season has been McTominay. Though hardly the most inspiring of names to see on a team sheet, the young midfielder has subtly impressed when tasked with breaking up play in the middle of the park and put in an authoritative display here.\n\nA forceful challenge on Ben Chilwell was particularly popular with the Old Trafford crowd. It was his start to the season in microcosm. McTominay has been a reliable presence, even a driving force at times, and a foil for the more creative players around him. United could use a few more players with the same level of consistency.\n\nFred re-emerges from the shadows\n\nCall off the search, he is still here. Fred was named among the substitutes by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and brought off the bench midway through the second half for his first appearance of the season. Having missed the summer tour due to getting married, there were some who wondered whether he would wait even longer to return.\n\nIt is a big sophomore season for the \u00a352m signing. Fred showed glimpses of what he can bring last year, but they were brief at best. Opportunities should come over the next few weeks, as United start their EFL Cup and Europa League campaigns, and the Brazilian will need to take them if he is not to prove a costly failure.", "description": "Leicester\u00a0leave with regrets after narrow defeat One question dominated the build-up to this meeting between one team who may be concerned about their top-six status and another hoping to replace them in the Premier League\u2019s elite.
