Just ask Ukraine\u2019s Oleksiy Honcharuk.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who was confirmed as the head of the Ukrainian government in late August, had a really busy Sunday evening last week. He attended an event at one of Kiev\u2019s bars to honor the nation\u2019s veterans and promise support to the armed forces. All good so far, except the event was a neo-Nazi gig featuring one of their favorite bands as the main attraction.\n\nImages of Honcharuk attending the \u201cVeterans Strong Party\u201d show him speaking from the stage with the banners of the band \u201cSokyra Peruna\u201d behind his back. One of the first people to share the pictures was Evgen Karas, the leader of the far-right organization C14, which is best known in the West for a series of attacks on Roma camps last year.\n\nC14, however, is not some lowly gang of skinheads but a notable political force. Karas, for example, had enough clout to be included in the entourage of former president Petro Poroshenko in January. And his organization has fingers in all sorts of pies in Ukraine. Their various branches and allied organizations serve as municipal guards in Kiev, are involved in teaching young people about healthy lifestyles, and represent military veterans \u2013 hence the patriotic event on Sunday.\n\nWhile C14 doesn\u2019t like to be called neo-Nazi and even took a TV station to court for describing them as such, the connection is hard to miss. Look no further than \u201cSokyra Peruna,\u201d the heavy metal band that played that evening. Outwardly, they are just focused on patriotism, Ukrainian nationalism and militarism with an occasional Nazi reference or two occasionally slipping through. However, the names of their songs like \u201cHeroes of My Race\u201d and \u201cGlory to Skinheads of the Great Rus\u201d somewhat give them away.\n\nAlso on rt.com Ukraine's Nazis: Who are they, why are they so influential \u2014 and why have media ignored them?\n\nTheir fans, however, are far less subtle. Photos from a concert of \u201cSokyra Peruna\u201d held in April 2018 caused a minor scandal because there were people literally displaying Nazi swastikas on their T-shirts and flags. They were even probed by the police about the gig, but nothing came of it.\n\nAdding insult to injury was who Karas credited for organizing the evening. It was none other than C14 member Andriy Medvedko, one of two far-right activists charged with assassinating prominent writer Oles Buzina in April 2015. He and his alleged accomplice were caught a couple of months after the vocal critic of post-coup authorities in Kiev was gunned down near his home. One might think a man facing up to 15 years for a premeditated murder might be a flight risk and belongs in jail, but apparently Medvedko\u2019s place is at a bar with the country\u2019s Prime Minister.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Honcharuk\u2019s appearance was because his office was oblivious about the nature of the event that he attended, or because he sympathizes with C14\u2019s cause. Either way, he has some explaining to do.\n\nLike this story?
