Nathan said Monday in an opinion and order in director Christian Charles\u2019 copyright infringement action against the motoring funnyman. \u201cThe Court agrees,\u201d the federal judge added, ending the dispute for good (read the order here).\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nCopyright civil cases have a three-year window within the statute for a suit to be brought forth with any chance of success once the official clock of notification or an issue of disagreement begins ticking.\n\nAlthough he communicated with Seinfeld in 2017 around the time the series inked a deal with Netflix and moved to the streamer from Crackle, Charles did not first take the Comedians in Cars matter to court until early 2018 \u2013 about three years too late it seems.\n\n\u201cBecause Charles was on notice that his ownership claim had been repudiated since at least 2012, his infringement claim is time-barred,\u201d Nathan further explained in her nine-page ruling dismissing the matter from the longtime Seinfeld collaborator of sorts. \u201cHis joint authorship claim is also time-barred for the same reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd his request for an injunction fails, because it was premised on Charles\u2019 assertion that he is the sole owner. Because Charles has had multiple opportunities to amend his complaint in the face of Defendants\u2019 timeliness arguments and has not made any further amendment requests, these claims are dismissed with prejudice.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s victory is a complete vindication,\u201d Seinfeld attorney Orin Snyder of Gibson Dunn Crutcher asserted in a statement following today\u2019s order. \u201cJerry created Comedians in Cars and this lawsuit was nothing but a money-grab seeking to capitalize on the success of the show. We are pleased that the Court saw through the noise and dismissed the case.\u201d\n\nAs well as helming the pilot for Comedians in Cars, Charles directed a number of those AMEX commercials featuring Seinfeld in the 1990s as well as the comic\u2019s 2002 road movie documentary Comedian. Having debuted its 11th season, its second on Netflix, on July 19, Comedians in Cars has hauled in a number of PGA Awards and been nominated four times for Primetime Emmy Awards, including this year.\n\nToday\u2019s legal victory comes less than two weeks after Netflix paid out a reported $500 million for global streaming rights to Seinfeld starting in 2021. Currently on Hulu, episodes of the iconic sitcom that ran from 1989-1998 on NBC will also be on Viacom-owned cable stations in syndication as of October 2021.\n\nYada, yada, yada.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
