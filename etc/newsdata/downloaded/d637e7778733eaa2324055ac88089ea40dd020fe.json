The deal values OpenSlate at more than $100 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nOpenSlate\u2019s platform provides analytics on the nature and quality of video programming on YouTube and Facebook. This includes an assessment of content subject matter as well as a custom rating advertisers can use to determine whether a particular video or channel is suitable for their ads.\n\nAs advertisers seek to reach customers who are increasingly spending time on social media platforms, many are striving to make sure their ads don\u2019t appear next to what they call \u201cunsafe\u201d content.\n\nIn February, for example, marketers such as Nestl\u00e9 SA, McDonald\u2019s Corp. and \u201cFortnite\u2019 maker Epic Games Inc. suspended advertising on YouTube after a report highlighted inappropriate user comments appearing under videos featuring underage girls.\n\nMajor marketers, social-media giants and ad agencies in June formed a coalition to develop steps to protect both people and brands from hate speech, bullying and misinformation online.\n\nOpenSlate has measured and scored more than 600 million ad-supported videos, the company said. Its clients include major media buying agencies such as Omnicom Group Inc. and WPP PLC\u2019s GroupM, as well as marketers such as Procter & Gamble Co. and Unilever PLC.\n\nAs part of the arrangement, Nielsen will offer customers of its Digital Ad Ratings product OpenSlate data as an add-on purchase. They aim eventually to bake OpenSlate data into the Nielsen product, they added.\n\nThis is the first time Nielsen will be offering brand safety data with its Digital Ad Ratings.\n\n\u201cNielsen\u2019s job is to make sure advertisers know they got what they paid for, that the ad was actually seen by the right people the right amount of times and that it was in a safe environment,\u201d said Megan Clarken, the chief commercial officer for Nielsen\u2019s global media business.\n\nOpenSlate will use the investment to make new hires, with a goal of doubling its head count by the end of 2020, as well as expanding more internationally, said Mike Henry, chief executive at OpenSlate. The company employs about 80 people.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to have OpenSlate data attached to all online video,\u201d Mr. Henry said.\n\nNielsen\u2019s deal with OpenSlate comes as the company strives to be a full-service independent measurement body for digital advertising. Nielsen last year updated its Digital Ad Ratings, which provides metrics on ads\u2019 online audiences, to include data on viewability, or how much of an ad appeared on-screen and for how long.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at Sahil.Patel@wsj.com", "description": "Executives declined to disclose the size of Nielsen\u2019s investment in OpenSlate.
