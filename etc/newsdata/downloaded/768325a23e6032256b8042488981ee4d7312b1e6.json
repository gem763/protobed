Fire crews spent the night battling the flames but were unable to save at least one family home. Image: News Corp Australia\n\nA Queensland valley was turned into a \u201cburning cauldron\u201d by bushfires that have destroyed a house.\n\nBut Lockyer Valley Mayor Tanya Milligan says the town of Laidley, 80 kilometres west of Brisbane, is counting its blessings despite fire having torn through about 10,000 hectares.\n\nJust one home was lost to the bushfires whipped up by dry winds.\n\nCr Milligan, who is yet to find out how bad the fire damage is at her own home, says she\u2019s thankful the region wasn\u2019t hit as hard as locations south of the Queensland border where up to 30 homes were lost.\n\n\u201cIt was either a bit of luck or extremely wonderful management \u2014 probably a bit of both,\u201d Cr Milligan told AAP.\n\nShe was able to view the blackened earth from a Queensland Fire and Emergency Service helicopter on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cIt gives you a difference perspective, up in the air, the drought side of it, and the dry dams \u2026 the reality of that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe guys in the helicopter were referring to the area as a burning cauldron yesterday, because of the topography. I came off that chopper shaking my head.\u201d\n\nAbout 30 fires continue to burn across Queensland on Wednesday as emergency crews hope rains forecast for Friday and Saturday will offer a brief reprieve to the unprecedented start to bushfire season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no substantial rain on the horizon for us, it\u2019s just drier and hotter, the rains would be a window of opportunity for people to stop and catch their breath,\u201d Cr Milligan said.\n\nPremier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned people to make sure they are prepared for bushfires.\n\n\u201cThe fire season will continue for many months,\u201d Ms Palaszczuk said.\n\n\u201cPolice are still doing their investigations but there is concern about one of the fires at this stage being deliberately lit,\u201d said Ms Palaszczuk.\n\nShe did not say which one.\n\nThe Laidley inferno flared up with little warning on Tuesday, catching firefighters by surprise as they were busy attending a fire at nearby Thornton. The Laidley fire burned right up to the fence line in one subdivision and the fierce flames melted a boat and ute in a yard.\n\nAt the peak of the fire danger on Tuesday some 120 evacuees were registered at the Laidley evacuation centre.\n\nFire warnings have been issued for blazes west of Beaudesert and north of Ipswich on Wednesday afternoon.", "description": "A Queensland valley was turned into a \u201cburning cauldron\u201d by bushfires that have destroyed a house.", "authors": ["Christine Flatley", "Nicholas Mcelroy"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/589cb2c161bd272b77dcfd8d7f80e5d1?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
