New sovereigns are entering the market and pioneers like France, Poland and Nigeria are now repeat green issuers,\u201d said Sean Kidney, chief executive of CBI.\n\n\u201cBond size and diversity of issuers is increasing, and noteworthy is the presence of leading European and Chinese banks amongst the largest issuers. All positive signs of market maturation,\u201d he said.\n\nKidney added, however, that even $400 billion a year of green bond issuance is not enough to provide the $1 trillion a year of green investment which is thought to be necessary to enable the transition to a low-carbon economy.", "description": "Global green bond and loan issuance has surpassed $200 billion so far this year, putting the market on track to reach $230 billion to $250 billion by the end of the year, the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Nina Chestney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
