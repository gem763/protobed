And today, just in time for cooler weather, this already-affordable Dutch oven is even less expensive: just $55 on Amazon, 45 percent off the list price. The oval shape means this cookware is ideal for roasting whole chickens, but you could make any stew or braise any meat you\u2019d like and feel confident that the result is just as good as anything you\u2019d make in a Dutch oven that\u2019s six times the price. We\u2019re partial to this autumnal orange, but it\u2019s also available in mint green, for those who prefer pastels.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
