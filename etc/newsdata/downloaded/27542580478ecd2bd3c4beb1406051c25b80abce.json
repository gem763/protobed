Charles Schwab\n\nCynthia Loh is playing a central role in setting the digital agenda inside of Charles Schwab.\n\n\"Defining the client experience\" for Schwab's robo-advisory and hybrid (a combination of both adviser and automation instructing your investing) offerings and planning services is written into Loh's job description.\n\nSchwab has made inroads this year to compete in an ever-crowded pool of digital wealth management and trading tools, notably the firm's shift to a subscription model for its robo-adviser's premium hybrid service and its move to eliminate online trading commissions for self-directed accounts.\n\nThe automated investing platforms under Loh have some $42 billion in total assets across 330,000 digital advice accounts, a pool that's nearly doubled in two years under her watch.\n\nInitially, introducing the new subscription pricing model earlier this year after about one year of fine-tuning was a \"somewhat scary move,\" Loh told Business Insider, considering the impact that new fee structures may have on revenue. Robos more typically charge a percentage of assets versus a fixed fee.\n\nLoh joined Charles Schwab in 2017 after spending two years at Betterment, where she built up the robo-adviser's 401 (k) business offering. Prior to that, she worked at the start-up ZocDoc.\n\nTaking the leap from two younger digital firms to Schwab, a legacy player, came with an uncertain feeling over whether she was joining an institution that could embrace change.\n\n\"I had a lot of apprehension, in some ways,\" Loh said, adding that at the time she thought, \"'Schwab is saying that they're very innovative. Are they, truly?' Two years in, I can say the answer is absolutely yes.\"\n\nWhen we asked Loh what excited her most in the future of digital wealth management and investing, she said what piqued her interest was \"a little more subtle.\" She thought of her own personal relationship with Amazon, which caters product recommendations for her.\n\n\"The type of personalization across product recommendations and preferences, or action items that I need to take \u2014 that type of thing is so great,\" she said. \"I'm excited for financial services to move in that direction as well.\"", "description": "For our inaugural list of wealth management innovators, we've pinpointed insiders shaking up fees, recruitment, and industry education.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ungarino"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db08d09cc4a0a38870211a8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
