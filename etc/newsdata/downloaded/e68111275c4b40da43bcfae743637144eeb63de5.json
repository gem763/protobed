People who have pets would understand this. Sometimes all you want to do is spend the entire day with someone who is not human, and who better than dogs or cats or...monkeys?\n\nAnimals can get as attached to humans as the latter to them, may be even more. This monkey is an example.\n\nA video was posted on Twitter, by a handle @esskayem08, and it is probably one of the most adorable things you will see today. In the video, one can see a monkey holding on to a child, calmly sitting in the middle of a road, somewhere in India, chilling and hugging.\n\nA woman (could be the child\u2019s mother) tries to come between the two, and take the child away from the monkey, but the latter can be seen literally slapping her hand as if conveying, \u2018not right now woman\u2019. After that the monkey holds on to the child more firmly, but in a way so as not to hurt him.\n\nDon't Miss 15.3 K SHARES 14.4 K SHARES 13.2 K SHARES 2.8 K SHARES 6.5 K SHARES\n\nThe woman, meanwhile, seems perplexed as to what to do to get the monkey and the child separated. The child does not seem to mind the monkey at all. They obviously know each other from before, one can get that from how comfortable they are in each other\u2019s company.\n\nNot all monkey are friendly though. One monkey in Thailand held a kitten 'hostage'.\n\nThe kitten was apparently doing just kitten things, wandering outside a home in Royong, Thailand, when the monkey in question simply \u2018kidnapped it\u2019 and took it to the rooftop of a house. What happened next shocked onlookers - it tried to force-feed the kitten some bananas.\n\nI guess it's just like it is with humans. Some are good some are bad. But imagine being validated by a monkey though. Dogs are easy to impress, but monkeys, they seem like no-bullshit animals. The little kid might really be special.", "description": "Animals can have unfathomably strong bond with humans. People who have pets would understand this.
