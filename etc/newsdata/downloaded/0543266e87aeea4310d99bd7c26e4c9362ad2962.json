India imposed a security lockdown in August on the India-administered region, detaining thousands and cutting off telecommunications for days.\n\nOther fake apps mimicked a pornography website, a dating chat service and a disaster relief organization, the Ansar Foundation.\n\nThe apps often utilized Google\u2019s GOOG, +1.08% Android operating system and were distributed through email or on social media messaging services such as WhatsApp.\n\nBlackberry, a former mobile phone giant now shifted to the security business, says the campaigns reflect a global trend of hackers targeting mobile devices because people use them for work and in their personal lives.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we saw examples where they were targeting specific individuals,\u201d said the company\u2019s Brian Robison. \u201cIt was more of a broad stroke.\u201d\n\nBlackberry\u2019s report also outlines ongoing smartphone malware campaigns in other parts of the world in which hackers appear to be acting in the interests of the Chinese, Iranian, Vietnamese and North Korean governments. One common thread among the different campaigns: they interwove mobile malware into more conventional strategies targeting desktop computers.\n\nRobison said many people have been falsely lulled into thinking their phones are more trustworthy.\n\n\u201cWe put a lot of trust in the public app stores to try to keep us safe,\u201d he said.", "description": "A report by Canadian company Blackberry details new espionage campaigns that are trying to steal sensitive data from mobile devices", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GH584_BlackB_ZG_20180418142836.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
