They repelled the attack and inside the house found Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez.\n\nThe house was then surrounded by heavily armed gunmen who had \u201ca greater force\u201d and authorities decided to suspend the operation, Durazo said. He did not say if Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n was arrested or went free.\n\n\u201cWith the goal of safeguarding the well-being and tranquility of Culiacan society, officials in the security cabinet decided to suspend the actions,\u201d said Durazo.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

People could be seen running for cover as machinegun fire rattled around them. Drivers drove in reverse frantically to get away from the clashes.\n\n\u201cNothing is working,\u201d said Ricardo Gonz\u00e1lez, a worker in the state\u2019s congress who shut himself up in his house after picking up his 15-year-old son from school. \u201cThere is a psychosis. No one knows what is going on but everyone is afraid and they have told us to not come in to work tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSinaloa public safety director Crist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda told Milenio television that there were people wounded but did not provide a casualty figure. He did not rule out that there were deaths.\n\nCasta\u00f1eda said gunmen blocked streets with burning vehicles, a common tactic to make it difficult for security forces to maneuver. Simultaneously, some 20 to 30 prisoners escaped though some were quickly recaptured, he said.\n\nState officials asked residents to avoid going out in parts of city.\n\nSinaloa\u2019s soccer club Dorados announced that it had cancelled its game Thursday due to security concerns.\n\nGov. Quirino Ordaz confirmed that school classes had been suspended but that businesses would open on Friday.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez, however, doubted this.\n\n\u201cThere is no public transportation, no taxis, people outside the city remain blocked outside and tomorrow will be the same,\u201d he said, adding that Culiacan had not seen such a scene for almost a decade, when the Sinaloa Cartel was experiencing an internal war.\n\nSinaloa is home to the cartel by the same name, which was led by \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. Guzm\u00e1n was sentenced to life in prison in the United States in July. He has many children.\n\nAfter Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s third arrest in 2016, an internal battle for succession began playing out. The battle was resolved with the arrest of Damaso L\u00f3pez Nunez and his son D\u00e1maso L\u00f3pez Serrano, who led a rival faction.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Maria Verza reported from Mexico City.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "An intense gunfight with heavy weapons and burning vehicles blocking roads paralyzed the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state Thursday.", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9s Villarreal", "Mar\u00eda Verza"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19291143145128.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
