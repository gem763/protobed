Or, at least, you have a general idea \u2014 and might only need a refresher about specific model numbers from time to time. If you bought a prebuilt desktop or laptop, you\u2019ve probably long since forgotten what\u2019s inside. Don\u2019t worry, though; it\u2019s not hard to figure out your system\u2019s components in either scenario.\n\nWhy would you care about this information, though? Perhaps you need to know the specific motherboard you have so you can find the correct BIOS update online. Or maybe you\u2019re looking to upgrade your memory (or add on to what you already have), and you need to know your memory\u2019s specs. You might have even read about some new CPU exploit and want to know whether you\u2019re affected (or whether a fix for that will affect your processor\u2019s performance).\n\nSo, how do you tell what\u2019s inside your system? You have a few options.\n\nFind the invoice (or read some boxes)\n\nThe simplest way to figure out what\u2019s in your system is to make sure you save the specifications when you purchase it, assuming you\u2019ve plunked down for a ready-made laptop or desktop. But whether you\u2019ve pieced it together yourself or simply purchased a standard configuration, you should be able to save your specs \u2014 or find them on your invoice \u2014 when you\u2019re purchasing your PC. Save these in a handy place, like your Google Drive or Dropbox, and you\u2019ll always know what\u2019s in your system. It\u2019s as easy as that.\n\nIf you build your PC yourself, it never hurts to write down this information in a simple .TXT file. Otherwise, you could always go check the boxes for your components \u2014 you did save the boxes, right? If these are easy to access, it\u2019s a simple way to see what\u2019s in your system. However, if you\u2019ve hidden these boxes away in your garage or crawlspace somewhere, you might want to explore other, faster options.\n\nDevice Manager is (mostly) your friend\n\nThe next easiest option to get a good idea of most of the key components of your system is to pull up Windows\u2019 Device Manager. First, though, navigate to it through the System window, which you\u2019ll be able to find by typing that word after you click the Start button. Under the (appropriately named) System heading in the System window, you\u2019ll see what kind of processor your system is using and how much RAM you have. (The former is more useful than the latter).\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nFrom there, click on Device Manager in the left sidebar. You\u2019ll now be able to look up components like:\n\nYour disk drives (the type should be listed when you expand the menu)\n\nYour graphics card / setup (under \u201cdisplay adapters\u201d)\n\nYour monitor\n\nYour CPU (again)\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nThe information you get from Device Manager, plus a quick web search, should be all you need for most of your system\u2019s components. But there\u2019s still a bit more information you might need to know about what\u2019s inside your computer, so we\u2019re not done quite yet.\n\nTry some third-party utilities if you need to keep digging\n\nYou learned a bit from device manager, but some specs probably still elude you \u2014 for example, the specifics of your RAM that you\u2019d need to know if you were looking to buy more of the same sticks, or which motherboard you\u2019re actually using so you can figure out BIOS updates, future upgrades and troubleshooting. And if you weren\u2019t able to learn anything critical from System or Device Manager, you might need some extra firepower.\n\nI absolutely love this free utility, because it gives you a wealth of information about \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 your system\u2019s processor, RAM configuration and motherboard. Download and run CPU-Z, and you\u2019ll see:\n\nYour processor\u2019s exact name (and codename)\n\nYour processor\u2019s socket (useful, if you\u2019re looking to upgrade or buy an aftermarket cooler)\n\nYour motherboard\u2019s manufacturer, model and chipset\n\nYour motherboard\u2019s graphical interface (to ensure that graphics card upgrade you\u2019re eyeing will actually work on your system)\n\nYour memory type, frequency and part number \u2014 pretty much everything you need to order more (or replace it, assuming you bought correctly the first time)\n\nWhat free RAM slots you have, if any, on your motherboard\n\nYour exact GPU and its manufacturer\n\nWhile there are certainly more things you might want to know about, say, your motherboard\u2019s exact configuration before you start doing some upgrades \u2014 what SATA version it supports on its various connections, for example, which might help you decide whether it\u2019s even worth it to stuff another SSD in your system \u2014 CPU-Z will at least give you the final pieces of the puzzle you might need in order to look this information up manually.\n\nOther utilities worth exploring\n\nIf you want a prettier-looking way to see all of your system\u2019s specs in one place, I also recommend freeware version of Speccy \u2014 you can\u2019t go wrong.\n\nHWiNFO is also a great, free utility that provides similar information about your system:", "description": "Windows: If you built your PC, odds are good that you know what\u2019s in it.
