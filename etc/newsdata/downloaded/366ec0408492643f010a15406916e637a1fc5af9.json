Will it be progress \u2013 or further paralysis?\n\nThere's no question what the public wants. Exhausted by years of deadlock, our poll shows they've had enough.\n\nStagnation has become the norm. Worse still, the opposition parties constantly whine that Mr Johnson (pictured) is not fit for office, yet don't have the guts to call an election\n\nHalf of respondents believe MPs should approve the Brexit deal today, against just 38 per cent who don't.\n\nAnd significantly, if it fails, only 21 per cent believe it would be solely Boris Johnson's fault \u2013 with twice that number blaming Parliament.\n\nThis augurs well for the Prime Minister in a future election \u2013 as does the five-point spike in the party's overall poll lead.\n\nBut the wider truth is that Britain needs its democratic institutions to start working again. While the Commons has been bickering over Brexit, the things people really care about \u2013 the NHS, schools, law and order \u2013 are being neglected.\n\nStagnation has become the norm. Worse still, the opposition parties constantly whine that Mr Johnson is not fit for office, yet don't have the guts to call an election.\n\nSo will our zombie Parliament redeem itself by passing this deal?\n\nSadly, the DUP won't support it because of issues over the new customs arrangements and consent. (This, despite the fact that Lord Trimble, that giant of Ulster Unionism, is fully behind it).\n\nWithout them, the Prime Minister must win over three other groups to prevail \u2013 his own ERG hardliners, the 21 MPs he expelled from the party last month for voting against him and around 20 Labour MPs who represent Leave-voting constituencies.\n\nThere's no doubt this latter group has a dilemma.\n\nOn one hand are their constituents, who want Brexit done. On the other is their party leadership who apparently don't.\n\nWe say apparently, because they change their mind so often that it's hard to tell.\n\nThey say this deal is a ruse; that Mr Johnson is a Right-wing extremist, bent on using it to dilute workers' rights.\n\nIt's utter rot, of course. Boris is the very model of a liberal One-Nation Tory, as his time as London mayor proved.\n\nBut today's Labour is not interested in the truth \u2013 only in trashing any proposal the Government suggests.\n\nAn amendment from Sir Oliver Letwin (pictured) and supported by Labour would withhold Commons approval of the deal until all legislation required to enact it was completed\n\nDefying the party whip is never easy. But we hope the Labour dissenters will refuse to be bullied, act on their conscience and back this deal.\n\nThey \u2013 and the Tory 21 \u2013 must also disregard the siren voices of those who, even at this late stage, want to inflict yet more delay on the long-suffering public.\n\nAn amendment from Sir Oliver Letwin and supported by Labour would withhold Commons approval of the deal until all legislation required to enact it was completed.\n\nWhile not a killer blow, under the Benn Act, this would almost certainly force the Prime Minister to request a further extension of Article 50. Really, haven't we had enough extensions already?\n\nMeanwhile, there's also talk of a Liberal Democrat plot for a second referendum \u2013 a divisive exercise which would solve nothing. It would just create more delay. Delay, delay, delay.\n\nIt's no exaggeration to say MPs hold this country's future prosperity and wellbeing in their hands today.\n\nWe appeal to them to stop dithering and get the deal done. For all our sakes, end this agonising limbo and let the country finally move forward.\n\nEnough procrastination.
