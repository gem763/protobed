The metal has\n\ndeclined more than 1.3% over the week.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCv1 dipped 0.8% to $1,503.90.\n\n\"The main reason gold is down is because the U.S. dollar is\n\nstrengthening to its highest level against the euro in more than\n\ntwo years,\" said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg.\n\n\"However, we have seen massive exchange-traded fund inflows\n\ninto gold in the past few days. This shows people are buying on\n\ndips and we may see further buying with prices now below $1,500\n\nbecause the outlook for gold is still bullish.\"\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of rivals climbed\n\nto a three-week peak as heightened risks from political tensions\n\nin the United States strengthened its safe-haven appeal. USD/\n\nA whistleblower report released on Thursday said that U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump abused his position in attempting to\n\nsolicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 U.S. election and\n\nthat the White House tried to \"lock down\" evidence of his\n\nconduct. On the trade front, meanwhile, China's top diplomat said the\n\ncountry is willing to buy more U.S. products and that trade\n\ntalks wih the United States would yield results. This came after Trump praised Chinese purchases and said\n\nthat a trade deal could come sooner than people thought.\n\nThese positive signals on trade lifted European shares,\n\noffseting worries over economic growth and rising political\n\nrisks.
