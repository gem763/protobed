'It is with immense pleasure that I announce the death of my student loans. On August 2, 2019, after 6 years, I finally killed them. It was a slow death but was worth every bit of the fight.'\n\nMandy Velez celebrated paying off her student loan debt with a photo shoot at Trinity Church, New York last week\n\nVelez graduated from University of Pittsburgh in 2013 and says she achieved her goal without financial help from her parents or boyfriend\n\nShe paid last of debts in eight months. Velez is seen smiling 10 weeks ago after paying off her debt\n\nVelez has been sharing her journey online over the past eight months and explains that she moved to the Big Apple with $75,000 in loan debt but opted to pay more than the minimum due.\n\nShe described forking out $1,000 each month instead of $300 as being 'like another rent' but didn't miss a payment despite being laid\u2013off at one point. 'I took jobs not based on what I really wanted but what could help me survive. I did this for five years straight,' she explained, adding that she 'hustled like hell'.\n\nVelez added the disclaimer that while she doesn't have people dependent on her, she too has not been dependent on anybody to achieve her goal.\n\n'DING DONG MY LOANS ARE DEAD,' she wrote on Instagram. 'It is with immense pleasure that I announce the death of my student loans. On August 2, 2019, after 6 years, I finally killed them'\n\nShe earned extra money by asking for raises at work, doing dog walking, cat sitting and more. Throughout that time she was laid off, had rent to pay but never missed a loan payment\n\nVelez has been sharing her journey on social media and admitted that cutting back on food expenses and ride shares helped\n\n'It was more than most people can do, and I, a single, childless, able-bodied woman consider myself lucky,' she admitted. 'But still, I carried this burden alone. I never asked for or received help. No one ever paid my bills.'\n\nVelez said that she stepped up her challenge last year by working several jobs, buying cheap groceries and missing out on social outings.\n\n'Last fall, something in me broke,' Velez continued. 'Maybe it was feeling like my life was on hold, but I just remember thinking I was DONE. I didn't want to owe anyone anything more. I wanted to start saving for my future. A house. Kids. A life. 'I cut my budget and lived off of less than a third of my monthly salary\u2026. Was it easy? No. Worth it? I'm smiling in a cemetery. 102K lifted from my back. You tell me.'\n\nHOW SHE PAID IT OFF Food prep: 'I cut my food budget down to merely salad, eggs, chicken and rice.' Public transportation: 'Turns out, packing lunches and not taking Ubers can save you a ton.' Cheap dates: 'I said \"no\"\u2014my God I said no\u2014to making memories with my family and friends and prayed there would be other opportunities in the future.' Pay raises: 'I worked my ass off at work and asked for raises, and got them.' Side hustles: 'I worked three jobs at once, my day job and then side hustles. I walked dogs until my feet literally bled. In the cold. In the rain. In the heat. Nothing was beneath me. 'I babysat. I cat sat. I stayed up for 24 hours straight to make a few hundred bucks as a TV extra on shows they filmed overnight.\n\nIn a thank you post she acknowledged her friends 'who didn't stop talking to me after I turned down so many hangouts', the Tatti Family 'who fed me so many times and made sure I never felt without' and her boyfriend Zach 'who made sure we still got date nights even if they consisted of walks to the park with me and the dogs'.\n\nVelez also credited the foresight of her mother who 'saved me from a year more of debt by encouraging me to go to a state school first, even though we sobbed together when the financial aid to Syracuse and Boston wasn't enough'.\n\nOver the past few months Velez has shown support for 2020 Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, who has proposed that students loan debt is capped at $50,000 per borrower.\n\nVelez explained that sharing how she paid off her debt was not a message to prove that if she can do anyone can.\n\n'Not everyone can do this. Maybe due to lack of jobs, ability or other compounding responsibilities, because truth be told, it's a rigged game,' Velez went on. 'But here's the thing, people's futures should never be a game. I celebrate my freedom but I don't feel we student borrowers deserve the hardship that comes with these loans: high interest rates, sketchy providers, yearly tuition hikes, the list goes on.\n\n'My hope is that my story inspires people to say 'no more' the best way they can\u2026 Maybe it's by voting for policy that makes the system much more fair. Any little bit of action helps\u2026 'I ended the cycle of literally 'paying' simply for wanting a better future. For being a 'have not.' Well not anymore. It's all mine now. I'm free.'\n\nVelez has said she recently finished replenishing her emergency fund and will continue saving to pay off taxes for the side projects she earned money for. But before she starts setting money aside for a down payment on a house, she has her sights set on a vacation to Sicily next year.\n\n'A cool thing about paying off debt is now having that extra income for ME. And the things *I* want to save for. Not filling the pockets of predatory lenders with insanely high interest rates. Feels amazing,' Velez said.\n\nLast fall she decided to drastically cut down on expenses and pay off the debt once and for all.
