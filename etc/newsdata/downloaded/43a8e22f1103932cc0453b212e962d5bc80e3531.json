(AP) - When people talk about playing rugby, the first thing a non-rugby player usually thinks is, \u201cOK . lots of bruises, maybe a broken bone or two at some point .\u201d Scrums. Crazy. A crazy sport.\n\nSo when Laura Bedoya, a junior political science and Latin American studies major at UConn from East Haven, started to describe how she played underwater rugby . wait, what? Rugby . under water?\n\n\u201cThe reaction is always, \u2018Wait, what?\u2019\u201d Bedoya said, laughing. \u201cI always have a video ready on my phone. I\u2019m always trying to recruit ex-swimmers and they\u2019re like, \u2018No, I\u2019m good, I don\u2019t want to do that.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou know what sounds really scary to me? Land rugby.\u201d\n\nSo I went to see what underwater rugby is all about Thursday night at the Connecticut Makos\u2019 practice at the Wilbur Cross High school pool in New Haven. Laura\u2019s father Jose, who played the sport in Colombia, where he grew up, started the team about 18 years ago when he and his wife Eliana came to the United States and settled in East Haven.\n\nThis year, the Makos won the North American League national women\u2019s club championship and will head to Germany Nov. 22-24 to compete in the Champions Cup.\n\nAll three of the Bedoya girls - Laura and her younger sisters Daniela and Isabela - play. All three are former competitive swimmers. Jose is a swim coach as well and still plays. Eliana used to play but she is more like the club manager now. The boys and girls play together in New Haven but on the national level, the teams are separate.\n\nThe sport is relatively unknown in the U.S. with only seven teams throughout the country. When Jose came to the U.S., the only team he could find was in Boston, so he decided to start his own.\n\n\u201cWe traveled there, they came here, and we played together,\u201d Eliana said. \u201cPeople from Colombia immigrate here and that\u2019s how the sport has been expanding.\u201d\n\nThe sport, which started in a diving club in Germany in the early 1960s, involves a weighted ball and two goals that are sunk on the bottom of either side of the width of the swimming pool. Teams have 12 players and six at a time are in the water - two defenders, two goalies and two forwards - and the object is to put the ball in the basket. The other six are on the pool deck, waiting to substitute in when their partner comes up for a breather and flops onto the pool deck like a seal coming out of the water.\n\n\u201cA lot of our training is focused on apnea,\u201d said Laura, who is also a member of the national women\u2019s team. \u201cI guess what gets people scared is that you\u2019re going to die because you\u2019re holding your breath. But you know how far you can push yourself. The apnea training really helps and going into the game with a low heart rate really helps. If your heart rate is up and you\u2019re nervous, you\u2019re going to run out of breath faster.\u201d\n\nThe players wear snorkels and masks so when they surface, they can breath and still look down and see where the action is underneath, and flippers so they can swim faster and stay underwater.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly the best spectator sport but when they go to the tournaments, Laura said, there are underwater video cameras which show the action on a screen on the pool deck so people can see what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about reaction and knowing your place in the water,\u201d said Laura, who described it as a three-dimensional sport. \u201cYour teammate is your shadow.\u201d\n\nNatasha Samaniego, 14, is a sophomore at Platt High in Meriden. She started swimming with Jose four years ago and he asked her if she wanted to try rugby.\n\n\u201cI like it because it\u2019s a team sport,\u201d Samaniego said. \u201cI like how you get to have a lot of contact with other people.\u201d\n\nSamaniego is not very big. She\u2019s also a goalie. Other players try to push her out of the way while she\u2019s guarding the basket with her back to it. It can get rough down there.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cYou kick and move your hands and try to keep your back down on the goal so when people try to lift you up to put the ball in, they can\u2019t move you. Sometimes with the stronger, bigger people, it\u2019s harder.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no tackling above the neck, no grabbing flippers and no head butting. The ball has to stay underwater. But pretty much anything else goes.\n\nMabel Rivadeneira, 15, is a junior at the Sound School in New Haven and a defender for the Makos.\n\n\u201cI started playing two years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first time I tried it I was like \u2018Oh my goodness, this is crazy.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like it. It was terrifying. I barely knew how to swim so it was way harder for me.\n\n\u201cI stayed for a few months, started participating more and felt more comfortable. Now I like it.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/348R3K7\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Hartford Courant, http://www.courant.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When people talk about playing rugby, the first thing a non-rugby player usually thinks is, \"OK . lots of bruises, maybe a broken bone or two at some point .\" Scrums.
