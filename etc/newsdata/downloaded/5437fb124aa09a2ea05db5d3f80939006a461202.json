I\u2019m just about to have this intravenous drip and this young lady is going to tell you why.\u2019\n\nShirley seems to be on the mend (Picture: Shirley Ballas/Instagram)\n\nShirley will hopefully be better by Saturday (Picture: PA)\n\nKatrina from Reviv explained the drip was a \u2018recovery infusion that\u2019s great if you\u2019re feeling sick, hungover, jet-lagged or just under the weather. It\u2019s pumped with B12, it has an anti-inflammatory medication, vitamin C, magnesium and all the stuff that\u2019ll make Shirley feel better \u2013 especially during this awful weather.\u2019\n\nShirley added on her Instagram story: \u2018Hopefully we\u2019ll be right as rain by Saturday.\u2019\n\nThe caption for Shirley\u2019s video and snaps read: \u2018@revivuk very happy to receive this drip today to help me get well. Full of all sorts of things vitamin c magnesium b12 and the list goes on. Feeling under the weather today as a result of a tough week.\n\n\u2018So @revivuk will have me up and running by Saturday @#gratitude #sick #health #feelingbetter.\u2019\n\nThe scores were all over the place (Picture: BBC)\n\nShirley, dressed in a Moschino hoodie, was smiling away as she enjoyed a cup of tea and a recline while having her drip, so we\u2019re not too worried.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rather rough week for Ms Ballas, as there has been major backlash to her and the judges\u2019 decisions on Saturday and Sunday night.\n\nThe panel \u2013 Shirley, Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse and Bruno Tonioli \u2013 were called out for their \u2018odd\u2019 scoring on Saturday night, after Mike Bushell was awarded a nine and David James received eights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the leaderboard was turned on its head, Viscountess Emma Weymouth and Dev Griffin ended up in the bottom two, and, after the dance-off, the judges chose to send Dev and his partner Dianne Buswell home.\n\nAnd apparently, Shirley received death threats after the decision, which Dianne has called for a stop too.\n\nA fan of the Aussie dancer tweeted: \u2018Please sort your fans out @dbuzz6589& @Joe_Sugg. I get why people are upset & I don\u2019t think it was @dev_101\u2019s time to go. But sending vile abusive tweets & death threats to @ShirleyBallas is totally out of order. Imagine if it was a member of your family on the receiving end.\u2019\n\nDianne, 30, replied: \u2018Guys this is terrible you can not be bullying like this . It\u2019s awful and really upsets me to hear this . It\u2019s simply not ok and should never happen!\u2019\n\nStrictly returns on Saturday night on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
