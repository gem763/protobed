Representing sanctioned individuals as a lawyer is allowed, but unlicensed lobbying for them\u2014not so much.\n\n\u201cThis is a rather clear-cut area of law, and lobbyists would be personally playing with fire if they ignore their legal obligations,\u201d explained Tyler Cullis, an expert on U.S. economic sanctions at the law firm Ferrari & Associates.\n\nFawaz certainly has experience with sanctioned entities. A Government Accountability Project investigation for The Daily Beast shows that before he became Federal Advocates\u2019 Senior Director of International Affairs Fawaz had stints at sanctioned institutions which, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, were used by Hezbollah and a notorious drug trafficker.\n\nFawaz says that these institutions\u2014like his potential clients\u2014were unfairly sanctioned.\n\n\u201cI approached the firm so that I can help people to have a fair chance,\u201d Fawaz said in an email responding to our questions. \u201cPeople that have been unrightfully sanctioned\u2026 in case people want to do business with sections of the american [sic] government.\u201c\n\nFor now, Federal Advocates\u2019 President Michael Esposito is sticking with Fawaz\u2014even as he downplayed the firm\u2019s connections to him. \u201cAs the Firm\u2019s client base expands into new regions (internationally and domestically) we sometimes bring in advisers to provide consultation to the Firm on business and political culture and interests. Mr. Fawaz serves in this capacity and is not a full-time employee of the Firm. As an adviser, Mr. Fawaz is not in contact with or working on behalf of any of the Firm\u2019s current or former clients. We are unaware of any charges against Mr. Fawaz,\u201d Esposito said in a statement. He did not respond to follow-up questions.\n\n\u201c Michael Esposito is the only D.C. lobbyist who worked for Mr. Trump. No other Washington, D.C. lobbying firm enjoys a previous working relationship with both President Trump and his immediate family. \u201d \u2014 Briefing materials for Federal Advocates lobbying firm\n\nThe firm has high level connections within the Republican Party. Esposito is a member of the Trump Victory Finance Committee and an adviser to President Trump and Ronna Romney McDaniel, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chairwoman.\n\n\u201cMichael Esposito is the only D.C. lobbyist who worked for Mr. Trump,\u201d said a packet of Federal Advocates\u2019 briefing materials, which explained Esposito had helped the president, Eric Trump and Jared Kushner with real estate deals. \u201cNo other Washington, D.C. lobbying firm enjoys a previous working relationship with both President Trump and his immediate family.\u201d\n\nFederal Advocates isn\u2019t exactly risk averse\u2014it recently registered as a lobbyist for Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company accused of helping African governments spy on political opponents and running a secret office in Iran\u2014but working with Fawaz may be too much for the firm\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how Fawaz\u2019 relationship with one of President Trump\u2018s favorite lobbying firms was brokered. The key to answering that question may lie with a web of connections around the late Ahmad Chalabi, known as \u201cthe man who pushed America to war\u201d in Iraq. But before Fawaz connected with the Chalabi network, he worked for his first sanctioned institution.\n\nAfter college, his resume shows he became a \u201cCorporate Finance & Investment Associate\u201d at \u201cHIT a Lebanese [financial institution].\u201d HIT is a reference to Halawi Investment Trust S.A.L., a Lebanese money transfer company.\n\n\u201cI was a junior at the firm,\u201d said Fawaz, when asked about his time at Halawi.\n\nThe Halawi exchange house was used by sanctioned drug kingpin Ayman Joumaa. Joumaa allegedly laundered money for Hezbollah and also allegedly laundered proceeds of Colombian cocaine sales whose shipment to the United States he coordinated with Mexico\u2019s brutal Zetas cartel.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department called Halawi a financial institution \u201cof prime money laundering concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was surprising to me that [Halawi was] sanctioned as I was not part of the firm when they got sanctioned,\u201d Fawaz said. \u201cDuring my time there, my knowledge on the local Lebanese level is that Mr. Halawi is not on good terms with members of Hezbollah.\u201d\n\nAfter Halawi, Fawaz joined another sanctioned money launderer, al-Bilad Islamic Bank in Iraq, which now goes by Al-Ataa Islamic Bank. British corporate records show Fawaz was a director of al-Bilad Bank\u2019s now dissolved offshoot in London, al-Bilad for Investments & Finance P.S.C Limited.\n\nAl-Bilad Bank is run by Aras Habib, a former Fawaz family friend and sanctioned financier who was the intelligence chief for the Iraqi National Congress. That\u2019s the Iraqi dissident group formerly funded by the American intelligence apparatus and run by Ahmad Chalabi, the Iraqi banker and politician known for feeding media and intelligence agencies fake sources on Saddam Hussein\u2019s alleged weapons of mass destruction in the run up to the Iraq War. Today Habib is secretary general of the Iraqi National Congress and a member of Iraq\u2019s parliament.\n\nHabib is allegedly connected to Iranian intelligence. He fled Baghdad for Tehran for a time after an Iraqi arrest warrant was issued in 2004 over allegations of torture, theft and blackmail. The FBI also opened an investigation into whether Habib was the source of a leak of classified information to Iran that the U.S. had cracked the country\u2019s secret codes. The CIA believed Habib was a paid agent of Iran. Habib did not respond to a request for comment, but has previously denied these allegations.\n\nFawaz was close to Habib before a falling out. We obtained photos of Habib and Fawaz at Iraqi National Congress events. Habib even attended Fawaz\u2019 wedding, according to photos Fawaz\u2019 father posted on Facebook, one of which referred to Habib as a \u201cdear member of our family.\u201d\n\nBut in February 2018, Fawaz left al-Bilad Bank \u201cdue to a personal dispute with one of the partners,\u201d he said.\n\nA few months later, in May 2018, Habib and al-Bilad Bank were sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury for \u201cassisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services to or in support of [Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force].\u201d\n\nHabib denied the \u201cfalse allegations\u201d of money laundering in a statement on his website. Fawaz made similar denials to us. \u201cDuring my time at the bank I was in a senior position with Mr. [Aras Habib] Kareem and never did I see any money laundry activities,\u201d Fawaz said.\n\nFawaz added that he and Habib had no connections to Iran or Hezbollah. \u201cMany Iranian banks approached us at the time I was at al-Bilad and Mr. [Aras Habib] Kareem always rejected dealing with them,\u201d Fawaz said.\n\n\u201c The Government Accountability Project reviewed a ledger of nearly $200 million worth of al-Bilad Bank wire transfers signed by Fawaz. \u201d\n\nBut al-Bilad transferred hundreds of millions of dollars into Lebanon. These money transfers led to allegations of money laundering and the implementation of sanctions. And Fawaz was at the center of these transfers.\n\nThe Government Accountability Project reviewed a ledger of nearly $200 million worth of al-Bilad Bank wire transfers, along with other flagged transactions worth tens of millions, from 2016 and 2017, signed by Fawaz, which passed through the Arab African International Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank branches in Dubai, before the money was deposited with Fransabank, Lebanon\u2019s largest bank.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s Central Bank Governor covertly funneled millions of dollars on behalf of the IRGC-QF through Iraq-based al-Bilad Islamic Bank to enrich and support the violent and radical agenda of Hezballah,\u201d said a Treasury Department press release announcing sanctions on al-Bilad.\n\n\u201cThese are the documents that led to Aras Habib being listed on [the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control\u2019s sanctions list],\u201d said a source who provided the wire transfer documentation. \u201cThe only entity who could [move that amount of money] without anyone questioning them is Hezbollah.\u201d\n\nFawaz denied the Fransabank transfers were money laundering for Hezbollah. \u201cFransabank had an Iraqi branch and al-Bilad had a local Lebanese branch the basic thing that was happening was a swap transaction between U.S. dollars al-Bilad had in its local branch in Lebanon and Fransabank\u2019s Iraqi branch in Baghdad,\u201d Fawaz said. \u201cNo third party involved nor did the money get transferred to any other bank or company.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sanctions are illegitimate because the documentation available at the bank and all the transfers involved the origin and destination to be Fransabank,\u201d Fawaz said.\n\nFransabank also denied playing an active role in money laundering connected to Habib, but its account doesn\u2019t absolve al-Bilad Bank. \u201cWe came forward to the U.S. Treasury regarding the topic you are mentioning and held several meetings with them and namely with [Treasury Department Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing] Marshall Billingslea personally,\u201d said Dania Kassar, Fransabank\u2019s Head of Corporate Communications, in response to questions about al-Bilad Bank\u2019s wire transfers. \u201cOur banking system does not allow us to share any information or details with the press... However, and as a matter of public knowledge, our bank has initiated a legal suit against al-Bilad Bank.\u201d\n\n\u201c Federal Advocates has its own connection to Chalabi\u2019s world through one of the firm\u2019s vice presidents, retired Congressman Chris Carney. \u201d\n\n\u201c Bottom line, [in our lawsuit] we are claiming from al-Bilad Bank amounts unpaid to Fransabank,\u201d added Kassar. \u201c The U.S. Treasury has been informed about our intention to act legally against al-Bilad Bank, and later on about the lawsuit itself.\u201d\n\nFawaz blamed al-Bilad Bank\u2019s issues on corruption within the Iraqi Central Bank, which he said was feeding the U.S. Treasury false information. He alleged he had been offered money to burn Habib in front of the U.S. Treasury. Fawaz said he was asked if he would defend Habib in front of a U.S. Treasury Department panel. \u201cI said I would,\u201d Fawaz said.\n\nFederal Advocates said they didn\u2019t hire Fawaz to represent Habib or his other former employers. \u201c Outside of Mr. Fawaz, no one at the Firm has a personal or professional relationship with Halawi Investment Trust, Mr. Aras, al-Bilad Islamic Bank, or Mr. Joumaa. None of them are clients of the Firm,\u201d said Esposito. \u201cFederal Advocates has no relationship with Mr. Aras, Mr. Joumaa, Halawi Investment Trust or al-Bilad Islamic Bank.\u201d\n\nBut Federal Advocates has its own connection to Chalabi\u2019s world through one of the firm\u2019s vice presidents, retired Congressman Chris Carney. Carney is a blue dog Democrat and a former interrogator at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. He also served as a former senior intelligence and terrorism adviser in the Bush Administration Pentagon under prominent neoconservative Douglas Feith, then undersecretary for defense policy.\n\nCarney worked for Feith at the Pentagon\u2019s controversial Office of Special Plans, a tiny group charged with, among other things, locating unfiltered intelligence that countered the CIA\u2019s view that Saddam Hussein was unconnected with al Qaeda and the attack on 9/11. Feith\u2019s office provided that intelligence directly to the Bush White House in order to help make the case for war with Iraq.\n\nWhile working for Feith in the Office of Special Plans, \u201cCarney and [Defense Intelligence Agency analyst Christina] Shelton put together a briefing, based largely on data that the majority of the intelligence community considered dubious or trivial, asserting a significant link between Saddam and bin Laden,\u201d Spencer Ackerman reported in 2006 for the New Republic.\n\nA draft copy of Carney and Shelton\u2019s briefing slides for White House officials, published by the Federation of American Scientists, shows they used false information spread by Chalabi and Habib. \u201cFedayeen Saddam training facility at Salman Pak used to train non-Iraqi terrorists,\u201d one slide said, based on information from supposed Iraqi Army defectors supplied by Chalabi and Habib, according to journalist Aram Roston\u2019s book, The Man Who Pushed America to War: The Extraordinary Life, Adventures, and Obsessions of Ahmad Chalabi.\n\nThere is no credible evidence the Salman Pak facility was used to train al Qaeda terrorists as the briefing hoped to establish. Other parts of the briefing included information that came from Chalabi, including the false allegation that 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had secretly met with Iraqi intelligence agents in Prague in the run-up to the attacks.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know who Fawaz is introducing to Federal Advocates, but if the firm represents any of his friends, it is playing with fire.", "description": "Fawaz answers all our questions about his alleged dealings with Iran, Hezbollah, and a notorious drug trafficker.
