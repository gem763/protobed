That beat expectations of analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nBut the company lost $463.5 million in the quarter compared with a $249.2 million loss a year ago. More than half of the loss came from stock-based compensation and payroll tax expenses related to its initial public offering.\n\nOn the bright side, Lyft\u2019s executives emphasized they believe the company will turn a profit in the fourth quarter of 2021, a year earlier than they had previously projected.\n\nOne reason for optimism: the company is providing far fewer discounted rides than it did a year ago, said Brian Roberts, Lyft\u2019s chief financial officer, in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nLyft is also focusing on more profitable rides, such as airport or business trips, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are very focused on profitable growth, not growth at all costs,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nThe money-losing company has struggled to demonstrate a path to profitability, just like its larger rival Uber.\n\nIts share price, which hovered around $44 Wednesday afternoon, has lost about 39% of its value since its stock market debut in March.\n\nBut Roberts sought to differentiate Lyft from Uber. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing food. We\u2019re not doing trucking. We are 100% focused on our transportation network,\u201d he said.\n\nLyft\u2019s number of active riders grew 28% to surpass 22 million.\n\nLyft is pursuing more partnerships with businesses, universities and medical organizations to provide rides for their customers and employees, which lead to high-value rides and more growth opportunities, said John Zimmer, president and co-founder, in a conference call with investors.\n\nThe revenue growth was solid, but the cost of generating that revenue - expenses such as paying drivers - reached $580.7 million, meaning the cost as a percentage of revenue grew compared to the same time last year, said Dan Morgan, vice president and senior portfolio manager for Synovus Trust Company.\n\n\u201cNot to pick at a good report, but obviously the goal is to get costs and expenses down as much as possible so they can drive a profit,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou want those numbers to be going the other way.\u201d\n\nLyft\u2019s quarterly losses included $86.6 million related to changes in how much insurance regulatory agencies require. After accounting for those and other expenses such as those related to the IPO, Lyft\u2019s adjusted net loss was $121.6 million in the third quarter, compared with $245.3 million a year ago.\n\nLyft is committed to hitting its new profitability timeline despite California\u2019s recent passage of a law that requires ride-hailing companies to treat drivers as employees, Roberts said. That costly change could entitle its drivers to minimum wage, benefits and workers compensation, among other things. Uber and Lyft proposed a ballot initiative Tuesday to exempt ride-hailing companies from the new law.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lyft is continuing to lose staggering sums of money as it barrels ahead with impressive revenue growth, but its executives said they believe the company will turn a corner and reach profitability in about two years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cathy Bussewitz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/earns_lyft_59940_c0-139-3341-2087_s1200x700.jpg?282b559b9ad06bb82533c6441ee15b6bb6aaba0e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
