Ultimately, though, writing occupied the heart of their discussion. Styron, author of the well-loved novels Lie Down in Darkness, The Confessions of Nat Turner, and Sophie\u2019s Choice, was then working on a novel about World War II called The Way of the Warrior. He was notorious for long gaps between books and this one was turning out to be no different. But this one he never finished. The story you\u2019re about to read is interrupted halfway through by Styron\u2019s hospitalization for depression. A few years later, Styron instead published a fascinating account of his disease, Darkness Visible, a slim volume remarkable for its honesty and concision. Styron was candid about his illness with Caputo here in \u201cStyron\u2019s Choices,\u201d which originally appeared in the December 1986 of Esquire and is reprinted here with the author\u2019s permission.

At some point during our browsing, my classmate pulled two paperbacks from the shelf and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to read this guy. He\u2019s terrific.\u201d The books were William Styron\u2019s Lie Down in Darkness and The Long March.", "description": "A white southerner by birth, Styron scorned the label of regional author\u2014the world was his territory and the bigger the subject the better, from American slavery to the Holocaust.", "authors": ["Philip Caputo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492182141/articles/2015/04/18/the-stacks-william-styron-was-lit-s-big-game-hunter/150417-belth-styron-tease_hpovdz", "published_at": "2015-04-18"}
