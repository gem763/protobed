The party had also called for a referendum including independence from the mainland as an option.\n\nHe had since clarified his position, saying the referendum would be non-binding. He also made clear he did not support Hong Kong\u2019s separation from the rest of China, not even as an option.\n\nThe incumbent councillor of South Horizons West is Judy Chan Ka-pui of the New People\u2019s Party. Just before deadline last week, Kelvin Lam Ho-por also enrolled and was widely believed to be Wong\u2019s substitute in case the activist was barred from running.", "description": "The pro-democracy activist was disqualified because an electoral officer believed he couldn't be loyal to mainland China", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/a4dfce9c-f4a3-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires112130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
