REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo\n\nThe admission from the country\u2019s biggest company by revenue prompted a government agency to say it would investigate Woolworths, as well as a call from an opposition politician for a parliamentary inquiry into what he called \u201cwage theft\u201d in Australia.\n\nThe underpayment of workers has emerged as a hot-button issue this year but Woolworths\u2019 disclosure is the biggest by far, increasing the odds that the government will be prompted into more action.\n\nWoolworths said a routine internal review found the salaries it had paid to about 5,700 permanent employees failed to take into account an allowance for overtime which they should have received under industrial laws.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re unequivocally sorry and we\u2019re going to repay the money, no questions asked,\u201d said Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci on an earnings call, overshadowing a robust rise in first-quarter sales.\n\nWoolworths added that the underpayments may date back to 2010, and said it would contact staff who had left. It plans to start making the repayments by the end of the year.\n\nThe grocery giant estimates it will have to repay between A$200 million and A$300 million. At the top end of the range, the amount is equivalent to around A$52,600 per person.\n\nGovernment agency the Fair Work Ombudsman said it was \u201cshocked that yet another large, publicly listed company has ... admitted to breaching Australia\u2019s workplace laws on a massive scale\u201d.\n\nIt will investigate Woolworths, which reported the breach itself and \u201chold them to account\u201d, it added.\n\nShadow industrial relations minister Tony Burke of the centre-left Labor party said in a statement he wanted a parliamentary inquiry into \u201cthe reasons for wage and superannuation theft, the cost of wage theft to the economy, the best means of uncovering and deterring such theft, and the taxation treatment of those affected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Woolworths has today come forward and committed to paying its workers what they\u2019re owed, it should not have taken this long to uncover these underpayments,\u201d the statement said.\n\nA SPATE OF SCANDALS\n\nOther companies embroiled in wage scandals this year include Super Retail Group Ltd (SUL.AX), a seller of auto, sports and outdoor goods. It said in February it had underpaid managers by A$43 million, an acknowledgement that forced the departure of its CEO.\n\nSince then, one of Australia\u2019s best-known celebrity chefs, George Calombaris, admitted to underpaying restaurant staff nearly A$8 million while jeweler Michael Hill International Ltd (MHJ.AX) has said it underpaid staff A$25 million.\n\nRetail conglomerate Wesfarmers (WES.AX) said this month that about 6,000 staff at its industrial and safety business were underpaid by about $15 million since 2010, while its Bunnings unit last month said there was a payroll issue relating to pension payments.\n\nBusiness groups have argued that because the wage system is complex, they shouldn\u2019t be penalised for errors. Some of the companies caught up in underpayment problems have also blamed software or technical errors.\n\nThe Australian Industry Group, a group representing more than 60,000 companies, said in a discussion paper this week there was an important distinction between \u201cemployers that have made genuine mistakes which have led to miscalculations and underpayments, and employers that deliberately underpay their employees.\u201d\n\nMany instances of incorrect payments were the result of misunderstanding or error and employers should not be at risk of being labelled a \u201cthief\u201d for such mistakes, it added.\n\nWoolworths\u2019 wage disclosure clouded a bigger-than-expected jump in supermarket sales, which were up 6.6% on a same-store basis for the three months to end-September as it benefited from a wildly popular \u201cLion King\u201d collectable toy promotion.\n\nBy comparison, smaller rival Coles Group Ltd (COL.AX) on Tuesday reported much slower same-store supermarket sales growth of 0.1%.\n\nShares in Woolworths closed down 1.4%, underperforming an 0.8% decline for the broader market.\n\n($1 = 1.4562 Australian dollars)", "description": "Woolworths Group Ltd said it had underpaid thousands of supermarket workers for years and will need to repay as much as A$300 million ($200 million), the latest and most high-profile company to be caught up in wage scandals across corporate Australia.", "authors": ["Byron Kaye", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446397833&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T06A", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
