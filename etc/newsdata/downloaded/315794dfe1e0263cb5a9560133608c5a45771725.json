They brilliantly defended 54 runs in the last five overs despite having well-set Haris at the crease.\n\nEarlier, while batting first, Sri Lanka\u2019s sinking ship was sailed by exceptional Debutant Oshada Fernando who struck 78 runs off 48 balls to help his team post 147-6 on the scoreboard.\n\nOshada comes at the crease on 30-3 and the visitors were facing immense pressure but he kept his nerves calm and single-handedly started scoring runs despite wickets falling at the other hand.\n\nThe right-handed batsman struck eight boundaries and three sixes in a special knock.\n\nEarlier, Mohammad Amir put the Islanders under pressure by picking up their in-form opener Danushka Gunathilaka in the third over.\n\nImad Wasim, right in the next over, got rid of Sadeera Samarawickrama immediately after Shadab Khan dropped a simple catch at mid-off on previous delivery. He scored 12 runs.\n\nAmir came up with yet another impressive strike to reduce Sri Lanka to 30-3. Asif Ali took a blinder on the boundary line to counter Bhanuka Rajapaksa flick at deep-backward square leg.\n\nFernando joined hands with skipper Dasun Shanaka at 58-4 and they both raced the team\u2019s total to 134-5 with Fernando keeping the strike for most of the time. Shanaka managed to score just 12 runs. They partnered for scoring for 76 runs.\n\nAmir took three wickets and conceded 27 runs in his four overs while Imad Wasim and Wahab Riaz shared a wicket apiece.\n\nIn reply, Pakistan lost its opener Fakhar Zaman without getting off the mark. Babar Azam and Haris then raced the score of Pakistan as they put 74 runs together on the feather board.\n\nBabar scored 27 runs before getting caught behind off Lahiru Kumara. Sarfraz Ahmed and Iftikhar Ahmed scored 17 runs each but results remained the same as they were in the last two contests.\n\nHasaranga De Silva took three wickets for Sri Lanka while Lahiru Kumara bagged two wickets.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Sri Lankan captain Dasun Shanaka have won the toss and decided to bat first against Pakistan in the third and last T20I at Gaddafi Stadium Lahore on Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Wicket.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
