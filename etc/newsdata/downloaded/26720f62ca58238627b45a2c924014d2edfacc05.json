Solskjaer probably knew that and so did the club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They were never going to get back to winning leagues and European cups with those players who have left. I disliked watching that group of players for two or three years. There was a lot not to like.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t believe the guy at the top should be there doing it anymore, I think he has had his chance but that is another story.\n\n\u2018The club has gone backwards in some senses in the short-term for what would be I think a better position in the longer term.\n\nAt the moment from a football point of view they are well short in terms of quality and getting back to winning the league, but at least I like them, which is a start.\n\n\u2018I think the fans like them more, and they like the manager more.\n\n\u2018They have got to add another two or three transfer windows like they have had with [Aaron] Wan-Bissaka, [Daniel] James and [Harry] Maguire.\n\n\u2018They have panicked in previous summers so at least they didn\u2019t panic in the summer.\u2019", "description": "Gary Neville has urged the Glazers to remove Ed Woodward from running the football side of Manchester United.
