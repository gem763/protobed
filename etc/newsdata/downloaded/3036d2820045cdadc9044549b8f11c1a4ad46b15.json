Or at times when our life is spiraling down, these friends make us feel like we belong. It's these friends we can go to when everyone else has given up on us, and they will make us feel loved all over again.\n\nThis is for those friends who we'll never forget for their unwavering loyalty.\n\nPexels\n\nDon't Miss 1.4 K SHARES 153 SHARES 911 SHARES\n\nMind you, these friends could have easily walked out from our life. Considering we give way less than how much they give us. But these god sent angels stuck around in our worst times. They gave us courage to fight. Courage to survive. It could be in the form of a text that reads, \"Don't be sad, it won't last forever\" and just these seven words will fill us with hope, something no one else can do.\n\nAnd somehow these friends always manage to make time for us. Squeeze us into their busy schedules. And that's how they make us feel like a priority.\n\nAlso, it doesn't just end with them providing a shoulder for us to cry on. They are also the friends who we have a bloody good time with. The kind of friends with whom everything feels like an adventure and how a simple lunch can also feel exciting. It's their ability to make everyday full of smiles and fun that makes them impossible to forget.\n\nUnsplash\n\nAll we want to say to such friends is a big thank you for being so selfless. For giving us a forever, in a world where nothing is permanent.\n\nThank you for your friendship. It's a real honour. And that's also why we will never forget them.", "description": "This is to the friends who have been there for all along and how they very beautifully continue to prove to us everyday that they will be there for us.
