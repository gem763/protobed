Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is standing firm in the face of scrutiny, and so are her supporters, who are sharing their own stories on Twitter of when they faced discrimination because of pregnancy.\n\nThe 2020 presidential candidate tweeted Tuesday to reiterate that she had been edged out of her first teaching job when she became pregnant. She had been responding to unsubstantiated accusations that she had actually voluntarily resigned. \u201cWe can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours,\u201d she added.\n\nWhen I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant\u2014and the principal told me the job I'd already been promised for the next year would go to someone else. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 8, 2019\n\nThis was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination\u2014but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 8, 2019\n\nThe conservative website Washington Free Beacon on Monday surfaced the minutes from an April 1971 board of education meeting showing a unanimous vote to extend Warren\u2019s teaching contract, two months before her exit in June.\n\nThis does not necessarily contradict Warren\u2019s story, which is that her contract was renewed in April but that by June, when she was six months\u2019 pregnant, the principal \u201cshowed her the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you\u2019ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours \u2015 \u2018We\u2019re giving it to someone else\u2019 \u2015 I think that\u2019s being shown the door,\u201d Warren told CBS News on Monday.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon also cast doubt on Warren\u2019s account by noting she had once described her exit from the job differently in a 2007 interview, when she said: \u201c[I] said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u2019 I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to explain this, Warren told CBS she wasn\u2019t comfortable delving into the discrimination aspect publicly until later in her career.\n\nOn Tuesday, after Warren\u2019s tweets, people on Twitter shared their own experiences of job discrimination due to pregnancy, or those of their friends and family.\n\nHere are some of those stories:\n\nMy wife was put on a 90 day Performance Improvement Plan with metrics no one in the company could hit...the day she returned from maternity leave. 90 days later they let her go. \u2014 Greg Trumbold (@GregTrumbold) October 8, 2019\n\nWhen I was 7 months pregnant in 2012, my boss hauled me into his office and chewed me out for \u201cputting [him] in a real bind by going on maternity leave.\u201d That\u2019s a quote. He then demanded I return after six weeks and immediately start working 60-hour weeks. \u2014 Amy King (@AmyRhody) October 8, 2019\n\nI shared my mother's story yesterday, but it turned out I got it a little backwards. She wasn't fired for being visibly pregnant, she HID her pregnancy to AVOID being fired.\n\n\n\nHere it is in her own words: pic.twitter.com/iRgU5k5mMs \u2014 Go_Cougars (@design__hole) October 8, 2019\n\nYep. In the late 90s, after 3 years of stellar reviews/promotions, I was suddenly fired within a month of telling my boss I was pregnant. They said I lied when I'd called in sick one day (morning sickness), but went to visit family later. I was young+scared, so I didn't fight it. \u2014 Yiyiyi (@YiyiyiLives) October 8, 2019\n\nOn telling my former boss I was pregnant with my second child he asked, \u201cDid you do that on purpose?\u201d I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know how to answer (or why he was asking) so I lied and said no. \u2014 Paige (@PaigeanThem) October 8, 2019\n\nIn 1983, I was asked if I was planning to have a 2nd child. The reason for the question was obvious. If I was planning on having another child, I would not get the job. Young people of today don\u2019t know this was real life in the 70\u2019s and 80s \u2014 queenbee3 (@queenbee3) October 8, 2019\n\nIn 2003, I was laid off from my job, and found out a week later that I was pregnant. When I started a new job, I was showing. The 70 yo white man who was my boss told me that my pregnancy was inconvenient, and he wouldn't have hired me if he had known. \u2014 J Lynch (@jlynch0298) October 8, 2019\n\nDo you have a similar story of job discrimination due to pregnancy?
