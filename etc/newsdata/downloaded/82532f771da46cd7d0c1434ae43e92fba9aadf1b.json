We decided to put them to the test\u2026 by: Carmen Williams | 09 Oct 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nI love a good food-hack Facebook video. But, like you, I\u2019ve always wondered whether they actually work or not. So I decided to put them to the test\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that I followed all the videos\u2019 (limited) directions \u2013 with more instructions, it\u2019s possible that there are different results available. Let us know if you\u2019ve found that to be the case!\n\n\n\nThese are the results:\n\n\n\n1. Cutting perfect tomato slices with the help of a fork\n\n\n\nThis one sort of works. You\u2019ll get nice, even slices for about half the tomato, but then you need to move the fork and it gets messy. Also, having to hold the fork and tomato at the same time while you cut is a bit difficult.\n\n\n\nUsing a fork to ensure your Tomatoes are cut evenly. Ja it works but it's silly and awkward to handle. Plus you cant do the entire tomato at once pic.twitter.com/8qk4TpGrfo \u2014 Winifred Sanderson stan ??????? (@Carmzjw) September 27, 2019\n\n2. Make popcorn by microwaving a mielie in a bag\n\n\n\nI laughed and laughed when I first saw this and I KNEW it wasn\u2019t going to work because of logic and reasons, but I did it anyway. You know what happens? You get a burnt mielie. That\u2019s it.\n\n\n\n3. Water + oven = stale bread fresh again\n\n\n\nThis didn\u2019t work for me. Someone on Twitter told me I did it wrong, but I followed the directions in the video: pour water over bread and then put it in the oven for eight minutes. That\u2019s what I did and I basically got toast. The bread was indeed soft on the inside, but I\u2019m not sure this one really works.\n\n\n\n4. Bake a hard avo to \u2018ripen\u2019 it\n\n\n\nI covered the avo in foil and put it in the oven for 10 minutes. You know what I got? A warm avo (that was slightly softer on the outside). I could cut it, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t eat it.\n\n\n\nHave a really hard avo? Wrap it in foil and put it in the oven for 8mins. You know what happens? You get a hard, warm avo. I could just about cut it open but it's not edible pic.twitter.com/w4Yk4rzOJp \u2014 Winifred Sanderson stan ??????? (@Carmzjw) September 27, 2019\n\n5. Peel ginger with a spoon\n\n\n\nFor years I\u2019ve used a knife and it was torture \u2013 plus, I would end up cutting half the ginger away. Using a spoon is an awesome trick that actually works really well.\n\n\n\n6. De-shell boiled eggs by shaking it in a container\n\n\n\nI doubted this one. I thought it was just going to mess water everywhere (it did), but the shell did actually come right off.\n\n\n\n7. Microwave your lemon to maximise on juicing\n\n\n\nThis one works really well; you get so much more juice out!\n\n\n\nWant more juice out of a lemon? Microwave it for about 30 seconds first and it's much easier to squeeze and more juice comes out pic.twitter.com/ARhOlzTHvs \u2014 Winifred Sanderson stan ??????? (@Carmzjw) September 27, 2019\n\n8. Peel garlic by shaking it in a container\n\n\n\nThis one does mostly work, but it\u2019s important to loosen up the clove properly beforehand.\n\n\n\n9. Use a glass to get an avo out of its skin\n\n\n\nThis one definitely works \u2013 I know because I\u2019ve tried it before. Once, I showed it to a friend, who lost her mind and called me a witch. Win-win.\n\n\n\n10. De-shell an egg with a tablespoon\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to use the shaking method, you can also get the shell of a boiled egg with the back of a tablespoon, but you do risk hurting the egg itself.\n\n\n\n11. Make whipped cream in a jar\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve whipped enough cream for Christmas trifles to know that it takes a long time to get the cream to the right consistency, and that it can curdle really quickly. So I had my doubts before beginning to shake and after five minutes, I was proven right. The cream wasn\u2019t anywhere near whipped. (According to the internet, this can work, but it relies on a very specific cream-to-jar ratio that possibly renders the whole thing a bit more effort than it\u2019s worth.)\n\n\n\nMaking whipped cream by shaking it in a jar? Yeah I wasn't convinced to begin with. Now even less so. I shook it for a other two mins after that and nothing. Issa lie pic.twitter.com/1qvRyPMipc \u2014 Winifred Sanderson stan ??????? (@Carmzjw) September 27, 2019\n\nThe lesson? Take those food hacks with a grain of salt \u2013 not all of them actually work, and they\u2019re definitely not magic.\n\n\n\nALSO SEE...
