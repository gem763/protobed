This is a real danger. This event will last probably through Friday,\" Roth said. \"It's a critical fire danger.\"\n\nThe company cut off electricity to more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California earlier this month to try to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy and dry weather.\n\nThe bankrupt Californian power producer said it had crews, equipment, vehicles and aircraft on standby to conduct the shutoffs and subsequent inspections, repairs and power restoration.\n\nIn some areas, the company said it has reduced the scope of impact as it was able to sectionalize certain lines.\n\nIn May, state fire investigators determined that PG&E transmission lines caused the deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record in California, last year's wind-driven Camp Fire that killed 85 people in and around the town of Paradise.\n\nCal Fire likewise concluded that PG&E power lines had sparked a 2017 flurry of wildfires that swept California's wine country north of San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe company, whose handling of recent power outages has been criticized over insufficient communication with customers, sent out 48-hour advance notifications to customers on Monday afternoon informing them that it may be proactively turning power off for safety.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from the fires.\n\n(Reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru and Rich McKay in Atlanta; Editing by Alison Williams)", "description": "(Reuters) - People in more than 180,000 homes and businesses in California could find themselves in the dark as Pacific Gas & Electric again plans to shut off power in parts of 17 counties for up to two days, as a preventive measure against wildfires.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
