He jumped over Brown (19,682) and joined Jerry Rice (23,546), Brian Mitchell (23,330), Walter Payton (21,803) and Emmitt Smith (21,564) in the top 5.\n\nSproles later limped off the field a few plays after the punt return and didn\u2019t return to the contest. He exited the game with 19,684 career all-purpose yards.\n\nThe veteran tailback, listed at 5-foot-6, is playing in his 15th season in the league. The then-San Diego Chargers selected him in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft out of Kansas State. Out of that draft\u2019s group of running backs, only he and Frank Gore are still playing.\n\n.@DarrenSproles is now 5th all-time in NFL all-purpose yards! pic.twitter.com/jv5j268L9C\u2014 Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) October 6, 2019\n\nSproles, 36, is a three-time Pro Bowl choice. He is the only player in NFL history to register more than 30 receiving touchdowns (32), more than 20 rushing scores (23), at least one kickoff return touchdown (two) and at least one punt return score (seven).\n\nSproles spent six seasons with the Chargers before joining the New Orleans Saints for a three-year stint. The Saints eventually traded him to the Eagles in March 2014.\n\nThrough five games this season, Sproles has 15 carries for 59 yards and five receptions for 21 yards. He has recorded 3,545 rushing yards and 4,837 receiving yards in his career.", "description": "Oct. 6 (UPI) \u2014 Philadelphia Eagles running back Darren Sproles passed Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Tim Brown for fifth place in career", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
