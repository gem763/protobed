To the outside world, China\u2019s transformation from a poor agrarian society into one of the world\u2019s most powerful economies is nothing short of miraculous.\n\n\u201cIf you think about what China was 70 years ago, essentially a country that had fought its way through two wars and was on its knees and battered \u2013 the idea that in 70 years it would be the second biggest economy in the world\u2026 and a major global player would have seemed very unlikely indeed,\u201d said Rana Mitter, a professor of history and politics of modern China at Oxford University.\n\nBut for those who lived through these years, the pace of change has been dizzying and at times jolting. Almost no other country has experienced shifts as dramatic as China has \u2013 almost as if each generation has lived in an entirely different country.\n\nThe financial district of Pudong in Shanghai in 1987 and in 2013. The financial district of Pudong in Shanghai in 1987 and in 2013.\n\nThe Chinese who grew up in the early days of the People\u2019s Republic remember ration cards, mass hunger, and political campaigns like the Cultural Revolution, which upended the country between 1966 and 1976 and whose effects still linger today.\n\nThose in the 1980s remember a time of optimism and openness, amid a growing belief that economic reforms be accompanied by political ones, liberalising both the economy and the political system. That chapter of openness was slammed shut by the end of the decade when the Chinese military crushed student protests on 3-4 June, 1989. The nation will remember the Tiananmen Square protests on their 30th anniversary next week.\n\nIn the decade after the crackdown the Chinese leadership, faced with a crisis of legitimacy, pursued economic opening even more aggressively, opening stock markets, reforming state-owned companies, and encouraging imports and exports, all in the name of creating a \u201csocialist market economy\u201d.\n\nAs a result, Chinese millennials have grown up in relative wealth as the country became the world\u2019s manufacturer. At the same time, they have experienced even more control, censorship and surveillance, aided by advances in Chinese technology.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a generation gap, it\u2019s a \u2018generation Grand Canyon\u2019,\u201d says Maura Cunningham, a historian who specialises in modern China.\n\nChina's modern history \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nThe ruling Chinese Communist party has hailed the last seven decades as an undeniable success in nation building, a credit to the government\u2019s steady hand. While official accounts may skip over, rewrite or erase the country\u2019s darker chapters, those who lived through them cannot. The picture, according to their stories, is not so clear cut.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have chaos\u201d (1949-mid-1960s)\n\nZhang Xizhen was four years old when the People\u2019s Liberation Army entered Beijing on 31 January 1949. After a 40-day siege of the former imperial capital, the Nationalist army that controlled the city surrendered, hastening the end of a civil war that had taken up most of the last two decades.\n\nZhang\u2019s father, a lieutenant in the Nationalist or Kuomintang army, was one of those troops who yielded the city without fighting.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zhang Xizhen poses at her home in Beijing, China. Photograph: Emmanuel Wong\n\nAfter that, things changed quickly. The family, including Zhang and her five siblings, was soon moved out of their spacious house, with a living room and modern flushing toilets, and into a small two-room hutong, or alley, home.\n\nHer father made it through the political campaigns and interrogations. Because of earlier work helping an underground communist cell, he was given a piece of paper signed by Mao, acknowledging his contribution. Zhang\u2019s mother wrapped it up in oil paper and kept it in the toilet, in case his fellow Kuomintang searched their home.\n\nHe was able to find work with the CCP, and though he was never officially allowed to join the party, he could earn a living for the family, about 80 yuan a month.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zhang Xizhen (second from right) with her family in Beijing in 1949.\n\nTo Zhang, in primary school, the 1950s were a simple time. They didn\u2019t have much after the communist takeover, officially known as \u201cliberation\u201d, but the flattening of social classes and overhaul of the economy meant no one had much.\n\n\u201cWe just felt happy to have new clothing for spring festival,\u201d she says, referring to Chinese new year. \u201cMy classmates and I were happy as long as there was food and school to go to.\u201d\n\nMy mother weighed all the food before every meal Zhang Xizhen\n\nBut by the early 1960s, when Zhang was a teenager, her family was one of millions across the country struggling for enough to eat, a time known as the \u201cthree years of difficulty\u201d. It was caused by the Great Leap Forward, an unrealistic industrialisation program to put China ahead of the UK in terms of production within 15 years. As many as 45 million people starved to death by the time the program was abandoned.\n\nZhang, a singer, had joined a state dance and ensemble troupe, where her rations were slightly more. She brought them home every weekend to give to her mother.\n\n\u201cMy mother weighed all the food before every meal,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe had to plan to make sure everything lasted until the end of the month.\u201d Sometimes they would grind the core of an ear of corn, add some beancurd and make it into a cake. \u201cEverything that could be eaten was eaten,\u201d she said.\n\nZhang\u2019s mother, who ate less so her children could have more, saw her legs swell from malnutrition, a common sight across Beijing, where conditions were better than in the countryside. Zhang heard stories of people starving to death but no media reported such cases.\n\nThe \u201cthree years of difficulty\u201d were soon followed by another chaotic political movement, the Cultural Revolution, in which Zhang\u2019s father was punished and sent away to serve hard labour, despite his slip of paper signed by Mao. Only in the late 1970s did things calm down and Zhang began to travel the world with the government troupe, performing in Jamaica, Mexico, and at home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zhang Xizhen poses in Beijing in 1968\n\nToday, she lives in an apartment on the east side of the city with her husband, spending her afternoons playing pool in the building\u2019s recreation room. On the weekends, she takes care of her grandson. The years before have convinced her of the importance of stability, whatever others may say about the importance of democracy and checks and balances in government.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what is better, but right now it\u2019s stable,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t have chaos. We have been through chaotic times and all kinds of movements. We just want stability.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany things were ridiculous, even absurd, irrational\u201d (Cultural Revolution \u2013 1966-1976)\n\nZhu Xindi was getting ready to take university entrance exams in Kunming in the summer of 1966 when the Cultural Revolution \u201cfell suddenly from the sky\u201d, she says. Exams were cancelled, and universities and schools shuttered. Zhu, who had been top of her class and planned to take a degree in science and engineering, instead went to the countryside to help build \u201ca bright red new world\u201d like many other youth.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zhu Xindi, was sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution, a decade of social and political chaos kicked off by Mao in an effort to reinvigorate the socialist spirit of the country, is one of the least understood events in China\u2019s modern history.\n\nEven two decades later it is hard for Zhu to make sense of it. She spent a year farming and living among the Dai, an ethnic minority group, in a village in Yunnan province, near China\u2019s border with Myanmar. She woke before daybreak and farmed all day. Most of the young people she found herself with had never farmed before. Their initial revolutionary spirit soon faded.\n\n\u201cEveryone thought we were about to make great contributions to the nation, that we were going where the country most needed us to build a new socialist countryside,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you were actually there, it wasn\u2019t like that. We wanted to leave, but we had no choice.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zhu Xindi during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nZhu eventually left, trekking to Myanmar in the hopes of aiding communist insurgents. Turned away, she travelled throughout Yunnan, getting sick and almost going blind in one eye. \u201cFor three years, I roamed. I didn\u2019t have food to eat. I was considered mangliu,\u201d she says, referring to herself as a \u201cblind migrant\u201d.\n\nZhu\u2019s family also suffered. Red Guards, overzealous youths tasked with rooting out counterrevolutionaries, beat Zhu\u2019s little sister and forced her to shave off her hair. Zhu remembers how the family decided to take a family portrait in case they were separated.\n\nEach person snuck out of the house one by one, so as not to arouse the suspicion of their neighbours, and they met at the photo studio. Afterwards, her mother gave each of them a copy to keep. \u201cIn case we lose each other, we\u2019ll be easier to find,\u201d Zhu remembers her mother saying.\n\nI didn\u2019t have choices, and I did the best I could in the tiny space I had to make choices Zhu Xindi\n\nAfter the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976 and schools reopened, Zhu finally took the national exams she was meant to take years earlier. She went to university at the age of 30, studied medicine and became a dentist. Retired for the last 10 years, she now lives in Hangzhou.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t feel angry about the years that were taken from her. \u201cIt was very difficult and every day I didn\u2019t know if I would make it to tomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cLooking back, you can say many things were ridiculous, even absurd and irrational. But at that time, the whole country was irrational.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cFor the generation now, you have choices, and when many choices are put in front of you, you feel lost. But for us, we didn\u2019t have any choices. My whole life, I didn\u2019t have choices, and I did the best I could in the tiny space I had to make choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne step at a time\u201d \u2013 (Reform and opening 1977-1980s)\n\nChong Li, a native Beijinger, was an early adopter of the market economy. At the age of 19, he borrowed tools from his classmates, set up a shed and began fixing bikes for money. It was a year before Deng Xiaoping, who later succeeded Mao, launched reforms in 1978 that would transform the economy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The opening ceremony of Chong Li bikes fixing shop on November 1982 in Beijing, China.\n\nChong\u2019s neighbours were shocked, causing his parents to worry. The Cultural Revolution, when people had been severely punished for showing capitalist tendencies, had ended only a few years earlier. Chong still remembers a family relative who had been arrested for buying a bag of peanuts at a train station.\n\n\u201cAll private businesses and shops had been stopped, so people were scared and afraid this would happen again, and they would be beaten down again,\u201d he says of the years before reforms gained speed in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cI also struggled mentally. But whether it was real or not, I didn\u2019t think too much. I took one step at a time to see how far I would go. Like Deng said, \u2018crossing the river by feeling the stones\u2019,\u201d Chong says, quoting a famous saying of Deng\u2019s to describe China\u2019s gradual marketisation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shop owner Chong Li now runs a small business in Beijing. Photograph: Emmanuel Wong\n\nChong had little choice. The eldest of four siblings, he needed to do something to help support the family. Because he was born with cerebral palsy that affected his ability to walk, he had never been given a work assignment or a danwei, a feature of China\u2019s planned economy in the early years.\n\nAround him, the city was changing. Young people who had gone to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution were returning to cities and looking for work, putting pressure on officials to find employment for them. People began quitting their jobs to run their own businesses. In 1985, you could earn as much as 400 yuan a month on your own, compared to 50 yuan a month as a state employee, according to Chong.\n\nPeople began to open restaurants and other entrepreneurs like him began fixing things other than bicycles or torches. Households now needed help with their typewriters, radios, televisions, and refrigerators.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest As the member of Beijing People\u2019s congress, Chong Li poses with other members on 1983 in Beijing, China.\n\nDespite the changes around him, his hutong stayed quiet, without many shops. People went to work in the morning and came back by evening, keeping regular hours. \u201cPeople were warm to each other,\u201d he says. \u201cThey lived well together and weren\u2019t selfish \u2026 and they were sincere. That is what made the biggest impression on me and has become my own standard.\u201d\n\nChong still tries to maintain some of that same sense. He stopped fixing bicycles about 10 years ago after injuring his hand. Now, he runs a small shop selling goldfish and birds. He doesn\u2019t make much money and spends most of his days smoking, painting and chatting with old friends and neighbours.\n\n\u201cToday there are so many ways of transportation \u2013 with shared bikes, Didi [a taxi-hailing app]. Before, there was nothing like this. People only had their two legs. Those who had a bicycle at home were considered well off,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cA seed that keeps growing\u201d (Struggle for democracy, 1989-1990s)\n\nFor Duan Peng, from the south-western city of Chengdu, one of the experiences that marked him the most is one he did not understand at the time: the pro-democracy protests that swept China in the spring of 1989.\n\nAfter more than a decade of China\u2019s gaige kaifang, reform and opening, young Chinese were emboldened to air their opinions and grievances. In the spring of 1989, Chinese students in Beijing, Chengdu, and other cities took to the streets to mourn the death of the country\u2019s reformist leader, Hu Yaobang.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Duan Peng looks on at home in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. Photograph: Zhong Zhi/Getty Images\n\nIn Chengdu, as in Beijing, the gathering morphed into protests against government corruption and eventually calls for freedom and democratic rights. Duan, in high school at the time, understood little of the slogans the students were shouting. But he would sneak out of his home at night to join the students marching through the city.\n\n\u201cI thought it was fun, walking along the roads, with no police around. It was exciting,\u201d Duan says.\n\nOn 4 June 1989, the same day protests in Beijing had been crushed by the Chinese military, police also moved against students in Chengdu, using tear gas, knives, and electric cattle rods, according to witnesses, who said they saw soldiers stacking bodies in trucks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Duan Peng (left, front) as a child.\n\nDuan had tried to get to the protests that day but police blocked off the roads. He heard rumours of gunfire and remembers burning cars and fires in the city\u2019s public squares. He had heard that students in Beijing had been killed and soldiers burned alive. In Chengdu, the death toll would be as many as 300, according to US diplomatic cables later leaked.\n\nAfter the protests Duan finished high school, went to vocational school and became an architect at his father\u2019s urging. The country was on the cusp of an economic boom. He moved south to Shenzhen, which soon emerged as one of China\u2019s busiest economic hubs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Local residents loaded two wounded people on a rickshaw flatbed shortly after PLA soldiers opened fire on a crowd in this June 4, 1989.

In 1997, he traveled to Hong Kong and watched amid heavy rain as the Union Jack was lowered just after midnight on 1 July, marking the city\u2019s handover from British control to Chinese.\n\nToday, he lives in an apartment on the 14th floor, a far cry from his childhood home in Chengdu, surrounded by fields, with no high-rise buildings in sight. The pace of change is sometimes disorienting to him. \u201cMy generation, is the one that has been through the agricultural age, the industrial age, and now the internet age,\u201d he says.\n\nAs he thinks about his country\u2019s future, he has started to think more about the protests he witnessed in 1989. \u201cLooking back, it has had a long-lasting effect. It\u2019s like a seed that keeps growing,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Hong Kong handover ceremony on 1 July 1997. Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/REUTERS\n\n\u201cThe 1980s was China\u2019s renaissance,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, it\u2019s harder. Right now, we are in a period of transition. What we need is time for the seed to grow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a seed that needs proper soil and the right climate, then it can grow and develop. Western countries were born into democracy and freedom ... If we also want that in China we need the right environment.\n\n\u201cThe way people are governed is too strict. I don\u2019t think it will last forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to solve the problem\u201d \u2013 (2000s and beyond)\n\nXiao Chen, a student at Peking University in Beijing, represents many of the ideals his country was founded upon 70 years ago. The son of uneducated workers in China\u2019s rural interior, his primary goal is to give back to his country, help elevate the cause of workers and aid China\u2019s progress toward true socialism.\n\nHe had seen rural poverty \u2013 in his village, there was little else to do but drink and gamble. Some were taken in by pyramid schemes promising quick money. Other young people had few opportunities to get out of the cycle. So he studied, helped by relatives when his parents were not around, and managed to get into the top university in the country.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Peking University Red Building historic architecture in Beijing, China. Photograph: Sanga Park/Alamy Stock Photo\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the pain of the people around me and my own family, I was eager to change this reality. I thought there could be some simple sense of justice and responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to cultivate myself, and contribute to the country, to serve the motherland and the people.\u201d\n\nI have seen the true face of the teachers, government officials, trade unions, police, and the courts. They don\u2019t care about the workers Xiao Chen\n\nBut Chen was soon disappointed after arriving in the capital. He immediately joined the Marxist Society at the university, eager to implement the tenets he had studied for years in school. He and other members of the group helped workers on campus defend their rights, for the minimum wage and overtime pay, insurance and other protections.\n\nSoon school officials and the police tried to stop their efforts. Many of the students have been detained, grabbed in broad daylight. One was detained while on his way to attend the celebration of Mao\u2019s birthday last December. Chen, who is using an alias, says he and all the other student members are under strict surveillance.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t understand before I went to college. I was confused by the official description. I thought that the policy was to help the people, that the state protects the interests of the people.\u201d\n\nChen says he now understands. \u201cI have seen the true face of the teachers, government officials, trade unions, police, and the courts. They don\u2019t care about the workers.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to solve problems. They just want to solve the people who reflect the problem,\u201d he says.\n\nHe can\u2019t leave campus without permission. His relatives back home have had to cut off contact with him. Minders are always within 10 metres of him, monitoring him with a camera, even when he is eating at school cafeterias. When he turns on his phone, he immediately gets a phone call or a message from local security, just checking up on him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People hold banners at a demonstration in support of factory workers of Jasic Technology, outside Yanziling police station in Pingshan district, Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China August 6, 2018. Photograph: Sue-Lin Wong/Reuters\n\nChen believes there are many more young Chinese who agree with them, who have \u201cseen the inequality the country\u2019s fast economic development has created\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat we have experienced in this generation is a polarised Chinese society. When we were young, the countryside was stagnant. There was no development, and the big cities were developing fast.\u201d\n\nBut Chen is quick to stop comparisons between student activists like himself and previous generations who called for democracy and other freedoms, such as the student protesters of 1989, many of them also from Peking University.\n\n\u201cWe do not discuss 4 June because we understand the patriotism and feelings of students, but we do not support their thoughts and behaviours,\u201d he says. But he believes the student movement today is not dead.\n\n\u201cI believe that the future must belong to the Chinese working class and progressive youth. They will definitely be more and more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLillian Yang contributed additional reporting", "description": "Seven decades after Mao declared the beginning of a new era, Chinese people reflect on the dizzying and jolting changes that have forged the modern nation", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b789ac2d11112d84896bc6fb85480d09c99adb/0_308_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33b375f760c721730407b90a3fb3c892", "published_at": "2019-05-29"}
