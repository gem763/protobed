Megvii declined to comment on Goldman's statement.\n\nGoldman had thoroughly evaluated the Megvii deal before initially signing onto it using its usual due diligence process, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nKnown for its facial recognition platform Face++, Megvii will become the first Chinese AI firm to go public if the deal goes ahead.\n\nThe company provides facial recognition and other AI technology to governments and companies including Alibaba <BABA.N>, Ant Financial, Lenovo Group Ltd <0992.HK> and Huawei.\n\n\n\n\n\nMUSLIM MISTREATMENT\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday barred eight companies, as well as 20 Chinese government entities, from buying U.S. technology without U.S. government approval.\n\nThat will include high-powered computer chips made by U.S. companies such as Nvidia <NVDA.O>, Intel <INTC.O> and Qualcomm <QCOM.O>, which are considered critical for building and operating many AI systems.\n\nThe government said the entities were \"implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups\".\n\nMegvii said it \"strongly objects\" to being added to the blacklist and there were \"no grounds\" for the designation. In a statement, it said around 1% of revenues were derived from Xinjiang in 2018 and none in the six months ended June 30.\n\nIt added that a May 2019 report from Human Rights Watch (HRW) on a surveillance app in Xinjiang had implicated Megvii's Face++, but in a corrected and reissued report, HRW did not highlight Megvii's name.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. government imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslims in Xinjiang.\n\nU.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs, and members of other largely Muslim minority groups, have been detained in camps in the remote region.\n\nBeijing denies any mistreatment at the camps, which it says provide vocational training to help stamp out religious extremism and teach new work skills.\n\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who has been seeking to spotlight both the easy access that Chinese companies have been given to U.S. markets and human rights abuses in Xinjiang, said the government's move had been long overdue.\n\n\"We should continue to do more to hold Chinese government and Communist Party officials accountable for potential crimes against humanity being committed in Xinjiang,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK\"\n\nIn recent years, Chinese and some foreign investors have poured money into startups that specialize in facial and voice recognition software, as well as other surveillance equipment and software. They have been buoyed by China's plans to build a ubiquitous CCTV surveillance network.\n\nAnother company on the U.S. government's blacklist, SenseTime, is among the world's most highly valued artificial intelligence firms and counts marquee U.S. technology investors Tiger Global and Silver Lake Partners among its backers. Fidelity, the U.S. mutual fund firm, is also a SenseTime investor, along with Qualcomm.", "description": "NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc  said on Tuesday it was reviewing its involvement in Megvii Technology Ltd's planned initial public offering after the U.S. government placed the Chinese artificial intelligence firm on a human rights blacklist.
