In return, leaders of local groups said they would call off the protests.

Many of the protesters belonged to indigenous groups, who were among those hit hardest by the new measures.\n\nMoreno declared a national state of emergency just hours after protests began. Riot police and the army were sent to the capital of Quito and other cities. They used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. The protesters, in turn, threw rocks, bricks, and petrol bombs at authorities.\n\nExtinction Rebellion protests cause disruptions in London, New York and more as group demands tougher climate action\n\nThe unrest was the worst seen in the country inmore than a decade. At least seven people were killed, hundreds were wounded, and more than 1,000 people were arrested.\n\nLate last week, Moreno began communicating directly with indigenous leaders. On Sunday, he agreed to revoke Decree 883, allowing fuel prices to return to their traditionally low levels. In return, indigenous leaders called off the protests. Following the announcement, people lit fireworks in Quito in celebration.", "description": "Decree 883 revoked after worst unrest in more than a decade left at least seven people dead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/3d297172-efc1-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires122225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
