We said look, one way or another we're coming.\"\n\nTrump continued, \"[The Russians] were very cooperative, they really were good. And we said it would be a mission they'd like, too, because they hate ISIS, too.\"\n\nTrump said the Kurds provided intelligence that the US forces made use of. This comes just weeks after the president initiated a deeply controversial US retreat from northern Syria that has allowed Turkish forces to attack the US-allied Kurds. Both Democrats and Republicans have aggressively condemned the American pullout.\n\nTrump said al-Baghdadi blew himself and three children up with a suicide vest when US forces trapped him at the end of a tunnel in Idlib Province.\n\n\"Last night, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist to justice,\" Trump announced at his Sunday morning press conference. \"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.\"\n\nCritics of Trump's recent pullout insisted that Saturday's operation wouldn't have been possible if the US hadn't had a presence in Syria.\n\n\"We must keep in mind that we were able to strike Baghdadi because we had forces in the region,\" Rep. Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican of Florida and US Army veteran said. \"We must keep ISIS from returning by staying on offense.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump thanked the Russian government among others for aiding US Special Forces in an operation that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Eliza Relman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db5b532dee0194dc1295e54?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
