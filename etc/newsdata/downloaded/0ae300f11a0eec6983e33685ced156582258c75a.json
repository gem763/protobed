There is another directive at work though, and that is the conviction that Mr. Trump can flip New Mexico to the Republican way of thinking \u2014 a tall order, given that Mr. Trump\u2019s previous campaign visit to the host city sparked a near riot.\n\nHope is high for some GOP enchantment, however. There are those who say Mr. Trump and his message will work the magic in New Mexico and other states.\n\n\u201cI think he can win New Hampshire; I think Nevada is very competitive and the state has trended much more left recently, but that\u2019s a very competitive state. If you look at New Mexico, we can put it in play too,\u201d former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski tells Hill TV.\n\nMr. Lewandowski is running for the Senate seat in the Granite State and on the front line himself these days.\n\nMeanwhile, the locals are jittery in Albuquerque, and no wonder. There\u2019s history to consider.\n\nWhen then-candidate Trump arrived in the city for a campaign rally in 2016, there were multiple protests and demonstrations staged by very annoyed and determined locals. Officials are bracing for some activity this time around. All city offices and schools will be closed on Monday; \u201cpossible unrest\u201d is a factor, as is traffic gridlock and other the concerns.\n\nThere already has been at least one skirmish: Albuquerque Police quelled a confrontation between about 100 pro-Trump and anti-Trump factions on the city streets on Saturday according to KQRE, the local CBS News affiliate.\n\nThere are plans for Monday, though.\n\nThe New Mexico Democratic Party plans to assemble and have a say outside the campaign event venue, of course. A dozen progressive groups also have organized an event called \u201cNew Mexico United Against Trump: A Cultural Resistance.\u201d The participating groups include: Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, the Women\u2019s March, ProgressNow and the Native American Voters Alliance.\n\n\u201cDemonstrators who participated in previous Trump protests say they have discussed blocking traffic and lying down on highways,\u201d writes Russell Contreras, an Associated Press correspondent.\n\n\u201cActivist Javier Benavidez said many are angry that Trump is holding his rally in a state with the highest percentage of Hispanic residents on Sept. 16 \u2014 Mexican Independence Day,\u201d Mr. Contreras noted.\n\nBIDEN CAMPAIGN RESURRECTS \u2018BFD\u2019\n\nSome may recall that on March 23, 2010, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden were shaking hands and celebrating the arrival of Obamacare. A nearby hot microphone picked up Mr. Biden\u2019s commentary on the moment, which included the longer, more emphatic form of the acronym \u201cBFD.\u201d\n\nWell, hey, why not reference said acronym for Mr. Biden\u2019s current campaign for president?\n\nIndeed, his campaign has activated the acronym in a new fundraiser, and the public outreach tells all:\n\n\u201cWithout further ado, we introduce THE BFD \u2014 The Biden Fundraising Dashboard. Here you can access your personal fundraising link, have your friends and family use this link for their donations, and track how many donations you\u2019ve been able to collect in your network,\u201d the outreach advises Biden fans.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more: Vice President Biden is so excited about this new grassroots tool that he\u2019ll be calling some of the supporters that recruit five or more donations on their personal links!\u201d\n\nEnough said.\n\nBILL MAHER\u2019S IDEAL DEMOCRAT\n\nForget the data-driven strategies of high-end political consultants. Longtime observer and gadfly Bill Maher has offered a description of the Democratic hopeful who will win the White House.\n\nOr something like that.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t vote on policy. I don\u2019t think a lot of them know a lot of the policy. I think they look for strength versus weakness and what they perceive as strength. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m always looking for in the Democrat. That\u2019s what I think they like about Trump. They see him as strong because he is blustery and he never backs down and he looks like Henry VIII, and he acts like it. So for me, a Democrat who can project that I think is our best bet,\u201d Mr. Maher tells MSNBC.\n\nWHAT YOUNG REPUBLICANS MUST FACE\n\nA survey of 1,000 Republican and Republican-leaning college students reveals that almost three-fourths of them have withheld their political views in class for fear of academic repercussions, says The College Fix, a news organization that conducted the survey of self-identified GOP college students in late August.\n\nThe question: \u201cHave you ever withheld your political views in class for fear that your grades would suffer?\u201d\n\nThe findings: 73% of students who identity as \u201cstrong Republican\u201d reported that they had, while 71% of students who identify as \u201cweak Republican\u201d agreed.\n\n\u201cEven students who identify as Republican-leaning independents indicated they\u2019ve kept quiet: 70% reported they have withheld their political views to protect their grades,\u201d the poll analysis noted.\n\n\u201cI am conservative. I would be crucified. I heard enough horror stories from friends and family to keep my mouth shut and avoid politics in class if at all possible,\u201d one student told the pollster.\n\n\u201cI actually got yelled at by a professor for my views on gun control,\u201d another said.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 83% of Americans blame mass shootings on failure of mental health system to identify dangerous individuals; 85% of Republicans and 80% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 79% blame the spread of extremist viewpoints on the internet; 69% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 65% blame \u201ceasy access to guns\u201d; 46% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 77% blame drug use; 73% of Republicans and 57% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 58% blame violence in movies, video games and music lyrics; 53% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 44% blame use of inflammatory language by politicians and commentators; 39% of Republicans and 80% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: A Gallup poll of 2,291 U.S. adults and released Friday.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
