Her remarks suggest Berlin now harbors serious doubts that the EU and the U.K. can work together as close partners after Brexit \u2014 despite both sides having previously insisted that is their intention.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the German leader outlined a wide range of areas \u2014 including trade, climate policy and artificial intelligence \u2014 in which Berlin and Paris aim to cooperate more closely. EU officials have repeatedly insisted that the U.K. must commit to a level-playing field on issues like state aid or the EU would refuse to eliminate tariffs under a future EU-U.K. trade deal.\n\n\"We will do all this in the knowledge that with the departure of Great Britain, a potential competitor will of course emerge for us. That is to say, in addition to China and the United States of America, there will be Great Britain as well,\" Merkel said.\n\n\"Here Europe must show what the European Union can achieve: That means we must work faster, work more consistently, and the new [European] Commission with Ursula von der Leyen at its head should also become operational as quickly as possible.\"\n\nVon der Leyen's Commission is almost certain not to be ready to take office as scheduled on November 1 after three members of her team were rejected by the European Parliament \u2014 including France's nominee, Sylvie Goulard.\n\nIn his remarks to reporters, Macron took another shot at the European Parliament and its leading political groups, whom he has sought to blame for the failure of his nominee.\n\n\u201cI want us, with Chancellor Merkel and President-designate of the Commission, Mrs. von der Leyen, to be able to build a strong Commission based on a solid majority in the European Parliament that we all have the responsibility of building,\" Macron said.\n\n\"In this particular moment, Europe cannot allow itself the luxury of vain quarrels and small fights or to add internal crisis to the tensions of the world.\"\n\nFrench officials have blamed Goulard's defeat on political discord within Merkel's coalition in Germany and on the European People's Party (EPP), which refused to back the French nominee.\n\nThey have suggested Goulard was rejected in revenge for Macron's sinking of the so-called Spitzenkandidat system, which could have made German politician Manfred Weber, the leader of the EPP group in the European Parliament, the next Commission president.\n\nVon der Leyen will be in Paris on Monday to meet with Macron.\n\nHans von der Burchard contributed reporting.", "description": "German chancellor classes Britain alongside China and US.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175594109-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
