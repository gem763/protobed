A blind customer of Domino\u2019s was unable to use the app to order a pizza, leading to the lawsuit and a ruling in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the mobile app must be made accessible.\n\nAccording to Chris Ake, this could be \u201cmonumental\u201d in the restaurant industry. Ake is the founder of Grand Apps, which specializes in mobile apps for the restaurant industry among other business offerings.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a more digitally-connected world run by software and we need to look at resetting standards for compliance and regulations, such as being ADA compliant,\u201d Ake told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cI think restaurants need to be on high alert. There have been significantly increasing ADA compliant lawsuits for websites and mobile apps since 2017. Remember when people needed a mobile-first strategy? Well, they should focus on an ADA-compliant strategy and put that into their budgets because as we have seen with Domino's, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor they were not compliant which sets the precedent. So, if restaurants are not compliant, they're at a great risk.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released on their website, Domino\u2019s postured that it has \u201calready developed an accessible website and app.\u201d The company then made the case that a national standard in accordance with ADA guidelines is necessary to ensure compliance.\n\n\u201cAlthough Domino\u2019s is disappointed that the Supreme Court will not review this case, we look forward to presenting our case at the trial court. We also remain steadfast in our belief in the need for federal standards for everyone to follow in making their websites and mobile apps accessible,\u201d Domino\u2019s said in a statement.\n\n\u201cCreating a nation-wide standard will eliminate the tsunami of website accessibility litigation that has been filed by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers exploiting the absence of a standard for their own benefit, and chart a common path for both businesses and non-profit institutions to follow in meeting the accessibility needs of the disabled community.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCurrently, the laws governing ADA compliance with mobile apps is still murky, says Shawn Stevens, a food industry lawyer and founder of Food Industry Counsel LLC, the only law firm in the U.S. that represents the food industry exclusively. On the fallout from the Domino\u2019s decision and where the industry will move when it comes to mobile apps, Stevens said the case \u201ccreates substantial uncertainty for the restaurant industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe laws are quite vague and open for broad interpretation. I view mobile apps as only one of many ways to access a restaurant\u2019s product offerings,\u201d Stevens told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cSo long as other means exist, there should be no claim. It really becomes more of a competitive edge issue \u2013 i.e., who has the best apps accessible to the most people. With that said, there are countless plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers targeting the food industry looking for ways to profit by turning that vagueness into large-scale lawsuits and settlements.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The future of restaurant mobile apps is cloudy as the lack of ADA guidelines is leaving the industry open to lawsuits.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/AP19168560665953.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
