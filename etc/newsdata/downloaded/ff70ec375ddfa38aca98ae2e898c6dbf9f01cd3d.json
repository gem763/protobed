He had only used it to livestream once before.\n\nTwitch said that five people watched an initial live version of the shooting, which broadcast footage from the suspect\u2019s head-mounted camera. The stream showed the suspect trying to force his way into the synagogue packed with worshippers while shooting and throwing what one witness described as \u201cMolotov cocktails\u201d.\n\nAlerted by the gunfire, they quickly barricaded the doors. The attacker then turns his attention to the streets, shooting dead a woman who was passing by a nearby Jewish cemetery. He continued to a kebab shop nearby, where he shot one man dead.\n\nDuring the 35-minute stream, the suspected far-right fanatic can be heard saying in English: \u201cMy name is Anon and I think the holocaust never happened...feminism is the cause of declining birth rates in the West which acts as a scapegoat for mass immigration, and the root of all these problems is the Jew.\u201d\n\nOnce the broadcast ended, it automatically uploaded a version that was viewed by 2,200 people in the 30 minutes it took Twitch to shut it down.\n\nA Twitch spokesman said that the video had been shared in a \"coordinated\" manner on other messaging services. Typically, social networks like Twitch, YouTube and Facebook will recommend videos when they begin to surge in popularity. Twitch said this was not the case. It said that the Halle shooting copy was taken down by a moderator after a viewer reported it through its flagging system.", "description": "Amazon-owned Twitch has confirmed that around 2,200 people used the popular video-sharing website to watch a deadly shooting outside a synagogue in Halle, Germany on Wednesday morning, before it was taken offline.", "authors": ["Margi Murphy", "Us Technology Reporter", "Tom Hoggins", "Harry De Quetteville"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212509239-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
