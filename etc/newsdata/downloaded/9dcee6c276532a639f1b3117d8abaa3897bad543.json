I prefer the clear one on the Aura Glow Note 10 Plus, which is the one I reviewed, since the clear case lets the cool rainbow colors of the phone shine through while also eliminating the fingerprints that the naked phone attracts.\n\nThe cases incorporate the Unequal technology with injected impact gel to help absorb and dissipate impact shocks. The Ace Pro is available now for just $24.46, regularly $34.95, which is a great deal for such a protective case.\n\nThe UltraTough screen protector is made with self-healing urethane film to prevent scratches from your display. It is not a tempered glass protector that acts as a sacrificial anode for drops so be careful with your phone and consider an Ace Pro case. This protector is available now for just $13.96, regularly $19.95.", "description": "A couple new cases and a self-healing screen protector are now available from BodyGuardz.
