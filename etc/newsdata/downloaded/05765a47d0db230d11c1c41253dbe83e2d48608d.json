REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n\nBut the response was more muted at an annual conference of religious conservatives on Friday in Washington, where some Christian activists were concerned about the Syria move but willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\u201cI would have done things differently, but I don\u2019t have all the information that went into the decision,\u201d Jeffrey Morgan, co-founder of a pro-family group called Americans Against No-Fault Divorce, said at the Values Voter Summit.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time when we abandon friends who have stuck their necks out for us,\u201d he said of the Kurds, close U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State militants who are now under attack from Turkey in Syria. \u201cBut would I abandon the president over Syria? No way.\u201d\n\nWilliam Murray, chairman of the Religious Freedom Coalition, a group that runs programs to assist Christians in Africa and the Middle East, including Syria, said he did not believe Kurds were protective of Christians in the region, but the withdrawal had made the area unstable.\n\n\u201cAny time you create a situation where bullets and bombs are flying, you are going to endanger people on the ground,\u201d he said.\n\nEvangelicals have been among Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters through years of scandal and controversy, and the criticism from influential leaders has been a rare crack in their overwhelming support for the president as he heads into a congressional impeachment battle and a tough 2020 re-election fight.\n\nPat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, said after Trump announced the withdrawal that he was \u201cin great danger of losing the mandate of Heaven.\u201d\n\nFranklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, asked people to pray for Trump to reconsider, saying \u201cthousands of lives hang in the balance.\u201d\n\nTrump won 81% of the vote from white evangelical Christians in the 2016 election, which came just weeks after a decade-old Access Hollywood video surfaced showing him bragging about kissing and grabbing women because \u201cwhen you are a star, they let you do it.\u201d\n\nEvangelicals have stuck with Trump since, through sex scandals like his alleged payments to hush up an affair with a porn star, and controversies like the investigation into Russian election meddling. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll from mid-September, 70% of white evangelicals approve of Trump\u2019s job performance.\n\nAt the conference, which will conclude with a speech by Trump on Saturday night, the president drew repeated cheers for appointing conservative, anti-abortion judges, protecting religious liberties and battling liberals.\n\nSpeakers condemned the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into whether Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to dig up dirt on political rival Joe Biden, the former U.S. vice president who is seeking the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time we send Adam Schiff home instead of the president of the United States,\u201d conservative Republican U.S. Representative Mark Meadows told the cheering crowd, making a reference to one of the Democratic lawmakers leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAttendees said Trump was a sympathetic leader besieged by Democrats determined to bring him down.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a perfect man, but he represents more of my moral values than those who seem to hate him,\u201d said Tim Chafins, a healthcare worker in Akron, Ohio. \u201cWhat I see happening in Washington has nothing to do with Ukraine, Russia or China. It\u2019s all politics.\u201d\n\nTim Throckmorton, Midwest director of ministry for the Family Research Council, one of the sponsors of the conference, said that knowing Trump\u2019s heart, \u201cI\u2019m sure he feels he is doing the right thing in Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope the Christians in Syria are safe,\u201d he added.", "description": "Prominent evangelical leaders have sharply criticized U.S. President Donald Trump over his decision to pull American military forces out of Syria, saying he was endangering tens of thousands of Christians in the Muslim-dominated region.", "authors": ["John Whitesides", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439857248&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A26P", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
