I'm not out of my element inside any ring,' Fury said.\n\n'And do you know the best thing about it, I'm going to prove that at the Crown Jewel when the heavyweight champion of the world steps into your ring, you're going to be looking up off your backside because I'm going to knock you out.'\n\nThe heavyweight boxer vowed to knock Strowman out when the two meet at Crown Jewel\n\nStrowman reacted angrily, smashing a table in half before tensing his muscles in Fury's face\n\nStrowman responded angrily, rising from his chair to look Fury in the eyes before breaking the table with his fists.\n\nFury then pretended to struggle to snap a pen before walking off laughing.\n\nThe self-styled Gypsy King's venture into WWE is expected to pocket him in the region of \u00a312million and could scupper his planned rematch against Deontay Wilder, as Sportsmail revealed this week.\n\nHis promoter Frank Warren admitted he was left in the dark by Fury and is not best pleased with his decision to fight Strowman.\n\nThe Gypsy King responded tongue-in-cheek as he pretended to struggle to snap a pen\n\nFury refused to be goaded into an altercation and walked off laughing afterwards\n\nWarren told talkSPORT: 'What can you say?
