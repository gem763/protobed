He then told Mason to ask Niinist\u00f6 a question, but another reporter interrupted to press Trump about Biden.\n\n\u201cLook, Biden and his son are stone cold crooked,\u201d Trump claimed. \u201cYou know it and so do we.\u201d\n\nTrump has accused then-Vice President Biden of calling for the removal of a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine for the purpose of impeding an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company upon whose board Hunter Biden was serving. Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing.\n\nMason pushed Trump again: \u201cBut the question, sir, was what did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son Hunter?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d Trump asked after a few moments of silence. \u201cHaven\u2019t you finished with me? Listen, we have the president of Finland. Ask him a question.\u201d\n\nBut Mason continued to press Trump to answer the question, drawing heated pushback from the president.\n\n\u201cAsk him a question,\u201d Trump said, motioning to Niinist\u00f6. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude. ... I\u2019ve answered everything. It\u2019s a whole hoax. And you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Reuters White House Correspondent Jeff Mason presses President Trump for an answer about the Ukraine call, as the president pushes Mason to question the Finnish president instead. pic.twitter.com/hj0evHxQyv \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) October 2, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky is the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official in August, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump last week.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed his conversation with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and that he\u2019s the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d orchestrated by Democrats.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before a congressional committee last week that he believes the whistleblower, who has not been identified publicly, \u201cacted in good faith\u201d and \u201cfollowed the law\u201d when filing the complaint.\n\nThe whirlwind press conference Wednesday was eyebrow-raising from the start, with Niinist\u00f6 imploring Trump to keep American democracy alive.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you have here a great democracy. Keep it going on,\u201d the Finnish president told Trump, who raised his eyebrows and nodded in response.\n\nNiinist\u00f6 also pushed for global action on climate change and urged Trump to work with world leaders on trade.\n\nAsked to elaborate on his democracy comments, Niinist\u00f6 said, \u201cI just wanted to tell him that I\u2019m impressed with what the American people have gained during these decades, these 100 or so years. ...
