Now authorities believe Thomas Bruce, (right) may be the real killer\n\nSuzanne Marie Collins (above), a 19-year-old Marine who left her barracks for a jog and never returned in 1985, was found in a Tennessee park raped, beaten and stabbed with a sharpened tree branch, and strangled to death, police say\n\nAlley, a 29-year-old repairman at the time, who was alcoholic and addicted to drugs, confessed to the murder after cops fed him breakfast and bought him a pack of cigarettes, reports the Washington Post.\n\nA jury delivered a guilty verdict in less than three hours, and despite changing his story and possible DNA evidence that could have exonerated him, Alley was forced to die by lethal injection at the age of 51 in 2006.\n\nThen came the arrest of Thomas Bruce in Missouri in November 2018.\n\nCops said the 54-year-old, former Missouri pastor posed as a customer at a Catholic Supply store in the suburbs of St. Louis, returned armed with a gun, forced two women into sex acts, and killed a third.\n\nHe was arrested and faces 17-felony charges for the grisly attack and is currently awaiting trial.\n\nAt the time of Bruce's arrest, police were stunned that he had no prior criminal record. Given the horrific nature of his alleged sexual assaults and murder, took a closer look at the man.\n\nThat's when they suspected he may be linked to other crimes and came across a 77-year-old woman, who recognized his face in media reports, and said that before the Catholic supply store incident he had forced his way into her home, raped her and stole her cell phone.\n\nHe has plead not guilty to both charges.\n\nAuthorities in their investigation of Bruce also made what they believed could be major break in the Collins case. They said they had learned Bruce was enrolled in the same avionics school Collins had attended in Memphis, not far from where her body was found after she was murdered.\n\nBarry Scheck (above, right) co-founder of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit group that helps to exonerate people who are wrongly convicted, through the use of DNA evidence, has been trying to clear Alley's name since before his execution\n\nApril Alley (pictured above), who is the daughter of Sedley Adley, has filed a petition with the courts she hopes will allow the DNA testing that could exonerate her now deceased dad\n\nCops contacted Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit group that helps to exonerate people who are wrongly convicted, through the use of DNA evidence, and which had unsuccessfully tried to help Alley.\n\n'They were saying to us, there's a possibility that he is the serial killer that you had argued might be discovered by a DNA test all those years ago,' Scheck said.\n\nLawyers for the Innocence Project had long-argued that a potential piece of key evidence -- a pair of men's red underwear discovered at the scene where Collins was slain -- should have been submitted for testing to know for sure Alley was the killer.\n\nTennessee prosecutors, however, have argued that there were other factors proving Alley was the killer, and that DNA alone would not have been enough to prove his innocence.\n\nHis execution came after Alley took back his confession, and experts had come to the conclusion that he had been coerced.\n\nThere also had been no physical evidence linking him to the murder, and his recollection of the attack on Collins didn't match up to autopsy results and findings from the crime scene, reports the Post.\n\nInnocence Project lawyers warned against putting Alley to death penalty without the DNA testing, and that if executed, the real murderer would still be on the loose.\n\nAfter the execution, attorneys for the project petitioned the courts to have the DNA tested on behalf of Alley's daughter. She said she hoped to get closure during a court hearing on Monday.\n\nA judge is expected to rule on her request in November.", "description": "Sedley Alley was put to death by the state of Tennessee for the 1985 murder of Suzanne Marine Collins.
