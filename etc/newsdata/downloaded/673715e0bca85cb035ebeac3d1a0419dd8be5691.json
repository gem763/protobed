(AP) - The Kentucky Department for Public Health says more than a third of students haven\u2019t received the mandated Hepatitis A vaccination.\n\nThe Lexington Herald-Leader reports immunization rates released Tuesday show about 65% of the 209,904 mandated students have received the shot. The state\u2019s target compliance rate is 85%.\n\nResults show seniors had the lowest compliance rate at 46% and kindergartners had the highest with 84.3%.\n\nUniversity of Kentucky infectious disease pediatrician Dr. Sean McTigue says the compliance lag is because of general hesitancy regarding vaccines and the need for two shots. McTigue believes it\u2019ll take \u201cat least two years\u201d to get everyone onboard.\n\nKentucky experienced a Hepatitis A outbreak in 2017, prompting the mandated vaccination. As of September, the health department says 4,943 people are infected and 61 people have died.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Kentucky Department for Public Health says more than a third of students haven't received the mandated Hepatitis A vaccination.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
