Rescue workers are racing through flooded terrain looking for survivors and the bodies of victims.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has dispatched nine cutters from Key West and has been deploying helicopters, pre-staged in the Bahamas as Dorian approached, to transport the injured to medical facilities in Nassau \u2014 the capital, on the island of New Providence \u2014 south of the devastation. The British Royal Navy, numerous aid groups, and first responders from Fairfax County, Va., and Los Angeles have joined, or are in the process of joining, the Bahamians\u2019 rescue and relief efforts.\n\nDorian weakened for much of Wednesday, but the eye became more organized as the day wore on, and the top winds bumped up again. By late evening, Dorian strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane, with 115 mph sustained winds in its eyewall.\n\nThe hurricane continued to edge dangerously close to shore as it traced an improbable arc parallel to the southeastern coast of the United States. The National Hurricane Center warned that Dorian could make landfall in the Carolinas on Thursday before spinning away into the North Atlantic. Even if the core of the storm stays offshore, it could unleash \u201cdestructive winds, flooding rains, and life-threatening storm surges,\u201d according to the Hurricane Center.\n\nThe most likely place for Dorian to crash ashore, given the shape of the coastline, would be North Carolina\u2019s fragile Outer Banks. In the meantime, the storm surge will be considerable in coastal cities such as Savannah, Ga., Charleston and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, and Wilmington, just over the North Carolina border.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s certain is that Dorian is now a more moderate version of the storm that hit the northwest Bahamas on Sunday.\n\nA storm surge as high as a two-story building, with waves on top of that, effectively obliterated the city of Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco.\n\n\u201cAn absolute catastrophe. SEND HELP TO ABACO ISLANDS,\u201d tweeted storm chaser Josh Morgerman after riding out the storm in Marsh Harbour, where he said the winds pounded his concrete building \u201cwith the force of a thousand sledgehammers.\u201d\n\nFamily members have gathered at the helicopter terminal of Nassau\u2019s international airport awaiting evacuees from the Abacos. Ralanda McKinney, a 25-year-old Abacos transplant living in Nassau, was waiting for news of her parents. Their neighbor, who was evacuated with severe injuries, told McKinney that he had seen her parents at a shelter that was running out of food.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about possessions,\u201d McKinney said. \u201cI just want to see their faces.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe storm ripped apart a house on Great Abaco.

Rayven Bootle, 18, was waiting for word from her mother, grandmother and others in the Abacos community of Treasure Cay. She was frustrated that the government was not letting people in Nassau carry donated relief supplies to the Abacos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been days. Dorian is gone,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on, we need to get in.\u201d\n\nThe names of more than 5,500 people have been posted on DorianPeopleSearch.com, a site set up to connect loved ones amid the chaos. It\u2019s unclear how many are missing or just haven\u2019t been able to make contact.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard officials preparing to dock in Miami Beach on Wednesday said they expected to load up on plastic tarps for shelters \u2014 one of the most in-demand items in the Bahamas \u2014 before delivering those and other supplies to Nassau on Thursday. U.S. officials said they are eager to head to the islands.\n\n\u201cThis is not a short-term recovery,\u201d said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Kristopher Ensley, captain of the Paul Clark, one of nine cutters ordered to the Bahamas to provide disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. \u201cFor now, they need food, they need shelter, they need medical care.\u201d\n\nThe Coast Guard was still fielding emergency rescue requests from the Bahamian government; people in the United States attempting to check on relatives and friends should call the State Department\u2019s Office of Overseas Citizens Services at 888-407-4747.\n\nA major challenge for the cutters is that the waters around the islands are full of debris, sunken boats and other hazards.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really know what to expect,\u201d said Ardy Effendi, executive officer of the Paul Clark. \u201cWe can\u2019t just push through a lot of debris.\u201d\n\nTheo Neilly, consul general for the Bahamas in Washington, said the scale of the destruction is unprecedented.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen a hurricane of this kind in the country ever before,\u201d Neilly said. He noted that Grand Bahama is the second-most-populated island in the chain, and Great Abaco is the third-most \u2014 \u201cand a large portion of the economy as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe aftermath on Great Abaco.

Never had a storm so powerful become stationary for so long over an inhabited place. Dorian\u2019s murderous 40-hour stall over Grand Bahama on Sunday and Monday is something weather experts had not seen.\n\n\u201cGrand Bahama Island may have just endured the longest siege of violent, destructive weather ever observed,\u201d reported The Washington Post\u2019s Capital Weather Gang. By comparison, Hurricane Michael, which ripped up the Florida Panhandle town of Mexico Beach in October, was a fast-moving storm in which the wind and 16-foot storm surge did their damage over a couple of hours. Dorian was stronger, with a storm surge possibly as high as 23 feet \u2014 and it barely budged for a day and a half.\n\nThe White House said President Trump spoke Wednesday with Prime Minister Hubert Minnis of the Bahamas, offering condolences and promising support in the disaster response.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the president tweeted that he was signing an emergency declaration for North Carolina at the request of Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.), whom Trump is supporting in the Republican primary there. But the declaration was actually requested by North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat.\n\nDuring a hurricane briefing with officials in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, Trump displayed what appeared to be a doctored map of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s projected track as it approached Florida. The map showed a white line encircling the area of Dorian\u2019s most likely path \u2014 often called the cone of uncertainty \u2014 but there also was a mysterious black loop that extended the track into Alabama. Trump had been sharply criticized on Sunday for a tweet in which he claimed, incorrectly, that Alabama was among the states that would be hit \u201charder than anticipated\u201d by the storm.\n\nAs reporters pressed him for answers later Wednesday, Trump said he had been told there was a \u201c95 percent\u201d probability that Alabama would be hit by the hurricane. He denied any knowledge of whether anyone had drawn on the map, saying only: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAlabama is safe, as is Florida, now that Dorian has passed. As the storm churned north of Florida\u2019s coast, it left many Sunshine State residents grumbling about the protracted inconvenience of a week\u2019s worth of often dire warnings and mandatory evacuations.\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t nothing coming this way,\u201d said Jerome Owens, 57, who was fishing in the St. John\u2019s River in Jacksonville, using a croaker as bait in hopes of catching a red fish. \u201cIt\u2019s high tide, and the water is supposed to be coming over, but all we got is some rain showers.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, my neighbor is home cutting his lawn right now,\u201d added Gary Williams, 66. \u201cAnd if you go to the other side of town, you can probably find people having barbecues in their front lawn.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe storm eroded beaches and scattered debris in St. Augustine, Fla., where the A1A coastal route in Vilano Beach was closed. (Maria Alejandra Cardona/Reuters)\n\nAs dolphins fed in the river, Williams and Owens said local officials had overreacted by ordering the evacuation of a quarter-million residents in Jacksonville, which has shown a propensity to flood.\n\n\u201cThey made too big a deal about this storm, and they should have known when it just stopped and sat over the Bahamas that it wasn\u2019t going to make it here to be anything like Irma,\u201d said Owens, referring to the hurricane that inundated nearly 1,000 properties here in 2017.\n\nSome residents in Jacksonville Beach, a barrier island along the Atlantic Ocean, also questioned city leaders\u2019 decision to order a broad evacuation. But Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry (R) strongly defended the move, noting it takes 48 hours to successfully evacuate so many people.\n\n\u201cThis is my third storm in four years,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe know what we are doing.\u201d\n\nIn Daytona Beach, Fla., bridges that had been shut down because of high wind on Tuesday night reopened earlier than expected Wednesday morning. Few cars were on the roads, and few businesses were open.\n\n\u201cTo say we dodged a bullet from the storm is an understatement, obviously we dodged a missile,\u201d Volusia County Manager George Recktenwald said.\n\nEileen Keenan, who chose to stay in her house a block from the beach, said her only complaint was that the coffee shop near her was closed for the day.\n\n\u201cWe can joke about it and be like \u2018ugh,\u2019 but you have to be grateful that nothing happened and we were not the Bahamas,\u201d said Keenan, 53. \u201cGood god, help those poor people.\u201d\n\nThe Carolinas are now facing their Dorian moment. Some locations could see as much as five to eight feet of storm-surge flooding, which will come on top of already unusually high tides.\n\nRandy Webster, head of the Horry County Emergency Management agency in Myrtle Beach, S.C., was dismayed that only about 15 percent of residents complied with an evacuation order for part of the county.\n\n\u201cYour decision to stay and not evacuate,\u201d Webster said, \u201cmeans you may be by yourself for a very long time.\u201d\n\nAs the skies darkened Wednesday, Horry Sheriff Phillip Thompson told those who stayed: \u201cBe calm, hunker down. We\u2019ll get past it; we\u2019ve been here before.\u201d\n\n\n\nA man walks into a Dollar General on Wednesday in Carolina Beach, N.C., just south of Wilmington. (Elijah Nouvelage/For The Washington Post)\n\nOfficials in Wilmington, N.C., urged residents to be off the streets by 8 p.m. The city is no stranger to hurricanes: Last September, slow-moving Florence drenched the Wilmington area, causing major flooding on the Cape Fear River. Officials predicted this storm won\u2019t be as bad but asked residents to take it seriously.\n\nBeach communities have been under an evacuation order since 8 a.m. Wednesday. Residents of low-lying areas are urged, but not ordered, to move to shelter on higher ground. A storm surge of four to seven feet is expected.\n\nDuke Energy, the largest utility provider in the Southeast outside of Florida, predicts 700,000 people will have power outages in the eastern Carolinas, some possibly for several days, as Dorian approaches. The company said in a news release that more than 9,000 utility workers are in the Carolinas to assist with power restoration.\n\nTo the south, in Charleston, flooding also is likely. The region has become more vulnerable because of rising sea levels and coastal development. Since 1996, about 25 percent of the land and wetlands around the Church Creek basin in West Ashley, a suburban Charleston subdivision, have been filled, according to Andrew Wunderley of Charleston Waterkeeper, a nonprofit environmental watchdog group.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about flooding and hurricanes, the threat to property, life and people\u2019s well-being is obviously very important and top of mind, but what gets overlooked is the ecological damage,\u201d he said. \u201cFloodwater is about the dirtiest water you can conjure up, full of oil and grease, herbicides and pesticides, bacteria and pathogens, and all sorts of nastiness, and when it drains away after the visceral event is over, it can still take years for estuaries and waterways to recover.\u201d\n\nDorian\u2019s path is near the fishing grounds of commercial fisherman Mark Marhefka. The more intense the storm, the more damage to the ocean floor and marine habitat, he said. \u201cThe fish will either bunch up and bite like crazy, or they\u2019ll be all stirred up and not want to bite,\u201d said Marhefka, of Charleston. Typically, the fishing on the backside of a hurricane is some of his best. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice groundswell and a lot of dancing action on the bait.\u201d\n\nIf the electricity on shore is still out, he\u2019ll have to drag his generator along to power his electric scale. \u201cGot to be able to weigh the catch and get the fish to my restaurants,\u201d he said.\n\nBechir Slama, manager of the IHOP restaurant in Bluffton, S.C., stayed open for breakfast Wednesday but closed at 1 p.m. so his employees could return home to ride out the storm.\n\n\u201cThey want to work,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is hurricane season; they always make good money in the hurricane season. Tips are always better.\u201d\n\nSacchetti reported from aboard the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Paul Clark in the Atlantic Ocean, Craig from Jacksonville, Achenbach from Washington.
