A corner was initially cleared by Sassuolo but Inter attacked again and Martinez cut inside on the left-hand side of the box and curled a shot into the bottom corner.\n\nMartinez came close to doubling Inter's lead shortly afterwards but saw a volley fly just wide after Roberto Gagliardini picked him out behind the Sassuolo defence.\n\nSassuolo supporters pay tribute to late club owner Giorgio Squinzi before kick-off\n\nA parachutist landed on the field at the Stadio Citta del Tricolore during first-half of the match\n\nOne of the Inter players watched on in bemusement as the parachutist interrupts the game\n\nThe intruder from the skies is led off the field by stewards after his misjudged landing\n\nMatch facts Sassuolo (4-3-1-2): Consigli; Muldur (Toljan 76), Marlon, Peluso, Tripaldelli; Duncan, Magnanelli, Obiang (Boga 52); Traore (Duricic 66); Berardi, Capulo Substitutes not used: Defrel, Raspadori, Romagna, Ghion, Turati, Russo, Locatelli, Kyriakopoulos Manager: Roberto De Zerbi Scorers: Berardi 16; Duricic 74; Boga 81 Booked: Obiang, Duncan, Magnanelli, Muldur Inter Milan (3-5-2): Handanovic; Skrinar, De Vrij, Bastoni; Candreva (Lazaro 73), Gagliardini, Brozovic, Barella, Biraghi; Lukaku (Vecino 90), Martinez (Politano 72) Substitutes not used: Godin, Ranocchia, Asamoah, Valero, Dimarco, Padelli, Esposito, Berni Manager: Antonio Conte Scorers: Martinez 2, 71 pen; Lukaku 38, 45 pen Booked: De Vrij, Lazaro, Bastoni\n\nIt proved costly as the hosts equalised just after the quarter-hour thanks to a superb finish by Berardi, who drilled past Samir Handanovic after bursting beyond Cristiano Biraghi.\n\nBoth teams saw goals disallowed before Inter restored their advantage through Lukaku, the former Manchester United striker turning inside the Sassuolo box before powering into the bottom corner.\n\nThat was his fourth Serie A goal and No 5 wasn't long in arriving when Martinez was dragged to the ground by Marlon for a penalty that saw Lukaku sent keeper Andrea Consigli the wrong way.\n\nBefore Lukaku, the last Inter player to score four or more in his first four away Serie A games was Diego Milito in November 2009 - the season in which Milito led Inter to the Champions League title.\n\nThe bizarre interruption by a parachutist who appeared to have miscalculated his landing occurred two minutes before half-time with the helmeted airman escorted off by security.\n\nInter further strengthened their grip 20 minutes from time when Nicolo Barella was brought down in the box by Filip Duricic.\n\nLukaku passed up the opportunity of a hat-trick and allowed Martinez to convert.\n\nClearly believing that victory was sealed, Inter were guilty of relaxing though Duricic's finish through the legs of various Inter defenders and into the bottom corner on 74 minutes looked like a consolation.\n\nBut things got very interesting nine minutes from the end when Boga beat three Inter defenders before cutting inside from the left and picking out the far corner.\n\nInter were forced to withstand late pressure with Sassuolo sending keeper Consigli forward for a stoppage time corner but they held out to close the gap on Juve.\n\nLautaro Martinez had opened the scoring for high-flying Inter in just the second minute\n\nMartinez celebrates after scoring the fourth goal before Sassuolo fought back late on\n\nSassuolo equalised through Domenico Berardi after 16 minutes having fallen behind early on\n\nLukaku congratulates Lautaro on converting a penalty for Inter's fourth of the afternoon\n\nBut Sassuolo rallied strongly late on and former Chelsea player Jeremie Boga scored for 4-3", "description": "Romelu Lukaku scored twice as Inter Milan survived a nervy finale in a seven-goal thriller at Sassuolo to keep in touch with Serie A leaders Juventus.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/13/19955690-0-image-a-55_1571575131243.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
