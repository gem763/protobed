(Labor has since returned that money to the NSW Electoral Commission.)\n\nLabor's 2015 fundraising dinner at The Eight restaurant in Chinatown. Pictured are Ernest Wong, second from left; Bill Shorten, third from left; Huang Xiangmo, second from right; and Luke Foley, far right. Supplied\n\nLabor received another $750,000 from companies controlled by three Australian-Chinese businessman \u2013 Shao Wei Chen, Luo Chuangxiong and Wencheng Guo \u2013 who are regularly lumped in with Mr Huang\u2019s donations.\n\nThe three were directors of Mr Huang's companies for short periods before 2014 and there are shared investments in China, but it would be a gross simplification to call this Mr Huang's money.\n\nCompare Labor\u2019s donations with the $624,000 that Mr Clements was paid from February 2016 (a month after he stepped down as state secretary) to February 2019 as a retainer from Mr Huang, plus rent-free offices.\n\nAdd the $35,000 cash Mr Clements says that Mr Huang gave him for his legal fees in a sexual harassment investigation in August 2015, and the $10,000 that Mr Clements obtained from Mr Huang in May 2015 (at the instigation, he says, of then-senator Sam Dastyari) to help fund a right-wing union campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s a total of $669,000. Meanwhile, Mr Huang employed former Labor state treasurer Eric Roozendaal for more than four years and former Nationals deputy premier Andrew Stoner for three years.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing illegal in hiring former political figures. What\u2019s notable is just how little Mr Huang gave Labor once he had both Mr Clements and Mr Roozendaal on board.\n\nDonations warning\n\nIn August 2015, it's been reported that ASIO director general Duncan Lewis visited Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, the Nationals\u2019 Scott Mitchell and Labor\u2019s national secretary, George Wright, specifically to warn them of dangers from donations from Mr Huang and others who were linked to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nWhat none of these figures knew was that at the same time, as the former Labor state secretary's jaw-dropping testimony shows, Mr Huang was presenting Mr Clements with a wine box stuffed with $35,000 at Mr Huang\u2019s Mosman mansion on the weekend of August 8-9 2015, together with a piece of paper that read, \u201cFor your legal fees\u201d.\n\nIn a bizarre twist, ICAC has tabled evidence that days before this, on August 3, Mr Huang contacted NSW Police to apply for a gun licence \u2013 presumably he would have been asked about this if had had testified by video link, as requested.\n\nLabor raised another $85,000 from Mr Huang in the 10 months after Mr Lewis' warning, and the Liberals $178,000.\n\nMr Huang reportedly cancelled a further $400,000 for Labor in June 2016, after shadow defence spokesman Stephen Conroy criticised China\u2019s position in the South China Sea.\n\nThis was despite three meetings with Labor leader Bill Shorten in the year to March 2016.\n\nAnd then the donations stopped. It was hard times now for those trying to hit Mr Huang up for money. But as Mr Clements made clear, that wasn't for everyone.", "description": "Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo wasn\u2019t really such a big Labor donor.
