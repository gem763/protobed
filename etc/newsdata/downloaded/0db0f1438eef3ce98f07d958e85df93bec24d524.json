But it isn\u2019t just showing new products; it\u2019s telling a story. Over the years, the presentation has gotten flashier, but the story hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nThe keynotes always open with a video, which conveys a theme or idea that the keynote echoes. It\u2019s the introduction to the story. But it usually isn\u2019t about products. It\u2019s about imagination, accessibility, or even New York City.\n\n\u266a I happen to like New York. I happen to like this town \u266a\n\nApple includes several more videos throughout its presentation. These build suspense leading up to a product reveal. And make a product feel larger than life.\n\nThen, it\u2019s time for a history lesson. Tim Cook takes the stage, says \u201cgood morning.\u201d\n\nCook: Good morning.\n\nNarrator: And shows how Apple has been in your life for years. He also explains the positive impact Apple has had. Part of that impact is growing communities. Apple products aren\u2019t presented as just computers or phones. The devices bring people together. And improve their lives.\n\nYou might have also noticed that they exaggerate\u2026a lot. Apple describes everything with superlatives. Just listen to this description of the Apple Watch. That same segment says beautiful seven times. Repetitive exaggeration drives home Apple\u2019s message about a product. If a speaker keeps saying revolutionary, you walk away thinking this phone is revolutionary.\n\nBut you won\u2019t find too many specs in an Apple presentation. Apple talks in percentages more often than specifics. It\u2019s 40% lower power.\n\nPhil Schiller: 40% more energy efficient.\n\nNarrator: Or five times faster.\n\nTom Boger: Five times faster than before.\n\nNarrator: You just need to know that this new version is better than the old one.\n\nSchiller: The iPhone XS Max.\n\nNarrator: Apple doesn\u2019t spend time talking about RAM or milliamps. It prefers fancy marketing terms, like Retina or 3D Touch.\n\nThen it improves on its own terms. Plus to Max. Retina to Super Retina. But it still manages to keep the message clear and simple, often using a single phrase per slide.\n\nIt also helps that Apple\u2019s presenters are experts at keeping the audience engaged. They tell you exactly what to think.\n\nSchiller: Well, you are going to be blown away with the pictures you can take with the iPhone XS\u2019s camera.\n\nJeff Williams: We think you\u2019re gonna love everything about the new displays on Series 4.\n\nSchiller: We all love the cameras in our iPhone.\n\nNarrator: And they talk in a conversational tone.\n\nCook: Wasn\u2019t that a fun video?\n\nNarrator: It feels like a small presentation you were invited to. Not a livestream that millions are watching. Apple\u2019s keynotes started a trend that many other tech companies have followed. But companies like Google and Samsung aren\u2019t nearly as effective as Apple. Compare the introduction of the Galaxy Note 10 to the iPhone XS.\n\nDrew Blackard: The Note 10 is built for a new generation. It\u2019s a generation that\u2019s reshaping everything about how we work and how we live. These days, we\u2019re catching up on work email one minute and gaming with friends the next. The line between work and play has pretty much disappeared. And that means we need technology that can seamlessly flow between the two.\n\nSchiller: I am so excited to tell you all about iPhone XS. It is made of a surgical-grade stainless steel. It has a gorgeous new gold finish, on the front and on the glass. It is the most beautiful iPhone we have ever made.\n\nNarrator: Apple is specific. It shows instead of just telling. And you\u2019re made to believe this is the most beautiful iPhone ever because of Phil Schiller\u2019s delivery. Samsung tries to be everything at once, and the message gets lost. But Apple is able to tell a cohesive story that keeps you engaged.\n\nLayering these techniques creates a presentation that feels important. Nothing may be new, but it all feels groundbreaking.\n\nCook: That uses intelligent software to make the most stunning portraits. This was only previously possible with pro-level equipment.\n\nNarrator: He\u2019s just talking about the iPhone\u2019s camera. Nothing specific or new. Apple uses bold statements to reinforce its importance.\n\nLaura Legros: Now, the MacBook Air set the bar for great battery life in a thin and light computer, and the new MacBook Air is no exception.\n\nSchiller: What the team has done is truly, truly break through. It\u2019s called the A12 Bionic. Your photos look stunning on iPhone XS.\n\nNarrator: And it works. These presentations build huge anticipation before a product launch. With Apple products, it often feels as though the design is more important than what\u2019s inside. The same is true of these keynotes.\n\nApple is selling the brand, not an iPhone. And these presentations have become an essential part of that sale.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
