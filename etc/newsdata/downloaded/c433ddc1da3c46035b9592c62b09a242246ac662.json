Meyer, said that while some jurors were \u201cvery disturbed\u201d by Mr. Craig\u2019s conduct, \u201cthe law was presented to us in a very narrow fashion\u201d that ruled out conviction.\n\nBecause the statute of limitations had run out to hold Mr. Craig accountable for any actions before October 2013, jurors were limited to considering whether he deceived federal officials during the three-month period that followed. Mr. Meyer said that four jurors switched their votes from guilty to not guilty after the panel sent a note to the judge to verify the limited time frame.\n\n\u201cBased on that very narrow thing, we couldn\u2019t find anything he had done that warranted finding him guilty,\u201d he said. Mr. Meyer added that Mr. Craig, in testifying in his own defense, came across as \u201cvery credible.\u201d\n\nMr. Craig\u2019s defense team insisted that prosecutors had concocted a charge out of a few minor omissions of facts that Mr. Craig was never under any obligation to reveal. \u201cMr. Craig is not the kind of person who would lie to a U.S. government agency, not after a 50-year career based on character and trust,\u201d another of his lawyers, William Murphy, told the jurors.\n\nProsecutors said Mr. Craig gave in to hubris and self-interest, hiding the truth of his media contacts, not only from the Justice Department, but from his own firm\u2019s general counsel. Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez, one of the prosecutors, described Mr. Craig\u2019s final letter on the matter to the Justice Department as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d of lies and half-truths.\n\n\u201cIf you read the letter,\u201d he argued, \u201cyou will find contempt for the FARA unit.\u201d\n\nThe FARA unit\u2019s inquiry concerned a 2012 report that Mr. Craig and his law firm \u2014 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom \u2014 produced for the Ukrainian government, then led by Viktor F. Yanukovych. Mr. Craig and his fellow lawyers were hired to review Ukraine\u2019s prosecution of an opposition leader who had recently been sentenced to seven years in prison on corruption charges \u2014 a case that the United States and other Western nations had condemned as politically motivated. Mr. Yanukovych and his allies hoped the Skadden report would blunt criticism of the prosecution from the West.\n\nThe report, which earned the law firm $4.6 million, concluded that while the opposition leader\u2019s rights had been violated at trial, her conviction was backed by evidence.", "description": "Jurors reached a verdict after only hours of deliberation. The trial of Mr. Craig, a former White House counsel, painted an unflattering portrait of Washington lobbying.", "authors": ["Sharon Lafraniere"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/us/politics/00dc-craig/00dc-craig-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
