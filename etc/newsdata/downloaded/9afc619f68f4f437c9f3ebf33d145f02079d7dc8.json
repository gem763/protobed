Mueller\u2019s family said their daughter was held in solitary confinement, tortured, and raped by Baghdadi. Her body has never been recovered.\n\n\"I still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\" her mother Marsha Mueller told the Arizona Republic over the weekend.\n\nCarl and Marsha Mueller stayed silent about their daughter\u2019s captivity at the request of U.S. authorities, they said. After her death, they spoke critically of the Obama administration\u2019s handling of foreign hostages.\n\nCarl Mueller, who has spoken at Trump\u2019s rallies, said he was grateful the president mentioned their daughter in his news conference announcing Baghdadi\u2019s death on Sunday.\n\n\"He knows her story. He's been briefed on it, and he knows, and that\u2019s important to me,\" Carl Mueller said. \"I don\u2019t think anything would have stopped him from getting this guy.\"\n\nThe operation that killed Baghdadi has been named after Mueller.\n\n\u201cWe'll be calling Kayla's family. What \u2014 what he did to her was incredible. It's a well-known story, and I'm not going to say it, but you know that,\" Trump said Sunday from the White House. \"He kept her in captivity for a long period of time. He kept her in his captivity, his personal captivity. She was a beautiful woman, beautiful young woman. Helped people. She was there to help people. And he saw her, and he thought she was beautiful, and he brought her into captivity for a long period of time, and then he killed her. He was an animal, and he was a gutless animal.\"", "description": "Kayla Mueller\u2019s parents chided former President Barack Obama in their praise of President Trump after a special operations raid killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd38a66/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdf%2F7b%2Fffa9c7f146fe94d642cfcf4995c2%2Ftrump-obama.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
