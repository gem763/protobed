It is not purely and simply defensive. We have a long history in the region,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nThe investment underscores BRF's goal to remain a leading supplier to countries of the Gulf, he said.\n\nMost of the output from the new plant, estimated at around 50,000 tonnes per year, would be for the Saudi market, but can also be directed to neighboring countries.\n\nBRF, which has operated in the Middle East since the 1970s, said the plant's product portfolio will include breaded and marinated products and burgers, among others.\n\nThe plan is to start operating the new plant by end-2021, Moura said.\n\nAccording to the USDA, Saudi Arabia's chicken production in 2019 is forecast at 730,000 tonnes and is projected to increase to 750,000 tonnes next year. Chicken consumption this year is estimated at 1.33 million tonnes and is forecast to reach 1.38 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nBRF said the precise location, investment schedule and capital structure of its Saudi Arabia factory would be determined later.\n\nMoura declined to discuss financing for the project in detail, but said there is \"no obligation\" to take out loans in the region. The plant will generate 1,000 direct and indirect jobs and will be 100% owned by BRF, he said.\n\nThe halal market, which requires an animal be slaughtered in accordance with Muslim rules for its meat to be allowed for consumption, represented about 27% of BRF global food volumes, generating net sales of 2.4 billion reais ($602 million) in the second quarter.\n\n($1 = 3.9855 reais) (Reporting by Jamie McGeever and Ana Mano, Editing by Louise Heavens, Alison Williams and Dan Grebler)", "description": "S\u00c3O PAULO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Brazilian food processor BRF SA on Tuesday announced an agreement to invest around $120 million to build its first chicken processing plant in Saudi Arabia in a bid to strengthen its position in a key growth market.
