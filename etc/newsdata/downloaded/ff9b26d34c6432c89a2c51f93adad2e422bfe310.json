There's nothing you can do, it's nature unfortunately.\"\n\nThe incident could also take an emotional toll, as elephants have been known to display signs of grief\n\nThe fall has a history of similar incidents with a herd dying in exactly the same place in 1992.\n\nAround 300 wild elephants currently live in the park, which covers more than 2,000 square km (772 square miles) of forest and grassland.\n\nIt is home to various wild animals, including bears, elephants and gibbons, and is a popular destination for tourists.\n\nPark chief Tunya Netithammakul ordered the waterfall to be temporarily closed to visitors following the incident.\n\nElephants are Thailand's national animal but their numbers have dwindled to only a few thousand due to deforestation.", "description": "WARNING - UPSETTING CONTENT Devastated officials in Khao Yai Nationa Park, Thailand, made the grim discovery after hearing cries coming from the area", "authors": ["Grace Witherden"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20467902.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_051019Slug_2322JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
