Concerns over the future are winning,\u201d Hardy told the Oil & Money Conference.\n\nJeremy Weir, executive chairman and CEO at Trafigura, also sees oil prices in the $50s in 12 months, maybe slightly lower than they are now.\n\nAccording to Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00f6rnqvist, chief executive at Gunvor Group, oil prices will likely trade below $60 a year from now.\n\nGunvor\u2019s chief executive also believes that OPEC may need to take further action to rebalance the market.\n\n\u201cI suspect Opec will need to rein the market in,\u201d T\u00f6rnqvist told the Financial Times. \u201cSupply is rising and the market is signalling there is more than enough oil,\u201d he added.\n\nJust as Vitol\u2019s Hardy, T\u00f6rnqvist also believes that \u201cthere seems to be very little risk premium from the geopolitical issues associated with the Saudi strikes.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is This The Next $170 Billion Energy Industry In The US?\n\nOn the sidelines of the same event, Shell\u2019s chief executive Ben van Beurden said it was \u201ca bit puzzling\u201d over how well the market took the attacks in Saudi Arabia in stride.\n\n\u201cThe market is a little bit anesthetized by trade wars and the glut of shale to the point where it has become blas\u00e9 about geopolitical risk. I think it\u2019s not representative of the real picture,\u201d van Beurden told Bloomberg TV\u2019s Annmarie Hordern on the sidelines of the Oil & Money Conference.\n\nNot all analysts, however, are as bearish on oil prices as are the world\u2019s top oil traders. S&P Global Platts Analytics sees Brent Crude ending this year trading at $65 to $70 a barrel, expecting crude oil stock draws in November and December to turn around the current bearish sentiment.\n\nThe market is currently driven by sentiment \u201crather than the real strong fundamentals of it,\u201d Shell\u2019s van Beurden told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to make sense out of the market even on the best of days.\u201d\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Brent Crude will still trade range-bound in the $50s a year from now, the heads of the world\u2019s largest independent oil and commodity trading groups said on Wednesday", "authors": ["Tsvetana Paraskova"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
