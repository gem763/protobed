I needed this win. I put a lot of pressure on myself in the last fights. But for some reason, this fight, I knew it was gonna be tough \u2013 but I just kind of wiped it away and was like, \u2018Hey man, just do what I do.\u2019 I was pretty relaxed for this camp.\u201d\n\nMuch was made going into the bout about a beef between Gracie and Swanson, the latter of whom got turned away from Gracie jiu-jitsu schools as he went to train for the bout.\n\nBeing the veteran, Swanson has a better grasp on the situation, and after the fight, he made clear to Gracie that he has no issue with Gracie with him personally, but rather with some of the more backwards thinking among some in the jiu-jitsu world.\n\n\u201cI told him I respected him,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cI respect him a lot. I know growing up, he\u2019s probably had big shoes to fill. My beef wasn\u2019t with him, per se \u2013 it was the politics of jiu-jitsu, and they can just decide to out someone, you know? I\u2019m just not a fan of that kind of bully style. But I just wanted him to know that it\u2019s not something that he did personally. When you go three rounds with someone like that, you say, \u2018Hey man, keep your head up. I\u2019ve got 30-something fights \u2013 you\u2019re gonna come back stronger.\u2019 He\u2019s a warrior.\u201d\n\nWhile Swanson has spent much of his career with Jackson Wink MMA in New Mexico, he also is known for going from gym to gym and learning what he can. If Gracie wants to have Swanson\u2019s career longevity, he believes his vanquished foe should consider doing the same.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest things is that he said maybe I\u2019m not loyal,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd in his day, which is old school, you\u2019ve gotta stick it out with someone. But we\u2019re in an era where you\u2019ve gotta learn what everyone knows. You\u2019ve gotta be a student of the game. You\u2019ve gotta travel. That\u2019s what a real samurai does. My advice to him is to travel \u2013 go be humble, go out and train, get as good as possible, and train with everybody. If you stick at one gym, you\u2019re not gonna grow. He was wrong in that aspect.\u201d\n\nGallery Cub Swanson def.
