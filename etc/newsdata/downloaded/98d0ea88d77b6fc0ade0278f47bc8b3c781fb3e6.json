He was referring to business deals Hunter Biden was involved in that drew substantial investment from Chinese government-owned financial institutions. There is no evidence that the former vice president traded favours with the Chinese government to help his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the country.\n\nTrump\u2019s extraordinary request mirrors his 2016 comments as a presidential candidate when he invited Russia to hack and publicly release the emails of his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. And it echoes what he privately said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call, pressing him to probe the Bidens on unsubstantiated allegations of corruption in their Ukrainian dealings.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump reportedly promised China\u2019s president that he\u2019d stay quiet on Hong Kong protests as long as trade talks progressed\n\n\n\nThe call eventually led an intelligence officer to file a whistleblower complaint, and spurred Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks came just one week before a Chinese delegation is set to arrive in Washington for trade negotiations. Moreover, any trade deal struck with the world\u2019s second largest economic power would be subject to immediate scrutiny \u2013 and raise questions about whether Trump offered Beijing beneficial terms in exchange for dirt on his political rivals.\n\nCNN recently reported that Trump raised Biden\u2019s political fortunes \u2013 as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2013 during another June phone call.\n\nStill, Trump maintained he had a range of choices when it came to dealing with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a meeting with them, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the talks on Thursday. \u201cI have a lot of options on China. But if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power.\u201d\n\nBeijing has a lot of new leverage in the grinding trade war.\n\nTrump launched the trade war against China in early 2018, aiming to rectify an economic relationship he believed was damaging and unfair to the United States, particularly on the theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfers. But trade negotiations have stalled this year \u2013 and both the US and China have slapped hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each other\u2019s goods, contributing to a cooling of their economic growth.\n\nSeeking to strike a deal that ends the pain, Chinese government officials could \u201ctry to hint at a potential exchange of policy concessions for information, if the information is damaging at all,\u201d Victor Shih, a Chinese political economy professor at the University of California San Diego, told Reuters.\n\nTo seal a favourable deal, China could publicly open an investigation into the Bidens, or could secretly share information on their China dealings with Trump or his emissaries. They could even fabricate business dealings about the Bidens to damage one of Trump\u2019s top rivals.\n\nGiven its extensive surveillance capabilities, China would likely already have any compromising information on the Bidens\u2019 dealings without needing to publicly open an investigation, according to Mary Lovely, a China expert at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nPelosi says it\u2019s \u2018almost not worth\u2019 impeaching Trump, but that the Constitution and democracy \u2018is worth it\u2019\n\n\n\nIf the Bidens did something wrong, Lovely told Insider, \u201cand that\u2019s a big if, China would already know. I don\u2019t think this adds much information for them.\u201d\n\nLovely also said, \u201cWhat it does add is another brick onto Trump\u2019s domestic problems,\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s public call for China to probe the Bidens. Instead, \u201cthe Chinese government is focused on ending the trade war that doesn\u2019t undermine Xi\u2019s political power.\u201d\n\nImpeachment is adding uncertainties to the already volatile trade war.\n\nTrump has little room to manoeuvre with China, given the US has already levied tariffs on $US550 billion worth of Chinese goods, with more set to go into effect Dec. 15 on consumer goods such as laptops, cell phones, and toys. Trump could hike existing tariff rates, but that would lead to even more price increases that would hurt Americans, who are already bearing their cost.\n\nAs a result, several of the president\u2019s advisers have reportedly urged him to make a deal with China and avoid any escalations that further hit American\u2019s wallets.\n\nYet the impeachment probe and any attempt by Trump to link Biden to a possible deal throws a wrench into how long it will take for the dust to finally settle from the trade war.\n\nEleanor Olcott, a Chinese policy analyst at the TS Lombard consultancy, told the South China Morning Post: \u201cThe impeachment proceedings tie Trump\u2019s hands when it comes to his domestic agenda, so his attention will be focused on his foreign policy stance, meaning we are likely entering a period of more volatile trade war news.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
