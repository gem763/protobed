(AP) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Wednesday that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a recent heart attack.\n\nThe Vermont senator backtracked in an interview with NBC News just a day after indicating that health concerns would force him to change \u201cthe nature\u201d of his campaign, in the short term, at least.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders told NBC.\n\nThe 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist was hospitalized after experiencing chest discomfort while campaigning in Las Vegas last week. His staff initially said two stents were inserted for a blocked artery in his heart. Two days later, they revealed he had a heart attack.\n\nSanders told NBC it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest his staff hadn\u2019t been forthright about his condition. He said he was still talking to doctors and trying to understand what was going on.\n\nThe focus on Sanders\u2019 health comes as age plays a significant role in the 2020 presidential campaign. Should he win the Democratic presidential nomination, he would be the oldest person ever elected. So would his 76-year-old Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nSanders\u2019 apparent reversal is at odds with one of his national co-chairs Nina Turner, who said in a Tuesday interview that the campaign was examining where and how to make changes to reflect concerns about the senator\u2019s health.\n\nSanders has been among the most aggressive campaigners in the Democratic race, sometimes making multiple campaign appearances each day on multiday campaign swings through key states across America.\n\nWhile Sanders had campaign appearances scheduled for the coming days, Sanders\u2019 wife, Jane O\u2019Meara Sanders, said Wednesday that he would stay in Vermont until next week\u2019s debate.\n\n___\n\nPeoples reported from New York.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Wednesday that he \"misspoke\" when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a recent heart attack.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Wilson Ring", "Steve Peoples"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/election_2020-sanders_22801_c0-10-1974-1160_s1770x1032.jpg?b3bcd2a7b52d51836e02e8891436e5b0b697b64d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
