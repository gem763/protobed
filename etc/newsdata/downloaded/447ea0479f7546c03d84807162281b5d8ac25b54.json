But campaigners shouted \"shame on you!\" as their legal fight was \"dismissed on all grounds\".\n\nToday Tory pensions minister Guy Opperman confirmed: \"This government will abide by court decisions and follow the law.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"And if there are any changes to the two independent High Court judges who heard the case and made the decision, then clearly the government will obey that.\"\n\nBut women would face a long battle in the Court of Appeal before they would win any new help.\n\nAnd today Tory ministers were slammed from all sides in the Commons for not doing more to help the women sooner.\n\nTory MP Tim Loughton warned \"many are still struggling\" and urged ministers to consider new transitional arrangements.\n\nTory MP Julian Lewis also demanded \"alternative schemes\" to \"mitigate the problems that have resulted\".\n\n218 MPs have backed a motion demanding a \"temporary special measure\" in law to provide \"restitution\" to 3.8million women hit.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLabour's Shadow Pensions Minister Jack Dromey demanded more help for the women affected.\n\nHe said: \"3.8 million women born in the 1950s, who built Britain, face hardship as the consequence of pension changes by this Government and argued before the court - a cavalier disregard - they were told they had no right to be consulted in terms of the change of retirement age.\n\n\" Labour has already committed to some preliminary measures, early retirement, pension credit and we will now consult with the women concerned about how much further we can go to bring justice to them.\"\n\nHe said: \"Thus far, the Government has committed to nothing.\n\n\"The Prime Minister said however during the Conservative leadership contest, and I quote, he is committed to doing everything he can to bring justice to the 1950s women.\n\n\"Can the minister update the House on progress or will this be just another cynical broken promise on the part of the Prime Minister?\"\n\nBut there were angry objections from Labour MPs as Mr Opperman suggested Mr Dromey should consult his own wife - Harriet Harman, a former minister in the Labour government.\n\nA hike to women's state pension age from 60 to 65, over 10 years starting in 2010, was first proposed in the 1995 Pensions Act.\n\nBut that was accelerated by the 2011 Pensions Act, which laid out plans to hike the age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.\n\nFacing an outcry, ministers agreed a \u00a31.1bn concession in the final stages of the Act, supposedly to limit any one person's pension age rise to 18 months.\n\nMr Opperman said: \"Well clearly these matters are the matter of a court case which may be the subject of appeal.\n\n\"But with real great respect to (him) who is to his discredit a friend of mine, the honest truth is that he should be consulting with a 1950s-born woman who was secretary of state for the department (for) work and pensions, who is the MP for Camberwell and Peckham, who is also his wife, who was also responsible for the continuation of the self same policy that he now objects to.\n\n\"It is the Labour Party for 13 years who did the perfectly proper thing of taking due account of equality and the rises in life expectancy, and it is something that they should stick to having made the decisions for 13 years.\"", "description": "Ministers gave faint hope to women who are considering a Court of Appeal fight - but were slammed by all sides for not doing more to help them now", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20394827.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_State-pension-age-legal-case.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
