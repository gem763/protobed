Cleveland was idle Thursday. The Twins lost three games off their lead in the last five days.\n\nAnd the Twins lost yet another player to injury, utility infielder Ehire Adrianza, who strained his right oblique swinging at a pitch in the second with two on. Adrianza was hurting so badly that manager Rocco Baldelli told him to bunt the runners along, which he did.\n\nThe Twins were already without Miguel Sano (sore back), Max Kepler (sore left shoulder), Marwin Gonzalez (oblique strain), Jake Cave (left groin strain) and reliever Sam Dyson (sore right biceps). Baldelli said Adrianza will not make the trip to Cleveland and may be out awhile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy, because I haven\u2019t seen a situation like this in a long time, and we\u2019ve had periods of time this year when we seem to be short on players,\u201d said Baldelli. \u201cYou usually don\u2019t see it in September because of the expanded rosters and the ability to carry as many players as you can. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nLefthander Patrick Corbin (12-7) pitched effectively for six innings at Target Field, limiting baseball\u2019s top home run-hitting team to three runs on nine hits. Twins DH Nelson Cruz hit Minnesota\u2019s one homer off Corbin in the third, his 36th, an estimated 454-foot blast into the restaurant above the batter\u2019s eye in center field.\n\n\u201cYou just try to locate early, get ahead of them, try to get them to swing at your pitch,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cThey\u2019re dangerous. I think they still lead the league in homers, or close to it. You can\u2019t make mistakes to these guys. I thought today I was able to make some good pitches. They had some ground balls that got through, but for the most part our offense did a great job and kept putting up runs throughout the game.\u201d\n\nTwins starter Kyle Gibson (13-7), back after missing nine games with ulcerative colitis, struggled through 4 2/3 innings, giving up six runs, five earned, on eight hits while walking four. Four of the runs charged to him scored with two out, the last on a passed ball after he left the game.\n\n\u201cI had a chance to get out of a lot of those innings, but just didn\u2019t do a good enough job to get out,\u201d Gibson said.\n\nThe Nationals added four runs in the sixth off reliever Kohl Stewart to seemingly put the game out of reach. The big blows were Rendon\u2019s two-run double and Soto\u2019s two-run, opposite-field homer to left. It was Soto\u2019s 34th homer; Rendon hit his 33rd in the first. But the Twins cut the lead to 10-6 in the eighth and loaded the bases with one out before former Twin Fernando Rodney struck out Cruz and pinch-hitter Jorge Polanco.\n\n\u201cIt got a little close there,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cHe comes in and gets those two big strikeouts. He\u2019s 40-something. He still throws hard. He\u2019s still out there doing it, comes in in a big spot, makes pitches. I feel like he\u2019s going to be doing this forever.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s on to Cleveland for the hobbled Twins, who have lost three of four.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re against the wall, we push back,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cTomorrow will be a good example. We all believe each other, and this is what we\u2019re here for. Anyone you ask wants to be in this situation.\u201d\n\nThe game began after a 50-minute rain delay.\n\nTAKE A SEAT\n\nTwins: All-Star shortstop Jorge Polanco did not start because of an emergency dental procedure earlier in the day, but pinch-hit in the 8th. Polanco has played 139 games, more than any other Twin, lately with a sore middle finger on his right hand. \u201cMany times we tried to get him a day (off), and we had to go to him the morning of the game and tell him we needed him to play because other guys were dealing with other things we could not work around,\u201d Baldelli said.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: Kurt Suzuki (right elbow inflammation) won\u2019t throw for a few more days, manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nTwins: Miguel Sano (sore back) and Max Kepler (sore left shoulder) took swings in the indoor batting cage, but did not play. Marwin Gonzalez (oblique strain), Sam Dyson (sore right biceps) and Jake Cave (left groin strain) remain out. \u201cI\u2019m not sure when we\u2019re going to have the entire group out there playing at the same time,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s a matter of days.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: Max Scherzer (10-5, 2.56 ERA) opens a three-game series with the Braves at Nationals Park, facing Mike Soroka (11-4, 2.67) for the second consecutive start. Scherzer\u2019s ERA is more than one run higher with Yan Gomes catching (3.44) than the injured and unavailable Kurt Suzuki (2.08).\n\nTwins: Jake Odorizzi (14-6, 3.60) opposes Cleveland in the first of three critical games with the team chasing the Twins for the AL Central lead. Odorizzi pitched effectively to no decision against the Indians in his last start, allowing two runs in 5 1/3 innings in a 5-3 Twins victory at Target Field.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto each homered and drove in three runs as the Washington Nationals beat Minnesota.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Borzi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/Nationals_Twins_Baseball_77298.jpg-d6aca_c0-117-2792-1744_s1770x1032.jpg?d3c4583829b063a567dfb4b1924eb5f917abd5a4", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
