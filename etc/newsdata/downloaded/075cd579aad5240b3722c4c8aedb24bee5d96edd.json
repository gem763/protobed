This is the turn around we wanted to see. We are now seeing it.\"\n\nThe ABS's household category for inflation saw its lowest September quarter rise since 1998 due to subdued rises in utilities up 0.7 per cent and rents up only 0.1 per cent. New dwelling purchases by owner-occupiers fell 0.2 per cent in the quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Weakness in housing related costs has played a large role in this weaker number,\" BIS Oxford Economics senior economist Sean Langcake said, \"While established house prices have recovered of late, it is the rental market and construction sector that matter for CPI inflation.\"\n\n\"Price pressures are weak in these areas, and given the outlook for residential construction, this will likely persist. Further, inflation in utilities prices remains weak.\"\n\nEY economists Jo Masters noted that in annual terms, rental inflation is now stuck at a record low of 0.4 per cent year on year for the past three quarters.\n\n\"Its unlikely to accelerate any time soon given the amount of supply coming on the market in Melbourne and Sydney,\" Ms Masters said.\n\nThe cost of building a home not including land \u2013 fell by 0.1 per cent in the quarter and have now fallen in annual terms for the first time since the series began in 1999.\n\nThe September quarter number is the 15th consecutive quarter of below-target inflation for the Reserve Bank.\n\nAlthough the Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said on Tuesday night that the focus for the central bank has been for inflation \"very much on the medium term \u2013 hence \u2018on average\u2019 and \u2018over time\u2019,\" he has still implied that the inflation rate is a key guide to interest rate decisions.\n\n\"It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target,\" Dr Lowe has said.\n\nBIS Oxford Economics's Mr Langcake said he expected rates will remain on hold through the rest of the year, but that a further easing is likely in early 2020 if unemployment did not move lower.", "description": "Inflation was 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, in line with what economists expected, easing pressure on the Reserve Bank for another interest rate cut this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6b8c31840e8bf34c91cd5e66cf51c121c3184dbc", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
