If you have a problem, you go to them. They solve it quickly,\u201d said a young mother in the town of El Aguaje, in western Michoacan state. El Aguaje is so completely controlled by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel that the young wife of lime-grove worker \u2014 who would not give her name for fear of reprisals \u2014 can\u2019t turn to police: They are too afraid to enter the town.\n\nWhen a convoy of Michoacan state police did make a rare appearance in El Aguaje last Monday, they were ambushed and slaughtered by Jalisco cartel gunmen. Thirteen state police officers were shot or burned to death in their vehicles.\n\nWhen police returned to recover the burned-out patrol vehicles the next day, they were in such a hurry to accomplish their task that they left behind the crushed, burned, bullet-pierced skulls of one of their colleagues lying on the ground.\n\nIn the neighboring town of El Terrero, meanwhile, the rival New Michoacan Family cartel and its armed wing, the Viagras\u2014 who control that side of the river \u2014 have daubed their initials on houses and lamp posts, and last week burned several trucks and buses to block the bridge and prevent a Jalisco cartel incursion.\n\nIn some cases, the government has even defended cartel boundaries, apparently as part of its strategy of avoiding bloodshed at all costs.\n\nFor example, in the Michoacan town of Tepalcatepec, police line up every day to man a checkpoint at a highway leading into Jalisco state to prevent an armed incursion by Jalisco cartel gunmen. The problem is that the government force is working in coordination with a vigilante group allied with a drug cartel. The vigilantes are posted on a nearby hilltop where they can watch over the highway, armed with .50 caliber sniper rifles.\n\nIn Guerrero state, to the east of Michoacan, soldiers and state police man checkpoints between rival gangs of vigilantes, many of which are allied with drug gangs. Soldiers allow vigilantes armed with assault rifles to roam freely, but not to invade each other\u2019s territories.\n\nAnd in the northern state of Tamaulipas, when the United States began returning asylum seekers to wait for hearings in Mexico, the government knew it couldn\u2019t protect the migrants from the Zetas drug cartel in the border city of Nuevo Laredo and so it simply bused them out of the city. Now known as the Cartel of the Northeast, the former Zetas control Nuevo Laredo so completely that they recently ordered local gas stations to refuse to sell gasoline to army vehicles.\n\nIn many regions, cartels enriched by drug profits have held extensive control for at least a decade, buying off or cowing law enforcement and building huge arsenals, along with networks of informants to protect narcotics routes from the government or rivals.\n\nThe cartel grip in Tamaulipas was so firm by 2011 that Zetas gunmen were able to kidnap almost 200 people from passing buses and kill them even as the passengers\u2019 unclaimed luggage kept piling up at local bus stations. Nobody reported the crimes for months.\n\nIn this context, the government\u2019s decision to release drug lord Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 son of imprisoned capo Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n Loera \u2014 after the Culiacan shootouts was striking only because the government so publicly dropped even the pretense of enforcing the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented for Mexican authorities to pick up a major capo and then release him; that\u2019s actually unfortunately too common,\u201d said David Shirk, a political science professor at the University of San Diego. \u201cBut what\u2019s really unprecedented is to openly acknowledge that state does not have the capacity or the stomach for to keeping a major capo behind bars because of the potential consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what message does it send to people who are under the yoke of criminal organizations all over Mexico?\u201d Shirk asked. \u201cI think the message is, \u2018You\u2019re on your own. We\u2019re not going to come in and rescue you because you could get killed in the process.'\u201d\n\nThe message to soldiers in the Mexican army is also pretty clear: The Defense Department blamed a military squad for the \u201crushed\u201d operation to arrest Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n that set off the Culiacan gun battles and pledged to investigate and punish the leaders of the squad.\n\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office less than a year ago, has repeatedly urged military restraint, saying his predecessors\u2019 hardline confrontation strategy in gang-controlled areas \u201cturned this country into a cemetery, and we don\u2019t want that anymore.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year praised a squad of soldiers for restraint after they were kidnapped and forced to return a .50 caliber rifle seized by a previous patrol. He defended the response to the Culiacan uprising by saying, \u201cThe capture of one criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people. \u2026 \u201cWe do not want deaths. We do not want war.\u201d\n\nHence, soldiers are likely to avoid taking any initiative, slide into a passive role and do anything to avoid bloodshed.\n\nAverage citizens in many zones, meanwhile, can only hope the most benign cartel comes to rule in their town. The problem is that almost all of the cartels promise to respect the local population and not kidnap them or shake them down for protection money. But all of the gangs eventually break that promise.\n\nIt thus becomes a question not of fighting the cartels, but accepting whichever seems the least malign at any given moment. And the gangs appear to be picking up on that message.\n\nWhen the Jalisco cartel left the bodies of 19 members of a rival gang scattered on an overpass in the Michoacan in August, they left behind a banner saying \u201cWe are not a threat \u2026 Beautiful people, go on about your routine.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, after the Culiacan gunbattles, Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza, a lawyer for the family of Ovidio\u2019s father, the imprisoned drug lord known as \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d said the family \u201capologizes\u201d for the shootouts and pledged, \u201cThey will take care (of the expenses) of the wounded and the dead. \u2026 However many there were, man, no problem, they will help them economically.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn his (Guzman\u2019s) territory \u2026 there are no protection payments charged to taxi drivers, or bus drivers,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez Meza, referring to extortion commonly practiced by other gangs. \u201cEvery two weeks, he draws up a list of poor people and sends it to stores, telling them to cancel their debts.\u201d\n\nAnd the message for the rest of the world? Don\u2019t expect Mexico to help capture or extradite drug lords anymore, as the country did with the elder Guzm\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cIt does send a very sobering signal, I think, to Mexico and arguably to Mexico\u2019s U.S. partners,\u201d said Shirk. \u201cIf I were going to write the next State Department advisory for Mexico, I would dramatically increase this number and the number of advisories that I had for different parts of Mexico, because it\u2019s very clear that the federal government is ceding territory \u2026 and not just rural territory, but major cities and perhaps even entire states to drug traffickers.\u201d\n\n____\n\nAP Writers Christopher Sherman and Maria Verza contributed to this report", "description": "EL AGUAJE, Mexico (AP) \u2014 The Mexican city of Culiacan lived under drug cartel terror for 12 hours as gang members forced the government to free a drug", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/ad0edb_aptopix-mexico-violence-75833-mexican-troops-arrive-military-base-in-culiacan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
