It\u2019ll be a tough election and we are going to do the best we can,\u201d he said.\n\nLeaders\u00b4 approval ratings (PA Graphics)\n\nHowever Labour struck a more optimistic tone, with Mr McDonnell telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a real go at this and I think we\u2019ll win.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll have a majority government by Christmas, so I can\u2019t think of a better Christmas present basically.\u201d\n\nLib Dem Ms Swinson said said her party\u2019s \u201cstop Brexit\u201d message was resonating with Remainers, and claimed neither Mr Johnson nor Mr Corbyn were fit to be prime minister.\n\n\u201cOur country deserves a better choice, and I am standing as candidate to be prime minister.\u201d\n\nWill the Conservative Party apologise for not fulfilling its 'do or die' pledge to leave the EU?\n\n\n\n\"No, it's Parliament that's blocked delivering Brexit\" - Cabinet Minister @MattHancock #r4today | @bbcnickrobinson | https://t.co/c375sNwTd2 pic.twitter.com/1CfFneSegG \u2014 BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) October 30, 2019\n\nAsked if she would be prepared to enter into some kind of informal deal with the Tories or Labour without those two men at the helm, she said they are parties that want to \u201cforce through Brexit on our country\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be bad for our country.
