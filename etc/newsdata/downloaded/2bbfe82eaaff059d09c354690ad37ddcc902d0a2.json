Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

We are not there yet.\u201d\n\nBrexit is expected to be high on the agenda when the French president, Emmanuel Macron, hosts the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, at a dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Sunday evening.\n\nMay\u2019s customs plan was vehemently rejected by Brexiters as impractical. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the then chair of the hardline European Research Group of Tory MPs, described it as \u201ccompletely cretinous, impractical, bureaucratic and a betrayal of common sense\u201d.\n\nBut Rees-Mogg, who is now leader of the House of Commons, made clear on Sunday he and other leavers were prepared to compromise.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson is \u2026 somebody who even the most arch-Eurosceptic, even a member of the Brexit party, can trust and have confidence in,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News if he might have to eat his words on the idea of a customs partnership, Rees-Mogg added: \u201cI don\u2019t know but there\u2019s a line from Churchill saying he\u2019d often had to eat his own words and he found it a very nourishing diet. That is something that happens in politics but it is ultimately a question of trust and about the direction in which we are going.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, government insiders remain cautious about the likelihood of securing an agreement that could be put to the Commons on Saturday \u2013 and winning a majority for it.\n\nOne pointed out that Theresa May\u2019s government believed it would win MPs\u2019 support for her deal, when it was put to the Commons for a third time in March \u2013 but it was rejected, by a majority of 58.", "description": "Boris Johnson faces crunch week as Brussels downplays chance of progress on Ireland", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c056718240807049847138986c09a57c350f53ea/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a56ce405b2e9217549ebf8b870739cb9", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
