Who thought it was a good idea?\n\nRight, I know: The same op-ed editors who thought it\u2019d be a good idea to omit the detail in last week\u2019s Kavanaugh \u201cbombshell\u201d about how his alleged victim doesn\u2019t remember any assault.\n\nThe clip was inspired by David Leonhardt\u2019s column a few days ago listing 40 or so separate grievances against Trump. The word \u201cimpeachment\u201d is never used but in the context of the Ukraine news it\u2019s Leonhardt\u2019s stab at summarizing all the reasons Trump must go. Read through it and you\u2019ll see immediately why Pelosi is inclined to focus the Democrats\u2019 impeachment process narrowly on Ukraine instead of following Leonhardt\u2019s omnibus approach. Some of what he lists, like the Ukraine business, is genuine impeachment-caliber material if the most damning allegations can be proved, but much of it falls under the broad heading of \u201cTrump being a dick.\u201d \u201cHe waved around his arms, while giving a speech, to ridicule a physically disabled person,\u201d notes Leonhardt. \u201cHe made a joke about Pocahontas during a ceremony honoring Native American World War II veterans.\u201d He\u2019s called particular women \u201ca pig,\u201d \u201ca dog,\u201d and \u201chorseface.\u201d\n\nSaid Nate Silver of Leonhardt\u2019s and the Times\u2019s laundry-list approach to Trump complaints, \u201cThis is like when you initially strike up a sympathetic conversation with the guy sitting next to you on the plane \u2026 and then he talks your ear off for the next 5 hours.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s worried that a similarly lengthy recitation in Democrats\u2019 articles of impeachment would make the general public feel that way as well. It\u2019s too easy to get lost in \u201cembarrassing but not impeachable\u201d offenses. If you want Americans to grasp that the Ukraine allegations are singularly grave, make them singular. Give them that and only that.\n\nPresumably it was Leonhardt\u2019s laundry-list take on Trump that reminded some bored NYT editor of the scroll at the beginning of \u201cStar Wars.\u201d The complaints roll past, one after another, just like the text that opens \u201cA New Hope,\u201d and this clip was the result. Maybe the Times staff was already under orders to keep an eye out for meme-able content that\u2019s more likely to be shared on social media than a URL link to a boring ol\u2019 opinion piece. (Reaction on social media to this clip was strongly negative, for what it\u2019s worth. The second clip below sums it up well.) Or maybe the media is so invested in its romantic image as part of a rebel alliance that\u2019s fighting to unseat the evil emperor that they couldn\u2019t resist a \u201cStar Wars\u201d take now that Princess Nancy has sent fighters to try to blow up the Death Star.
