It\u2019s our bread and butter. I can\u2019t think of a disease in childhood cancer that doesn\u2019t use vincristine.\u201d\n\nShortages of the chemotherapy drug, which is on back order, will likely affect children throughout the country, he said, obligating physicians to make difficult decisions.\n\n\u201cThere is no substitution for vincristine that can be recommended,\u201d Unguru said. \u201cYou either have to skip a dose or give a lower dose \u2014 or beg, borrow or plead.\u201d\n\nVincristine is one of the drugs used to manage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common childhood cancer. Vincristine is also an important agent in the treatment of Wilms tumor, a rare kidney cancer that mostly affects children.\n\nThe Children\u2019s Oncology Group, a collaboration of researchers at hospitals and cancer centers, has made recommendations for altering clinical trial treatment protocols involving vincristine, including checking the hospital pharmacy\u2019s supply before trial enrollment; considering using half the dose if the full amount is not available; skipping doses during the maintenance phase of treatment; or in some cases omitting the drug altogether.\n\n\u201cWe are all devastated,\u201d said Dr. Michael Link, a pediatric oncologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine and a former president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\nWithout vincristine, many children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia will still be cured, \u201cbut this is a difficult disease to treat in general, and with one hand tied behind your back, it makes it much more difficult,\u201d Link said.\n\nUntil earlier this year, there were two suppliers of vincristine: Pfizer and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. In July, Teva made a \u201cbusiness decision to discontinue the drug,\u201d according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nA 2-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving chemotherapy treatment in Florida.
