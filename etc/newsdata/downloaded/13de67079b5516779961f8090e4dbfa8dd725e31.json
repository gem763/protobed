I'm terrified what he can do.'\n\nUpon his arrest in Chiddingford, Surrey on May 23, police seized two blades from the flat, a hunting and combat knife.\n\nIn a police interview, the defendant told how he loved Enzo more than his wife and had a strained relationship with his parents, who did not appreciate that dogs were 'equal to humans'.\n\nThe bodies of Tatiana Koudriavtsev, 68, and Vladimir Koudriavtsev, 69, were found inside their flat at Adair Tower (pictured) in May\n\nKoudriavstev was worried about his Neapolitan Mastiff called Enzo. (Pictured a similar dog)\n\nHe told how he had practised martial arts with knives for the past 17 years and 'fantasised' about killing his parents for up to four months.\n\nHe said he had taken his hunting knife and grabbed his mother by the head and stabbed her in the neck repeatedly before walking into the bedroom and stabbing his father twice.\n\nAfterwards he said he panicked about Enzo's future and set about finding him a good home, which he refused to reveal to police.\n\nMr Orchard said: 'When asked if it was fair to say he's killed his parents over the dog, he stated that they'd had a difference of opinion and held different values as he never saw humans as more superior.'\n\nThe court heard Koudryavtsev killed his parents in a fit of 'anger and rage'.\n\nJudge Hilliard said Koudryavtsev's parents' lives 'must have been very difficult indeed' in their final weeks.\n\nThe judge said: 'A friend said the two of them were very much in love and very proud of you and your achievements.'\n\nThe defendant made no reaction as he was led from the dock.\n\nSenior crown prosecutor Olcay Sapanoglu, said: 'The tragic death of Tatiana and Vladimir Koudriavtsev was the result of pent-up anger and a three-month wish of Sergey Koudryavtsev to see his parents dead.\n\n'While he lived rent-free with his parents, disagreements had been common, especially over differences of opinion about the superiority of humans over animals.\n\n'This led to Koudryavtsev's thoughts of violence as a way to remedy what he saw as injustices against his dog.\n\n'He had been practising with a number of combat style knives found at the house, along with trying exercises such as martial arts, that he would eventually use to end the life of his parents.\n\n'In stark contrast to his violent actions, he was concerned that the arrival of the police at the pub where he made the call may cause inconvenience.\n\n'Most chilling of all perhaps is that Koudryavtsev admitted that fatally stabbing his parents felt natural.\n\n'He will now spend 26 years in prison for his crimes'.\n\nDCI Rob Pack from Specialist Crime (Homicide) said: 'This was a very sad case in which an elderly couple have been brutally murdered by their own son. Koudryavstev\u2019s explanation for his acts of parricide is hard to comprehend and I am thankful such incidents are rare.\n\n'This was one of the first cases investigated by one of the Met\u2019s new Homicide Teams launched earlier this year and it proved to be both tragic and disturbing. I would like to formerly acknowledge the dedication of all the officers and staff who worked so hard on this investigation ensuring Koudryavstev was brought to justice.'", "description": "Sergey Koudryavtsev, 48, pleaded guilty to murdering his parents at their flat in Kensington, west London.
