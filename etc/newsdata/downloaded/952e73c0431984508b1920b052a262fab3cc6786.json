That would put in doubt the company\u2019s plan to provide up to $8.4 billion to victims of past fires blamed on the company\u2019s equipment.\n\nIn Sonoma County north of San Francisco, the Kincade Fire has burned more than 75,000 acres in PG&E\u2019s service area since breaking out on Oct. 23, forcing evacuation orders for some 180,000 people.\n\nThe fire has destroyed 124 structures and more than 90,000 are threatened amid strong winds and dry weather, according to CalFire, California\u2019s fire-fighting agency.\n\nThe number of structures destroyed is key to PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy exit plan. Any fire this year caused by PG&E that destroys more than 500 homes or commercial structures would trigger a clause in the financing agreement that would allow investors to back out. The agreement has a similar termination clause for next year.\n\nPG&E said in court filings last week it has agreements to sell $14 billion of stock to affiliates of investment firms such as Abrams Capital Management LP, Knighthead Capital Management LLC and Soros Fund Management.\n\nThe cause of the Kincade Fire has not been determined. But it ignited near a broken wire on a PG&E transmission tower, raising concerns that the company\u2019s equipment may again be to blame for a massive wildfire.\n\nThe San Francisco-based power producer in January filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection anticipating its liabilities from massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 blamed on its equipment could top $30 billion.\n\nOne of the blazes, November\u2019s Camp Fire, leveled the town of Paradise and destroyed more than 14,000 structures in the deadliest and most destructive in California\u2019s modern history.\n\nPG&E\u2019s main priority in its bankruptcy is paying thousands of wildfire victims, which it expects to do with $34 billion in debt financing and its $14 billion in equity commitments.\n\nWildfire victims have rejected PG&E\u2019s plan and back a competing proposal by a group of the company\u2019s bondholders.\n\nSeveral investment firms that have committed to buy PG&E stock declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA principal at one firm, however, said the firms are standing by their commitments, noting they could simply choose to waive the termination clause even if the number of structures destroyed by the Kincade Fire tops 500.\n\nLosses from the blaze so far appear small and a determination on its cause could be some time off, he added.\n\nIt took state investigators over a year to determine that PG&E was not at fault for October 2017\u2019s Tubbs Fire, which struck Santa Rosa, California, and was the state\u2019s most destructive wildfire until the Camp Fire.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A burning structure is seen in the middle of a vineyard during the Kincade fire in Geyserville, California, U.S. October 24, 2019.
