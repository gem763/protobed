If not, we will continue to crush the heads of the terrorists the minute the 120 hours (of the ceasefire) are over,\" Erdogan told supporters in the central Turkish province of Kayseri.\n\n\"If the promises that were made to us are not kept, we will not wait like we did before and we will continue the operation where it left off once the time we set has run out,\" he said.\n\n'Medics waiting to enter town '\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Turkey-backed Syrian fighters have prevented a medical convoy from reaching Ras al-Ain. It said the medical convoy has been waiting outside the town since Friday.\n\n191017175323072\n\nSyrian state media said Turkish-backed fighters also made an \"infiltration attempt\" south of Ras al-Ain, but were repelled in clashes with Syrian government forces which had recently moved into the area. The reports gave no further details.\n\nAl Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Ceylanpinar on the Turkish side of the border, said the situation in Ras al-Ain was worrying, although the ceasefire was largely holding in other areas.\n\n\"Pro-Turkish Syrian Arab fighters have surrounded the town. They say they are allowing civilians out,\" he said.\n\n\"But they also say there are ongoing talks to persuade Kurdish fighters trapped in the city to leave their weapons, and withdraw. The SDF says a humanitarian corridor there is vital to save lives,\" Stratford added.\n\nHe also said that the withdrawal of the SDF forces was ongoing in other areas.\n\nAkar and Esper hold talks\n\nDefence Minister Hulusi Akar had a phone call with US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper late on Friday, according to the Turkish defence ministry.\n\nIt said that Akar urged Esper to ensure that Kurdish forces withdrew from the zone within the 120-hour period agreed under the truce, and also make certain that their heavy weapons were collected and fortifications destroyed.\n\nErdogan agreed the truce on Thursday during talks in Ankara with US Vice President Mike Pence on stemming the humanitarian crisis which has unfolded since the beginning of Turkey's operation on October 9.\n\n191018183950579\n\nMore than 200,000 civilians have fled their homes in northeast Syria since the offensive began, according to the Red Cross.\n\nAnkara regards the YPG, the SDF's main Kurdish component, as a \"terrorist\" group because of its links to outlawed Kurdish fighters operating in southeast Turkey.\n\nErdogan said on Friday that the planned 32km-wide safe zone would run for some 440km along the border, but the US special envoy for Syria said the accord covered a smaller area where Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies were fighting.\n\nThe Turkish president also said Turkey would set up a dozen observation posts across northeast Syria.", "description": "Ankara and Kurdish fighters accuse each other of violating ceasefire amid reports of clashes in town of Ras al-Ain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/19/f6a98b141d6f4b33ae1263c96c1ca2fb_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
