But the current environment has been particularly marked by turmoil and the appearance of rocky reefs and shifting shoals. Never mind Disney (DIS), just ask the folks at AT&T (T). Even Jack Sparrow would find these waters challenging.\n\nIn the case of Disney, the trouble here comes from Apple (AAPL) of course, while with AT&T, a Wall Street firebrand and an old-fashioned carriage skirmish are to blame.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Disney though, and their slow-burn, fall-out with bestie, Apple.\n\nI was noodling on that relationship as my Apple Watch kept defaulting to a Toy Story motif. Annoying but sensical since Toy Story is a Pixar property (a unit of Disney), and Disney and Apple have been practically related since Steve Jobs sold Pixar to Disney for $7.4 billion in 2006. The all-stock deal made Jobs Disney\u2019s largest shareholder and the black-turtlenecked-one took a seat on Disney\u2019s board.\n\nAnd thus began a cozy relationship between the two companies that extended up to and beyond Steve Jobs\u2019 death in October of 2011 and Iger joining Apple\u2019s board one month later. How cozy? Disney was the first studio to sell TV shows and movies on the iTunes store for instance. Disney revamped its stores to make them look more like Apple\u2019s. And Jobs, Iger and Tim Cook have lavished praise on each other.\n\nNow not so much.\n\n(L to R) Bob Iger, chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company, walks with Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., as they attend the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, July 6, 2016 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

Producing original programming is not the business of a hardware company, or a software company, or a platform. It\u2019s the business of a media company, a la Disney. But actually it\u2019s even more pointed than that. Debuting on Nov. 1 at $4.99 a month, (and, in an aggressive leveraging of its ecosystem, free for a year if you buy an Apple device) Apple TV+ comes out before and undercuts Disney\u2019s streaming service offering which arrives on Nov. 12 at $6.99.\n\nDisney stock took a hit on the news. Netflix (NFLX) a bit too.\n\nAwkward!\n\nApple could buy Disney in a heartbeat\n\nIger acknowledged this discomfort, but had characterized streaming conflicts mostly as a potential problem since it \u201chas not been discussed all that much\u201d by the Apple directors. But that changed. In this flywheel era, and as service becomes more and more important to Apple, one part of the business is increasingly connected to another, it became untenable for Iger to simply recuse himself from specific discussions.\n\n(This is reminiscent of what occurred in 2009 when then Google (GOOG, GOOGL) chairman Eric Schmidt, resigned from the Apple board as the iPhone and Google\u2019s Android became massive competitors. Jobs was explicit about Schmidt: \u201cUnfortunately, as Google enters more of Apple\u2019s core businesses, with Android...Eric\u2019s effectiveness as an Apple Board member will be significantly diminished, since he will have to recuse himself from even larger portions of our meetings due to potential conflicts of interest. Therefore, we have mutually decided that now is the right time for Eric to resign his position on Apple\u2019s Board.\u201d)\n\nSign up! It's free!
