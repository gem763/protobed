In both cases, its tactics are getting more innovative.\n\nWhen it comes to smuggling, North Korea's use of ship-to-ship transfers continues to circumvent sanctions \"unabated,\" including through previously unreported methods. North Korea has been so successful in importing refined petroleum that the UN report said there are no current shortages of gasoline or diesel fuel within the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Pyongyang has used increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks \"to steal funds from financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges,\" the report warned, allowing it \"to evade financial sanctions and generate income in ways that are harder to trace.\"\n\nIn both cases, North Korea relies on jurisdictions that lack either the will or the ability to stop it.\n\nA US Treasury photo show a ship-to-ship transfer with a North Korea-linked vessel. US Treasury\n\nDespite the Trump administration's claims of a stringent, international campaign of \"maximum pressure\" on North Korea, Kim Jong Un's regime can still shield itself thanks to Russia and China. Both major powers objected to some details in the UN report, in part out of fear that it would implicate Russian and Chinese nationals in helping North Korea evade sanctions. North Korea, in a demonstration of what is at stake, launched two projectiles into the sea a week after the report's release.\n\nShip-to-ship transfers remain a preferred method for North Korean sanctions evasion, particularly when it comes to smuggling resources like refined fuels, crude oil and coal. North Korea has a geographic advantage: The East and South China Seas are vast areas, and while surveillance from the US and its allies provide a great deal of evidence of North Korean activity, it cannot capture everything. This is especially true as North Korea uses as many ships as possible to avoid detection.\n\nAs the UN report showed, there are no consequences for ships that shut off the transmitters, called Automatic Identification Systems, that would indicate active smuggling operations in the waters close to North Korea. The report also called on both the shipping and commodity industries to look for illicit financial activity, something on which they have lagged far behind compared to international banks.\n\nUS Treasury\n\nPerhaps the report's more sobering revelations revolve around the extent of North Korea's cyberactivity, which has generated up to $2 billion in topline revenue\u2014an astounding amount of money considering that the country's gross domestic product in 2017 was estimated at $17 billion.\n\nAccording to information in the report provided by an unidentified UN member state, the proportion of revenue that North Korea obtains through the hacking of foreign financial institutions, including cryptocurrency exchanges, has increased relative to its more traditional illicit activities, such as smuggling fuel or luxury goods.\n\nThe remarkable details included in the UN report include 35 documented cyberattacks on financial institutions across 17 jurisdictions, including 10 in neighboring South Korea alone. North Korean hackers have attacked SWIFT, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the communications service for financial transactions used by banks all over the world. They engaged in sophisticated social engineering techniques to trick a Chilean employee of a banking network into downloading malware onto his work computer. Their cyberattacks on South Korean virtual currency providers generated tens of millions of dollars, and North Korean hackers continue to try to exploit new financial technology.\n\nIn response to all this, the UN report recommends that member states ensure virtual currency providers in their jurisdiction follow the same anti-money laundering controls as traditional banks, and that they explore strategies for improving cybersecurity protocols.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, in a photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency March 28, 2018. KCNA/Reuters\n\nNorth Korea's continued ability to get around international sanctions seems to belie the Trump administration's claims that there is in fact a \"maximum economic pressure campaign\" on Pyongyang. This reality is underscored by the degree to which Russia and China shield their own citizens who are involved in North Korea sanctions-busting activities.\n\nMany smaller jurisdictions\u2014from Namibia to Uganda to Singapore to Malaysia\u2014either have financial agents acting on behalf of North Korea within their own borders, or do not maintain domestic regulations that are strong enough to incentivize their own financial institutions to guard against North Korean activity.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that using sanctions against North Korea, as part of a wider diplomatic effort, is an exercise in futility. For one thing, any effort to close off North Korea's access to the international financial system, no matter how leaky, is worth it, given its nuclear provocations and threats to international security.\n\nAn imperfect effort to enforce sanctions is better than no effort at all, and the United States and its partners should be credited for continuously working to make those sanctions more effective.\n\nKim Yo Jong, right, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left, at the official opening of the Ryomyong residential area in Pyongyang, April 13, 2017. Associated Press/Wong Maye-E\n\nAdditionally, there is still no indication that the North Korean regime has entirely ruled out more negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program, despite their frustration with the Trump administration.\n\nNorth Korean negotiators have prioritized the removal of sanctions, which suggests that, despite how much they are able to get around these financial controls, they still want them eliminated or substantially rolled back as part of a process that leads to further normalization of relations with the United States.\n\nWhat remains to be seen, as ever, is if the Trump administration has a consistent strategy that is realistic and can produce tangible results. The recent departure of John Bolton as Trump's national security adviser\u2014apparently over Bolton's hard line toward Pyongyang, among other foreign policy disagreements\u2014may suggest an openness, at least temporarily, to expedite a new round of diplomacy that goes beyond another made-for-TV summit.Neil Bhatiya is the associate fellow for the Energy, Economics, and Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.
