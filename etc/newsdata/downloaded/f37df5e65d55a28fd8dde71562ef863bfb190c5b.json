Kerri-Anne also revealed for the first time the heartbreaking question John asked her while he was fighting for his life in hospital\n\nIn June, Kerri-Anne spoke to The Sunday Telegraph about the immediate aftermath of John's devastating fall in 2016.\n\n'The first thing John asked me was, \"Am I paraplegic?\" she said. 'I couldn't say to him at the time, \"You're not that lucky\".'\n\nKerri-Anne, who was John's primary carer before his death, added: 'He could not feed himself, he could not put a fork in his mouth. He couldn't use the remote button. He couldn't turn a page.'\n\nDifficult times: Kerri-Anne became John's primary carer before his death\n\nKerri-Anne is now determined to help other families dealing with a similar tragedy.\n\nAfter attending the opening of the Concord Golf Course last year, she approached NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and demanded more funding for spinal injury research.\n\nThis conversation sparked a series of meetings with Berejiklian and research group Spinal-Cure Australia.\n\nAs a result of Kerri-Anne's persistence, it was announced in June that $15million would be dedicated to spinal research as part of the new State Budget.\n\nActivism: Kerri-Anne is now determined to help other families dealing with a similar tragedy\n\nIn August, Kerri-Anne slammed the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) for discrimination against elderly paralysis victims after John was denied the best care after his accident.\n\n'They have taken this magic red line and put it under the age of 65, which eliminates anyone over the age of 64 and nine months,' she told The Sunday Telegraph.\n\n'I think the government should be sued on this because it is not an age-related injury. They need to put up a test case and literally sue them for age discrimination.'\n\nSuccess: As a result of Kerri-Anne's persistence, it was announced in June that $15million would be dedicated to spinal research as part of the new State Budget.
