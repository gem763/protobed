(AP) \u2014 The Southeastern Conference has a new wave of highly rated recruits to replace departed stars, Kentucky remains the favorite and two programs could be in the NCAA crosshairs.\n\nThose are among the storylines for SEC men's basketball media day held Wednesday in Birmingham.\n\nAmong those taking the podium are LSU coach Will Wade and Auburn's Bruce Pearl. Both programs are coming off terrific seasons but also were among those caught up in a federal investigation into corruption in and around college basketball.\n\nAuburn has said it expects to receive a notice of allegations from the NCAA, as North Carolina State and Kansas already have.\n\nOn the court, teams welcomed some five-star recruits. Georgia brought in freshman Anthony Edwards, rated the No. 2 overall recruit. Florida got graduate transfer Kerry Blackshear along with five-star prospect Scottie Lewis. Kentucky's latest class of talented freshmen includes Tyrese Maxey and Kahlil Whitney.
