The second individual has spoken to the inspector general of the intelligence community and has not filed a complaint.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t need to,\u201d Zaid said in a text message, adding that the person has \u201cfirst hand knowledge that supported the first whistleblower.\u201d\n\nNews that the original whistleblower\u2019s team is representing a second person was first reported Sunday by ABC News.\n\nTrump seized on the latest development in a Sunday night tweet.\n\n\u201cDemocrat lawyer is same for both Whistleblowers? All support Obama and Crooked Hillary. Witch Hunt!\u201d he said.\n\nThe crisis, which began last month with media reports revealing the original whistleblower\u2019s complaint, has quickly metastasized across the Trump administration, ensnaring senior officials such as Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who came under further scrutiny over the weekend.\n\nTrump largely stayed out of public view, spending Saturday at his golf club in Sterling, Va., and Sunday at the White House. In tweets, he attacked Democrats and some Republican detractors, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, whose impeachment Trump demanded Saturday after Romney criticized him.\n\nHe also appeared to directly link the 2020 presidential race to his efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Biden, contrary to a tweet on Friday declaring, \u201cThis has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, I would LOVE running against 1% Joe Biden \u2014 I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday, arguing that Biden and his family were \u201cPAID OFF, pure and simple!\u201d\n\n\u201cSleepy Joe won\u2019t get to the starting gate, & based on all of the money he & his family probably \u2018extorted,\u2019 Joe should hang it up,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want him dealing with China & [Ukraine]!\u201d\n\nBiden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates responded by calling it \u201cpuzzling\u201d that Trump would claim to love the prospect of a matchup against Biden, \u201cseeing as how he just sent his administration into a tailspin by trying to bully a foreign country into spreading a comprehensively debunked conspiracy theory about the vice president.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s son Hunter served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.\n\nAs vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whom Biden and other Western officials, including Republicans, accused of not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nOn Saturday, Perry\u2019s discussions with Ukrainian officials came to attention amid reports that Trump told Republicans on Friday that his July 25 call with the Ukrainian president, which is at the center of the original whistleblower\u2019s complaint, was made at the request of Perry.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s comments, which were first reported by Axios, Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said in an email that Perry encouraged Trump to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss energy security.\n\nPompeo, who was scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday, is facing growing pressure from Democrats seeking Ukraine-related documents.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Pompeo, who had spent much of the past week in Europe, missed a Friday deadline to comply with a subpoena for information about the State Department\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. Pompeo asserts that a letter sent to the committee constitutes the department\u2019s initial response.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint accused Trump of asking the Ukrainian government to help him with his reelection bid by launching an investigation into Biden. Democrats are also probing whether Trump\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $400 million in military assistance from Ukraine was linked to his push for the government there to pursue political investigations that could bolster the president\u2019s reelection bid.\n\nText messages between State Department officials, revealed by House Democrats last week, show that there was at least some concern that Trump was pursuing an improper quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d diplomat William B. Taylor wrote on Sept. 9 to Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nSondland, who has denied that Trump sought a quid pro quo, has agreed to meet privately on Tuesday with the three panels \u2014 Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and House Oversight \u2014 spearheading the probe, according to a committee aide.\n\nOn Friday, those three committees subpoenaed the White House for documents and wrote a letter to Vice President Pence demanding that he turn over documents related to his talks with Zelensky.\n\nSpeaking at a Republican event in Louisiana on Saturday, Pence blasted Democrats but gave no indication about whether he would comply with their document request.\n\n\u201cDo-Nothing Democrats launched a partisan impeachment inquiry in a blatant attempt to overturn the will of the American people in the last election,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump\u2019s campaign announced that the president would be traveling to Lake Charles, La., to hold a rally on Friday. The president will also have a rally on Wednesday in Minneapolis.\n\nNo White House officials made appearances on the Sunday morning news shows, leaving it up to congressional Republicans and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to defend the president in heated interviews during which they offered at-times-contradictory explanations for the president\u2019s actions.\n\nIn a combative exchange on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d host Chuck Todd pressed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) to explain why he told the Wall Street Journal about his concern in the summer that Trump had sought to link Ukrainian military aid to an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nJohnson repeatedly declined to answer, instead raising a conspiracy theory and criticizing the media before finally stating that Trump had \u201cadamantly denied\u201d any quid pro quo.\n\nJohnson also at one point said he does not trust U.S. intelligence agencies. \u201cSomething pretty fishy happened during the 2016 campaign and in the transition, the early part of the Trump presidency, and we still don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe do know the answer,\u201d an exasperated Todd responded, adding: \u201cYou\u2019re making a choice not to believe the investigations that have taken place.\u201d\n\nGiuliani issued a defiant defense of Trump in an interview on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cMediaBuzz\u201d in which he argued that the president \u201chas every right to ask countries to help us in a criminal investigation that should be undertaken.\u201d\n\nGiuliani was named in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and in a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky as being a key intermediary in back-channel efforts to pursue the allegations against Biden.\n\nBut other Republicans sought to play down Trump\u2019s comments, including his exchange with reporters outside the White House on Thursday in which he urged China to investigate Biden.\n\nIn an interview on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) echoed a suggestion on Friday by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) that Trump\u2019s China statement was not \u201ca real request.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorge, you really think he was serious about thinking that China\u2019s going to investigate the Biden family? . . . I think he\u2019s getting the press all spun up about this,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nDuring the interview, Stephanopoulos repeatedly sought an answer from Jordan on whether he thinks it is appropriate for Trump to ask China and Ukraine to investigate Biden. Jordan dodged the question more than a dozen times.\n\nDemocrats on Sunday defended their party\u2019s efforts to pursue an impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Rep. Val Demings (Fla.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, supported House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s view that no vote by the full House is necessary for an impeachment inquiry to move forward.\n\nShe added that she thinks the House \u201cwill have to take a serious look at articles of impeachment\u201d based on the evidence that has emerged.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), a key member of the House Democratic leadership, said on \u201cThis Week\u201d that \u201cthe evidence of wrongdoing by Donald Trump is hiding in plain sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration, without justification, withheld $391 million in military aid from a vulnerable Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president then pressured a foreign leader to interfere in the 2020 elections and target an American citizen for political gain. That is textbook abuse of power.\u201d\n\nfelicia.sonmez@washpost.com\n\ntoluse.olorunnipa@washpost.com\n\nEllen Nakashima, Abigail Hauslohner and Elise Viebeck contributed to this report.", "description": "The news, which comes as House Democrats are subpoenaing the White House for documents, deepens the political crisis involving President Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
