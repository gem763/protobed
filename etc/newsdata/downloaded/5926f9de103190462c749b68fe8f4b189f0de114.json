That\u2019s around two and a half years longer than she was expected to survive and throughout her tough and harrowing journey, she shone like a light and shared hope, faith and uplifting inspiration through her blog and her outlook.\n\nI personally remember watching Zoe \u2013 who was often jokingly labelled as the schizophrenic, murdering, arsonist, lesbian vet of the village of Emmerdale \u2013 as a child. An engaging character and central to the definitive Emmerdale family the Tates, she was in the midst of huge story after huge story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe practically WAS Emmerdale across the 90s and early 2000s, sleeping with her sister-in-law Charity, burning down a church, blowing up Home Farm and shooting her brother Chris\u2019 kidnapper in some of her more subdued moments.\n\nShe was part of the reason I became so invested in soaps \u2013 the first copy of Inside Soap magazine I bought led with the headline \u2018Tates In A State!\u2019 and featured Zoe, Chris and his kidnapper Liam. I had watched Emmerdale for a bit and was obsessed with the who kidnapped Chris strand. And thus my introduction to spoilers was tickled as I couldn\u2019t resist spending my money on a copy of my magazine \u2013 and to my parents\u2019 confusion, then asking for a subscription for my birthday. Beats a bike any day.\n\nYears later and I write about soaps for a living \u2013 and spoil them for a whole new generation of fans like me who get to enjoy the likes of Charity and Chas as modern day Emmerdale icons.\n\nI got the chance to speak with Leah \u2013 and I don\u2019t get starstruck very easily but I was humbled by her warmth and how down to earth she was. Still to the very end, she was top of the list for many fans to make a return nearly two decades after she was last seen, such was her impact on the show and its audience.\n\nNot only that, but she led the way in representation. She was one of the first lesbian characters to lead a soap and yet her sexuality didn\u2019t define her. She was moralistic yet fierce, sassy, intelligent, funny and ever so diva-ish when she needed to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her feud with the iconic Kim Tate, she was the ying to Kim\u2019s yang, making for one of the most blistering soap wars of all time. And even in her later years, her takedowns of Sadie King, her blowing up of Home Farm and her harrowing battle with Scott Windsor meant she was a huge character each year she featured.\n\nOf course, the last three years, the way everyone thinks of Leah is with even more respect and fondness. With such a bleak prognosis, many would forgive and understand a human crumbling in the face of adversity. No doubt, Leah had many moments where it must have been terrifying.\n\nMORE: Emmerdale remembers \u2018pitch perfect\u2019 Leah Bracknell as Zoe Tate actress dies aged 55\n\n(Picture: Leah Bracknell)\n\nBut she never gave up fighting and she sought to spread details of her journey, her hopes and the life lessons she was still learning to many people, all of whom fell in love with her again, for even more poignant reasons than ever before.\n\nHer uplifting blog posts, her love of nature, her peaceful messages, her admiration for the NHS, her inspirational and well written prose and her fighting spirit were utterly superhuman. We have been all left in awe of the strength she faced her biggest fight with.\n\nAnd the world has lost a huge spark and force of nature with her passing. She defied the odds, she outlasted many of the initial outlooks and she did so with bravery which made everyone who knew her proud to know her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Leah Bracknell remembered by Emmerdale stars in touching tributes as Zoe Tate actress dies aged 55\n\nLeah has passed away but to say she has lost her battle with cancer would be a gross disservice. Cancer threw everything it could at her and it never destroyed her spirit or her contagious sense of hope that put everything into perspective for whoever followed her journey.\n\nLeah may now be at peace \u2013 but she won her battle and her legacy will continue to do so. In the 90s, she won by representing LGBTQ+ where previously it lacked much mainstream limelight. Later on, she won by creating a soap icon who years and years later is still remembered as one of Emmerdale\u2019s greatest. And in her final years, she won with her courageous and inspirational accounts of a battle she fought with all of her might.\n\nShe is gone far too soon but her legacy is a mighty and superhuman one. RIP to a British TV legend and an amazing human being.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Beloved by many, she simply was Emmerdale for a huge era.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/leah-bracknell-222c.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C769px%2C404px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
