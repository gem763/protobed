Eric Greitens\u2019 signature.\n\nThe Republican-led Missouri House on Thursday cleared SB 19, a measure to prevent forced unionism previously passed by the state Senate. Greitens, a Republican who took office last month, pledged to sign it. His predecessor, Democrat Jay Nixon, vetoed a similar bill in 2015.\n\nThe House\u2019s move received praise from the GOP-led Senate.\n\n\u201cRight-to-work gives Missouri the ability to encourage other businesses to move to the state,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Ron Richard, R-Joplin. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just fighting for more jobs. We are fighting just to be on the list of consideration. Right-to-work, combined with our other economic development measures we plan to pass this session, will help make Missouri more attractive to investments. I am confident after the long hours working on the legislation the governor will sign it.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Missouri poised to pass right-to-work legislation; New Hampshire up next\n\nKentucky enacted a similar measure in January. Indiana, Michigan, West Virginia and Wisconsin have also passed right-to-work laws in the past five years.\n\nSeven of the eight states that border Missouri \u2014 Illinois is the lone holdout \u2014 have right-to-work laws, and many lawmakers and economists said that put the Show-Me State at a disadvantage in luring business and industry.\n\nRight-to-work laws prevent workers from being forced to join a union or pay union dues as a condition of employment.\n\nIt\u2019s been a decade-long battle in Missouri, where the Republican majority in the legislature debated the issue but never had the votes required to override the veto of Nixon.\n\nDan Mehan, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Business and Industry, called right-to-work an \u201ceconomic development tool\u201d for Missouri.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to finally be this close to making it law in Missouri,\u201d Mehan said in a statement. \u201cWe applaud lawmakers for their commitment to protecting Missouri jobs and Missouri families. It\u2019s a fact, right-to-work laws grow jobs and increase opportunities and economic growth.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire could also soon become a right-to-work state. A bill has passed the state Senate and has the support of the governor, but still awaits passage in the state House.", "description": "RIGHT-TO-WORK BATTLE: Right-to-work demonstrators hold signs during Missouri inaugural ceremonies .09/02/2019 3:12:06AM EST.", "authors": ["Johnny Kampis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/01/Missouri-Capitol-right-to-work-600x460.jpg"}
