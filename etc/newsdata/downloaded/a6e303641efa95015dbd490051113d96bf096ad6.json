Adam \u201cPacman\u201d Jones is retired. George Iloka is looking for work. Antonio Brown is off being Antonio Brown, stuck in self-induced NFL purgatory after flaming out in three cities in the span of six months. Le\u2019Veon Bell took a year off, then took the New York Jets\u2019 money. Joey Porter is out of coaching. Ryan Shazier\u2019s career is on hold.\n\nTogether, they spent years toeing and sometimes crossing the line between playing with an edge and something considerably darker. The list of moments memorable for the wrong reasons includes Burfict\u2019s questionable celebration after ending Bell\u2019s season in the 2015 ; Porter taking a break from his job as Pittsburgh\u2019s outside linebacker coach to walk onto the field in the final minutes of a 2015 wild-card game to jaw at Burfict, the same game when Shazier\u2019s helmet-to-helmet hit with running back Giovani Bernard led to the NFL modifying the rules on such collisions.\n\nOh, and there was the Monday night meeting in December 2017, which featured Iloka violently slamming into Brown in the end zone as Brown hauled in the winning touchdown a couple hours removed from the harrowing sight of Shazier being carted off with a spinal injury from which he is still recovering.\n\nTheir absence likely means the bad blood between both sides has subsided. That\u2019s probably a good thing considering the current state of both teams. The Steelers and Bengals are a combined 0-6 heading into Monday night\u2019s meeting in Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cBoth of our backs are against the wall, which is kind of sad at this point of the season,\u201d Pittsburgh guard David DeCastro said. \u201cIt will make for some good football, that\u2019s for sure. We both need a win very bad.\u201d\n\nThe winner can at least point toward a bit of forward momentum heading into October, while the loser will be all but eliminated from AFC North contention with the leaves still on the trees. While the Bengals began the season with modest expectations under first-year coach Zac Taylor, the Steelers figured to be in the mix with Baltimore and Cleveland. Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s season-ending right-elbow injury and a defense that\u2019s been unable to get critical stops has Pittsburgh facing just its second 0-4 start in 1968.\n\nNo wonder Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin is, as he put it this week, ticked off. Taylor isn\u2019t quite there yet with his team, though he\u2019s also well aware of the weight facing the Steelers still carries regardless of the faces or the stakes.\n\n\u201cI certainly watched my fair share of games this offseason, trying to prepare myself for what\u2019s in store in this division,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cYou get a pretty good sense of the feelings here. People aren\u2019t shy when you\u2019re out in the community in the offseason letting you know their thoughts on the Steelers.\u201d\n\nThe noise will almost certainly get louder on Tuesday morning if the Bengals can\u2019t find a way to win in Pittsburgh for the first time since November 2015.\n\nON THE RUN\n\nCincinnati\u2019s biggest issue has been a nearly nonexistent running game that\u2019s forced Andy Dalton to carry almost the entire load. It was a bit better during a 21-17 loss at Buffalo , with Joe Mixon running for 61 yards and catching two passes for 34 yards and a touchdown. Mixon came into that game averaging 1.6 yards per carry. The Bengals will try to get the running game going to keep Pittsburgh\u2019s defense from locking in on Dalton.\n\n\u201cOnce you start to get a rhythm in the run game and they start keying into it and saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got to stop the run, we\u2019ve got to stop the run,\u2019 you get the balance of the complementary stuff that plays off it,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nIN A TIGHT SPOT\n\nA week after starting safety Minkah Fitzpatrick just days after acquiring him in a trade with Miami, the Steelers are giving another new arrival a crash course with plans to immediately throw him into the fray. Pittsburgh sent a fifth-round pick in the 2020 draft to Seattle for tight end Nick Vannett. Pittsburgh is in need of help at tight end with Vance McDonald nursing a left arm injury and Xavier Grimble on injured reserve with a calf problem.\n\nHELPING MASON\n\nMason Rudolph overcame some early nerves to throw for 174 yards and two touchdowns in his first NFL start against San Francisco . The Steelers actually had the ball and the lead late in the fourth quarter before James Conner\u2019s fumble set up San Francisco for the winning touchdown. It was the second time the 49ers turned short fields courtesy of Pittsburgh turnovers into touchdowns. If those drives end in field goals instead, the Steelers aren\u2019t winless.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a guy in there, first time starting, you want to do everything you can to support him and make his job a lot easier,\u201d linebacker T.J. Watt said. \u201cAny way we can do that defensively, we\u2019re definitely going to try and do that. We\u2019ve just got to do more of it.\u201d\n\nWORST MATCHUP ON WORST STAGE\n\nThe Bengals play the team that has dominated them, on the stage where they\u2019ve been at their worst. The Bengals have lost eight straight and 11 of 12 against their AFC North rival. Oh, and the Bengals are 6-15 in prime-time games since 2011, when Andy Dalton was a rookie, including 2-5 on Monday night.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joe Kay contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The familiar faces that fueled the hostility between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals are gone.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Will Graves"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/steelers_49ers_football_27468_c0-125-2979-1861_s1770x1032.jpg?e156b76c92d2a569169dbea92187d5fb6e2ab574", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
