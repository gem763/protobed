He blinked in June when Iran allegedly attacked oil tankers in international waters and shot down a U.S. drone. Trump ordered airstrikes in retaliation and then called them off. He claimed he was worried about all of the Iranians who could get killed. But does anyone imagine Trump is a born-again humanitarian? The truth is he simply lost his nerve \u2014 as President Barack Obama did when he decided against airstrikes on Syria. In Trump\u2019s case, his reversal came after Tucker Carlson said a war with Iran wouldn\u2019t be popular with his base.\n\nNow Trump appears to have blinked again, after saying that \u201cit would look to most like it was Iran\u201d that was behind a devastating attack that knocked out half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production. Trump said he was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a response, but rather than hitting back militarily, he has (so far at least) merely chosen to order more sanctions. It\u2019s hard to imagine the mullahs will be impressed given how many sanctions the United States has already piled on as part of Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy. Is this the supermax policy?\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nThis is not an argument for attacking Iran \u2014 which Trump might still do. A small U.S. airstrike won\u2019t deter Iran \u2014 and a big one risks a major conflict. As I have written, a war with Iran has the potential to be \u201cthe mother of all quagmires.\u201d But then, that\u2019s why I thought it was a mistake to leave a nuclear accord that Iran was abiding by \u2014 and why I think it\u2019s imperative to rejoin if possible. Most experts feared Trump\u2019s move to leave the nuclear deal would only embolden Iranian hard-liners who never liked the deal in the first place \u2014 and that is precisely what has happened.\n\nRather than decrease the danger from Iran, Trump has turbocharged it. Iran is enriching more uranium and still supporting brutal proxies. Either Iran or its Houthi allies \u2014 the difference is cosmetic \u2014 are responsible for a long series of missile attacks on Saudi airports and oil infrastructure. These attacks are, at least in part, retaliation for Saudi Arabia\u2019s unsuccessful and unconscionable war in Yemen. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Iran is almost certainly guilty of cross-border aggression \u2014 an \u201cact of war,\u201d as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. All the more so if, as leaks from the U.S. government claim, the latest attack was launched directly from Iranian soil. Iran is practically daring Trump to retaliate \u2014 but having goaded Iran into the latest round of aggression, he is incapable of formulating an effective response.\n\nAnd how can he? Trump doesn\u2019t listen to his own aides and gets rid of those who disagree with him. Hence the ouster of John Bolton as national security adviser and his replacement with Robert C. O\u2019Brien, a presidential envoy whose claim to fame is observing the trial of A$AP Rocky in Sweden. His chief qualification seems to be his willingness to flatter Trump. Bolton shredded the national security decision-making process, and it\u2019s unlikely O\u2019Brien will revive it, because Trump is averse to regimentation. He thinks he has all the answers (Trump said the job of the national security adviser is \u201ceasy\u201d because \u201cI make all the decisions\u201d), and he won\u2019t listen to information that contradicts his preconceptions. He dismissed intelligence-community assessments that Iran was abiding by the nuclear accord even as he now cites the intelligence community to blame Iran for attacks in the region.\n\nTrump is probably right about Iran\u2019s responsibility for recent attacks, but no one will believe a president who has uttered 12,000-plus falsehoods. In the summer, Trump tried to assemble a coalition to safeguard shipping in the Persian Gulf. He largely failed because most of our allies don\u2019t want to be dragged into a war with Iran and don\u2019t have any faith in Trump. Even the United Arab Emirates is bailing out of the anti-Iran coalition \u2014 it is scaling back its involvement in the war in Yemen and entering into talks with Iran over maritime security. Trump is left with only one ally \u2014 Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u2014 and even he so far shies away from a direct confrontation with Iran. And for good cause: The attack on Saudi oil facilities exposed the inadequacy of the kingdom\u2019s expensive, U.S.-made air defenses.\n\nTrump could not be doing more damage to U.S. standing and security if he tried. For the record, I don\u2019t think his epic failure is dictated from Moscow. He simply doesn\u2019t know what he is doing. He doesn\u2019t think before he acts \u2014 or tweets. He makes threats that he can\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t \u2014 back up. He bullies the weak but cowers before the strong. As my colleague Dana Milbank quipped, he is pursuing \u201cbig-shtick diplomacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIranian hard-liners consider Trump\u2019s inconsistency to be weakness,\u201d Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian history, told the New York Times. The Iranian hard-liners are right: Trump is weakening the United States with his incoherent foreign policy. Our enemies don\u2019t fear us, and our allies don\u2019t trust us.\n\nRead more:\n\nKenneth M.
