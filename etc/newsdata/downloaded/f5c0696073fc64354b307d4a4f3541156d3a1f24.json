The bodies being pulled out have been flattened.\"\n\nOther survivors said they woke to a loud bang and managed to escape as the building folded in, leaving dozens of workers stranded on upper floors.\n\nBillion dollar town\n\nThe once quiet fishing village of Sihanoukville has seen a Chinese construction boom driven by tourists to its dozens of casinos in recent years, with questions raised about the speed of development in a nation notorious for lax safety standards.\n\nThree Chinese nationals and a Cambodian landowner have been held for questioning over the building collapse, which Hun Sen blamed on \"carelessness\" by the construction company.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Cambodia, a strategically important country with ports and borders to other Mekong countries, expressed their condolences and backed a \"thorough investigation\" of the role of the three Chinese nationals and the cause of the accident.\n\nThere are an estimated 200 000 construction workers in Cambodia, most unskilled, reliant on day wages and not protected by union rules, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\nBeijing is pouring investment into Cambodia as part of its behemoth Belt and Road initiative, a sweeping trillion-dollar infrastructure programme across Asia, Africa and Europe.\n\nAround $1bn was invested in the Preah Sihanouk province between 2016 and 2018 alone, and there are around 50 Chinese-owned casinos and dozens of hotel complexes under construction in Sihanoukville.", "description": "The retrieval of bodies from a building collapse in Cambodia continues, as the death toll rises to 24 with no further survivors expected to be found.
