As the pilots powered up the plane at Miami International Airport, they saw an error message for a system that tracks speed, nose direction and other critical flight information and aborted the takeoff.\n\nWhen mechanics examined the plane, they found a piece of foam glued inside a navigation system part called an air data module. Video from an American Airlines surveillance camera captured a person who drove up to the plane, got out and spent seven minutes working around the compartment containing the navigation system, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe person was later identified by co-workers as Alani, in part by his distinctive limp, the affidavit said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
