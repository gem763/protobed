Fisher\u2019s findings that only about 10% of the participants in the main \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d anti-gun protest in Washington, DC, on Saturday were under 18 years old.\n\nFisher reported the average age of a March for Our Lives attendee was \u201cjust under 49 years old.\u201d\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke wants us to listen these \u201cchildren.\u201d\n\nOur kids shouldn't have to endure active shooter drills as a normal part of their lives. We cannot be complacent. We need to listen to our children, and follow the lead of those students marching for our lives to end this epidemic. pic.twitter.com/BQp9tjdEeJ \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 21, 2019\n\nO\u2019Rourke does mention his son, Henry, coming home and talking about enduring an active shooter drill that required him to hide in a closet. This drill motivates O\u2019Rourke to pursue even more gun control.\n\nHowever, O\u2019Rourke overlooks the fact schools, with few exceptions, already enjoy 100 percent gun control via the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which was passed in 1990. Since the adoption of that act America has witnessed decades of school shootings wherein the attackers know that their victims\u2013teachers, administrators, staff members\u2013will be unarmed, therefore defenseless.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has led that charge to repeal the Gun-Free School Zones Act so attackers who enter schools can be shot and killed by armed staff before any innocents lose their lives.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s push for more gun control would only mean continuing to teach children where to run and hide. Massie\u2019s approach would relieve the fears of those children by letting them their teachers and/or principals keep protection close at hand.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News.
