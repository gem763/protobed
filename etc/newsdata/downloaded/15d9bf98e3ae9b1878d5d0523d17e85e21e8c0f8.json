Cummings had been laid up in a Johns Hopkins hospital bed for two months, crippled by pain after a difficult recovery from a heart valve replacement, when an interloper came bursting through the door, calling his name.\n\n\u201cShe reaches into her bosom and pulls out a note,\u201d Cummings said recently. \u201cShe says, \u2018The Lord has been waking me all night. \u2026 It was so important I thought I\u2019d write it down. It says: He don\u2019t mean you no harm, he\u2019s just trying to get your attention. He wants you to know he ain\u2019t finished with you yet.\u2019\u201d\n\nCummings, 67, recalled this story in an interview from his district office in Baltimore. His head: freshly shaved. His eyes: puffy. His large hands: swollen by gout. He wore big-platformed Velcro sneakers, which he had been shuffling around in all day with the help of a walker.\n\nIf God was trying to get his attention, he wasn\u2019t being subtle about it.\n\nThis month, Democrats triumphed in elections across the country, winning back the House of Representatives. In doing so, Cummings returns to Congress hobbled physically but more powerful than ever. Armed with a gavel and subpoenas, he is the soon-to-be chairman of the House Committee on Oversight.\n\nFor Cummings, this is the culmination of two years riddled with painful moments, some beyond his control and others that he walked into himself. He\u2019d tried to work with President Trump only to have it blow up in his face. He\u2019d been ignored by his Republican colleagues on the committee time and again. And he just couldn\u2019t seem to stay out of the hospital.\n\nWith a healthy heart, and in control, Cummings has limitless possible targets: hush money paid to a porn star on Trump\u2019s behalf, citizenship questions on the census, security clearances revoked from the president\u2019s critics, and dozens of other oh-yeah-remember-thats that slipped out of the churning news cycle unanswered.\n\nThe difficulty won\u2019t be finding things to look into. It will be figuring out what\u2019s worth looking into. Cummings knows by now the risks that come with opening wounds voluntarily. After he recovered from heart surgery, he checked back into the hospital for another procedure - this time on his knee. But something went wrong. The knee got infected, and Cummings spent another three months at Hopkins.\n\nHe emerged more aware than ever that there\u2019s only a finite amount of time in this world.\n\nIt will be up to him to make the best use of it.\n\n\u201cElijah Cummings was in my office,\u201d Donald Trump told the New York Times in April of 2017. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018You will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a prophecy that Cummings said he never actually offered, and one that, if he does his job well as Oversight Committee chairman, will almost certainly not come true.\n\nBut early in Trump\u2019s presidency, while many Democrats were angst-ridden, Cummings believed there was an opportunity for some good to come of it. He attended the inauguration and chatted with the president at the luncheon afterward about the need to lower prescription drug prices, an issue he\u2019d long championed.\n\n\u201cThese drug companies are getting away with murder,\u201d Cummings said the president told him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something about this.\u201d\n\nLater, Cummings accepted an invitation to the Oval Office to discuss a bill he co-authored that would do just that, and he was heartened by Trump\u2019s continued enthusiasm.\n\nAs Cummings recalls, he offered the president advice: If you stop working to divide the country and work on issues that can unite them, then you could go down in history as a great president. He honestly believed it.\n\nThe president had his base locked up no matter what, if Trump really believed shooting someone on Fifth Avenue wouldn\u2019t make them stray, so then what would the risk be to work with Democrats? He used to be a Democrat, a little voice kept reminding Cummings.\n\n\u201cPerhaps if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn\u2019t have had a lot of hope,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cHe is a man who quite often calls the truth a lie and calls a lie the truth.\u201d\n\nA week after their meeting, Trump called Cummings to let him know he hadn\u2019t forgotten about the issue and still planned to take action on it. Cummings never heard from Trump again.\n\nDoes Cummings\u2019s belief that he could work with Trump make him unbelievably naive or a man of unshakable faith?\n\nCummings grew up in Baltimore the son of two former sharecroppers from South Carolina who moved to Baltimore and became preachers. He didn\u2019t learn to dance until prom because his parents thought it was a sin. He still doesn\u2019t know how to play cards.\n\nAnd it was his parents who drove him into public service, his own form of ministry. He rarely gives a speech without mentioning his mother and how she used to soak her feet in epsom salts, singing her prayers, each night after cleaning houses. When his father died of a heart attack, shortly after giving a sermon at a women\u2019s detention center, Cummings arrived at the morgue to sort through his belongings. He found in his father\u2019s wallet a note that Cummings had written him years earlier, folded and refolded so many times over the years that it had holes in the paper.\n\n\u201cDid you know that you\u2019re my hero, and everything I\u2019d like to be,\u201d the note said, quoting the song made popular by Bette Midler. \u201cI can fly higher than an eagle because you are the wind beneath my wings.\u201d\n\nCummings\u2019s spirituality can border on hokey like that, certainly earnest in a way that most politicians are not.\n\nAt an election night watch party this year, he quoted a Garth Brooks song (\u201cThis ain\u2019t comin\u2019 from no prophet, just an ordinary man\u201d). His eyes well up when he talks about his favorite musical, \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d He meditates before each committee hearing, he said, picturing himself running down a long road, people in need of his help alongside him.\n\nThere have been stumbles. Early in Cummings\u2019s political career, he faced financial strains. According to a 1999 Baltimore Sun article, he owed more than $30,000 to the IRS (which he paid), and five times creditors took him to court to get him to pay $24,000 in overdue debts. Cummings told the paper he lacked money partially because of a major surgery that drained his bank account and because he helped support three children: a daughter he had with his then-estranged wife and two children he had with other women.\n\n\u201cI have a moral conscience that is real central,\u201d Cummings told the Sun then. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask the federal government or anyone else to do me any favors.\u201d\n\nHe remarried in 2008 (his second wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, a policy consultant, withdrew a bid for Maryland governor while Elijah was in the hospital). He has lived in the same inner-city house for three decades and, before serving 22 years in Congress, spent 14 years in the Maryland House of Delegates.\n\nHe learned his moral code in the pews and, perhaps equally important for someone going into politics, he learned the art of public speaking there, too. The first testimony he remembers giving in front of the congregation was thanking God for the integration of a local pool, which came after numerous marches where he was beaten by segregationists. He couldn\u2019t have been more than 9.\n\nHe used to run home from Sunday church service to lie on the floor and listen to Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s speeches on his transistor radio. He\u2019s been thinking a lot about one of them.\n\nIt was on the \u201cinterruptions of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat he was saying was, don\u2019t let yourself get distracted because you may never get back to what you were doing,\u201d Cummings said. After two years of Twitter tantrums from the president, wild news conferences, attacks on the media, and other smokescreens, the lesson, Cummings said, is clear.\n\n\u201cTrump, apparently was listening to Martin Luther King,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president, he said, certainly knows the power of a good distraction.\n\nAnother excerpt from the Book of Elijah:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a storm,\u201d he said from his office atop Capitol Hill. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a rough one. It\u2019s not a question of whether the storm will end but when it will end. How much of our democracy will be saved?\u201d\n\nCummings had just finished his first Oversight Committee hearing since election night, one of his last as ranking member. For six years, he has sat beside the chairman, just out of reach of real power. He\u2019s had his microphone cut off by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). He was told he could not put a woman on a panel about contraceptives. In the past two years, he has had 64 subpoena requests ignored by Chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.\n\nThe storm has been raging. But now Cummings can do something about it,\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try and make people realize that in order to live the life they are living,\u201d he said, \u201cthey need to have democracy, and it\u2019s being threatened.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s no longer asking for answers; he\u2019s demanding. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean the Trump administration will comply. Its officials have been known to be difficult, sometimes even with fellow Republicans.\n\n\u201cI sent letters and subpoenas to the Trump administration and got no response,\u201d Jason Chaffetz, the Oversight Committee\u2019s Republican former chairman told The Post this month. \u201cI was stymied every step of the way. What makes you think Elijah Cummings will get a response?\u201d\n\nCummings admits this is a concern.\n\nHe also knows that his best bet to get anything done is to be focused, not to, as he told George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d hand out subpoenas \u201clike somebody\u2019s handing out candy on Halloween.\u201d\n\nCummings has been on the other side of high-profile hearings that felt to him like a sham.\n\nThere was Operation Fast and Furious, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives program that tried to track illegal weapons sales. He was the ranking member of the Select Committee on Benghazi, a Republican-led effort to investigate the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya.\n\nThose investigations were derided by Democrats as politically motivated and, of course, Republicans will say the same about anything Cummings decides to investigate\n\nCummings says he wants to be judicious, but is that possible? How do you not try to peek at Trump\u2019s tax returns, or figure out who exactly has been staying at Trump International Hotel in Washington, or determine how former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt was able to get away with buying so many first-class airline tickets on taxpayers\u2019 dime?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone better qualified and more passionate about oversight than Elijah,\u201d Gowdy said in an interview.\n\nBut, even if Cummings is open and transparent and does everything by the book, there\u2019s at least one Republican who won\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified information, and much else, at the Senate level,\u201d Trump tweeted recently. \u201cTwo can play that game!\u201d\n\nIs it possible that Democrats are getting carried away? Can Cummings really be the hero they need to stand up to Trump? After all, Cummings may want to maintain the moral high ground, but is that even possible in a fight with the president? Is it the best way to win - to bring a Bible to a knife fight?\n\nLeana Wen, the new president of Planned Parenthood, said it\u2019s not for her to say, necessarily, but she knows a fighter when she sees one. She worked with Cummings during her time as the Baltimore health commissioner. She loved him so much she named her first child after him.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in the hospital, I tried not to think \u2026 about what could happen,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a physician, I know a lot about the worst-case scenarios because I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\n\nThe day she saw him for the first time out of the hospital, he looked and tired. She told him it was good to see him.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s good to be seen and not viewed, if you know what I mean,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cTo me, that meant he was back.\u201d\n\nCummings tends to downplay his time in the hospital. It was just a little shortness of breath. Then a simple heart procedure that should have him home within three days. Then a gout flare-up and rehabilitation to gain back muscles lost from weeks unable to move.\n\nYes, it was excruciatingly painful, he\u2019ll say. But, no, he never really thought his life was in danger. He was always itching to get back.\n\n\u201cIf he were to slow down too much,\u201d his younger brother James Cummings said, \u201cit would probably kill him.\u201d\n\nIn that case, the next two years may be the healthiest of Elijah Cummings\u2019s life.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When the word of the Lord came to Elijah, it arrived on a slip of paper tucked in a stranger's bra.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ben Terris"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2018-11-23"}
