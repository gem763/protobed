The $2,000 device was placed into a machine that rapidly folded and unfolded it, and its display failed at around the 120,169 folds mark, if not a bit sooner.\n\nWhen the Fold was announced, Samsung said it had \u201ctested up to 200,000 folds\u201d in internal testing. If you watch the company\u2019s video of those tests below (for the original Fold model), you\u2019ll notice that the device is being folded at a slower pace than the machine CNET used. Could that make a difference in terms of stress on the device? Probably. These rapid-fire tests put more stress on the Fold\u2019s hinge than it would face in real-world use by a normal user, which could account for the premature failure.\n\nThere are a few things to go over here. First, although the phone fell a little short of the expectations Samsung set, over 100,000 folds means it\u2019d last for several years based on how often people tend to check their smartphones daily, which is estimated to range anywhere between 80 and 200. But if you stick to the lower end, the Fold would survive over three years. (And remember that you\u2019ve got the glass-covered external display for quicker interactions with the device.)\n\nIt\u2019s still not ideal, and a regular smartphone will outlast the Fold\u2019s longevity. But if you\u2019re the type of person paying $2,000 for this thing, odds are, you won\u2019t still be using it by the time it dies \u2014 from folding, at least.\n\nTime of death: 2:15am PT.

It\u2019s the device\u2019s overall fragility. Samsung\u2019s futuristic, ultra-expensive gadget must be kept away from water, and we\u2019ve seen evidence (albeit extreme) that dust can still make its way in, despite Samsung\u2019s redesign of the product. The second revision seems to be failing less often than the first, but the Galaxy Fold is still a preview of a foldable phone future \u2014 and it\u2019s probably not the kind of thing to seriously consider dropping $2,000 on.", "description": "When put through a folding torture test, Samsung\u2019s $2,000 Galaxy Fold didn\u2019t quite live up to expectations set by the company for how many folds it can endure.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7riYvuby2Myiv2JxqM3p4_l3q0=/0x238:2040x1306/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19170013/VLS_2807.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
