It would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to also ban discrimination \u201con the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes.\u201d The bill\u2019s goal is to provide anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people in areas such as places of employment on a national level.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s important because it\u2019ll change a whole range of things.\u201d\n\nJudy Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, asked Joe Biden what he would do to reduce hate crimes against the LGBTQ community.\n\n\n\nBiden stressed the importance of passing the Equality Act, \u201cfirst and foremost.\u201d #EqualityTownHall https://t.co/uwN6eZAl12 pic.twitter.com/1xXlCvoEIn \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 11, 2019\n\nMatthew Shepard was a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming when he was killed, and his death became one of the country\u2019s most high-profile hate crimes against LGBTQ people. Judy Shepard and her husband, Dennis, founded the Matthew Shepard Foundation, an LGBTQ nonprofit that runs education and advocacy programs.\n\nBiden also said that his administration would track down hate groups and that he believes the correct interpretation of the Civil Rights Act includes LGBTQ people.\n\n\u201cThis is a civil rights issue. It\u2019s covered by, in my view \u2015 the court may not agree \u2015 this is a civil rights issue protected by the Civil Rights Act,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we should be focusing on how to enforce that. My Justice Department \u2015 and I guess any one of the Democrats\u2019 Justice Department \u2015 will, in fact, do that.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently divided on whether the Civil Rights Act, or Title VII, protects LGBTQ people from employment discrimination. A key part of the law bans job discrimination based on sex, though some courts in recent years have read the language to include discrimination against LGBTQ people as part of sex discrimination.\n\nBiden\u2019s answers to Judy Shepard\u2019s question were applauded, though the presidential candidate later caused a bit of discomfort in the audience after describing his first public statement supporting same-sex marriage in 2012 as when he \u201ccame out.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, when I came out and ... ,\u201d Biden said before catching himself and restarting with: \u201cWhen I publicly stated.\u201d\n\n\u201cComing out\u201d is a term often used to describe when someone chooses to publicly identify as LGBTQ.\n\nCNN hosted the town hall with the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ nonprofit organization.", "description": "At CNN's town hall, the former vice president and 2020 candidate told the murder victim's mother about his support for the Equality Act to solidify LGBTQ...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9fe37d20000058074ffc83.jpeg?cache=ccr8otsrrq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
