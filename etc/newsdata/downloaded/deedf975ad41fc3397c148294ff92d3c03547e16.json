And that oligarch happens to have a long-standing beef with Joe Biden.\n\nScott Adams, a Washington, DC talk radio host, sent out a tweet Monday night about U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, who delivered some of the impeachment inquiry\u2019s most damaging testimony yet. The tweet alleged that Taylor lied about Ukrainian natural gas baron Dmytro Firtash in a cable to State Department headquarters in 2008. At issue was a conversation Taylor had with Firtash in Kyiv that December. Taylor wrote in a diplomatic cable (later published by Wikileaks) that Firtash told him he had \u201cacknowledged ties to Russian organized crime figure [Semion] Seymon Mogilevich,\u201d one of the most notorious accused mobsters on the planet. According to Taylor, Firtash said \u201che needed Mogilevich's approval to get into business in the first place,\u201d but had not committed any crimes in the course of his business.\n\nWhen WikiLeaks published the cable in 2010, Firtash issued a statement on his website disputing its contents. Firtash, the statement claimed,\u201chas never stated, to anyone, at any time, that he needed or received permission from Mr. Mogilevich to establish any of his businesses.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Firtash reiterated that defense. Without mentioning any American official by name, he said someone must have fabricated the detail about Mogilevich. Taylor, meanwhile, has defended the State Department\u2019s notes.\n\nThe Justice Department appears to side with Taylor; its lawyers have argued in court that Firtash has ties to Russian organized crime. The criminal charges he faces, however, don\u2019t involve any such alleged relationships. Instead, the Justice Department charged him in 2014 with helming a conspiracy to bribe Indian government officials.\n\nTrump\u2019s retweet, however, offers a presidential thumbs-up to Firtash\u2019s side of the story, and raises a new line of attack on Taylor\u2019s credibility for the president\u2019s allies.\n\nAsked about his sourcing for the allegations against Taylor, Adams told The Daily Beast, \u201cMy sources are solid Foggy Bottom people.\u201d He also noted the explanation for the cable that Firtash provided to The Daily Beast earlier this year.\n\nThis specific defense of Firtash took hold in The Hill over the summer, when columnist John Solomon, whose articles informed Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Biden-Ukraine investigation, published a piece in July claiming that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s deputy said Firtash\u2019s criminal charges in the U.S. might \u201cgo away\u201d if he shared damaging information about Trump with Mueller\u2019s team. Solomon cited \u201cmultiple sources with direct knowledge\u201d and contemporaneous memos. Firtash and Solomon share the same lawyers: Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova. The husband-wife team are veterans of the conservative movement\u2019s most contentious legal battles, with longstanding ties in the Justice Department and Trump administration.\n\nUkrainian Oligarch Seethed About \u2018Overlord\u2019 Biden for Years\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
