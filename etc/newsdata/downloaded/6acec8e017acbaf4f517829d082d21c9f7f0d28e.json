Photo: HBO\n\nAfter coming out of their self-imposed, drunk exile (and dropping out of Comic-Con) to ignore your finale critiques, Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss did their first interview since the show ended in very meh fashion earlier this summer. While the duo didn\u2019t discuss the final season\u2019s lackluster reviews with Japan\u2019s Star Channel, they did admit the anachronistic coffee-cup snafu in the fourth episode was, somehow, a hoot to see unfold, and they still see its humor all these months later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tradition that you make a little mistake, because only God can do anything perfect,\u201d Benioff explained, comparing the error to crafting a fine Persian rug. \u201cWe were concentrating so much on Daenerys and Jon Snow that we just didn\u2019t see this coffee cup right in the middle. So at first I couldn\u2019t believe it, and then it was embarrassment; \u2018how did we not see this coffee cup in the middle of the shot?\u2019 And then, eventually, it was just funny. This one is just a mistake, and it\u2019s kind of funny to us now.\u201d HBO would go on to digitally edit the craft-services cup out of future airings, at an unknown cost to the network.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Weiss admitted he was a bit surprised by Thrones\u2019 record-breaking Emmy nominations for its final season, but was thrilled that the cast and crew got to end their reign on a high note. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great excuse for everyone to get drunk again,\u201d Benioff added.
