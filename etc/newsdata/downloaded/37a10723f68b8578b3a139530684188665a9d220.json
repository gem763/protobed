Nothing darling... so they can kick off.\u201d\n\nDev, 34, admitted he was \u201cgutted\u201d to be sent home so early on after facing the dance off against Lady Emma Weymouth, 33, and pro partner Aljaz Skorjanec, 29.\n\n(Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images)\n\nAnd former dancer James Jordan led the cries of derision claiming \u201cthe judges didn\u2019t do their jobs\u201d adding \u201cI was irritated by the judges. It was a bit of a farce.\u201d\n\nBut Craig claimed if the former dancing professional had been in his shoes he would have done the same.\n\nSpeaking at the Best Heroes Awards, he added: \u201cJames Jordan is just out for publicity and if he was on the judging panel, I\u2019m telling you looking at it you have to judge on what you see.\n\n\"Was Dev the right person to go on the night? Yes. Would he have been better in the future? Yes. Was he better in the past? Yes.\n\n\"He just got a dance he wasn\u2019t particularly good at and he made a mistake.\n\n\"Dev was the worst dancer on the night but if he had done his other routines then he may have been successful going through.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nCraig, who has been a judge on the BBC1 show since its launch in 2004, also said the contestants should take his comments on board as he\u2019s not being nasty but trying to help them.\n\nHe added: \u201cI am going to help then in the end. I critique them to help people.\n\n\"If you listen to my comments they are quite sound and if they go away and listen to them then they might get better.\n\n\u201cThe problem is most people in the world can\u2019t take criticism.\n\n\"You are always going to get people that can\u2019t especially people that have never danced before.\n\n\"They have only ever been praised for their work and that\u2019s why they are celebrities and they are famous because they can actually do something that they are good at.\n\n\"So when you are criticised it hurts more because you are not used to it.\u201d\n\nPreviously Craig\u2019s fellow judge Shirley Ballas blamed the viewers for the fan favourite going home.\n\nThe 59-year-old said: \u201cPeople have got to get out there and vote.\n\n\"We do our job but as you can see, there were many people who were saved with lower scores.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Craig hit back at Dev Griffin and Dianne Buswell for kicking off after they were axed from Strictly last week", "authors": ["Kelly Allen", "Image", "Dave Benett Getty Images", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637417.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_The-Best-Heroes-Awards-VIP-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
