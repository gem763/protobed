Not so much to the hype, because he really quite enjoys it, but to the notion that all who follow must be compared to the chap who went before.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s always the same, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 he tells Sportsmail. \u2018Why do I have to be the next him? People have to do better than asking about that every time. Me? I\u2019m the current Noah Lyles.\u2019\n\nIf folk don\u2019t know Noah Lyles at this point, it is likely a consequence of the other guy\u2019s abdication a couple of years back. When he left, that marvellous showman who will remain nameless for the majority of this conversation, most of the light went with him. Athletics has lingered in the shade ever since, waiting and wishing.\n\nNoah Lyles is setting tongues wagging as he lights up athletics with his electric sprinting\n\nLyles has been in rampant form this season and is eyeing Olympic Gold in Tokyo next year\n\nLyles\u2019s role in all that is to be the newest prince; the latest hope for a sport crying out for heroes. Of course, others have been stuffed into that gap \u2014 Andre de Grasse and Wayde van Niekerk, exceptional athletes with bad injuries.\n\nThen there was Christian Coleman and whatever we might now think of him. He always had the speed to make us look but lacked the charisma for transcendence, which is why we then arrived at Lyles, and in turn that is why we must go back to Coleman, because Lyles is laughing about something. He has a story involving his fellow American and why they don\u2019t get on. It reveals a bit about both men.\n\nThe yarn centres on Shanghai in May and the first Diamond League meeting of the year. Coleman, the fastest 100 metres runner in the world, was his usual picture of brooding focus on the line. Lyles, the back-flipping extrovert and 200-metre specialist, fired an imaginary gun at the camera, then beat Coleman at his own event.\n\nLyles recalls an incident with countryman Christian Coleman in Shanghai. The pair don't get on\n\nAfter winning, he glared at Coleman, who later wrote on social media: \u2018If your goal is to run fast in May to taunt and flex online then your priorities aren\u2019t straight.\u2019 Most observers scratched their heads, but it turns out there was a little more to it.\n\n\u2018My coach said he was shouting when we were warming up,\u2019 Lyles says. \u2018Then, when we got into the call room, everybody\u2019s kind of quiet, you know, getting dialled in. I see him take off his headphones and then turn his music back on as loud as you can.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just wondering, \u201cAre you really just blasting music?\u201d I feel that is kind of disrespectful. I didn\u2019t say it. I just said, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna take all this and I\u2019m gonna win this race\u201d.\n\n\u2018You know how I looked at him at the end of the race? I wasn\u2019t planning on doing that until he played that music.\u2019\n\nLyles described his struggles as a youngster to deal with the divorce of his parents\n\nIt\u2019s not a story Lyles has shared before. Likewise, some of those he tells here about depression, bullies, divorce and the single occasion he met the man who casts the shadow. In all, he has quite a tale. And quite a character. And quite a talent. And he\u2019s not afraid to talk up rivalries. And he\u2019s probably everything the sport\u2019s powerbrokers have been dreaming of.\n\nBut is Lyles, at 22, as good as he thinks he is? Can he be as good as the other guy, or better? Going into the World Championships, which begin in Doha on Friday, he fancies his chances of breaking the 200m world record. Can he be the athlete who finally brings the light back to his sport? He seems pretty confident about all that.\n\nThere was a conversation a few years back that sums up Noah Lyles\u2019s belief in his own ability. It was 2016, around the time he came within 0.09sec of making the US Olympic team in the 200m while still in high school. The University of Florida wanted to recruit him and the expectation was that they would \u2014 no male American athlete is known to have skipped the college route before going pro.\n\n\u2018I remember doing a home visit with the head coach about my goals and aspirations and I asked him a question. \u201cWhen the world record got broken, the 100m at the Olympics in 2008, how old was that guy?\u201d He looked at me and he said 22 or 23. And I was doing math in my head.\n\nThe American sprinter became the first person to win the 100m and 200m in the same season at the Diamond League\n\n\u2018I said, \u201cBy the time the 2020 Olympics comes around, I\u2019ll be 23. And I want to break the world record\u201d. And he was like, \u201cWell, you know, I did some calculations too...\u201d and I\u2019m just like, \u201cThat\u2019s great, I don\u2019t care about your calculations. I know what I can do. Do you want to go with me?\u201d Of course, he said yes.\n\n\u2018Well, later that year, some other people said yes to my goal and they got on-board, so, you know, I decided to go with adidas.\u2019 Snubbing college to go pro at 19 was a risk but what has followed has been a success for both brand and man.\n\nIn some kind of order, taking in his previous couple of seasons as an amateur, he has won the 200m at the 2014 Youth Olympics and the 100m gold at the 2016 World Juniors, broken the indoor world record for 300m in 2017, and in each of 2017 and 2018 won the 200m Diamond League title.\n\nLyles' outlandish personality could be what athletics needs to light up the sport again\n\nThen, across eight days straddling August and September of this year, he won the 2019 Diamond League 100m and 200m titles \u2014 the only man to ever hold both in the same season.\n\nThose feats are relative to the opposition, of course. His timings are relative to history, and that is where Lyles\u2019s wider potential stands out \u2014 in running 19.50sec into a headwind in the 200m this year, he became the fourth quickest man ever at the distance, behind Michael Johnson, Yohan Blake and one other.\n\nWhen he ran 19.65sec in Paris on August 24, breaking that one other man\u2019s meeting record, he went on Instagram.\n\nLyles\u2019s post read: \u2018Bolt who?\u2019\n\n\u2018That wasn\u2019t about disrespect,\u2019 Lyles says. \u2018I don\u2019t have ill will towards him. It\u2019s more like every time my name gets put into the mix, I got to hear his. So yeah, breaking that record was kind of a sign, like, it\u2019s not Usain, it\u2019s me.\u2019\n\nLyles has been impressing with his fast times and is tipped to be the next big thing in sprinting\n\nFolk in athletics have been desperate for someone like Lyles since Usain Bolt retired in 2017.\n\nAside from speaking his mind and winning races, Lyles does back-flips on the track, he modelled at Paris Fashion Week, he plans to release a rap album ahead of the Olympics, he has an easy manner and he makes people laugh.\n\nFollowing this interview, most of which is spent with him reclined on a couch in Brussels, he turns what was meant to be a two-minute picture shoot into a lengthy session of leaps and jumps and grins around the room. Like Bolt, he is an extrovert; like Bolt, it doesn\u2019t look contrived.\n\nExcept Lyles wasn\u2019t always like this. The earlier years, split between Florida and Virginia, were a struggle.\n\n\u2018Growing up, I was more of a loner,\u2019 he says. \u2018I had severe asthma as a kid, from around four to 12, and allergies, too.\u2019 He has memories of being rushed to hospital in the middle of the night with breathing difficulties.\n\nThe 22-year-old is an extrovert and is known to back flip when celebrating his track wins\n\n\u2018If I don\u2019t handle my immune system, I could become very sick for long periods,\u2019 he says. \u2018I had a lot of difficult things when I was young. My parents divorced when I was 13 and that hit each part of my family very hard.\u2019\n\nAround the same time, Lyles was found to have attention deficit disorder, ADD.\n\n\u2018I was just coming off the asthma and then got on to medication for ADD. It\u2019s like my whole personality was basically taken away because the medication would drown my emotions.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s kind of when school also became not fun at all. There was a bullying side of it and with all that the depression hit.\n\n\u2018I mean, I was involved in counselling for as long as I can remember. I have had therapy for depression since I was about nine. It has run in my family.\n\nAthletics has lost its shine since Usain Bolt's departure, but Lyles is tipped to step into that gap\n\n\u2018Sometimes I tell people and they are shocked because people can think if you are a happy person that you don\u2019t have bad times. Well, I have had this my whole life.\u2019\n\nTrack has always been his answer. His father, Kevin, was a 45.01sec 400m runner, his mother an All-American runner at college and his younger brother, Josephus, a 400m world youth silver medallist in 2015.\n\n\u2018Track was what I loved from the start,\u2019 he says. \u2018If I can be on a track, then I can be happy. It always saved me.\u2019\n\nLyles has only met Usain Bolt once. It was in 2017 in the waiting room for the controversial Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt. Lyles was visiting for an assessment on a hamstring injury.\n\n\u2018The doctor mentioned he treats Usain Bolt and, after I came out of the office, he was right there waiting to go in after me,\u2019 Lyles said. \u2018At that point my biggest accomplishment was being fourth at the Olympic trials, so he wouldn\u2019t know me, but I went up to him and I was like \u201cHey man, you do amazing things\u201d.\u2019\n\nLyles is congratulated by International Athletics chief Lord Coe for his 200m win in Belgium\n\nLyles\u2019s bid to join Bolt in the roll call of gold medal-winning athletes starts in Doha, Lyles\u2019s first senior international championships. He will only race the 200m, for which he will be the massive favourite in a field including Coleman. If the weather conditions are right, he says breaking Bolt\u2019s world record of 19.19sec is \u2018definitely possible\u2019.\n\nAfter Doha, his attention will turn to the 100m, with a bid to win both sprint golds at Tokyo 2020. For now, he is a 9.86sec runner in the 100m: good but not as good as Coleman. And not nearly as quick as Bolt. How he ultimately does in bridging those gaps in the 100m will define him.\n\n\u2018I have always known I\u2019d eventually do the 100m,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ve spoken before about this dream I had. In it I ran 9.41sec and broke the world record in the Olympic semi-final on a blue track.\n\n\u2018Funny thing, right, I get a lot of deja vu moments and dreams that come true and whatever. Let\u2019s see what happens with that one.\u2019 Indeed, let\u2019s see.\n\nIf it comes true, he might just save the sport that saved him.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: 'It's always the same, isn't it?' he tells Sportsmail.
