(Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\nSeveral myths have been debunked.\n\nOne year ago today, Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice by a 50\u201348 vote in the Senate. The vote brought to a close a vicious, partisan month-long confirmation fight, but the battle over Kavanaugh has never really ended.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, the New York Times Sunday book review section published an essay by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, two New York Times reporters and co-authors of a new book about Brett Kavanaugh, in which they claim that a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s named Max Stier \u201csaw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bombshell headline that \u201cNYT reporters\u2019 book details new sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh\u201d rocketed around Twitter on the evening of Saturday, September 14. Ronan Farrow, the muckraking journalist who played a crucial role bringing down Harvey Weinstein and other alleged sexual predators, tweeted that two New York Times reporters had \u201cdocumented another serious claim of misconduct with an eyewitness.\u201d The next day, several Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris, called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment in response to the article.\n\nBut anyone with a basic understanding of human anatomy and human behavior should have found the allegation published in the Times absurd on its face. A young Kavanaugh was standing around naked at a party when \u201cfriends,\u201d plural, \u201cpushed his penis\u201d? He just stood there without recoiling when his genitals were grabbed and \u201cpushed\u201d into someone else\u2019s hand? If this highly implausible scenario had occurred, wouldn\u2019t both the female student and Kavanaugh have been victims of this alleged assault?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat remained of the very dubious accusation was shredded with a single tweet early in the morning on September 15, when Mollie Hemingway, who had obtained an early copy of the book, wrote that the Times essay failed to report that the alleged victim has no memory of the alleged incident, a fact included in Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book. Omitting this crucial fact was one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent memory, an error the authors pinned in part on their editors. It took the Times until almost midnight Sunday to append an editor\u2019s note informing readers that \u201cthe female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.\u201d They provided no indication they had any corroboration besides Stier\u2019s claim that the alleged incident occurred, and they failed to report that Max Stier had done work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s and that his wife\u2019s judicial nomination died in 2016 because of the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, Pogrebin and Kelly conclude that their \u201cgut reaction\u201d is that the uncorroborated allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez about a teenaged Kavanaugh \u201crang true.\u201d But the authors strain to not see their own reporting in order to justify that conclusion. What the book reveals is that one year after Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation fight tore the country apart, the uncorroborated allegations against him have actually become less believable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only real bombshell in their book is the first on-the-record interview of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s lifelong friend Leland Keyser. Ford has claimed that when she was 15 years old, a 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her upstairs at a small gathering at which three other boys, Kavanaugh\u2019s friends, and Keyser, Ford\u2019s high-school classmate, were in attendance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence in [Ford\u2019s] story,\u201d Keyser told Pogrebin and Kelly. The details \u201cjust didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Ford\u2019s only friend and the only girl at the alleged party, Keyser\u2019s inability to corroborate any details of Ford\u2019s accusation \u2014 and her insistence that she had no recollection of ever meeting Kavanaugh \u2014 was the most significant development in September 2018 that led to Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now the authors had Keyser, in her own words, going much further, to say that Ford\u2019s description of the party didn\u2019t make any sense to her. Among other problems with the story was the fact that Keyser had only gone on a date or two with Kavanaugh\u2019s friend Mark Judge, and the party she recalled attending with him was very different from the one Ford described. Keyser told the authors that she spent 70 hours a week that summer in question working and practicing golf after her shift ended at the Congressional Country Club. Ford says she was at a different country club prior to the early-evening party where the alleged assault occurred, but Keyser only recalled helping Ford practice diving at that country club early in the morning.\n\nIn Ford\u2019s telling, on the night of the alleged assault, she, Keyser, and Kavanaugh\u2019s friend P. J. Smyth each had precisely one beer at the alleged party, while Kavanaugh and Judge, whom Ford alleges was a witness to the alleged assault, were so extremely inebriated at an early evening \u201cpre-gathering\u201d that Kavanaugh and Judge were \u201cpinballing off the walls.\u201d Yet Keyser insists she has no recollection of ever meeting Kavanaugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeyser told the authors she set up a second meeting with the FBI in October 2018 after she had come to doubt Ford\u2019s story, information first reported by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino in their July 2019 book Justice on Trial. She also discussed how she felt threatened by Keyser\u2019s friends to bolster Ford\u2019s story, information first reported by the Wall Street Journal last year. \u201cI was told behind the scenes that certain things could be spread about me if I didn\u2019t comply,\u201d Keyser said.\n\nPogrebin and Kelly didn\u2019t even mention Keyser\u2019s explosive comments in their New York Times essay introducing their book. They cast doubt on Keyser\u2019s memory in the book because she developed substance abuse problems later in life and point out that Keyer\u2019s statements obviously don\u2019t disprove Ford\u2019s claim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to justify their conclusion that allegations against Kavanaugh \u201crang true,\u201d the authors perpetuate several myths. For example, they write that Ford \u201chas no apparent political motivation to bring down Kavanaugh.\u201d But they report in their own book that Ford \u201cparticipated in a local Women\u2019s March protesting Trump administration policies in 2017\u201d and donated a small amount of money to progressive Democrats. Ford\u2019s lawyer Debra Katz said that Ford was partly motivated by a desire to put an \u201casterisk\u201d next to Kavanaugh\u2019s name.\n\nKavanaugh \u201cwill always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him,\u201d Katz said in a speech at the University of Baltimore\u2019s Feminist Legal Theory Conference in April 2019. \u201cThat was part of what motivated Christine.\u201d Katz\u2019s comments were first reported by Ryan Lovelace in his book Search and Destroy.\n\nTo bolster Ford\u2019s credibility, Pogrebin and Kelly write, \u201cWe have seen no evidence of Ford fabricating stories, either recently or historically.\u201d They make a passing mention of the fact that Ford said she has a fear of flying, but her ex-boyfriend said in a sworn affidavit he never knew of Ford\u2019s fear of flying during their several years of dating.\n\nBut Ford didn\u2019t merely claim that she had a fear of flying; her attorneys told Senate Republicans that her fear of flying was so great she needed the September 2018 Senate hearing delayed several days in case she needed to travel to Washington, D.C., by car.\n\n\u201cI was hoping that [the senators] would come to me, but then I realized that was an unrealistic request,\u201d Ford said in Senate testimony. \u201cSo that was certainly what I was hoping, was to avoid having to get on an airplane, but I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends, and get on the plane.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee had in fact offered to travel to California, and Ford\u2019s attorneys have claimed she was informed of the request. Ford indicated she was unaware of the request at the hearing: \u201cIf you were going to come out to see me, I would have happily hosted you and had you \u2014 had been happy to speak with you out there,\u201d she told Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley. \u201cI just did not \u2014 it wasn\u2019t clear to me that that was the case.\u201d\n\nFord flew on a private jet to Washington, and at the September 27, 2018, hearing, prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, who interviewed Ford for Senate Republicans, asked Ford how she got to the mid-Atlantic just two months earlier for a separate trip. \u201cAlso by airplane. I come here once a year during the summer to visit my family,\u201d Ford replied.\n\n\u201cIn fact, you fly fairly frequently for your hobbies and . . . you\u2019ve had to fly for your work. Is that true?\u201d Mitchell asked.\n\n\u201cCorrect, unfortunately,\u201d Ford replied.\n\nMitchell then noted that Ford had mentioned interest in surf travel to \u201cHawaii, Costa Rica, South Pacific islands and French Polynesia. Have you been all to those places?\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Ford replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy airplane?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ford said.\n\nThe evidence is fairly strong that Ford herself perpetuated a falsehood \u2014 that her fear was so great she might need to drive across country \u2014 in order to delay the hearing, which provided more time for potentially damaging information about Kavanaugh to emerge.\n\nAs Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal said when interrogating Kavanaugh, \u201cFalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.\u201d\n\n\u201cFalse in one thing, false in everything,\u201d Blumenthal said. Meaning that jurors are instructed that \u201cthey can disbelieve a witness if they find them to be false in one thing.\u201d\n\n***\n\nPogrebin and Kelly also ignore their own reporting in order to bolster a separate allegation from Kavanaugh\u2019s Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken dorm party during their freshman year.\n\n\u201cThe people who allegedly witnessed the event \u2014 Kavanaugh\u2019s friends Kevin Genda, David Todd, and David White\u2014have kept mum about it,\u201d Pogrebin and Kelly write. Earlier in the book they acknowledge that David Todd and David White and another classmate issued a joint statement to The New Yorker when the allegation first emerged. Their statement said: \u201cWe can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges every occurred, we would have seen or heard about it \u2014 and we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character.\u201d\n\nPogrebin and Kelly also conclude that their reporting suggests that the Ramirez allegation was \u201cthe talk of campus.\u201d In fact, they name precisely one Yale student, Kenneth Appold, who says he was told Kavanaugh did what Ramirez now alleges. The New Yorker had already reported in October 2018 that the eyewitness who supposedly told Appold about the incident \u201csaid that he had no memory of the incident.\u201d Only one other Yale student recalled that he heard about an incident similar to the one described by Ramirez, but he did not recall Kavanaugh\u2019s or Ramirez\u2019s name being associated with it. A few others who did not attend Yale later heard about Ramirez experiencing some sort of negative incident, but did not recall Kavanaugh\u2019s name being mentioned.\n\nThe Ramirez allegation about Kavanaugh remains as dubious as it was when, in an attempt to establish a pattern of abusive behavior by Kavanaugh, it was published by The New Yorker in September 2018. \u201cMs. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself,\u201d the New York Times reported in September 2018. Ramirez was willing to make the allegation, the New Yorker reported at the time, only after \u201csix days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney.\u201d As liberal Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty wrote in September 2018: \u201cThe New Yorker\u2019s decision to publish the story is questionable, given the paucity of corroboration for an incident that would have had so many witnesses and no doubt created a buzz in the gossip-charged environment of a college dormitory.\u201d\n\nWhat new supposedly negative information did Pogrebin and Kelly uncover during their year-long investigation of Kavanaugh? That in college Kavanaugh, after a night of drinking, allegedly banged his hands on the pick-up truck belonging to a fellow member of a Yale secret society. The pick-up truck, readers are informed, was not damaged. Really.\n\n***\n\nAnother myth is perpetuated in the book by former Obama-administration official Ben Rhodes. \u201cThe only way this guy [Kavanaugh] could survive was to go full Trump,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cHis only lifeline was to become a full-on Trump Republican.\u201d\n\nThe confirmations of justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh certainly appear to be the most consequential conservative achievements of the Trump presidency, but to accuse Kavanaugh of going \u201cfull Trump\u201d is to suggest that he embraced the worst aspects of Trump\u2019s temperament and character to survive the Senate hearings.\n\nThis is false. Kavanaugh did not lie. He did not smear his accusers. He forcefully and accurately attacked the partisan motivations of Senate Democrats with righteous indignation, much like Clarence Thomas had once accused Senate Democrats of a \u201chigh-tech lynching.\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s performance was extraordinarily emotional, but the anger and emotion that erupted that day occurred in response to Senate Democrats\u2019 taking seriously the insane claim that Kavanaugh may have been a serial gang rapist in high school, the outrageous allegation pushed by Michael Avenatti\u2019s client Julie Swetnick.\n\nLooking at the available evidence one year after the bitterly partisan hearings, it is fair to say that Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was actually a victory for truth over tribalism. The key witness, Leland Keyser, is a Democrat who owns a podcast with her ex-husband Bob Beckel, the veteran Democratic commentator and campaign official. She chose to tell the full truth as she saw it rather than win at any cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Maine moderate GOP senator Susan Collins explained her decisive vote for Kavanaugh, she delivered a 45-minute disquisition on the importance of the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof. Ford\u2019s answers to prosecutor Rachel Mitchell\u2019s sober-minded and respectful questions were what cast doubt on Ford\u2019s allegation. In a memo, Mitchell carefully explained the discrepancies in Ford\u2019s story, and how Ford first discussed an alleged assault at a therapist session in May 2012, about a month after The New Yorker reported that Kavanaugh would be Mitt Romney\u2019s most likely Supreme Court nominee. It was Arizona senator Jeff Flake \u2014 the retiring \u201cNeverTrump\u201d Republican who had no electoral motivation to confirm Kavanaugh \u2014 who insisted on giving the FBI an extra week to investigate the Ford and Ramirez allegations, an investigation that helped clear Kavanaugh\u2019s name to the extent it could be cleared.\n\nThe simple fact remains that every other real villain taken down by the Me Too movement has demonstrated a pattern of abuse. The absence of such a pattern and the lack of contemporaneous evidence is why the allegations against Kavanaugh did not sink him. And the actions of Leland Keyser, Rachel Mitchell, Jeff Flake, and Susan Collins demonstrated that Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was ultimately a triumph for civility, decency, due process.", "description": "One year ago today, Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice by a 50\u201348 vote in the Senate.
