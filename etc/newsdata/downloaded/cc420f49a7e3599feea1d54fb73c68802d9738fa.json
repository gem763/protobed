The managers were not forced to sell any physical assets.\n\nIt is all a bit like the furore surrounding Woodford Equity Income where this open-ended fund was suspended in June because it did not have enough ready cash or easily tradeable investments to meet a mountain of redemption requests. In contrast, investors in Woodford Patient Capital, set up as an investment trust, have been able to sell their holdings (see page 57).\n\nAs far as Stephen Inglis, manager of Regional REIT, is concerned, investors should only ever contemplate exposure to commercial property through an investment trust.\n\nIndeed, he forecasts the \u2018death\u2019 of open- ended property funds because of their acute difficulty in dealing with surges in investor withdrawals, prompted by bad political or economic news.\n\nRegional REIT was launched in September 2015 by London & Scottish Property Investment Management, of which Inglis is chief executive. Its mission is simple: to generate income for shareholders (paid quarterly) from a diverse property portfolio.\n\nSo far it has done rather well, growing the annual dividend from 7.65p per share in 2016 to 8.05p last year. So far this year, it has paid 0.1p more in dividends than it did in 2018 and seems on course to grow the annual dividend again. At \u00a31.03, the trust\u2019s share price remains marginally ahead of its \u00a31 launch price.\n\nThe focus is on improving the income to shareholders and spreading the risk\n\nThe dividend payments are equivalent to an annual income of 7.8 per cent. Inglis says: \u2018The focus is on improving the income we pay to shareholders and ensuring diversification of risk. The trust is not set up to deliver capital gain.\u2019\n\nThe result is an \u00a3813million portfolio spread across more than 150 properties, with income from some 850 tenants \u2013 a mix of international, national and regional businesses.\n\nOffice space accounts for 75 per cent of the trust\u2019s property exposure \u2013 retail stands at only six per cent \u2013 with the biggest slice of the portfolio located in the South East. The trust has more than \u00a362million in cash following a recent capital raising exercise.\n\nSome 60 employees oversee the trust ensuring rental voids \u2013 periods where a property is not generating a rental income \u2013 are kept to a minimum. Tenants are usually signed up on ten-year leases. Current tenants include subsidiaries of Aviva, Barclays and energy giant E.ON.\n\nLike most property trusts, shares in Regional REIT currently trade at a discount to the value of the underlying assets. This discount, currently seven per cent, could widen in the coming weeks, especially if the UK leaves the European Union with no deal agreed. But dealings in the shares will continue throughout.", "description": "Regional REIT was launched in September 2015 by London & Scottish Property Investment Management, of which Inglis is chief executive.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
