In one in eight incidents, the patient asked the medic to meet for a sexual encounter. A small number (6%) involved the doctor receiving a sexual email or letter, or a provocative photograph, from the patient.\n\nBullying and sexual harassment 'endemic' in NHS hospitals Read more\n\nWhen the perpetrators were fellow health professionals, the most common incidents involved someone deliberately infringing on their body space (46%), unwanted groping, hugging or physical contact (44%), comments about someone\u2019s body (34%), and being repeatedly asked for a date (32%).\n\nOne female doctor recalled: \u201cGeneral inappropriate comments, occasionally sexual. Hugging, hand on thigh, attempts to embarrass, bottom pinching.\u201d Another described her harassment as: \u201cFrequent putting arms around me, trying to hug, shuffling seat too close, frequent \u2018accidental\u2019 touching.\u201d\n\nOne male doctor recalled how his \u201cperpetrator made inappropriate comments about how I looked buff after I started working out. She also went on to engage in inappropriate touching.\u201d Another said: \u201cMy boss gives me a lot of unwanted attention and she touched my hands and different parts of my body almost every day.\u201d\n\nThe findings follow research which the union Unison published in June that found one in 12 NHS staff had suffered sexual harassment at work.\n\nIn July, the British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors trade union, commissioned an independent investigation into claims by two leading female GPs of sexism and sexual harassment by male colleagues.\n\nHundreds of female family doctors contacted Dr Zoe Norris and Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who are members of the general practice committee (GPC), the body which represents all GPs, after they went public with details of their experiences of misogynistic behaviour and the sexist culture of the male-dominated committee.\n\nThe Guardian revealed in February that more than 500 hospital doctors a year in England are accused of bullying and sexually harassing colleagues, but only one in six are disciplined.\n\nMore than half (56%) of respondents to Medscape\u2019s survey said they had not reported the harassment. Many said the impact on them included anxiety, avoiding working with certain colleagues and thinking about quitting.\n\nDr Helena McKeown, the BMA\u2019s chief officer, said: \u201cSexist, disrespectful and discriminatory behaviour has no place in the health service or medical profession.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment can be extremely distressing for those affected and this has wider implications on patient safety and quality of care, as this study highlights.\u201d\n\nDoctors who experience sexual harassment need much better support to cope, and it has to become easier for them to report it, she added.\n\nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \u201cNo one working for the NHS should have to tolerate sexual harassment from either patients or fellow healthcare colleagues and if there is any suggestion of criminal behaviour, the NHS will work with the police and Crown Prosecution Service to secure swift prosecutions.\u201d\n\nIt is putting \u00a32m a year into a programme which provides mental health support for victims of harassment or violence.", "description": "Offences include repeatedly asking for a date or sending explicit texts, survey shows", "authors": ["Denis Campbell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b00e6c81b6f2eb0210a8a4dacae31888e5638d2f/50_0_3387_2033/master/3387.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f8668bd831bee9a5e0b62fd7ca8bf23", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
