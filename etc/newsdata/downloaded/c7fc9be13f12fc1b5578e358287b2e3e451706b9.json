Turkey has agreed to a five-day ceasefire in northeast Syria to allow for withdrawal of Kurdish forces, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said after talks with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday.\n\nU.S. oil inventories soared for the latest week, rising much more than the market was expecting, the Energy Information Administration said.\n\njumped 9.3 million barrels last week, the EIA said. That compared to analysts\u2019 expectations for a rise of about 2.9 million barrels, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.\n\nBut fell by 2.56 million barrels, versus expectations for a drawdown of about 1.21 million barrels. fell by 3.8 million barrels, with analysts predicting a decline of about 2.4 million barrels.\n\nThe decline in fuel stockpiles came after refinery runs fell to just over 83% last week, one of the lowest in years after the peak summer driving season. Refiners typically wind down operations during the fall season to do plant repairs or upgrades. This year, many refineries are taking longer to return to ensure compatibility with new maritime fuel rules, dubbed IMO, taking effect in 2020.\n\n\u201cRefiners are really socking the oil bulls with their maintenance and it\u2019s telling with this humongous crude build, which is more than triple last week\u2019s,\u201d Investing.com analyst Barani Krishnan said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s continuous talk that the new IMO rules for maritime fuels is behind this drawdown in distillates and we\u2019ll see how accurate that is when the refiners finally come out their maintenance,\u201d he added.\n\nJohn Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, said the 83% refinery run rate was \u201ca super-low rate, even for a post-driving season, that I haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d", "description": "Oil up as U.S. Fuels Drawdown Offsets Huge Crude Build", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB9R0CL_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
