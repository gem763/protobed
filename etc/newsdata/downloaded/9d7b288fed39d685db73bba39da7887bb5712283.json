The firm is attempting to prevent wildfires caused by damaged equipment stemming from high seasonal winds. (CNN)\n\nTalking point: Earlier this year, officials determined that PG&E equipment was to blame for California\u2019s deadliest wildfire, which killed 86 people and torched 150,000 acres of land last November. The utility is still grappling with nearly US$50 billion in liabilities and thousands of lawsuits from that event, which is likely what\u2019s spurred this unprecedented preemptive move. The San Francisco Bay Area, among the places affected by the outages, is one of America\u2019s most wired regions, and California is the country\u2019s biggest electric car market. Tesla issued an official warning to customers, instructing them to charge their cars to 100 per cent to prepare for the outages. The blackouts aren\u2019t hitting everybody in the area equally\u2014the headquarters of almost every major tech giant in the region are unaffected, since they\u2019re largely served by bulky high-voltage transmission lines that are less vulnerable to the weather.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
