Ask Tourism Australia", "language": "en", "text": "Ms Harrison and Tourism Australia chief marketing officer Susan Coghill will take the new campaign to industry at a launch on Wednesday and will begin an international phased rollout across the UK, US and China from mid-November.\n\nThe campaign is centred around nine \"Philausophies\" linked to Australian attitudes and culture. They include a balanced lifestyle, mateship, storytelling, love of nature, no worries attitude, generosity of spirit, Australian flavour, and a sense of adventure and boundless optimism.\n\n\"Gone are the days of rolling out big global campaigns with operatic music and beautiful beaches. We think we need to go a bit deeper in terms of our connection with the markets we\u2019re advertising in,\" Ms Harrison said.\n\nThe campaign will be initially focused on the three key markets, but will also roll out later in smaller markets in south-east Asia and Europe over three years.\n\nCultural relevance\n\nMs Coghill said Tourism Australia was concentrating on being culturally relevant in the campaign, noting each of the \"Philausophies\" could be interpreted differently in different cultures.\n\n\"The brief to the agency was about building some stretch and flex into it \u2026 research has shown us that what mateship means in Eastern markets versus Western markets is very different,\" she said.\n\n\"For Western markets it is about coming down, being a little bit more chummy, rubbing elbows at the pub, with Eastern markets it tends to be a little bit more about feeling welcomed here. We need to make sure the executions are locally relevant.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe campaign will include advertising across outdoor, print, digital, social and video advertising. It will also include a to-be-released book with stories from famous Australians, including Kylie Minogue and Tourism Australia global ambassador Chris Hemsworth.\n\nMs Harrison said Tourism Australia was also planning a quirky campaign similar to its viral Dundee campaign which launched at last year's Super Bowl and won the top award at the 2018 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.\n\nHowever, Tourism Australia is remaining tight-lipped about what form the next phase will take.", "description": "Operatic music and beautiful beaches are out.
