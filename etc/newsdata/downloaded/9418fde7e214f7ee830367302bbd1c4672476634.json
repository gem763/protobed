And Matt Morrison (who played teacher Will Schuester) knew I was taking part, we still talk so we know what each other is up to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They also knew how much of a fan of The X Factor I was I have loved the show for years, so they are excited for me.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIn the auditions, Kevin admitted that he was \u2018a bag of nerves\u2019 after he didn\u2019t receive the best reviews from the judges.\n\nHe explained: \u2018I wasn\u2019t expecting a bigger reaction at all, I was honestly happy to just get through it.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t think my performance was that great but I think more than anything I was proud to not have completely botched it. I am a bit rusty I haven\u2019t performed live since the Glee tour in 2011.\n\n\u2018I think everyone is going to be really surprised because from the judge\u2019s houses to what we are doing in the first week, it\u2019s going to be a completely different show. Everyone has stepped it up.\u2019\n\nThe 31-year-old who shot to fame in 2009 and was also in a boyband called NLT revealed that despite his background in music, he doesn\u2019t have an \u2018advantage\u2019 on the other contestants.\n\n\u2018No I honestly don\u2019t think that,\u2019 he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think I am the one most known to have done music in my past but if anyone takes anything from the first episode they will know that everyone is on an even playing ground.\n\n\u2018In Glee, there were 80 of us and in the Glee tour, I think I only sang two songs. It is a really different thing to be out there by myself and I understand how it comes off that I might have an advantage but just know I don\u2019t feel that.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
