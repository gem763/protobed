However, permission has been granted for the case to be heard in the UK Supreme Court on 17 September.\n\nMeanwhile, a bill designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit is expected to finish its progress through the House of Lords on Friday.\n\n'National interests'\n\nFollowing the meeting of opposition parties on Friday, a Labour Party spokesman said: \"Jeremy Corbyn hosted a positive conference call with other opposition party leaders this morning.\n\n\"They discussed advancing efforts to prevent a damaging no-deal Brexit and hold a general election once that is secured.\"\n\nSNP Westminster leader Mr Blackford said he was \"desperate for an election\", but it could not be until an extension to Article 50 - the process by which the UK is leaving the EU - had been secured.\n\n\"It's not just about our own party interests, it's about our collective national interests,\" he said.\n\n\"So we are prepared to work with others to make sure we get the timing right, but the timing right on the basis of securing that extension to Article 50.\"\n\nHe added: \"We have to keep the pressure on Boris Johnson.\"\n\n'Perplexed'\n\nLiz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, said there was an \"opportunity to bring down Boris\" and \"we should take that\".\n\nAnd a Lib Dem spokeswoman said the group was clear that \"we are not going to let Boris Johnson cut and run\".\n\n\"The Liberal Democrat position for a while now is that we won't vote for a general election until we have an extension agreed with the EU. I think the others are coming round to that,\" she said.\n\n\"As a group we will all vote against or abstain on Monday.\"\n\nBut Mr Johnson said he would go to Brussels on 17 October and agree a deal so the UK can come out of the EU on 31 October.\n\nHe said resigning as prime minister if he did not get a Brexit deal by then was \"not a hypothesis\" he would be willing to contemplate.\n\nMr Johnson also said he was \"perplexed\" by the decision of opposition parties to \"run away\" from an election.\n\n\"All I see is Corbyn and the SNP clubbing together to try and lock us into the EU when it's time to get this thing done,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the most sensational paradox - never in history has the opposition party been given the chance for election and has turned it down.\"", "description": "Labour and other parties agree not to back PM\u2019s demand for a general election before October's EU summit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/721E/production/_108641292_oppositionleaders.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
