You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut a large proportion of citizens believe Russia is attempting to destabilise Europe politically, a feeling shared in Denmark, (44 per cent), France (40 per cent), Germany (38 per cent), Italy (42 per cent), Poland (48 per cent), Romania (56 per cent), Slovakia (46 per cent), Spain (44 per cent) and Sweden (50 per cent).\n\nThe report, entitled Give The People What They Want: Popular Demand For A Strong European Foreign Policy suggests the EU should become more \u201cself-sufficient\u201d in diplomatic terms.\n\nVoters polled by the research are currently however sceptical of the EU\u2019s ability to protect their economic interests, particularly in trade wars, with fewer than 20 per cent in each member state feeling their country\u2019s interests are protected from, for example, Chinese competitive practices.\n\nSome EU effort did attract support however: 57 per cent of voters across the continent are supportive of the EU\u2019s efforts to maintain the Iran nuclear deal, with support the strongest in Austria (67 per cent) and weakest in France (47 per cent).\n\nThe report\u2019s author, Senior Policy Fellow and Director of the European Power programme at ECFR, Susi Dennison, said: \u201cOur polling confirms that Trump is toxic in Europe, and that this is feeding into distrust of the US security guarantee. The fact that Europeans are split on whether defence resources should go to the EU or NATO suggests that they no longer have the confidence in the alliance they once had.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 20 pictures that sum up President Trump's visit Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.
