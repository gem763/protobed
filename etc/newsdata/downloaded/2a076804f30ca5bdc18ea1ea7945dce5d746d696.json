The approval comes after executive chairman Richard Baker\u2019s shareholder group boosted its offer by nine per cent, to $10.30 per share from $9.45.\n\nSince Baker\u2019s group floated its initial proposal in June, it has endured blowback from a chorus of minority shareholders, who derided the bid for undervaluing the company\u2019s extensive real estate in prime downtown locations housing Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th and Hudson\u2019s Bay stores.\n\nThe new price is within the range of a fairness opinion from TD Securities Inc., which told the special committee that HBC is worth between $10 and $12.25 per share.\n\nA source with knowledge of negotiations between the committee and Baker\u2019s group said talks intensified this month after the committee brought in two expert firms to value the company\u2019s real estate.\n\nBased on that analysis \u2014 along with feedback from consultants who looked at redevelopment opportunities \u2014 HBC estimated its 79 properties are worth $8.75 per diluted share, well below what activist investors have suggested.\n\nFor example, Jonathan Litt, founder and chief investment officer of Land and Buildings Investment Management LLC, in 2017 claimed that third parties had valued HBC\u2019s real estate as high as $35 a share.\n\nHBC said its valuation took into account a \u201cdeterioration of retail real estate market conditions\u201d as well as the major cash injections and a \u201clong time horizon\u201d that would be required to redevelop the department store properties. Such a move, the company said in a release, \u201cwould not result in creating additional value for shareholders in the foreseeable future, compared to the certain value provided by the transaction.\u201d\n\nThe special committee unanimously recommended that taking the \u201cimmediate and certain value\u201d from Baker\u2019s group was the better option compared to investing the \u201csubstantial capital\u201d required to keep the struggling chain relevant.\n\nCatalyst is evaluating the (new) agreement Catalyst Capital spokesman Dan Gagnier\n\nBut one of Baker\u2019s most vocal critics was apparently unmoved by the new price. A source familiar with Land and Buildings\u2019 thinking said the firm still believes the offer undervalues HBC.\n\nBaker\u2019s group, which owns 57 per cent of HBC\u2019s common shares on an \u201cas-converted\u201d basis, will need support from a majority of the minority shareholders when they vote in December. It\u2019s not publicly known how much HBC stock Land and Buildings owns, but another critic, private-equity firm Catalyst Capital Group Inc., has been amassing shares in an apparent attempt to thwart Baker\u2019s privatization plan.\n\nCatalyst in August issued an unsolicited offer to HBC shareholders to purchase up to about 10 per cent of the company\u2019s shares for $10.11 apiece. Catalyst revealed in a regulatory filing last month that it had acquired nearly 16 per cent of HBC\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock.\n\n\u201cCatalyst is evaluating the (new) agreement,\u201d spokesman Dan Gagnier said on Monday.\n\nHBC shares, which closed Friday at $9.45, jumped by more than six per cent to $10.03 in trading Monday. The discount to the sweetened bid suggests shareholders are not expecting either a white knight with a rival bid or an even richer offer from Baker. The current bid, for the shares not owned by Baker\u2019s group, is worth about $1.1 billion.\n\nA source with knowledge of the negotiations noted that a strategic bidder in the retail sector or a financial player could have made a competing proposal to acquire HBC at any time since June. Baker\u2019s group isn\u2019t interested in boosting its bid for a third time or selling its controlling stake to anyone else, the source said.\n\nIn the absence of a rival offer, the Baker bid is the best option for shareholders, said an analyst who did not want to be named.\n\n\u201cIf Baker walked away, shares would likely only trade lower,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Nine per cent bid hike may not pass approval of majority of retailer's minority shareholders", "authors": ["Jake Edmiston", "Barbara Shecter"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hbc-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
