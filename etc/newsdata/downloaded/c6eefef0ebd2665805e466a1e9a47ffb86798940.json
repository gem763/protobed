It also packs A13 Bionic processor and 6.1-inch LED Retina display, making it the most substantial of Apple\u2019s smartphones to date.\n\nAnd that\u2019s before snapping on a protective case and screen cover.\n\nOpinion: Apple\u2019s new iPhones are overpriced and behind the times\n\nAnd with the price starting at $1,099, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is not exactly light on the wallet, either \u2014 although that didn\u2019t stop Apple AAPL, -1.86% fan boys and girls from preordering the phone on Friday, and leading the #iPhone11ProMax hashtag to trend on Twitter TWTR, -1.35% throughout the day Friday.\n\nDid I just drop $1400 on a phone?

Here\u2019s the real reason Apple hasn\u2019t launched a pocket-size device\n\nIt\u2019s 66% heavier than the original iPhone that dropped in 2007, which weighed just 4.8 ounces \u2014 although of course, the overall dimensions of that phone were also much smaller, and it wasn\u2019t stuffed with as many features as its cutting-edge descendants.\n\nThe new iPhone 11 Pros have gained a bit of weight.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Two iPhone SEs equal one 11 Pro Max.\n\n\u2022 The iPhone 11 Pro weighs 16g more than the 6 Plus!\n\n\u2022 Speaking of, that iPhone 6 was damn light for its size\n\n\u2022 Heck, you could carry NINE \uf8ffWatch Sports (series 0) for one 11 Pro Max pic.twitter.com/d8mIFFHMg7 \u2014 Jonathan Deutsch (@jmfd) September 11, 2019\n\nSo in 2019, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is 54 grams heavier than the \"original\" iPhone 6 Plus from 2014.\n\n\n\nAnd iPhone 11 Pro is 59g heavier than iPhone 6.\n\n\n\nFinally, iPhone 11 Pro, the smallest of the phones, now weighs as much as 2016's iPhone 7 Plus.\n\n\n\nOof. \u2014 Joseph Kohlmann (he/him/his) (@jkohlmann) September 10, 2019\n\nWeight is my number one complaint with the iPhone XS. Sorry to see that the 11 Pro is even heavier. \u2014 Lucas Rotondo (@Lucas_Rotondo) September 12, 2019\n\nApple did not respond to a MarketWatch request for comment about its ballooning smartphones. A look back at the iPhone\u2019s specs over the past 12 years, however, shows that ever since the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were introduced in 2014, almost every generation has been heavier than the one before it as screen displays have gotten larger, and the phones have developed more advanced cameras. (The 2016 iPhone SE is a notable exception at a svelte 3.99 ounces, although that came in smaller dimensions modeled after the iPhone 5 and 5s.)\n\nHere\u2019s how much the weight of the bigger iPhones has fluctuated over the just past few years.\n\niPhone 6 Plus: 6.07 ounces\n\niPhone 6s Plus: 6.77 ounces\n\niPhone 7 Plus: 6.63 ounces\n\niPhone 8 Plus: 7.13 ounces\n\niPhone XR: 6.84 ounces\n\niPhone XS Max: 7.34 ounces\n\niPhone 11 Pro Max: 7.97 ounces", "description": "Data shows recent generations of iPhones have gotten heftier.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR294_iphone_ZG_20190913142316.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
