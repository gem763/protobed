This was the most in a six-month period since 2014, according to the department\u2019s data.\n\nThe increase came after the then Home Office minister Caroline Nokes suspended the controversial scheme in December 2018, saying \u201cwe will not tolerate people who do not play by the rules and seek to abuse the system\u201d. The government later backtracked and kept the scheme in place, but introduced tougher rules from April to tackle organised crime and money laundering.\n\nThe Home Office granted 124 applications in the three months to the end of June. That was an increase from 91 people in the same period a year earlier under more relaxed rules. Home Office data shows that just four applicants had their visas denied.\n\n\u201cLate last year the UK was poised to suspend these risky and unethical schemes but just nine months later they\u2019ve sold the highest number since 2014, with very few applicants being rejected,\u201d said Naomi Hirst, an anti-corruption campaigner at Global Witness. \u201cAt a time when the EU is moving to crack down on the sale of citizenship and residency, it\u2019s worrying that the UK is once again opening its arms to high risk but wealthy individuals. It opens the question as to whether, post-Brexit, the UK will be looking to pick up the customers that EU member states could be forced to reject.\u201d\n\nFollowing the novichok poisoning attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, which the UK government accuses Russia of ordering, the Home Office said it would crack down on the golden visa scheme and review the visas of 700 Russians who had come to Britain between 2008 and 2015 under the so-called tier 1 scheme.\n\nSome 11,000 people have entered the UK since the golden visa scheme was first introduced in 2008, mostly from Russia and China. Among them are Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea football club, although he took Israeli citizenship after the UK government failed to renew his visa last year.\n\nOther people known to have entered the UK with tier-1 visas include Zamira Hajiyeva, the woman subject to the UK\u2019s first McMafia-style \u201cdirty money\u201d unexplained wealth order who spent \u00a316m in Harrods. Hajiyeva is the wife of a banker jailed for defrauding Azerbaijan\u2019s national bank out of hundreds of millions.\n\nMadiyar Ablyazov \u2013 the son of Mukhtar Ablyazov, a Kazakhstan politician accused of embezzling $5bn (\u00a34bn) and lying to a court about the scale of his vast fortune, including a \u00a317m mansion on The Bishops Avenue in London \u2013 arrived in the UK on a tier-1 investor visa in 2008.\n\nUnder the tightened rules applicants must invest at least \u00a32m in British companies, and must be able to prove they had legitimate access to the funds for at least two years, rather than the previous 90 days. If they maintain their investment for five years they are eligible for indefinite leave to remain and apply for citizenship.\n\nLondon remains a safe haven for the world\u2019s dirty cash | Simon Jenkins Read more\n\nA spokesman for the Home Office said: \u201cAll applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules.\n\n\u201cThe tier-1 (investor) route has been reformed to better protect the UK from illegally obtained funds and ensure only genuine and law-abiding investors can secure visas. The reforms also benefit UK companies as the route is now only available to those who invest in UK businesses.\u201d\n\nAnna Harvey, a partner at Price Bailey, a law firm that provides immigration advice, said much of the increase in applicants was probably due to the fall in the value of the pound making the UK a relatively cheap place to move to.\n\n\u201cThe government has taken a tougher approach to tier-1 visas on the basis that they were open to abuse for money laundering. It may be the case that the tougher rules deterred some applicants,\u201d she added. \u201cIn that context these numbers are even more surprising.\u201d\n\nVikki Wiberg, an immigration lawyer at Taylor Wessing, also said the fall in the pound was a strong draw for the the overseas super rich looking to move to the UK. \u201cA lot of investors come to the UK seeking education for their children,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for education in English, and Brexit isn\u2019t going to change that; what Brexit has done is cause a sharp drop in the pound and that\u2019s made school fees cheaper.\u201d", "description": "Increase comes despite clampdown on scheme after Skripal novichok poisoning", "authors": ["Rupert Neate"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d88ac49826feff512bd6214b1181aa60556cd0/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=afc49e7bd6c988358145c24f541711e1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
