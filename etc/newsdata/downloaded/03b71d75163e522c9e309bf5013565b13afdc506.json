Those in the English establishment who feared the league\u2019s clout found it comforting to deride the IPL as brash and crass: frivolous entertainment, but not serious sport.\n\nAfter England\u2019s humiliating performance in the 2015 World Cup, Andrew Strauss, newly appointed as England\u2019s director of cricket, was the first involved in running the English game to embrace a simple truth. There were serious sporting - not just commercial - benefits to the IPL. It was a competition in which cutting-edge ideas and knowledge carried across national lines. Strauss noted that, of the four teams in the 2015 World Cup semi-finals, 38 out of the 44 players had IPL experience. He believed that England needed more players in the IPL if their limited overs team was to keep up.\n\nIn 2012, only three years earlier, Kevin Pietersen\u2019s determination to play in the IPL - against England\u2019s wishes - underpinned the schism with the team during Strauss\u2019s captaincy. Yet in England\u2019s first match after the 2015 World Cup, captain Eoin Morgan was 5,000 miles away, playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad. Such was Strauss\u2019s determination that English players should get more IPL exposure.\n\nPreviously, \u201cwe only had a couple of players that ever went and it was seen as a bit of a taboo place to go,\u201d Morgan recalled. He had always resisted England\u2019s caricature of the IPL. \u201cWhen you have the biggest tournament in the world, demanding the best players in the world, when players go for large sums of money, it\u2019s a compliment to them as a player to start with but it also brings added pressure.\u201d", "description": "In the final extract from their new book 'Cricket 2.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Freddie Wilde", "Michael Vaughan", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000203801844-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYWNJspVvOUVBAuV2D2wK5tXshSCEjiFHc5qxWUFxtts.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
