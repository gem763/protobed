(AP) - Les Miles had some idea what Coastal Carolina has been dealing with this week as the Chanticleers prepared to visit Kansas while also preparing to face Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe school in Conway, South Carolina, was in the path of the storm as it churned toward the eastern seaboard. So early this week, Coastal Carolina coach Jamey Chadwell decided to pack his team in buses and headed inland - to Greenville and Clemson, among other places - for some practice before hopping a plane to Lawrence on Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s not unlike what Miles did in August 2005, when he was coaching LSU amid the impact of Hurricane Katrina. The Tigers wound up having to adjust to life away from the Gulf Coast.\n\n\u201cI wish them the very best,\u201d Miles said, \u201cbecause I know that they\u2019re traveling to enjoy the rest of their practice schedules, considering they\u2019ll have this time away from home and away from college.\u201d\n\nThe Chanticleers lost their opener 30-23 to Eastern Michigan, undone by penalties, turnovers and overall sloppy play. Getting those issues straightened out during a road trip forced by a hurricane?\n\nNot exactly an easy challenge.\n\n\u201cThe efficiency part of it makes it harder, but as far as doing the job or getting the things done you need to get done, we\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Chadwell said. \u201cYou work hard to get them in a routine, now you\u2019re out of it. How do we adjust to that? Then being the first time on the road. That\u2019s the biggest difference, when you have to evacuate. That\u2019s the biggest challenge in my opinion.\u201d\n\nStill, Chadwell said the Chanticleers aren\u2019t going to make excuses when they visit the Jayhawks, who needed a final-drive touchdown to avoid an upset loss of their own last week.\n\nIndiana State had them on the ropes with the lead in the closing minutes. Kansas needed to march 75 yards in hurry-up mode, and Carter Stanley needed to throw a clutch touchdown pass, to avoid a humiliating loss in Miles\u2018 return to the sideline.\n\nGiven that, Chadwell knows that Miles will have the Jayhawks prepared on Saturday.\n\nHe intends to do the same thing.\n\n\u201cCoach Miles is bringing a different mindset and mentality there,\u201d Chadwell said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got some quality players that he inherited. They\u2019re trying to be a mix, I believe, between a Big 12 team throwing it around but then also his SEC days. They\u2019re trying to line up and do some things, being physical and tough. He\u2019s got them really playing confident.\u201d\n\nHURRICANES NOT NEW\n\nThe Chanticleers had to evacuate last September, too, when Hurricane Florence hit. They spent 12 days on the road in North Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. With their hometown still flooded, players wound up spending another week in hotels in Myrtle Beach, keeping them away a full three weeks.\n\nPOOKA RETURNS\n\nTop playmaker Pooka Williams, who was suspended for the Jayhawks\u2019 opener for a series of off-field issues, will be in the backfield again Saturday. He ran for 1,125 yards and totaled 10 TDs last season, providing a big lift on both the ground and through the air.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to incorporate him into the team again,\u201d Miles said, \u201cand yet he\u2019ll give us some Pooka plays. We\u2019re looking forward to having him back. I can tell you that. He\u2019s enjoyed by his teammates. We\u2019ll enjoy him in the huddle.\u201d\n\nOTHERS GO MISSING\n\nJayhawks safety Shaq Richmond did not play last week after the senior was arrested on failure-to-appear charges. Then early Sunday, walk-on linebacker Tom Barrett was arrested on \u201csuspicion of contributing to a child\u2019s misconduct and displaying or possessing a fictitious ID.\u201d The school said it is gathering facts and would handle any discipline internally.\n\nOH-FOR-EVERYTHING\n\nCoastal Carolina is in its second full season as a member of the Football Bowl Subdivision, and it has never beaten a Power Five school. But the Chanticleers came close against Arkansas in 2017, when they lost 39-38 in Fayetteville. Their trip to Lawrence will mark their first game against Kansas.\n\nLES KNOWS\n\nSo what is a Chanticleer? Miles wasn\u2019t stumped.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rooster,\u201d the Jayhawks\u2019 coach said, \u201cthat handles the barnyard with real moxie, and tough and smart.\u201d The rooster is also a prominent character in Chaucer\u2019s \u201cCanterbury Tales.\u201d In fact, the school\u2019s mascot is named Chauncey the Chanticleer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Les Miles had some idea what Coastal Carolina has been dealing with this week as the Chanticleers prepared to visit Kansas while also preparing to face Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/31/indiana_st_kansas_football_58026_c0-143-3420-2137_s1770x1032.jpg?8be22c032b075db78bc6908830fa3a9c149eb6f0", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
