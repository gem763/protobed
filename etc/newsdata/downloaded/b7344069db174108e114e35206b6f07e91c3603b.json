Stackhouse represented Gallagher until mid-April, when he stepped down.\n\nVokey filed a lawsuit against Gallagher last month demanding $1 million in alleged unpaid legal fees, according to the complaint. Gallagher is seeking a declaratory judgment stating he doesn\u2019t owe any legal fees and that if fees should be rendered, then UAP should pay them \u2013 not Gallagher.\n\nNAVY SEAL EDDIE GALLAGHER SENTENCED TO REDUCED RANK, PARTIAL PAY, AFTER BEING CLEARED OF MURDER CHARGES\n\nGallagher, a 15-year Navy SEAL, was found not guilty of murdering an Islamic State (ISIS) fighter in Iraq in 2017, as well as charges of witness intimidation and assault. He was convicted on one count of taking a photo with a terrorist\u2019s corpse and was sentenced to reduced rank and partial pay.\n\nTim Parlatore joined the Navy SEAL's legal team in March and was Gallagher\u2019s lead defense attorney during his court-martial. Marc Mukasey, one of President Trump\u2019s personal attorneys, joined the legal team in April.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that it came to this,\u201d Parlatore told Fox News on Saturday. \u201cBut when attorneys and supposed nonprofits are taking advantage of our service members, they need to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nNAVY SEAL EDWARD GALLAGHER'S DEFENSE LAWYER WANTS TO REJOIN THE NAVY TO TEACH PROSECUTORS, SAYS HE FEARS FOR LAW-ABIDING WARFIGHTERS\n\nUAP says it \u201cgenerates public awareness and funds legal representation,\u201d according to its website. Gallagher's complaint alleges that \u201cUAP targets service members in need to use for their advertising campaigns, raising millions of dollars to line their pockets while providing very little to the actual legal representation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know who was committed to our family and we know who saw us a means to their own ends,\u201d Andrea Gallagher, Eddie Gallagher\u2019s wife, told Fox News on Saturday night. \u201cEddie and I firmly believe that the truth will be fully exposed.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nStackhouse told Fox News on Saturday that he had not been served with any papers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing it\u2019s come to this, but I\u2019m confident a court will sort it out in the most appropriate manner,\u201d he said.\n\nVokey did not return Fox News\u2019 request for comment.", "description": "Decorated\u00a0Navy SEAL\u00a0Eddie Gallagher, who was acquitted of\u00a0murder\u00a0in a\u00a0war crimes trial this past July, has\u00a0sued two of\u00a0his\u00a0former\u00a0lawyers and a military\u00a0legal defense nonprofit, according to\u00a0court documents filed\u00a0in\u00a0Texas\u00a0Friday.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/ContentBroker_contentid-2ff74600223c4d4a835f479cf13978bf.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
