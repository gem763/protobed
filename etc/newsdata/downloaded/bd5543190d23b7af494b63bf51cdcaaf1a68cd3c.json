Although the last was PSP game Logan\u2019s Shadow in 2007.\n\nThey\u2019ve also worked on a couple of portable Uncharted spin-offs, but it would certainly be a surprise if they were the ones to follow-up the end of an era finale to Uncharted 4.\n\nPerhaps the most important point is simply that whatever they are working on won\u2019t be out for a long while, so there\u2019ll be no Bend Studio game for the PlayStation 5\u2019s launch. Unless they do a remaster of Days Gone that is\u2026\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Days Gone review \u2013 the motorcycling dead\n\nMORE: Why bad reviews never hurt Days Gone \u2013 Reader\u2019s Feature\n\nMORE: Days Gone beats Mortal Kombat 11 for UK number one", "description": "Sony Bend Studio has begun development of a new project, but is it Days Gone 2, a new Syphon Filter, or something else?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DG_WT_Screens_9_1551085947-82b0_1571655375.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
