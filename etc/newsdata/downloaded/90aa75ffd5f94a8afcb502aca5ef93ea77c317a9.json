Mr. Pompeo said that Iran had launched \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s oil supply,\u201d although he did not offer any evidence and stopped short of saying that Iran had carried out the missile strikes.\n\nThe Houthis are part of a complex regional dynamic in the Middle East, receiving support from Iran while the Saudis, Tehran\u2019s chief rival for supremacy in the region and the leader of a coalition that is fighting the Houthis in Yemen, are aligned with the United States.\n\nSeyed Abbas Mousavi, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, castigated the Saudis for their role in the war in Yemen, where the Saudis have directed airstrikes that have caused heavy civilian casualties and exacerbated a humanitarian crisis. He also ridiculed Mr. Pompeo\u2019s comments.", "description": "Houthi rebels in Yemen said they carried out drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities.
