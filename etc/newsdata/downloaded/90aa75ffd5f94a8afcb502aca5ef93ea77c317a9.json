That would be consistent with an attack coming from the direction of the northern Persian Gulf, Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen, where the Iranian-backed Houthi militia that claimed responsibility for the strikes operates.\n\nAdministration officials, in a background briefing for reporters as well as in separate interviews on Sunday, also said a combination of drones and cruise missiles \u2014 \u201cboth and a lot of them,\u201d as one senior United States official put it \u2014 might have been used. That would indicate a degree of scope, precision and sophistication beyond the ability of the Houthi rebels alone.\n\nMr. Trump, however, did not name Iran, saying he needed to consult with Saudi Arabia first.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked,\u201d he said in a tweet on Sunday evening. \u201cThere is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d", "description": "The government released satellite images indicating, they said, that the strikes came from the direction of Iraq or Iran.", "authors": ["Eric Schmitt", "Farnaz Fassihi", "David D.
