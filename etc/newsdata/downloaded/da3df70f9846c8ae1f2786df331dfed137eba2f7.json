Her dream date is \u201ca high school English teacher who coaches the soccer team\u201d and \u201cloves karaoke.\u201d Brendan Gaughan is a 31-year-old data analyst for a federal agency. His dream date is \u201ca musician who can make me laugh who I can\u2019t keep my eyes off of.\u201d (Daniele Seiss/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn a stroke of what she called \"truly fortuitous timing,\" Sarah Pergolizzi, 31, got word that she'd been selected for Date Lab the day after the guy she'd been seeing broke up with her via text. Sarah has had a lot of false starts \u2014 she counts that recently adjourned relationship as her longest. It lasted two months. But the frustrations of dating have done nothing to diminish her spirit. If anything, she has learned to \"stop settling for stuff and making myself small just to be with anybody\" \u2014 and she continues to approach every potential romance wholeheartedly.\n\nSo it was with her whole heart that she entered Prather\u2019s on the Alley, where she met her date, Brendan Gaughan, 31. Brendan, who\u2019s been out of a three-year relationship for about two years now, said Sarah was immediately outgoing. She said he put her at ease. He said she was nice. She said he was cute. However, he hedged when pressed about instant attraction.\n\n\u201cI just knew it would be more of a friend thing fairly quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me it was: Just enjoy this, and thankfully she was a cool person and it was easy to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeisurely\u201d is how Sarah described their almost four-hour date. All the dishes they ordered they shared: apps of spicy Brussels sprouts and pork ribs; mains of grilled whole fish (dorade) and pappardelle with pork; and for dessert, a skillet cookie and a sundae with a berry compote. She drank prosecco, he had chardonnay.\n\nThey discussed Sarah\u2019s reexploration of faith after being a longtime atheist, as well as the government shutdown that occurred earlier this year. Both work for the federal government: She\u2019s a lawyer, he\u2019s a data analyst. But mostly, they talked books. \u201cWe\u2019re both avid readers, and we kind of nerded out and gave each other really good reading lists,\u201d said Sarah.\n\nYou could fill a small library with the books that were name-checked on the date. They discussed their shared love of Harry Potter and magical realism. They kicked about principles of \u201cscientifically based and not hokey\u201d self-help, according to Sarah. She recommended an armful of novels for him: Yaa Gyasi\u2019s \u201cHomegoing,\u201d Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cThe Shadow of the Wind,\u201d and Min Jin Lee\u2019s \u201cPachinko,\u201d among them. He suggested thinking-dude staples like George Saunders and Kurt Vonnegut.\n\n\n\nBrendan and Sarah. (Daniele Seiss/For The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the date, Sarah noticed a few things about Brendan that convinced her he\u2019s a good person. He asked the server his name so they could refer to him by it, and he welcomed a toddler who approached their table to blow out the candle sitting on it. It was the toddler\u2019s thing. (His parents had taken him to Prather\u2019s the night before, when he did his candle bit and peed on the floor \u2014 and they let him back in!) When Brendan came back from the bathroom, he grabbed the candle that was sitting outside of it so the child could blow out that one, too. Some might say Brendan was feeding his habit; Sarah called it \u201creally sweet.\u201d\n\nAfter the restaurant, they walked to the Metro. Upon saying goodbye, Brendan went in for a kiss, but Sarah pulled away, uncertain of where he was aiming. She immediately asked for a do-over. Brendan clarified his target: \u201cI meant to kiss you on the cheek.\u201d It \u201cwas a little mortifying,\u201d Sarah said.\n\nShe told him she\u2019d like to see him again, and he responded, \u201cOh yeah, you can take my number and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Instead, Sarah took the hint.\n\n\u201cI put my hand up and I said, \u2018If you\u2019re not interested you can tell me \u2014 I prefer honesty,\u2019 \u201d she recalled.\n\nSo, he was honest. \u201cI said, \u2018I would rather just be friends, but we can exchange numbers and talk about the craziness that this [Date Lab experience] is,\u2019 just to be cool about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI was upfront with her, and she was cool enough to make me feel comfortable enough to say it. I give her major credit.\u201d\n\nThey resolved not to pursue romance, but to form their own book club. Their first selection, they decided then and there, would be Michael Lewis\u2019s chronicle of the Trump administration, \u201cThe Fifth Risk.\u201d\n\nSarah gave no sign of hard feelings after being rebuffed; she had nothing but nice things to say about Brendan after the date, calling him \u201ccurious, kind, funny and smart.\u201d Mostly, she was happy for the chance to take her mind off things. \u201cAfter that breakup,\u201d she said, \u201cI really need a palate-cleanser, and it was just really nice.\u201d\n\nRate the date\n\nSarah: 5 [out of 5]. \u201cIt was great.\u201d\n\nBrendan: 5. \u201cShe was kind, she was down-to-earth, she gave me good book recommendations, and the food and drinks were amazing, the service was great.\u201d\n\nUpdate\n\nNot long after the date, they matched on Bumble. Sarah swiped right so she could say hi. Brendan unmatched and texted an apology, saying he didn\u2019t want her to get the wrong idea. Sarah said no problem and asked if he still wanted to go to a bookstore sometime, to which he did not respond. Brendan says he still plans to read the book and would be up for talking to her about it.\n\nRich Juzwiak is a writer in New York.\n\nMore from Date Lab:\n\nTheir attraction was immediate\n\nShe thought it went well until he said, \u2018Let\u2019s keep in touch\u2019\n\nDate Lab 2.0: Four new writers dig deeper to find out how the dates really went\n\nApply now to Date Lab", "description": "Would they form a book club for two?", "authors": ["Rich Juzwiak"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hoNHyJHfKFoGl0G-XDIPlRYbOEw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QCOEJFWQCAI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
