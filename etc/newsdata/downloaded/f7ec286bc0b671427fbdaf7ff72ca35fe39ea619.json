North Korea beat Lebanon 2-0 at home in the other Group H game.\n\nSon has warned that Turkmenistan, which is ranked 132nd in the world and has never qualified for the World Cup, should not be underestimated. He cited Tottenham\u2019s surprise 1-0 loss at home to Newcastle in the English Premier League last month as an example.\n\n\u201cKorea can\u2019t think of any opponent as a weak team,\u201d Son said. \u201cBreaking down a team that defends deep is not easy, as Tottenham found against Newcastle recently.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea needs to top the group, or finish as one of the four best runners-up in the eight groups, to progress to the next stage of Asian qualifying.\n\nChina is also set to open its campaign Tuesday, with newly-naturalized Brazilian-born player Elkeson hoping to contribute to a win over Maldives in Group A.\n\nThe Guangzhou Evergrande striker is now also known as Ai Kesen after receiving Chinese citizenship last month.\n\nBecoming the first player of non-Chinese heritage to be called up by the national team, the former Botafogo star has divided opinion in the country. But if he can score the goals to take China to a first World Cup since 2002, the doubters may be silenced. Most importantly, he has the full support of China\u2019s head coach Marcello Lippi.\n\n\u201cI spoke to Lippi some time ago about the possibility of playing for China and I\u2019m very happy the day has come,\u201d Elkeson said, adding that he has been made to feel very welcome by his teammates. \u201cI want to play my part for China.\u201d\n\nJapan, aiming for a seventh successive World Cup appearance, warmed up for its Group F opener against Myanmar with a 2-0 home win over Paraguay in Kashima.\n\nOnly four players on Japan\u2019s 23-man roster are based in the domestic league.\n\n\u201cWe have more players going overseas and playing in tougher environments, and I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Yuto Nagatomo, who plays for Galatasaray in Turkey. \u201cWithout players who can have success at the bigger clubs then Japanese soccer won\u2019t grow stronger.\u201d\n\nAustralia will start its campaign with a tricky trip to Kuwait, which trounced Nepal 7-0 in the opening game of Group B. Iran travels to Hong Kong for its first game, while 2022 World Cup host Qatar will be coming off a 6-0 win over Afghanistan when it takes on India, which lost its opening game at home to Oman.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Son Heung-min has called for his South Korea teammates to step it up as their campaign to qualify for a 10th successive World Cup kicks off on Tuesday in Turkmenistan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Duerden"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/aptopix_britain_soccer_premier_league_45194_c0-59-2183-1331_s1770x1032.jpg?4e3f664faea7e183dcd58b1e282f5cc635293ff0", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
