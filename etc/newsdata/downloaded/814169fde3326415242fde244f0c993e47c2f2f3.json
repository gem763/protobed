REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Illustration/File Photo\n\nIndia introduced new rules in February aimed at protecting the 130 million people dependent on small-scale retail by deterring big online discounts. The rules forced e-commerce firms to tweak their business structures and drew criticism from the United States, straining trade ties between New Delhi and Washington.\n\nWhile Amazon and Flipkart say they\u2019ve complied with the federal rules, local trader groups say the two companies are violating them by burning money to offer discounts - of more than 50% in some cases - during the ongoing festive sales.\n\nReuters reviewed emails and internal training material from Flipkart showing the company is in some cases offering to reduce, or forfeit, its sales commission from sellers that offer discounts.\n\nThe commerce ministry official told Reuters the government was reviewing complaints and evidence filed by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a group representing some 70 million brick-and-mortar retailers, alleging Amazon and Flipkart were violating the foreign investment rules.\n\nThe official declined to comment on possible action, but executives from Amazon and Flipkart were summoned to meet commerce ministry officials last week to discuss the matter.\n\nFlipkart in a statement said it had a \u201cgood meeting\u201d with government officials and it was \u201cdeeply committed to doing business the right way in India\u201d.\n\nAmazon said it had an \u201copen & transparent discussion\u201d with officials and has a high bar for compliance.\n\nSeeking to attract shoppers around the key Hindu festival of Diwali, both retailers have placed full-page advertisements in top national daily the Times of India to showcase discount offerings stretching from Samsung and Apple phones to clothing and diapers.\n\n\u201cCustomers are going online because of the unbelievable discounts. Because of this sales at offline businesses are down 30% to 40% this month,\u201d CAIT\u2019s secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said.\n\nFLIPKART INCENTIVES\n\nTwo emails received by Flipkart sellers in September, just days ahead of the inaugural phase of the festive sales, showed it offering to partly fund discounts.\n\nThe company would \u201cburn\u201d 3% of the discount if a seller lowered a product price by 15%, or 9% if the seller discounted by 30%, said one of the emails.\n\nIn training material posted on Flipkart\u2019s restricted website for its sellers, seen by Reuters, the company asks them to prepare for the festive season by saying \u201cnothing is bigger than this\u201d and explaining how they can benefit by discounting products for Flipkart\u2019s premium customers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Packages traveling along a conveyor belt are reflected in a mirror inside of an Amazon fulfillment center in Robbinsville, New Jersey, U.S., November 27, 2017.
