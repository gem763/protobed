Landi Burns, however, has her own ways of measuring the success of her resort. Among other things, she keeps an eye on how often she has to order new Monopoly sets.\n\n\u201cWe have to replace them a lot, they get used so much,\u201d she says happily. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s what it is all about.\u201d\n\nBoard games are not usually considered the cutting-edge of luxury. But at Turtle Island, the Fijian hideaway which Burns manages with her husband Rob, they do things differently. At this top-tier resort, which has deliberately chosen not to offer in-room Wi-Fi, board games have become one indicator of how guests are unwinding.\n\nDoing nothing is by far the most popular activity on Turtle Island.\n\n\u201cThis place is about disconnecting to reconnect,\u201d Burns says, explaining why the resort has resisted pressure to provide unfettered access to Wi-Fi. \u201cPeople come to connect: with their partner, with the staff, with other guests.\u201d Instead of gazing into their phones, Burns want guests to get involved, whether it\u2019s a game of Monopoly or something else. \u201cListen to the birds, go for a swim, read a book, talk to your partner.\u201d\n\nIt is an unusual approach, but Turtle Island has always done things its own way. Four decades after American entrepreneur Richard Evanson opened this private island to paying guests, it remains one of Fiji\u2019s premier hideaways. The idyllic location in the Yasawa Islands is one obvious attraction; so are the all-inclusive rate and limited guest numbers \u2013 there are just 14 sprawling bures on an island that has 12 private beaches. Other aspects of the experience are, well, unexpected.\n\nWhile contemporary resorts are usually designed to encourage cocooning, providing ever-more extravagant villas in which guests can hide away, Turtle Island takes a different tack. Here, meals have always been served communally at one long table and the only menu you will ever see is at breakfast, when you can choose between ever-changing options such as Indian spiced eggs, shrimp omelette or parfait cinnamon yoghurt with papaya compote. Lunch features shared platters, while dinner is a set three-course feast. In the mood for a romantic evening for two? Staff will set you up at one of a number of private dining locations, perhaps on a beach or atop a cliff.\n\nBy contrast, Fiji\u2019s newer resorts \u2013 including recent openings such as Lang Walker\u2019s Kokomo and the South Pacific\u2019s first Six Senses resort \u2013 have taken a more indulgent approach, with villas kitted out with private pools and on-trend touches such as kombucha cocktails, gluten-free bakeries and open-air cinemas.\n\nLife on Turtle Island is somewhat simpler. Guests can go snorkelling and horse riding or savour a spa treatment, but by far the most popular activity is doing nothing much: just hanging out in the alfresco bar, on the loungers and hammocks in front of the bures, or on a private beach (each equipped with a sign that can be flipped from Vacant to Occupied to warn off others).", "description": "Turtle Island has turned relaxation into an unusual fine art that\u2019s been luring guests for four decades.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2719%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_116/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fce90444c383c049a681934bcb6d6b4df94a74f6", "published_at": "2019-08-06"}
