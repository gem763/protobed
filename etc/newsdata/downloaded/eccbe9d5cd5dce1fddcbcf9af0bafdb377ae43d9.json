It is also a source of public grievances,\" Lam said in her speech on Wednesday, adding that housing was \"fundamental to social harmony and stability\".\n\n\"I learned that young professionals, with monthly salaries in the tens of thousands, are frustrated by the fact that they are unable to buy flats from the private housing market when market prices are often over 10,000 Hong Kong dollars [$1,275] per square foot [0.09sq metres],\" Lam added.\n\nLam promised that 10,000 transitional housing units will be built over the next three years for people waiting for public housing. The government will also offer rent subsidies for those waiting for public rental flats and make it easier for first-time buyers to raise mortgages.\n\nHong Kong is one of the most densely packed places in the world [Umit Bektas/Reuters]\n\nShe said the issue of land supply has to be addressed and the government will take back private land for public housing. The government has already identified three kinds of sites: 450 hectares of abandoned farmland, lands with stalled public housing projects and seven hectares from three urban squatters' villagers.\n\nHong Kong is one of the most densely packed places in the world.\n\n'Political standstill'\n\nBut Lam could face a tough time pushing her proposals through given the depth of opposition she faces in the legislature.\n\nTommy Wu, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, says Lam will not be able to make many \"concrete economic policies given the political standstill\".\n\nLam's approval ratings have been at record lows for months, and on Thursday she was heckled again by opposition legislators at a Legislative Council session, forcing her to once again delay making her statements.\n\nPro-democracy politicians interrupted Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam for a second day on Thursday in the Legislative Council [October 17: Umit Bektas/Reuters]\n\n\"Spending more money at the current juncture probably won't help the economy much given the poor sentiment and ongoing protests,\" Wu told Al Jazeera.\n\nLam also confirmed on Wednesday what many economists have been predicting: That the territory's economy shrank in the June-to-September quarter, extending the 0.4 percent contraction in the preceding quarter, technically leaving Hong Kong in a recession. Official third-quarter economic figures are due to be released on October 31.\n\nSigns of the economic slowdown are all around Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong's retail sector has declined more than during the downturn caused by the outbreak of the SARS virus in 2003, according to real estate adviser Savills.\n\nShop rents are down 54 percent from 2013. Warehouse rents have fallen for the first time since 2016.\n\nOfficial figures showed that retail sales fell by 23 percent in August compared with the same month last year.\n\nSome 100 restaurants have shut down, affecting around 2,000 staff, according to Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po.\n\n'Too little, too late'\n\nSome observers say that even if Lam's proposals are implemented, they are unlikely to help Hong Kong's poorest.\n\n\"Too little, too late. It was not addressing the real issues,\" Johnson Yeung, a protestor and a member of the executive committee of Amnesty International's Hong Kong division, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYeung says that some of the measures proposed are counterproductive.\n\n\"She had already promised to increase housing supply when she was elected,\" he said. \"That's a long time away and will not help with the immediate situation.\"\n\nYeung also believes that the government should take back land only from big property developers, instead of from the poor in squatters' villages. Lam's proposal would see both developers and squatters losing land.\n\nHong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam faces intense opposition to her plans to boost Hong Kong's economy [Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters]\n\nIn fact, the shares of property developers like New World Development, Henderson Land Development and CK Asset Holdings Limited surged on Thursday as investors bet that Lam's moves would actually raise property prices, making it even harder for many ordinary people to buy homes.\n\nNg Wai-Tung, a community organiser at the Society for Community Organization (SoCO), a nongovernmental organisation, agrees that Lam's land acquisitions and rent subsidies will do little to curb prices.\n\n\"Landlords are still free to raise rents. If rents increase, people cannot afford them, so it doesn't solve the problem,\" Ng, who has worked with the city's homeless for more than two decades, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOthers also believe that raising the limits of how much people can borrow will also be counterproductive.\n\n\"This will actually raise housing prices. If people are allowed to borrow more, then landlords will see reason to bring prices up,\" Yeung said. \"[Lam]'s not helping the general public if she does not dare to confront the big land developers.\"\n\n\"Without a concrete response to the [protestors'] five demands, using housing to calm down the situation is wishful thinking.\"", "description": "Unaffordable housing may be fuelling violent protests, but critics say Lam's measures could make property even pricier.", "authors": ["David Ho", "About The Author"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/b7d1ce9b16e84436810e61aff9b2f009_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
