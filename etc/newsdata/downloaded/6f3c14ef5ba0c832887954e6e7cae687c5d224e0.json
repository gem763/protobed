USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The House Judiciary Committee won access Friday to the grand jury evidence behind special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report about Russian interference in the 2016 election, a key federal court test about the legitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., had argued that the panel needed to review the evidence that Attorney General William Barr redacted from the report in order to review possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump during Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nBut the Justice Department had argued that the committee wasn\u2019t entitled to grand jury evidence, which typically remains secret, because the panel failed to explain how the access would help its investigation. The White House has refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry for lack of a House vote to authorize it.\n\nHouse Republicans also argued that the committee didn\u2019t deserve the evidence because the full House hadn\u2019t voted to authorize an impeachment inquiry. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24 and said no vote is necessary.\n\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, the chief judge of the D.C. district, granted the committee\u2019s request for grand jury evidence Friday after reviewing the arguments Oct. 8 and all of the court filings.\n\n\"The Department of Justice claims that existing law bars disclosure to the Congress of grand jury information,\" Howell wrote in a 75-page decision. \"DOJ is wrong.\"\n\nHowell ordered the Justice Department to disclose by Oct. 30 all portions of Mueller\u2019s report that were redacted because of grand jury evidence and underlying exhibits that dealt with the evidence. After the review, the committee could submit further requests for additional grand jury material, Howell said in the two-page ruling.\n\n\"The White House\u2019s stated policy of non-cooperation with the impeachment inquiry weighs heavily in favor of disclosure,\" Howell wrote. \"Congress\u2019s need to access grand jury material relevant to potential impeachable conduct by a President is heightened when the Executive Branch willfully obstructs channels for accessing other relevant evidence.\"\n\nThe decision was considered a key test of the House impeachment effort, as the chamber seeks to enforce subpoenas for testimony and documents from the administration. Several House committees have lawsuits pending and on appeal seeking Trump's tax returns, other financial documents and subpoenas for administration officials.\n\nNadler said he was gratified the federal court ruled in the committee's favor.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s thoughtful ruling recognizes that our impeachment inquiry fully comports with the Constitution and thoroughly rejects the spurious White House claims to the contrary,\" Nadler said in a statement. \"This grand jury information that the administration has tried to block the House from seeing will be critical to our work.\u201d\n\nTrump has vowed to fight all of the investigation's subpoenas because he considers it illegitimate and a partisan \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"The reality is that DOJ and the White House have been openly stonewalling the House\u2019s efforts to get information by subpoena and by agreement, and the White House has flatly stated that the Administration will not cooperate with congressional requests for information,\" Howell wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMueller\u2019s 22-month investigation found no conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, despite that country's sweeping and systematic effort to influence the 2016 election. But the report released in April outlined potential obstruction when Trump tried to thwart the special counsel inquiry and have Mueller removed. Mueller made no decision about whether to charge Trump with obstruction because Justice Department policy forbids charging a president while in office.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee subpoenaed grand jury evidence to explore Trump\u2019s knowledge of Russian efforts to interfere in the election, the president\u2019s knowledge of potential criminal acts by his campaign or administration, and actions taken by former White House counsel Don McGahn. The Mueller report described episodes when Trump directed McGahn to remove the special counsel, which McGahn ignored.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued in legal filings that a \u201cminuscule\u201d 0.1% of the Mueller report dealing with potential obstruction of justice was redacted. And the department said releasing the evidence could hurt pending cases that grew out of the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe top Republican on the committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, also filed an argument in the case urging the judge to reject the request. Collins said that Congress sometimes deserves access to grand jury evidence but that the Judiciary Committee shouldn't gain access yet, for lack of a full House vote.\n\nMore about the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump:\n\n'We're fighting all the subpoenas.'
