As Paul Hendrickson puts it in his new book, \u201cPlagued by Fire: The Dreams and Furies of Frank Lloyd Wright,\u201d the man in the cape and the wide-brimmed porkpie was \u201csuch a fantastic fabricator\u201d on his own behalf \u201cthat it\u2019s become something of a cliche among his chroniclers to say he barely grasped the basic concept of truth telling.\u201d Also well known, at least among the architecture set, are \u201cthe vulgar narcissism and arrogance and bombast and egocentrism and reckless financial \u2014 not to say moral \u2014 ways\u201d of this self-proclaimed, and yet actual, genius.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat may sound off-putting. Aren\u2019t we contending with enough high-profile narcissism these days? But readers of this biography will begin to see these things as only part of a complex self. As he did in his last book, \u201cHemingway\u2019s Boat,\u201d Hendrickson, a former Washington Post reporter, employs tremendously rigorous research to interrogate the myths that hang around his larger-than-life subject. His is not an effort to exonerate (or make excuses for the bad behavior of yet another white male artist!) but to dig deeply into who Frank Lloyd Wright really was.\n\n\u201cSo much of his history was attended by the gothic and the tragic, encircled by it, pursued by it,\u201d writes Hendrickson, who lays his narrative foundation with a horrific event from Wright\u2019s life. In 1914, Wright was already well known. He had built the homes that would come to exemplify the Prairie style, as well as the jewel-box-like Unity Temple in Oak Park, Ill. Five years had passed since he had abandoned his wife, Kitty Tobin, and their children, for Mamah Borthwick Cheney, the wife of a client. The scandal had played out in all the newspapers, in which Wright came off as obtuse and entitled, if not morally bankrupt. He\u2019d since established some calm at his Taliesin estate in Spring Green, Wis. But on Aug. 15 of that year, while Wright was in Chicago, this new life was destroyed: A crazed servant named Julian Carlton set fire to Wright\u2019s residence and murdered Cheney, her two young children and four others with a shingling ax.\n\nWhat can a person do after such a thing? And where can a biographer go? In Hendrickson\u2019s case the answer is wherever the search for Wright\u2019s psyche leads him. The title of this book refers not only to the terrible ways in which literal fire kept coming after Wright in the years that followed, but the extent to which he was burned by the events of his life and sometimes by his own actions.\n\nThis thick volume is not meant to serve as an introduction to Wright or his artistic trajectory \u2014 his relationship to Japanese aesthetics, for example, or the Arts and Crafts movement, or larger Modernist forces. (I suspect Hendrickson himself might recommend the slimmer \u201cFrank Lloyd Wright: A Life\u201d by the late great critic Ada Louise Huxtable for that purpose.) That is not to say that it doesn\u2019t cover Wright\u2019s notable projects or his notions about \u201corganic architecture\u201d with a great deal of attention and care. If anything, the author overdoes it, parsing too many chronologies and splitting too many hairs with previous Wright biographers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Hendrickson\u2019s persistent and expansive curiosity, which has driven books on the Vietnam era and the American South, among other subjects, also takes readers beyond Wright in important, revelatory ways. No man \u2014 no self-indulgent designer of handsome spaces \u2014 is an island, and a lot of effort here goes into learning about other human beings, many of whom were beset by their own troubles: family members, clients and even the insane, murderous Julian Carlton. And so Wright\u2019s narrative becomes part of a larger story that also involves the Great Migration, the horror of the Tulsa Race Riot, the legacy of the Transcendentalists, the tradition of the New England pulpit and the beginning of suburban sprawl. What this suggests: There is no American life that isn\u2019t bound up with our larger cultural history.\n\n\u201cIf harmony and order were his great artistic ideals,\u201d Hendrickson says, \u201cWright could find little of them in his own debt-plagued, scandal-wracked, death-haunted history.\u201d Passing through his darknesses makes you see his buildings, and all that flow, beauty and light, in a new way.\n\nJohn Glassie is the author of \u201cA Man of Misconceptions: The Life of an Eccentric in an Age of Change.\u201d\n\nPLAGUED BY FIRE\n\nThe Dreams and Furies of Frank Lloyd Wright\n\nBy Paul Hendrickson\n\nKnopf. 624 pp. $35\n\nAD", "description": "Paul Hendrickson\u2019s biography \u201cPlagued by Fire\u201d is an exhaustive attempt to understand the architectural genius.", "authors": ["John Glassie"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/G0SXz6JLeeZMMk6dm9Xrronh7hY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DX4FWQHBJ4I6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
