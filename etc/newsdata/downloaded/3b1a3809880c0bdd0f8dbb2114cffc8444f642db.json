Twitter, do your thing.\"\n\nShortly afterwards, an account apparently belonging to Fletcher replied by saying: \"Hi Doris. Thank you and sorry.\n\n\"It's great to hear you're still performing,\" he added.\n\n\"No apology necessary,\" replied Pearson - although, in a separate tweet, she admitted the band had been upset by his tirade at the time.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\n\n\"Was taken aback by it,\" she told one fan. \"We were really young and worked so hard for years. Of course nobody wants to hear someone say their work is awful.\n\n\"Now I look at it completely differently and find the whole thing hilarious!\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @TheDorisPearson Was taken aback by it, we were really young and worked so hard for years. Of course nobody wants to hear someone say their work is awful.\n\n\n\nNow I look at it completely differently and find the whole thing hilarious! \ud83d\ude18 \u2014 Doris Pearson (@TheDorisPearson) September 19, 2019 Report\n\nPearson later invited her former nemesis to join her on an \"[expletive] crap night out\".\n\nHe declined, telling one fan: \"Doris would probably throw her drink over me and rightfully so.\"\n\nFletcher also turned down several requests to speak to the media.\n\n\"An interview with Doris would be much more constructive,\" he reasoned. \"She's still creative and actually bringing something to this world.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Pearson said she was \"in complete shock\".\n\n\"To be reunited with Eliot and receive an apology from him was completely unexpected.\n\n\"At least it's defused any animosity between him and the fabulous Five Star fans, as a lot of them were still upset about it.\n\n\"The last thing I'd want is for anyone to get into a fight over it.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Five Star (L-R): Stedman, Denise, Doris, Lorraine and Delroy Pearson\n\nFive Star were one of the biggest British pop bands of the mid-80s, selling more than 15 million records worldwide, with hits like System Addict, Rain Or Shine and The Slightest Touch.\n\nFormed by five siblings - Doris, Denise, Lorraine, Delroy and Stedman Pearson - they were dubbed Romford's answer to the Jacksons, and won best British group at the 1987 Brit Awards.\n\nTheir fateful appearance on Going Live came as they promoted the single With Every Heartbeat. Fletcher was quickly cut off, as the band giggled with shock.\n\nHost Sarah Greene quickly moved on, cueing up the next caller by asking: \"Have you got a sensible question?\"\n\nThe clip has frequently appeared in lists of the top television moments of the 80s, and musicians' most calamitous TV appearances.\n\n\"I'm surprised people still remembered it,\" Pearson told the BBC.\n\nAlthough the clip became notorious, it didn't help the band's chart fortunes. With Every Heartbeat stalled at number 49.\n\nAfter relocating to America, Five Star disbanded in 1995, but have frequently reunited to perform at 80s nostalgia shows.\n\nDenise Pearson, who sang lead vocals on their biggest hits, went on to star in Thriller Live and auditioned for The Voice UK in 2012.\n\nThey are about to release a three-disc retrospective to mark the 35th anniversary of their debut album, Luxury of Life.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
