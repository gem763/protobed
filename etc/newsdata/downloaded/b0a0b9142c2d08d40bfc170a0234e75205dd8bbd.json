It is going to be sold at auction next month\n\nThe vehicle will certainly stand out next to raft of beautiful classic motors being sold at the auction.\n\nThis includes a 1961 Aston Martin DB4GT and a 1935 Bugatti Type 57, which are both estimated to achieve significant seven-figure sums.\n\nBut the FL6 box truck is likely to steal the show, attracting the interest of art collectors as well as vintage car enthusiasts.\n\nBanksy created the masterpiece back in 2000 - back when he was a relative unknown and hadn't been recognised for his satirical street paintings and subversive epigrams.\n\nThe anonymous artist was asked to paint the truck - which normally would be worth little more than \u00a31,000 on today's market - during a warehouse party for New Year in Spain to celebrate the millennium as part of the Turbozone International Circus.\n\nAfter spraying the initial layers of paint on stage and under spotlights during the party, Banksy completed the truck over the next two weeks.\n\nThe truck will go under the hammer at the Goodwood revival sale on 14 September. Experts predict it will reach \u00a31m-\u00a31.5m\n\nThe images on the truck show the silhouette of a male figure swinging a hammer towards metal cogs\n\nThe anonymous artist was asked to paint the truck during a warehouse party for a New Year's party in 2000 in Spain to celebrate the millennium as part of the Turbozone International Circus\n\nOfficially called Turbo Zone Truck (Laugh Now But One Day We\u2019ll Be in Charge), it showcases an early example of the artist\u2019s now famed calls for anarchy and social change that have made him a household name.\n\nThe images on the truck show the silhouette of a male figure swinging a hammer towards metal cogs.\n\nThe background depicts flying monkeys and red stars with the word \u2018circus\u2019 stencilled across the back end of the truck.\n\nThe reverse side of the Volvo shows a group of soldiers - which have been focal points of his other work since - running away from a cannon.\n\nThe title of the piece is stencilled above the soldier\u2019s heads with \u2018charge\u2019 in large letters.\n\nThe truck was used by the circus to tour Europe and South America. It is well known for its extreme stunts and pyrotechnics\n\nThe automotive masterpiece was created back when Banksy was a relative unknown and hadn't yet become a household name famed for satirical street paintings and subversive epigrams\n\nThe 1988 Volvo box truck would normally be worth little more than \u00a31,000 on today's market\n\nRalph Taylor, Bonhams Global Head of Post-War and Contemporary Art, said, 'Banksy is arguably the most important artist to have emerged since the millennium and this, his largest commercial work, represents a new high watermark of quality for works of his to appear at auction.\n\n'The composition bears all the hallmarks of this peerless agent provocateur. Bonhams is thrilled to have the opportunity to continue offering the best of his work at auction as we have done consistently for well over a decade.'\n\nAfter completion, the truck was used by Mojo Fellner, the co-founder of the circus - which is known for it's incredible stunts and pyrotechnics - to tour Europe and South America.\n\nThis side of the Volvo shows a group of soldiers - which have been focal points of his other work since - running away from a cannon\n\nAfter spraying the initial layers of paint on stage and under spotlights during the party, Banksy completed the truck over the next two weeks\n\nSpeaking about the Banksy-graffiti truck, Bonhams spokesman said the auction house was 'thrilled to have the opportunity to continue offering the best of his work'\n\nIt will be offered by the auction house at a sale at the Goodwood estate in West Sussex during the Goodwood Revival next month.\n\nBonhams have placed an estimate of \u00a31million to \u00a31.5million on the one-off HGV.\n\nThe auction house will hope there won't be a repeat of the Banksy 'Girl with Balloon' painting fiasco last year, when the piece of art shred itself moments after it was sold at auction for over \u00a31million.\n\nAnd this is not the first Banky vehicle to go to auction: Bonhams also sold a Banksy SWAT van in June 2016, which he'd created for his break out Barely Legal show in Los Angeles.\n\nIt was sold in London for \u00a3218,500 - less than a sixth of what the Volvo truck is predicted to go for.\n\nThe unique vehicle will be sold by the auction house on the Goodwood estate in West Sussex during the Goodwood Revival next month\n\nThe background depicts flying monkeys leaping over a television, one with a spanner in his hands", "description": "The 1988 Volvo FL6 HGV is covered in graffiti by the iconic street artist Banksy, and is believed to be his largest piece of work in existence.
