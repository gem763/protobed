The group now plans roughly $100 million to give its founders 5x more capital to play with.\n\nEach founder is allotted 15% carry in his or her fund, while Spearhead holds on to 5%. This time around, says Spearhead\u2019s Jeff Fagnan, standout \u201cleads,\u201d or those tapped to deploy capital from the fund, will also have the opportunity to receive another $10 million to invest at the end of the two-year program during a culminating demo day-like event.\n\nSpearhead is designed to train founders, who tend to be well-connected to the tech ecosystem and knowledgeable about startups, to be effective angel investors. Previous Spearhead leads include Shippo co-founder and chief executive officer Laura Behrens Wu, Scale AI founder and CEO Alex Wang and Rippling co-founder and chief technology officer Prasanna Sankar. To date, 35 founders have completed the program.\n\nApplications to join Spearhead\u2019s third cohort will become available this week. Those who participate will be encouraged to write checks at the pre-seed stage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s starting to be gap opening up again at the pre-seed,\u201d Fagnan tells TechCrunch. \u201cFounders are the right way to fill that gap. Founders backing their most talented friends \u2026 founders backing founders is the right way for this to go. We need to redefine who thinks of themselves as an angel investor.\u201d\n\nTo be eligible to become a Spearhead lead, you must live in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston or New York City and run, or very recently have run, a startup. The firm plans to accept around 15 applicants.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to build an active community within the leads and we\u2019ve found smaller equals better; fewer people coming together and taking deeper accountability,\u201d Fagnan said.\n\nSpearhead leads can invest their capital in any tech startups, so long as there\u2019s no existing equity relationship. Existing Spearhead investments include ZeroDown, Altitude Networks, Scythe, Airgarage, Cloosiv, Height, O.School, PopSQL, Superplastic and Sword Health.", "description": "Applications to Spearhead's third cohort open this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1003390008.jpg?w=600", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
