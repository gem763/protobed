This week, the Trump administration further ratcheted up pressure on Iran, announcing a reward program to disrupt Tehran's financial operations as well as confirming it had offered to pay tanker captains if they helped the United States impound Iranian vessels carrying Iranian oil and unveiling a new wave of sanctions.", "description": "US national security adviser John Bolton on Friday shared a satellite image of an Iranian tanker off the coast of Syria, after the Iranian government denied that it was the vessel's final destination.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180517121909-01-john-bolton-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
