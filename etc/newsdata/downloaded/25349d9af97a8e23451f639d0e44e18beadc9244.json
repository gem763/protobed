This situation went way beyond my feelings for Barca.\u201d\n\nMessi added that he felt he was made an example of by the Spanish tax authorities, who stepped up their efforts against tax fraud after Spain\u2019s deep economic crisis hit.\n\n\u201cI was the first and that\u2019s why they came down so hard on me. They made an example of me and showed that it was going to be like this for everyone. It was tough because of everything that was happening at that time,\u201d he said.\n\n($1 = 0.9112 euros)", "description": "Barcelona captain Lionel Messi has said he considered leaving the club when was investigated for tax fraud in 2013, saying he felt \"badly treated\" by Spain.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438783556&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980R1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
