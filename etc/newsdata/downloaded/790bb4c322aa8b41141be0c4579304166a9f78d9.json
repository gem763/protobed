He joins a crowd of sweaty, barely clothed revelers, writhing shirtless as both women and men caress his chiseled torso.\n\nWhile Styles\u2019 2017 solo debut album had a 1970s vibe, the soulful \u201cLights Up\u201d signals a new, R&B-driven direction for the singer. Although the former One Direction star has never publicly identified with any particular label, many fans interpreted \u201cLights Up\u201d as confirmation of his long-rumored bisexuality.\n\nSome pointed to the song\u2019s lyrics, which hint at embracing one\u2019s true self, as proof. \u201cLights up and they know who you are,\u201d Styles sings, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not ever going back.\u201d\n\nOthers suggested that the song\u2019s release on Oct. 11, which happens to be National Coming Out Day, wasn\u2019t a mere coincidence.\n\nok but harry styles dropping a low key bisexual bop on national coming out day? icon \u2014 Matt Bellassai (@MattBellassai) October 11, 2019\n\ncultural impact:\n\n\n\n\u2588\n\n\u2588\n\n\u2588\n\n\u2588\n\n\u2588 \uff3f\n\nHarry styles Everything else\n\nreleasing a bi\n\nanthem on national\n\ncoming out day pic.twitter.com/1h3D8vepWQ \u2014 sahabia LIGHTS UP (@ftdtomlinson_) October 11, 2019\n\nHarry released a video on national coming out day and he\u2019s dancing and grinding up against men and women all sweaty and the song is slow yet sexy. Harry Styles invented big dick energy & that\u2019s final I don\u2019t wanna hear anything else ! \u2014 Nica (@7Osharry) October 11, 2019\n\nThe 25-year-old has emerged as an outspoken LGBTQ rights advocate in recent years, and he has appeared in concert with rainbow and transgender pride flags draped over his shoulders.\n\nOne of his earlier songs, \u201cMedicine,\u201d also seemed to hint at bisexuality. Though Styles has never released an official version of the track, unprofessionally filmed clips from a 2018 concert in Switzerland appeared to capture him singing, \u201cThe boys and the girls are here. I mess around with them, and I\u2019m OK with it.\u201d\n\nStyles has only publicly dated women in the past, and he\u2019s been romantically linked to Taylor Swift and Kendall Jenner.\n\nBack in 2013, he told British GQ, \u201cBisexual? Me? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Since then, however, he\u2019s taken a much less rigid approach. He told The Sun\u2019s Dan Wootton in 2017 that he has \u201cnever felt the need\u201d to use a label. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s something I\u2019ve ever felt like I have to explain about myself,\u201d he said. But in August, he told Rolling Stone, \u201cI want to make people feel comfortable being whatever they want to be. Maybe at a show you can have a moment of knowing that you\u2019re not alone.\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m not trying to say, \u2018I understand what it\u2019s like,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make people feel included and seen.\u201d Watch the full \u201cLights Up\u201d video below:", "description": "The former One Direction star is caressed by both women and men in the video, leading many to interpret it as a statement about his sexuality.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da097292100005009acd075.png?cache=ij56bhjrzr&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
