DeLoache Williams looks back at their first meeting and sees the bitter irony in the club\u2019s name. Theirs was a fast friendship that burned bright in the nightclubs and cocktail bars of Manhattan, but pulled DeLoache Williams into one of the most infamous New York City society scandals in recent years. Her friend had conned celebrities into believing she was worth an estimated $67 million.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t extraordinary,\u201d DeLoache Williams recalls. \u201cHer voice was high-pitched and she was smiley. She was choosy about who she spoke to, but she was much like other people I had met in New York.\u201d\n\nAnna Delvey\u2019s real name was Anna Sorokin. She was not a German heiress, but a Russian con artist and grifter. Her favorite movie was \u2018Mean Girls.\u2019\n\nSorokin said she was a German heiress who wanted to start a \u201cmembership club experience\u201d for artists and had interned at Purple Magazine. She was living in a hotel room at The Standard Highline at the time, and had more than 40,000 followers on Instagram FB, +2.31% . DeLoache Williams, then a photo editor at Vanity Fair, wasn\u2019t impressed by social-media clout \u2014 she was used to working with boldfaced names and celebrities. But there was a vulnerability and gentleness to Sorokin that drew her in.\n\nShe did notice weird things about Sorokin, too. \u201cShe was demanding and rude to waitstaff,\u201d DeLoache Williams said. \u201cShe did not say \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018thank you.\u2019 When an elevator opened, she wouldn\u2019t wait for other people to get off.\u201d\n\nSimon & Schuster Rachel DeLoache Williams.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: My mother stole my identity and racked up $500,000 in debt\n\nDespite her social-media following and ability to attract dinner-party guests like actor Macaulay Culkin, Anna was not what she seemed. Her real name was Anna Sorokin and she came from a working-class family in Domodedovo, a satellite town in the southeast of Moscow. Her father was a truck driver and her mother worked at a convenience store.\n\nSorokin was a con artist and grifter, DeLoache Williams would later discover when she opened the New York Post NWSA, +2.43% after their friendship ended \u2014 and after being scammed out of $62,000 for a vacation at a $7,000-a-night resort in Marrakesh and flights there and back. Sorokin\u2019s favorite movie was \u201cMean Girls,\u201d according to her childhood friend in Russia.\n\n\u2018She was demanding and rude to wait staff. She did not say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d When an elevator opened, she wouldn\u2019t wait for other people to get off.\u2019 \u2014Rachel DeLoache Williams on her former friend, fake heiress Anna Sorokin\n\n\u201cHer behavior mirrored that cliquish, elitist culture and society,\u201d DeLoache Williams said. While Sorokin\u2019s behavior was sometimes odd, she never suspected that her friend was an impostor: \u201cI rationalized a lot of her behavior and made up backstories when I didn\u2019t have explanations.\u201d\n\nSorokin, now 28, was arrested in October 2017 and sentenced in May to four to 12 years in prison. Judge Diane Kiesel said Sorokin had been \u201cblinded by the glitter and glamour of New York City.\u201d \u201cI am stunned by the depth of the defendant\u2019s deception,\u201d the judge added.\n\nSorokin was convicted of multiple counts of larceny and theft. She had falsified bank records and applied for a $22 million loan to fund a private arts club. She was turned down, but did receive a $100,000 loan from one bank. Kiesel ordered Sorokin to pay nearly $200,000 in restitution and a $24,000 fine.\n\nRachel DeLoache Williams Anna Sorokin in happier times during her time posing as fake German heiress \u2018Anna Delvey.\u2019\n\nMarketWatch spoke to DeLoache Williams, the author of \u201cMy Friend Anna: The True Story of a Fake Heiress,\u201d about how her former friend scammed her out of tens of thousands of dollars:\n\nMarketWatch: What attracted her to you as a friend?\n\nDeLoache Williams: She was fun, spontaneous. I thought she was smart. Her foundation was fun to talk about. It was going to have multi-disciplinary pop-up events. She knew what artists were doing where and when. She clearly fooled enough banks and hedge funds that I believed her with her foundation plans.\n\nMarketWatch: Looking back, did you ignore any red flags?\n\nDeLoache Williams: I never saw telltale signs to tell me this person was an impostor, or living a lie. Mostly, I noticed things like entitlement and rudeness. Anna did say things like, \u201cIt\u2019s all going to work out for me or all go terribly wrong.\u201d I took that to mean she was referring to her art-foundation project. The time we spent together was a little over two months. I spent two years following that little blip in my life, trying to reckon with it.\n\n\u2018Both of my parents are clinical psychologists and I was aware that she was troubled, but I wanted to be a good friend to her.\u2019 \u2014Rachel DeLoache Williams on her former friend, fake heiress Anna Sorokin\n\nShe had had a falling out with a girl when I met her. It had to do with her insensitivity. Not money. She delivered some bad news to that friend, a really hurtful piece of information. It has to do with a relationship. I believe it was related to her sociopathy. She didn\u2019t have empathy for that person and she wasn\u2019t able to empathize.\n\nBoth of my parents are clinical psychologists and I was aware that she was troubled, but I wanted to be a good friend to her.\n\nMarketWatch: This friendship has some important lessons, particularly for romantic relationships.\n\nDeLoache Williams: I do think some of these lessons translate into romantic relationships, especially if you are projecting onto somebody who you want them to be. People show you who they are through their actions.\n\nMarketWatch: How did you rationalize her behavior?\n\nDeLoache Williams: When Anna was rude to a waiter, I thought that maybe she didn\u2019t have parents to teach her manners. I tried to help her, like a little sister. She was weirdly socially inept, but also very charismatic.\n\n\u2018I thought that maybe she didn\u2019t have parents to teach her manners. I tried to help her like a little sister. She was weirdly socially inept, but also very charismatic.\u2019 \u2014Rachel DeLoache Williams on her former friend, fake heiress Anna Sorokin\n\nMarketWatch: You took a trip to a luxury resort in Marrakesh. You ended up with $62,000 on your credit card. How did you get tricked into that?\n\nDeLoache Williams: The trip was not presented as this \u201call-expenses-paid\u201d vacation. It started with one thing, then another thing on top of that. First the villa, later on the flight, and then expenses. It snowballed.\n\nAnna said she was making a documentary about starting her art foundation and she said she wanted to feel like what it felt to have a camera around. She pitched it as a \u201cI\u2019m going to get this villa \u2014 who should we invite?\u201d She put the cart before the horse, in that way.\n\nI was already going to France on a work trip, so I packed this on the week before that. She invited a personal trainer and a photographer, and said she would pay for their travel and expenses, and then she added, \u201cI\u2019ll get yours too, of course.\u201d I think she really enjoyed playing this character who was generous, but I now see it as part of the con.\n\nRachel DeLoache Williams A New York Post headline on Anna Sorokin\u2019s conviction for fraud.\n\nMarketWatch: It\u2019s both amazing and crazy that she persuaded you to pay for the whole trip. It started with the plane tickets, right?\n\nDeLoache Williams: It was one small act after another. She said she was stuck in meetings, allegedly, on the day we were supposed to leave. It didn\u2019t strike me as alarming. I figured she didn\u2019t know what time she was going to finish work. I was like an involuntary producer. She gave me a credit card to use and it was declined. She said she would wire me the money the following week. The flights cost around $4,000.\n\n\u2018She picked out $1,300 worth of dresses. Her card didn\u2019t go through. I thought she hadn\u2019t told her bank that she was in Morocco.\u2019 \u2014Rachel DeLoache Williams on her former friend, fake heiress Anna Sorokin\n\nMarketWatch: And it got worse in Marrakesh.\n\nDeLoache Williams: She picked out $1,300 worth of dresses. Her card didn\u2019t go through. I thought she hadn\u2019t told her bank that she was in Morocco. I didn\u2019t know there was a problem with the hotel until midway through the trip. I saw Anna being pulled aside by two managers. They refused to leave without a functioning credit card. I had given them my card as a temporary hold. They put the bill on my card when I checked out.\n\nThe hotel cost around $52,000. Anna hired a private butler, tour guides, cars and tennis lessons every morning. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll wire you $70,000 to make sure it\u2019s all covered.\u201d I see this exorbitant sum on my credit cards and on one hand, I\u2019m grateful for the trip; on the other, I\u2019m completely shocked by the cost and extremely nervous that Anna owes me so much money.\n\nThe most hellish part of the ordeal was the months following Marrakesh. Anna was emotionally and financially abusive. I changed the view of our friendship after Marrakesh. Also, we mostly just sat in the hotel. We could have done that in New York. I was a little frustrated but hyperaware that I was a guest. I was very deferential.\n\nMarketWatch: How did you get the money back? I\u2019m surprised you managed to do that.\n\nDeLoache Williams: My corporate card was charged without my consent and American Express AXP, +1.20% protected from that after Anna\u2019s arrest. The hotel managers effectively stood in the doorway to block my way. I was repeatedly told by the hotel managers that the credit-card charge was temporary. I was a young female in a foreign country and I was put under pressure.\n\n\u2018I was repeatedly told by the hotel managers that the credit-card charge was temporary. I was a young female in a foreign country.\u2019 \u2014Rachel DeLoache Williams on her former friend, fake heiress Anna Sorokin\n\nI contested the charge a lot of times. The case was closed and I\u2019d have to reopen it. Amex is wonderful. Some other credit-card company probably wouldn\u2019t have allowed me to reopen the case so many times. (A spokeswoman for American Express said the company couldn\u2019t comment on specific cases.)\n\nMarketWatch: After you texted with Anna for months and she was arrested on Oct. 3, 2017, you reported her to the authorities.\n\nDeLoache Williams: When Anna\u2019s story broke in the New York Post, I emailed the district attorney\u2019s office in New York and sent them a link to the article. I had tried going to lawyers, but if I had sent a demand letter she would have had 30 days to contest it and, if she left the country, I would have to go abroad to file suit. It didn\u2019t seem like a viable option.\n\nI had a binder of evidence, text messages, list of names and timelines, a printout of the credit-card statement, every piece of information. Trying to get the money back from her was so destabilizing. I couldn\u2019t find an explanation for it. Gathering those documents was the only thing that made me feel productive.\n\nI went to the police first. They weren\u2019t very sympathetic. An officer said, \u201cWith your face, you could start a GoFundMe page to get your money back.\u201d\n\nRachel DeLoache Williams Anna Sorokin living the good life at a luxury hotel in Marrakesh.\n\nMarketWatch: When did you last see her?\n\nDeLoache Williams: I saw her when I was testifying at her trial. I had to identify her as the defendant. She looked at me and smirked.\n\nMarketWatch: How was testifying?\n\n\u2018I went to the police. An officer said, \u2018With your face, you could start a GoFundMe page to get your money back.\u2019 \u2014Rachel DeLoache Williams on her former friend, fake heiress Anna Sorokin\n\nDeLoache Williams: It was stressful for so many reasons. When I saw how juvenile and remorseless she was, I realized that she was the least of my worries. The lawyer was trying to assassinate my character. He brought up my book deal and movie options even though Anna and her lawyer were working with Netflix NFLX, +0.87% . (Netflix did not immediately return request for comment.)\n\nI worked really hard to do something positive with this experience. If I were planning to write a book, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be tied to something like that. I have a bucket-list goal: \u201cDo something great, so when people Google GOOG, +0.56% GOOGL, +0.52% me something else will come up.\u201d\n\nMarketWatch: Who would you like to play you in the movie?\n\nDeLoache Williams: I don\u2019t have opinions about that. I\u2019d like Larry David to play me and Danny DeVito to play Anna.\n\nMarketWatch: I bet you didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d get caught up in one of the most bizarre tabloid stories in recent years when you left Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nDeLoache Williams: It\u2019s weird that the story has such legs. It\u2019s like \u201cGossip Girl\u201d with a better plot.\n\n(This interview has been edited for style and space.)", "description": "\u2018She was weirdly socially inept, but also very charismatic.\u2019", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP052_soroki_ZG_20190808112541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
