Optimism abounds around the league.\n\nHowever, it will only take a couple of weeks before glaring holes are exposed, injuries inevitably hit, and some GMs are scrambling to repair their rosters get their team back on track.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat\u2019s where these veterans come in. Here are seven guys that can step in and help a team right now. They\u2019re flawed players (or they wouldn\u2019t still be free agents), but they\u2019re names that will pop up once teams start scrambling in the coming weeks and months.\n\n1) Iman Shumpert\n\nWing is a position of need around the NBA, and wing defenders in particular are in demand. While everyone knows Shumpert is not the peak defender he once was, he can still provide some solid play on the perimeter. Shumpert shot 34.8 percent last season, played in eight of the Rockets\u2019 playoff games, and continues to be a respectable role player. The Grizzlies and Bulls are reportedly interested in Shumpert.\n\n2) Jamal Crawford\n\nCrawford may be 39 but he can still get some buckets off the bench. No doubt the three-time Sixth Man of the Year has slowed in recent years, and his defense is an issue, but the man still averaged 7.9 points per game last season off the bench and lit it up for the depleted Suns at the end of last season. He\u2019s also improved the playmaking aspect of his game. Some team is going to turn to him for bench scoring.\n\n3) Joakim Noah\n\nStory continues\n\nHe\u2019s the best big man still on the board, and a guy the Lakers seriously considered until Dwight Howard convinced members of the staff there he is is a changed man. Noah had a good run the second half of last season with the Grizzlies \u2014 7.1 points and 5.7 rebounds a night, plus solid defense in the paint, playing more than 16 minutes a game \u2014 which showed he can still help a team out.\n\n4) J.R. Smith\n\nCleveland waived Smith in a cost-cutting move, the Bucks quickly talked to him, but since then nothing has materialized. Smith is 34 and his skills are in decline, including shooting just 30.8 percent from three last season, but it\u2019s too early to write him off. In the right situation, he could help a team off the bench with veteran play. Just don\u2019t have him on the floor to close NBA Finals games anymore.\n\n5) Kenneth Faried\n\nWhen Clint Capela was out injured for the Rockets last season, Faried stepped in and played well \u2014 he averaged 12.9 points per game on 58.7 percent shooting in 25 games for the Rockets. He\u2019s just 29, and he can be counted on to get buckets. What he can\u2019t be counted on to do is defend very well, which is why no team has snapped him up (and why he fell out of the Rockets\u2019 rotation last season). Still, he can bring energy off the bench for a team.\n\n6) Corey Brewer\n\nHe came off the bench for the Kings at the end of last season, in a very limited role, and while he had a workout with the Rockets, Brewer has not found a new home. Wings are in demand, and Brewer would be a good fit for a team that likes to get out and run (he\u2019s at his best in transition), but the fact he struggles as a shooter from three has teams hesitant. Still, once the season starts, don\u2019t be surprised if some team picks Brewer up.\n\n7) Carmelo Anthony\n\nThe reason he is on this list is his poor defense. Teams have questions about his willingness to play a role, the number of midrange jumpers he takes, his efficiency, how he would be a big story wherever he lands, and how the game has moved away from \u2018Melo\u2019s style of play, but in the end his defense remains the biggest stumbling block to landing on a new team. That said, nobody questions his talent or that he can still get buckets. If a team believes he will take a role off the bench, he could be a good pickup.", "description": "Iman Shumpert. Joakim Noah.
