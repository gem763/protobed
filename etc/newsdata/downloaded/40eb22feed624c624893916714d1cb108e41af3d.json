Their mask of choice was the one worn by Rorschach, a character from the graphic novel. Although we later see another version of Rorschach.\n\nHe works for chief of police Judd Crawford, and his mask \u2013 which is plain silver \u2013 becomes scarier to whoever is looking at him.\n\nThe mask is pretty eerie\u2026 (Picture: HBO)\n\nDr Manhattan on Mars\n\nIn a very brief news broadcast, we see Dr Manhattan on Mars \u2013 where the graphic novels left him \u2013 creating structures out of sand.\n\nThe episode also features several references to watches, most notably in the title of the five-act play Ozymandias (Jeremy Irons) tells his servants he\u2019s writing, The Watchmaker\u2019s Son.\n\nThese have been placed there with Dr Manhattan in mind. Before he became the blue atomic god, he was Jon Osterman, whose father was a meticulous fixer of time-pieces.\n\nThe Comedian\n\nIn the series, this symbol is referenced just before we meet baker-by-day, masked vigilante-by-night Angela Abar (Regina King), who we see teaching bakery in her child\u2019s class.\n\nWhen she cracks eggs into a glass bowl, the yolk forms to make a smiley face (creepy).\n\nThis was the badge of The Comedian, who dies at the very beginning of the comics.\n\nThe shocking end to this episode \u2013 the death of Judd! \u2013 is clearly a reference to this, emphasised by the splash of blood on his police badge.\n\nDid you spot any plot holes in episode 1? (Picture: HBO)\n\nPresident Robert Redford\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the comics, we learn that the actor and director was planning on running for office in the 1988 election. And now, Redford has succeeded in ousting Richard Nixon, who remained America\u2019s leader in the comics for far longer then he did in real life, and has been in the White House since the 1990s.\n\nSquid\n\nWhen asked by Entertainment Tonight what Watchmen newbies need to know going into this series, Damon Lindelof \u2013 referring to the graphic novel\u2019s climactic events \u2013 said: \u2018In November of 1985, an enormous alien squid landed in the middle of New York City and killed three million people.\u2019\n\nOur first hint of this is a poster in the background of the aforementioned classroom scene depicting a giant octopus. The words \u2018Anatomy of a squid\u2019 lie below it.\n\nJust one scene later, when sirens blare out, we see everyone pull their car over to prepare for\u2026 a squid rain shower. The world is still feeling the after-effects of that event, which happened 30 years ago.\n\n\u2018Adrian Veidt officially dead\u2019\n\nWe see a newspaper with this headline. Arian Veidt is the aforementioned Ozymandias, who we later see alive and well in an unknown location.\n\nFans will be kicking themselves that they didn\u2019t notice (Picture: HBO)\n\n\u2018Save us!\u2026 and I\u2019ll look down and whisper \u201cNo\u201d\u2018\n\nIn an eerie video sent to the Tulsa police force, we learn the Seventh Kavalry have appropriated the famous mantra taken from Rorschach\u2019s journal.\n\n\u2018Who watches the Watchmen\u2019\n\nThis quote isn\u2019t uttered in the episode, but Lindelof can\u2019t quite resist hinting at it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the scene where Judd addresses the secret police force of Tulsa, he caps his speech with the Latin phrase \u2018Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\u2019, which translates as \u2018Who will guard the guards themselves?\u2019.\n\nSister Night\n\nWhen we see Angela, in costume as Sister Night, sat in Judd Crawford\u2019s office, she\u2019s drinking from a mug that\u2019s shaped in the face of Nite Owl.\n\nThis is the hero from the comics whose mask was worn by both Hollis Mason and Dan Dreiberg at different stages.\n\nAnd later, Angela\u2019s children are also using owl-themed chopsticks.\n\nNite Owl\n\nIn the same scene, there\u2019s a book titled Under the Hood sitting on Judd\u2019s desk, which is the autobiography of Hollis Mason and details the events leading up to his first appearance as Nite Owl, and discusses the formation of a superhero team named The Minutemen.\n\nFans can\u2019t get enough (Picture: HBO)\n\nDollar Bill\n\nWhen Angela ambushes the white supremacist compound, she spots a poster featuring Dollar Bill, a bank-sponsored superhero mascot from the graphic novels.\n\nThe poster in question shows him dragging a black man out of a bank captioned with the disturbing text: \u2018Our banks are clean and safe and family-oriented and we keep the riff-raff out.\u2019\n\nOwl Ship\n\nIs the hovercraft vehicle that chief of police Judd and his accomplice Pirate Jenny the same one from the Watchmen comics? No. Lindelof told IGN that the tech created by Dan Dreiberg is now commonly used by law enforcement after being replicated by them rather than being Archimedes, the name of the precise one used by characters in Moore\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Minutemen\n\nIn what is quite clearly a loving send-up of Ryan Murphy\u2019s American Horror/Crime Story anthology shows, we see bus posters and TV trailers for a new series called American Hero Story: The Minutemen.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, this is the league of masked adventurers formed by Captain Metropolis and Silk Spectre in the graphic novels that was designed to recruit costumed fighters to help America. In the trailer, we see the show features Captain Metropolis.\n\nWatchmen is available to stream on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic and NOW TV in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
