Elizabeth Warren promised her nominee to the Department of Education would have to earn the approval of a nine-year-old child who claimed to be transgender.\n\nThe invited child, flanked by the mother, asked, \u201cWhat are you doing \u2026 to make sure that kids like me feel safer in schools? And what do you think schools need to do better to make sure that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my homework?\u201d\n\nWarren responded:\n\nSo let me start by saying, I want to have a secretary of education who both believes in public education and believes in the value of every one of our kids, and is willing to enforce our civil rights laws. It turns out that when the Department of Education was set up many years ago, the secretary of education was given a whole lot of power over the public schools, and over the rules and how they\u2019re enforced. And we\u2019ve had some secretaries of education who\u2019ve been better. And we\u2019ve had one that\u2019s been a whole lot worse. Her name is Betsy DeVos. And when I\u2019m President, she\u2019ll be gone. And here\u2019s my plan \u2026 I\u2019m going to find just the right secretary of education. But here\u2019s what I plan to do. I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story. And then I want you to tell me if you think that\u2019s the right person, and then we\u2019ll make the deal. Does that sound good?\n\n\u201cThe Equality Act is essential,\u201d said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, referring to the House-passed Equality Act, which would establish the transgender ideology as law, and so outlaw and stigmatize any recognition of the complementary differences of women and men.\n\n\u201cIf we can get five [Senate] votes, we will pass the Equality Act the next day,\u201d said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \u201cWe urgently need an Equality Act,\u201d said Mayor Pete Buttigieg. \u201cWe would pass the Equality Act right off the bat, number one,\u201d said Joe Biden.\n\nThe candidates promised to promote the status of gay and transgender people in K-12 schools, to roll back restrictions on blood donations, to appoint gay generals, and to subordinate national diplomacy to the goal of gay acceptance. \u201cI would, in fact, curtail aid, curtail foreign assistance to countries who, in fact, engage in this kind of [anti-gay] behavior,\u201d said Biden.\n\nThe audience picked by the pr0-transgender HRC was delighted with the river of promises and praise. \u201cThis means the world to all of us \u2026 I cannot believe this is happening,\u201d said activist Julia Goldman, an author of a podcast about gay politics.\n\nThe Pentagon must treat male soldiers as if they are women once they say they are transgender, said Buttigieg. \u201cThe trans military ban is an outrage \u2026 That is dead wrong \u2026 I will put an end to that,\u201d he said.\n\nReligious rights must end when \u201creligion is being used an excuse to harm other people,\u201d Buttigieg said. Religious-based opposition to gay status \u201cmakes God smaller \u2026 It is an insult to faith to believe it can be used to hurt people in that way,\u201d he said.\n\nReligious groups must agree to arrange adoptions for gay couples, said Klobuchar. \u201cYou have got to have agencies that follow the law \u2026 You have got to [endorse] adoptions for gay families,\u201d she said.\n\nConservatives & (some) feminists agree biology shapes our personalities & politics. They're uniting to stop the progressives' ruthless \"transgender\" demand that we deny biology's impact on people & politics despite the known hazards to adults, teens & kids https://t.co/gND8VfyMOl \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 9, 2019\n\nWarren jeered at critics of single-sex marriage and transgenderism. One questioner asked her:\n\nSenator, thank you for being here. Now, let\u2019s say you\u2019re on the campaign trail, and a supporter approaches you and says, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned. And my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d What is your response?\u201d Well, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that. I\u2019m going to say, just marry one woman. Assuming you can find one!\n\nA moment later, Warren declared her deep belief in charity towards other people:\n\nIt\u2019s about what I learned in the church I grew up, in first song I ever remember singing: \u201cThere is yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight. Jesus loves all the children in the world.\u201d \u2026 That was the basis of the faith that I grew up in. And it truly is about the preciousness of each and every life, it is about the worth of every human being.\n\nFormer California Attorney General, Kamala Harris, boasted of her refusal to defend California\u2019s marriage law in 2008 from advocates for single-sex marriage.\n\nTom Steyer backed body-changing drugs for teenagers who say they are transgender. \u201cAll of that care should be available for all transgender youth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be part of the public [healthcare] option I believe in \u2026 It is an absolute right, and this is a critical part of healthcare for these young people.\u201d\n\nWarren promised taxpayer funding for cosmetic surgery for people who want to live as members of the opposite sex:\n\nI believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who \u2014 it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that\u2019s important and the appropriate medical care.\n\nCNN\u2019s announcers excluded any possible critics or skeptical questioners who might spotlight the political risks posed by the candidates\u2019 unreserved support for transgender ideology. That ideology would change women\u2019s status and rights, change education rules, and girls\u2019 sports.\n\nAmy Klobuchar provided the only moment of disagreement when she declined to endorse a call for legal prostitution. \u201cI am not in favor of demineralizing all of sex work,\u201d she said, but quickly backtracked, \u201cbut I\u2019d love to talk with you for a few minutes and see if we can find common ground going forward.\u201d\n\nThe only loud opposition came from several attendees who described themselves as black transgender women, including one named Blossom. A second person rebuked one CNN announcer for a mispronouncing the person\u2019s name, saying, \u201cit is violence to \u2018misgender\u2019 or to alter the name of a transperson.\u201d A group interrupted the event to chant about \u201cblack trans\u201d lives.\n\nBut Beto O\u2019Rourke pushed the envelope.\n\n\u201cDiscrimination\u201d against people who are homosexual or transgender cannot be tolerated, he said. \u201cThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, any institution\u2026 that denies the human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us.\u201d\n\nHe promised cheap anti-AIDS medicine: \u201cWe\u2019ll bring down that cost \u2026 We will take over that patent and make sure it is distributed to every person in America.\u201d\n\nMental-health professionals should not be allowed to guide adults or children who prefer to detransition from transgender status or to change homosexual feelings. \u201cConversion therapy \u2026 should be illegal,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cAs president, I will seek to outlaw it everywhere in this country \u2026 this is tantamount to torture \u2014 a torture we visit on children who are absolutely defenseless,\u201d he said.\n\nBeto also promised a new policy to counter the murder of black transgender women, saying, \u201cthey will be the guide on this issue \u2014 they will direct our policy.\u201d Countering the murders is \u201ca matter of restoring the very fabric of America,\u201d he said.", "description": "Democratic politicians agreed with almost every demand made by the audience of invited transgender advocates at a Thursday town hall.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/transgender-activism-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
