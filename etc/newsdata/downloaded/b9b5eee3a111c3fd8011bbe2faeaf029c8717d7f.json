Wallin, you see, was selected to lose with a bit of grit and dignity and not bust Fury up so bad that he went straight to hospital at the end of the fight for surgery to close the wounds.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But the healing process on severe lacerations \u2013 there is the possibility of plastic surgery \u2013 could interfere with Fury\u2019s plans to go to training camp. He might not be able to spar for over two months, probably longer, and that could cause a logistics problem.\n\nWilder, meanwhile, is supposed to have a fight in November, but that is looking increasingly unlikely \u2013 perhaps after the scare here, it is simply too big a risk to take. \u201cIt\u2019s the heavyweight business and anything can happen and does happen,\u201d said Frank Warren, Fury\u2019s promoter.\n\nThe cuts changed the fight, that is without doubt, but the extra rounds were necessary for Fury, ideal preparation for what is likely to be another gruelling affair with Wilder. If Fury had done as expected and buckled Wallin\u2019s resistance after five or six rounds, there is every chance that people would have suggested Fury needed more rounds between the twelve with Wilder last December and the prospect of twelve more next February. He got what he needed and certainly not what he wanted against Wallin.\n\nFury\u2019s fitness was tested, his nerve was tested during the inspection by the doctor, and he remained calm both in the corner \u2013 as his cuts man, Jorge Capetillo, used his potions and craft to control the bleeding as best he could \u2013 and during the rounds when Wallin was rough and relentless. It was, in the end, an old-fashioned brawl, a real shock to the senses, and dozens at close ringside went home from the T-Mobile with a splatter of Fury on their clothing \u2013 a novelty and unexpected souvenir.\n\nWallin justified his selection, fulfilled his promises and survived five or six moments when he was hurt, dazed and being pushed all over the ring. Fury used his bulk brilliantly at times, but it was not a flawless performance; it was a hard fight, and even if he won eight or nine of the twelve rounds, he had to fight in every single one of them, especially from the third when the blood started to flow.\n\n\u201cHe hurt me in the last,\u201d Fury admitted to me in the ring at the final bell.\n\n\u201cI told all of you that he was dangerous and that he would give me a test.\n\nFury and his trainer, Ben Davison, had been talking all week about Wallin \u2013 big at 6\u20195 and also a southpaw \u2013 and how difficult he might be. The Swede had also made pledges, realising that a \u201cgood\u201d defeat would not harm his career.\n\nSo Fury never led the crowd in song at the end and those expecting a jolly, easy, Mexican-themed fiesta were perhaps a bit shocked by just how bloody, brutal and unpredictable two heavyweights can be in a fight that matters.\n\nFury knows all about fighting and bleeding and winning. On Saturday night here in Las Vegas, he just reminded a few people.", "description": "The blood was pumping from Tyson Fury\u2019s wounds for nine rounds, the referee and the doctor were poised to stop the fight, and every surface in the ring was stained.
