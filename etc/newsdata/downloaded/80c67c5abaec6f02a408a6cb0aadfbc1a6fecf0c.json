But I think the Batman thing, flying down onto the dance floor, then having to do the dance afterwards, that felt a bit weird.\n\n\"Obviously on a live show, in costume, loads of make-up. For two days afterwards I had black eyeliner on. I looked like I was a band member of the Cure.\"\n\nJames and Bychkova beat TV presenter Anneka Rice and dance partner Kevin Clifton to survive for this weeks show.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThe 49-year-old admitted to losing a stone-and-a-half in weight since starting the series, after committing to gruelling 11-hour days.\n\nAfter some initial criticism from judge Craig Revel Horwood, James appeared to win him over this week with an improved performance.\n\nWhen discussing judge Shirley Ballas, James likened her to Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, and said of Revel Horwood: \"I\u2019ll call him Harry Redknapp. I love both managers so that\u2019s a compliment.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe added that Bruno Tonioli's \"pure emotion\" reminded him of his former West Ham teammate Paolo di Canio, while Motsi Mabuse's \"elegance\" was like ex-Portsmouth player Nwankwo Kanu.\n\nJames named ex-England star Wayne Rooney as the worst dancer among his footballer friends, and former Bolton midfielder Jay Jay Okocha as the best.\n\nJames is working as an ambassador for the Safer Gambling campaign - Bet Regret.\n\nHe said: \"This isn\u2019t an anti-gambling campaign. It\u2019s just about making punters more aware of the risks of impulsive gambling.\n\n\"It\u2019s not even about whether the bet wins or loses. It\u2019s about that actual bet that you regret.\n\n\"We want to make people aware that this is impulsive gambling and shouldn\u2019t be done.\"\n\nDavid James has teamed up with GambleAware and the Football Supporters\u2019 Association (FSA) as an ambassador for the Safer Gambling campaign \u2013 Bet Regret.
