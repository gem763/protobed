All Murphy has to do these days is merely confirm his next big project and the world halts briefly on its axis to again admire his moxie. (Beanie Feldstein as Monica Lewinsky in the next \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d \u2014 why, it\u2019s brilliant already, and no one will even see it for another year. Insert a row of exclamation points here. Heck, insert another row.)\n\nHis secret, I think, is just to let go and let the idea run wild, roughshod if necessary, with whatever borrowed styles and pop-cultural references will get the job done. Let other producers and writers rooms fret about whether an idea is too pat or too over the top. In Murphy\u2019s world, the audience and critics will either eventually come around (witness Billy Porter\u2019s lead actor triumph at the Emmys the other night for Murphy\u2019s FX drama \u201cPose\u201d) or, at minimum, applaud the effort.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s such a big deal that Murphy and his collaborators have moved operations to Netflix, pushing their new ideas forward while still tending to the valuable franchises (\u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d \u201c9-1-1\u201d) they created at FX and Fox.\n\nFriday\u2019s debut of \u201cThe Politician,\u201d a darkly comic, eight-episode drama about a kid (Ben Platt) convinced of his destiny to become U.S. president, firmly plants Murphy\u2019s flag on Netflix\u2019s moneyed turf. Co-created by two of Murphy\u2019s most trusted collaborators (Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan), the series is a deeply cynical and unfortunately supercilious restating of an old Washington cliche, that politics is really just high school and vice versa.\n\nThe tone and look of the series feel at first like a heavy aping, bordering on theft, of film director Wes Anderson\u2019s fascination with preternaturally gifted teen ambition, a la \u201cRushmore,\u201d and one-percenter ennui, a la \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums.\u201d (For an echo effect, Murphy has roped one of those Tenenbaums, Gwyneth Paltrow, into playing the young politician\u2019s doting mother.)\n\nA dog-piling of other influences seem to come and go: \u201cHeathers,\u201d \u201cClueless,\u201d \u201cElection,\u201d one or two Bret Easton Ellis novels, the original version of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and the callousness of \u201cVeep,\u201d for starters. Somehow, it\u2019s all in here, a mash-up of deadpan vibes and manic melodrama made brighter and prettier: all the best parts, underlined to death. The result is both irritating and fun, a feeling that has become something of a Murphy hallmark.\n\nWhich also means that \u201cThe Politician\u201d is exceedingly watchable, precisely what Netflix wants and what Murphy and his gang so ably deliver. Once again, uncanny timing and instinct prevail: Who else lands a romp about the inherent soullessness of politics right as a Democratic-led House of Representatives launches an impeachment investigation against America\u2019s most willfully reprobate president? \u201cThe Politician\u201d arrives just when viewer appetites for a fancily framed swamp-wallow will range from ravenous to repulsed. It\u2019s not exactly escapist TV.\n\n\n\nGwyneth Paltrow plays Payton\u2019s mother in Ryan Murphy\u2019s new series. (Netflix)\n\nJessica Lange portrays Dusty Jackson in a scene-stealing role. (Netflix)\n\nPlatt plays Payton Hobart, deep into his campaign for president of the student council at St. Sebastian, a hyper-elite private high school in Santa Barbara, Calif., where elections come with all the trappings of high-stakes politics. Payton is guided by a pair of comically devoted top advisers (Laura Dreyfuss and Theo Germaine), who hope to accompany him all the way to the White House and rely on polling data so intense that it accounts for ethnic demographics as narrow as a single student of Haitian descent.\n\n\u201cYou see, gentlemen, I\u2019m going to be president of the United States,\u201d Payton tells two aghast but pliant Harvard officials who are considering his early admission and salivating at his parents\u2019 wealth. \u201cI don\u2019t say that to impress you or to seem terribly precocious. I\u2019m merely stating it as a fact. I will be president someday because I will stop at nothing.\u201d\n\nA more pressing campaign crisis is the absence of a perfect, thoroughly vetted running mate who can bring in the student voters Payton isn\u2019t reaching. The search leads to Infinity Jackson (Zoey Deutch), a sweet but terminally ill girl who is a lock on the sympathy vote and lives with her exploitative, no-good grandmother, Dusty. (Chalk up another scene-stealing, boozy role for Jessica Lange, Murphy\u2019s most reliable house player.) I know Murphy gets testy when critics call his shows campy, but c\u2019mon. Near the end, he throws in equally delectable roles for Judith Light and Bette Midler on top of Paltrow\u2019s tongue-in-cheek sendup of New Age daffiness. What are we supposed to call it? A hoot?\n\nEpisodes progress with proportionally enlarged themes that are presented as fresh political insights and hot takes: Payton\u2019s campaign is jeopardized by secrets and lies. There are assassination attempts, accusations of voter fraud, provisional ballots, campaign finance violations and private hurts endured on behalf of the public face. It will all seem quite clever to those viewers who either haven\u2019t watched or simply forgot an entire canon of political satire that came before \u201cThe Politician.\u201d Everyone else may find it predictably, even tediously, cynical.\n\nThe only episode that seems to locate a new vein of humor is devoted to a pimply, sex-obsessed loner (Russell Posner as \u201cThe Voter\u201d) who vexes St. Sebastian\u2019s eager pollsters and every get-out-the-vote effort with his deep lack of interest in or awareness of the candidates or their platforms. He just doesn\u2019t care and, as such, is typically American.\n\nAs the story plods on, \u201cThe Politician\u2019s\u201d atmospherics do wear thin \u2014 the precise lampooning of extreme wealth; the machine-like efficiency of these budding operatives and the degree to which they\u2019ll sell their souls for a chance at victory. Platt, who is beloved for his stage presence (especially in the Broadway hit \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d), is less engaging on the binge screen, even when given the opportunity to sing. As with any Murphy production, there\u2019s a wayward subplot or two (or four), one of which has Payton joining the cast of the school musical, which can\u2019t fix a real problem throughout: You just don\u2019t believe in Platt\u2019s character \u2014 not as a teenager, not as a politician, not as anything but an overwhelmed actor in a show that struggles to maintain its artistic discipline.\n\nThings improve near the end. Without giving away key details, life doesn\u2019t always go Payton\u2019s way, which gives us a hint of the second season Netflix has eagerly preordered. Payton\u2019s journey may not follow the path he envisioned, but the lure of politics is impossible to resist \u2014 \u201cborn to be in it,\u201d as Beto O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nIn other words, I guess we\u2019re stuck with him.\n\nThe Politician (eight episodes) is available for streaming Friday on Netflix.", "description": "The Netflix series stars Ben Platt as a rich teen who sees student council as a path to the White House.", "authors": ["Hank Stuever", "Tv Critic", "September At Pm", "Hank Stuever Has Been The Washington Post'S Tv Critic Since He Joined The Paper In As A Reporter For The Style Section", "Where He Covered Popular Culture."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KafsaTxUD1Ei0olx6BzxDhBXnbU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S5J5S6G7CEI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
