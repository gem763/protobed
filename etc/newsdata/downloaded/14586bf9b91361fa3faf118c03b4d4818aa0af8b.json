Authorities say Maricopa County Assessor Paul Petersen's fraudulent adoption enterprise left a trail of forged documents and violated U.S. and international laws.\n\nPetersen operates an adoption law firm. For years, he has connected American families seeking to adopt with women from the Marshall Islands \u2014 but state and federal prosecutors say Petersen falsified documents and lied about the mothers' residency so he could enrich himself.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Arkansas on Wednesday unsealed a criminal indictment against Petersen and an associate, Maki Takehisa, on smuggling, money laundering and visa fraud charges.\n\nIn Arizona, Petersen has been indicted on theft, fraud and forgery charges for allegedly claiming pregnant women from the Marshall Islands were residents of Arizona in order to obtain medical care for them. He is also accused of violating an international agreement between the U.S. and the Marshall Islands that allows Marshallese residents to travel and take jobs in the U.S. but that bans them from entering the U.S. for the purpose of placing a child for adoption.\n\nIn separate charging documents, Utah prosecutors accuse Petersen of human smuggling for \"adoption-related exploitation in the Republic of the Marshall Islands,\" claiming Petersen has targeted birth mothers in the Marshall Islands as well as adoptive parents in the United States.\n\nIn Utah, prosecutors said Petersen transported more than 40 pregnant women from the Marshall Islands and charged parents in the U.S. tens of thousands of dollars for the adoption of the women's newborns. Each time, authorities say, he lured the pregnant women to the U.S. with payments of $10,000.\n\nDuring that same period, $2.7 million related to the alleged smuggling operation flowed into Petersen's bank account, according to Utah authorities.\n\nThe women sometimes came to Utah just days before they were expected to give birth. They stayed in a home owned by Petersen, according to the charging documents. At times, Petersen allegedly housed as many as 15 pregnant women in the same home, leading one tipster to describe Petersen's business as a \"baby mill.\"\n\nParents interviewed by Utah investigators said Petersen and his associates lied or omitted information about the adoptions, including that the pregnant women were paid for the adoptions and that the process was forbidden under international law.\n\n\"It is heartbreaking that these families from both countries were so cruelly manipulated,\" Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said in a statement.\n\nThe Marshall Islands, which gained full independence in 1986, is an island nation of some 53,000 people that was formerly the site of U.S nuclear weapons tests.\n\nNeither Petersen nor his lawyer has replied to requests by NPR for comment.\n\nAccording to a website for Petersen's firm, the average cost he charges for completing an adoption of a Marshallese child is $30,000 to $40,000.\n\nThe site touts Petersen's expertise in arranging adoptions from the Marshall Islands, citing testimonials from people who note his \"genuine passion\" and praise him for \"making a difference in the world.\"\n\nThe site says Petersen's firm is uniquely suited to carry out adoptions in the Pacific Island nation.\n\n\"Paul is the only attorney involved with the Marshallese community in the United States who is fluent in the Marshallese language. Because of this fact, Paul has been successful in hundreds of Marshallese adoptions across many different states,\" according to Petersen's site. It adds, \"Paul lived in the Marshall Islands for two years, and therefore is familiar with their language, customs, and unique cultural perspective on adoption.\"\n\nIn November, Honolulu Civil Beat published an investigation titled \"Black Market Babies\" that focused on Petersen's question-raising practice of flying in pregnant women from the Marshall Islands and connecting their newborn children with American adoptive parents.\n\nThe news outlet interviewed women from the Marshall Islands who said they never expected to sever all ties with their children before handing their kids over to parents in the United States. The investigation called Petersen the most active Marshallese-adoption lawyer in America.", "description": "Maricopa County Assessor Paul Petersen has been arrested for allegedly transporting dozens of women from the Marshall Islands to give birth for adoptions.
