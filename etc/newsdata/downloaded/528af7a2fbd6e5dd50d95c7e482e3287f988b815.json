Apple\u2019s history is so spectacular that its event draws fan excitement like the launch of a new superhero movie. This year was different, however, because fans focused on Apple\u2019s perceived lack of innovation.\n\nFor many customers, Apple\u2019s history of relying on its internal team to \u201cthink different\u201d was no longer enough. The comments from Apple\u2019s customers reminded me of a famous talk delivered by the late Steve Jobs about why culturally Apple prefers internal vs. external sources of innovation and why this offers a potential explanation for the frustration of Apple\u2019s fans.\n\nIn 1992, Steve Jobs delivered an interesting critique about the dangers of external thinking through his views of consultants. He somewhat jokingly pointed out that there is nothing \u201cinherently evil\u201d about consultants and their ideas. His issue was simply that a consultant, or really anyone from the outside, is less wise because they don\u2019t get to live with their recommendations long enough to truly learn from them.\n\nHe suggested that it is only by owning the process and living with your failures as an operator that you develop deep and valuable insight. Said simply, carrying deep scars of past failure produces superior judgement.\n\nWhile it\u2019s always a huge amount of fun to joke about consultants, this \u201coutside vs. inside\u201d way of seeing the world is very common at companies. However, just as how the phone industry was very different 27 years ago before the iPhone, the business world has changed radically since Steve\u2019s day.\n\nWhile I personally might be a bit biased, the fact is that the market moves so fast that very few companies can operate, much less innovate, without using consultants or freelancers. It is just too expensive or risky to only work with people employed internally.\n\nAlso, as an obvious side comment, we also know that people do not consistently learn from their mistakes or develop innovative business concepts because of them.\n\nBefore jumping into this deeper, I have to be honest and admit that I saw the world through the lens of the \u201cbusiness operator bias\u201d when I worked in venture capital.\n\nOperators vs. non-operators\n\nWe would assume years of experience in a role produced superior judgement or some special insight that advantaged a company. We would invest in operators with more confidence believing they had a better chance of succeeding. Looking back, operators failed just as spectacularly as some of the non-operators that came from consulting or banking or academics.\n\nOne big issue is that operators suffer from something that you rarely see in non-operators. This is the proverbial military general\u2019s habit of always fighting your last battle. Generals will strategize based on distant and potentially obsolete threats. They create plans that focus so much on the past battle scars \u2014 they don\u2019t realize that the battle is done and a new, completely different one is coming.\n\nThey also often try to hold a hill (a market position) just for the sake of not retreating, even if the hill they are holding is worthless long-term. Moreover, they can\u2019t see obvious opportunities because sometimes \u201cvaluable\u201d experience coupled with stress and fear make us too cautious or too narrow in our thinking.\n\nWe see this play out in venture but you also see it in large corporations that fail to act or innovate. The reality is that companies big and small fail or just muddle along directly because of the operators running them, so how are operators superior?\n\nOperators become consultants\n\nHere is another factor around this bias that needs to be surfaced because it is so out of step with the changing world of work. Today, many of the brightest people are leaving roles as operators to become freelancers or consultants.\n\nIn fact, a recent report from Morgan Stanley indicated that over 50 percent of the workforce will be freelancers by 2027. Part of this is that technology has made it easier to not be part of a big organization.\n\nAnother big reason is that smart and visionary thinkers (young or old) want to exist outside the types of corporate structures operators love to impose. Process and bureaucracy are part and parcel of the operator\u2019s tool kit.\n\nIt is critical to understand that Steve Jobs was speaking from a time and place that was different. Back then people generally aspired to be part of a successful company and join the culture. That has changed significantly.\n\nAnother implied aspect of Steve\u2019s view is that operators should have better ideas than consultants because of their valuable history. This tends to not be true in practice.\n\nIf you look at BCG\u2019s top-50 most innovative companies, the majority of the top-10 were created by non-operators. It is a fact that the best ideas and many of the leading new companies were created by interdisciplinary teams with very little real business experience.\n\nWhen you look at the data, you come to realize that three random people at a bar in San Francisco are more likely to dream up a unicorn start-up than a room full of operators sitting at a Fortune 100 company.\n\nOutsider\u2019s perspective\n\nWhen you look at these business realities today, you can see how imperative it is to embrace outside thinking. Instead of hating consultants, we should hate their frameworks and process. Working collaboratively with outsiders should be supported and enabled regardless of your sector.\n\nIt\u2019s only through mixing ideas from inside the organization with ideas from outside the organization that you often see the spark that ignites fresh thinking.\n\nMoreover, in today\u2019s ever changing competitive landscape, the vast majority of companies do not have the internal resources, data, or insight into their market to be insular. Not everyone can be Google with its ability to pull from within or recruit brilliant minds to be better or move faster. Most companies struggle to keep up, much less thrive if they rely just on insiders.\n\nThese changes are ushering a potential new era of consulting that harnesses new approaches to building the engagement teams. Teams can now draw from the growing pool of exceptional consultants and freelancers to move fast.\n\nIn the end, I agree with Steve\u2019s point about the underlying importance of living with your decisions. With the changes in technology and opportunity to build radical, interdisciplinary teams, we should not dismiss the value of consultants who also value what comes with operational experience but know that that is no longer enough.", "description": "Late Steve Jobs said Apple prefers internal vs. external sources of innovation, but Apple fans' frustration are an idicator times have changed.", "authors": ["Jason Anderson", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/podium?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F12%2FSteve-Jobs-5-faces.jpg&signature=064868a3ada2f2344620229f8e54f493", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
