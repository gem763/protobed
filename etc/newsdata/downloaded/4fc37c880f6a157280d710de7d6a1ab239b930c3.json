Police said the investigation was unable to determine what motivated the carnage.\n\nAD\n\nHotel owner files lawsuits against Las Vegas massacre victims\n\nThe settlement agreement is expected to be between $735 million and $800 million, with the final amount depending on how many victims and people affected choose to participate, according to MGM, which owns the Mandalay Bay.\n\nThe agreement does not include an admission of liability on the part of MGM, the company said Thursday. MGM also said it has insurance coverage up to $751 million.\n\nThe shooting on Oct. 1, 2017, set off lawsuits, including litigation accusing MGM of negligence in failing to monitor the gunman as he delivered guns and ammunition to his room. The settlement process should conclude late next year, the company said, and would also resolve lawsuits MGM has filed against victims, seeking to dismiss claims stemming from the rampage.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have always believed that prolonged litigation around these matters is in no one\u2019s best interest,\u201d Jim Murren, chairman and chief executive of MGM Resorts, said in a statement. \u201cIt is our sincere hope that this agreement means that scenario will be avoided.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMass attacks are frequently followed by a wave of lawsuits, as victims and their relatives take action against the institutions and individuals they argue failed to prevent the violence. But what set the Las Vegas attack apart from the beginning was its stunning scale.\n\nThere were 22,000 people at the Route 91 Harvest festival the night of the attack. In addition to the dozens of people who were slain, more than 860 were injured, nearly half by gunshots or shrapnel, authorities said.\n\nAD\n\nCountless more suffered psychological anguish from living through a scene they have described as unimaginably chaotic and terrifying.\n\nMuhammad S. Aziz, an attorney who said he participated in the settlement agreement and is representing more than 1,300 victims and survivors of the attack, said in a statement that it \u201csends a strong message to the hospitality industry that all steps necessary to prevent mass shootings must be taken.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRobert Eglet, another attorney for victims, said the agreement was \u201ca milestone in the recovery process for the victims of the horrifying events.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families,\u201d Eglet said in a statement released by MGM. He and his firm did not immediately respond to messages seeking further comment.\n\nAD\n\nSurvivors recount the terror and chaos of the Las Vegas massacre\n\nMGM has said publicly that it was participating in mediation with attorneys for victims who had sued the company over the massacre. In a May filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, MGM referred to this mediation and said it \u201cintends for substantially all claimants to be covered by the settlement,\u201d though it acknowledged that some may choose not to join.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, MGM filed its own lawsuits against more than 1,000 survivors of the attack, arguing that it had \u201cno liability of any kind\u201d and asking courts to dismiss claims relating to the massacre.\n\nThe settlement will resolve those lawsuits as well as all others that the company knows about, John McManus, MGM\u2019s general counsel, said in a telephone interview Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nMcManus said the company\u2019s long-standing desire was to settle all litigation.\n\n\u201cThe notion that we\u2019d be embroiled in disputes with victims we wish nothing but the best for, for a number of years, that is not a path that was appealing to us in any way,\u201d McManus said.\n\nHe said the company hopes \u201cthis settlement provides meaningful and fair compensation to the people that are most impacted\u201d and helps the community in its recovery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible, unspeakable tragedy, and it can\u2019t be undone,\u201d McManus said. \u201cAnd unfortunately the person who is responsible, there\u2019s no way to bring that person to justice. All we can do is move forward.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The agreement was announced two years after a gunman killed 58 people on the Strip.", "authors": ["Mark Berman", "National Reporter Covering Law Enforcement", "Criminal Justice"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SjH3JHgXo5EIQlkC4cHvwNJ1RWg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JOJL5MHF74I6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg"}
