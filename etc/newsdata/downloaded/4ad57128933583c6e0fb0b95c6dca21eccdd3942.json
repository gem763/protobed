When Welke looked out the window, she said she was confused by the four-legged object that was still flashing and humming after it hit the ground.\n\nWelke said the object included an aluminum foil-wrapped box and solar panels. Inside, she found two large cameras and one Samsung cellphone.\n\nGratiot County Herald on Facebook\n\nThe structure was just half of a balloon launched by Samsung Europe for a \"Space Selfie\" campaign that allowed customers to send their selfies into the Earth's stratosphere via a Galaxy S10 5G smartphone. The phone was supposed to receive photos from Earth and layer them over real-time shots of the planet for an out-of-this-world take on an ordinary selfie.\n\nThe discovery of the satellite came just days after actress Cara Delevigne kicked off the campaign at an event in London, taking the first selfie of the service that was supposed to run until October 31.\n\nThe person who picked up the contraption from Welke's home told her it was launched from Iowa on Friday with the purpose of taking photos. The representative said he was from Raven Industries, a technology company based in South Dakota.\n\nThe satellite's landing came around the same time local authorities closed a portion of a nearby road to remove the large, deflated balloon from power lines. Some residents had their electricity cut off for two hours while crews worked to remove the deflated balloon, according to ABC News.\n\nIn a widely circulated statement, a spokesperson for Samsung Europe said it was a planned descent that was complicated by the weather.\n\n\"Earlier today, Samsung Europe's SpaceSelfie balloon came back down to earth,\" the statement read. \"During this planned descent of the balloon to land in the US, weather conditions resulted in an early soft landing in a selected rural area. No injuries occurred and the balloon was subsequently retrieved. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused.\"", "description": "Nancy Welke of Merrill, Michigan was baffled when she found a mysterious four-legged object on her property that was still flashing and humming.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db5ff33dee0196dcd62a777?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
