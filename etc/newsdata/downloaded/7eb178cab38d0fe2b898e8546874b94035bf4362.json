But scientists have some new evidence for a theory.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nA photo purported to show the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland. On Thursday, scientist Neil Gemmell from the University of Otago in New Zealand said a research project found a surprisingly high amount of eel DNA in the water. (AP)\n\nIt was a science story made for the headlines: a monster, more than a thousand years of mystery and maybe, finally, an answer.\n\nNeil Gemmell had that potential for publicity in mind when he led a team of scientists to look for DNA from the elusive Loch Ness Monster \u2014 and again when that team announced Thursday that a large eel could be behind all the speculation.\n\n\u201cI am unashamedly using the monster as a way to attract interest so I can talk about the science I want to talk about,\u201d the geneticist and professor at New Zealand\u2019s University of Otago told The Washington Post after a hectic day of dozens of media interviews.\n\nMore than a thousand Loch Ness Monster encounters are recorded in an official \u201cSightings Register.\u201d The reports go back as far as 565 A.D., when an Irish saint is said to have saved a man from being attacked by a river monster.\n\nRumors intensified in the 1930s, when a road opened near the Scottish loch and when a reference to a \u201cLoch Ness Monster\u201d appeared in the Inverness Courier. One man swore he saw a 25-foot-long, 4-foot-high creature without limbs cross the road in front of him and his wife. Some monster sightings were debunked \u2014 a famous 1934 photo published in the Daily Mail turned out to be a hoax, staged with a model head attached to a toy submarine \u2014 but interest in the legend persisted.\n\nIn fact, after Gemmell\u2019s announcement landed, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he \u201cyearns to believe\u201d in the Loch Ness Monster, according to PA Media, which reported Friday:\n\nThe Prime Minister said he had wanted the mythical creature to be real when he was child, adding \u201cpart of me still does.\u201d\n\n[He asked the FBI to analyze \u2018Bigfoot\u2019 hair 40 years ago and never heard back. Until now.]\n\nTrying to explain the repeated reports of a giant sea creature, some theorized that the loch was home to a Jurassic-era reptile and pointed to a giant extinct animal called a plesiosaur. Others speculated about a huge fish, swimming circus elephants or just floating branches.\n\nGemmell and his colleagues say they can use science to rule out some of the ideas after analyzing DNA in 250 water samples from Loch Ness.\n\nThe DNA allowed them to build a detailed picture of the creatures living in what Gemmell called \u201cthe world\u2019s most famous body of water,\u201d down to tiny bacteria. They found no evidence that the lake harbors a prehistoric reptile, and no DNA from sharks, catfish or sturgeons, some of the other animals put forth to explain the myth.\n\nThere was a lot of genetic material from eels, however.\n\n\u201cThe remaining theory that we cannot refute based on the environmental DNA data obtained is that what people are seeing is a very large eel,\u201d the team wrote on its website explaining the findings.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear, the scientists said, whether the loch contains an eel big enough to account for descriptions of a monster. Some researchers have raised the eel theory before, and people have reported seeing large eels in Loch Ness. A video shot in 2007 captures a four-meter marine animal on the loch\u2019s surface that could have been an eel, Gemmell\u2019s team says, although they acknowledge that such a large specimen would be unusual.\n\nNot everyone is impressed with their findings. Steve Feltham, who holds the Guinness Book of Records\u2019 distinction for longest continuous Loch Ness monster hunt, told the BBC that the idea of eels living in the loch was no revelation. Other animals have yet to be ruled out, he added.\n\n\u201cA 12-year-old boy could tell you there are eels in Loch Ness,\u201d Feltham said. \u201cI caught eels in the loch when I was a 12-year-old boy.\u201d\n\nYoung eels migrate thousands of miles to Scottish rivers and lochs \u2014 lakes or sea inlets \u2014 from waters near the Bahamas, the BBC reported. The creatures lay eggs after their journeys.\n\n[Scientists plan to scour Loch Ness for the elusive monster\u2019s DNA]\n\nConfronted at a news conference with the fact that the heaviest recorded European eel ever caught clocked in at 5.38 kilograms (almost 12 pounds), Gemmell admitted, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like a monster, does it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut based on the evidence we\u2019ve accumulated, we can\u2019t exclude it as a possibility,\u201d he said, according to the Guardian.\n\nGemmell is not sure he will be involved in any further investigation to back up the eel hypothesis. He said he\u2019s achieved what he wanted with a project that\u2019s captured the public imagination like no other study he\u2019s published. Last year, he said, the scientists\u2019 work at Loch Ness generated about 3,000 media stories within a few weeks \u2014 before they\u2019d made a single finding.\n\nAt first, Gemmell said, he worried that an exhaustive investigation into Loch Ness was silly.\n\nBut then he talked to his 9-year-old son, who told his friends, who thought the project sounded awesome. After seeing the children\u2019s fascination, Gemmell realized that taking a serious scientific look at the famous loch could stir up public interest in techniques to track biodiversity.\n\nGemmell\u2019s team took advantage of \u201cenvironmental DNA,\u201d the genetic material that creatures leave in their surroundings. This \u201ceDNA\u201d lets scientists learn about habitats without disrupting them and harming the animals they\u2019re trying to study, Gemmell\u2019s team explains on its website.\n\nThe strategy will \u201cmake a real difference in how we monitor and protect the world\u2019s increasingly fragile ecosystems,\u201d they write.\n\nA Travel Channel documentary on the team\u2019s work airing in Britain and the United States later this month will bring the project to an even broader audience.\n\n\u201cLoch Ness attracts people in a way that few other things ever could,\u201d Gemmell said.\n\nRead more:\n\nFive surprising moments in vaccine history\n\nAn L.A.-area fault looked dormant.
