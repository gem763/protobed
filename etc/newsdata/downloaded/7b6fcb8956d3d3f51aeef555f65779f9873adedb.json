Washington Stage Guild has long specialized in Shaw, and the troupe\u2019s comfort with the material finds visual expression in Carl Gudenius and Jingwei Dai\u2019s pitch-perfect set: a genteel Victorian sitting room with patterned wallpaper and book-crammed shelves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is the home of the Rev. James Morell (Nathan Whitmer), a socialist Anglican clergyman who\u2019s a star speaker on the progressive lecture circuit. After he and his charismatic wife, Candida (Emelie Faith Thompson), befriend the lonely, aristocratic Marchbanks, the poet promptly falls in love with his new female acquaintance. Soon, Morell and Marchbanks are squaring off in a romantic showdown that\u2019s also a clash of worldviews, with practical humanitarianism pitted against castles-in-the-air individualistic sentiment.\n\nWhitmer and Thompson (spouses in real life) are confident onstage presences \u2014 among other highlights, Thompson supplies a hilarious bit of business with a fireplace poker \u2014 although their characters don\u2019t seem to breathe Shavian air as naturally as Marchbanks does. David Bryan Jackson is funny and persuasive as Candida\u2019s father, Mr. Burgess, a snobbish businessman whose predatory labor practices vex the Rev. Morell. First seen undulating across a threshold, thumbs tucked in the vest of his checked suit (Cheryl Yancey designed the apt period costumes), Mr. Burgess is a zesty comic figure, but he represents exploitative capitalism clearly enough to give the production political bite.\n\nDanielle Scott is a tad stiff as the Rev. Morell\u2019s secretary; Danny Beason is slightly better as a bumbling curate. Even with the hint of artifice that clings to some of the show\u2019s performances, this \u201cCandida\u201d delivers eloquence and rom-com pleasures while musing meaningfully about topics such as marriage, idealism, work/life balance and the crippling power of doubt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the stage only lights up when Ribler\u2019s Marchbanks is skulking around in his velvet smoking jacket, looking now anguished, now insolent, now ecstatic. At one point, when the poet believes his love life is going well, he improvises an exuberant jig in the middle of the room. Watching this absurd disrupter, you feel like doing the same.\n\nCandida by George Bernard Shaw. Directed by Laura Giannarelli; lighting design, Marianne Meadows; sound, Frank DiSalvo Jr. Two hours. Tickets: $50-60.
