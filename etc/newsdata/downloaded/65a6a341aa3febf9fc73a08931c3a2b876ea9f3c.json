Nothing kneejerk. And not just confined to professional football, but tangible, meaningful and unified steps that will better protect people from head impacts across all levels of sport.\n\nThe findings from what was the largest ever study into the incidence of neurodegenerative disease in any sport were, after all, emphatic. Former professional footballers were 3.5 times more likely to die of dementia or neurological disease than the rest of the matched population. With a huge sample size of almost 8,000 ex-professional players, extensive peer-review before publication in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, and a methodology that involved verifying death certificates even with medical prescriptions, football\u2019s governing bodies have had no choice but to face a difficult truth.\n\nIt is a truth, though, which also presents opportunity in an area of sports administration where progress has been frustratingly slow and inconsistent. \u201cThis is a moment to say our management of head injuries across all sports must improve from today,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cAll sports should be doing the same thing. We should not have a position in rugby where a player is going off for 10 minutes to be assessed with really sophisticated sideline assessments and, in football, they are still managed on the park. You need to have a 10 minute assessment at least and, if that means a substitution goes on, then that\u2019s fine. This is protecting a player\u2019s brain. Sport has to stop talking about consensus in the management of concussion and deliver consensus.\u201d", "description": "The need for further research into football\u2019s dementia link is indisputable but, for Dr Willie Stewart, the lead investigator in the University of Glasgow\u2019s groundbreaking new study, there is another pressing imperative.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000116816897-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
