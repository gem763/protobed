'\n\nIt's unclear whether the company can sustain the practice of shipping out products at a loss or whether merchants will ultimately reap the benefits (Stock image)\n\nThough convenient for customers and brands looking to expand their market through Amazon, it's unclear how sustainable the company's new policy will be.\n\nFor one, shipping costs far outweigh the value of sending off a single toothbrush to a customer, meaning Amazon is likely losing money on every product sold under its new policy.\n\nRecode also notes that Amazon has a habit of pressuring its merchants for reimbursement if products sold through the platform end up losing the company money.\n\n'It\u2019s been great for the manufacturers; they\u2019re experiencing sales growth,' Andrea Leigh, a former Amazon executive told Recode.\n\n'But I want to warn them all not to get too comfortable. In six months, Amazon is going to come back to you asking for money and could hold the brand hostage.'", "description": "The e-commerce giant has removed restrictions on its products that forbade customers from utilizing one-day shipping on items less than $5 and will now ship items that cost over $1.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/19/16503790-0-image-a-17_1571077552556.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
