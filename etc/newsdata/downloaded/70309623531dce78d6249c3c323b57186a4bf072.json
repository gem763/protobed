Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts red carpet in Dec. 2014. (Matt McClain/ The Washington Post)\n\nThe former lead makeup artist for Charlie Rose\u2019s namesake interview show has filed a lawsuit in New York\u2019s Supreme Court against the former television host, adding to a tally of dozens of women who say he abused his power and authority to sexually harass them.\n\nThe woman, Gina Riggi, claims that Rose \u201csubjected her to a pattern of misogynistic, abusive behavior\u201d and created a \u201ctoxic work environment suffused with sexual harassment and gender-based abuse\u201d for her and her female colleagues while they worked on the \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d show, which was broadcast on Bloomberg Television and PBS.\n\n[Charlie Rose\u2019s misconduct was widespread at CBS and three managers were warned, investigation finds]\n\nRiggi, 62, first joined \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d in 1995 and claims she quickly found herself trapped in an environment her complaint refers to as a \u201csexual hunting ground.\"\n\nNowhere was safe for the women who worked with Rose, according to Riggi\u2019s complaint. The harassment happened everywhere, she alleges, at his studio at Bloomberg, at his home in the Hamptons, in airplanes and limousines, at hotels and trendy restaurants. He would allegedly grope and paw at his female staff. He would allegedly stare at their breasts, look down their shirts and press himself against them.\n\nRiggi says she was targeted by the television host, but she also claims she witnessed him target young female journalists with particular fervor.\n\nRose has been accused of sexual harassment by dozens of women whose stories echo Riggi\u2019s. His behavior also allegedly extended to his work at CBS, where he co-hosted \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and occasionally anchored the network\u2019s \u201cEvening News.\u201d The network fired him after accusations of his sexual harassment became public, but a 2018 Washington Post investigation reported three occasions over 30 years in which network managers were warned about his behavior.\n\n[Read the investigation: Eight women say Charlie Rose sexually harassed them \u2014 with nudity, groping and lewd calls]\n\nA 2017 Washington Post investigation reported that eight women claimed Rose made unwanted sexual advances to them in the form of lewd phone calls, groping and appearing nude in front of them. An additional 27 women who worked with Rose at CBS and elsewhere came forward a few months later with similar allegations.\n\nIn May 2018, three women who had worked for Rose sued him as well as CBS, saying he subjected them to unwanted sexual touching, comments and harassment, according to their complaint. The case remains ongoing.\n\nThe \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d talk show was produced by Charlie Rose Inc. and WNET, and it aired on Bloomberg Television and PBS until November 2017, when it was canceled because of the allegations against the host. Riggi\u2019s complaint also names Bloomberg L.P. and Charlie Rose Inc. as defendants.\n\nShe claims Bloomberg knew about the harassment but failed to stop it, instead accommodating its star and his behavior. Riggi also says the network did not properly classify her as an employee but rather as an independent contractor, thereby denying her benefits, sick leave and other forms of compensation.\n\nRiggi\u2019s lawyer, Patrick J. Walsh, said in a statement that \u201cBloomberg, Charlie Rose and his company jointly employed Ms. Riggi for her entire tenure on the show. Bloomberg and Rose completely controlled and directed her work, and benefited from her loyal service for 22 years. But by misclassifying her as an independent contractor, they denied her the compensation, benefits and other protections they provided to the rest of their employees on the show.\u201d\n\nAfter Rose\u2019s show was canceled, Riggi alleges she was let go from Bloomberg without severance or other unemployment benefits because she had been classified as an independent contractor. She is seeking damages and equitable relief for the harm she claims she endured emotionally and financially working for Rose.\n\n\u201cWe understand that the plaintiff was a contractor of Charlie Rose Inc., and given that they operated independently of us, any of her compensation would have been handled solely by Charlie Rose Inc.,\" Bloomberg spokesman Ty Trippet said in a statement. Trippet later added that Riggi was never a Bloomberg employee.\n\nRose\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan Bach, said in a statement that \u201cMr. Rose vehemently denies and will vigorously contest these allegations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong other things,\u201d Bach continued, \u201cthe allegations in the complaint are completely inconsistent with written statements made by the plaintiff to Mr. Rose, including \u2018I love working for you at your show, and would love to be part of any show that you host\u2019, \u2018I consider it an honor to be a member of your team,\u2019 and \u2018hope to see you more often! Please stop by anytime [smiling emoji].\u201d\n\nBach said the emails were sent by Riggi between 2010 and 2012.\n\nAccording to Riggi\u2019s complaint, the abuse was verbal and physical at times, not just sexual. As a makeup artist, she often found herself in proximity to Rose, touching up his makeup and preparing guests for the cameras. The lawsuit claims he often became agitated during this process, berating her and swatting her hand away. Sometimes, she says, he made derisive comments about her weight in front of other staff members.\n\nIn one instance, Riggi says Rose \u201cbecame upset\u201d while she applied his makeup and \u201cforcefully grabbed and twisted her arm, physically hurting her.\u201d\n\nRiggi says she reported the conduct to \u201ca number of Bloomberg supervisors,\u201d who she claims did nothing in response. After that incident, Rose allegedly asked for young women with no makeup experience to tend to his appearance, rather than Riggi.\n\nHer dressing room became a safe space for the young women who were allegedly subjected to Rose\u2019s sexual misconduct, the complaint says. Riggi\u2019s suit relays the stories of several young female assistants and employees whom the lawsuit does not name because they have not publicly come forward.\n\nRiggi also says she witnessed or was told firsthand about Rose\u2019s interactions with women that went public, including Sarah Gordon, a former intern who alleged in November 2017 that Rose forced her to watch explicit sex scenes from a movie during one occasion when she delivered mail to his apartment.\n\nThat account is reiterated by Riggi, who claims in the lawsuit that Gordon complained to her about these delivery responsibilities. In one instance, Riggi says that Rose greeted Gordon in a towel after emerging from the shower, which prompted her to quickly leave.\n\nAmy Brittain contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nBoy Scouts failed to stop hundreds of previously unreported sexual predators, a lawsuit alleges\n\nWoman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32\n\nCalifornia professor, writer of confidential Brett Kavanaugh letter, speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault\n\nReview: How the New York Times broke Harvey Weinstein", "description": "Gina Riggi claims the disgraced television personality \u201csubjected her to a pattern of misogynistic, abusive behavior\u201d and created a \u201ctoxic work environment.\u201d", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk", "September At Pm", "Kayla Epstein Is The Social Media Editor For National At The Washington Post.
