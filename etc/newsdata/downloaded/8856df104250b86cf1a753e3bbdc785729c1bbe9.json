Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThe 2020 Group of Seven summit will be held at President Trump\u2019s own resort in South Florida, the White House announced Thursday, a decision that immediately prompted questions about Trump profiting off of the presidency.\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who announced the decision to hold the summit at the Trump National Doral Miami, said there will be no issue with that. \u201cThey\u2019re doing this at cost,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, it\u2019s actually dramatically cheaper for us to do it at Doral compared to the other final sites that we had.\u201d\n\nMulvaney repeatedly returned to this point as reporters asked him to explain why it\u2019s not improper for Trump to choose his own property for such an event. \u201cHe\u2019s not making any money off of this, just like he\u2019s not making any money off of working here,\u201d Mulvaney said shamelessly.\n\nBut there are ways for the Trump Organization to profit off of the G7 even if it\u2019s not making money from the event itself. Asked about the branding boost that the property will receive by hosting the event, Mulvaney brushed the concern aside. \u201cI would simply ask you all to consider the possibility that the Trump brand is probably strong enough as it is and he doesn\u2019t need any help on that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nMulvaney admitted to one reporter that he was skeptical himself of choosing the Trump-owned property for the event. But he soon became convinced that the property is the \u201cperfect\u201d to hold the summit. Trump, he said, knows he\u2019ll be criticized and doesn\u2019t care.\n\nIn fact, this was all Trump\u2019s idea, Mulvaney confirmed Thursday. The president publicly floated the idea of holding next year\u2019s G7 at Doral during this year\u2019s summit in France. One possible reason why? In the words of a consultant hired by the Trump Organization, it\u2019s \u201cseverely under-performing.\u201d", "description": "The White House shamelessly chose Trump\u2019s own Florida property to host next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit.", "authors": ["Adam K.
