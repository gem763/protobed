CT scans showed hazy abnormalities in their lungs, and many patients seemed to suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome, a condition in which fluid fills the tiny air sacs in the lungs and makes it difficult to get oxygen into a person\u2019s blood. The illnesses are thought to be some sort of inflammation or injury in the lungs due to chemical exposure.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What concerns or benefits do you see with e-cigarettes? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t identified an agent or agents that cause these illnesses,\u201d said Jonathan Meiman, chief medical officer at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. \u201cThe other side is just being able to clearly describe what\u2019s going on from a medical perspective. A lot of that work still needs to be done.\u201d\n\nThere are 380 confirmed or probable cases of vaping-related pulmonary illnesses, according to the most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThis week, the CDC shifted from reporting all potential cases under investigation to reporting just the confirmed and probable cases, creating a drop in the total number from the over 450 possible cases under investigation. The new number includes both the now-confirmed cases in the previous group and the newly reported confirmed cases from the past week. Six people have died.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has received more than 120 product samples linked to vaping illness for analysis. Many of the samples tested so far have contained tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, a chemical in marijuana known for its psychoactive effects, rather than nicotine. Most samples with THC also contained added vitamin E acetate, an oil sometimes found in dietary supplements and skin products, the agency said.\n\nBut no one product or device has been associated with all of the cases, according to the CDC and the FDA.\n\nRelated Video Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, invested almost $13 billion in e-cigarette company Juul.

Osipova/The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe FDA has warned consumers to avoid THC-containing vaping products. The CDC, as well as other health officials, providers and organizations, have cautioned people to steer clear of vaping altogether.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing what we believe to be a newly occurring pulmonary illness associated with e-cigarette products,\u201d said Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer at the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\nMany researchers and health-care providers have long had concerns about the health risks of e-cigarettes and vaping, particularly as young adults and teenagers increasingly took to the products. Users vape a range of substances from nicotine-laced liquids that can come in fruity flavors like mango to marijuana-based products. The patients are often young and relatively healthy.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration said it plans to ban all non-tobacco-flavored vaping products from the market, as health officials continue to investigate the illnesses.\n\nMany of the reported symptoms are typically a sign of infection or pneumonia, so some clinicians start patients on antibiotics to try to combat an infection. But often, patients don\u2019t get better on the antibiotics, or sometimes they get worse. According to a report on 53 patients in Illinois and Wisconsin, all of the patients who received antibiotics as outpatients had progressive symptoms and were eventually hospitalized.\n\n\u201cThey feel achy all over, and they feel terrible. They tell us they feel like they have the flu,\u201d said Dixie Harris, a pulmonologist at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, which has seen a number of cases. \u201cWe have protocols if we think it\u2019s a bacterial infection. We put them immediately on antibiotics. If they\u2019re extremely sick, they\u2019re admitted. And if it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s not an infection by blood work or cultures, we are putting them on steroids.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nSteroids are typically used to quell inflammation or allergic reactions in patients, and the drugs seem to clear the inflammation in the patients in a few days after being administered, physicians say.\n\nWhile there are common clinical symptoms among the patients, the cases aren\u2019t identical. Most patients seem to develop rapid symptoms, but others are more chronic over a span of weeks or months, and the level of severity also differs.\n\nMelodi Pirzada, chief of pediatric pulmonology at NYU Winthrop Hospital, saw two patients within the span of a week. One was an 18-year-old male who developed rapid symptoms and needed to be intubated and put on a ventilator to help him breathe. The second was a 19-year-old male who had more chronic symptoms, including losing 25 pounds over the course of three months, but he didn\u2019t require extra oxygen. Both of them reported vaping products containing THC.\n\nThe differences among patients aren\u2019t just external. A New England Journal of Medicine report looked at chest CT scans for 19 cases and saw imaging patterns that fit with acute eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, organizing pneumonia and lipoid pneumonia, with no one pattern across all of the scans.\n\nSome cases have been diagnosed as acute lipoid pneumonia, which is an inflammatory reaction to inhaling fat or oils, and have had noted fat buildup in their lungs. But once again, that doesn\u2019t apply to all of the patients, and the fat buildup isn\u2019t necessarily a sign of that condition, either.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple different patterns of injury,\u201d said Travis Henry, an associate professor of clinical radiology at the University of California, San Francisco and an author on the journal paper. \u201cNot every patient has the same response or reaction to it.\u201d\n\nWorking with state health departments, the CDC released a case definition of symptoms to help officials investigate probable and confirmed cases tied to vaping. A confirmed case describes a person who has vaped in the past 90 days presenting with haziness or opacities in their chest scans, and no signs of an infection or another plausible diagnosis.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to assume that every person who comes in with respiratory symptoms and a reported vaping history is suffering from a vape-related illness, Dr. Pirzada said. \u201cWe need to rule out every possibility before we make that call.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of vapers are getting sick and six have died, but doctors are struggling to isolate the nature of the mysterious lung ailments.", "authors": ["Brianna Abbott", "Brianna.Abbott Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106482/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
