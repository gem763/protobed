These manufacturers and wireless carriers tend to offer monthly payment plans to help people accept these high prices, but no matter how you slice it the price of flagships is still a deterrent for many folks.\n\nThankfully, there are some outstanding affordable alternatives and these alternatives have significantly improved over the past few years. Various manufacturers, including many from China and Korea, have compelling products that are becoming more popular as we reach smartphone saturation. Amazon has its Prime Exclusive Phones program that offers reasonable prices on current models and those that might be a year or two old, but are still a valuable option.\n\nIt's tough to justify a $1,100 iPhone XS Max as your first phone, but any of these following phones may be great to have as a second phone for the beach or forest, as a first phone for your teen, or in case of an emergency. These phones are in order from lowest to highest price.\n\n1. Coolpad Legacy for $129.99\n\nSee it now: Coolpad Legacy at MetroPCS\n\nThe new Coolpad Legacy, see my first take, is designed with a large display, huge capacity battery with Quick Charge 3.0, high-quality plastic and glass materials, a microSD expansion card, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and even launches with Android 9 Pie out of the box. There has to be trade-offs made at the $130 price, but it's hard to see where these compromises were made on the Coolpad Legacy.\n\nThe Coolpad Legacy is being offered for $129.99 at Metro by T-Mobile. This means you get service with no annual contracts on a pre-paid basis. This is a great first phone, one for someone who needs a phone to last a couple days, or someone who wants a big display that is easy to read.\n\nIt has modern features and solid design aspects while performing reliably to help you get things done. I am still stunned by the low price of this phone and did not expect it to be this good.\n\n2. LG K30 for $139.99\n\nSee it now: LG K30 at Amazon\n\nImage: LG\n\nThe LG K30 has a full retail price of $179.99 (or higher), but it is currently priced at just $139.99 on Amazon.\n\nThe LG K30 has a 5.3-inch display with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor, an 8-megapixel rear camera, 5-megapixel front-facing camera, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage with a microSD expansion card slot, rear fingerprint scanner, and a rather large 3,000mAh battery.\n\nThe K30 is priced at less than most insurance policies for flagship phones, so if you need a low cost phone or a backup, then this may be the one to consider.\n\n3. Apple iPhone SE (64GB) for $160\n\nSee it now: iPhone SE at Amazon\n\nYou probably didn't expect to ever see an Apple iPhone in this sub-$400 list, but the 64GB Apple iPhone SE is available now from Amazon in a couple of colors at various prices. You can also find 128GB models on Amazon.

Other specs include a rear 12-megapixel camera, a front 1.2-megapixel FaceTime HD camera, a fingerprint scanner integrated into the front home button, and 64GB of internal storage.\n\nThe Apple iPhone SE is powered by the Apple A9 chip and M9 motion coprocessor for a fast experiences with a standard 3.5mm headset jack still present on the phone.\n\n4.

I wrote a full review last year where I awarded it an 8.4/10 rating, and I know a couple of people that have been very pleased with my recommendation.\n\nIf you are looking to spend $200 or less, I highly recommend this phone as a first choice. You can find it in various colors, including a cool red.

Unihertz Atom for $259.99\n\nDuring the summer months I like to run, bike, hike, and swim so one phone I plan to pack along is the Unihertz Atom. It's one of the coolest phones I've ever tested with a diminuitive 2.45 inch display and dimensions of 96x45x18 mm with 108 grams. While it is very small, the touchscreen display is also functional.\n\nThis small phone has an IP68 dust and water resistant rating. The light weight and rugged enclosure means it can also take a bump or drop without a problem in most cases.\n\nA headphone jack is something we don't see on many phones today, but you will find it on the Unihertz Atom. A USB-C port is present, another feature we don't see on low price phones. This is not a phone for watching movies, but it will keep you connected in the woods, on the water, on the road, and wherever you may find yourself this summer.\n\n8.
