The Manchester City winger inspires fear and confusion in opponents. In the 4-0 victory over Bulgaria at Wembley he was a constant menace.\n\nHarry Kane might get all the goals \u2013 or at least it feels that way \u2013 but Sterling\u2019s inventiveness and trickery cause neurosis for defenders. His strange, unpredictable running style means even the best full backs struggle to read his changes of direction. Anton Nedyalkov is not a top-class left back. The Bulgarian had a torrid afternoon. Vasil Bozhikov, the centre half, tried to help his teammate but to no avail. The visiting side\u2019s midfield seemed to make a tactical decision not to get involved in the carnage on Sterling\u2019s wing. It was the easiest way to avoid embarrassment.\n\nEven when Sterling appears quiet it does not mean he is ineffective. He came in for criticism during the World Cup last year but good teams adjust their patterns to account for the 24-year-old. It is instructive to note that in the knockout matches in Russia, Colombia and Croatia only began to get a foothold in the game after Gareth Southgate had substituted the winger. Once Sterling had departed, the opposing midfielders could stop looking over their shoulders and worry about their own game.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Declan Rice pinged an overhit pass into the area within the first five minutes.\n\nRoss Barkley had more success, twisting free in a patch of space near the halfway line to fire a diagonal ball to Sterling. The winger\u2019s Bulgarian minders could not cope with the City man. His cross was perfect and Kane finished well but the captain had strayed offside and the effort was disallowed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Plamen Iliev was in a position to make a routine clearance when he looked up and saw the winger lurking just outside the six-yard box. The goalkeeper froze at the sight of the England man and rolled the ball compliantly to Sterling. This was all too easy. The winger stroked a pass to Kane, who could hardly miss.\n\nThe Tottenham Hotspur striker is England\u2019s main goal threat. Marcus Rashford talked before the game about needing to help out in that department. It\u2019s hard to see how the Manchester United forward can get on the scoresheet from his positon out wide.\n\nWhere Sterling looks in his element hugging the touchline, Rashford seems like a man in exile. He dropped back to supply a magnificent ball to release Danny Rose in the first half but this role does not play to his strengths. The 21-year-old works hard \u2013 he fell back into cover when Rose bombed on \u2013 but he rarely got into the box.\n\nWith Bulgaria paying so much attention to Sterling there should have been space on the opposite wing but England\u2019s passing was not crisp enough in midfield. It is a small complaint. Not so long ago Southgate\u2019s team were giving away possession in the middle of the park. Barkley, Rice and Henderson consistently found white shirts. If they can increase the tempo of their passing they will be even more effective.\n\nWhen Rashford did get into the box he caused problems. He drew a clumsy lunge from Nokolay Bodurov to earn a penalty which Kane dispatched as expected. Then he slipped a lovely ball through to Barkley, who was unable to cash in.\n\nRashford many not have the range available to Sterling but his pace does scare defenders. When Kane won possession in midfield and gave the ball to the Manchester United forward, Rashford\u2019s advance to the edge of the box had three Bulgaria defenders backpedalling nervously. His pass to Kane was perfect and the captain cut the ball back for Sterling to score.\n\nRashford did more than enough to justify his place but he did not provide much of a goal threat. In the final minutes he cut in from wide and drove into the area but the goalkeeper foiled his close-range chip. He deserved more.\n\nFor all his hard work, Rashford is under pressure. Jadon Sancho is waiting \u2013 literally \u2013 in the wings. The 19-year-old has the same flamboyant approach to running at defenders as Sterling. The Borussia Dortmund man wants to humiliate his opponents. The thought of two wingers bent on terrorising a back four is a seductive thought.\n\nWithout goals, there is a temptation to underestimate Rashford\u2019s role. No one could downplay Sterling\u2019s contribution, though. Kane gets all the goals but England\u2019s hopes lie at the winger\u2019s feet.", "description": "It is becoming increasingly clear that Raheem Sterling is England\u2019s most important player.
