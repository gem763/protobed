(AP) \u2014 New England Patriots receiver Antonio Brown\u2019s availability is again in limbo this week with the NFL preparing to meet with the former trainer that has filed a civil lawsuit accusing the star receiver of rape and sexual assault.\n\nOn Monday, the NFL declined to comment on the allegations against Brown or when it would speak with his accuser. But the league told the Patriots last week that it was opening an investigation into the matter.\n\nBrown has denied the allegations made in the lawsuit. Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, told The Associated Press his client plans to countersue.\n\nSports Illustrated also published a story Monday afternoon in which a second woman, an unnamed artist, alleged that Brown exposed himself to her while she was working on a mural for him at his Pittsburgh home in 2017.\n\nIn a statement issued Monday via Twitter, Heitner said Brown also denies the allegation made in the SI story.\n\n\u201cAntonio Brown has reviewed the sexual misconduct allegations made by an unnamed artist included in a recently published Sports Illustrated article and denies that he ever engaged in such activities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere will be no further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nBrown has not spoken publicly since the lawsuit was filed and he did not address reporters leading up to the game against the Dolphins. He also was not made available following the Miami game and was not present in the locker room during a player availability on Monday.\n\nThe Patriots resume practice Wednesday.\n\nAsked during his Monday morning conference call if he expected to hear anything from the NFL about Brown\u2019s availability this week, Patriots coach Bill Belichick said, \u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just answer any questions about the game, and I\u2019m not getting into anything else outside of that right now,\u201d Belichick said.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed by Brown\u2019s former trainer Britney Taylor last week in Florida , she alleges Brown sexually assaulted her on three occasions. According to the lawsuit, Taylor says she was sexually assaulted by Brown on separate training trips to Pittsburgh and Florida that same month in 2017. It also alleges he forcibly raped her in 2018. The suit includes what it says are text messages from Brown bragging about the second assault.\n\nThe AP does not usually name the alleged victims of sex assaults, but Taylor was identified in the federal lawsuit and was quoted in a statement provided by her lawyer, David Haas.\n\nThough the allegations made by Taylor against Brown made him subject to discipline under the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy, he played and scored a touchdown on Sunday during the Patriots\u2019 43-0 win at Miami. Two sources told The Associated Press that Brown was not placed on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list last week and was eligible to play because no criminal charges had been filed against him and because the NFL hadn\u2019t fully developed its investigation.\n\nPlayers on the exempt list can\u2019t play in games or practice with a team but are still paid. A player can be placed on the exempt list at any point. The one-year deal Brown signed earlier this month with the Patriots could be worth as much as $15 million.\n\nThe 31-year-old Brown was released by Oakland on Sept. 7 after clashing with the team throughout training camp. He agreed to a contract with New England that same day.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "Sports Illustrated published a story Monday afternoon in which a second woman, an unnamed artist, alleged that Brown exposed himself to her in 2017.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8056f13b00002b88d4b536.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
