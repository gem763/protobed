There were no tales of conscience-wrestling, no deep explanation of how Trump had won them over, just brief statements of defiance: \u201cThere\u2019s too many immigrants... Hillary\u2019s a liar... he\u2019ll stuff China... we want our jobs back.\u201d\n\nAnswers that were variations of three-word soundbites Trump had drummed into their heads at rallies. Short, sharp slogans that spoke to their gut instincts: \u201cBuild the wall... lock her up... drain the swamp... Make America Great.\u201d\n\nAll sold to them by a practised con man who painted himself as a reg\u2019lar kinda guy despite being a billionaire property magnate who was about as reg\u2019lar as the Sultan of Brunei.\n\nThey say that when America sneezes, Britain catches a cold, and so the dreaded three-word disease, which kills all known brain cells, was bound to reach here. We saw the symptoms during the EU referendum with Take Back Control but at this week\u2019s Tory conference there was a full-blown outbreak.\n\nBoris Johnson didn\u2019t bother crafting a proper maiden speech as party leader, outlining a personal vision or original policies. He just rehashed stale jokes and massaged the Tory law \u2018n\u2019 order G-spot, but mostly he went for the Trumpian three-word triple-score with constant references to The Surrender Act, Unite The Country and the Get Brexit Done.\n\nEven though many of us watching were thinking No Parliamentary Majority, Lied To Queen and Petrified Of Farage.\n\nJohnson now even refers to himself in three words, The Incredible Hulk, and ignores tough questions by emoting in three-word distractions \u201clet\u2019s think positive\u201d. And the only memorable clip of the week came from an aide\u2019s three-word warning: \u201cNo. Disposable. Cups\u201d.\n\nAs in America, \u00adargument and intellect have been sacrificed at the altar of emotion. The language of Shakespeare and Dickens and the oratory of Bevan and Churchill are distant memories.\n\nDebate is the enemy of the people. Why else did Johnson want to close down Parliament?\n\nWe\u2019re living in a post-reason world. When the British and American leaders open their mouths we don\u2019t believe a word that leaves them. We know it\u2019s fiction. They know we know it\u2019s fiction. But it doesn\u2019t matter to them. It\u2019s all part of a game which aims to mesmerise the lowest common denominator.\n\nThey even have a shared list of shame: grope allegations from young women who were working for them, affairs with busty blondes on the make, racist and sexist comments passed off as \u00adbar-room banter, serious accusations brazenly dismissed as fake news or the work of foreign colluders.\n\nAnd their core base loves them even more for it. As Katie Hopkins said of journalist Charlotte Edwardes\u2019 claim that Johnson groped her: \u201cIf Boris had squeezed my upper thigh 20 years ago I still wouldn\u2019t have showered. Better to be grabbed by the p***y than have a p***y as Prime Minister.\u201d\n\nNo language can educate a mind that polluted. It\u2019s why, like Trump, none of the Johnson scandal sticks. In a three-word world minds quickly move on.\n\nOur only hope is that even the thickest voters see through them and turn their three-word phrases into two.\n\nOnes that begin and end in F.", "description": "They say that when America sneezes, Britain catches a cold, and so the dreaded three-word disease, which kills all known brain cells, was bound to reach here", "authors": ["Brian Reade", "Image", "Empics Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20422426.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Prime-Minister-Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
