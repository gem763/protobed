Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) late Thursday charged that Zuckerberg\u2019s speech \u201cshows how little he has learned from 2016,\u201d when Russian agents spread propaganda to influence the last presidential race, \u201cand how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFacebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation,\u201d she added in a series of tweets. \u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again \u2014 and profit off of it.\u201d\n\nThis month, Facebook declined to take down an ad from Trump\u2019s campaign that contained falsehoods about former vice president Joe Biden, prompting widespread criticism from the party. Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, which had requested its removal, similarly expressed outrage with Zuckerberg after his Georgetown speech. Biden spokesman Bill Russo said in a statement that the Facebook leader cloaked company policy \u201cin a feigned concern for free expression.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s remarks Thursday were a rare, public attempt to explain his vision of free expression in the digital age. He called on the United States to set an example for tailored regulation, and stressed that Facebook must stand strong against governments that seek to \u201cpull back\u201d on free speech in the face of heightened social and political tensions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn doing so, Zuckerberg defended the company\u2019s policy around political ads. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the right place on this,\u201d he told The Washington Post in an interview before his address. \u201cIn general, in a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying.\"\n\nZuckerberg presented his beliefs \u2014 that societies tend to regret the instances in which they limit one\u2019s right to express their views \u2014 through the lens of history, at one point citing King, his letter from Birmingham jail and his arrests for peaceful protest.\n\nBut the Facebook leader\u2019s remarks soon raised eyebrows with a member of King\u2019s family: his daughter, Bernice King. The civil rights leader tweeted she hoped to help Zuckerberg \u201cunderstand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\u201d adding that such campaigns \u201ccreated an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWriting in The Post, Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, raised additional alarms, saying she feared Zuckerberg is \u201cill-equipped\u201d to address the threat of voter suppression. She cited the attempts by Russian agents during the 2016 election to divide Facebook users on issues of race, specifically targeting African American users, and she highlighted the possibility that a politician could try to discourage turnout among people of color.\n\nIn response, Facebook said Friday it plans to host Bernice King for meetings at its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters next week. \u201cTheir perspectives are critically important and we are committed to continuing the ongoing dialogue,\u201d Roberta Thomson, a spokeswoman for the tech giant, said about the reaction from civil rights leaders. \u201cOur work is far from over.\u201d\n\nFree speech advocates, meanwhile, exited Zuckerberg\u2019s speech with conflicting feelings \u2014 supportive of his clarion call for governments and private-sector companies to help users express themselves while questioning whether the tech giant\u2019s policies meet its top executive\u2019s own vision.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sitting and talking to American college students at Georgetown, but who\u2019s he really talking to \u2014 it\u2019s live-streamed around the world \u2014 is a global audience,\u201d said Kate Klonick, a fellow at the Information Society Project at Yale Law School who is studying Facebook\u2019s work. \u201cI think, at the end of the day, that is a good thing.\u201d\n\nBut Klonick said the reality is more complicated, pointing to the fact that some researchers feel Facebook \u201cis not consistent\u201d when it comes to enforcing its own rules.\n\nFacebook maintains detailed policies prohibiting harmful content, including hate speech, terrorist propaganda and violent imagery. Rebecca MacKinnon, director of Ranking Digital Rights, a nonprofit research initiative at New America\u2019s Open Technology Institute, said Facebook had been too opaque about how those standards are enforced. She pointed to her organization\u2019s 2019 report, which found Facebook provided too little detail about content it removes at the requests of governments or third parties, including on the two other social services it owns, WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe glossed over a lot of issues that relate to how speech is organized, optimized, and moderated on the platform currently,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has huge impact on society and on human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it pushes organizations and individuals and whomever to hold Facebook accountable on this,\u201d added Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cYou talk the talk, and now you\u2019ve got to walk the walk.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg drew fresh ire from Democratic presidential candidates, free speech experts and civil rights advocates, who argued his speech in Washington this week failed to acknowledged the troubles with the tech giant\u2019s practices.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/El3dfL_RC3FFh0UgPHZx4EQWD6c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BLCYTNXRE4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
