Her successor at Sonangol, Carlos Saturnino, accused dos Santos last year of authorizing the transfer to a company in Dubai days after she was dismissed as chairwoman. Saturnino was sacked in May.\n\n\u201cTo say there was a transfer order after my dismissal is simply false,\u201d dos Santos said in statement emailed on Monday. \u201cThe fight against corruption can\u2019t be used to feed an agenda of persecution or a witch hunt.\u201d\n\nDos Santos said the fund-transfer was legal and was made while she was still in her position at Sonangol on Nov. 15, 2017, the day she was dismissed and before a new board was appointed the next day. She said payment instructions were given one or two days before her dismissal.\n\nIf Angolan authorities are serious about fighting corruption they should investigate why Sonangol had about $20 billion in debt at the end of 2015, before her appointment, and how this money was \u201cused and lost,\u201d said the 46-year-old dos Santos.\n\nDos Santos was dismissed as head of Sonangol amid a crackdown on corruption by Joao Lourenco, who replaced her father as president in 2017. Sonangol, long the main engine of Angola\u2019s oil-focused economy, has been at the center of Lourenco\u2019s anti-graft campaign.\n\n(Adds dos Santos\u2019s comment about timing of payment instructions in fourth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Henrique Almeida in Lisbon at halmeida5@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joao Lima at jlima1@bloomberg.net, Rene Vollgraaff, Alastair Reed\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Isabel dos Santos, Africa\u2019s richest woman and the daughter of former Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, said she did nothing wrong when she was chairwoman of state-owned oil company Sonangol and called a probe into the transfer of millions of dollars from the Luanda-based firm", "authors": ["Henrique Almeida"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MAQ1GaAUwydav3ueqIzQ3g--~B/aD0xMzY4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1a5b78e1f9e9726f546156434267f5e1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
