The completed project is next to the new North Ryde metro station.", "description": "The group has been undertaking a review of its international development and site-buying strategies in the past year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8f9f7a9985c1709f9036d355b216bf64f909dfbd", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
