During the 12-week trial, half of the participants took 14mg of LactoLycopene \u2013 created by supplement manufacturer Cambridge Nutraceuticals Ltd \u2013 and the other half took dummy pills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it was a double-blind randomised trial, neither the researchers nor the volunteers knew who was taking LactoLycopene and who was receiving the placebo.\n\nThe team analysed the sperm samples collected at the beginning and end of the trial.\n\nThose taking LactoLycopene had almost 40% more fast-swimming sperm with improvements to sperm size and shape, the researchers said.\n\nProfessor Allan Pacey, head of the University of Sheffield\u2019s department of oncology and metabolism and lead author, said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t really expect that at the end of the study there would be any difference in the sperm from men who took the tablet versus those who took the placebo.\n\n\u2018When we decoded the results, I nearly fell off my chair.\n\n\u2018The improvement in morphology \u2013 the size and shape of the sperm \u2013 was dramatic.\u2019\n\nScientists from the University of Sheffield believe lycopene could boost sperm count (Shutterstock / Christoph Burgstedt)\n\nStudy co-author Dr Liz Williams, a specialist in human nutrition at the University of Sheffield, said while she was \u2018surprised\u2019 by the improvements in the sperm quality in the experiments, further research is needed with a larger study sample.\n\nDr Williams added: \u2018This was a small study and we do need to repeat the work in bigger trials, but the results are very encouraging. The next step is to repeat the exercise in men with fertility problems and see if LactoLycopene can increase sperm quality for those men and whether it helps couples conceive and avoid invasive fertility treatments.\u2019\n\nProf Pacey said the work, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, did not investigate how lycopene helped boost overall sperm quality but believes the compound\u2019s antioxidant properties could be preventing sperm from becoming damaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommenting on the research, Sheena Lewis, emeritus professor of reproductive medicine at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, who was not involved in the study, said: \u2018This is a small study where the volunteers were healthy, not infertile, with sperm parameters close to normal.\n\n\u2018Hence it is difficult to extrapolate any lycopene benefits to infertile men with poor semen quality. There are no clinical outcomes to the study.\u2019\n\nYing Cheong, professor of reproductive medicine at University of Southampton, said: \u2018This study, undoubtedly, will add to our current knowledge of yet another antioxidant type supplement on sperm parameters, but what the study fails to tell us is if taking LactoLycopene supplements improves fertility, that is, the chance of actually having a successful pregnancy.\n\n\u2018It would be more impactful if the authors could use live birth as the end point.\u2019", "description": "Lycopene also gives tomatoes their red colour", "authors": ["Metro Science Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_84569696_1570603834.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
