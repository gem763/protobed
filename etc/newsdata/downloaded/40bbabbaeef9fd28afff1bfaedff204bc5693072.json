This seems like a very coordinated attack and ambush on Trump and America. This conspiracy began about the time the democrat first hoax collapsed with the Mueller report. If they couldn't prove any Russian collusion, then about about Ukrainian? How to nail Trump on something though was the problem. There was a deep stater or two from the CIA who had heard the call and after at first dismissing it as a perfectly fine and acceptable conversation between two world leaders, upon further brainstorming among like minded deep staters the thought occurred that perhaps they could blow what was said out of all proportion. After all they have the media as their closest allies. So, then the Democrat/Media Axis of Evil jumped into operation. First the political and governmental apparatus had to do its job. The rewriting of \"whistleblower\" rules had to be completed that would allow gossip, hearsay, media reports and even wild fantasies to be valid to investigate. A couple of Trump's own appointees had to be involved in approving the final wording. Whether they just rubber stamped what was placed before them after a casual review or are part of the deep state apparatus is not known at this point. Then the actual complaint. Reading it one immediately gets the impression that one person did not write it, it smacks of a work by committee. It is entirely likely that it was written with consultation with members of congress. Schiff -head though seems so unstable that it's possible he wasn't involved. As the IG and others at the CIA scratched their heads after the submittal of the allegations and delayed, especially considering that a number of the allegations patently false and it seemed to be a collection of hearsay, media reports and democrat fantasies, it was necessary for the media to start doing their party. The talking points were all put out on the \"journolist\" hotline and the DMAE media wing sprang into action. The politicians then did their part so that both wings in concert stirred the pot and brought us to where we were two weeks ago. Of course the democrat leadership, Pelosi and others were primed this time to roll the dice for impeachment even before the complaint was \"known\", simply because they knew exactly what was in it. Knowing that the true law is about to upset the democrat applecart with the IG and federal prosecutors' reports on the democrat crime cabal, Pelosi and the dems feel they have to choice. Somehow they've got to try to convince the American people that Trump is the real crook and any charges against them are just politics. Fortunately, the American people are now wise to them, up to speed. The democrats lies, hoaxes and dirty tricks will come to naught.
