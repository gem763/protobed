As even when the two sides have reached a consensus, the US authorities later deny it.\n\nOver the past year any trust seemingly built up in the talks has been subsequently rendered null and void by the US administration raising or imposing new tariffs on Chinese products and sanctioning Chinese enterprises and individuals.\n\nAnd this time, as on previous occasions, Washington has sought to apply pressure just before the talks formally start in a bid to gain concessions.\n\nIf Washington continues its practice of attacking while talking, even if there is some agreement reached in the talks this week, Beijing will naturally wonder whether Washington will abide by it, or view it as a sign it can get more.\n\nYet the purchasing managers index of the US manufacturing industry dropped to 47.8 percent in September, from 49.1 in August, a new low since June 2009, indicating US manufacturers are feeling the effects of the trade frictions, and fueling concerns the US may be heading for a recession.\n\nThe trade frictions have worsened for more than a year, during which many countries besides China and the US have felt the effects. But China has no choice but to resolutely stand its ground if the United States did not give up its unreasonable demands.\n\nChina has always adhered to its principle of solving differences through equal-footed consultations based on mutual respect. This will not change whatever pressure the US applies.\n\nThe country has made thorough preparations for this week's talks. No matter what happens, it will engage in the talks with sincerity but there should be no doubt that it remains committed to safeguarding its core national interests and will not give in to unreasonable demands.", "description": "While there is a general feeling that a solution to the long-running trade dispute between China and the United States might be on the cards after both sides made conciliatory gestures ahead of the upcoming high-level negotiations due to begin in Washington on Thursday, it would be rash to consider that a certainty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/08/5d9c80e8a310cf3e97a023f3.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
