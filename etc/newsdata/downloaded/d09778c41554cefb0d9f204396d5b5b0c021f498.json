In 2014, Burisma paid Hunter Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s son, tens of thousands of dollars to sit on its board despite the younger Biden\u2019s complete lack of expertise or professional experience running a multi-national oil and gas concern.\n\nKent told lawmakers on Tuesday that the Obama administration spearheaded the efforts to have Shokin removed from his position as the top federal prosecutor in Ukraine. Kent said the international community \u2014 namely the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Western nations within the European Union \u2014 were deferential to U.S. directives on the matter. At a 2018 event organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, Joe Biden \u2014 who was tasked by then-President Barack Obama to lead the U.S. government\u2019s efforts in Ukraine \u2014 bragged about threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government refused to fire Shokin.\n\n\u201cI said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours,\u2019\u201d Biden recalled. \u201cIf the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nAfter Shokin was fired, he was replaced by Yuri Lutsenko, who also has been dogged by allegations of corruption. The Obama administration never demanded Lutsenko\u2019s ouster, despite worries that Lutsenko was similarly corrupt and untrustworthy.\n\nAllies of Biden, who is currently vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, have defended the former vice president from charges of improperly taking official actions that could financially benefit his son by claiming that the international community, rather than Biden and the Obama administration, were behind the efforts to get rid of Shokin. Kent\u2019s testimony, however, indicates it was Biden and the Obama administration who were running the show, not the so-called international community.\n\nKent also testified that concerns about corruption within Burisma, where Hunter Biden inexplicably served as a highly paid board member for five years, were openly voiced long before Trump became president. According to Kent, he personally raised red flags about a 2016 initiative between the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Burisma due to concerns the company was tied to government corruption in the country. Kent testified that USAID was gearing up for an event with Burisma that involved children, and that he felt uncomfortable seeing children used as photo op props for a company with a reputation for corruption and graft.\n\nKent\u2019s testimony was demanded by House Democrats as part of their long-running attempts to overturn the 2016 election results and remove Trump from office. Although Democrats claim their hearings are part of a formal impeachment investigation, party leaders have steadfastly refused to hold a vote on the matter authorizing an impeachment investigation. As a result, numerous top Trump administration officials have refused to appear before the Democratic inquisition, citing a lack of legal authority for Democrats\u2019 efforts.", "description": "A top U.S. diplomat testified yesterday that the Obama admin orchestrated the ouster of the Ukraine prosecutor investigating a Biden-connected company.", "authors": ["Sean Davis"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.40.17-PM-e1571244070348.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
