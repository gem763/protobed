Our citizens are being deceived into working on cruise liners and yachts, and then are forced, under penalty of death, to smuggle illegal migrants across the sea to Europe. That is why hundreds of Ukrainian sailors have been detained,\u201d lamented Liudmyla Denisova, the human rights commissioner for the Ukrainian parliament, or Verkhovna Rada, in 2018.\n\nThe October 23rd police statement confirms that there are now \u201cabout 300\u201d Ukrainians being \u201cpunished\u201d in Italy and Greece for offences related to people-smuggling.\n\nFrance Admits There Is 'Real Collusion' Between People-smugglers and Migrant 'Rescue' NGOs https://t.co/NGgHZRSIns \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 7, 2019\n\nThe Ukrainian authorities also reported having \u201cdetained a militant\u201d from Somalia who they found attempting to cross from Russian-occupied Crimea into the part of Ukraine still controlled by Kyiv. While much of the world has not recognized Russia\u2019s invasion and attempted annexation of Crimea, Ukrainian forces have failed to expel the occupying for from the region and impose Ukrainian law.\n\nItalian Secret Service: People-Smugglers May Arrange Mass Drowning for Public Sympathy https://t.co/9WsQ20Hhtu \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 24, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "Ukraine uncovered a people-smuggling network which has been picking up illegal migrants from Turkey in yachts and ferrying them to the EU.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/ukraine-police-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
