After a 2-2 draw in the Netherlands, Pochettino admitted his side\u2019s Champions League campaign was \u201cnearly over.\u201d\n\nYet, eight months later, the Argentine had led Tottenham to their first ever Champions League final.\n\nThe hangover from defeat to Liverpool in that final in Madrid has been long and sobering. Spurs have won just three of their opening 12 games in all competitions this season.\n\nChances of a first trophy under Pochettino in the League Cup have already gone after an embarrassing exit on penalties to fourth-tier Colchester and they are already five points off the pace just for a place in the Premier League\u2019s top four.\n\nHowever, Pochettino admitted that the most damaging defeat of all came last time out in the Champions League, when Bayern Munich ran riot in the second-half to leave London 7-2 winners.\n\n\u201cAfter Bayern Munich our confidence was on the floor,\u201d said Pochettino after a 1-1 draw at home to the Premier League\u2019s bottom club Watford on Saturday.\n\nThe heaviest defeat ever suffered at home by an English side in European competition may have had a lasting effect, but it is not terminal to Tottenham\u2019s chances of again pulling themselves off the canvas and into the Champions League last 16.\n\nBeat the Serbian champions at home on Tuesday and they will move into second place in Group B, as long as Olympiakos don\u2019t shock Bayern in Greece.\n\n\u2013 Spent force? \u2013\n\nDoubt has been cast over Pochettino\u2019s capability to rouse another response from largely the same group of players into his sixth season in charge.\n\nHe certainly does not have troubles to seek. Captain Hugo Lloris is sidelined until 2020 leaving substitute goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga to hold the fort at the back.\n\nCentre-back pairing Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld look to heading towards the end of their Tottenham careers with both the Belgians\u2019 contracts expiring at the end of the season.\n\nChristian Eriksen has also been in and out of the team with the Dane also likely to leave next summer if not before in January.\n\nNew signings Ryan Sessegnon and Giovani lo Celso are not yet close to a return to first-team action after lengthy injury layoffs and club record buy Tanguy Ndombele was left on the bench for the visit of Watford after an inconsistent start to his Spurs career.\n\nHowever, Pochettino was encouraged by his side\u2019s response in the second half against the Hornets as they fought back from 1-0 down to level thanks to Dele Alli\u2019s first goal since January.\n\n\u201cIt was so important in the way that we achieved the point in the end, the team was fighting, we showed character,\u201d said Pochettino.\n\n\u201cWe have quality but when you are in this type of situation the most important thing is the character you need to show.\n\n\u201cTalent is after, you need to fight and you need to run and you need to be strong in your mind, the effort is double.\n\n\u201cWhen everything is good you fly, when everything is going against you need to be so strong and you spend a lot of energy.\u201d\n\nRed Star\u2019s visit will give another indication as to whether Pochettino\u2019s men have the energy to rise again or really are a spent force.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Tottenham\u2019s miserable start to the season shows little sign of improving quickly, but prior to Red Star Belgrade\u2019s visit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/4ad2ae_pointing-in-direction-mauricio-pochettino-is-hoping-tottenham-slowly-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
