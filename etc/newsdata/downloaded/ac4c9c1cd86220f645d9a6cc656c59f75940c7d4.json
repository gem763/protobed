We have loads of animatronics and smoke. There is also a pirate room.\n\nWould you brave it? (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThe butcher\u2019s quarters (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t have things or people that jump out, they just move slightly. Last year we had costumes that we stuffed and this year people will be in them, there will be ten of us hiding around the house this time.\u2019\n\nIt all started out for Rod as a bit of fun, but when people started asking where they could put donations, he decided to give any money people wanted to leave to the Cornwall Air Ambulance Service.\n\nIt\u2019s taken off so much that he has to inform the emergency services and bus companies beforehand, as thousands of people turn up to be part of the experience and there can be congestion.\n\nAs well as the specialist props, Rod has made lots of extras himself (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThe terrifying volunteers (Picture: SWNS)\n\nIn an odd turn of events, Rod actually doesn\u2019t like horror movies, so the ideas for the themed rooms have come all from his own imagination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the 2019 festivities, he and his friends began setting up the whole thing three weeks ago, and it\u2019s been an expensive process.\n\n\u2018A friend gave us lots of stuff from America last year but in total we spent around \u00a313,000 \u2013 it\u2019s like Christmas,\u2019 Rod said.\n\nHe added: \u2018My wife and my lad help me with the decorations. I put little snippets on Facebook before we hold our open house.\u2019\n\nAnd, although he says that the whole thing is too frightening for little ones, it appears the younger members of his own family enjoy the whole thing. Rod said: \u2018One of my grandchildren was actually born on October 31 \u2013 so they ended up thinking the decorations and visitors were in their honour.\u2019\n\nMORE: Teenage sisters wear wedding dresses to have their \u2018first dances\u2019 with terminally ill dad\n\nMORE: Would you buy this \u00a360,000 belt made of platinum, gold, and diamonds?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "55-year-old Rod Dawson has spent a small fortune making his home as spooky as possible, all to raise money for charities.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93555525_1572365781.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
