Ball! Trophy!\n\nNaturally, the Dancing with the Stars premiere meant that Bachelor in Paradise took a night off, and several of the show's cast members were seen cheering on Hannah in the audience. Except, lol, no they weren't! You'd think ABC would have a fledgling understanding of who their own reality stars are, but for whatever reason our beloved Bachelor in Paradise cast was mislabeled by some poor editor, who, quite frankly, HAD ONE JOB.\n\nInstead, the camera panned over to some total randoms in the audience who were described as \"Cast of Bachelor in Paradise.\" And Twitter simply couldn't help but go off.\n\nGonna go out in a limb and say that this is not the cast of #BachelorInParadise #DWTS pic.twitter.com/ScUXUcf4sY \u2014 Car Maximus (@cmaxx94) September 17, 2019\n\nI\u2019m not sure what season of BIP I\u2019ve been watching these past few weeks, but it sure isn\u2019t this one. #BachelorInParadise #DWTS pic.twitter.com/tthjLadRsN \u2014 Kristen (@kford68) September 17, 2019\n\n#DWTS wow so many new arrivals on the beach this week! #bachelorinparadise pic.twitter.com/JsiRNqIlGb \u2014 Billy Ocean (@cloudfloating47) September 17, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANYWAY, Hannah killed it last night despite the fact that her Bachelor Nation co-stars morphed into completely different people\u2014and if you noticed that she had vibes with her dance parter Alan Bersten, you are not alone. The internet fully wants them to get together, but Hannah attempted to low-key shut down rumors, saying \"Look, we're having a great time,\" while Alan was just all \"I want her to fall in love with dancing!\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "You had one job, ABC.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rq4aP0cIJblOogJEWzOSrw--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/good_housekeeping_561/df3418124f87278116fe24cbdd51a6fb", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
