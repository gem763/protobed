Lately, we\u2019ve been seeing shops get more creative with their recipes.\n\nNot only can you get traditional lotus seed paste and salted egg yolk-filled pastries, but now you can find anything from lava matcha mooncakes to ones filled with spicy chicken floss (yes, really!) and nuts.\n\nWith less than a week away from the festival, we decided to try out five of the more interesting flavours on the market. Here\u2019s what we thought.\n\nVideo of Hong Kong modern mooncake taste testing\n\nSaint Honore Ovaltine One Bite Snowy Mooncake\n\nThese bite-sized mooncakes are, first of all, adorable. And when we saw that they were Ovaltine flavoured, we had to try them. Snowy mooncakes, which first appeared on the market in the early 1980s, are chilled and not baked. We were disappointed that the mooncakes did not taste very much like the powdered drink, but it was nonetheless very chocolatey. While, overall, they had quite a creamy consistency, they also had some crunchy bits which we enjoyed.\n\nPrice: HK$36 for a box of four\n\nAverage rating: 3/5\n\n15 things you didn't know about the Moon just in time for Mid-Autumn Festival\n\nPineapple Canteen Pineapple Bun Mooncake\n\nIt\u2019s shaped like a mooncake, we\u2019ll give them that. But really, it\u2019s more of a pineapple cake. The pastry and filling are almost identical to the Taiwanese cakes, only it was topped with the kind of sugary crust you would find on a classic Hong Kong boh loh bao. The filling was a little too sweet and sticky for us, but if you\u2019re a fan of the pineapple-y pastry it\u2019s trying to mimic, you might still want to give it a try.\n\nPrice: HK$25 for one\n\nAverage rating: 2.5/5\n\nArome Lava Matcha Mooncake\n\nHong Kong has long been on the matcha craze train. You can get it in ice cream, egg waffles, and pancakes. Now, you can even get matcha-flavoured mooncakes. They are a rich green colour inside and out, and when cut in half, all the matcha goodness comes oozing onto your plate. The filling surrounding the lava centre is very dense and dry, which we suppose the gooey \u201clava\u201d was meant to counterbalance, but all you end up with is a thick and stodgy paste in your mouth. Matcha lovers will enjoy the flavour of these mooncakes, but we recommend taking small bites at a time, and perhaps a hot cup of green tea to go with it.\n\nPrice: HK$185 for a box of six\n\nAverage rating: 3/5\n\nThis Mid-Autumn Festival, learn all about the ancient Chinese tradition of writing riddles on lanterns - and solve some yourself\n\nKFC Spicy Chicken and Nuts Mooncake\n\nThis one really pushes the envelope when it comes to putting a twist on the traditional mooncake, but trust KFC to be the one to create one filled with chicken. If you\u2019re brave enough to try it, your taste buds will be met with a mixture of sweet, salty and spicy ingredients \u2013 namely chicken floss, almonds, sunflower seeds and peaches. It\u2019s not as bad as it sounds, but we weren\u2019t fans.\n\nPrice: HK$199 for a bucket of six\n\nAverage rating: 2/5\n\nMrs Fields Chocolate Mooncake\n\nThis mooncake is certainly a decadent one, and we expected nothing less from Mrs Fields. Like the Pineapple Bun Mooncake, the only resemblance it has to a mooncake is its shape. It tasted more like a fudge brownie or raw cookie dough \u2013 which we\u2019re not complaining about! The price for one is rather hefty, but because it\u2019s so rich in chocolate flavour, you could definitely split the mooncake between a few friends or family members.\n\nPrice: HK$80 for one\n\nAverage rating: 3.5/5\n\nEdited by M.
