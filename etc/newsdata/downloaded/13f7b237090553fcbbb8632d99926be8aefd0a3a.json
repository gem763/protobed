There happened to be a boat headed there one morning \u2013 a relatively infrequent occurrence, even in summer \u2013 so I jumped at the opportunity.\n\nWhile Samos is teeming with commerce and pleasure seekers, the tranquil and bucolic Dodecanese gem (population: 35 people, 450 goats) calls to mind a mythical desert isle \u2013 a rugged landscape mantled by brush and wild olive trees stunted by the wind, hidden beaches shaded by tamarisk trees and a luminous teal sea. For me, it was an antidote to the hustle and noise of city life.\n\nYet one person\u2019s holiday paradise is another\u2019s home \u2013 with all the joys and complexities that come with it.\n\nI love my work, the animals and the land\n\nWhile searching for the secluded Limnari Beach, I met Tasos Melianos on a road leading through his family\u2019s land, before taking the steep clamber down the island\u2019s rugged eastern slope to arrive at the sheltered cove. The 45-year-old shepherd has no desire to live elsewhere, although his partner left Arkoi because she could not bear the winters. Standing in the stark afternoon light on the island summit, he explained: \u201cI love my work, the animals and the land.\u201d\n\nAs I took in the soaring panorama of a serene sea broken only by skerries surfacing like prehistoric creatures, I could understand why he stays. Days on Arkoi are marked by the melodic clanking of bells wafting down from the hills as the goatherds feed at the break of dawn and sundown. Shepherding is one of only three ways \u2013 along with fishing and tourism \u2013 residents survive economically on this tiny island of less than 7 sq km of land.\n\nWhile tourism is important to Arkoi\u2019s economy, it\u2019s limited to yachts docking for a few nights at the island\u2019s small marina in the sheltered Port Augusta, just off the public square, along with some 30 rooms available to rent. Historical sites of interest are a decaying Italian military prison built during Fascist rule under Mussolini, isolated in the arid no-man\u2019s-land of the northern half of the island, and the spectacular Votsi cave, about an hour\u2019s hike from the port, where islanders took refuge from the German bombardment in 1943.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Greece's disappearing whistled language\n\n\u2022 The Greek isle of compassion\n\n\u2022 The European city that loves strangers\n\nSeduced by my first visit, I returned to Arkoi this past October, as the last yachts of the season trickled by on their way to winter docks. I rented a room in a typical stone house overlooking the public square from Nikolas Kavouras, owner of Taverna Nikolas, one of only three restaurants on the island, along with a couple of cafes. I had arrived just in time to taste a salad of seasonal wild greens topped with the shepherd\u2019s freshly made, soft xynomizithra cheese and plump capers picked in early spring on island cliffs by Kavouras\u2019 father and preserved in saltwater by his mother, Maria, who rules the kitchen.\n\nAs we chatted one afternoon on the taverna\u2019s rambling veranda, bathed in sunlight filtered through the bamboo awning, he offered me a local\u2019s perspective of life on the island: \u201cNow it is beautiful and you have company, but when everything is closed and the wind starts blowing from the south and there are thunderstorms for one week and no boat, no doctors, no cigarettes, and the Internet and telephones go down, then we talk,\u201d said Kavouras, who now winters with his wife and kids in Poland.\n\nMany families operate businesses during the tourist season but leave the island at summer\u2019s end mostly for more populated islands like neighbouring Patmos, a boat trip of about 30 minutes, where nearly all of Arkoi\u2019s inhabitants have relatives and there are more jobs and better educational facilities.\n\nAt the moment, Arkoi\u2019s whitewashed schoolhouse has only one student: 10-year-old Christos Kamposos, the youngest of five brothers. \u201cWomen come in the summer, but they don\u2019t want to stay here to live and raise families,\u201d said schoolteacher Maria Tsialera. \u201cI cannot believe that in 2019 there is no doctor or medicines in this place.\u201d\n\nArkoi\u2019s year-round population has dwindled by nearly half since 2001, and the only permanent residents under the age of 40 are the Kamposos brothers and their 20-year-old cousin, Maria Hatz\u00ed, who plans to move to the island of Leros once she weds her fisherman fianc\u00e9.\n\nThis is like a land that belongs to another dimension\n\n\u201cThis is like a land that belongs to another dimension,\u201d said Tsialera. \u201cLife here is so beautiful and pure \u2013 it\u2019s a good place to grow up, but how do you teach these kids to deal with the world outside of the island?\u201d\n\nKamposos aspires to become a teacher but continuing his education beyond grade school means relocating to another island, something the family can hardly afford. As it stands, nobody who has been raised on Arkoi has ever completed high school.\n\n\u201cKids don\u2019t want to leave their families, so they quit school,\u201d Kavouras explained. \u201cI only finished primary school. I was always waiting for the lessons to finish for the day so I could go out in my boat and come back with 10 kilos of octopus.\u201d The class went from 12 to six pupils while he was a young student.\n\nLack of opportunity has been a common theme for residents of Greek island communities for most of the last century. As the country\u2019s economy recovered from the devastation of World War Two, once profitable activities such as mining and ceramics ceased or declined on the islands as industrial development became focused on the mainland. A large part of the country\u2019s overall population was lost in the war, and many Greeks relocated to other countries as well as urban centres. Agriculture and fishing became less viable and attractive as professions with a rise in imports from the European Union and the emergence of tourism. Yet it is only since the 1960s that tourism has become a reliable, if seasonal, source of income.\n\n\u201cThere is a serious demographic problem on the islands. We have societies that function only in summer as tourist destinations,\u201d said Anna Mavroudi, president of the Federation of Cycladic Women\u2019s Associations.\n\nHowever, change is on the horizon. Since the recent financial crisis hit the country in 2010, causing widespread unemployment in its wake, a number of young Greeks have moved from urban areas to the islands to seek alternative modes of living.\n\n\u201cLots of people have gone back to live in their grandparents\u2019 houses and are turning family-owned buildings into rentals, making honey and growing olives,\u201d Mavroudi said. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to live such a life? It\u2019s paradise.\u201d\n\nWhen the company she worked for in Athens closed down, Athina Michalopoulou, who was born in the Peloponnese region of southern Greece, decided she had nothing to lose and landed in Arkoi, eventually opening Captain Stefanis, a welcoming cafe in an old stone building just off the ferry dock.\n\nMavroudi, who has moved to Kea, her own ancestral island, argues that more people would happily live on even the most isolated islands if provided with basic necessities such as health care, waste disposal, education and frequent transportation. Connectivity and communication with the rest of the world is particularly important, and effective use of technology can make a big difference for island communities. \u201cIslands should be on the forefront of advancement in technology such as e-learning \u2013 these remote areas are where we need it most,\u201d she added.\n\nIn an effort to change things, Tsialera has arranged for English lessons via the internet and is lobbying the government to provide daily transport for kids to attend schools on Patmos, or on Lipsi, where she lives and returns to most weekends. \u201cI think we will manage to get high school classes for Christos on Arkoi,\u201d Tsialera said. \u201cThe government is obliged to send teachers even for only one student. It is very simple: language, gym, math and physics.\u201d\n\nOne night, while dining at the taverna O Trypas (The Hole), the island\u2019s raucous nocturnal hangout, I asked Christos Melianos, an affable 65-year-old fisherman who grew up on Arkoi and has returned after raising a family on Lipsi, how island life had changed over the years. \u201cWe did not have water or electricity before, but life was better,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we are taxed the same as everyone in Athens but otherwise left to fend for ourselves living on a rock.\u201d\n\nYet there are benefits to being left alone. When Kavouras was a child, there were up to six police officers stationed on Arkoi, until the government decided there wasn\u2019t enough reason to support even one. \u201cWhen the police were here, there were a lot of problems because people found reasons to complain: Why did your goat jump my fence and eat my grass? Let\u2019s go see what the police have to say,\u201d Kavouras said. \u201cSince they left in 1982, everything is OK.\u201d\n\nAccording to Angeliki Mitropoulou, a PhD candidate in island studies at the University of the Aegean, many academics and policymakers prefer to use the term islandness as an alternative to insularity, to emphasise the unique and often positive attributes of the distinct cultures of these physically isolated places.\u201cThe relationships between people living on islands do not follow the patterns of those in larger places, where there is anonymity and isolation,\u201d she said.\n\nFor many, including visitors like me, Arkoi\u2019s appeal lies precisely in its sense of remoteness and sheer lack of urgency to do much of anything. There are practically no motor vehicles on the island, with only a couple of roads to navigate. It took my dog and I at least an hour to hike the goat trails to the north side of the island for a swim in the crystalline water at the beach opposite the craggy Nisaki (literally \u201clittle island\u201d), the only evidence of civilisation was an elegant wooden sailing yacht in the distance.\n\nMost of all, on the island, there is a sense of community that is lacking in most urbanised places. Geographically cut off from the rest of the world, isolated by the sea and inclement weather, islanders have to depend on one another and the resources at hand. When I was struck down with sunstroke the day after my trek, locals banded together to find remedies and send meals up to my room. Everyone knows everyone. In fact, the populace is like one big extended family, though it doesn\u2019t hurt that everyone is likely at least a distant cousin \u2013 people are identified by nicknames since so many share the same few surnames.\n\nEveryone plays an essential role, or four. Take Lefteris \u201cKatsavidis\u201d (Screwdriver) Iliou, the island handyman, who has a fully equipped workshop with tools for every possible purpose, rents rooms, offers boat excursions and runs the electricity generator. As much as they talk about the difficulties of life here, it is apparent that the islanders have a sense of pride for the place.\n\nMy last morning on the island, as I sipped my coffee at the taverna and watched the day unfold on the public square, I noted how little had changed since my last visit a few years before. The island cats congregated around a boat just docked with fresh catch, waiting for their daily share while fisherman carefully extracted an electric ray from the bright yellow nets and a couple of yachters looked on in fascination.\n\nWhen the time came, Trypas (as Manolis Melianos, owner of the eponymous taverna, is called) threw my bag in his cargo trike and drove me to the dock to meet the ferry. The ship is the island\u2019s lifeline and its arrival is like a celebratory event, especially in winter when high seas prevent it from landing regularly. People gathered to watch as sundry supplies were carried out and the girlfriend of one of the shepherds emerged for a weekend visit from Patmos.\n\nWhether Arkoi develops to offer more opportunities for locals and sustains itself economically into the future remains to be seen. For now, though, it seems that the very isolation that has hindered its growth has saved it the fate of other, more popular Greek islands that have been spoiled by tourism. And for many islanders, the benefits of living here far outweigh the hardships.\n\nIslands of Imagination is a BBC Travel series that journeys to some of the world\u2019s most unique, extreme and beautiful places that have been inimitably fashioned by their geographic isolation.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
