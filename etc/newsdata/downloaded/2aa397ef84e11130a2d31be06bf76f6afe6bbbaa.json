So at the end of these World Championships, Britain\u2019s women will depart having contributed four medals - as well as the overwhelming majority of headlines - compared to just one from the men. When it comes to British athletics, right now it really is a woman\u2019s world.\n\nDina Asher-Smith has led the way, with her record-breaking feat of becoming the first British athlete to win three medals at a single World Championships, courtesy of gold in the 200m and silver in the 100m and 4x100m relay. Katarina Johnson-Thompson also won a spectacular heptathlon title, while the men have just a solitary 4x100m silver to show for their efforts.\n\nRather than shy away from comparisons between men and women, Britain\u2019s female sprint relay team were only too happy to embrace competition between the sexes the day after retaining their 4x100m silver.\n\nAsked how it feels to see women earning all the headlines, Asha Philip said: \u201cI feel great about that. It\u2019s all about the women and it should have been.\n\n\u201cNow\u2019s our time, so let us shine. It\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re talking about women. It\u2019s always been a negative thought \u2013 it\u2019s been about sport and then about us women. Now the boys aren\u2019t getting a look in because we\u2019re better.\u201d", "description": "In a sporting landscape where women are constantly striving for equality, athletics has a wonderful knack of flipping traditional gender hierarchies on its head.", "authors": ["Ben Bloom", "Athletics Correspondent", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212127209-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqD3d2dmOlWYuQkR76XZjLQDSn4mbJSlWY2OEDy_ToFOc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
