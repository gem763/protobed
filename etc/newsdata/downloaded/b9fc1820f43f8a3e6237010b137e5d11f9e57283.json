Ciarran and Angie also had a cute rendezvous, there was that inevitable date where people hang from a building on harnesses (seriously, why do they keep doing this every bloody season?) and a whole drama about Ryan ~dogging~ ~the~ ~BOIZ~. Hulk-smash the link below for the full recap\u2026\n\nNow let\u2019s dive straight into your tweets, which, once again, demonstrated either extremely high or worrying low libido levels \u2013 nothing in between.\n\nActually, fuck it, let\u2019s just dive into the Ciarran thirst-tweets, given that 95% of this episode\u2019s tweets were simply that. And hey, I ain\u2019t judgin\u2019 \u2013 Ciarran is repping for modern masculinity and turning it the fuck out.\n\nCIARRAN showing us all that masculinity is a prison and you can still be desirable and glamourous and flirt\u2026. He's a higher class if human. #BacheloretteAU pic.twitter.com/WelItXAN4j \u2014 \u043c\u0454\u03b1\u03b7 \u0442\u03c9\u03b9\u03b7\u043a \u03bd\u03b9\u0432\u0454\u0455 (@lil_nazza) October 23, 2019\n\nWhen @lil_nazza said \u201cmasculinity is a prison\u201d, I felt that.\n\nDoing an entire set in tribute to your own dong and everyone is into it #bacheloretteau pic.twitter.com/OBBNO9yJiM \u2014 Dame Kittness (@SoftKittyWarm) October 23, 2019\n\nTheir eventual date and smooch was so bloody cute, and it made some of us reflect on the \u2018character\u2019 journey Ciarran has gone through so far this season \u2013 a true underdog who absolutely won our hearts over.\n\nPlease raise your hands if you didn't think when this show started that you'd be rooting for Ciarren and falling in love with him Audience: #bacheloretteau pic.twitter.com/dV5jTKUpJd \u2014 Simone (@Sim_oneL) October 23, 2019\n\nIf Ciarran doesn't win this what's the point #BacheloretteAU \u2014 Jenna Guillaume (@JennaGuillaume) October 23, 2019\n\nIn stark contrast, everyone\u2019s bored of Ryan and being super savage to him online.\n\nUgh Ryan is so boring. Bring back Ciarran on screen. #BacheloretteAU \u2014 Pauee (@paueesan) October 23, 2019\n\nRyan is super impressive, he even made Angie boring! #BacheloretteAU \u2014 Kayla Joiner (@_kayjoi) October 23, 2019\n\nI mean, yes, I agree that Ryan isn\u2019t over the top like Timm or Ciarran, but, in my humble opinion, I reckon it\u2019d be too much for Ang if she paired up with someone who\u2019s equally as comedic and energetic \u2013 that\u2019d be a breeding ground for competition and toxicity. Maybe opposites do attract?\n\nAlso, if I hear the term \u201cdogging the boys\u201d come out of their mouths one more time, I\u2019ll throw a dumbbell and protein shake through my television screen.\n\nTHIS IS NOT AMERICA'S NEXT BEST FRIEND #BacheloretteAU \u2014 taryn \u0295\u0e07\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\u0e07 (@thereafter) October 23, 2019\n\nNow, back to Ciarran.\n\nBut it\u2019s been like 10 minutes since we saw Ciarran #BacheloretteAU pic.twitter.com/dGpj6RNc1n \u2014 Chelsea McLaughlin (@chelseamnz) October 23, 2019\n\nREAD MORE There Are Whispers Getting About That A Handful Of 'Bachie' Blokes Are Paid Actors\n\nMy personal highlight of the episode was Jamie being all excited about having a gift for Ang, and then literally giving her a pair of rainbow socks.
