Any breakdown in the functioning of this currency, in the management of its reserves, could create considerable financial disruption,\" Le Maire said.\n\n\"All these concerns about Libra are serious. I therefore want to say with plenty of clarity: in these conditions we cannot authorize the development of Libra on European soil.\"\n\nIn another setback this week for Libra, Switzerland said the proposed payments system could face strict rules that typically apply to banks, on top of tough anti-money laundering laws.", "description": "Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency cannot be allowed to operate in Europe while concerns persist, France's finance minister said on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d39975648c50a49f6786a22-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
