Jarvis welcomed efforts from the National Crime Agency to identify the 39 people and trace their families but said the bereaved families should be fully involved with the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe should be working with the families, not putting obstacles in their way,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should be issued with visas to come to the UK and they should have access to legal advice. We are calling for support to be put in place for families once everyone in the lorry has been identified so they can participate fully in the investigations.\u201d\n\nShe expressed concern about the response of the home secretary, Priti Patel, who said she would consider stronger penalties against smugglers.\n\nJarvis said: \u201cIt\u2019s woefully insufficient to call for greater sentences. I don\u2019t think Priti Patel\u2019s approach is realistic. We need to look at the reasons why people are moving as well as at exploitation by smugglers or traffickers. We need to look at both at the same time.\u201d\n\nJarvis advocated mechanisms to allow migrants to be able to travel without putting their lives at risk. \u201cWe need safe passage and humanitarian visas so that people will no longer need to make these terrible and dangerous journeys,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also expressed concern about information that had been publicly circulated about where the lorry may have travelled from. When Bulgaria was mentioned, many people with relatives who have passed through that country in hope of reaching the UK became frantically worried their family member had been in the lorry where the 39 Chinese nationals were discovered.\n\n\u201cInaccurate information in the public domain adds to people\u2019s trauma,\u201d she said.\n\nJarvis and others were instrumental in drawing up the landmark Mytilini Declaration document, which was signed on the island of Lesbos in May 2018. It establishes the rights of and duties towards all those who experience suffering because of the death or disappearance of their loved ones as a consequence of migrant journeys.\n\n\u201cWe are working to create a more respectful legal framework for the rights of dead migrants,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cWe need to look at things through the eyes of the bereaved.\u201d\n\nIn December 2018, the UN Compact for Safe and Orderly Migration was signed by many countries. It is a commitment to provide better treatment for migrants and includes an objective that states are required to save lives, prevent deaths and injuries to migrants, identify the missing and the dead and provide assistance to their families.\n\nDeborah Coles, director of the charity Inquest, echoed Jarvis\u2019s call for full involvement of the bereaved families in investigations into the deaths.\n\nColes said: \u201cThis is a shocking, shameful and avoidable loss of life. Both the individual deaths and the broader social and political context must be subject to the most searching scrutiny in a process which enables the bereaved families to participate.\u201d\n\nJarvis added: \u201cWe can\u2019t just say this is a crime and leave it at that. We want to ensure that we respect the dead and their families in the same way we would wish to happen for our families and loved ones.\u201d", "description": "Former%20judge%20calls%20for%20relatives%20of%20Essex%20lorry%20victims%20to%20be%20granted%20UK%20entry%20%7C%20UK%20news%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Https", "Www.Theguardian.Com Profile Dianetaylor", "Diane Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ed3e3158d5dad0a2cdb111cba99c6b16cd0d73/0_154_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed2f08f0ce475421b818d68bf5d415b1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
