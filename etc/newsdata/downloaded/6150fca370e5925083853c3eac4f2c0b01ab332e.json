The chain returned to positive like-for-like sales growth for the first time in two years in the first half, which continued into the second half. Network sales for the period were up 2.4 per cent to $2.2 billion.\n\nAPI continued to target its Sister Club loyalty program customers, which, it says, have a 34 per cent higher basket size than non-members.\n\nThe Priceline Pharmacy store network grew by a net 13 stores during the year to 488 stores. It reduced he number of company owned stores by seven during the year.\n\n\u201cWe expect that performance during the year will initially be determined by the sales through the Christmas trading period and, in the longer term, resolution of the 7th Community Pharmacy Agreement negotiations remains important,\u201d Mr Vincent said.\n\nMr Vincent said he expects the CSO structure to be maintained and to provide earnings guidance at API's January AGM.\n\nPharmacy Distribution revenue growth - excluding Hepatitis C sales and PBS reform impacts - increased 4.2 per cent to $2.9 billion.

Revenue reached $45.6 million, up 20 per cent over the year.\n\nHe said that API continued to leverage its existing infrastructure and market expertise to deliver solid profit growth for shareholders in what remains a challenging market.\n\n\u201cOur core businesses performed to expectations, with Priceline Pharmacy reporting improving like-for-like sales growth throughout the year and Pharmacy Distribution holding market share in a competitive environment,\" he said.\n\n\"We have bedded down our Clear Skincare acquisition whilst expanding the network to 52 clinics, from 44 this time last year. Our Consumer Brands business expanded further, and we continue to be excited about its prospects.\n\nMr Vincent said API continues to review its strategic holding in rival Sigma Healthcare, which knocked back its takeover overtures last March.\n\nAPI is Sigma's largest shareholder, controlling almost 13 per cent of the company.\n\nA final dividend of 4\u00a2 per share was declared and taking total dividends for the year to 7.75\u00a2, a 3.3 per cent increase on prior period.
