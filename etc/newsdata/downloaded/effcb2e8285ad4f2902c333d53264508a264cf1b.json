He resisted calling for President Trump\u2019s impeachment even when most of the other candidates did. That changed Wednesday.\n\nBiden joined the chorus of Democrats demanding President Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2013 not simply to investigate and hold impeachment inquiries. He jumped all the way to impeachment. He slowly got to this point after starting in April to call for hearings.\n\nBiden had been more cautious than his Democratic competitors to call for impeachment. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is neck-and-neck with Biden in recent polls, called for an impeachment inquiry into Trump in April after former special counsel Robert Mueller delivered his report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In late September, Biden made his call for an impeachment inquiry conditional and said if Trump did not cooperate with Congress, he would leave lawmakers with \u201cno choice\u201d but to start impeachment proceedings. Later that same day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Pelosi\u2019s call came after Trump admitted to discussing Biden and his son, Hunter, in his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and after dozens of House Democrats \u2014 many from moderate or Trump-won districts \u2014 announced their support for an inquiry.\n\nThe tone and much of the speech reminded me of Mitt Romney\u2019s diatribe against Trump in March 2016 when Mitt called him all sorts of names in a last-ditch effort to derail Trump\u2019s nomination. Biden called Trump a coward and a bully. \u201cHe\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nAnd all I hear is blah, blah, blah.\n\nWith his call for impeachment, Biden now makes himself indistinguishable from the others. The candidate who is supposed to be the comfortable old shoe who is reasoned and a safe alternative to the socialists running for the Democrat nomination now sounds like the far-left ideologues who toss due process out the window while claiming that it is Trump who is going against the Constitution.\n\nBiden did what many Trump critics do \u2013 he claims Trump is doing what \u201cno president in history\u201d has done. That\u2019s ironic because many conservatives, including myself, distinctly remember having the same thoughts during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cTrump will do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy. It\u2019s stunning, and it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Biden said. He added, \u201cNo president in history has dared to engage in such unimaginable behavior.\u201d\n\nGood old Joe was just fine with Obama and Pelosi ramming through Obamacare on a party-line vote and hijacking 1/6 of the American economy, politicizing every government agency and department you can think of, and Obama\u2019s public berating of Republicans at every opportunity. Remember when Obama said, \u201cDon\u2019t bring a knife to a gunfight\u201d? Doesn\u2019t that kind of language fall into \u201cdo anything to get re-elected\u201d territory? That was then and this is now.\n\nI keep waiting for someone to tell me specifically exactly what it is that Trump has done to require that he be impeached. Biden\u2019s jumping on the impeachment bandwagon now shows that he is worried about three things.\n\nFirst, Biden is sinking in the polls and he\u2019s no longer the frontrunner. He is now bouncing back and forth with Elizabeth Warren for the top spot in the RCP average. Yesterday she was 0.2 ahead of him and this morning as I write this, Biden is 0.2 ahead of Warren. She still leads him by 2.7 in Iowa while Biden is ahead of Warren in New Hampshire by 1.4. He delivered his impeachment speech in New Hampshire yesterday, by the way.\n\nSecond, Biden is old. He is older than Trump and Warren but younger than Bernie Sanders. Biden has his own health concerns to worry about. The latest physical sign of his frailty was the bloody eye incident during the debate. While Biden loves to boast about how macho he is by saying things like he\u2019ll beat Trump \u201clike a drum\u201d or saying how he\u2019d take a bully like Trump behind the gym and beat the hell out of him, he appears frail. He stammers when he speaks and often sounds confused.\n\nThird, the investigation into Trump\u2019s handling of the phone call with Zelensky opens up a can of worms for Biden and his family. The family\u2019s corruption is now in the spotlight. There is an interesting article at The Intercept that lays out some of Biden\u2019s problems due to his son Hunter and brother James using the family name to enrich themselves. The online publication is liberal \u2013 you just have to skip over the obvious conservative-bashing language as the author tells the story.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the Bidens\u2019 behavior isn\u2019t a legitimate problem for Democrats. Indeed, Biden has been taking political hits over of the intersection of his family\u2019s financial dealings and his own political career for some four decades. Yet he has done nothing publicly to inoculate himself from the charge that his career is corruptly enriching his family, and now that is a serious liability. By contrast, one of his opponents in the presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., went so far as to refuse to endorse his son Levi Sanders when he ran for Congress, saying that he does not believe in political dynasties. In defending the Biden\u2019s nepotistic relationship, Democrats would be forced to argue that, to be fair, such soft corruption is common among the families of senior-level politicians. But that\u2019s a risky general-election argument in a political moment when voters are no longer willing to accept business-as-usual. For now, Biden\u2019s opponents in the presidential campaign appear to all hope that somebody else will make the argument, while congressional Democrats don\u2019t want to do anything to undermine their impeachment probe. And so Biden skates.\n\nI wrote about Sanders refusing to endorse his son, Levi, back in June 2018.\n\nIt all boils down to this \u2013 Joe is nervous and his campaign isn\u2019t going well. The people around him seem to be unable to jumpstart excitement about his candidacy and Elizabeth Warren has the enthusiasm of primary voters and crowds to move her ahead. The contrast between Warren and Biden is noticeable. At age 70, she is the Energizer Bunny compared to Biden. At this point, the lead spot is hers to lose.", "description": "\"And we cannot let him get away with it.\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/894be475-4a0d-496f-9b9e-8a6d5804c00a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
