For general understanding, an \u201citem\u201d here is an object, translating into an objectified female.\n\nThese item numbers are inserted into the movie and usually have no relevance to the movie plot. But Bollywood loves it and so does the viewers. For decades, this arguably cheap tactic of drawing male gazes to theatres on the ploy of an item number with scantily clad female dancers, has been working for the Indian movie industry.\n\nAn underlying fact exists that these item numbers are sexist, reeking of sexual innuendos and misogynist in every possible way.\n\nTime and again, questions have been asked around the relevance of such item numbers, and while Bollywood apparently is more vocal about women empowerment and is making movies with female protagonists, it is still obsessed with such songs.\n\nDon't Miss 260 SHARES 118 SHARES 131 SHARES\n\nFighting the system\n\nSupporters of item songs in the industry argue that this is what the audience wants and movies are all about entertainment. After all, producers want their money back with profits and most often than not, item songs are a guarantee of success.\n\nBut it is really the case anymore?\n\nChandana Hiran, a 21-year-old woman, is leading the fight against item songs in Bollywood. Her petition on Change.org \u201cIIFA - Make a Statement Against Bollywood\u2019s Treatment of Women as Sex Objects\u201d calls to remind Bollywood that women are not sexual objects.\n\n\u201cMy campaign #WomenNotObjects is for IIFA to make a statement against objectification of women in Bollywood songs, at their upcoming awards show. I have filed an online petition (http://change.org/WomenNotObjects) which has over 56,000 signatures as of now\u201d, Chandana said.\n\nHer petition reads: \u201cAfghan Jalebi. Bomb. Bandook. Zandu Balm. Bottal. Kaddu. Halwa.\n\n\u201cThese are the words that none of us use to refer to our womenfriends, co-workers, bosses, doctors, pilots, chartered accountants, mothers and sisters in our daily lives. Then why are we sitting silently and tolerating Bollywood's continued objectification of women?\u201d\n\nChandana says that when her seven-year-old cousin belted out the song \u201cHai tujh pe right mera, tu hai delight mera, tera rasta joh roku tokne ka nahi\" (Which loosely translates as \"I have every right on you. If I block your path, don't protest\"), she knew she had to do something.\n\n\u201cSuch lyrics are completely contradictory to the notion of consent, and listening to such songs, boys and men believe that it is completely normal and acceptable for them to chase and stalk a woman and harass her. And these lyrics do not affect men alone, women also internalise the idea of submissive behaviour and accept lewd comments as normal,\u201d she says.\n\nChandana comes from a small-town patriarchal family, has grown up skinny and dark-skinned. Education and empowerment gave her a voice and a reason to stand up for herself and others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt compelled to work for gender equality, and hence picked this campaign,\u201d she added.\n\nChandana accepts that there is blatant hypocrisy in Bollywood. On one hand, celebrities have become quite vocal about women empowerment and a few even came out in support of the petition, but the industry \u201cthrives on these songs and mostly celebrities sometimes lack a correct sense of judgement\u201d about the things they must be advocating about.\n\nShe believes that it is imperative that the minds of the audience be changed. \u201cI really believe that unless the mindsets of people change, filmmakers are not going to stop making what they make. Because they obviously want to make money. It's a slow and gradual process to change mindsets of people, but I guess it needs to start somewhere,\u201d she said.\n\nChandana keeps people engaged in conversations regarding misogynistic songs and movies, patriarchy, gender stereotypes and feminism.\n\nBut the road isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nCan Bollywood survive without item songs?\n\nVeteran Actor Shabana Azmi has been quite vocal against the use of item numbers in Bollywood movies. Criticising the culture of item numbers in Hindi films, Azmi said they are used in movies for 'titillation'.\n\nDuring a panel discussion, Azmi said item numbers involve a woman surrendering to the male gaze.\n\n\"I have strong views on item numbers because they are not part of the narrative, and they've been put in a film for the only purpose of titillation and nothing else. When a girl or a leading lady says 'It's alright, I want to celebrate my sensuality', I have no problem with that. I think that's wonderful.\n\n\"But under the pretence of 'celebrating your sensuality,' what you are actually doing is surrendering to the male gaze and objectifying yourselves because the business of cinema is of images. People are shown fragmented bits of a woman\u2019s body, heaving bosom, swinging navel and shaking hip,\u201d Azmi said.\n\nThe actor even criticised Kareena Kapoor\u2019s item song in Dabangg 2, which is full of sexual insinuations.\n\n\"Please be informed, when you say 'main tandoori murgi hu, gatka lo mujhe alcohol kay saath' and a four-year-old girl is dancing on it, you are leading to the sexualisation of children and the parents who are enjoying it, people who are encouraging her are just as responsible.\"\n\nThe picture is worrying, but many in the Indian cinema industry, including leading actors, do not see a problem in this. Item numbers are seen as an establishing leap in career, even for stars like Kareena Kapoor and Katrina Kaif.\n\nAfter \u2018Chikni Chameli\u2019 in Agneepath, \u2018Shut Up And Bounce\u2019 in Dostana and \u2018Mera Naam Mary Hai\u2019 in Brothers, Karan Johar regretted his decision to include these songs in his movies as he felt that they objectified women.\n\nDuring an interview with She The People, Karan apologised for his 'mistake'. \u201cThe moment you put a woman in aa space and a thousand men looking at her lustily, it\u2019s setting a wrong example,\u201d Karan said, while vowing to never repeat this mistake.\n\nNo doubt that these songs are gratuitous, offensive and they may even be dangerous for society. The songs are promoted in a manner that women are enjoying the harassment, but in real life no woman can enjoy dancing in such a predatory environment.\n\nBollywood is now open to making movies with female protagonists, Kahaani, Piku, etc are a few examples. But it is high time that it re-evaluates the use of item numbers in movies and starts looking beyond it. Such songs have a negative impact on the society and in a country where a woman is raped every 20 minutes, the last thing we need is item numbers.", "description": "Pick any masala Bollywood movie, apart from action-packed and testosterone-boosting scenes, one thing that every such movie has in common are the \u201citem numbers\u201d.
