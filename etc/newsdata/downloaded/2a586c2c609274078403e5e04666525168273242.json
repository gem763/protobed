Ed Bott explains what makes this update different from the feature updates you\u2019ve come to dread. Read more: https://zd.net/2P1kysX\n\nRight on time, Microsoft has delivered an update for Windows 10 version 1903 that fixes the Start menu critical-error warnings that some users have experienced.\n\nMicrosoft on Thursday released KB4522355, its third update for version 1903 in October. The new update is a non-security and optional update, but it could be what addresses complaints about the Start menu not working after installing the October Patch Tuesday update.\n\nMicrosoft hasn't acknowledged the Start menu problems on its issues page for version 1903, but a Microsoft employee left a remark on a complaint about Start menu problems on its Answers forum, stating that Microsoft was aware of the issue and would release a fix in late October.\n\nSEE: 20 pro tips to make Windows 10 work the way you want (free PDF)\n\nMicrosoft's explanation of the fix for the Start menu is a little cryptic, so it remains to be seen whether this update fixes the specific issue users were reporting.\n\n\"Updates an issue that causes the Start menu, the Cortana Search bar, Tray icons, or Microsoft Edge to stop responding in certain scenarios after installing a monthly update,\" Microsoft says.\n\nGerman Microsoft-watcher Borncity explained that Start menu, Cortana, and other apps were affected by the October Patch Tuesday update because the file ActivationStore.dat is missing or damaged in four built-in shell apps, including Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost, Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost, Microsoft.Windows.Cortana, and Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin.\n\n\"This also explains why the start menu, the (Cortana) search and the Windows shell have massive issues,\" he wrote to readers on Microsoft's Answers forum.\n\nThis update addresses a whole bunch of problems that could be annoying for those affected. It should fix a bug that caused Windows 10 to display a black screen the first time users sign in after installing a feature or quality update. It fixed the same problem in version 1809 last week.\n\nThe update should also address a bug that prevented users from connecting to a VPN and another bug that froze the system at the sign-in screen.\n\nSome users also couldn't shrink a window in some circumstances, but this problem is now fixed.\n\nSEE: Why is Windows 10 a mess? Ex-Microsoft engineer blames the culture of 'made-men'\n\nThere are a bunch of fixes for Microsoft Narrator assistive technology. One bug stopped Narrator from working in certain touch-mode scenarios, while another started Narrator after signing in even when the user had configured it to start before signing in. Another bug caused Narrator to stop working in the middle of a session.\n\nAnd Microsoft claims to have fixed an issue with high CPU usage in Desktop Windows Manager when disconnecting from an RDP session.\n\nFor now, Microsoft says it isn't aware of any problems caused by this update. These stability fixes will also be included in November's Patch Tuesday, scheduled for November 12.\n\nMore on Microsoft and Windows 10 updates", "description": "Microsoft has issued an update for Windows 10 version 1903 that fixes broken Start menu after installing updates.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/c265ee80-07e1-434e-9538-281ed45eb196/thumbnail/770x578/00c168e29069f05b754c9d63f57e741a/beardeddevistock-905148408.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
