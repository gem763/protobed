They said the trade group also showed a 1.9 million barrel rise in gasoline stocks and a 2.2 million barrel fall in distillate inventories.\n\nThe figures come ahead of more closely watched figure from the Energy Information Administration Wednesday morning. Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts are looking for a decline in crude inventories of 190,000, while gasoline stocks are seen rising 300,000 barrels and distillate inventories are expected to fall by 600,000 barrels.\n\nLower run rates by refineries in the Gulf of Mexico due to Tropical Storm Imelda earlier this month are seen putting expectations for a drawdown at risk, said analysts at ING. \u201cThe market will be watching closely today to see whether the more widely followed EIA inventory numbers are similar\u201d to the API figures.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters, citing persons briefed on the operations of Saudi Aramco\u2019s operations, reported that Saudi Arabia restored production capacity to 11.3 million barrels a day, continuing a quick bounceback from the Sept. 14 attacks on facilities that were estimated to have knocked more than 5 million barrels a day out of production.\n\nReports on the rebound continue to be met with skepticism, however, given the scale of the damage seen to processing facilities. A recent Wall Street Journal report said it could take many months to fully restore operations. Noted Aramco in emergency talks with contractors, offering premium rates for parts and repair work, which could take up to a year.\n\n\u201cMarket chatter is clearly trending towards scepticism over the feasible pace of fully restoring Saudi production capacity,\u201d wrote analysts at JBC Energy, a Vienna-based consulting firm.\n\n\u201cBesides expert assessments, these opinions are probably also being fuelled by ongoing talks of unusual crude and product trade involving Saudi Aramco/Aramco Trading,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWith all that said, a look at outright prices tells us that at least for now the number of skeptics is either too low or the focus of the market is already back to the rather worrisome economic indications out there.\u201d\n\nIn other energy trading, November gasoline RBX19, -2.76% fell 2.3% to $1.5889 a gallon, while November heating oil HOX19, -2.01% was off 1.7% at $1.929 a gallon.\n\nNovember natural-gas futures NGX19, -1.90% declined 0.9% to $2.503 per million British thermalunits.", "description": "Oil futures fall as investors await official data on U.S. crude inventories after a trade group reported a rise in stocks, while reports indicate Saudi...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO009_oil_st_ZG_20190724081017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
