We\u2019re seeing new faces and hearing new voices in politics, boardrooms and on television screens.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe call for inclusion has been loud and clear, and our society is shifting to answer the call. Today, historically underrepresented people are seeing more opportunities than ever before, and workplaces have become more intergenerational and ethnically diverse than at any time in history.\n\nWhile we celebrate our progress, we still need to acknowledge that a significant workforce demographic has been overlooked, along with their productivity: 6.5 million Americans with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy and other intellectual and/or developmental differences \u2014 people who are reliable, productive and resourceful \u2014 people who can make business better.\n\nWhile we celebrate our progress, we still need to acknowledge that a significant workforce demographic has been overlooked, along with their productivity: 6.5 million Americans with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy and other intellectual and/or developmental differences \u2014 people who are reliable, productive and resourceful \u2014 people who can make business better.\n\nAccording to the Harvard Business Review, companies that employ people with autism, intellectual and/or developmental differences see positive business impacts, including better morale, improved products and services, higher productivity and ultimately increased bottom lines.\n\nSimilarly, Accenture, AAPD and Disability:In studied 45 companies that stood out in areas specific to disability employment and inclusion and found that these companies achieved, on average, 28 percent higher revenue, twice the net income and 30 percent higher economic profit margins compared with other companies in the same sample.\n\nNevertheless, unemployment of this capable population remains staggeringly high. Per data collected by National Core Indicators, approximately 81 percent of adults with developmental differences do not have a paid job.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t more companies accessing this untapped talent pool? They don\u2019t know inclusion delivers.\n\nMany business leaders and human resources departments are uncertain about how to recruit, hire and train an intellectually and developmentally diverse workforce. As has been proven with diversity and inclusion frameworks, employers need resources to match roles with people who have autism, intellectual and developmental differences.\n\nSimilarly, this diverse workforce needs support and tools to develop the skills to get hired, successfully hold jobs, find their leadership voices and create a roadmap to advancement.\n\nTo close the knowledge gap and eliminate other barriers, Autism Speaks, Best Buddies and Special Olympics are teaming up with the Entertainment Industry Foundation to launch Delivering Jobs, an inclusion campaign dedicated to creating pathways to employment and leadership opportunities for people with autism, intellectual and/or developmental differences.\n\nWith an initial investment from SunTrust Foundation, the campaign hopes to inspire companies across the country to establish more inclusive hiring practices like those of Bank of America and Microsoft, which are considered gold standard leaders in this space.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % STI SUNTRUST BANKS 68.91 +0.10 +0.15% BAC BANK OF AMERICA CORP. 31.30 +0.10 +0.32% MSFT MICROSOFT CORP. 135.94 -0.43 -0.32%\n\nPeople with autism, intellectual and/or developmental differences are already successfully fulfilling a wide variety of professional roles.\n\nKayla McKeon from New York recently became the first registered lobbyist with Down syndrome, and is now working for the National Down Syndrome Society. A visual effects and animation studio for young people with autism is a key contributor for blockbuster, Oscar-nominated films like Black Panther. A young woman from Minnesota with cerebral palsy recently graduated from law school and is currently an associate at a global law firm.\n\nMillions more talented people just like these are out there \u2013 ready and willing to work.\n\nResearch by Deloitte shows that young people entering the workforce believe inclusion of people with diverse backgrounds is directly tied to innovation and business results.\n\nNow is the time for businesses of all sizes to think differently and hire differently.\n\nAngela Geiger is president and CEO of Autism Speaks. Anthony Shriver is founder, chairman and CEO of Best Buddies. Timothy Shriver is chairman of the board at Special Olympics. Mary Davis is CEO of Special Olympics.\n\nAutism Speaks, Best Buddies and Special Olympics are here to help companies of all sizes start delivering jobs.
