I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\u201d\n\nTo raucous applause, he declared: \u201cI am back.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders\u2019 latest high-profile endorsement.\n\nSanders had emergency heart surgery this month but insists that he\u2019s more committed than ever to the 2020 race. With the first voting contests less than four months away, he has some work to do.\n\nBeyond health concerns, Sanders suddenly finds himself looking up at progressive rival Elizabeth Warren and establishment favorite Joe Biden in the polls. Now he must reassure voters that he has the physical stamina to go forward while addressing broader concerns that his policies may be too far left to defeat Trump in a general election.\n\nThe endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, the 30-year-old high-profile progressive, \u201csends the message that the movement is growing, that it\u2019s gaining influence, that it\u2019s gaining traction,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign manager Faiz Shakir said.\n\nWhile Sanders pledged during this week\u2019s presidential debate to move forward with a \u201cvigorous\u201d campaign, he\u2019s moving cautiously in the short term. The rally in Queens was his only scheduled appearance before he returns to Iowa late next week.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders resumed campaigning weeks after being sidelined by a heart attack.", "authors": ["Steve Peoples"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1176884513.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
