In addition, Copa del Rey matches are scheduled for Dec. 18, and the Club World Cup will already be underway in Qatar.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Barcelona's rescheduled \"cl\u00e1sico\" match against Real Madrid looks set to go ahead on Dec. 18.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
