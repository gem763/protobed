Kay Ivey's office has also offered a separate $5,000 reward to help bring home 3-year-old Kamille \"Cupcake\" McKinney.\n\nKamille was playing with other children at an outdoor birthday party in Birmingham on Saturday night when she vanished, authorities said. An Amber Alert was issued but the Birmingham police said earlier this week that there was no information on Kamille's whereabouts.\n\nAlabama Law Enforcement Agency\n\nBirmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith spoke directly to the kidnapper at a Wednesday news conference.\n\n\"If you have her and you're not sure what to do \u2026 please bring her to one of our fire stations, police station, a hospital,\" Smith said. \"If you don\u2019t know what to do or where to go and you\u2019re frightened, we\u2019re here to help you ... please bring her to a safe location.\"\n\nDays into the investigation, Jasmaine Deloach, the head of a local missing persons group, is refusing to stop looking -- because she said she's been in Kamille's family's shoes.\n\nPlease keep sharing her picture. 3-year-old Kamille McKinney is still missing.

She said her daughter was later found states away. No one was arrested in her daughter's case, which is still under investigation.\n\nNow Deloach works to help law enforcement and comfort families of missing persons.\n\nDeloach said she learned from her daughter's case that often when kidnappers see the law enforcement and media presence intensifying, \"they panic.\"\n\nThat's why at a Monday night vigil for Kamille, Deloach said she also appealed directly to the unknown person or people who took the little girl, pleading, \"She might not even remember who you are, so if you have any heart, please let her go.\"\n\nKamille McKinney, age 3, was last seen around 8:30 p.m. on Oct 12, 2019, in the Tom Brown Village Housing Community of Birmingham, AL. She wore a pink t-shirt, leopard print shorts, no shoes, and yellow, white, & blue hair bows.
