REUTERS/Mike Blake (UNITED STATES - Tags: ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS TELECOMS) More\n\nAT&T has been under pressure in recent weeks from activist investor Elliott Management. Earlier this month, Elliott Management disclosed a multi-billion dollar stake in AT&T and publicly issued a lengthy list of criticisms and suggestions for AT&T, including this push for asset sales:\n\n\u201cAny assets that do not have a clear, strategic rationale for being part of AT&T should be considered for divestment: DirecTV, the Mexican wireless operations, pieces of the wireline footprint, and other assets must all be evaluated as part of this review,\u201d Elliott Management said in a press release.\n\nPlus, should the aforementioned T-Mobile-Sprint deal proceed (it was greenlighted by the Department of Justice but now faces potential roadblocks from state attorneys general), one condition of the deal is for Dish to build out a wireless network.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say a DirecTV-Dish was approved \u2014 Dish is going to be biting more than they can chew if they build their wireless network and integrate DirecTV at the same time,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nAT&T\u2019s diversification strategy\n\nMeanwhile, a sale of DirecTV would be a blow to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson\u2019s strategy of diversifying the company's business, Snyder said.\n\n\u201cRandall really wants DirecTV in business \u2014 it\u2019s the cornerstone of his diversification efforts,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cThere\u2019s a good argument to be made that there\u2019s some cross pollination between wireless, DirecTV and WarnerMedia -- how much is very much up for debate.\u201d\n\nIn a July 2015 press release announcing the completion of the DirecTV deal, Stephenson praised the transaction: \u201cWe\u2019re now a fundamentally different company with a diversified set of capabilities and businesses that set us apart from the competition.\u201d\n\nFor Snyder, who has a buy rating on AT&T, he hopes a deal proceeds at a reasonable price.\n\n\u201cEven if they get half the value [of DirecTV back], that\u2019s roughly $24 billion - that\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d he said, adding that he thinks AT&T has no chance of selling DirecTV for the same or more than they paid for the company in 2015.\n\nAMS More\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
