The race made history as Abrams became the first black woman to be a gubernatorial nominee for a major political party. Though she ultimately lost the election, her charisma and relatability won over the support of many. From the controversial loss, however, sprung Abrams' intensified advocacy for voters' right and the end of voter suppression across the country.\n\nREAD MORE: Senator Elizabeth Warren's net worth revealed as the 2020 Presidential Election heats up\n\nOfficially, Abrams has yet to concede, but she has recognized Kemp as the legal victor of the race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying they stole it from me,\u201d Abrams said at a National Action Network convention in New York City. \u201cThey stole it from the voters of Georgia.\u201d\n\nDespite Abrams' high-profile status, she still makes time to spread words of encouragement to others who may not have thought a viable career in politics or any underrepresented industry is possible. \"My job is to be a voice for others,\" Abrams explained.\n\nAbrams recently attended Bustle's second annual Rule Breakers event in New York where they celebrated the politician for breaking barriers in politics.
