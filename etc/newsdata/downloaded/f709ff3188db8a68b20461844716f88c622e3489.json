Lung experts say oils like vitamin E may be partially to blame.", "language": "en", "text": "Vape juice has been tied to a mysterious crop of hundreds of lung illnesses across the US.\n\nMultiple people have been hospitalized, and some have gone into medically-induced comas.\n\nAt least eight people across the US have died after vaping.\n\nLung and e-cigarette experts say that part of the problem may be that oil from vape juices, including vitamin E, is getting into people's lungs.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThere's something dangerous going on in the lungs of hundreds of vapers, and their vape juice might be to blame.\n\nAt least 530 cases of serious vaping-related lung issues have been reported to the CDC in recent months across 38 US states, plus the US Virgin Islands.\n\nSo far, the lung problems have led to several medically-induced comas and eight deaths. The eighth was reported Thursday afternoon in Missouri, where health officials said a man in his \"mid-40s\" died after vaping.\n\n\"This is an unfortunate case of a young man with no prior lung illness who started vaping because of chronic pain issues,\" Dr. Michael Plisco, a pulmonologist at Mercy Hospital in St. Louis (where the patient was being treated), said in a statement. \"He started out with shortness of breath and it rapidly progressed and deteriorated, developing into what is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Once the lungs are injured by vaping, we don't know how quickly it worsens and if it depends on other risk factors.\"\n\nOthers fatalities have been logged in California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas, Illinois, and Indiana.\n\n\"We don't yet know the exact cause of these illnesses \u2014 whether they're caused by contaminants, ingredients in the liquid or something else, such as the device itself,\" Dr. Ann Thomas, a public health physician with the Oregon Health Authority, said earlier this month in a release announcing that state's first vaping-related death.\n\nRead More: A 20-year-old man who used to vape every day almost died from a life-threatening lung injury, and 'vape juice' might be the culprit\n\nNo specific vaping brands have been called out, but many of the illnesses have involved cannabinoid liquids like THC.\n\nThe FDA is opening a criminal probe into the vaping supply chain\n\nOn Thursday, the FDA announced that its Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) is opening a criminal probe into the supply chain for vaping products, looking for any rogue actors who might've introduced harmful substances into vaping products, and especially those that people might buy off the street with THC or other cannabinoids in them.\n\n\"Let me be clear, OCI is not pursuing any prosecutions associated with personal use of any controlled substances in these cases,\" Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said on a call with reporters. He said even though not all of the vaping illnesses have been in people who used THC, many were.\n\nExperts aren't sure yet exactly why some people are getting sick and dying after vaping, but they have a hunch that the illnesses may be nothing new. Because the vaping industry is largely unregulated, there are hundreds of different chemicals in vape liquids on the market, making it impossible for people to know whether the ones they're using are safe.\n\n\"We haven't been able to analyze e-liquid from these people, so we don't know what's in them,\" Professor Robert Tarran, who studies vaping at the University of North Carolina Marisco Lung Institute, told Insider.\n\nTarran says despite all the variation in what vapers inhale, there are two common ingredients in e-cigarettes: nicotine (dosed in varying concentrations), and propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin (PG-VG).\n\n\"That kind of narrows it down,\" he said.\n\nNicotine isn't always in cannabis-derived e-liquids, suggesting that the vegetable oils and other liquid solvents (PG-VG) \u2014 which are used to deliver drugs in all kinds of vape pens, whether there is nicotine inside them or not \u2014 could be playing a major role in the lung illnesses.\n\nVitamin E oil, used to deliver drugs, could also be making vapers sick\n\nThe flavors of vaping liquids are one of the top two reasons young people told Reuters they begin using e-cigs. REUTERS/David Becker\n\nFederal and state health officials are worried about the presence of one of these liquid solvents, vitamin E acetate, in many sick patients' vapes.\n\nFDA commissioner Ned Sharpless said in tweet on September 6 that \"we are leaving no stone unturned in following any potential leads, including vitamin E acetate found in many of the samples containing THC.\"\n\nVitamin E acetate (which is in oils including canola, soy, and corn) vaporizes at 363 degrees Fahrenheit, well above temperatures at which some people vape.\n\nIt could be the case that this vitamin oil, which is meant to harmlessly deliver drugs, is ending up in people's lungs as an invasive liquid. Then, the body mounts an immune response, prompting pneumonia. This idea aligns with what Tarran has found over roughly five years of his own research.\n\n\"I think there's an emerging consensus that the immune cells of the lung are a little bit upset by vaping,\" he said.\n\nA small study of 31 healthy adults released by the University of Pennsylvania last month suggested, similarly, that some of the \"harmless\" oils like propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (PG-VG) inside vape pens might undergo dangerous transformations as they heat up and aerosolize inside vape pens, potentially turning them into toxic substances.\n\nCases of vapers suffering from pneumonia stretch as far back as 2012\n\nProfessor Thomas Eissenberg at the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for the Study of Tobacco Products agrees that vegetable oils found in many vape juices could be the major cause for concern. He points to at least seven different case studies published over the past decade, which all suggest that vape oil could be hurting people's lungs.\n\nOne is a 2018 BMJ case report of a 34-year-old British woman who'd been vaping for three years when she developed lipoid pneumonia and respiratory failure, while another from 2012 details how a 42 year old woman was seen multiple times and prescribed \"several courses of antibiotics\" before doctors finally told her to stop using e-cigarettes. (Only then did her symptoms improve.)\n\nRead More: Trump wants to ban flavored vapes, but that might just worsen the vaping lung injury crisis\n\n\"Vegetable glycerin is derived from vegetable oil, and to the extent that the derivation process is not complete, vegetable oil could be getting into the liquid,\" Eissenberg told Insider. \"If that's the case, we may be seeing not the last cluster of lipoid pneumonia, but rather the first.\"\n\nIf oil gets into people's lungs, where the body only expects to encounter air and oxygen, it can prompt inflammation, mounting a defensive immune response that leads to pneumonia.\n\n\"It makes me wonder whether, if we pulled a hundred electronic cigarette users off the streets and got some of their lung fluid, how many of them would have lipids in their macrophages?\" Eissenberg said. \"They're not experiencing symptoms, but they have the underlying cause.\"\n\nTarran also worries the oily lung problems may be larger than the hundreds of confirmed and probable cases that have been reported to the CDC and FDA by medical professionals. But he cautions that there could be other reasons for the pneumonia cases, including \"rogue chemicals\" or nicotine in vapes.\n\nCotton candy flavored e-liquid on display during Vape Jam UK 2019 on April 12, 2019 in London.
