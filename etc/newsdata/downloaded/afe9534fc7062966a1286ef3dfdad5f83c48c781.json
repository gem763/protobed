REUTERS/Bryan Woolston/File Photo\n\nTrump went to Fayetteville, a city in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, on Monday to rally Republican supporters in a repeat election of a 2018 contest that was tainted by fraud. Both Republicans and Democrats expect Tuesday\u2019s election to be close and to provide clues about what might happen in presidential and congressional elections next year.\n\nRepublican Dan Bishop, a 55-year-old state senator who has embraced Trump\u2019s policies and some of his political tactics, is facing 36-year-old Democrat Dan McCready, a small-businessman and U.S. Marine Corps veteran, in Tuesday\u2019s race.\n\nBishop\u2019s campaign ads have said McCready \u201cadmires socialism\u201d and linked him to the \u201cSquad,\u201d a group of progressive House Democrats that Trump has repeatedly attacked.\n\nTrump picked up on the theme, one of his favorites against Democrats running in 2020.\n\n\u201cTo stop the far left, you must vote in tomorrow\u2019s special election,\u201d Trump told the cheering crowd. \u201cTomorrow is your chance to send a message to the America-hating left.\u201d\n\nBishop\u2019s campaign says the most important issues are taxes, the economy and immigration, while McCready has focused his race on healthcare, education and the pay of North Carolina teachers.\n\n\u201cI share your values. I\u2019m not ashamed of your values. I\u2019m going to defend your values in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Bishop said at the rally, calling Trump a \u201cgreat fighter\u201d against \u201csocialist\u201d Democrats.\n\nMcCready met with fellow veterans in Fayetteville hours before Trump\u2019s speech and talked about how Americans were getting \u201ccrushed\u201d by healthcare costs. He sent out a fundraising email after the Republican rally, headlined: \u201cTrump just attacked me on stage.\u201d\n\nOpinion polling indicates a tight race, with turnout an important factor. The result will not affect the balance of power in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence also campaigned for Bishop, and addressed the evening rally before Trump.\n\nTrump said he believed Bishop had a good chance of winning and that the contest had become \u201cless close\u201d since his own involvement began about two weeks ago. Trump stressed, however, that \u201cI\u2019m not running.\u201d\n\nTrump has called North Carolina\u2019s Republican Party chairman several times for updates on the campaign, a Republican involved in the special election said.\n\nThe sprawling 9th District, a combination of suburban and rural areas stretching south and east of the city of Charlotte, has been represented by Republicans for decades, and voted for Trump by about 12 percentage points in 2016. A Republican loss would be a worrisome sign for the president and his party.\n\nBut Democrats are daring to hope for an upset that would build on their takeover of the House from Republicans in elections last year and make further inroads in \u201cTrump country.\u201d\n\nMORE COMPETITIVE\n\nThe national press secretary for Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, Kayleigh McEnany, dismissed the idea that the 9th District election was predictive of the 2020 campaign.\n\n\u201cThe president is not on the ballot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big difference when he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t see it as a bellwether,\u201d Trump told reporters before he left the White House.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Pence attended a \u201cGet out the Vote\u201d event with Bishop in the town of Wingate. He urged voters to turn out in Union County, a suburban Charlotte county that some analysts say could be a key battleground in the race.\n\nThe district was already getting more competitive in 2018 when McCready lost narrowly before state officials ruled the election was marred by an absentee-ballot fraud scheme that benefited McCready\u2019s then-opponent, Republican Mark Harris. A new election was ordered, and Harris declined to run again.\n\nTrump exhorted supporters to set the tone for next year with a victory in North Carolina.\n\n\u201cA vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we take the first steps to firing (House of Representatives) Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump is going all-out to try to keep a North Carolina district in the Republican column in a special congressional election on Tuesday that may serve as a bellwether for his own fortunes in 2020.", "authors": ["Roberta Rampton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428144472&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8815J", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
