It has already been proven that the things they accused in the lawsuit never occurred.\u201d\n\nThe Riches said in a statement that they looked forward to seeking justice, including at a possible trial.\n\n\u201cWe would not wish what we have experienced upon any other parent,\u201d they added.\n\nThe couple, from Omaha, Nebraska, had said the campaign against them included their hiring, at Butowsky\u2019s suggestion, a private detective to investigate their son\u2019s death.\n\nZimmerman later cited the detective\u2019s findings in a discussion of Seth Rich\u2019s alleged contacts with WikiLeaks.\n\nCalabresi said the reporter then lent credibility to those findings by emphasizing the detective\u2019s connection to the Riches.\n\n\u201cWe have no trouble concluding that - taking their allegations as true - the Riches plausibly alleged what amounted to a campaign of emotional torture,\u201d Calabresi wrote.\n\nThe Riches claimed to suffer symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder, and Mary Rich said she no longer feels comfortable in public.\n\nFriday\u2019s decision also lets the Riches sue for alleged interference with their contract with the detective, and try to revive a negligent supervision claim against Fox News.\n\nThe case is Rich et al v Fox News Network LLC et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-2321.", "description": "A federal appeals court on Friday revived a lawsuit against Fox News Network over its reporting on Seth Rich, a former Democratic National Committee employee whose unsolved murder sparked uncorroborated right-wing conspiracy theories.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
