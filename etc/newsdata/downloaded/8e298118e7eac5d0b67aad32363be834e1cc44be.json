But it turns out there was a rather large downfall to the dress: she couldn't go to the bathroom.\n\nThe corset Kardashian wore under her dress to narrow her waist was so tiny she couldn\u2019t even sit down\u2014let alone use the toilet\u2014so she had a contingency plan in place in case she needed to, um, relieve herself during fashion's most glamorous night.\n\nIn a clip from an upcoming episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, we find out just how concerned she was about the situation.\n\n\u201cIf I have to pee, it\u2019s a problem,\" Kardashian tells her crew.\n\nHer friend, Natalie Halrco, suggests she could wear a diaper, but the SKIMS creator wasn't into that idea.\n\n\"Honestly, if it\u2019s an emergency, I think I pee my pants and then have my sister wipe my leg up,\u201d Kardashian says. \u201cI\u2019m not even joking. She can wipe my leg up.\"\n\nShe's, of course, referring to her younger sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, who also both attended this year's Met Gala, where the theme was \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"\n\nView photos The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion - Social Ready Kevin Mazur/Getty Images More\n\nIt's unclear if Kardashian actually peed her pants or whether either of her sisters had to wipe it up, but using the toilet wasn\u2019t the only challenge she faced.\n\nAside from needing to take corset breathing lessons to successfully pull off the look, the dress' intricate water droplet beading was also very painful for her to wear throughout the night.\n\n\"I have never felt pain like that in my life,\" Kardashian revealed.\n\n\u201cNot only is this silicone [and] 500 hours of beading and making, but every little piece is itchy on the inside. It\u2019s pokey. So it pokes me,\u201d she said. If it wasn't evident before, it's clear now that the reality star's love for fashion truly has no limits.\n\nView photos The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion - Arrivals Dia Dipasupil/FilmMagic More\n\nView photos The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion - Arrivals Neilson Barnard/Getty Images More\n\nYou can watch the clip below.\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on E!.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Glamour\n\n", "description": "The reality star's love for fashion has no limits.", "authors": ["Natasha Reda"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nApt4HAwPOpsfQ3AS52OlA--~B/aD02MDAwO3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/e8f07b11791169ba39e573837f4eaa76", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
