You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHe cited Ministry of Justice figures which suggested that as many as 32,000 crimes a year could be avoided by handing out effective non-custodial sentences rather than short spells in jail for less serious offences.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the figures, one in three people who are given custodial sentences are sentenced to less than three months in prison and half to less than six months,\u201d said Mr Burgon.\n\n\u201cIn the female estate it\u2019s even worse than that, with half of women receiving three month or less and two-thirds six months or less. And almost half of these women on short sentences are in jail for shoplifting.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that prison is the best place for them. People whose lives are often already chaotic have them further disrupted by these super-short prison sentences. They lose their homes and their jobs, relationships break down and communication between women and their children is undermined.\n\n\u201cAll of these things make it more likely that they will reoffend. That\u2019s what the Ministry of Justice\u2019s own evidence shows.\u201d\n\nIn place of a short stay behind bars, offenders whose crimes do not involve violence or sexual misconduct could be ordered to work on projects selected by local communities or be required to undertake programmes to tackle their alcohol or drug dependency or treatment for mental health problems. Labour is already drawing up plans to invest in problem-solving courts to tackle addiction and other problems lying behind crime.\n\nMr Burgon dismissed the idea that sentences in the community would offer an \u201ceasy ride\u201d to offenders.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

That\u2019s up 80 per cent over four years.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re sending homeless people to prison and people engaged in shoplifting to prison, you\u2019ve got to ask yourself the question: should the government\u2019s response be to build more and more prisons for these people?\n\n\u201cPrison is often the worst place for people with mental health problems, alcohol and drug addictions. It\u2019s only by turning these problems around that you turn lives around and reduce reoffending.\u201d\n\nMr Burgon declined to say what reduction he expected the policy to deliver to the 83,000 prison population in England and Wales.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t being done for the purpose of getting the prison population down to some arbitrary figure,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about trying to look at what works and what reduces the number of victims of crime.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that chest-beating about reannouncing another 10,000 prison places is going to help communities that are victims of crime. Those 10,000 prison places have been announced by five justice secretaries and three prime ministers anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the government isn\u2019t looking at the evidence its own ministry has uncovered. It seems they are chasing headlines in the right-wing press rather than looking at what works for victims of crime.\u201d", "description": "Thousands of offenders could avoid jail under new Labour plans to halt the use of most short prison sentences.
