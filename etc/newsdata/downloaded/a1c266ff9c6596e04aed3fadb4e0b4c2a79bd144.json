I am just going to be me.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe video sparked ridicule in some media, including \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d where Piers Morgan agreed with actress Joan Collins that the world had \u201cgone nuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can there be 100, it\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d Ms. Collins said.\n\nThe Royal College of General Practitioners, which represents general practitioners in the U.K., recognizes only six gender identities: Male, female, gender-neutral, non-binary, gender-fluid and gender-queer, The Sun reported.\n\nA BBC spokeswoman defended the video in a statement to The Sun.\n\n\u201cThe Big Talk series was contributed to by more than 50 independent experts and professionals and is intended to be used by teachers, within the safe space of the classroom, to prompt further conversation with their pupils on the topics raised,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
