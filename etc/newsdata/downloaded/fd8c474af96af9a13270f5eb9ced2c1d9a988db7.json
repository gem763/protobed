'You know, he's very good at pretending things.\n\n'He can't even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he's always wearing a mask.\n\nScheer continued: 'He puts on a reconciliation mask and then fires the attorney general, the first one of indigenous background.\n\n'He puts on a feminist mask and then fires two strong female MPs for not going along with his corruption.\n\n'He puts on a middle class mask and then raises taxes on middle class Canadians.'\n\nScheer concluded his tirade against his opponent by saying: 'Mr Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud, and you do not deserve to govern this country.'\n\nScheer (left) attacked Trudeau (right), saying: 'He puts on a reconciliation mask and then fires the attorney general, the first one of indigenous background. He puts on a feminist mask and then fires two strong female MPs for not going along with his corruption. He puts on a middle class mask and then raises taxes on middle class Canadians'\n\nScheer concluded his tirade against his opponent by saying: 'Mr Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud, and you do not deserve to govern this country'\n\nGreen party leader Elizabeth May, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, Conservativ eleader Andrew Scheer, People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier, Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh participating in Federal Leaders Debate on Monday\n\nTrudeau's popularity suffered last month after a 2001 photograph of him emerged in brown face at an Arabian Nights party when he was a teacher.\n\nA day later, a photograph of the Day-O performance came out and since then, a video of a third incident where he was wearing blackface emerged. Support for the Canadian prime minister plummeted in the wake of a blackface scandal, according to a Nanos research poll.\n\nAnother issue that Scheer used against Trudeau was the SNC-Lavalin affair. Earlier this year, Trudeau faced controversy after a federal ethics commissioner found that he had improperly influenced then Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in an ongoing criminal case against Quebec-based construction company SNC-Lavalin.\n\nTrudeau defended his position, insisting he had acted to try to save SNC-Lavalin jobs. 'The role of the prime minister is to stand up for Canadian jobs, to stand up for the public interest and that's what I've done,' he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister shot back at Scheer during the debate, criticizing him for weak climate proposals, while defending his own record over the past four years in office - including a strong economy, less poverty and low unemployment.\n\nHe also accused Scheer and his Tories of fostering 'politics of fear and division.'\n\nFederal party leaders, Green Party leader Elizabeth May, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, People's Party of Canada leader Maxine Bernier, Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pose for photo ahead of leadership debate\n\nThe leaders of Canada's six parties pose together for photo ahead of leadership debate\n\nBloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, People's Party of Canada leader Maxine Berlier and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer listen to Trudeay during the Leaders Debate\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh jumped into the fray, opining: 'What we have here is Mr. Scheer and Mr. Trudeau arguing which is worst for Canada.'\n\nOn climate, he said: 'You don't need to choose between Mr. Delay (Trudeau) and Mr. Deny (Scheer).'\n\nThe debate featured Green Leader Elizabeth May, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet and People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier.\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh (left) said People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier (right) did not deserve to be in the debate because of what he described as repugnant views on immigration and his Twitter attack on 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom Bernier called 'mentally unstable\n\nBernier (left) responds to Singh (right) during the Federal Leaders Debate in Quebec on Monday\n\nSingh - an observant Sikh and the first visible minority leader of a federal political party - said Bernier did not deserve to be in the debate because of what he described as repugnant views on immigration and his Twitter attack on 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom Bernier called 'mentally unstable.'\n\n'Your ideas are hurtful to Canada,' Singh said, accusing Bernier of 'inciting hatred.'\n\n'After a couple of minutes of this debate tonight, I think people can clearly see why you didn't deserve a platform (to air your views),' he said.\n\nMonday's debate was the only one in English for the three-quarters of Canadians who speak it. The final leadership debate ahead of the October 21 election will take place on Thursday, in French.\n\nThe latest national numbers from Nanos Research shows the Liberals at 34 per cent and the Conservatives at 33 per cent.", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was labelled as a 'phony' who is 'always wearing a mask' by Conservative rival Andrew Scheer during Monday's heated leadership debate in Quebec.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/19435720-0-image-a-55_1570528542221.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
