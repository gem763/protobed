Anyone is welcome to take home as many books as they want from the used book \u201cstore.\u201d Some tuck a novel or two into their totes and head out. Others fill cardboard boxes to the brim.\n\nThe organization anticipates people\u2019s incredulousness at the idea. The first three questions on its FAQ Web page read: Are the books free? Yes! Really Free? Yup. Absolutely Free? Yes.\n\nIt\u2019s a uniquely important resource for city teachers, whose struggle to pay for the books they needed to fill their classrooms inspired the Book Thing\u2019s creation two decades ago.\n\nDan Parsons, an English teacher at Frederick Douglass High, walked out of the Book Thing on Saturday with a loaded box in his hands and even more books stuffed into his canvas backpack.\n\nAt his West Baltimore school \u2014 where many students come from poverty and witness the city\u2019s unrelenting gun violence up close \u2014 Parsons transformed his classroom into a literary oasis. Hundreds of books cover nearly every surface. He uses stocked bookshelves to cordon off reading nooks where students can escape into the kinds of stories that both reflect their own experiences and open their minds to new ones.\n\nParsons is often asked what\u2019s the best support for educators in the city. The longtime teacher\u2019s answer? \u201cI say the Book Thing.\u201d\n\nSome of that is for practical reasons. Thanks to the copy he grabbed Saturday, Parsons has accumulated a dozen editions of \u201cThe Art of the Personal Essay\u201d for his students to use. He\u2019s stocked up on \u201cKing Lear\u201d so neither his school nor his students have to spend money on more copies of the Shakespearean tragedy. He collects what would be pricey SAT and ACT prep books so he can help his students prepare for college readiness exams.\n\nThe Book Thing draws teachers from across the state. They spread the word among themselves about this seemingly magical source of books in Baltimore. There\u2019s a deep need for it, they say. According to a survey released last year by the National Center for Education Statistics, 94 percent of teachers use their own money for classroom supplies. On average, the survey found, a teacher will spend about $480.\n\nThe desire to give teachers an assist is woven into the Book Thing\u2019s DNA. Its founder, Russell Wattenberg, got the idea for it when he was working in a downtown bar in the late 1990s. He often overheard the public school teachers who came in for happy hour complaining about their need for more books.\n\nThere\u2019s no real inventory at the Book Thing \u2014 just volunteers in a backroom with no air conditioning sorting grocery carts full of books into general categories.\n\nThe warehouse as it exists today rose from the ashes of a devastating fire in 2016. People from all over the city rallied around the Book Thing and helped it reopen the next year.\n\nExecutive Director Bonnie Hoppa can\u2019t promise teachers she\u2019ll have the exact text they need, but she knows the Book Thing will always have something of value for them.\n\nAmanda Smoot used to teach eighth grade, but this year she\u2019s moving down to sixth and seventh at Anne Arundel\u2019s Old Mill Middle School South.\n\nShe spent Saturday morning in the bustling \u201cKids\u201d section, the only corner in the concrete-floored warehouse outfitted with a colorful carpet.\n\nShe thumbed through a used copy of \u201cMatilda,\u201d the Roald Dahl story about an extraordinary girl from an abusive family who often escapes into the magical world of books.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Smoot said, \u201cI definitely want this one.\u201d", "description": "For years people have dropped off unwanted books at the Book Thing and then gone inside to browse through others\u2019 donated stories.", "authors": ["Talia Richman", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png"}
