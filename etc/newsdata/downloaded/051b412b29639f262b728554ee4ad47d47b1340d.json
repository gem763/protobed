And the developers declined to say how much the penthouses would cost, saying they were not yet being marketed for sale.\n\nThe architects Herzog and de Meuron were behind the Beijing National Stadium in China, which is also known by its nickname the Bird's Nest\n\nThe architects Herzog and de Meuron were also behind London's iconic Tate Modern\n\nAs for typical buyers, the developers say they have had a variety - from professional tennis players, to those looking for a city base during the working week.\n\nWhile families have bought the flats, they tend to have older children - at least in their teens - as the developer says British attitudes towards tower living arethat it isn't conducive to pets and younger children.\n\nHowever, it says families with younger children are still welcome as buyers, with the development of the surrounding area including a primary school and a doctor's surgery.\n\nFacilities at One Park Drive include a leisure suite with an indoor swimming pool and a gym\n\nThese facilities and the development sit on a new residential district of Canary Wharf called Wood Wharf, which lies to the east of the current Canary Wharf estate and is reached via Water Street Bridge.\n\nThe luxury interiors by Goddard Littlefair include raw concrete walls, while those interiors by Bowler James Brindley include circular glass showers with frosted glass walls - made by the same manufacturer that makes BMW car windscreens.\n\nIn the new tower, the first two floors include residents' facilities such as a spa, swimming pool and a gym.\n\nThe leasehold flats come with a lease of 250 years and ground rents of between \u00a3550 a year for the one-bed flats and \u00a31,000 for a three-bed flat, with ground rents increasing every 25 years.\n\nThe service charge is \u00a37.33 per square foot, which equates to \u00a315,099 a year on a three-bedroom flat.", "description": "The 58-storey tower has been designed by Herzog and de Meuron, the architects behind the Tate Modern in London and the Beijing National Stadium - also known as the Bird's Nest, in China.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/08/11/4853574-0-image-a-80_1538994402783.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-09"}
