It also asked the European Commission to shine a light on \"the question of foreign funding of European political parties and foundations\" by external actors.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But other MEPs criticised the party's vote and said disinformation was being \"weaponised by hostile foreign actors\".\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the Skripal attack, Russia reportedly published 138 contradictory accounts of the nerve agent attack, with disinformation reaching UK citizens through social media accounts,\" said Antony Hook, a Liberal Democrat member of the European Parliament\u2019s Civil Liberties Committee.\n\n\"I am shocked and appalled that MEPs from the Brexit Party today refused to support measures to better tackle fake news and disinformation, which is weaponised by hostile foreign actors.\"\n\nIn June the Brexit party was asked to check \u00a32.5m it has received in donations to ensure the money had come from legitimate sources. The UK Electoral Commission warned that the structure of the party \u201cleaves it open to a high and ongoing risk of receiving and accepting impermissible donations\u201d.\n\nIn June EU officials said Russia had tried to disrupt May's European Parliament elections by spreading disinformation and using fake stories to \"promote extreme views\". Russia's government denies that it acts in this way.\n\nEU member states have seen a series of allegations of parties - most from the far-right of the political spectrum - being funded by Russian sources. In July Italy's then deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini was forced to deny that his far-right League party had sought millions from Russian investors in a secret oil deal. In Austria the leader of the far-right Freedom Party resigned after a sting operation showed him promising government contracts to a purported Russian oligarch in exchange for positive media coverage.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
