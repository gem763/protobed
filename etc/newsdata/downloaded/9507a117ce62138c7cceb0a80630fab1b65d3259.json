After a single tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV refused to air the two games, and nearly all of NBA China\u2019s local sponsors have fled.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nThe angry backlash in the Middle Kingdom has illustrated anew the difficult challenge Western companies face as they do business in a country whose massive\n\nmarket they crave but whose government espouses values they don\u2019t. In the past week, U.S. firms from Google to Nike to gaming company Activision Blizzard have been caught up in controversy over their dealings with China. So, too, has Hollywood, with \u201cSouth Park\u201d putting out an episode deeply critical of the Beijing regime and the U.S. \u2014 and getting scrubbed from the internet in China as a result.\n\nDue to its new status as a global economic and political powerhouse, China is likely to grow even more assertive in its response to anything it deems counter to its interests, some analysts say.\n\n\u201cI fear that this is the new normal,\u201d says James McGregor, Greater China chairman of public relations firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cInstead of sitting back and accepting criticism, China is now on the offensive to influence, and in some cases control, the global discussion about China and its way of doing things.\u201d\n\nThe situation is particularly delicate at the moment because of the ongoing civic protests in Hong Kong, which began in June and have since morphed into a broader pro-democracy, anti-Beijing movement. The mainland\u2019s ruling Communist Party has portrayed the protests as a counterrevolutionary separatist movement spurred on by \u201cforeign forces\u201d including the U.S., with which China is engaged in a grinding trade war.\n\nThe country has also just come off its huge 70th anniversary celebrations of the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic, a highly politically sensitive occasion accompanied by heightened censorship.\n\n\u201cAt such a moment, an influential foreigner or a noteworthy company making statements that touch on Chinese sovereignty is like taking a match to the powder keg,\u201d says Florian Schneider, a professor at Leiden University who studies China\u2019s digital nationalism and politics in Chinese entertainment.\n\nHollywood has traditionally tried to keep China on board by steering clear of hot-button topics such as the Communist Party and Tibet, inserting positive images of China into movies such as \u201cThe Martian\u201d and \u201cGravity,\u201d and refraining from making villains Chinese.\n\n\u201cThe studios are very aware of what the red lines are and what the points of potential contention are,\u201d says Aynne Kokas, author of \u201cHollywood Made in China.\u201d \u201cFor people who have been paying attention, this is not something that happened suddenly. It\u2019s the next step in a long, iterative process.\u201d\n\nOne fear is that the NBA and \u201cSouth Park\u201d imbroglios will encourage Western companies to practice even more self-censorship regarding China.\n\n\u201cWhat Hollywood and other corpora\u00ad\u00adtions want is for these issues not to come up in the first place,\u201d says Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan\n\nAsia Society. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the business climate for a lot of American corporations right now is such that they\u2019re going to work to make sure that these issues in China are not talked about publicly in the hopes that they won\u2019t get attacked and they won\u2019t be in a position of having to defend Beijing\u2019s response.\u201d\n\nBut as the situation in Hong Kong grows more intractable and divisive, that studious avoidance may become harder.\n\nThe NBA found itself in a lose-lose situation, unable to publicly reprimand Morey without causing a firestorm back in the U.S., but faced with China\u2019s wrath over the perceived slight to its sovereignty. Likewise for Hollywood, moves seen as accommodating the Chinese government\u2019s effort to control information and stifle dissent can be politically tricky in the U.S., especially among outspoken entertainment industry figures such as George Clooney.", "description": "The Oct. 12 game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets in the Chinese city of Shenzhen might have seemed like business as usual, with thousands of basketball fans out in force for the rare opportunity to see their beloved NBA teams compete live.
