So what next for international football's fallen giants?", "language": "en", "text": "On Wednesday night at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Signal Iduna Park, two footballing titans will clash. With six World Cup wins between them, Germany and Argentina need little introduction.\n\nSuch is each nation's might that they have even gone head-to-head in the World Cup final on three occasions - Argentina winning in 1986 before Germany gained revenge in 1990 and 2014.\n\nYet the days of Diego Maradona, Lothar Matthaus and Philipp Lahm are now a distant memory. In just five years since their last World Cup final meeting, Germany suffered their ultimate World Cup humiliation in Russia last summer and continue to limp on amid poor results and political in-fighting. Argentina are stuck in perpetual chaos, no closer to solving their Lionel Messi condundrum and with the quality in their squad sinking fast.\n\nAhead of their friendly meeting, ALEC FENN examines what has gone wrong with both nations, and what the future holds.\n\nJoachim Low has persisted with Manuel Neuer despite the brilliance of Marc-Andre ter Stegen\n\nLionel Messi's influence on Argentina is a continued topic of debate in his homeland\n\nGERMANY\n\nIt's become trendy in football parlance to describe the flux and change of great football teams as cycles. The theory is that after several years of success, silverware is replaced with staleness and so a period of rebuilding ensues, during which results suffer as new signings adapt and young players develop and strive to reach the level of their predecessors.\n\nIn international football, it's a process that occurs between major tournaments, with the four-year gap between World Cups allowing for the maturity of a new breed of players or the gradual integration of a new style of football. For Germany, their disastrous group stage exit at the 2018 World Cup, four years on from winning the tournament in Brazil, has signalled the start of a new cycle as Die Mannschaft bid to repeat the magical memories of the Maracana.\n\nGermany boss Low also appears unsure how to use the mercurial Kai Havertz (left)\n\nYet their desire for change has been compromised by the decision to keep faith with Joachim Low, who has now been at the helm for 13 years. To enact real change, Low must not only reinvent his team but also himself. He has at least made a bold attempt to do the former after freezing out three of his longest serving players, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels and Thomas Muller, in a bid to take a long-term approach and blood players who will peak when the next World Cup comes around in 2022.\n\nMesut Ozil's self-imposed international retirement, following his accusations of institutionalised racism in Germany, has also changed the face of the team. But Ilkay Gundogan, who was also caught up in the furore involving their meeting with controversial Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, remains in the set-up despite the national crisis it provoked. He is, however, injured for this game.\n\nThe Germans are without nearly a dozen players for the game, including Toni Kroos, Leroy Sane, Antonio Rudiger, Timo Werner, Leon Goretzka and Matthias Ginter among others.\n\nGERMANY SQUAD Goalkeepers: Manuel Neuer (captain - Bayern Munich) Bernd Leno (Arsenal) Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona) Defenders: Robin Koch (Freiburg) Lukas Klostermann (RB Leipzig) Niklas Sule (Bayern Munich) Marcel Halstenberg (RB Leipzig) Niklas Stark (Hertha Berlin) Midfielders: Suat Serdar (Schalke) Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich) Kai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen) Nadiem Amiri (Bayer Leverkusen) Sebastian Rudy (Hoffenheim) Emre Can (Juventus) Forwards: Timo Werner (RB Leipzig) Luca Waldschmidt (Freiburg) Serge Gnabry (Bayern Munich) Julian Brandt (Borussia Dortmund) Marco Reus (Borussia Dortmund)\n\nUnsurprisingly, there have been teething problems with Low's reinvention. Centre-backs Matthias Ginter and Jonathan Tah were criticised after the 4-2 Euro 2020 qualification defeat to Holland and their struggles have coincided with Hummels' renaissance for Borussia Dortmund. His experience and calmness in possession, qualities desperately lacking in Germany's new-look backline, have led to calls for a recall. Low, so far, has resisted, in the knowledge that Hummels' return would only provide a short-term fix and challenge the belief he has in his new methods.\n\nGermany are certainly not short of talent, but that has created an indecisiveness that is Low's Achilles heel. Low has persisted with Manuel Neuer as his first-choice goalkeeper, despite numerous injuries, a drop in form and the continued brilliance of Marc-Andre ter Stegen for Barcelona.\n\nTer Stegen's frustration at being overlooked spilled out in a recent interview, during which he admitted he felt he deserved his chance, and led to a public spat between him and Neuer. Bayern president Uli Hoeness then threatened to stop Neuer from joining up with Germany if he was dropped, before the club later withdrew his comments. Low has since confirmed Ter Stegen and Neuer will play one match each in their upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers.\n\nWhile the rivalry between his two goalkeepers rumbles on, he must also map out the future of Germany's brightest young talent. At 20, the mercurial Kai Havertz has already scored 26 goals and made 20 assists in 95 Bundesliga games and yet Low appears unsure how to integrate him into his side.\n\nNorthern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill admitted he feared Havertz would start in September's clash between the two nations, only for the youngster to be given just 20 minutes from the bench, though it was still enough for him to assist Serge Gnabry for the second goal in a 2-0 win at Windsor Park.\n\nAfterwards Low insisted he would find a place for the midfielder in his starting XI, but when and how he does remains to be seen.\n\nCentre-backs Matthias Ginter and Jonathan Tah were criticised after the defeat to Holland\n\nBut one player who has managed to convince Low of his talents is Sane. The winger was a shock omission from Germany's World Cup squad in 2018 but Low switched to a 3-5-2 formation to get the best out of arguably his most talented player. The Manchester City man often operates as a striker for the national team and is joined in attack by either Bayern Munich's Gnabry or Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus. Their attacking prowess has fired Germany to four wins from five games in Euro 2020 qualification Group C ahead of Wednesday's clash with Argentina and gives Germany hope that their new cycle will be as successful as their last.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Sane's serious knee injury, which has ruined his season - and, arguably, City's - will alter Low's plans, both short and long-term. Although Dortmund's Julian Brandt looks to be one player who will benefit from Sane's misery.\n\nARGENTINA\n\nWhile Germany undergo a gradual but hesitant rebuilding process, Argentina are stuck in a perpetual cycle of organised chaos and crushing disappointment. A World Cup that saw a mauling by Croatia, and an embarrassing draw with Iceland, has been followed by a semi-final defeat to Brazil at last summer's Copa America. That heaped more misery on a nation who haven't won a major international tournament since lifting the Copa America back in 1993.\n\nThe fall-out from the 2019 edition of the tournament was predictable. Lionel Messi was blamed for his failure to transfer his performances for Barcelona to the international stage and pilloried for not inspiring Argentina in the manner Cristiano Ronaldo has done in the colours of Portugal. But the truth is that La Albiceleste's troubles run far deeper than Messi.\n\nOver the past 14 years - longer than Messi's international career - Argentina have had employed nine different coaches. The likes of Jorge Sampaoli, Gerardo Martino and Jose Pekerman were hired with public support and boasted impressive CVs, but others, notably Diego Maradona, were appointed on an emotional whim, with little thought given to a long-term strategy aligned to a philosophy that would make the most of their attacking talents.\n\nRelatively unknown Franco Armani has been preferred to Willy Caballero and Sergio Romero\n\nThe finger of blame for that continued lack of foresight should lay firmly at the door of the Argentine Football Association. A desire to win at all costs has seen strategy traded for immediacy, which has resulted in organisational chaos and a lack of direction on the pitch. After dismissing Sampaoli in August 2018, Lionel Scaloni was appointed caretaker manager and then asked to remain in the role for the tournament despite having never taken charge of a competitive game of football prior to assuming the role.\n\nThe decision was a bizarre one, particularly given Argentina's embarrassment of coaching riches. The nation has produced the managers of both Copa Libertadores finalists and one of the Champions League finalists, the manager of the previous season's Europa League and Copa Sudamericana winners and five managers at last summer's World Cup, meaning Scaloni was way down a lengthy pecking order of Argentina's best coaches.\n\nAs a result, it was little wonder that erraticism was a theme throughout Argentina's Copa America campaign. La Albiceleste have long boasted an array of attacking talent and were able to call upon Messi, Sergio Aguero, Angel Di Maria, Paulo Dybala and Lautaro Martinez in Brazil, but the side resembled fragmented pieces of a jigsaw tossed together with little consideration given to how they would fit together as part of a whole.\n\nDecision to appoint Lionel Scaloni was bizarre, given Argentina's embarrassment of riches\n\nARGENTINA SQUAD Goalkeepers: Agustin Marchesin (Porto) Juan Musso (Udinese) Emiliano Martinez (Arsenal) Defenders: Nicolas Otamendi (Manchester City) Marcos Rojo (Manchester United) Nicolas Tagliafico (Ajax) German Pezzella (Fiorentina) Juan Foyth (Tottenham) Renzo Saravia (Porto) Walter Kannemann (Gremio) Leonardo Balerdi (Borussia Dortmund) Midfielders: Erik Lamela (Tottenham) Marcos Acuna (Sporting Lisbon) Leandro Paredes (Paris Saint-Germain) Roberto Pereyra (Watford) Rodrigo De Paul (Udinese) Guido Rodriguez (Mexico America) Nicolas Dom\u00ednguez (Velez Sarsfield) Lucas Ocampos (Sevilla) Forwards: Paulo Dybala (Juventus) Lautaro Mart\u00ednez (Inter Milan) \u00c1ngel Correa (Atletico Madrid) Lucas Alario (Bayer Leverkusen) Matias Vargas (Espanyol) Nicolas Gonzalez (Stuttgart)\n\nMessi's influence on Argentina is a continued topic of debate in his homeland and quite possibly inside his own head. His presence has often created an apparent pressure for other attacking talents, notably Dybala, to pass to him in the final third rather than trust their own instincts, which has made Argentina predictable and easy to decode against the game's elite nations. His role also sees him do considerably less pressing in the final third than he did in his mid-20s, leaving his team-mates to pick up the defensive slack.\n\nMessi will miss the match in Dortmund as he is still serving a three-month ban for criticising the referee after he was sent off in the third-place play-off at the Copa America. Di Maria and Aguero have been left out of Scaloni's squad too, adding yet more uncertainty.\n\nArgentina's inability to knit together their attacking talents has been further compounded by a dearth of defensive talent. The back four that started the semi-final defeat to Brazil featured Tottenham's Juan Foyth, who has been unable to establish himself as a first team regular at club level and Nicolas Otamendi, whose star has fallen amid poor form for Manchester City.\n\nThe goalkeeping position is another long-standing issue and resulted in the relatively unknown Franco Armani being given the No 1 jersey following Willy Caballero and Sergio Romero's lack of playing time for Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nThe result is a nation in disarray ahead of Wednesday's game. In their two encounters since the Copa America, Argentina drew 0-0 with Chile before beating Mexico 4-0, but that victory has done little to paper over their sizeable cracks.\n\nIf they are to challenge for next summer's Copa America, which will be played across Argentina and Colombia, they must appoint an experienced coach with a long-term blueprint wrapped around a defined style of football that allows Messi to flourish in sync with his international team-mates. If they don't, their perpetual cycle of disappointment will roll on and on.", "description": "With six World Cup wins between them, Germany and Argentina need little introduction.
