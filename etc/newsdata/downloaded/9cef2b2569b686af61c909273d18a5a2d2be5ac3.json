and trade association UK Finance have written to payments body Pay.UK, urging it to approve a plan to ensure bank transfer fraud victims continue to get their money back in the \"no blame scenario\" - when both they and their payment service provider has done everything expected of them under the voluntary code.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nWhich? said the final decision sits with Pay.UK, \"which now has the important task of either ensuring the favoured industry and consumer group proposal is agreed, or making a decision that risks blameless scam victims being left unprotected from January 1\".\n\nUK Finance jointly wrote on behalf of HSBC, Santander, Barclays, Lloyds, Metro, Nationwide and RBS.\n\nWhich? said the proposal - for banks to pay a small fee on some transfers to collectively fund a \"no blame\" reimbursement pot - was agreed and submitted following months of talks involving banks and consumer representatives.\n\nA 2.9p levy would be applied to some types of faster payment.\n\nLosses to this type of scam - also known as authorised push payment (APP) scams rose to \u00a3147 million in the first six months of this year.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIn their letter, Which? chief executive Anabel Hoult and Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, warn: \"Authorised push payment (APP) fraud is a crime which can have a devastating impact on its victims, which is why protecting consumers is a priority for us all.\n\n\"The proposal set out... will provide a long-term, sustainable funding system for the reimbursement of victims of APP scams under the voluntary code in situations where both the customer and payment service provider have done everything expected of them, known as a 'no blame' situation.\n\n\"If the Pay.UK board fails to pass the change request, many victims of APP scams could once again risk losing their life savings to this devastating crime.\"\n\nWhich? said it believes it is important for the scheme to be collectively funded by the industry to give all firms an incentive to individually and collectively work to prevent scams from happening in the first place.\n\nIt said a consultation closed on October 1 and Pay.UK's decision is expected to be made public in November - just a month before the current interim funding deal expires.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAnabel Hoult, chief executive, Which?, said: \"Great strides have been made towards offering consumers greater protection against bank transfer scams - and we believe this proposal is the best way of ensuring blameless fraud victims will continue to be reimbursed.\n\n\"Time is running out to agree a solution, so we urge Pay.UK to accept this important proposal - as it is unthinkable that we could see a return to the dark days of blameless victims losing their life savings to this devastating crime.\"\n\nJones said: \"Protecting customers from fraud is a priority for the finance industry.\n\n\"The proposal by seven payment service providers of a per-transaction fee on certain faster payments would offer a long-term, sustainable funding system for reimbursing victims of APP scams where both the customer and payment service provider have done everything expected of them.\n\n\"Yet even when a customer is reimbursed, the money stolen still ends up in the pockets of organised criminal gangs involved in drugs, arms and human trafficking.\n\n\"That is why the finance industry remains focused on stopping fraud occurring in the first place and helping law enforcement to apprehend and disrupt those responsible.\n\n\"Criminals continue to exploit vulnerabilities outside of the finance industry, such as third-party data breaches, so it is important that all sectors take responsibility for tackling fraud and support victims.\"", "description": "More than \u00a3147million was lost to authorised push payment scams in the first six months of this year", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Bloomberg Via Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18945089.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Vintage-filtered-on-silhouette-of-depressed-girl-sitting-on-the-window.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
