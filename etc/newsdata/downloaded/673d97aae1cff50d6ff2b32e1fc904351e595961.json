The work \u2014 flushing the water system with chlorine \u2014 was to be completed Oct. 11, and testing for residual bacteria was to last two days.\n\nAD\n\nWayne Turnage, the city\u2019s deputy mayor of Health and Human Services, said in a statement late Thursday that testing continued to show legionella within the hospital\u2019s water system.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAfter super chlorination of the water system, test results showed evidence of remaining bacteria,\u201d he said.\n\nTurnage said the water system was being treated Friday in a process that will continue through the weekend. Potable water will return \u201cwhen test results show the water is safe to use,\u201d he said, although officials didn\u2019t give a precise date.\n\nCity officials didn\u2019t respond to questions about how the bacteria survived the treatment.\n\nAndrea Procaccino, a staff lawyer at Disability Rights DC, which advocates for patients at St. Elizabeths, said she spent hours Friday visiting with patients there. She said that portable showers aren\u2019t accessible for patients in wheelchairs and that many older patients are unwilling to use them.\n\nAD\n\nThe showers are outside, she said, and some women don\u2019t feel safe walking to them or bathing with male security guards nearby. Some patients are being kept on locked wards longer than usual because common areas where art and group therapy are held don\u2019t have water, she said, and others haven\u2019t showered in weeks.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now been 22 days that patients and staff cannot shower, wash their hands or drink the water,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried they don\u2019t have a Plan B here. What if it\u2019s just positive again? Are they going to move people?\u201d\n\nCity officials say it\u2019s not clear how the bacteria got into the water system. Rayna Smith, chief of staff for Turnage, said the cause of the problem is under investigation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to get the issue resolved as soon as possible,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAs soon as test results determine that water is safe for consumption, we will immediately return to normal operations.\u201d\n\nAdvocates said they were frustrated that it took the city several days to start remediation. Patients are receiving hot meals served on paper plates from an outside vendor because dishwashers can\u2019t be used as the water system is being flushed.\n\nAD\n\nThe psychiatric hospital has 273 patients and 700 employees. Some patient advocates have expressed concerns that St. Elizabeths continues to admit patients as it struggles with water accessibility.\n\nAlong with legionella bacteria, which can cause Legionnaires\u2019 disease, the routine testing of the water system revealed pseudo\u00admonas bacteria, which can lead to severe infections in people with weakened immune systems.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 6,000 cases of the pneumonialike Legionnaires\u2019 disease were reported in the United States in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease is fatal in about 10 percent of cases where people get sick, the CDC said.\n\nMany St. Elizabeths patients are criminal defendants, including those awaiting competency hearings and others found not guilty by reason of insanity. The hospital has a history of problems, beginning decades before the District took it over in 1987.\n\nAD\n\nIn the 1970s, patients sued over poor conditions. In 2006, the Justice Department found that the hospital\u2019s conditions violated patients\u2019 constitutional rights, and the District entered into a consent decree from 2007 until 2014.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1965, when St. Elizabeths was run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, several patients died after an outbreak of what was then called \u201cSt. Elizabeths fever.\u201d About 12 years later, CDC scientists figured out that the illness was Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\n\nAD", "description": "The psychiatric hospital in Southeast Washington hasn\u2019t had potable water in several weeks.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News", "Justin Wm.
