This year, however, sales in July and August skyrocketed 52 percent compared to May and June.The local beer brand attributed its expansion of distributing retailers and the boycott on Japanese products as the reasons for the sales jump. The brewery claims it is the only craft beer maker in Korea to be distributed at more than 90 percent of discount marts and convenience stores.The growing popularity of craft beer on top of the boycott has also helped sales. Koreans have been refusing to purchase Japanese products following Japan\u2019s export restrictions against Korea in early July.Asahi had been heavily hit by the boycott this summer. Asahi beer, which was the best-selling beer at local convenience stores, lost the No. 1 spot to Oriental Brewery\u2019s Cass beer.Lotte Liquor has also been affected by the boycott.Lotte Liquor on Tuesday said in a statement that it will take legal action against \u201crumors that Japan\u2019s Asahi has shares in Lotte Liquor.\u201dLotte argued that some of its products have been highlighted as possible boycott items.
