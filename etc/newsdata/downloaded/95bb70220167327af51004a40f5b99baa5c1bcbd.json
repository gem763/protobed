The rest was mostly excruciating.\n\nBaker Mayfield and Co. aren\u2019t living up to expectations - theirs or anyone else\u2019s.\n\nMayfield threw three more interceptions, Nick Chubb had a costly fumble and Cleveland had a punt blocked Sunday during a 32-28 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, dropping the Browns to 0-3 at home and into their bye week searching for answers.\n\nThe Browns (2-4) couldn\u2019t sustain momentum after scoring touchdowns on their first three drives, and Mayfield, who now leads the NFL with 11 interceptions, was slowed by a hip injury in the second half.\n\n\u201cKind of tender right now,\u201d Mayfield said, describing his hip and unintentionally labeling Cleveland\u2019s season.\n\nAfter six games, the Browns are bruised.\n\nThey led 20-6 just six seconds into the second quarter when Mayfield connected with tight end Ricky Seals-Jones for a 31-yard touchdown pass.\n\nBut it was downhill from there as Mayfield couldn\u2019t match Russell Wilson, who rallied the Seahawks (5-1) to another tight win.\n\n\u201cWe had turnovers every which way,\u201d wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. said. \u201cHad the game in our hands and let it get away.\u201d\n\nMayfield and Cleveland\u2019s offense showed some signs of improvement. Coach Freddie Kitchens\u2019 game plan was to get Beckham more involved, and he finished with six catches for 101 yards while being targeted 11 times.\n\nBut the Browns were done in by mistakes, self-inflicted ones, with the last an interception by Mayfield with 2:46 on a pass that hit running back Dontrell Hilliard\u2019s hands but was thrown behind him.\n\n\u201cTough catch for him,\u201d said Mayfield, who went 22 of 37 for 249 yards and scored on a 10-yard run. \u201cJust seems a lot of those bounces right there are not going in our favor.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true the Browns hurt themselves, but they didn\u2019t get any favors from the officiating crew.\n\nOne call that really miffed Mayfield came in the third quarter when wide receiver Jarvis Landry was called for an illegal blindside block on Seahawks safety Marquise Blair. Cleveland trailed 25-20 at the time.\n\n\u201cThe refs are never an excuse,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cI will probably get fined for saying this, but it was pretty bad today. The guy is squared up with him, running at him and he is lowering his head into Jarvis. What is (Landry) supposed to do? Avoid him? This is not bullfighting. I don\u2019t know. It ticks me off.\u201d\n\nLandry bolted after the game without speaking to reporters.\n\nKitchens had plenty of reasons to be peeved, but he was careful not to publicly poke the officials.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not commenting on officiating,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a memo the other day. I\u2019m not commenting on it. You guys saw the game.\u201d\n\nCleveland was called for nine penalties, Seattle for 10.\n\nThe Browns have been undisciplined since Week 1, when they were penalized 18 times in a loss to Tennessee. They\u2019ve cleaned things up a bit, but Kitchens said his team must do a better job of not imploding.\n\n\u201cIt is a factor of not focusing, not concentrating,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, it is playing with emotion instead of passion. After-the-whistle (penalties) are emotion instead of passion. During the play, it is technique, being lazy or not doing your job. There are several things. We do not ever practice penalties.\u201d\n\nBrowns defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson was more direct in questioning the officiating.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what them penalty calls was,\u201d he said. \u201cThey let other teams play football, but us . it\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s just annoying playing handcuffed.\u201d\n\nRichardson was asked if the calls were affecting the Browns, altering the way they play.\n\n\u201cWatch the film,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time we get momentum it\u2019s always something. A phantom here, a holding there, whatever the case may be, roughing the passer when the quarterback\u2019s still got the ball in his hands. It\u2019s football. When you leave it up to judgment calls, that\u2019s what happens. You take the game out of the players\u2019 hands and you put it in the referees\u2019 - it\u2019s just that simple.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s football. It\u2019s violent. It\u2019s aggressive. It is what it is. It\u2019s barbaric and people want it to be nice. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n\nThe Browns will get some time to reassess their fading season before visiting New England in two weeks.\n\nMayfield said it\u2019s imperative he and his teammates turn their uneven start into a positive.\n\n\u201cThe great teams learn from their mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey learn from games like these. The certain plays that you can look back on and say, \u2018This would have made the difference.\u2019 You learn from it and you move forward. This hurts, but the good teams learn from it.\n\n\u201cDown the road, our plan is that it is going to be better for us in the long run and that is how we have to look at it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Browns' start was exhilarating.
