REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s government accused the opposition Labour Party of \u201ctrying to propagate myths\u201d by suggesting a possible conflict of interest between Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s stance on Brexit and hedge funds betting against sterling.\n\nLabour\u2019s John McDonnell, the party\u2019s top finance official, said on Saturday he had asked Mark Sedwill, the government\u2019s cabinet secretary, to investigate any conflict of interest after former finance minister Philip Hammond said \u201cspeculators\u201d who backed Johnson stood to profit from a falling pound in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSimon Clarke, a junior minister in Britain\u2019s Treasury, told lawmakers on Monday that the government rejected any conflict of interest and he said Labour\u2019s actions were an attempt to \u201cthrow mud\u201d in the House of Commons in parliament.\n\n\u201cThey amount, frankly, to trying to propagate myths, to smear, and indeed, of course, in a week when we are trying to lower the temperature in the House they seem intended to stoke it,\u201d Clarke said.", "description": "Britain's government accused the opposition Labour Party of \"trying to propagate myths\" by suggesting a possible conflict of interest between Prime Minister Boris Johnson's stance on Brexit and hedge funds betting against sterling.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435545440&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0Z4", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
