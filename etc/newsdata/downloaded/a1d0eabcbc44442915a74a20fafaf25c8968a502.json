Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) are antisemitic despite their history of controversial comments.\n\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t believe in any kind of antisemitism,\u201d Castro said.\n\n\u201cSo will you condemn Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib for their antisemitism?\u201d Breitbart News\u2019s Aaron Klein asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know which comment you\u2019re talking about, so all I can speak to is, and I believe \u2014 I don\u2019t believe that they are antisemitic,\u201d Castro said.\n\nThe presidential hopeful was presented with Omar\u2019s remark about support for Israel being \u201call about the Benjamins,\u201d but he willfully ignored the example.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe they are \u2013\u201d Castro began as he walked away, refusing to address Omar\u2019s specific remarks.\n\nThe far-left \u201cSquad\u201d members have a well-documented history of questionable racist statements, as Breitbart News has extensively detailed:\n\nOmar has a long history of anti-Israel statements that have included antisemitic themes, such as suggesting that Jews control the world. In 2012, she tweeted: \u201cIsrael has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.\u201d Local Jewish community leaders in Minnesota staged an intervention before she took up her seat in Congress \u2014 to no avail; she continued making offensive anti-Israel and antisemitic statements. In February, Omar tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby,\u201d suggesting (falsely) that a pro-Israel group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), bribed members of Congress to support Israel. The implication was that Jews were using money to control Congress. Omar apologized for that tweet, but went on, a few weeks later, to claim that pro-Israel members of Congress owed \u201callegiance to a foreign country.\u201d The chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a fellow Democrat, called her statement a \u201cvile antisemitic slur,\u201d but she refused to apologize.\n\nOmar\u2019s remarks in February \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby\u201d \u2014 eventually sparked House Democrats to pass a resolution aimed at condemning antisemitism. However, the resolution was broadened to cover various forms of hate and failed to mention Omar by name.\n\nTlaib has also come under fire for antisemitic remarks.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nTlaib believes that the State of Israel has no right to exist and should be dismantled \u2014 a stance that lost her the support of the far-left J Street organization, which likes to maintain the pretense of support for a two-state solution. In January, Tlaib posted an antisemitic tweet, declaring that members of Congress who supported Israel \u201cforgot what country they represent.\u201d The American Jewish Committee accused her of using an antisemitic claim of \u201cdual loyalty.\u201d In February, Tlaib called Housing and Urban Development official Lynne Patton, a black woman, a \u201cprop\u201d for appearing in the gallery during a hearing where members of Congress were debating whether Trump was racist. In May, Tlaib made the bizarre statement that she felt \u201ca calming feeling \u2026 when I think of the Holocaust.\u201d She explained by making the false claim that Palestinians had offered Jews a \u201csafe haven\u201d from the Holocaust.\n\nTlaib, Omar, and \u201cSquad\u201d ringleader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) are expected to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) presidential bid, according to reports that coincided with Tuesday\u2019s political event.\n\nCastro, who failed to score a high-profile \u201cSquad\u201d endorsement, did not experience a breakout moment during Tuesday\u2019s debate. He did not crack one percent in the Drudge Report\u2019s online post-debate poll (as of midnight), signaling a lack of enthusiasm amongst his supporters.", "description": "Juli\u00e1n Castro told Breitbart News after Tuesday night's debate that he does not believe Reps.
