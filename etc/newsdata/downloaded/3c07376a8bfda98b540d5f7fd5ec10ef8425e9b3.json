Rand Paul said a CIA whistleblower\u2019s accusations against President Trump are so serious that stepping forward is the right thing for that individual to do.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican told an audience of local leaders this week that circumstances surrounding the complaint regarding Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are such that anonymity does the nation a disservice.\n\n\u201cUltimately, if someone\u2019s going to accuse you of something that\u2019s going to bring down a presidency, I think we deserve to know who that person is,\u201d Mr. Paul said Tuesday, a local NBC affiliate reported. \u201cOur criminal justice system is usually predicated upon: if I accuse you of something, I\u2019ve got to show up in court and accuse you of it. So, I think there are reasons to have whistleblower statutes and have anonymity. If you\u2019re accusing somebody of something with the ramifications of impeachment, I think really the person ought to come forward.\u201d\n\nProminent Democrats maintain that it was an impeachable offense for Mr. Trump to ask the Ukrainian leader to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, his political rival, and an abandoned prosecution into Burisma Holdings, where Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter sat on the energy company\u2019s board. They also are questioning why congressionally approved money for Ukraine was delayed.\n\nMr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201c[Joe] Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSee if you can look into it. \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul said that efforts to impeach Mr. Trump would ultimately be seen as \u201ca partisan thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go anywhere,\u201d he told the station. \u201cI do think that one of the things that\u2019s been lost in all of this is: Do we really want to listen to all of the president\u2019s phone calls? Should we be listening to all of the president\u2019s phone calls? And should we then be making them public because we disagree with something he said in the phone call?\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
