(Photo: 4WWL)\n\nAn employee at a New Orleans McDonald\u2019s allegedly attacked a customer who complained about a cold order of fries.\n\nLast week, the customer, who was on vacation with his wife in the Louisiana city, had complained to staff that his order of French fries was cold. The man, who wished to remain unnamed, admitted to news station 4WWL that while he was abrasive to the staff, he didn\u2019t expect the incident to evolve into a violent one.\n\nThe altercation was caught on camera and shows the customer holding his food while an angry employee charges at him. \u201cYou gonna get out? Get out!\u201d the employee yelled at the patron in the video.\n\nAnother co-worker intervenes and pulls the employee away, but the fight escalates when the customer follows him. The employee then puts his hands around the man\u2019s neck and punches him in the head.\n\n\u201cI'm a big, big boy,\u201d the customer told 4WWL. \u201cBigger than he is, but I didn't fight back. It was embarrassing. I didn\u2019t want to leave my wife alone in New Orleans if I went to jail. If this happened to me in McDonald\u2019s what could happen to her on these streets?\"\n\nAccording to NOLA.com, the police arrive on the scene, but no charges were filed. Now, the customer is demanding that charges are filed against his aggressor.\n\n\u201cIf I could make sense of it I'd tell you, but I don't have a clue,\u201d the customer told 4WWL. \u201cThe customer is always right, even if he's wrong.\u201d\n\nAccording to the news network, the employee was spotted still working at the same McDonald\u2019s franchise on Sunday. When questioned, franchise owner Chris Bardell replied that \u201cthe behavior seen in this video is not what I expect from my employees, we are conducting a thorough investigation of this incident.\"\n\nYahoo reached out to the McDonald\u2019s corporation and the New Orleans Police Department for comment, but did not received an immediate response.\n\nVideo: McDonald\u2019s Offers Harassment Training to US Workers\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:", "description": "The New Orleans McDonald\u2019s employee punched a customer who complained about his cold French fries.", "authors": ["Megan Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R7jQb2.9F7axvX7H4J4BtA--~B/aD01NTQ7dz0xMDQ4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/5277fb20-d1a3-11e9-9d6d-7fc6183b2d3c", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
