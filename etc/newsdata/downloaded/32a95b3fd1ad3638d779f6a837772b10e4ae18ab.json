Narratives are a powerful thing in the alt world. Important to recognize that almost every alt move is a *trading* opportunity. Not the same as $BTC. I don\u2019t tweet much about alts anymore but the inefficiencies will always keep me interested,\u201d he said while pointing to the below chart.\n\n$NEO outperforming 7-10% in 7hrs.
