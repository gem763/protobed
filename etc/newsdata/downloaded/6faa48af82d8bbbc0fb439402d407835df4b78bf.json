Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).\n\nHarris, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which conducted Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process, announced her call for a formal impeachment inquiry in an essay for Elle Magazine published Friday morning. The senator wrote that the government must investigate whether Kavanaugh lied under oath during his confirmation hearing last year.\n\nThree women accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault or misconduct last year during the justice\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation process. One of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, delivered an emotional testimony in front of the entire country about her accusation that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when they were in high school. Just this month, two New York Times reporters surfaced another account of alleged sexual misconduct against him.\n\nHarris argued in her letter to Nadler and her essay for Elle that this fourth accusation suggests the judge may have lied under oath and that the original investigation into these claims was not sufficient enough.\n\n\u201cIf we want to live in a country where women are believed and given access to the justice they deserve, we must roll up our sleeves and get to work holding our leaders accountable,\u201d Harris wrote. \u201cEspecially those who serve on the highest court in our land.\u201d\n\nAlthough the House Judiciary Committee is \u201crightfully busy\u201d with the recent impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Harris wrote, the country \u201cshouldn\u2019t let a crowded schedule get in the way of justice.\u201d\n\nHarris was one of many presidential hopefuls who called for impeachment earlier this month when the most recent accusation of sexual misconduct was published.\n\n\u201cI sat through those hearings,\u201d Harris tweeted Sept. 15. \u201cBrett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached.\u201d\n\nRead Harris\u2019 full letter to Rep. Nadler calling for a formal impeachment inquiry into Kavanaugh below.\n\nHead over to Elle to read Harris\u2019 full essay.", "description": "The presidential hopeful wrote that we must \"get to work holding our leaders accountable\" in the wake of a new sexual misconduct claim against the Suprem...", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e02202100005f005fb965.jpeg?cache=dygmjbb8qq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
