Nervous for what that means and how people will react, but excited because I haven\u2019t competed in 15 months, and excited to get this started,' Eastwood told Bozeman Daily Chronicles.\n\nThe debate surrounding transgender athletes in sports, which are generally based on gender, has become a hot button issue in daily discourse.\n\nThose who oppose transgender females competing in sports usually cite hormonal factors like higher testosterone levels in trans women and physiological features like height and weight.\n\nSupporters point out that sports of all levels have been categorized by gender and transgender females should compete in the gender division they identify as.\n\nBefore identifying as June, Eastwood (pictured) was a standout athlete in high school and competed on the University of Montana's men's team\n\nIn June's case, and other collegiate transgender athletes, the NCAA's policy allows male athletes to compete in women's athletics under certain guidelines.\n\nThe policy dictates that male runners who identify as transgender women must suppress testosterone levels for a full calendar year before competing in women's sports.\n\nIn a 2011 handbook, the NCAA sought advice from medical professionals familiar with the 'complexities of the transitioning student-athlete.'\n\nIt subsequently determined that it's not warranted to assume: 'that being born with a male body automatically gives a transgender woman an unfair advantage when competing against non-transgender women.'\n\nPictured: Eastwood running during warm-up with her teammates after identifying as a transgender female\n\nHowever, other medical professionals have said that transgender woman have an advantage over cis-gendered women.\n\nIn a study in the Journal of Medical Ethics, they said there is little evidence to show testosterone mitigates past muscle mass.\n\n'In addition, the phenomenon of muscle memory means muscle mass and strength can be rebuilt with previous strength exercise making it easier to regain muscle mass later in life even after long intervening periods of inactivity and mass loss,' the authors said according to the Daily Caller.\n\nAs it stands now, more research will need to conducted in the upcoming years to fully understand the several factors surrounding the topic.\n\nThe announcement of Eastwood's entry into the women's division has sparked both support and criticism\n\nAfter word of Eastwood's accolade spread, people across social media had varying reactions.\n\nSome people supported Eastwood and congratulated her on the accomplishment.\n\nOne person wrote: 'Honestly never thought I'd say this but \"Go lady Griz!!\" Congrats June!'\n\n'Looking forward to watching her run- she is an amazing athlete,' another wrote.\n\nA Twitter user said: 'Super excited and proud that June gets to experience this journey at the U of M. Best of luck!'\n\nOthers said the recognition was uncalled for.\n\n'This is hurting female competitors, and is completely unfair,' one person said.\n\nIn May, the House of Representatives voted to approve the Equality Act, a policy that would requite all schools to allow male athletes who identify as transgender women to compete in women's sports.\n\nRegardless, Eastwood and the University of Montana team will be competing in the Big Sky Conference Championship.", "description": "Transgender female runner June Eastwood of the University of Montana has been named Female Athlete of the Week to mixed reactions after placing second place in a recent race", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/14/20216454-0-image-a-8_1572095668242.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
