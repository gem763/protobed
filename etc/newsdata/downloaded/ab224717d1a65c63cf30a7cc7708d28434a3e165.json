As I write this column on Friday evening, no indictment has been returned against McCabe. From this, and what seems to be some hopeful speculation about \u201chints of the case\u2019s weakness\u201d that could possibly have caused grand jurors to \u201cbalk,\u201d the Times and the Post suggest that maybe the grand jury has voted against an indictment.\n\nUS ATTORNEY RECOMMENDS PROCEEDING WITH CHARGES AGAINST MCCABE, AS DOJ REJECTS LAST-DITCH APPEAL\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThis supposition has prompted a letter to the Justice Department from McCabe\u2019s attorney, Michael Bromwich \u2014 a former colleague of mine who, besides being a skilled and shrewd attorney, is a Democrat and was last seen representing Christine Blasey Ford, Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser. Bromwich says he is hearing \u201crumors from reporters\u201d about the filing of a \u201cno true bill\u201d \u2014 i.e., a grand-jury vote rejecting a proposed indictment of McCabe.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile conceding that he \u201cdo[es] not know the specific basis for the rumors,\u201d Bromwich intuits that they must be reliable because the newspapers ran with the story. Mind you, neither the Times nor the Post claims to have been told by any grand jurors that they declined to indict McCabe; nor do they report hearing from any knowledgeable government official that a no true bill was voted. Nevertheless, McCabe\u2019s legal team is demanding that the Justice Department disclose whether an indictment was declined and refrain from seeking an indictment in the future.\n\nThis gambit, of course, floats the narrative that the case against McCabe must be crumbling \u2014 the media reports spur the Bromwich letter, which spur more media reports, rinse and repeat. But even allowing for the erosion of standards, this is thin gruel for both news reporting and legal claims.\n\nCLICK HERE TO KEEP READING ANDREW MCCARTHY'S COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY", "description": "In coverage of the Andrew McCabe investigation, there seems to be a lot of adding two plus two and coming up with five.", "authors": ["Andrew Mccarthy", "Andrew C.
