Downing Street had hoped the negotiators would be on a glide path to an agreement at Thursday\u2019s summit, with any deal put to a vote in the House of Commons on Saturday.\n\nIn the talks over the weekend, the UK presented a plan that would involve tracking the destination of all goods entering Northern Ireland and applying differential treatment depending on their final destination.\n\nThe plan would legally leave Northern Ireland in the UK\u2019s customs area, one of Mr Johnson\u2019s political red lines, while \u2014 in theory \u2014 avoiding the need for a hard border in Ireland\n\nMr Barnier told diplomats that there was \u201cno precedent\u201d for such a dual customs system to coexist in one territory given the near-impossibility of tracking where goods end up and the complexity of modern supply chains.\n\nDay by day, it becomes more and more of a stretch. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible. It is very, very demanding \u2014 EU official\n\nIn a statement, the European Commission warned that \u201ca lot of work remains to be done\u201d, adding that negotiations would continue on Monday. Talks had been \u201cconstructive\u201d, it said.\n\nOne EU diplomat said the UK\u2019s blueprint would lead to the \u201cdismantling of the EU\u2019s customs code\u201d and leave the bloc open to widespread fraud in the absence of hard data about whether goods end up in the single market or not.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve told the UK our concerns about the single market and they don\u2019t have any answers to it yet,\u201d said the diplomat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Johnson is due to have another round of calls with senior European leaders to try to drum up support for his deal, including German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nAt the same time the prime minister is still trying to square off potential critics in Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP and among Tory Eurosceptic MPs.\n\nAt Sunday lunchtime Mr Johnson briefed cabinet ministers on the latest state of talks. A government spokesperson said the prime minister reiterated \u201cthat a pathway to a deal could be seen but that there is still a significant amount of work to get there and we must remain prepared to leave on October 31\u201d.\n\nEU officials warned that there was a perilously narrow window available if the two sides were to hammer out a deal for leaders to sign off at this week\u2019s summit.\n\n\u201cDay by day, it becomes more and more of a stretch,\u201d said one official. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible. It is very, very demanding.\u201d\n\nScepticism also remains deep among EU27 states as to whether any deal will ultimately get through the British parliament.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "British plans to keep Northern Ireland in the UK\u2019s customs territory while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland are fiendishly complex and not yet properly worked out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ca66f975854d8eeaf37a477ee3ed1b2c22737f89", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
