This was Wild\u2019s only town hall of the August recess, and she was expecting impeachment to come up.\n\nRather than having attendees line up behind microphones, Wild\u2019s staff had asked constituents to write their questions on notecards for a moderator\u2014Ann Bieber, the college\u2019s president\u2014to read aloud. This format allows a member of Congress to address more topics over the course of an hour-long event, but it also minimizes the opportunity for angry constituents to harangue their representative and create a viral moment that an opponent would use in a campaign ad.\n\nWild didn\u2019t have to wait long\u2014an impeachment question came flying her way before she even got a chance to introduce herself. \u201cWhy have you not come out for\u2014\u201d Bieber began to ask, reading from the first notecard, before Wild cut her off. The crowd chuckled, knowing that the next word was going to be impeachment.\n\nWild made some introductory remarks, noting bills she had introduced and her work on the Education and Labor Committee. Then she asked Bieber to read the first question again.\n\n\u201cWhy have you not come out for impeachment?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Wild replied. \u201cI\u2019m glad that question was asked. I would have addressed it even if it hadn\u2019t been, but I was fairly certain that it would be raised.\u201d The crowd laughed again.\n\nWild noted that she received messages every day from constituents on both sides of the issue. \u201cAny of you who ever heard me on the campaign trail heard me say that I\u2019m not one to jump on a bandwagon on any issue,\u201d she said. She added that while she wasn\u2019t supporting impeachment now, she hadn\u2019t ruled out \u201ceither coming out for it or voting for it if I am satisfied that the evidence is there.\u201d The crowd applauded politely. No one booed, held up signs, or stood up in protest. Over the next hour, Wild answered 27 other questions, including multiple inquiries about gun laws, education, health care, and the environment. Impeachment never resurfaced. \u201cI was kind of surprised there wasn\u2019t more of a protest,\u201d Wild told a group of reporters after the event.\n\nThe audience was mostly an older crowd, nearly entirely white, and while it included some Republicans, generally supportive of Wild. In interviews, attendees expressed the same mix of views on impeachment that the congresswoman told reporters she had been hearing all summer. Sara Whildin, a 72-year-old librarian, told me she had come to the town hall to see whether Wild would come out for impeachment. \u201cFrom my point of view, she\u2019s been slow to move in that direction,\u201d she told me. \u201cI do think there\u2019s a principle to uphold here.\u201d", "description": "Despite impeachment efforts from progressive activists, most of the Democrats who flipped GOP seats in 2018 aren\u2019t ready to go there.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19017640968920/facebook.jpg?1567614414"}
