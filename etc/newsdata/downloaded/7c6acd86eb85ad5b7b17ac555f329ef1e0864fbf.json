Instead of allowing a fourth-grader who uses a wheelchair to miss out, Jim Freeman, a teacher at Tully Elementary School, volunteered to carry 10-year-old Ryan Neighbors on a specially made backpack around the outdoor terrain.\n\nNeighbors\u2019s mother, Shelly King of Louisville, Ky., says that her daughter has spina bifida and has used a wheelchair for her entire life, according to WLKY. Because of the lack of wheelchair access, previous school trips have posed as a challenge for the young girl.\n\nNeighbors's family found out that this year the class would be visiting the Falls of the Ohio park, which they called \"obviously, NOT accessible\" in a post made on Team Ryan\u2019s Facebook page. The family started to plan an \"alternative\" trip just for her.\n\nInstead, Freeman, who teaches the class next door to Neighbors's classroom, stepped in and volunteered to carry her around the park and its fossil beds using a special backpack.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we got her strapped in, she's like, this is the part I've been waiting for,\u201d Freeman told WLKY.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to see the fossils and stuff, I was like, wow, that's like, really cool. I haven't gotten to see that before,\u201d Neighbors told the station.\n\nKing says that Freeman's generosity nearly brought her to tears.\n\n\u201cIt melted my heart,\u201d King said. \u201cHe's not even Ryan\u2019s teacher and he was so pure-hearted that he wanted to make sure that she was included and not left out and she got to feel like one of her peers.\u201d\n\nKing took to social media to praise Freeman and the staff at Jefferson County Public Schools. So far, the post has been shared thousands of times.\n\n\u201cThis is just one physical act that you can see, but we do this countless times throughout the school day and throughout the year,\u201d Freeman told WLKY. \u201cAll the teachers here at Tully and JCPS, they work harder than most people realize.\u201d\n\nFor Neighbors, however, the generous deed provided a lesson that will likely stick with her for years.\n\n\u201cNever feel like you're left alone,\u201d Neighbors said.\n\nKing and representatives for Tully Elementary School did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A teacher volunteered to carry a student who uses a wheelchair on his back during a recent field trip so she wouldn't feel left out.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e3C2BNVAD.hsC_47_q_YnQ--~B/aD02MDA7dz0xMDA2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/cdf4d870-df1a-11e9-be93-b2399c396e56", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
