She was also scheduled to participate in an all-candidates debate for her riding.\n\nThe Greens are hoping for a breakthrough on the Island, and recent polls suggest they may be set to win several of the area's seven seats.\n\nMay's party has experienced a surge in support since the beginning of 2019 but has levelled off at around 10 per cent of public support. Polls suggest the party is doing better in B.C., where both its seats are located, and it sits at around 15 per cent support.\n\nMay's announcement Saturday came around the same time that NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was speaking in Grassy Narrows First Nation in northern Ontario. Singh was addressing the issue of persistent boil-water advisories on First Nations reserve, and his plan to ensure universal access to clean drinking water.\n\nThe NDP and Greens are in direct competition on Vancouver Island, where Singh's party currently holds every seat except May's own.", "description": "The Green party is promising a framework for Indigenous communities to opt out of the Indian Act as part of its strategy for reconciliation.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283122.1569364969!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-abortion-20190910.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
