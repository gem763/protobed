Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker (right) delivered an extraordinary rant at the UK for dominating his tenure\n\nHowever, Remainers including Labour's Hilary Benn want to amend the legislation to guarantee that the Commons will get a vote on automatically prolonging the standstill period.\n\nIt is unclear what Eurosceptic hardliners will do if that bid is successful in the coming days.\n\nSpeaking at the European Parliament in Strasbourg today, Mr Barnier stressed that ratifying the divorce deal is only the start.\n\nHe said rules would have to be established to address the risk of environmental, tax and labour 'dumping', and in terms of cooperation for education exchanges, police, defence and foreign policy.", "description": "Michel Barnier was expected to stand down with the rest of the commission next month, but there are claims he is about to be unveiled as the head of a new 'UK Task Force'.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20032468-0-image-a-8_1571744163280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
