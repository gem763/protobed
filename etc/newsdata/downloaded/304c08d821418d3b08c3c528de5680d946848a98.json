In another bombs could be seen falling on the site followed by a flash and the screen turning grey.\n\nThe head of US Central Command, General Kenneth McKenzie, said the bombing took place after all the attackers and survivors had been evacuated, and was carried out so that the compound near the Turkish border did not become a shrine.\n\nMcKenzie was unable to confirm Trump\u2019s claim that the Isis leader was \u201ccrying, whimpering\u201d in the moments before his death.\n\nHe confirmed that Baghdadi\u2019s remains \u2013 collected after he blew himself up in a tunnel, killing two children he had taken with him \u2013 had been buried at sea. McKenzie said initial reports said three children, but later analysis showed two.\n\nVisual guide to the raid that killed Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Read more\n\nMcKenzie said the US was under no illusions it had destroyed Isis, and warned the group would try to take revenge.\n\n\u201cThey will be dangerous. We suspect they will try some form of retribution attack,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a bloodless future because unfortunately this ideology is going to be out there.\u201d\n\nHowever McKenzie predicted that the campaign against Baghdadi would grind down Isis capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s a way to get to a point where it\u2019s going to be less and less effective over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take them some time to reestablish someone to lead the organisation and during that period of time, their actions may be a little bit disjointed.\u201d\n\nThe CentCom commander denied that the timing of the Saturday night raid on Baghdadi\u2019s compound, which he described as \u201cexquisitely planned\u201d, was dictated by Trump\u2019s order for US troops to withdraw from the border area.\n\n\u201cWe chose the time based on a variety of factors: weather, certainty, lunar data,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cWhile it might have been convenient to use bases there, the US military has the capability to go almost anywhere.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) provided \u201cearly intelligence\u201d which had been very helpful, and the SDF were therefore part of the operation, but did not participate in the raid.\n\nHe did not comment on SDF claims and media reports that the Syrian Kurds had a spy inside Baghdadi\u2019s inner circle, who led US troops to the compound.\n\nMcKenzie said that four women and one man were killed in exchange of fire as US forces assaulted the compound. Two men were taken prisoner.\n\n\u201cAfter this engagement, and once established inside the compound, US forces discovered Baghdadi hiding in a tunnel. When capture at the hands of US forces was imminent, Baghdadi detonated a bomb, killing himself, and two young children that were with him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFollowing collection of samples for formal DNA analysis, Baghdadi\u2019s remains were buried at sea, in accordance with the law of armed conflict within 24 hours of his death.\u201d", "description": "General Kenneth McKenzie says Isis will remain a threat as he shows footage of raid on leader\u2019s Syria hideout", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5384439e8fa6654211e8374f983e5c7ecf4ff21d/133_0_2394_1437/master/2394.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1ab414e658fb4db06d568c9655c80067", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
