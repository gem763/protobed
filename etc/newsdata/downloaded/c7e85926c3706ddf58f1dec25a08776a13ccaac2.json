Upscale properties can typically cost several hundred dollars a night.\n\nIf you prefer a high-end stay at a more accessible price point, there are many hotels that can fit your budget in unexpected places, like Europe, Asia, and the United States.\n\nWe scoured Trip Advisor deals and reviews to determine the highest-rated, best-reviewed hotels around the world for less than $100 a night. Prices reflect time of publication.\n\nLiving in New York can be rough. Someone on the subway just elbowed me in the ribs, and my upstairs neighbors are once again dragging their couch for fun. It\u2019s moments like these I find myself obsessively planning travel. And when I do, I\u2019m the most excited about selecting my hotel.\n\nA great hotel is bliss. It\u2019s a beautiful escape where I\u2019m made to feel special and valued (hopefully anyway), the base from where I will embark on exciting adventures, and where I\u2019ll enjoy sweet, peaceful rest. More than a place to rest my head, the plush serenity of a crisp hotel bed and spa-like bath are unmatched.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, I like nice things. Sadly, they can come with a hefty price tag. Sleek boutique and upscale hotels typically cost anywhere from $250 to thousands of dollars a night, and I\u2019m in no position to regularly spend such funds.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean an affordable dream stay is unattainable. It just requires more research. If you love the feeling of luxury without overpaying, you\u2019ll adore these properties \u2013 especially considering they are all $100 a night or less, subject to availability.\n\nAnd fear not, these are not a \u2018get what you pay for\u2019 situation. I vetted top-ranked hotels around the world on Trip Advisor, my favorite hotel aggregator, sorted by the \u2018Traveler Ranked\u2019 feature. I filtered for price of course, as well as properties rated three stars or above, with a Trip Advisor rating of four plus, and scoured for glowing reviews. I opted for all types of properties, but if you love B&Bs or dislike apartment rentals, be sure to select accordingly. Trip Advisor offers pricing for many outlets, and partners with places like Booking.com, Orbitz, Hotels.com, and others to share the best deals. For the lowest price, try to travel midweek and avoid pricey holidays.\n\nHere\u2019s where you can feel five star at a fraction of the price, around the world.\n\nBrody House, Budapest, $88\n\ncaption Raw materials are edgy and hip. source Brody House\n\nTraveling to Europe can be extremely expensive. Fortunately there are gems like Brody House in Budapest. Budapest\u2019s first private members\u2019 club and guesthouse, the spaces oozes cool factor, with artisan touches, and a thriving onsite community. There are just eight rooms, plus an apartment, all showcasing young artists.\n\nTrip Advisor users rate it a five out of five, including this high endorsement: \u201cMy wife and I stayed at Brody House and had a fantastic time. The old converted building is one of the most unique and beautiful places we\u2019ve ever stayed.\u201d\n\nSapodilla Ubud, Bali, $71\n\ncaption Where to experience Bali, pre-Julia Roberts. source Sapodilla Ubud\n\nI dream of Bali, and now, this hotel. Rooms look divine, as does the serene pool nestled amid lush greenery. While tourism has saturated Bali with overpriced luxury properties, this tranquil space channels Bali pre-Eat Pray Love.\n\nMathew on Trip Advisor agrees. \u201cWow wow wow. That\u2019s all I can say. Well not actually \u2026 I can\u2019t recommend this hotel more highly. The location is great for fabulous local restaurants, and the staff were so welcoming and knowledgeable \u2026 It was like a home away from home. The gardens were immaculate and quiet, but near enough action when we needed it \u2026 Sapodilla will have a special place in my memories.\u201d\n\nAkara Hotel, Bangkok, $91\n\ncaption This five-star jewel would easily cost hundreds anywhere else. source Akara Hotel\n\nBangkok is a cosmopolitan wonder, filled with vibrant food, color, and culture. Five-star hotels also regularly come in under $100 a night. This favorite ranks in the top 10 of all hotels in Bangkok on Trip Advisor. Elegant yet modern, rooms are gleaming white and feel ultra indulgent. Writes Mark L., \u201cReally loved our time in Akara hotel, felt like a celebrity for the duration of our stay, all the staff were so polite and mannerly and couldn\u2019t do enough for us. The hotel food was some of the best we\u2019ve had in Thailand.\u201d\n\nThe Roxbury, Contemporary Catskill Lodging, Roxbury, $99\n\ncaption We\u2019ll take the Austin Powers themed room, please. source Trip Advisor\n\nForget the Catskill lodges your grandparents dragged you to for family reunions (oh, just me?), The Roxbury is more than worth the schlep. Unlike dated B&Bs nearby, the Roxbury is whimsically over the top with eclectic design and funky themed rooms. It has several hundred five-star reviews praising its \u201cfun, quirky\u201d atmosphere.\n\nHotel Leyenda, Costa Rica, $96\n\ncaption This family-owned hotel looks as idyllic as its beautiful setting. source Booking.com\n\nThis small hotel in Playa Carrillo channels Costa Rica\u2019s signature Pura Vida vibes with a friendly, laid-back feel. The architecture has Mediterranean touches, and guests enjoys perks like breakfast included and beach shuttles. As one Trip Advisor traveler notes, the hotel surpasses all others with its customer service: \u201cYou feel like family.\u201d\n\nThe Lafayette Hotel, New Orleans, $95\n\ncaption The perfect retreat from NoLa\u2019s unstoppable buzz. source The Lafayette Hotel\n\nGot beignets on the brain? Me too, which is why I\u2019ve calculated that The Lafayette Hotel in New Orleans is not only classic and tasteful, but just a 20 minute walk, or quick drive, to Caf\u00e9 Du Monde\u2019s glorious plates of powdered sugar and fried dough. Starting at $87 a night and with four stars, it\u2019s easy to see why another traveler called it a \u201clovely hotel and the only place I stay at when I\u2019m in New Orleans.\u201d\n\nLas Palmas Maya, Tulum, $39\n\ncaption One night here costs about the price of breakfast at an overpriced property down the street. source Las Palmas Maya\n\nBefore Tulum became an influencer\u2019s playground, it was a low-key beachside escape that favored connecting with nature over staging the perfect selfie. Las Palmas Maya honors those idyllic roots, with a treehouse-like abode ensconced in the jungle, across the street from fresh surf. Rooms are bare bones and simple, but starting at $39 a night, that\u2019s the true Tulum.\n\nHotel Boutique Raco de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, $54\n\ncaption A boutique gem with a strong neighborhood feel. source Trip Advisor\n\nI once stayed at this tiny boutique hotel with an ex-boyfriend. The relationship was a bust, but my memories of the adorable property remain. The quaint, peaceful space is wrapped around a charming inner courtyard, with well-kept rooms steeped in character. It\u2019s a bit removed from the city center, but feels more authentic this way, like you\u2019ve stumbled onto a wonderful local secret.", "description": "Business Insider - A great hotel doesn\u2019t have to cost a fortune; it can even come in under $100.
