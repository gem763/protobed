RNC Rakes in Record $27.3 Million in September", "language": "en", "text": "The Republican National Committee (RNC) took in a record $27.3 million in September as House Democrats began their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to Fox News.\n\nThe RNC\u2019s fundraising haul in September is the highest amount for an \u201coff-cycle month\u201d ever raised by the GOP and Democrat National Committee (DNC), notes the news outlet. The RNC, which had $59.2 million in cash on hand last month, has more than doubled the DNC fundraising in the current cycle, the political committee said.\n\n\u201cWhile Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month\u2014the highest ever off-cycle\u2014to show for it,\u201d RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to Fox News. \u201cVoters are tired of Democrats\u2019 petty politics and baseless witch hunts, and their shameful attacks have only energized our grassroots army and allowed us to lay the groundwork for Republicans to take back the House, expand our majority in the Senate and re-elect President Trump in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe report follows a joint announcement by President Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign and the RNC in which they said a whopping combined $125.7 million was raised in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nThe RNC will use some of the money raised to fund \u201cStop the Madness,\u201d an anti-impeachment ad campaign designed to target vulnerable House Democrats running in moderate districts where voters are lukewarm to the idea of ousting the president.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to cause chaos,\u201d Rick Gorka, an RNC spokesperson, told Fox News. \u201cThis is a poison pill. When you couple the impeachment process with the socialist policies being espoused by 2020 Democrats, it\u2019s going to sink their chances at the ballot box, especially with those crucial swing voters and independents across the country.\u201d", "description": "The RNC reportedly took in a record $27.3 million in September as Democrats race to complete an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Ronna-McDaniel-Trump-crowd-background-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
