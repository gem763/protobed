They're not trophies on a cabinet table. They're actually an indication of strong budget management, and helping to build the resilience in the Australian economy so you can weather those economic shocks,'' he said.\n\n\"I mean, if Peter Costello and John Howard hadn't paid back Labor's debt, could you imagine the trouble that Labor would have had, more so than they even did, through that GFC?\n\n\"The fact that the Coalition left government under Howard and Costello with zero government debt, money in the bank and budget surpluses, gave Labor that fiscal flexibility to spend through that cycle when the shock hit.\n\n\"A strong budget position is not mutually exclusive from having a strong economy.\"\n\nOvernight, the IMF slashed Australia's economic growth forecast to just 1.7 per cent and advised world governments to unleash a spending stimulus.\n\nThe IMF's World Economic Outlook warned of a synchronised global slowdown to the weakest pace since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, as the world economy is pummelled by the US-China trade war that is inflicting a \"sharp deterioration\" in global manufacturing and trade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday the IMF downgraded Australia's forecasts, slicing 0.4 of a percentage point off growth for 2019 and cutting the 2020 expected recovery rate by 0.5 of a percentage point to a below-average 2.3 per cent.\n\nShadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the government could no longer wait until next year's May budget to respond.\n\n\"The government needs to bring forward a plan to deal with an economy which is floundering on its watch. That could be any or all of an increase to Newstart, they could bring forward some of their tax cuts, they could bring forward some infrastructure investment,'' he said.\n\n\"They don't have a wages policy, they don't have a settled energy policy. They need a tax break for business investment to deal with the extraordinarily weak business investment in the economy.\"\n\nMr Frydenberg has promised tax breaks for business investment but not until the May budget.\n\nMr Chalmers said he was not asking for government to blow the budget.\n\n\"We're not calling on the Government to throw the kitchen sink at these issues; we're calling for the Government to come up with a plan to do something about an economy that's floundering badly on the Liberal Party's watch.\n\n\"It is long past time for the Government to stop pretending that sitting on their hands, hoping for the best and crossing their fingers will do anything to turn this floundering economy around.\"", "description": "The Morrison government is rebuffing calls for extra stimulus after forecasts by the IMF sparked fresh calls for new spending.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5277%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_719%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/287328096fd5ccaeb0c857b506724efbc0066b78", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
