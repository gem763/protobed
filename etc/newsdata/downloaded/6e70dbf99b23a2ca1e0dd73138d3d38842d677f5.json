Don\u2019t kid yourselves,\u201d Trump said, claiming about the Democrats, \u201cI really don\u2019t believe anymore that they love our country.\u201d\n\nThe comments come as Democrats continue their quickly unfolding inquiry, deposing witness after witness as they build their case. But Trump and his campaign have tried to turn the inquiry into a rallying call for his supporters, accusing Democrats of using the Constitutional process to try to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming after and fighting you and we never lose,\u201d Trump said, predicting the 2020 election will be \u201ca landslide\u201d for Republicans, despite polling showing him lagging behind.\n\nTrump\u2019s day included a tour of a new Louis Vuitton MC, -0.89% leather workshop in north central Texas and a fundraiser in Fort Worth that, combined with a pre-rally reception in Dallas, brought in $5.5 million, according to the Republican National Committee.\n\nTexas is a crucial state for Republicans, both in terms of money and votes.\n\nTrump carried the GOP stronghold and its 38 Electoral College votes by 9 points in 2016. But Democrats have pointed to demographic changes \u2014 as well as the fact that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz won reelection by less than 3 points last year \u2014 as evidence that the second-most-populous state could soon be in play.\n\nAs he campaigns for a second term, Trump\u2019s team has tried to focus attention on economic gains over the last three years, including the low unemployment rate. Pressing that message, Trump cut the ribbon at a new production facility for the luxury brand Louis Vuitton in Alvarado with his elder daughter, Ivanka.\n\nTrump joked that the company, which is known for its logoed handbags and luggage, has cost him \u201ca lot of money over the years.\u201d His wife, first lady Melania Trump, has repeatedly been spotted traveling with the brand.\n\n\u201cThis workshop will soon employ 500 of the most highly skilled workers anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNo one can match the precision and perfection of an American artisan.\u201d\n\nThe Texas visit comes at a treacherous time for Trump, whose dealings with the president of Ukraine are under fire. While Republicans have largely defended Trump, they sounded alarms over his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeast Syria \u2014 a move that paved the way for Turkey to invade and assault the Kurds, who\u2019d fought alongside the U.S. in its campaign against Islamic State militants.\n\nUpon landing in Texas on Thursday, Trump credited his threat of sanctions on Turkey and the violence that has taken place for the announcement of a cease-fire, though critics say the deal largely solidifies Turkey\u2019s position and aims. Still, Trump described the cease-fire as an \u201cincredible outcome\u201d that could not have occurred \u201cunless you went somewhat unconventional.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign and the RNC have been raking in record money, raising $125 million in the third quarter of 2019 and smashing the just over $70 million former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised in the third quarter of 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s would-be challengers are deep in an increasingly contentious race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nOne of those candidates, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, was holding a counter-rally protesting Trump\u2019s appearance in nearby Grand Prairie Thursday evening. He did the same when Trump held a rally in El Paso in February and drew a substantial crowd, but his standing in the race has since fallen.\n\nStill, Trump make sure to call him out, pointing to his plan to confiscate assault-style rifles and his support for rescinding the tax-exempt status for churches and charities that are anti-LGBTQ.\n\n\u201cNo religion and no guns. I think that\u2019s not good,\u201d Trump said.", "description": "President Donald Trump unleashed a scathing screed against Democrats at a rally in Texas Thursday, bashing his opponents as \u201ccrazy\u201d as they push forward on...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT574_19trum_ZG_20191017215827.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
