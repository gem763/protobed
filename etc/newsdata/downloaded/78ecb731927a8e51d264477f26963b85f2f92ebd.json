That bout's last-minute demise meant it was the second attempted title defence on home soil to fall through for Whittaker, who will be desperate to make it into (and out of) the Octagon in one piece,\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know:\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

REUTERS\n\nWhen is UFC 243?\n\nThe preliminary card starts at 12am (BST), followed by the main card at 3am (BST), with the main event fight expected to begin at around 5:30am.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nThe event will be shown live on BT Sport 1, the BT Sport App and BTSport.com for subscribers.\n\nPrediction\n\nWhittaker and Adesanya are among the most versatile and dangerous combatants in MMA, and the odds show that calling this one is like flipping a coin. The tall, rangy Adesanya is in the form of his life, having somehow fought and won six times in just over a year since joining the UFC's roster, and Whittaker\u2019s last bout \u2013 16 months ago \u2013 saw the Aussie sustain a lot of damage in his second consecutive win against middleweight monster Yoel Romero of Cuba.\n\nThat said, Gastelum \u2013 despite a significant height and reach disadvantage \u2013 was able to land regularly and heavily on Adesanya earlier this year, and should have knocked out \u2018The Last Stylebender\u2019.\n\nWhittaker still has a shorter reach and height than his challenger on Sunday, but not as noticeably as with Gastelum. \u2018The Reaper\u2019 is also faster and more well-rounded than Gastelum. Given Gastelum damaged \u2018Stylebender\u2019 as much as he did in April, the experienced Whittaker should be able to inflict enough of an assault on Adesanya to leave Marvel Stadium with the belt still around his waist.\n\nExpect a war, either way.\n\nFull card\n\nRobert Whittaker (c) vs. Israel Adesanya (ic) \u2013 middleweight championship\n\nAl Iaquinta vs. Dan Hooker\n\nTai Tuivasa vs. Serghei Spivac\n\nLuke Jumeau vs. Dhiego Lima\n\nJustin Tafa vs. Yorgan De Castro\n\nPrelims\n\nJake Matthews vs. Rostam Akman\n\nCallan Potter vs. Maki Pitolo\n\nMegan Anderson vs. Zarah Fairn Dos Santos\n\nBrad Riddell vs. Jamie Mullarkey\n\nNadia Kassem vs. Ji Yeon Kim\n\nKhalid Taha vs Bruno Silva\n\nOdds\n\nWhittaker 5/6\n\nAdesanya 5/6", "description": "The UFC heads to Australia this Sunday as Melbourne's Marvel Stadium plays host to\u00a0UFC 243.
