It won't be easy", "language": "en", "text": "New York (CNN Business) Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic have raised alarms about whether Facebook's cryptocurrency project, Libra , could upend the global financial system and make the company even more powerful.\n\nOn Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attempt to defend his company's plans for Libra while testifying on Capitol Hill before the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nAt the hearing, Zuckerberg is expected to pitch Libra as a prime example of American innovation that can help \"extend\" the country's \"financial leadership\" and \"democratic values.\" But he will also acknowledge long-simmering concerns aboutitself, after a long list of privacy scandals as well as mounting antitrust scrutiny\n\n\"I believe this is something that needs to get built, but I understand we're not the ideal messenger right now,\" Zuckerberg is expected to say, according to his prepared testimony released ahead of the hearing. \"We've faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I'm sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward. But there's a reason we care about this. Facebook is about putting power in people's hands.\"\n\nThe stakes are high for Zuckerberg's performance on Wednesday.Many lawmakers have not ruled out the possibility that they could try to block Libra altogether if they are not satisfied by Zuckerberg's responses. David Marcus, the Facebook exec who headed up the Libra effort and now runs the company's subsidiary developing services for users to save and spend Libra, testified before Congress in July, but many lawmakers weren't entirely satisfied with what they heard.\n\nas lawmakers were \"It is imperative that we get Mr. Zuckerberg in before the committee,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat, said in an interview with reportersas lawmakers were urging Zuckerberg to testify . \"This is his brainchild, his company, he's the one to have the answers to many of the questions we also raised with Mr. Marcus. Some of the questions that he didn't answer or didn't answer fully, I think Mr. Zuckerberg is the one to address those.\"\n\nGarcia added: \"Until they answer our questions, we cannot allow this to go forward.\"\n\nZuckerberg's testimony comes days after several of the project's early partners jumped ship, potentially making it harder for Libra to gain regulatory approval.\n\nMastercard MA Visa V PayPal PYPL Fitch Ratings analysts said in a recent statement thatandbowing out of the Libra governance organization, which they did along with fellow payments companies , Stripe and Mercado Pago, deprives Libra of \"payment specialists with deep regulatory and antitrust experience.\" Just one payments company remains in the organization: Dutch firm PayU.\n\nFacebook and Libra's other backers say they want to work with regulators, and will wait for regulatory approval in order to launch. In the meantime, the group has forged ahead with setting up the early governance structure and articles of association for the Libra Association, which will manage the digital currency. They say Libra could revolutionize the global payments system, making it easier to send money around the world and potentially benefiting the underbanked.\n\n\"People pay far too high a cost \u2014 and have to wait far too long \u2014 to send money home to their families abroad. The current system is failing them,\" Zuckerberg said in his prepared testimony.\n\nhas one seat of five on the board. But Facebook's involvement \u2014 and Libra's potential access to its more than 2 billion users \u2014 nonetheless helped make Libra a bigger concern for regulators. The digital currency will be managed by an organization comprised of 21 companies, including Facebook. The social networking firmhas one seat of five on the board. But Facebook's involvement \u2014 and Libra's potential access to its more than 2 billion users \u2014 nonetheless helped make Libra a bigger concern for regulators.\n\nIn addition to acknowledging lawmakers' concerns with Facebook's track record, Zuckerberg also attempted to defuse fears about Libra's potential impact on existing currencies. Zuckerberg said in his prepared remarks that Libra \"is not an attempt to create a sovereign currency.\" He also noted that Libra will be backed \"mostly by dollars,\" referencing the Libra Reserve that will back the coin 1:1.\n\nThe anticipated makeup of the reserve, beyond Facebook's statements that it will be comprised of government-backed currencies and debt instruments, has been unclear, leading lawmakers to fear Libra could undermine central banks' ability to carry out monetary policy.\n\nThe hearing will also cover Facebook-related issues beyond Libra. Another piece of legislation to be proposed Wednesday would require Facebook and other internet platforms that profit from collecting and selling ads based on user data to regularly disclose to users what data is being collected and why, as well as spelling out the economic value of their data.", "description": "Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic have raised alarms about whether Facebook's cryptocurrency project, Libra, could upend the global financial system and make the company even more powerful.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191021170703-zuckerberg-1017-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
