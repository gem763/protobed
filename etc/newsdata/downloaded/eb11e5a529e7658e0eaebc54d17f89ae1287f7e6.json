For a time she was a goth manga warrior with long black hair, then a green-haired androgynous art angel, and a flame-haired punk princess. But with the release of her debut album Serotonin II today via Bayonet Records, yeule (real name Nat \u0106miel) has found a concrete visual representation of herself.\n\n\u201cThere was a period where I was literally like a chameleon. Every time I met a friend who I haven\u2019t seen in two weeks, I\u2019d have different colored hair and a different style and I\u2019d just look completely different. Or when I\u2019d go back home to Singapore to visit my family, they\u2019d be like woah, what the fuck!\u201d \u0106miel says, laughing on the phone from London, where she\u2019s lived for the last four years. \u201cWith this album, I think I latched onto this particular look for yeule that\u2019s more solidified, because of my own realizations about self-discovery and expression. It\u2019s good to have some grounding.\u201d\n\nThat grounding comes via a look that\u2019s a softer, more romantic rendering of her typical gothic style. She\u2019s still chameleonic, but the bruised, demonic makeup contouring her face is alternated with more muted tones. This sartorial evolution coincides with a development in her music. Serotonin II finds \u0106miel\u2019s celestial electronica, shoegaze, and dream pop more crystallized.\n\nAfter three EPs and many years, she\u2019s expanded her heavenly video game-influenced sound to cinematic proportions. As if going from dial-up to high-speed internet, her pop melodies develop more quickly and strike with more immediacy. The tender songs on Serotonin II call to mind The Postal Service and My Bloody Valentine but also sound like the musings of a benevolent creature that\u2019s just landed from another galaxy. Just like her evolving visual style, \u0106miel\u2019s new songs are breathtakingly beautiful, but any overtly delicate moments are shattered by sudden glitches or distortion.\n\nPhoto by Neil Krug.\n\n\u0106miel\u2019s complex sound and style derives from growing up on the internet. The name yeule is inspired by the Final Fantasy XIII-2 character Paddra Nsu-Yeul, who is \u201cburdened with the power of prophecy\u201d and dies every time she has a vision of the future. \u201cA lot of my interests come from identity and recognition of the self, because of cyberspace and how it affects youth, particularly Generation Z,\u201d she says. Having grown up as an avid gamer and isolated music fan in Singapore, \u0106miel found solace in creating and recreating herself via the internet. This allowed her to form her identity and gave her the courage to create her art. But despite the growth it\u2019s afforded her, \u0106miel is wary of the internet and how we use it to shape our identities.\n\n\u201cWhen you use the internet as a form of escapism or glorify the internet [as a place] where you can truly be yourself, you\u2019re creating this kind of self-fulfilling vortex of another reality. This was the case for me, in high school, because I didn\u2019t have many friends. All of my friends were online, and I felt like I had true friends online, especially in gaming. When you build a team and you have a group that you come to online, it\u2019s like a family,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI put the internet on a pedestal, because it was my only form of escape. Growing up and out of teenage years, I was really confused when I started to have real friends and found the beauty in connecting with others in real life. I only realized how much it matters when I experienced it IRL. So now I\u2019m at this point where I\u2019m kind of detaching myself from the internet, because I want to feel real. Even though I felt real on the internet, I want to feel real without it.\u201d\n\nWe often talk about how we deceive others online, but self-deception is equally present and problematic. As \u0106miel has built her personas, she\u2019s had to remain aware of this, and keep one foot in the physical world. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like breaking an addiction!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI sound crazy, but it\u2019s like breaking an addiction to a desire for a safe space, or what you thought was a safe space, you know?\u201d\n\nFortunately, she\u2019s recently found herself in a physical safe space as part of a community of electronic artists. Last week she travelled to Los Angeles to perform at 100% ElectroniCON 2, a festival organized by vaporwave futurist George Clanton. \u201cI think that what George Clanton is doing is pretty OG,\u201d she says, \u201cconsidering the rise of a musical subculture like vaporwave, stemming from the internet and meme culture as well, and manifesting it in reality. It takes a lot of strength and I think that\u2019s really sick.\u201d\n\nThe festival is gaining traction as a positive incarnation of a scene that exists largely online, which feels like a rare blessing, given how much deception is rife on the internet. Yeule\u2019s most recent single, \u201cPoison Arrow,\u201d also explores deception, albeit in a different scenario. In the video, which was shot in Warsaw, \u0106miel embodies a cupid character who suffocates an angelic boy with unrequited desire. It\u2019s a reminder how, just as we can deceive ourselves by constructing alternate realities and personas online, we can also deceive ourselves in love and romance.\n\n\u0106miel based her character in the video on one of her personas, called Penelope. \u201cI asked Toby [Buchan, the director], \u2018Is it weird that I have this other persona, and when I am Penelope I behave and act differently?\u2019\u201d She says Penelope\u2019s \u201cpsychotic\u201d nature made her an ideal choice for \u201crepresenting this idea of the poison arrow.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know whether she shot the right love arrow, or whether she shot another arrow that was meant for another purpose, or for someone else,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always questioned this idea \u2014 am I really giving my purest love to somebody, or am I accidentally poisoning them by giving them too much of what I think is love?\u201d\n\nExploring ideas like this through her personas has afforded \u0106miel some distance with which to process her own painful encounters. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that online love is bad,\u201d she says, \u201cBut to be with somebody online and never meet them in real life \u2014 that\u2019s something different. And I\u2019ve personally experienced that before. I think it becomes really confusing when the other person treats it as an online relationship, and you treat it as a real one. You question your self-worth, your trust, your idea of loyalty \u2014 you question a lot of things.\u201d\n\nThe positive in all of this is that, as \u0106miel has solidified her own identity via the internet, she\u2019s also gained a supportive community around her that extends into the real world. At her record release show in London on November 1, she plans to give away friendship bracelets with her album. \u201cSo if you get the vinyl, you get a friendship bracelet, and I have one too, so we\u2019ll all be friends.\u201d\n\n\n\nYeule\u2019s album Serotonin II is out now via Bayonet Records\n\n", "description": "Artist Nat \u0106miel has expanded her heavenly video game-influenced sound to cinematic proportions on 'Serotonin II.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db2f8d37516d20092711e99/lede/1572011514223-7-Yeule-Neil-Krug-Serotonin-II-Optimized.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.562xh;0xw,0.0167xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
