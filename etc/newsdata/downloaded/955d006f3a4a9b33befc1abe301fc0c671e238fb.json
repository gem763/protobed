Ed Perlmutter who led the effort.\n\nThe bill now heads to the Republican-controlled Senate for a much less certain future.\n\nFor the time being, however, industry advocates were quick to call any move to embrace marijuana at a national level a major win.\n\nKevin Murphy, CEO of the nation\u2019s most widespread marijuana company in Acreage Holdings (ACRGF), told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM that the House passing the SAFE Banking Act was no doubt a \u201cbig day in history going forward with cannabis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because it\u2019s the first meaningful step in recognizing the fastest growing industry in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate business, it employs tens of thousands, and think about the hypocrisy we\u2019ve lived with in this space \u2014 the IRS is willing to collect your taxes\u2026 but they\u2019re not really willing to have banks bank the industry.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of fellow multi-state cannabis company Curaleaf (CRLF), Joe Lusardi, echoed that sentiment late Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIf ratified, the bill will increase the safety of our operations for our patients, customers and employees by reducing the reliance on cash and promoting transparency,\u201d Lusardi said in a statement.\n\nThat said, not all marijuana progressives are necessarily in favor of the bill, which is limited in scope to only affect banking laws. Democratic presidential candidates that have made marijuana reform a large part of their platform, like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, have advocated for legislation that would go further to also add in elements of criminal justice reform related to marijuana.\n\nWHITE BOARDS: Despite the fact that marijuana usage rates among whites and non-whites in the U.S. are mostly similar, and the fact that communities of color face a higher number of marijuana arrests, a Yahoo Finance analysis shows the boards of the top marijuana companies are still disproportionately made up of white men. More\n\n\n\n\n\nA bill proposed by Harris and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler known as the MORE Act would not only legalize marijuana at a federal level, but also set aside tax revenue to establish an opportunity trust fund meant to assist socially disadvantaged business owners and minimize barriers to entry for minority cannabis entrepreneurs.\n\nFor now, however, cannabis businesses looking for financial services will take the victory.\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
