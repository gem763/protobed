And in doing so, the normally tough-as-nails broadcaster cracked.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister today on radio with me has disappointed millions of Australians,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cI begged him to provide fodder, water and freight so farmers wouldn\u2019t have to send their breeding stock to slaughter. He just didn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nJones spoke about a call from a farmer he received this morning, just 10 minutes after his interview with Mr Morrison, in which the man began to cry about having to sell off his stock.\n\nJones then addressed a listener named Mary, who had contacted him and urged him to keep up the pressure on political figures.\n\n\u201cWe will fight because I have been exactly where the people of Bourke are,\u201d he said. \u201cMy old man would be ashamed of me if I didn\u2019t fight. I can\u2019t speak for Canberra \u2026\u201d\n\nA choked-up Jones then struggled to speak, putting his hands up and asking to \u201ctake a break\u201d, before a series of ads played.\n\n\u201cLook, sorry about that,\u201d he said when the show returned.\n\nRELATED: The towns forced to pay $1 million a month just to stay alive as drought crisis worsens\n\nScott Morrison in tense interview with Alan Jones following emotional phone call from farmer Radio host Alan Jones confronted the Prime Minister with a heartbreaking phone call from a listener this morning \u2014 then absolutely grilled him.\n\nJones was fierce in his criticism of the Coalition\u2019s slow response to drought relief, saying that a major investment for a new dam in New South Wales was welcome, but \u201cit is the here and now that has to be addressed\u201d.\n\nThe Sky News show played the audio of a series of calls from 2GB listeners today slamming Mr Morrison\u2019s remarks, describing him as out-of-touch.\n\nJones also read out messages sent in to his program.\n\n\u201cThey have never been where we have been,\u201d Jones said, referring to politicians.\n\nDespite the crisis facing many farming communities, he said \u201cin Question Time today, it was as if the drought didn\u2019t exist\u201d.\n\nAnd then Jones delivered a stark warning for the PM.\n\n\u201cThe Morrison government tonight has a massive political crisis on its hands. It can be solved, but it\u2019d want to be solved in a hurry otherwise the political fallout will be terminal.\u201d\n\nIf the fury of listeners on 2GB is anything to go by, Jones could be right.\n\nThe PM went on the radio to talk about the drought. Safe to say people didn't like what they heard. pic.twitter.com/i5ZycPmjns \u2014 Anthony Albanese (@AlboMP) October 15, 2019\n\nHe said the switchboard was \u201con fire\u201d after Mr Morrison\u2019s appearance today, with outraged farmers keen to share their fury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just devastated. This guy\u2019s a waste of space. I just can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Jim said.\n\nCaller Robert added: \u201cMy blood\u2019s boiling after hearing that. I\u2019ll describe it, right. Complete failure as a Prime Minister. He\u2019s arrogant. They\u2019ve been conning the public after the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a former one-eyed Liberal, I felt like putting my fist through the radio listening to Scott Morrison this morning,\u201d Anna added.\n\nThose are just a selection of the angry and emotional calls 2GB received.\n\nRELATED: The Australian towns facing a looming \u2018day zero\u2019 crisis\n\nMr Morrison defended his government\u2019s policies during the interview, highlighting more than $300 million it has made available to help struggling farmers.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is exactly what I told the Australian people I was going to do. Whether it\u2019s on energy, on water, our support for farmers in the drought, and we just finished the most recent financial year, where we put an additional $318.5 million in additional support to farmers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWherever you look at it, it\u2019s meeting the immediate needs of farmers, it\u2019s about meeting the needs in communities that are affected by the drought, and then it\u2019s about investing in the water infrastructure.\u201d\n\nHe did, however, admit there were limits to the government\u2019s power.\n\n\u201cThe government, whether it\u2019s state, federal or anyone else, we can do a lot of things to try and help people get through this. But the government can\u2019t make it rain, and it can\u2019t make life as it was before the drought,\u201d he said.", "description": "An emotional Alan Jones has broken down in tears on his television show describing the horrific plight of drought-stricken farmers and renewing his criticism of Prime Minister Scott Morrison.", "authors": ["Shannon Molloy"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/eeecbc4984691dbc5d05fa30b5dc728b?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
