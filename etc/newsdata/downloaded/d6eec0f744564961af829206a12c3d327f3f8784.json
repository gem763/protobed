(Getty Images)\n\nTo understand why the Baltimore Ravens made the Marcus Peters trade, watch the highlights from their 23-17 win over the winless Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.\n\nIn fact, the first of the \u201cThings I Noticed\u201d while reviewing the Week 6 games was the way the Bengals seemed to pick on any Ravens cornerback not named Marlon Humphrey.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSeriously.\n\n(Yahoo Sports)\n\nWhile Humphrey, the Ravens\u2019 underrated third-year corner, took care of business Sunday, the trio of Maurice Canady, Brandon Carr and to a lesser extent, Justin Bethel, seemed to be on the receiving end of Bengals coach Zac Taylor\u2019s game plan.\n\nCanady, in particular, surrendered 10 catches for 109 yards on 14 tackles, according to Pro Football Focus, many of them against the Bengals\u2019 Auden Tate, a massive 6-foot-5, 228-pound seventh-round pick from 2018 who caught only five of his 12 targets Sunday but made them count, racking up 91 yards on the day.\n\nMany of them were of the contested variety:\n\nSo yes, this trade could be a home run for the Ravens, who surrendered only a fifth-round pick and backup linebacker Kenny Young for a corner who can help them now.\n\nPeters is a fearless zone corner with good ball skills and advanced football IQ that allows him to routinely gamble on routes and make plays on the ball:\n\nAnd while he needs to be protected with safety help \u2014 he\u2019s no burner \u2014 when you consider that the Ravens run a healthy amount of zone (unlike the Rams, who prefer man but used more zone to accommodate Peters) it\u2019s a good fit.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cTo me, he\u2019s one of the top corners in the league,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Wednesday. \u201cHe plays the way we play. When I say that, you know the coverages we play. You watch us every day. So, he fits in really well that way and gives us another weapon back there so we can do the things we want to do, defensively. That\u2019s what I\u2019m excited about.\u201d\n\nPeters also brings discernible negatives to the table, but they\u2019ll likely be negated due to the situation he now finds himself in. While he is not shy about sharing his opinion about the scheme or coaching \u2014 something that can be exacerbated by losing because he\u2019s so competitive \u2014 the Ravens, at 4-2, are the early favorites to win the AFC North, so that risk should be mitigated.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Peters, 26, is also in a contract year, which means the Ravens could dangle the possibility of a new contract this offseason in front of him as an additional motivator, even if they have no intention of fulfilling it.\n\nSafety Earl Thomas, a respected, strong and accomplished locker room voice, could help indoctrinate Peters into the Ravens\u2019 culture. Peters cares about football and winning, a trait they both share, and Peters will get a chance to see how much the game matters to Thomas this weekend, when the Ravens travel to Seattle to face Thomas\u2019 old team, the Seahawks.\n\nI\u2019d bet on the super-intense Thomas \u2014 who flipped the Seahawks\u2019 sideline the bird while being wheeled off the field after a season-ending injury last October \u2014 recording an interception, forced fumble or fumble recovery this weekend, just like I\u2019d bet on Peters doing the same when the Ravens travel to Los Angeles to face Peters\u2019 former team, the Rams, on Nov. 25.\n\nSpeaking of the Rams ...\n\nJalen Ramsey doesn\u2019t fix Rams\u2019 primary problem\n\nPlease check this out in the finely made video above \u2014 once again produced by my main man Ron Schiltz \u2014 but the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 decision to ship Peters out to clear room for Ramsey won\u2019t necessarily cure their Super Bowl hangover.\n\nAfter racing out to a 3-0 start, the Rams have lost three games in a row, which includes a ridiculous shootout loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday in which the Rams, quite plainly, got their butts kicked on the offensive line.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong: I like the trade for the Rams \u2026 in a vacuum. Any time a team can acquire an All-Pro 25-year-old corner with elite physical traits and an aggressive demeanor, it has to do it \u2014 even if it\u2019s going to cost a boatload of money and premium draft picks.\n\nBut the Rams\u2019 offensive line is beat up, and the 49ers exposed some physical limitations they have up front Sunday. Los Angeles couldn\u2019t run the ball the same after their opening drive, and when the Rams\u2019 run game is middling, the play-action is less effective for quarterback Jared Goff, who then has to sling it as a drop-back passer. The New England Patriots proved in last season\u2019s Super Bowl that is the exact thing an opponent wants Goff to do.\n\nThe Rams should get back on the winning track soon as they face two of the NFL\u2019s worst pass defenses in the Falcons and Bengals in the coming weeks, but we\u2019ll see what they\u2019re really made of in Weeks 10 and 11 against the Steelers and Bears, who rank third and ninth in the NFL in sacks, respectively.\n\nHere\u2019s how you know Sam Darnold is good\n\nLet\u2019s go beyond the stats in his killer performance against the Dallas Cowboys in the New York Jets\u2019 24-22 win on Sunday.\n\nOh, those were nice \u2014 Darnold was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week after completing 23 of 32 passes for 338 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in the Jets\u2019 shocking win \u2014 but it was the way he did it.\n\nDarnold not only made some nice plays in the pocket \u2014 throwing some outright dimes, which you\u2019ll see in the highlights below \u2014 he also showed creativity by avoiding the rush, keeping his eyes downfield and making the defense pay:\n\nHere\u2019s another feather in the cap of the Darnold Truthers: if you believe the No. 1 way to evaluate any quarterback is to judge whether he elevates his teammates\u2019 play, then Darnold absolutely passes that test.\n\nThe Jets looked lost and abysmal offensively while he sat out for a month with mono \u2014 they went 0-3 and converted just five of 40 third downs during that span \u2014 but the moment he returned, they immediately became so competent they massacred Vegas in the process.\n\nOf course, Monday\u2019s showdown against the New England Patriots, the undefeated Evil Empire of the NFL, will present a much greater challenge for Darnold and the Jets.\n\nWhile the Cowboys\u2019 defense ranks a disappointing 25th in DVOA, the Patriots \u2014 who rank first \u2014 boast a strong run defense and pass defense guided by the NFL\u2019s best defensive mind in coach Bill Belichick.\n\nIf Darnold can still move the ball this weekend behind one of the NFL\u2019s worst offensive lines and a league-average supporting cast, you can consider the NFL on notice.\n\nWhile other quarterbacks in the 2018 NFL draft class like Baker Mayfield, Lamar Jackson and even Josh Allen have gotten more hype over the past 18 months, the super-competitive Darnold remains a high-ceiling quarterback whose development bears watching.\n\nCould Aaron Rodgers have a new favorite target?\n\nAnytime a young receiver is good enough to get the Green Bay Packers\u2019 notoriously picky Aaron Rodgers to suggest more playing time, he is someone you should pay attention to.\n\nAnd when you throw in the fact that Allen Lazard \u2014 a 23-year-old who went undrafted in 2018 \u2014 delivered down the stretch in the Packers\u2019 narrow 23-22 win over Detroit after Rodgers advocated for him, well, I think we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of him in the future.\n\nLazard caught four of five targets for 65 yards and a touchdown against the Lions, and he looked big, strong and reliable while doing it, using his 10-inch hands to pluck the ball out of the air and his size (6-5, 227 pounds) to run hard after the catch:\n\nLazard, a former top-50 player nationally as a prep senior, was productive at Iowa State but he was dinged during the pre-draft process for a perceived lack of on-field explosiveness, despite measuring out as an above-average tester during drills.\n\nIf he has really earned Rodgers\u2019 trust \u2014 and two of the banged-up receivers ahead of him, Davante Adams and Geronimo Allison, remain out \u2014 don\u2019t be surprised to see Lazard surprise in a tasty matchup against a vulnerable Oakland Raiders secondary.\n\nYou remind me of \u2026\n\nCharles Woodson will soon be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame as he\u2019s up for election in 2021. I\u2019m not about to compare Denver Broncos safety Kareem Jackson to him in every sense, however, the way Jackson \u2014 a 31-year-old former cornerback who moved to safety this year \u2014 moves and plays at his new position, he reminds me a little bit of how Woodson looked during the twilight of his career.\n\nWoodson, who also moved to safety in his 30s, continued to impact the game beyond his prime as a lithe playmaker. Jackson made a few plays in the Broncos\u2019 16-0 shutout of Tennessee on Sunday that reminded me of some of the things Twilight Years Woodson used to do:\n\nJackson seems to be aging gracefully like Woodson did. He\u2019s on pace to finish with a solid statline of 72 tackles, 11 passes defended, three forced fumbles and three interceptions this year. He regularly seems to make plays that help the Broncos win games.\n\nJackson has never made a Pro Bowl, but if he keeps playing like this, that might change this season.\n\nKeith Jackson Call of the Week\n\nWhen it comes to NFL play-by-play announcers, CBS\u2019s Kevin Harlan is fantastic. He\u2019s so good that he can make a *nice* 23-yard catch-and-run sound much more exciting than that:\n\nKeep it up, Kev.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "This trade could be a home run for Baltimore, particularly with Earl Thomas serving as a leader.", "authors": ["Terez Paylor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XhkkYVFjg1nP3mZgTWEX8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTQuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1ph6Hqiliv8bLSFtwmFiHw--~B/aD0xNzI2O3c9MjU4NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/db153a80-f08c-11e9-bd77-17660ce790ee", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
