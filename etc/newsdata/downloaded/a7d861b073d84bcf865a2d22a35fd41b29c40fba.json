Officials have not yet released any additional information.\n\nRUSSIA NUCLEAR MISSILE EXPLOSION CAUSED 2 WORKERS TO DIE OF RADIATION SICKNESS, REPORT SAYS\n\nThe port city of Severodvinsk is located near the military shooting range in Nyonoksa, in the country's far northern Arkhangelsk region.\n\nOn Aug. 8, five nuclear workers were killed during a rocket engine test near the White Sea in an area considered part of the testing range. Russia's Defense Ministry initially said the blast killed two people and injured six, but the state-controlled nuclear agency, Rosatom, later disclosed that the explosion killed five of its workers and injured three others. Rosatom said the explosion occurred while engineers were testing \"a nuclear isotope power source\" for a rocket and were thrown into the sea by the explosion.\n\nA Russian newspaper later reported that two of the patients that were injured in the blast died from radiation sickness before they could be taken to Moscow for treatment.\n\nThe mysterious explosion was followed by a brief rise in radiation levels in nearby Severodvinsk, but the authorities insisted the recorded levels didn't pose any danger to local residents. Russia's state weather agency, Rosgidromet, said it believed radiation levels had risen up to 16 times after the accident when a cloud of radioactive gases drifted across the area in the wake of the blast.\n\nWeeks later, the weather agency said that radioactive isotopes were been discovered in test samples.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRussian officials' changing and contradictory accounts of the incident have drawn comparisons to Soviet attempts to cover up the 1986 explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the world's worst nuclear disaster.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry at first denied any radiation leak in the incident, even as authorities in nearby Severodvinsk reported a brief rise in radiation levels and advised residents to stay indoors and close the windows.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has praised the victims of the disaster, saying they were doing \"very important work for the nation's security,\" but kept mum on what type of weapon they were testing. U.S. defense officials and outside observers believe it was a missile Russia calls the 9M730 Burevestnik. The NATO alliance has designated it the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, which was first revealed by Putin in March 2018 along with other doomsday weapons.", "description": "Three U.S. diplomats were removed from a train and detained Monday near a mysterious military site in northwestern Russia where a deadly explosion and radiation leak took place, according to officials.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
