Super nervous. First time meeting my boyfriend\u2019s friends? I might need to hide in the bathroom for a bit.\n\nIt\u2019s something I\u2019m typically able to get over fairly quickly, yet it happens often.\n\nThis week Fast Company made a great suggestion on how to handle that anxiety a little better: reframe it in your mind as excitement.\n\nWhile technically you\u2019ll still be experiencing the same feelings, when you think of them as simply being excited about something then it will be a bit easier to manage than considering yourself anxious instead.\n\nIn general, we all consider excitement to be a positive feeling while anxiety is most often considered a negative one.\n\nWhen you lean into that feeling it can transform what would have potentially been a negative into a positive. Too much anxiety can cause your performance to suffer at work. By reframing it in your mind as excitement instead you can potentially turn that negative into a positive, and make the feeling one that works for you rather than against you.", "description": "Historically, I\u2019ve always been a slightly anxious person.", "authors": ["Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/dcdqi8h8riyf9usfnz4a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
