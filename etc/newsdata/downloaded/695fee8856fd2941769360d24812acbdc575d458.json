Ask the right questions.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Impeaching a U.S. president might not be the be-all-end-all for their career. We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nImpeachment is Congress' sacred constitutional duty. The only goal of these investigations should be to find the truth.\n\nIf there is one thing both Republicans and Democrats can agree on, it\u2019s that the Trump White House has an unfortunate tendency to lurch from one PR crisis to the next, leaving a trail of face-palming and despair in its wake, even among his supporters. Some of them are bizarre, like Sharpiegate. Others arguably represent more serious threats, like when he attacked then Attorney General Jeff Sessions for criminally prosecuting two Republican House members who otherwise would have had \u201ceasy wins.\u201d But all of these incidents shared a common trait: They were quickly pushed out of the headlines by the next one.\n\nThe whistleblower scandal that blew up last week is different. This one isn\u2019t going to disappear quite so easily. It\u2019s a serious and credible example of impeachable conduct and it needs to be thoroughly investigated.\n\nThis isn't just another scandal\n\nAnd there is a lot to investigate. What we know so far does look like an extremely serious abuse of power. If President Barack Obama had called up the governor of New York and pressured him to have his attorney general investigate Donald Trump, you can only imagine the reaction from Republicans \u2014 and everyone else, for that matter. That Trump is asking a foreign power to dig up dirt on a political opponent makes it worse, not better.\n\nAnd that leaves aside the question of whether the president withheld aid for Ukraine that had been appropriated by Congress in order to get them to comply with the president\u2019s wishes. Again, just imagine if President Obama had tried to coerce a governor to dig up dirt on one of his political opponents by threatening to hold up disaster relief funding.\n\nUkraine investigation: Donald Trump's defense only makes him look worse\n\nNonetheless, we should withhold judgment. Jurors are admonished not to form an opinion until all the evidence is in and that is exactly what everyone, Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, should do. This is no longer a political issue. These matters must be investigated and President Trump categorically refuses to comply with ordinary congressional oversight. That leaves the House no choice but to invoke impeachment, the most solemn power in the constitutional arsenal.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on Sept. 26, 2019.

The question is not whether Trump is a good president or whether you agree with his policies. Rather, the question is whether President Trump is a clear threat to American democracy and the rule of law. That is not a determination anyone can make until all the facts are in.\n\nPerhaps, ultimately, the president will be impeached. Perhaps he won\u2019t. But impeachment isn\u2019t just for presidents. Any civil officer of the United States can be impeached, including anyone who improperly attempted to prevent Congress from learning about this incident.\n\nThoroughly investigate every unknown detail\n\nThere are many questions for Congress to answer. Is this the complete record of the call? There is ample evidence that the \u201creadout\u201d of the call is incomplete. There may be even more disturbing information in the complete transcript. What other conversations did President Trump have with President Volodymyr Zelensky? What interactions did Rudy Giuliani have with Ukrainian officials? Did Attorney General William Barr \u2014 or any other members of the Trump administration \u2014 ever speak with Ukranian officials? Why was congressionally-appropriated aid for Ukraine held up while Trump was lobbying them to investigate his political enemies? What other pressures were placed on the Ukrainians?\n\nTrump's new impeachable offense: threatening the life of a CIA officer\n\nAccording to the complaint, there was a concerted effort to bury this incident even before the complaint was filed. What steps were taken and who ordered them? Was the president confronted about his behavior on the call and how did he react? Were any of the people responsible involved in the handling of the whistleblower complaint? If so, what steps were taken to address the obvious conflict of interest?\n\nThere are also questions that need to be answered about the handling of the complaint itself. When was Trump told about the existence of the complaint? Did he order the acting director of national intelligence to overrule the inspector general\u2019s determination that the complaint was a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d or otherwise attempt to prevent the complaint from being forwarded to Congress? What was Attorney General Barr\u2019s involvement?\n\nDuring these proceedings, the House must act with fairness and deliberation. But nor should it allow itself to be balked by an uncooperative president. When the House is involved in an impeachment investigation, there is no valid claim of executive privilege. Even making a such a claim can be an impeachable offense. One of the articles of impeachment passed against Richard Nixon was for exactly this kind of behavior. President Trump should remember that, regardless of whether or not he thinks he has done anything wrong, it\u2019s always the coverup that gets you.\n\nChris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego, is an adviser to Republicans for the Rule of Law and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
