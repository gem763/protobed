(AP) - UConn freshman forward Richie Springs will sit out this season as an academic redshirt.\n\nSprings is a 6-foot-9 power forward from Brooklyn. He graduated this spring from the MacDuffie School in Granby, Massachusetts.\n\nThe 18-year-old made the decision in August to forgo his planned postgraduate year and enroll at UConn this fall.\n\nHe joined a class that included guard James Bouknight, who played with Springs at MacDuffie. Bouknight\u2019s status with the team is in question following his arrest earlier this month after fleeing from police at the scene of a one-car crash near campus.\n\nOther freshmen include guard Jalen Gaffney and forward Akok Akok, who enrolled in January, but did not play last season.\n\nThe announcement was made prior to the team\u2019s exhibition game Wednesday against Division II St. Michael\u2019s of Vermont. The Huskies open the regular season on Nov. 8 against in-state rival Sacred Heart.\n\n.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "UConn freshman forward Richie Springs will sit out this season as an academic redshirt.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
