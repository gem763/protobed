The problems began for the Frenchman when he decided to try a Cruyff turn inside his own six-yard box against Southampton. Danny Ings would not be fooled and tapped into an empty net.\n\nSpurs held on for victory against the Saints but Lloris wouldn't be so lucky against Brighton. After just three minutes, the 32-year-old tried to catch a deep cross when a tip over the bar was required, putting the ball on a plate for the grateful Neal Maupay.\n\nTo make matters worse, Lloris dislocated his left elbow as he stumbled into the net and will be out of action until the turn of the year.\n\nHugo Lloris injured himself whilst making a mistake in Tottenham's 3-0 defeat by Brighton\n\nDARYL JANMAAT\n\nWatford have been awful this season. They sit at the bottom of the table having lost five of their first eight matches, including an embarrassing 8-0 defeat at Manchester City.\n\nThe Hornets have conceded 20 league goals already and Janmaat's bizarre headed effort against Wolves was the comedy pick of the bunch.\n\nWatford defender Daryl Janmaat looks dejected after scoring an own goal against Wolves\n\nJAN BEDNAREK\n\nThe Southampton man has been directly involved in three opposition goals this season, more than any other player in the top flight.\n\nThe Poland international was at fault when Roberto Firmino found the net for Liverpool, and knocked over goalkeeper Angus Gunn to allow Callum Wilson to score for Bournemouth.\n\nJan Bednarek has been directly involved in three goals scored against Southampton\n\nGRANT HANLEY\n\nDaniel Farke was looking for a hero to lead his Norwich team in the Premier League curtain-raiser at Liverpool after first choice centre back Cristoph Zimmermann suffered an injury in pre-season.\n\nGrant Hanley was selected and repaid his manager with a calamitous own goal at Anfield and another cumbersome display against Chelsea before picking up a groin strain.\n\nNorwich's Grant Hanley holds his head in his hands after slicing into his own net at Anfield\n\nNICOLAS OTAMENDI\n\nOtamendi is playing out of position in our team, meaning he would probably wreak even more havoc. His nonchalance on the ball was punished during Manchester City's shock defeat by Norwich.\n\nEmi Buendia nipped in to tee up Teemu Pukki for the Canaries' third goal; a moment of madness which has encouraged Pep Guardiola to drop the Argentine in favour of midfielder Fernandinho.\n\nNicolas Otamendi handed Norwich a third goal in the shock 3-2 defeat at Carrow Road\n\nJESSE LINGARD\n\nAt 26, Jesse Lingard is at an age where he should be making a positive impact in every game he plays for Manchester United.\n\nWith no goals or assists this term, he continues to drift in and out of matches in a style which typifies the lack of quality in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dressing room.\n\nJesse Lingard remains unable to consistently make an impact for Manchester United\n\nGRANIT XHAKA\n\nUnai Emery made Granit Xhaka one of his five captains last month; a decision which has understandably led Arsenal fans to despair over a lack of leadership in the squad.\n\nThe midfielder has already received four yellow cards and hardly proved he was committed to the Arsenal cause when he appeared to duck out of the way of Scott McTominay's strike at Old Trafford.\n\nArsenal captain Granit Xhaka has already been shown four yellow cards this season\n\nFRED\n\nFred's performance against an inexperienced Newcastle midfield provided another example of the midfielder's incompetence in a United shirt.\n\nThe Brazilian, who joined the Red Devils in a \u00a352million deal in 2018, has not found a team-mate with a through ball since April.\n\nManchester United's \u00a352m midfielder Fred continues to struggle in the Premier League\n\nISAAC HAYDEN\n\nIsaac Hayden was rightly sent off against Leicester for a horrific foul on Dennis Praet. The tackle itself and indignant protest that followed were disrespectful towards both Praet and referee Craig Pawson.\n\nThe Belgian was fortunate to avoid a broken leg. Hayden remains suspended and Matty Longstaff is making the most of his opportunity in the Newcastle midfield.\n\nIsaac Hayden remonstrates with the fourth official as he leaves the field after being sent off\n\nNICOLAS PEPE\n\nArsenal broke their transfer record this summer by bringing in Nicolas Pepe from Lille for \u00a372million. He has showed some promise, but hasn't delivered when it comes to the important stats.\n\nTwo assists, and just one goal which came against newly promoted Aston Villa, so Unai Emery will be hoping for more from the Ivorian.\n\nArsenal paid Lille \u00a372million for Nicolas Pepe this summer, and he hasn't set the world on fire\n\nMOISE KEAN\n\nEverton are lingering near the bottom of the Premier League and could do with striker Moise Kean living up to his \u00a327.3m price tag. The Italian is yet to score in eight appearances for the Toffees.\n\nSky Sports pundit Graeme Souness has also criticised Kean, rather harshly suggesting the 19-year-old has an attitude problem after the 3-2 win over Wolves.\n\nMoise Kean was slammed by pundit Graeme Souness after Everton's win over Wolves\n\nBENCH\n\nMartin Dubravka, Michael Keane, Jose Holebas, Paul Pogba, Florin Andone, Miguel Almiron, Serge Aurier.", "description": "With Premier League players having jetted off to represent their countries on the second international break of 2019-20, now seems a fitting moment to reflect on the start to the season.", "authors": ["Tom Caldon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19557108-0-image-a-2_1570739020047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
