One hype play at the Overwatch League grand finals revealed the hero\u2019s potential as an aerial circus act.\n\nEarly on in the San Francisco Shock\u2019s 4-0 sweep of the Vancouver Titans, Bastion player Minho \u201cArchitect\u201d Park was helping his team finish the final point at the Eichenwalde map. It\u2019s usually a good call to position Bastion on high ground so it gets more angles on the enemy team. Some savvy players will push it up onto a ledge with an ice wall from the hero Mei; others might exploit little glitches in the maps. Park did something new altogether:\n\nPropelling himself onto the chandelier with Bastion\u2019s explosive tank-mode shells, Park achieves a perfect 360-degree vantage point for maximum kills. The live crowd watching went absolutely ballistic (pun intended) as he proceeded to mow down Titans\u2019 stragglers racing onto the point. Caster Mitch \u201cUber\u201d Leslie described him as a \u201ctrapeze artist.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference after the game, Park was asked what inspired the move. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned,\u201d he said, with translation from Shock general manager Chris Chung. Chung paraphrased, \u201cOriginally, Rascal was supposed to use a Mei wall to lift [Park] up to get onto the chandelier. But out of nowhere, [Park] told himself he\u2019d able to use Bastion\u2019s ult to boost himself from the floor. It was an instant decision he made.\u201d\n\nLogic says it was, at best, improbable that a pro made this risky move for the first time when over $1,630,000 was on the line. But regardless, I\u2019m looking forward to my teammates copying trapeze Bastion in-game. To my enemies, though: Shh, you never saw this.", "description": "It\u2019s unlikely that, before yesterday, anybody used the words \u201ctrapeze artist\u201d to describe Overwatch\u2019s turret hero Bastion.
