Some patients might have continued vaping and reinjured their lungs, or the original injury might have made them more susceptible to other illnesses, Dr. Schuchat said.\n\nSome patients also had symptoms relapse after steroid treatment for their lung inflammation was tapered off following their discharges, according to the officials.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until this summer that doctors and public-health officials realized that patients presenting with pneumonia-like symptoms had injured their lungs due to vaping. The precise cause of the injuries is under investigation and doctors have begun exploring what, if any, long-term health effects vaping-related injuries might be.\n\nDoctors have expressed concern that lung-scarring and difficulty breathing could linger, or long-term lung disease could crop up after the illness appeared to go away. Another concern is whether patients would be more susceptible to the flu, since weakened lungs might increase the risk of infection.\n\nVIEW In Depth Follow the latest news and top stories about the public health crisis around e-cigarettes from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFlu season, which started this month, may also increase the difficulty of diagnosing injuries. Doctors will have to distinguish between the viral flu infection and similar symptoms in vaping patients.\n\n\u201c\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of confusion,\u201d Lori Shah, a transplant pulmonologist at New-York-Presbyterian and Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said.\n\nAs of Oct. 8, there have been 1,299 cases of vaping-related pulmonary illness in 49 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The CDC has confirmed 26 deaths, not including a death in Utah reported on Wednesday by the Utah Department of Health. More are under investigation.\n\nAlso Friday, the CDC released guidelines to help physicians identify, treat and track patients. The agency recommended that patients should have a follow-up visit no later than one to two weeks after discharge, and should return in one to two months to potentially undergo more testing that assesses lung capacity and function.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people stop vaping THC-containing products specifically and to not buy any products from unregulated, black market sources or modify the ones they purchase legally. The majority of products linked to the illnesses contain THC, the psychoactive component in cannabis, and most were from unregulated, black market sources.\n\nThe agency also says people might want to consider refraining from nicotine vaping products, as some patients also report vaping nicotine exclusively.", "description": "Some patients released from the hospital after suffering from vaping-related illnesses had to be readmitted after relapses, underlining the challenges of treating the mysterious lung injuries.", "authors": ["Brianna Abbott", "Brianna.Abbott Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-116319/social", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
