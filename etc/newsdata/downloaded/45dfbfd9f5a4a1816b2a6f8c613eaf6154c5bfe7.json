And critics assail its proposal to develop an even larger area of land in return for a cut of taxes once that first project is complete.\n\nSeattle\u2019s city council passed a new business tax last year before reversing course under pressure from companies including Amazon.\n\nCity governments have also been at the forefront of pushing back against services bringing the sharing economy model to homes (Airbnb), to cars (Uber and Lyft), and to scooters (Bird and Lime).\n\nThe big picture: Some cities have existing political structures, including unions, that can mobilize against rapid corporate expansion. Many companies haven't needed the grassroots capability to combat that until now.\n\nKathryn Wylde, president of business coalition Partnership for New York City, which has urged Amazon to reconsider pulling HQ2 out of Queens, argued that the backlash was driven by politically-savvy forces taking advantage of community anxieties.\n\n\u201cI think there are organized political interests,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the communities are necessarily political, but they are fearful and resentful in some cases and don\u2019t see a chance for themselves in the tech world because they don\u2019t have those skills, their kids aren\u2019t learning those skills in school.\u201d\n\nYes, but: Many communities vocally protect their values and priorities regardless of the business interests involved. And some firms have successfully navigated growth without a backlash, including Google in New York.\n\n\u201cThe local debates are around local issues, and some of those are currently front of mind because of the role that the growth of technology companies has played, but in most of those cities those don\u2019t have anything to do with tech,\u201d said Julie Samuels, head of the industry advocacy group Tech:NYC.\n\nCorey Johnson, speaker of New York City Council and a critic of Amazon's HQ2 project, said he welcomes tech firms, but \"[w]e would hope that all tech companies would try to be good neighbors, be willing to work with the community when they explore locating here, and follow reasonable and smart data driven regulations.\"\n\nWhat to watch: The fight in Toronto is in full swing. Sidewalk Labs spokesperson Keerthana Rang said \"robust\" public debate will allow it to present the best plan, \"after which it will be up to Toronto to decide whether to move forward and implement it.\"", "description": "The \u201ctechlash\u201d has created noise in Washington, but it\u2019s at the Main Street level that some companies have run headlong into community activists", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/r0VzV8Xu29ZKo-IHNm3FvfW7GOA=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/03/26/1553630185986.png", "published_at": "2019-03-27"}
