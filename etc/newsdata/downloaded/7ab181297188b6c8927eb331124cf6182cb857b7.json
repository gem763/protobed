The paper quoted an unnamed source familiar with Bowling Green operations as saying, \"I know for a fact that this strike is directly going to affect the start of regular production\" for the new model.\n\nUAW workers went out on strike at 11:59 p.m. on September 15. Although the two sides have made attempts, talks have \"taken a turn for the worse\" in the past few days, the UAW said in a statement quoted by the New York Times.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Detroit Free Press cites inside sources saying plant retool is held up by the strike against GM.", "authors": ["Laura Sky Brown"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I8x8PwQslFYG0b1rcCYrwA--~B/aD04NzA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/820550de673c70422ed41a7d2038d8e9", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
