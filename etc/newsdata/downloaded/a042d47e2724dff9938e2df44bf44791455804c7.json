After watching the trailer for ABC\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9 Presents: Making The Gift, however, you\u2019re ready to just let those cameras roll, 24/7. The making-of special will reportedly offer you an inside-look at Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s process while creating her Lion King-inspired album The Gift, which turns out to be way more exciting than the first couple seconds of brainstorming around a conference table might suggest. Instead, the singer journeys through, and works with artists from, Africa. Though, there appears to be plenty of brainstorming around a conference table, if you\u2019re into that too. Not as much repeatedly watching the animated Lion King for days on end as we would have indulged in, but there\u2019s a reason we\u2019re not Beyonc\u00e9. Making The Gift airs on ABC this Monday, September 16 at 10pm EST.\n\nRelated", "description": "ABC to air Making The Gift, a documentary going behind-the-scenes of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s The Lion King album The Gift.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/15-Making-The-Gift-Beyonce.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
