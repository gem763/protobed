Before the disease progressed he did write his story, and at some point that will be shared in his own book. We see this as his, much as I\u2019m sure Demi sees her book as her own.\u201d\n\nThrough the blog, Renee has been raising awareness of the devastating disease that impairs memory and has encouraged readers to reach out about how it has impacted their own families.\n\nDEMI MOORE: ASHTON KUTCHER MOCKED MY ALCOHOLISM\n\nJON CRYER DENIES DEMI MOORE\u2019S CLAIM THAT SHE TOOK HIS VIRGINITY\n\n\u201cI married the love of my life,\u201d wrote Renee in a post dated February of this year. \u201cHe was brilliant, a genius in fact, handsome, and so loving and giving, the sweetest person you could ever meet. He was an amazing songwriter, musician and singer. We would have conversations until the early hours of the morning and being together was heavenly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 35 years of loving each other and marriage, we got the horrible news that Rick had Alzheimer\u2019s disease at age 60,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut 60? It is such a young age 60. Men even have kids at 60, my dad did. People don\u2019t retire until 65.
