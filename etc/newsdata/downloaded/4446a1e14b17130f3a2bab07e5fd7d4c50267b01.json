REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) earlier lowered its benchmark cash rate by another quarter-point from 1% in an attempt to kick-start the economy amid sluggish mortgage demand, putting further pressure on banks\u2019 profits.\n\n\u201cThis sustained very low interest rates environment will weigh down on net interest margins and hence bank earnings power,\u201d said Matthew Wilson, a senior banking analyst at Evans & Partners.\n\nNet interest income for the four largest banks, which dominate about 80% of the deposit and house lending market, could fall by about A$8.4 billion ($5.66 billion) if the central bank moved rates to zero percent, Wilson estimated.\n\nThe final impact would depend on a number of other factors including how much of the benchmark rate cut is passed on to customers and banks\u2019 interest rate hedging techniques, with the official cash rate widely expected at 0.5% by early next year.\n\n\u201cThe RBA now has only three, or possibly even fewer, more conventional cuts available to them before they will have to venture into unconventional monetary easing territory \u2014 negative rates, QE (quantitative easing), or bond yield targeting,\u201d ING\u2019s chief Asia-Pacific economist Rob Carnell said.\n\nUBS analyst Jonathan Mott said that despite the expected pick-up in lending from lower rates, the banks\u2019 \u201cfundamentals are increasingly challenged with ultra-low interest rates\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe benefit to bank revenues would likely be offset by NIM pressure given the rate cuts required to re-stimulate the housing market,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nCommonwealth Australia Bank (CBA.AX), Westpac Banking Group (WBC.AX), National Australia Bank (NAB.AX), and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) (ANZ.AX) have resisted public pressure to fully pass on the past two central bank rate cuts to customers.\n\nCBA become the first of the Big Four to defy a call from national Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to pass on the full cut to mortgage customers, saying it faces a \u201cdifficult balancing act\u201d. That raises questions about the potential effectiveness of super easy monetary policy.\n\n\u201cIt is the government\u2019s expectation that the banks will pass on this 25 basis point rate cut in full,\u201d Frydenberg had earlier told reporters in Sydney.\n\nCBA, Australia\u2019s top lender, said instead it would cut its standard variable owner-occupier interest rates, a key gauge, by 0.13 percentage points.\n\nAlthough they remain some of the most profitable banks worldwide, Australia\u2019s Big Four reported a combined profit of A$14.5 billion for the first half of their financial years, down 4% from a year prior, as they were hit with sluggish credit growth and billions in remediation costs from wrongdoing.\n\nThe fall was also partly driven by a 11 basis point reduction in net interest margins, the difference between the rates paid and charged for money lent by banks, to 1.95%.\n\nAs the cash rate falls toward zero, it gets harder to reduce deposit rates to offset the cheaper mortgages they must now offer borrowers, while also losing on lower investment rates.\n\nIf rates moved to zero percent, NIM margins could shrink by as much as 26 basis points, Evans & Partners\u2019 Wilson said. The calculation excluded all other factors, he added.", "description": "Australian banks' net interest margins will be hurt by Tuesday's cut in interest rates to an unprecedented low of 0.75% and any further central bank action to stimulate the economy, analysts said.", "authors": ["Paulina Duran", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435802285&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9026O", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
