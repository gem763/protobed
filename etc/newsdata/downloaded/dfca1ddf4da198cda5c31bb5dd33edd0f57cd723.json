But these insects have now been mutated so that they can stomach the once poisonous milkweed\n\nThe team led by Professor Noah Whiteman achieved their feat using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing \u2013 essentially cutting and pasting sections of DNA.\n\nThey made three CRISPR edits in a single gene - modifications identical to the genetic mutations that allow the monarch butterflies s to feast on milkweed and harvest its poison.\n\nThese mutations have allowed it to eat common poisonous plants other insects could not and are key to the butterfly's thriving presence throughout North and Central America.\n\nFlies with the triple genetic mutation proved to be 1,000 times less sensitive to milkweed toxin than the wild fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.\n\nProfessor Whiteman said: 'All we did was change three sites, and we made these superflies.\n\nIn the first ever case of recreating evolution in a multicellular organism, professor Noah Whiteman of the University of California, Berkeley, have made three edits in a single gene to give these fruit flies the resilience of the monarch butterfly (file photo)\n\nA Monarch caterpillar feeds on a milkweed, making it poisonous to predators such as birds and frogs\n\n'But to me, the most amazing thing is that we were able to test evolutionary hypotheses in a way that has never been possible outside of cell lines.\n\n'It would have been difficult to discover this without having the ability to create mutations with CRISPR.'\n\nHowever the monarch's resistance to milkweed comes at a cost, as the butterfly takes longer to recover from injuries and sickness.\n\nProfessor Whiteman said: 'This shows there is a cost to mutations, in terms of recovery of the nervous system and probably other things we don't know about.\n\n'But the benefit of being able to escape a predator is so high ... if it's death or toxins, toxins will win, even if there is a cost.'\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature.", "description": "In the first ever case of recreating evolution in a multicellular organism, professor Noah Whiteman of the University of California, Berkeley, gave fruit flies the resilience of the monarch butterfly.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/16/19212350-0-image-a-38_1570031589971.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
