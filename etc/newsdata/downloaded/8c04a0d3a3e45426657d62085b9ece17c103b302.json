Throughout his decades-long tenure in public office, the former vice president sought cooperation with Beijing, at one point even claiming China\u2019s rise was \u201cpositive\u201d for America. Since launching his presidential campaign this year, however, that position has become increasingly controversial, especially as President Donald Trump wages a trade war with the communist power over its exploitive and manipulative economic practices.\n\nSuch controversy was on display this year during another trip to Iowa, where Biden scoffed at the notion that China was a threat to the American worker.\n\n\u201cI hear these stories about how China is going to eat our lunch. Give me a break!\u201d Biden said, before adding, \u201cThey\u2019re not bad folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, man. \u2026 They can\u2019t figure out how they are going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system,\u201d the former vice president continued. \u201cI mean, you know, they\u2019re not bad folks, folks. But guess what: they\u2019re not competition for us.\u201d\n\nThe remarks quickly drew widespread rebuke from both those on the right and left, most notably from Trump and Republicans. Many, though, also noted that the former vice president\u2019s youngest son, Hunter Biden, had negotiated lucrative business deals with a Chinese company later identified as having ties to the Communist regime in Beijing.\n\nAs Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends Hunter Biden inked a $1.5 dollar deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China only ten days after he visited the country with his father aboard Air Force Two in 2013:\n\nIn December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, \u2018If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.\u2019 Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.\n\nSuch criticism and the renewed interest in Schweizer\u2019s findings forced the former vice president to reverse his tone on China in June.\n\n\u201cYou bet I\u2019m worried about China\u2014if we keep following Trump\u2019s path,\u201d Biden said during a campaign swing through Iowa at the time. \u201cWhile Trump is tweeting, China is making massive investments in technologies of the future.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden claimed \u201cChina is not our problem\u201d on Tuesday, appearing to once again flip-flop on the threat posed by the communist regime.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Joe-Biden-hold-up-hand-US-China-flags-background-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
