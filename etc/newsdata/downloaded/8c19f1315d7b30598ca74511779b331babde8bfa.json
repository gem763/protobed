The comforting and relaxing sound of firearm discharges in residential streets; the fun of dodging ricocheting bullets; the acceptable collateral damage of the odd pet.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCllr Radford, representative for the Tuebrook and Stoneycroft ward, said the council had forked out \u00a31.5million to repair walls that had been gnawed through by rats.\n\n\u2018We have an overwhelming outbreak of vermin in Liverpool,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Alleyways are collapsing where rats are burrowing underneath them.\u2019\n\nHe suggested implementing a \u2018good professional system\u2019 inviting shooting club members to \u2018come at set times to cull the rats\u2019.\n\n\u2018Maybe its worth looking at an isolated trial and asking the shooting lobby if we could look at a scheme using people who are trained in the use of guns to go out and kill rats and see if it has a benefit to the public,\u2019 he told the Liverpool Echo.\n\n\u2018I would be happy for us to try it in my ward first.\u2019\n\nMr Anderson rubbished the idea, telling the meeting it \u2018doesn\u2019t deserve any credibility at all\u2019.\n\nHe said \u2018the most effective and most cost effective\u2019 way of curbing the problem was cutting down on the amount of food waste on the streets and targeted poisoning programmes.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
