(AP)\n\nThere were reports just a couple of weeks after the injury that Smith had an extended hospital stay because of an infection. In a June interview with Fox 5 DC, Smith admitted that the first four months were \u201creally, really hard,\u201d both physically and mentally. At the time, he was still wearing an external fixator, essentially a bulky metal halo that screwed into the bones of his lower right leg, and he credited it with saving his bone and leg.\n\nThe fixator was removed in mid-July.\n\nAccording to a Wednesday report by Thom Loverro of the Washington Times, Smith\u2019s recovery has been even more grueling than first believed: speaking to an audience of mostly medical professionals at Inova Sports Medicine earlier this month, Smith said he\u2019s undergone 17 surgeries.\n\nLoverro cited a person who attended the event that asked not to be identified.\n\nThat person said there was an audible gasp from the crowd when Smith revealed that number.\n\nIn December, NFL Network reported Smith had undergone six surgeries to clean up the infection and remove tissue.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Washington spokesman said the team does not comment on individual player-specific medical questions. Smith did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s the plan\u2019\n\nIn that June interview, reporter Angie Goff asked if Smith wanted to play football again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Smith said, but acknowledged that he had a way to go to get to that point.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many surgeries, if any, Smith has had since that interview, but after 17 surgeries we might just call it a career and be happy to have two functioning legs.\n\nThe 17 surgeries is a dramatically different figure than the six the NFL Network reported in December. Those nearly half-dozen operations were reportedly part of an effort to remove tissue after Smith developed an infection following the operation he had to repair the broken fibula and tibia he suffered in that 23-21 loss to the Texans.\n\nIt is not known if all the operations that followed were related to the infections, though the absurd number of operations would indicate that the infections were severe.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Smith revealed the number to an audience of medical professionals.", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ERHS9saoX4WUw.TSI2nXLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.2ziqVq7qoFJ93y9HkbAXg--~B/aD0yNTY5O3c9Mzg1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c59dc1d0-f024-11e9-b37f-3a1995012b2d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
