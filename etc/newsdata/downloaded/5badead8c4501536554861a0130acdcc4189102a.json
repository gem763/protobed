The image, which was taken during her summer getaway to Bora Bora, saw Lovato looking over her shoulder as she wades in knee-deep water while featuring her backside.\n\nThough Lovato appeared to embrace her body in the steamy shot, the star revealed it actually took a lot for her to post the snap without editing her appearance, as she has a \u201cfear\u201d of exposing the cellulite and imperfections of her body to the world.\n\nLovato even admitted that the fear has prompted her to alter previous bikini photos from her Bora Bora vacation, but said that she realized she was tired of attempting to live up to unrealistic standards of beauty.\n\n\u201cThis is my biggest fear. A photo of me in a bikini unedited. And guess what, it\u2019s CELLULIT!!!!\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m just literally sooooo tired of being ashamed of my body, editing it (yes the other bikini pics were edited \u2013 and I hate that I did that but it\u2019s the truth) so that others think I\u2019m THEIR idea of what beautiful is, but it\u2019s just not me.\u201d\n\nDemi Lovato | Demi Lovato/Instagram More\n\nRELATED: Demi Lovato Flaunts Her Curves in Leopard-Print Bikini During Bora Bora Vacation\n\n\u201cThis is what I got,\u201d Lovato proudly stated. \u201cI want this new chapter in my life to be about being authentic to who I am rather than trying to meet someone else\u2019s standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo here\u2019s me, unashamed, unafraid and proud to own a body that has fought through so much and will continue to amaze me when I hopefully give birth one day,\u201d she continued, seemingly referencing her battles with addiction, mental illness and disordered eating, as well as her near-fatal overdose in July 2018.\n\nLovato went on to share what a relief it\u2019s been to be back in front of the screen without worrying about her weight and diet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a great feeling to be back in tv/film while not stressing myself with a strenuous workout schedule before 14 hour days, or depriving myself from a real birthday cake rather than opting for watermelon & whip cream with candles because I was terrified of REAL cake and was miserable on some crazy diet s\u2014,\u201d Lovato revealed.\n\nDemi Lovato's edited bikini photo from May | Demi Lovato/Instagram More\n\n\u201cAnyway, here\u2019s me, RAW, REAL!
