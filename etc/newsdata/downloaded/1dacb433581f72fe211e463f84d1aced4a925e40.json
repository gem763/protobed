To quote the insurers themselves.\n\n'You will not be covered if you do not act in a responsible way to protect yourself and your property to avoid making a claim.\n\n'If you're not insured to ride a Harley in Australia, what makes you think you can do so overseas!? Remember to pay attention to the limits when it comes to maximum engine sizes you're allowed to ride.'\n\n'Some insurers do not require you to have a license if riding a low capacity engine. Others have maximum engine size limits which you're only insured to drive up to - irrespective of what your license says. And then there are those that cover you for whatever engine size you ride as long as you're insured to do so in Australia.'", "description": "Ashley Hickman, from Cairns, was rushed to\u00a0Kuta Hospital\u00a0after a devastating scooter crash on 31 August.
