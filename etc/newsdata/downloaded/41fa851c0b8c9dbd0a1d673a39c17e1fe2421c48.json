The initiative is part of the Sesame Street in Communities resources available online.\n\n\u201cSesame Street\u201d creators said they turned to the issue of addiction since data shows 5.7 million children under age 11 live in households with a parent with substance use disorder.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else out there that addresses substance abuse for young, young kids from their perspective,\u201d said Kama Einhorn, a senior content manager with Sesame Workshop. It\u2019s also a chance to model to adults a way to explain what they\u2019re going through to kids and to offer simple strategies to cope.\n\n\u201cEven a parent at their most vulnerable - at the worst of their struggle - can take one thing away when they watch it with their kids, then that serves the purpose,\u201d Einhorn said.\n\nThis summer in Manhattan, The Associated Press looked on as puppeteers, producers and show creators crammed into a small studio in the nonprofit\u2019s Manhattan headquarters to tape some of the upcoming segments.\n\nKarli, voiced and manipulated by puppeteer Haley Jenkins, was joined by a young girl - 10-year-old Salia Woodbury, whose parents are in recovery.\n\n\u201cHi, it\u2019s me, Karli. I\u2019m here with my friend Salia. Both of our parents have had the same problem - addiction,\u201d Karli told the camera.\n\n\u201cMy mom and dad told me that addiction is a sickness,\u201d Salia said.\n\n\u201cYeah, a sickness that makes people feel like they have to take drugs or drink alcohol to feel OK. My mom was having a hard time with addiction and I felt like my family was the only one going through it. But now I\u2019ve met so many other kids like us. It makes me feel like we\u2019re not alone,\u201d the puppet continued.\n\n\u201cRight, we\u2019re not alone,\u201d Salia responded. \u201cAnd it\u2019s OK to open up to people about our feelings.\u201d\n\nIn the segment, Karli and Salia each hold up hand-drawn pictures of flowers, with multiple petals representing \u201cbig feelings\u201d - like anger, sadness and happiness. They offer ways to feel better, including art and breathing exercises.\n\nThe segment leans on carefully considered language. Creators prefer \u201caddiction\u201d to \u201csubstance abuse\u201d and \u201crecovery\u201d to \u201csobriety\u201d because those terms are clearer to children. Despite the subject, the mood was light in the room, largely thanks to Jenkins\u2019 calm and empathic manner.\n\n\u201cI know it feels awkward because people don\u2019t normally have conversations standing shoulder-to-shoulder,\u201d she told Salia between takes. \u201cThis is weird, but trust me, it looks good.\u201d\n\nKarli had already been introduced as a puppet in foster care earlier this year but viewers now will understand why her mother had to go away for a while. The introduction of her backstory follows other attempts by entertainment companies to explore the issues of addiction, including \u201cThe Connors\u201d on ABC and \u201cEuphoria\u201d on HBO.\n\nThe online-only segments with Karli and Salia are augmented with ones that feature Elmo\u2019s dad, Louie, explaining that addiction is a sickness , and Karli telling Elmo and Chris about her mom\u2019s special adult meetings and her own kids\u2019 ones.\n\nKarli also opens up about her family to Abby Cadabby in another segment, and Karli tells Elmo about how she mistakenly used to feel like her mom\u2019s addiction was her fault. Karli, Elmo, Rosita and Abby Cadabby also sing \u201cWe\u2019re Special and So Are You.\u201d Viewers are referred to free online resources in both English and Spanish that include videos, storybooks, digital interactives and games.\n\nChildren\u2019s therapist Jerry Moe, the national director of the Hazelden Betty Ford Children\u2019s Program, helped craft the segments and resources, saying he was grateful to help since there\u2019s been a paucity of resources for the preschool age-group.\n\n\u201cThese boys and girls are the first to get hurt and, unfortunately, the last to get help,\u201d he said. \u201cFor them to see Karli and learn that it\u2019s not their fault and this stuff is hard to talk about and it\u2019s OK to have these feelings, that\u2019s important. And that there\u2019s hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cSesame Street,\u201d which began airing in 1969, has a long history of tackling topical issues in a way approachable to children. It\u2019s had puppets with HIV, jailed parents and autism, explored homelessness, women\u2019s rights and even girls singing about loving their hair.\n\n\u201cFor everything we\u2019ve done - from military families to homelessness - it\u2019s all about how to make children free to talk and to give parents the tools to do just that. They tend to avoid it and it\u2019s what they need more than anything,\u201d said Sherrie Westin, president of global impact and philanthropy for Sesame Workshop.\n\nSalia\u2019s parents - Sam and Jaana Woodbury, who are raising four girls in Orange County, California - said they welcomed the show\u2019s attention on opioid and alcohol addiction. They\u2019ve been in recovery for about eight years.\n\n\u201cWhen I was going through addiction, I felt extremely alone and isolated. I didn\u2019t have any connection to the outside world,\u201d said Jaana Woodbury. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 is using their platform to share resources to help other women and fathers.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the taped segment with Karli and Salia, the puppet turns to the girl. \u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re friends, Salia,\u201d Karli said.\n\n\u201cMe, too, Karli,\u201d Salia responds.\n\n\u201cCan I have a hug?\u201d Karli asks.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d says her friend.\n\nAnd they do.\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Sesame Street\" is taking a new step to try to help kids navigate life in America - it's tackling the opioid crisis.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/tv-sesame_street-addiction_78265_c0-82-1958-1223_s1770x1032.jpg?4a5a4bef794f7aa61e047c368d110c01395123e3", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
