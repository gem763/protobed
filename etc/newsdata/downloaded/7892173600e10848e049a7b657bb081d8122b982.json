Later, staff at the lawyer's office learned that at least two families in the group were ordered deported for not showing up to court.\n\nSince it started in January, the rollout of one of the most dramatic changes to U.S. immigration policy under the Trump administration has been marked by unpredictability and created chaos in immigration courts, according to dozens of interviews with judges and attorneys, former federal officials and migrants.\n\nThe program - known as the \"Migrant Protection Protocols\" (MPP) - has forced tens of thousands of people to wait in Mexico for U.S. court dates, swamping the dockets and leading to delays and confusion as judges and staff struggle to handle the influx of cases.\n\nIn June, a U.S. immigration official told a group of congressional staffers that the program had \"broken the courts,\" according to two participants and contemporaneous notes taken by one of them. The official said that the court in El Paso at that point was close to running out of space for paper files, according to the attendees, who requested anonymity because the meeting was confidential.\n\nTheresa Cardinal Brown, a former Department of Homeland Security official under presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, said the problems are \"symptomatic of a system that's not coordinating well.\"\n\n\"It's a volume problem, it's a planning problem, it's a systems problem and it's an operational problem on the ground,\" said Brown, now a director at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank. \"They're figuring everything out on the fly.\"\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) estimated that 42,000 migrants had been sent to wait in Mexico through early September. That agency and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which runs the nation's immigration courts, referred questions about the program's implementation to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHUGE SURGE, FEW COURTS\n\nThe disarray is the result of a surge in migrants, most of them Central Americans, at the U.S. southern border, combined with the need for intricate legal and logistical arrangements for MPP proceedings in a limited number of courts - only in San Diego and El Paso, initially. Rather than being released into the United States to coordinate their own transportation and legal appearances, migrants in MPP must come and go across the border strictly under U.S. custody.\n\nSome migrants have turned up in court only to find that their cases are not in the system or that the information on them is wrong, several attorneys told Reuters. Others, like Katia, have received conflicting instructions.\n\nAccording to court documents seen by Reuters, Katia's notice to appear stated that her hearing was at 7:30 a.m., while another paper she received said she should arrive at the border at 9 a.m., well after her hearing was set to start. She decided to show up at the border before dawn, according to staff in her lawyer's office. Still, she wasn't allowed into the border facility until hours later. Ultimately she was never bussed to the San Diego court and was told her case was closed - a fate she was able to avoid only after frantically summoning her lawyer, Ghazialam, to the border.\n\nMost migrants in MPP - including the two families who were deported from her group at the port of entry - do not have lawyers.", "description": "After waiting two months in Mexico to press her case for U.S. asylum, the 20-year-old student from Nicaragua arrived at the border near Tijuana three hours before the critical hearing was scheduled to start at 7:30 a.m.  \"We kept asking what was going on, but they wouldn't tell us anything,&", "authors": ["Mica Rosenberg", "Kristina Cooke", "Reade Levinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5Y4OBJQyrwBWwDAhxz3VRQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/4001f750dbdc4de399de54b1cae57222", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
