He was named minister of state for energy affairs in 2017 and worked closely with previous oil minister Ali al-Naimi for years as his deputy.\n\nSome industry insiders say his lengthy experience has helped overcome an unwritten rule against appointing a royal to run the oil portfolio in Saudi Arabia. Conventional wisdom has held that giving it to a prince could upset the Al Saud dynasty\u2019s delicate balance of power and risk making oil policy hostage to princely politicking, Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz\u2019s appointment as energy minister was announced in a royal decree published by state news agency SPA.\n\nSaudi Arabia has had five oil ministers since 1960, and none of them has been a royal.\n\nLast month, Riyadh created a ministry for industry and mineral resources, separating it from the kingdom\u2019s colossal energy ministry. Previously, Falih had overseen more than half the Saudi economy through the super-ministry, which was created in 2016 to help streamline new reforms.\n\nLast week, Falih was also removed from his post as chairman of Aramco, and Yasser al-Rumayyan, who heads the sovereign wealth fund PIF, was named as the new chairman.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been pumping less than 10 million barrels per day for most of 2019, below its OPEC output target. Falih has helped broker the deal with non-OPEC producers led by Russia, emerging as the main face of OPEC and the kingdom\u2019s oil diplomacy over the past three years.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's king appointed his son, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, as energy minister on Sunday, replacing Khalid al-Falih and for the first time handing the portfolio in the world's top oil exporter to a member of the royal family.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
