Devin Nunes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\ngive Trump and White House counsel staff chances to participate in hearings by submitting written testimony and responses, physically attending the hearings, and cross-examining witnesses, with the caveat that the relevant committees can deny those requests if the White House refuses to cooperate with the inquiry\n\nvest the power to determine whether articles of impeachment are sent to the full House with the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nBy bringing the impeachment inquiry into its \"public phase,\" the resolution is virtually negating all of the GOP's criticisms that the inquiry is being conducted in secret and the minority and the White House are being shut out of the process.\n\nMinority members of the committees not only get equal time for their staff to question witnesses, but they also can request subpoenas with the approval of the committee chair.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry centers around the claims lodged in an anonymous whistleblower complaint that Trump used \"the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\" in a series of events culminating in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe complaint specifically charged that Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter days after withholding a nearly $400 million military-aid package Congress had already appropriated to Ukraine.\n\nTrump's personal attorney has for months been pushing an unsubstantiated theory that Biden, in his capacity as vice president, called for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board from 2014 to 2019.\n\nSince then, the whistleblower complaint has been corroborated by the White House's own summary notes of the Trump-Zelensky call, White House officials themselves, and the sworn testimony of several career diplomatic and national-security officials.\n\nThe White House's notes of the call confirm Trump brought up how the US does \"a lot for Ukraine\" and, immediately after, asked Zelensky to do him a \"favor, though\" by investigating Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine is in possession of a Democratic National Committee server.\n\nMick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff and director of the Office of Management and Budget, also seemingly acknowledged in a press briefing to reporters last week that the administration engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine to trade US military aid for investigations.\n\n\"Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up the money,\" Mulvaney said during the conference, later doubling down and adding, \"I have news for everybody: Get over it.\"\n\nPressuring a foreign government to dig up dirt on a political opponent is a potential violation of federal campaign-finance laws, and withholding military aid to do so could constitute bribery, extortion, and misappropriation of taxpayer funds \u2014 all of which are issues the impeachment inquiry is looking to explore.\n\nRead more:\n\nMeet Alexander Vindman: The refugee, Army colonel, and Purple Heart recipient testifying about his concerns over Trump's Ukraine dealings\n\nDemocrats just dropped a big hint that they have everything they need to impeach Trump\n\nTrump is getting battered on all fronts as Congress, the courts, and even his own officials eviscerate him\"", "description": "The new rules laid out by House Democrats significantly undercut many of the Republican criticisms of how the impeachment inquiry has been conducted.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db88fc3dee0193868519d53?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
