Through the first-person singular pronoun, he casts himself as the indispensable protagonist in the American story. At a Cabinet meeting last week, for example, he said, \u201cI\u2019m the one that did the capturing,\u201d in reference to Islamic State terrorists. At another point, he said, \u201cLook, I have the strongest economy ever.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most extreme expression of Trump\u2019s vaulting self-conception is his use of the word \u201ctreason.\u201d Treason is a crime so serious that the framers took steps to ensure it wouldn\u2019t be misused for partisan purposes. It is a betrayal of one\u2019s country, defined in Article III of the Constitution as levying war against the U.S., or \u201cadhering to\u201d enemies and giving them \u201caid and comfort.\u201d It\u2019s not how Trump has sought to define it: disloyalty to a political leader or antipathy for that leader\u2019s behavior.\n\nRead: The unraveling of Donald Trump\n\nTrump knows what treason means\u2014or at least he once did. Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One in 2017, he described treason as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg passing secrets to the Soviet Union, acts of espionage that led to their execution in 1953. The word first popped up in his Twitter feed in September 2018 in reference to an anonymous op-ed in The New York Times describing how executive-branch officials resist Trump\u2019s agenda. He has used the word two dozen times this year alone on Twitter, weaponizing it as his anger toward political opponents grows. Democrats who opposed his border measures, he tweeted in April, are \u201cTREASONOUS.\u201d Prosecutors working under Mueller, he tweeted that same day, were perpetrating a \u201cTreasonous Hoax!\u201d\n\nThe latest enemy of the state is Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman who is running the impeachment probe. \u201cI want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\u201d Trump tweeted last month. The crime: characterizing Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a way that didn\u2019t match the rough transcript released by the White House. That doesn\u2019t sound like grounds for lethal injection, but Trump doesn\u2019t seem to care. Conspiring with Schiff is another traitorous villain, Trump told his 66 million Twitter followers earlier this month: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who authorized the impeachment probe.\n\nTrump\u2019s use of the word is anachronistic in the modern era, echoing the way monarchs deployed it in centuries past. Carlton Larson, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on treason, told me that Trump has misused the term in ways that \u201cconfuse loyalty to the country with loyalty to Trump, which is the old English idea that treason was betrayal of the king.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s completely inaccurate, woefully so, in his understanding of it, and it\u2019s quite disturbing,\u201d Larson continued. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another president who has tossed around that term so casually. In many countries, treason is used as a way to execute political opponents\u2014and it\u2019s because of that that we have a more limited definition.\u201d", "description": "The president is erasing the distinction between his political needs and the nation\u2019s enduring interests, setting the stage for a potential crisis.", "authors": ["Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX6PBWI/facebook.jpg?1572386629", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
