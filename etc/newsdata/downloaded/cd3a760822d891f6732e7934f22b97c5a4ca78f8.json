In the trailer for the series\u2019 cinematic followup, Aaron Paul\u2019s beloved character is back in the show\u2019s universe and (sensibly) panicked in his El Camino, listening to a radio report about the firefight that ended the television series and left nine male victims (including the late, not-morally-so-great Walter White) dead. Out of the frying pan and into the fire, the fire being the manhunt by law enforcement and any surviving Nazis for a \u201cperson of interest\u201d responsible for the massacre. Luckily, no one owns an El Camino to stay the hell in dodge. El Camino guns it onto Netflix October 11. Oh, uh. Bitch.\n\nRelated", "description": "Aaron Paul returns as Breaking Bad\u2019s Jesse Pinkman in the trailer for movie sequel El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/22/22-el-camino.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
