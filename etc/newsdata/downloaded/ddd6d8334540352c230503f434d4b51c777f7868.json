In September, Hyundai revealed a fuel cell-powered truck called the Xcient for the Swedish market that it promised a year ago.\n\nNow comes the HDC-6 Neptune, named for the Roman god of the seas. The name fits since hydrogen fuel cells emit only water. Hyundai's Translead unit will show an eco-friendly refrigerated concept trailer called HT Nitro ThermoTech. Both are scheduled for reveal on October 29.\n\nThe HDC-6 Neptune design is inspired by the Art Deco function-driven streamliner railway trains of the 1930s. Designers found new ways to combine form and function inside the cab.\n\nBold arching lines of the exterior glow neon blue. Inside, the spacious cabin is positioned at the front of the truck with surrounding glass that increases visibility where traditional A-pillars would create blindspots. Images from live video cameras provide 270 degrees of visibility from the sides and rear of the truck.\n\nThe interior of Hyundai's HDC-6 Neptune hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric truck concept.

(NYSE: TM), which has a partnership with Kenworth Truck Co. to build 10 hydrogen-powered fuel cell heavy-duty trucks for testing in carbon-conscious California.\n\nImage Sourced from Pixabay\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
