(Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press)\n\nDETROIT \u2013 Founders Brewing Co. has finally broken its silence. And it's closing its Detroit taproom \"until further notice.\"\n\nMichigan's largest brewery sent an email to ticket-holders of this weekend's highly anticipated Canadian Breakfast Stout release and party in Detroit that it's canceling said release and party while closing the popular Detroit taproom indefinitely \"in light of the recent events\" and due to safety concerns for its employees.\n\nThose \"recent events,\" of course, include the pending racial discrimination lawsuit that reached national news this week when a leaked deposition first posted by the Detroit Metro Times sparked a social media firestorm and led to some Detroit shops, bars and restaurants pulling Founders products from their shelves.\n\nThe CBS release in Grand Rapids, Mich., where Founders is based, will still go on as planned.\n\nThe email from Founders, via Eventbrite:\n\nIt\u2019s with sincere regret that we share with you that the CBS bottle pickup and CBS tapping party at tour Detroit location won\u2019t be happening, as scheduled. In light of the recent events and, more importantly, out of concern of our employees\u2019 safety, we have decided to close the Detroit taproom from Friday, October 25 until further notice. We greatly appreciate your enthusiasm for the introduction of this year\u2019s CBS. We will be issuing full refunds to all CBS bottle ticket holders as soon as possible. As a reminder, CBS will be widely available in market beginning on November 1. To be clear, the Grand Rapids CBS release will go on as scheduled. Again, we are so regretful to share this news and appreciate your understanding and support of Founders. Thank you.\u201d\n\nCanadian Breakfast Stout, or CBS, is Founders' top-rated beer according to craft beer review website Beer Advocate, and this weekend is to be Founders' last CBS release for the foreseeable future. Since it's brewed in such limited quantities, CBS release parties often feature long lines and a celebratory air as craft beer fans revel in perhaps their only chance that year to pick some up.\n\nFounders confirmed that Detroit taproom employees will be paid during the closure, even as several are planning a peaceful protest Saturday in Detroit \"to address discrimination against Minorities/LGBTQ+/Women in the workforce.\"\n\nThough Founders cited safety concerns, incident records during the past year at Founders' Detroit taproom showed no reports of threats to employees, Detroit police said Friday morning.\n\nThe gift store at Founders Brewing Co.

Those conversations are underway.\n\n\"Because of the pending litigation that has received so much attention of late, we can\u2019t talk any more specifically about the lawsuit that has been in the news. But we want to tell our customers in Detroit, in Michigan and around the country that seeing the integrity and value system of Founders being questioned is one of the hardest things we have ever experienced.\n\n\"We had been advised not to talk about any of this, even as allegations have been cast in our direction. But we realize we need to talk about this now.\n\n\"Whatever falls short \u2013 according to our culture bringing people together and standards \u2013 will be fixed. Our Founders Family will point us in the right direction.\"\n\nEngbers and Stevens opened Founders' doors for the first time in 1997. Over the years, it became one of Michigan's most prominent breweries, creating popular beers such as Red's Rye IPA, Kentucky Breakfast Stout and Dirty Bastard.\n\nFounders Brewing Co. in Detroit on Friday, Dec. 1, 2017. (Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press)\n\nThis decade, the brewery's growth became exponential \u2014 and global. In 2011, Founders began packaging its session All Day IPA, which quickly became its most popular beer in the U.S. In 2014, Founders sold a 30% minority stake to Spanish beer company Mahou San Miguel to expand production and distribution, which led to Founders surpassing Comstock, Mich.-based Bell's Brewery, which remains 100% independent, as Michigan's largest brewery. Earlier this year, Founders became the first Michigan brewery to distribute its beers to all 50 states.\n\nHowever, with such growth came growing pains. None stand more prominently than the racial discrimination lawsuit filed by Tracy Evans, a fired events and promotions manager, last year.\n\nEvans, who is black, alleges that Founders tolerated a \"racist internal corporate culture,\" passed him over promotions because of his race, and witnessed multiple employees say the N-word around him without immediately getting fired (the latter of which Founders admitted to in its response to the lawsuit; it's denied most other allegations). Evans also says Founders management in Grand Rapids electronically named two printers the \"white guy printer\" and \"black guy printer,\" which Founders has denied.\n\nStainless steel brewing tanks can be seen from the beer garden at Founders Brewing Co.

(Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press)\n\nAs the lawsuit makes its way through court, a transcript leaked Monday of a deposition featuring Founders Detroit general manager Dominic Ryan, who fired Evans last year. In the deposition, Ryan would not say whether Evans is black and said he doesn't know whether Barack Obama, Michael Jordan or former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick are black because he's never \"met\" them.\n\nAlso sparking criticism among craft beer enthusiasts was Founders' decision last August to sell a 90% majority stake to Mahou San Miguel, a move some consider to be \"selling out\" to Big Beer. Founders has maintained the move will not affect its beer quality or its commitment to its Michigan customers.\n\nFounders opened the Detroit taproom, its second, in December 2017.\n\nFrank Witsil contributed.\n\nContact Brian Manzullo at bmanzullo@freepress.com and on Untappd, bmanzullo and Twitter, @BrianManzullo and @SpiritsofDET.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2019/10/25/founders-brewing-detroit-taproom-closed/2453993001/", "description": "Founders Brewing Co. breaks silence, cites safety concerns in wake of racial discrimination lawsuit that reached national news this week", "authors": ["Brian Manzullo", "Published A.M.
