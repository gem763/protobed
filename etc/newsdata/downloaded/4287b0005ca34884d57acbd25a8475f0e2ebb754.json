Unneeded by civilians, they are a blight on the nation, their ready availability a national disgrace. Eliminating them would slow the growth of this list. It would save lives.\"\n\nADAM KINZINGER: 'SERIOUS MOVEMENT' BREWING TO OVERTURN ENTIRE SECOND AMENDMENT\n\nDespite the call to action, the article does not tackle the issue of increased background checks, mandatory gun buybacks, regulation of ammunition, red flag laws, or the implications of state efforts to regulate the Second Amendment.\n\nInstead, the article focuses more on emotion and lets the names of the dead stand alone.\n\n\"The list below, far from comprehensive, is tragic, in part, because it is so far from inevitable,\" the story reads.\n\nThe editorial board also asked what it would take to force McConnell's hand on gun legislation, and offered up a hypothetical future where mass shootings occur every day.\n\nJIM DEMING: MASS SHOOTINGS DRIVEN MORE BY 'CULTURE' THAN LACK OF GUN CONTROL, CAN'T BE SOLVED BY CONGRESS\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"What if there was a mass shooting in the United States not once or twice or four or six times monthly, but every single day, a big one, the kind that electrifies social media and squats for days on Page 1 \u2014 would that be enough to move Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from his insistent inertia on gun safety?\" the board asked.\n\n\"Would any volume of bloodshed convince the Kentucky Republican that Congress faces a moral imperative to act?\"", "description": "Following increased calls from the media for further gun control measures, the Washington Post editorial board singled out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in a Tuesday op-ed, and called on him to ban assault weapons, claiming it would save lives.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
