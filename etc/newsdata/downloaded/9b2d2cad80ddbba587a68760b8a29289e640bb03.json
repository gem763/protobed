The rebound fell kindly to Jovic, but the striker blazed over from six yards.\n\nKroos sent a blistering effort flashing past the post before Vinicius broke the deadlock when his shot from the edge of the box took a touch off Navas and sailed into the top-right corner, the Brazilian almost reduced to tears.\n\nJovic was unable to punish a defensive lapse from Osasuna within five minutes of the restart and he had a goal correctly disallowed for offside upon review before the hour mark.\n\nStory continues\n\nVinicius made way for 18-year-old Brazilian Rodrygo and in the 72nd minute he jinked in from the left, beat Lillo and curled a great finish into the bottom-right corner to consign Osasuna to their first defeat of the season.\n\nWhat does it mean? Zidane keeps stars fresh\n\nBy resting his first choice attacking trio of Eden Hazard, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, Zidane will be feeling positive ahead of the trip to the Wanda Metropolitano.\n\nThibaut Courtois, Raphael Varane and Dani Carvajal were unused substitutes, while James Rodriguez only played eight minutes off the bench.\n\nRodrygo makes instant impact\n\nRodrygo was expected to split his time between the first team and Castilla this season, but Zidane may be keen to keep him around after a stellar cameo sealed victory for Madrid.\n\nJovic fails to step up\n\nWith Benzema having scored five goals in his past five LaLiga appearances, chances for Jovic to lead the Madrid attack are going to be limited for the foreseeable future. The Serbian was unable to take the chances that came his way and can expect a swift return to the bench.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nZidane's side meet Atletico in El Derbi on Saturday and Osasuna travel to Levante the following day.", "description": "Rodrygo Goes scored less than two minutes into his Real Madrid debut, capping a defeat of Osasuna that Vinicius Junior set in motion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UGqdbo.WGnVvz8CNqImccA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yaCGp0CGArwrHaQflsyGmg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/94adee4ef473d4696c909fdbf637027f", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
