Why not go all out to win it? You only get three opportunities (a season) if you're not in Europe.\n\n(Image: 2019 Aston Villa FC)\n\n\"You enter three competitions and the title probably slipped away from us on Saturday so we have the Carabao Cup and FA Cup to fight for.\n\n\"We want to finish as high as we can but this is a priority as well. We have a proud history in this cup, we've won it five times, and want to continue to win it more and have days like we had in May at Wembley.\n\n\"There's still a long way to go but it was a deserved victory.\"\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\nEl Ghazi fired Villa ahead after 29 minutes when John Ruddy just failed to keep his low drive out.\n\nVilla dominated but were stunned when Cutrone turned in Taylor Perry's shot nine minutes after the break.\n\nIt was just the striker's second goal in 17 games since his summer arrival from AC Milan but it was cancelled out three minutes later with Elmohamady's winner.\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\nThe full-back got ahead of Bruno Jordao to stab in Henri Lansbury's near-post free-kick for his third Villa goal and first in over a year.\n\nWolves never looked like recovering but, despite defeat, boss Nuno Espirito Santo was satisfied with his young team.\n\nThe manager rested several established stars for Wolves' 21st game of the season as they continue to compete in Europe and the Premier League.\n\nChem Campbell, 16, became the club's second youngest player while teenagers Dion Sanderson and Taylor Perry were given their full debuts.\n\nNuno said: \"It was a tough game, Villa are a good team, we know Dean, he has good ideas and it was hard. We managed well, we stuck to our shape and we balanced ourselves. We had our moments.\n\n\"The young players competed and gave everything, you have to give everything you've got.\n\n\"It's a building process. Since the beginning we've tried to give competition to the young boys.\n\n\"We tried to mix experience and talent. Their families should be proud, they are good lads.\"", "description": "ASTON VILLA 2-1 WOLVES: Villa boss Dean Smith is eyeing Carabao Cup glory after seeing off local rivals Wolves", "authors": ["Nick Mashiter", "Press Association", "Image", "Aston Villa Fc", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761157.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Aston-Villa-v-Wolverhampton-Wanderers-Carabao-Cup-Round-of-16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
