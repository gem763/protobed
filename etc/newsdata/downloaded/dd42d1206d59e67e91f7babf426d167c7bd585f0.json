The group, called To The Stars Academy, has reportedly signed a deal with the U.S. Army to help the military study and develop advanced materials aimed at producing \u201cactive camouflage, beamed energy propulsion, and quantum communication\u201d to be used in military vehicles.\n\nTo the Stars joined the Army\u2019s Combat Capabilities Development Command on October 17 and will officially be working with the U.S. military to develop futuristic tech. To the Stars is most notable for the group\u2019s various claims about UFO\u2019s, including its alleged acquisition of \u201cexotic\u201d materials that are said to be from another planet and a recent video acquired from the Navy that supposedly shows a UFO flying in front of jet fighters.\n\nThe military is reportedly interested in studying the following areas with Delonge\u2019s organization, according to Vice News:\n\ninertial mass reduction (a type of far-future propulsion)\n\nmechanical/structural meta materials\n\nelectromagnetic meta material wave guides\n\nquantum physics\n\nactive camouflage\n\nquantum communications\n\nbeamed energy propulsion\n\nTo The Stars\u2019 contract with the military doesn\u2019t specifically mention the \u201cexotic\u201d metals that the group has recently obtained, but does mention that U.S. Army will be using government labs to study \u201cmeta materials.\u201d The contract states:\n\nGovernment shall: Perform assessments, testing, and characterization of Collaborator-provided technologies. The Government is interested in a variety of the Collaborator\u2019s technologies, such as, but not limited to inertial mass reduction, mechanical/structural meta materials, electromagnetic meta material wave guides, quantum physics, quantum communications, and beamed energy propulsion.\n\nThe contract lasts for five years and the U.S. Army is not paying To The Stars Academy anything directly, but is instead agreeing to collaborate with the group on research and has committed to spend $750,000 on that work.\n\nDr. Joseph Cannon, Deputy Product Manager of Science and Technology in the Vehicle Protection Systems Division of the GVSC, stated in the press release that \u201cour partnership with TTSA serves as an exciting, non-traditional source for novel materials and transformational technologies to enhance our military ground system capabilities. At the Army\u2019s Ground Vehicle Systems Center, we look forward to this partnership and the potential technical innovations forthcoming.\u201d\n\nRead more at VICE News here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
