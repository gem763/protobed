Itau and Banco do Brasil didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment while BTG declined to do so.\n\nRegis Bittencourt, which owns a concession to operate 403 kilometers (250 miles) of a highway linking Sao Paulo with Curitiba until 2033, will look to sell a first tranche of 1 billion reais maturing in 2031 that will pay inflation (IPCA) plus margin and a second tranche of 700 million reais coming due in 2027 at the inter-banking rate per one day (CDI) plus a margin. Margins will be determined after a book building auction.\n\nThe company will use proceeds from the sale to refinance debt and for capital expenditures. Regis has 921 million reais in loans maturing in 2023 and 2024.\n\nRecord Nearly Secured\n\nThe banks have told Regis that the second tranche could price at around CDI plus 1.1%, two of the people said. Arteris SA, the holding company that controls the toll operator, did its homework in August after getting its ratings raised by S&P Global Ratings. Spain\u2019s Abertis SA controls Arteris while financial services provider Brookfield Aylesbury SARL holds a minority stake.\n\nRegis\u2019 offering would come as Brazil\u2019s local bond market is booming. Investors have been shifting to corporate bonds as rates on government debt fall to new lows. The decrease in government borrowing costs has propelled 134 billion reais of notes issued by companies so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nA robust pipeline of debt deals in the works will add to what\u2019s already been sold this year, setting up the Brazilian corporate bond market to easily surpass 2018\u2019s record of 135 billion reais. At least another 5.3 billion reais in bonds issued by toll-road operators will come to market before December, according to the people.\n\nAmong those deals, Rota das Bandeiras plans to sell as much as 2.4 billion reais in mid-November, led mostly by BTG, with XP Investimentos SA and Banco ABC Brazil SA handling a quarter of the deal, according to a filing made last week. Ecorodovias Concessoes e Servicos SA intends to issue 230 million reais of bonds next month, according to an Oct. 1 board meeting filing. Meanwhile, two units of CCR SA have mandated Banco Bradesco SA to offer 1.7 billion reais of notes, the people said. CCR and Bradesco declined to comment.\n\nThe Benetton family operates more than 3,400 kilometers of toll motorway in Brazil. It controls Atlantia SpA, which completed its acquisition of Abertis in October of last year. Atlantia manages 14,000 kilometers of toll roads in Europe, the Americas and India, according to its website.", "description": "Benetton Unit Hires Banks for $408 Million Bond Sale in Brazil", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc5d0a7c336b22c2a474ed4a8898ae6e0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
