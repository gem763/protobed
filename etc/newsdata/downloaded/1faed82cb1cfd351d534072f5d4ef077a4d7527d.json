Now his custody fight has reached the governor\u2019s office.", "language": "en", "text": "At least one of those conflicts was resolved on Tuesday, as a jury in Dallas effectively granted Georgulas sole custody of Luna in a deeply personal case of gender identity, family conflict and viral misinformation that has lit conservative circles aflame.\n\nAD\n\nSince the start of the trial last week, a number of conservative media outlets have cried foul about the situation, claiming that Georgulas, a pediatrician with a private practice in a Dallas suburb, was going to have Luna \u201cmutilated\u201d or \u201cchemically castrated.\u201d The case even made its way to at least three Texas Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz, who called the child \u201ca pawn in a left-wing political agenda.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (R), meanwhile, said late on Wednesday that state agencies were looking into the situation. Neither office immediately responded to a request for comment. Attorneys for both parents also did not immediately respond.\n\nFYI the matter of 7 year old James Younger is being looked into by the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. #JamesYounger \u2014 Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) October 23, 2019\n\nBut as Younger turned the parents\u2019 fight into one over irreversible medical procedures, experts on health care for transgender children told The Washington Post that Georgulas\u2019s approach to the child would not involve any kind of surgery or hormones for years.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMany people wrongly assume that prepubescent transgender or gender-diverse children will receive medical interventions,\u201d Katherine Kuvalanka, a social work professor at Miami University in Ohio, said in an email to The Washington Post. \u201cThe only interventions for young children is affirmation and acceptance for who they are.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn its 11-to-1 decision, a jury all but gave Georgulas the right to sign off on any medical and psychological decisions. If a judge upholds that decision on Thursday, the verdict would end a bitter, two-year saga between the parents, who had their brief marriage annulled over their child\u2019s gender identity, a case that wades deep into thorny, polarized and little-known questions about the impact of medical transitions on young children.\n\nIt all began, Younger says on his blog, on the twins\u2019 third birthday, when Luna expressed a desire to be a girl.\n\nAD\n\nAt that point, the father was paying maximum child support and had standard custody in Texas: He saw the twins once a week for two hours and had them sleep over at his apartment two weekends a month. They spent the rest of their time with Georgulas, who had noticed that the child, known by the name James at the time, wanted to wear dresses and look like the female characters from the Disney movie \u201cFrozen.\"\n\nAD\n\nGeorgulas took Luna to see a therapist, who diagnosed the child with gender dysphoria \u2014 a mismatch between the gender assigned at birth and the one they identified with. From there, the therapist laid out steps on how to make the child feel affirmed, like letting Luna paint their nails and putting them in a dress, as the mother did when the twins turned 5.\n\nBut Younger has repeatedly told a different story in interviews with conservative media outlets, including LifeSiteNews, a website run by a Canadian antiabortion organization that advocates for \u201ctraditional family values\u201d and against same-sex marriage.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJames presents as a boy with me and he presents as a girl with his mom,\u201d Younger said to the website last month. \u201cHe gets dressed as a boy at his mother\u2019s home and he comes out to me as a boy. That means that he\u2019s comfortable as a boy at his mother\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nYounger charged that Georgulas had been pressuring Luna to want to use female pronouns. He cut the child\u2019s hair, put the child in boys\u2019 clothes and continued calling them James.\n\nIn August 2018, Georgulas filed for a restraining order to block Younger from entering the twins\u2019 school or telling other parents or students \u201cthat the gender of Luna is different than a girl named Luna.\u201d\n\nShe also tried to enroll their child in gender transition therapy at GENECIS, a pediatric clinic for transgender children in Dallas and the first one like it in the Southwest. (Representatives for the clinic did not immediately answer a request for comment on Wednesday night.)\n\nAD\n\nBut Laura Edwards-Leeper, a clinical psychologist at Pacific University, said that for someone of Luna\u2019s age, gender-affirming care would not include any kind of medical intervention until they hit puberty. Even then, she said, it\u2019s not an automatic procedure.\n\nAD\n\nAfter a mental-health evaluation and discussion with parents, it might encompass a range of activities to help \u201cthe child to live as their authentic gender, and with their preferred gender expression, at any given point in time, without a presumption about their future gender identity,\u201d she said.\n\nFor a 7-year-old, that might mean speaking to experts and potentially helping them through a social transition, which might include changing their clothes, hairstyle or pronouns. At around ages 10 to 13, parents, health professionals and the child might decide to take puberty blockers, which delay the development of secondary sex characteristics, like facial hair or breasts.\n\nAD\n\nThose can be stopped at any time, and puberty continues as it would normally. \u201cIt is only irreversible if the adults in the child\u2019s life make it irreversible,\u201d Edwards-Leeper told The Post. \u201cIf the adults can stay open to whatever trajectory the child has, then it\u2019s completely reversible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nYounger, however, said that a tactic of \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d would be more prudent for Luna instead. Because he still had custody, his objections meant that the clinic said it could not take Luna on as a client, LifeSiteNews and other outlets reported.\n\nKuvalanka, however, said the \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d approach can be harmful when a parent is withholding acceptance, and that tactic has been deemed \u201coutdated\u201d by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nAD\n\nAround the time she filed the restraining order, Georgulas also tried to alter the terms of what is essentially Texas\u2019s version of joint custody. She wanted Younger to affirm the child\u2019s gender identity, requiring him to call her Luna and use female pronouns, and prevent him from making them spend time with those who did otherwise.\n\nIn response, Younger made a request of his own: a petition for full custody over the twins. Launching an Internet campaign to #ProtectJamesYounger, which was shared by Cruz and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.), he argued that Georgulas was going to force the child to undergo \u201cchemical castration\u201d once the 7-year-old became old enough to transition.\n\nAD\n\nAnd he stepped up his calls. In January, on a podcast with a Texas political operative, he described talking with the child on FaceTime, accusing Georgulas of having \u201cdressed him as a drag queen,\u201d with fake eyelashes, makeup and hair covered in glitter.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is not just emotional abuse but is the very, most fundamental form of sexual abuse, tampering with the sexual identity of a vulnerable boy,\u201d the father said.\n\nA 7-year-old child doesn't have the maturity to make profound decisions like this. The state of Texas should protect this child's right to choose\u2014as an informed, mature person\u2014and not be used as a pawn in a left-wing political agenda. #ProtectJamesYounger \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) October 24, 2019\n\nThis is heartbreaking and sets a horrible precedent.\n\n\n\nA 7-year-old can\u2019t possibly make this decision or understand it. Parents should know better. I hope this father receives the public support he needs. #ProtectJamesYoungerhttps://t.co/4hszPgqGWe \u2014 Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) October 22, 2019\n\nThe judgment effectively giving the mother sole custody of the twins was unusual, Kuvalanka said, given that juries and judges tend to side with parents who repress a child\u2019s gender identity. But the victory has come with a cost.\n\nGeorgulas\u2019s attorneys said the mother has faced threats, harassment, and vandalism, having been \u201cviciously attacked and threatened by complete strangers,\u201d they said in a statement to the Daily Caller, \u201cbased on false and untrue statements.\u201d", "description": "The mother is likely to receive full custody of their 7-year-old twins, one of whom she says is transgender.
