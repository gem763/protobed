To make salad, romaine is grown, chopped, washed, and drizzled in olive oil,\u201d Sam explains (they both go under a pseudonym to separate their various lines of work). Meals looks to bake food culture into apparel, blurring the lines between the clothes we eat and the food we wear.\n\n\n\nMeals\u2019 slogan is \u201cWear What You Eat\u201d and their first collection brings this to life through a combination of workwear shapes (using dead stock or vintage materials) and colorful patterns from watermelons, shrimps, bananas, and grape soda. The designs are gender neutral because \u201ceverybody eats and everybody wears clothes\u201d and the large pockets double as storage when shopping at the market. \u201cI always forget to bring bags to the grocery store,\u201d Rebma explains.\n\nRebma helms the visual side of the brand and Sam handles the voice and tone, with a background in garment production. They both decided to use pseudonyms \u201cbecause they\u2019re fun\u201d but also to create more of a boundary with their other work. i-D spoke to the food enthusiasts about coming up with a brand idea while high, how to confuse food and fashion, and what they like to eat.\n\nTell me a bit about both of your backgrounds.\n\nSam:I grew up in a household where food was everything. My mom\u2019s an exceptional baker, and was always painting still lifes of fruit. Rebma has a long, rich relationship with fantasy, of building worlds, and they\u2019ve held onto that since they were little.\n\nHave you always been creative?\n\nS: Rebma is the formerly anonymous creative force behind the cult denim brand 69. I\u2019m a writer with a background in apparel production. Rebma\u2019s education really came from working in a magazine archive, and everything I know comes from the Simpsons.\n\nHow did you meet and decide to create a brand together?\n\nS: I went to a 69 sample sale and flirted with Remba. I bought a very sheer skirt and returned it so I could flirt more. Then we went to Disneyland for our first date. The idea for Meals came when I picked Remba up from the airport; we recently started smoking pot, and got the \u2018high-dea\u2019 for Meals on our way to dinner.\n\nWhy food?\n\nS: 2019 prizes experiences over objects. We\u2019re living in an age of pop-ups, activations, and selfie-centric museums. Food is an experience too. Meals infuses the experience of food into fashion, and vice versa\u2014through language, imagery, and merchandising, we\u2019re trying to completely confuse the two.\n\nWhat do you think appeals to people about combining food and clothing?\n\nRebma: It\u2019s a weird concept, but it\u2019s very literal. For us, it was about combining two things (food and clothes) that bring us joy, and that really resonates with people.\n\nWhy did you choose to use deadstock or vintage materials?\n\nR: A lot of the fabric we use is slightly defective. Just because an apple has a bruise doesn\u2019t mean you throw it out. As for dead-stock fabric, there\u2019s a wonderful scarcity to it. Once it\u2019s gone, you\u2019ll probably never see it again.\n\nAre you both foodies? What are your favorite meals?\n\nS: Rebma likes the plant-based burger at Monty\u2019s in K-town. We go there when we\u2019re celebrating. We\u2019ll probably go get one when this piece comes out. I\u2019m currently obsessed with Korean fish cake soup, and there\u2019s a good version at this sports bar near us called OB Bear.\n\nWhat are your plans for the future of the brand?\n\nR: We want to keep developing insane washes and meeting chefs and eating cool food. We\u2019re hosting a Thanksgiving dinner at our studio with our friend, the food artist, Nunchi. She\u2019s figuring out how to put an entire Thanksgiving dinner in a go-gurt tube.", "description": "Meals blurs the line between food and fashion with their workwear silhouettes and tasty prints.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db84f42aea98c00927b2983/lede/1572372780235-_MG_7031.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8427xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
