Following breakthrough records, acts including Mitski, St. Vincent and Vampire Weekend teamed with high-profile collaborators and tested mainstream waters. Such moves aren\u2019t hard to fathom\u2014it\u2019s a challenge to give your music a new shape and try for new listeners. But there\u2019s something to be said for the bold aesthetic left-turn that comes out of nowhere, a move that seems to satisfy a creative need more than a commercial one.\n\n\u201cAll Mirrors,\u201d the fourth album from Angel Olsen, out Oct. 4 on Jagjaguwar, is such a work. The singer and songwriter\u2019s last collection of new material, the acclaimed 2016 set \u201cMy Woman,\u201d would seem to have positioned her nicely for broader success. While lo-fi folk and creaky countrified rock defined her early music, \u201cMy Woman\u201d had propulsive hooks and a sparkling pop sheen. And earlier this year, Ms. Olsen appeared on \u201cTrue Blue,\u201d a terrific collaboration with Mark Ronson from the noted producer\u2019s recent LP, which nearly sounded ready for radio.\n\nBut \u201cAll Mirrors\u201d is something else entirely\u2014a challenging and intense art-pop offering unconcerned with trends. Produced by Ms. Olsen and John Congleton, who worked with her on 2014\u2019s \u201cBurn Your Fire for No Witness,\u201d the record\u2019s defining characteristic is the strings that dominate the mix and seem to cover her voice in a dark mist. The tension between her distinctive tone and the glissando-rich arrangements by Ben Babbitt and Jherek Bischoff brings to mind ambitiously orchestrated albums by artists like Radiohead, Kate Bush and Mercury Rev, and Ms. Olsen makes the most of the grand setting.\n\n\u201cLark\u201d begins the record with a cluster of dissonance, as if tuning up for what\u2019s to come, and Ms. Olsen then enters in her quietest vocal mode, a hushed tone that hints at the potential for violence. Experience with her dynamic song structures suggests the muted opening will give way to a dramatic peak, but when it does the sheer intensity of the explosion is still shocking. \u201cHiding out inside my head it\u2019s me again it\u2019s no surprise I\u2019m on my own now,\u201d she sings over pounding drums, her urgency amplified by the dozen instruments surrounding her.\n\nMs. Olsen approaches singing almost like an actor, with a new tone to pair with each emotional development. On \u201cImpasse,\u201d she sounds drugged and wounded before coming to life later in the song, and a similar feeling of desolation marks the vocal on \u201cTonight,\u201d on which she sings of forgetting about a lover to find herself. While the lyrics throughout the album aren\u2019t especially quotable and don\u2019t jump off the page, they work beautifully in context, each vowel and consonant articulated for maximum effect. \u201cSpring\u201d is a nice example of Ms. Olsen\u2019s phrasing mastery, as she sings \u201cShow me a love that won\u2019t ever leave / Or look to another one to deceive,\u201d the stress on the middle syllable of \u201canother\u201d adding a twist of anticipation.\n\nA few tunes hint at atmospheric dream-pop, and suggest a road not taken. With some adjustments, the title track could have been a percolating dance-pop number, but Ms. Olsen slows it down and draws it out, allowing its observations about growing old and losing your sense of self to sink deeper. \u201cNew Love Cassette\u201d begins with a wobbly synth bass and Ms. Olsen singing in her lower register, as if directly into your ear, and for a moment suggests something like a slow-burn LCD Soundsystem ballad. But then it gets weirder as it goes, with fierce double-bass flourishes and a drone that fills the song like water seeping into a ship.\n\nThe album droops slightly in its final quarter\u2014\u201cSummer\u201d and \u201cEndgame\u201d are in line with the other songs tonally, but aren\u2019t as powerful as what came before\u2014until it ends on a strong note with \u201cChance.\u201d Here, the strings have moved from fraught expressionism to an arrangement that evokes the twinkling childlike wonder of a midcentury Disney score, and as if emerging from a dark cave and stepping into the light.\n\n\u201cAll Mirrors\u201d is not an easy album to listen to\u2014it doesn\u2019t lend itself to passive consumption. You have to absorb it on its own terms or not at all, and that\u2019s exciting. Ms. Olsen has said she\u2019ll release the songs from \u201cAll Mirrors\u201d in another format next year with just her voice and guitar. It\u2019s hard to say how this minimalist approach will work given the overwhelming nature of the sonics here, but it\u2019s an intriguing thought that underscores her adventurousness and willingness to surprise.\n\n\u2014Mr. Richardson is the Journal\u2019s rock and pop music critic.
