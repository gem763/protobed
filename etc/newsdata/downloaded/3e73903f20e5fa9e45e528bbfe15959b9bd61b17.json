(Jacqueline Larma/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see, it\u2019s really funny, Mom,\u201d my tween told me as he hit play on one of his favorite new shows, which sounded like the desperate tale of a Depression-era coal miner.\n\nIt\u2019s about a worker who has no job security, who struggles with dangerous work conditions and is trapped on the lower rungs of an economy driven by corporate greed.\n\nBut \u201cLiza on Demand\u201d is set in 2019 Los Angeles, it\u2019s on YouTube and it\u2019s the best indictment of the stupid, impossible world America has created for its working class.\n\nLiza works in the gig economy \u2014 driving for Uber, hiring herself out as a mover or a cookie-maker. It\u2019s labeled as \u201cgig economy comedy,\u201d but get past the campy jokes and her Lucille Ball misadventures and it\u2019s a startling call to action for a renewed and fierce labor movement in a nation where a steady job with decent benefits is becoming a unicorn.\n\nThis Labor Day weekend, after we\u2019re done planning the picnic and the best route around the holiday traffic, let\u2019s take a moment to see where the American worker ranks in today\u2019s economy.\n\nIt was 150 years ago this year \u2014 in 1869 \u2014 that some Philadelphia tailors came up with radical, utopian ideas about what it should be like to work in our post-Civil War nation: an eight-hour workday. Equal pay for equal work for both sexes. A proper share of the wealth the work has created.\n\nThose were some of the goals of the Knights of Labor, a secret society that was essentially the nation\u2019s first labor organization.\n\n\u201cThe recent alarming development and aggression of aggregated wealth, which, unless checked, will invariably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses, render it imperative, if we desire to enjoy the blessings of life, that a check should be placed upon its power and upon unjust accumulation,\u201d began the preamble of the Knights.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThe Knights faded away, but they began a movement that\u2019s just as crucial today as it was in 1869.\n\nThe federal minimum wage stands at poverty level, $7.25 an hour.\n\nWe\u2019re nowhere near equal pay for women and men.\n\nAnd although the number is hard to pin down, a recent Gallup survey found that more than a third of the American workforce has been swallowed up by the gig economy. That\u2019s a lot of free agents with few or no safety nets out there.\n\nRight here in Washington, it\u2019s clear that what was once the safest, most stable and cautious place for the super-safe worker to join \u2014 the federal workforce \u2014 is a precarious gamble.\n\n[Federal workers return to their jobs uneasy and anxious]\n\nThis year, we saw the steak-and-cocktail Capitol Hill crowd use workers as political footballs in the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Workers from diplomats to security guards went 35 days without pay. Almost forgot about that, didn\u2019t you?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to food banks. I am going to McDonald\u2019s trying to apply for a job. I\u2019m going everywhere, I don\u2019t even have a watch because I went to the pawnshop giving my jewelry away just to make ends meet, and I have my rent coming up and I have no money to pay for it,\u201d Faye Smith, a security guard at the Smithsonian, said during the shutdown in January.\n\nGoFundMe was filled with proud workers such as Smith explaining how ashamed they were to ask for $10 or $20 donations to help pay mortgage, college tuition or medical expenses when their paychecks stopped coming at a time in their lives when they were vulnerable. Smith received a lot of donations after her story appeared on local TV. At least 1,000 other workers got zero, their tales of woe and dead fundraising accounts haunting the Internet.\n\nThe folks who passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, a law that forbids federal workers from striking, apparently didn\u2019t envision a Congress that would abuse the shutdown as often as our elected officials abuse it today.\n\n[Selling their stuff, walking dogs \u2014 the federal worker side hustle for survival]\n\nA lot of the federal workers survived with a side hustle \u2014 the gig economy. And this may be a huge part of their future as this administration makes more moves to shrink the federal workforce.\n\nWhen it comes to the gig economy, there are plenty of discussions about whether folks like Liza should be able to demand better working conditions. Darn straight we need to pay attention to Liza.\n\nOut West, eight out of 10 Uber drivers who talked to professors studying this at the University of California at Los Angeles told them that heck yeah, they\u2019d like some protection.\n\nDon\u2019t turn off on this, because it\u2019s a lot more than Uber drivers who are part of this new age of labor rights discussion.\n\nThe folks at the National Bureau of Economic Research conducted a massive study on the gig economy that came up with the startling conclusion that \u201c94 percent of the net employment growth in the U.S. economy from 2005 to 2015 appears to have occurred in alternative work arrangements.\u201d\n\nThat means most of the new jobs out there now \u2014 and the jobs many of our kids will have \u2014 are gigs, whether they\u2019re analysts, coders or dog walkers.\n\nTime to start thinking again about what the Knights demanded 150 years ago.\n\nTwitter: @petulad", "description": "On Labor Day weekend, watch this YouTube comedy about just how awful the world of work has become for millions of Americans.
