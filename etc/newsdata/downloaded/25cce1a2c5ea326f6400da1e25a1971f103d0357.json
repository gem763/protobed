They\u2019re thoughtfully sculptural (Mlouye\u2019s founder, Meb Rure, has a background in architecture and furniture design), whimsical, and surprisingly lightweight for a handbag constructed out of Italian vegetable tanned leather. Now, the luxury handbag label is teaming up with British ready-to-wear brand Whistles for a special collaboration that will bring Mlouye to the U.K. for the first time.\n\nThe partnership includes six new takes on Mlouye classics like the signature lantern shape, now specially finished in croc-embossed leather. A few new styles will also be introduced, such as the Bonita \u2014 a cute little bag with a large handle that\u2019s weirdly satisfying to hold. Prices range from $325 for the belt bag to $545 for the Helix bags.\n\nThe Mlouye x Whistles collection will drop in Whistle\u2019s Soho store and on its website next Wednesday, but if the anticipation is killing you, Cut readers can get an hour head start to shop the bags via an exclusive link.
