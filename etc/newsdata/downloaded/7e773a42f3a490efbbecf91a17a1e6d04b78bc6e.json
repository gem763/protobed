Trump reportedly promised to get the theocratic monarchy into the G7\n\n'Phone calls that were embarrassing, huge mistakes he made, months and months of work that were upended by one impulsive tweet.'\n\nThe report also details two of Trump's calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin, claiming that Trump warmly praised the authoritarian leader in one of the first calls of his presidency, and later called to quiz Putin on advice for forging a relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nIt comes as Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky continues to fuel a political firestorm, with an impeachment inquiry probing Trump's request that the Ukraine investigate possible corruption involving Biden's son.\n\nTrump is seething over an impeachment inquiry into his conduct after Democrats subpoenaed the White House about contacts with Ukraine and he signaled his administration would not cooperate.\n\nA U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules cargo plane is seen in a file photo.

Mitt Romney, R-Utah.\n\n'This is a fraud against the American people!' he tweeted.\n\nThe inquiry reached deeper into the White House when the House sent a letter Friday to Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, informing him that the White House was being subpoenaed for documents it had refused to produce. The move capped a tumultuous week that widened the constitutional battle between the executive branch and Congress and heightened the political standoff with more witnesses, testimony and documents to come.\n\nTrump received support from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who dismissed questions about Trump's attempts to push Ukraine and China to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden as a 'silly gotcha game.'\n\n'The president has every right to have these set of conversations,' Pompeo told reporters while traveling in Greece. He insisted the administration's foreign efforts were reasonable, responsible and necessary to target graft, ensure aid is spent properly and protect American democracy.", "description": "In one call with Saudi officials, Trump vowed that he would help the theocratic country join the G7 group of leading industrial democracies, according to the Washington Post .", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/18/19337804-0-image-a-10_1570295173244.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
