In this paradise, there\u2019s never a shortage of things to do, and the state\u2019s carefree approach to life makes each day a bit more cheerful.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of moving to Florida (and aren\u2019t we all?), check out our rundown of everything you need to know before you go \u2014 from job prospects to weather to cost of living.\n\nFlorida weather\n\nWhen you think of Florida, you probably think \u201cconstant sunshine,\u201d and while there\u2019s a lot of truth to that, the state is large and the weather in Florida is a bit more complicated than its nickname implies. Most of Florida has a subtropical climate, meaning much of the state experiences mild weather throughout the winter, though some northern communities do experience short, mild cold snaps.\n\nSummers are hot, sunny and humid. Regular rainstorms are a hallmark of Florida summers, but the storms here rarely last longer than 45 minutes.\n\nCities in Florida\n\nFlorida has countless beautiful beachside towns to choose from, but it also offers a slice of city life, and central Florida features a taste of quieter country living. City lovers can find a fast-paced, cosmopolitan lifestyle in Miami or a growing creative culture in St. Petersburg.\n\nSarasota offers outdoor activities like fishing and kayaking, and is home to a great culinary and cultural scene. Gainesville, a city that consistently lands a spot on Livability\u2019s annual ranking of the Top 100 Best Places to Live, is home to the University of Florida and provides a fun and youthful college town atmosphere.\n\nFlorida\u2019s northeast coast provides a flashback to \u201cOld Florida,\u201d with midcentury architecture and history dating back to the 1500s. The state\u2019s panhandle and western gulf coast are home to some of the most pristine, postcard-perfect beaches in the country, while the Florida Keys feel like a 24/7 vacation.\n\nAlso see: Where\u2019s the best place for me to retire?\n\nMost notably?

Paddleboarding, kayaking, fishing, golf and swimming are always in season. Of course, Walt Disney World and Universal Studios Orlando are always great options for fun as well. Universal\u2019s Harry Potter World has become a bucket list item for fans of the book series, and the Magic Kingdom is a fantastic way to spend a day.\n\nFlorida jobs\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, one of Florida\u2019s biggest employers is Walt Disney World DIS, +0.36% . Another major Florida employer is the local public school system, as well as the health care industry.

Some of the most big Florida agricultural products include oranges, dairy, sugar cane and tomatoes. Florida is also home to top aviation companies and a thriving export industry, and it serves as a biomedical research hub, thanks to the many colleges and universities that call the state home.\n\nFlorida colleges and universities\n\nSome of Florida\u2019s largest universities include the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida State University in Tallahassee, University of Central Florida in Orlando, and the University of Miami. The sunny climate makes for a vibrant college experience, and Florida\u2019s appealing in-state tuition options for public school attendees help attract great students. Students at UF and FSU love football, and each fall thousands of fans descend on the campuses to tailgate and cheer on their home team. Ready to join them?\n\nHow to get around\n\nYou\u2019ll need a car to get around the majority of Florida. Major highways like 75 and 95 crisscross the state, but striking bridges like the Sunshine Skyway, the Seven-Mile Bridge, and the Bridge of Lions will keep you captivated if you\u2019re stuck in traffic. One the more scenic drives is A1A, a road that runs along the east coast of the state all the way to Key West and crosses through countless beautiful beach towns (not to mention Daytona!). On A1A, you\u2019ll find ocean views outside your car window for most of the drive.
