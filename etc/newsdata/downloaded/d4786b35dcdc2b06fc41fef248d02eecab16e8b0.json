So, we've got really good players, we need more than three.\n\n\"I've always said that in tournaments that I played in, we always pinned our hopes on one player or two players.\n\n\"Then there was an injury, a drama and a crisis and you need players to be able to start games and you need players who are able to come on and make a difference in games.\n\n\"So, I don't think it matters what our starting three is. Clearly, at the moment Raheem and Harry, their numbers are incredible and the consistency of their performance is, but the rest can be down to performance at any given time.\n\n\"And how we see the guys in training and their physical level. These guys know that Tammy coming through is going to push that. Callum Wilson is going to want to push - we can try to motivate the players but that competition for places is as much as a driver than anything else.\"", "description": "Follow live coverage of England\u00a0vs Czech Republic\u00a0in the Euro 2020 qualifier in Prague.
