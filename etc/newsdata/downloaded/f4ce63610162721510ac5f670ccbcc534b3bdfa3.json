Something awful could happen and I'll be gone in in a flash or I could live to be in my 60s.'\n\nVicki (after her chemotherapy treatment) was first told she had the disease at the age of 21 in November 2016, and underwent a double mastectomy and six rounds of chemotherapy before her treatment ended in June 2017\n\nBut at a routine check up on February 20 this year, medics found another lump where the cancer had been before. Pictured: Vicki with her husband Simon on their wedding day\n\nVicki first found a lump in her left breast as she showered in November 2016 and was given an emergency referral to Hertfordshire's St Albans City Hospital by her GP for a biopsy, before being diagnosed with grade three breast cancer.\n\nShe recalled: 'My mother was with me and while I was totally shocked, I think she'd had her suspicions. Still, we both just cried and cried and cried.'\n\nOn December 8, 2016, Vicki had a double mastectomy to stop the cancer from spreading to the other breast - an operation only performed on 50 women under 30 a year in the UK, according to the NHS.\n\nAfter her operation and reconstructive surgery at north west London's Royal Free Hospital, Vicki - who has no family history of breast cancer - also had six rounds of chemotherapy and was given hormone repression treatment, to 'kill anything floating around.'\n\nBefore her diagnosis, after turning 21 in the January, 2016 looked set to be the best year of her life.\n\nVicki (seen above during her big day) is one of only 31 people under 24 to be diagnosed with the disease each year in Britain, according to Cancer Research UK\n\nVicki, seen during her treatment, first found a lump in her left breast as she showered in November 2016\n\nShe met Simon in the unlikely setting of her nail technician mother, Helen's, 50th H-themed fancy dress birthday party on July 23 at Hertfordshire's Chipperfield Cricket Club.\n\nHe was having some drinks after playing cricket with pals and Vicki - dressed as a Hell's Angel - got talking to him after her mother, in a Helen of Troy costume, played matchmaker.\n\nThey enjoyed a magical courtship until November, when she found the lump.\n\nShe said: 'We were getting ready to go out and I'd just had a shower and I remember watching a video that advised women to check our breasts in the shower.\n\n'When I felt mine, I found a lump. I showed Simon and he told me to talk to my mother, which I did.'\n\nThe HR auditor (seen with her husband) was given an emergency referral to Hertfordshire's St Albans City Hospital by her GP for a biopsy, before being diagnosed with grade three breast cancer\n\nVicki met Simon (pictured together) in the unlikely setting of her nail technician mother, Helen's, 50th birthday party at Hertfordshire's Chipperfield Cricket Club in 2016\n\nFrom there, things moved swiftly, leading to her diagnosis, surgery, a sadly unsuccessful attempt to harvest her eggs, hoping she could have IVF in the future and finally chemotherapy, which ended in June 2017.\n\nKeen to celebrate her treatment ending, she and Simon then spent six months travelling across Southeast Asia.\n\nDiagnosed with a Wilms' tumour when she was three - a type of kidney cancer, affecting about 70 children under the age of five each year in the UK, with a 90 per cent survival rate, according to the NHS - Vicki was used to showing resilience.\n\n'At primary school I was bald as an egg because of chemo,' she said. 'The kids in my year looked after me, but I remember getting called a boy a lot by older kids, which at that age isn't very fun.'\n\nAnd her past experience helped her to cope when, at a routine check up on February 20 this year, doctors found another lump where the cancer had been before.\n\nSimon asked Vicki (pictured together) to marry him after doctors found the second lump on her breast in February this year\n\nDoctors said they had seen 'a speck' on four of her spinal vertebrae and confirmed that Vicki (pictured during treatment) now had stage four breast cancer and that the spinal tumours were inoperable\n\nShe said: 'It grew between the skin and the silicon and saline implant, so I could feel it below the nipple.'\n\nBut a biopsy on February 26 led to catastrophic news. 'A nurse asked me to come into the hospital and I thought \"I don't like this\"', Vicki said.\n\n'I asked why and made them tell me on the phone. Something in me wanted to hear it and my first question was, \"am I going to die?\",\n\n'I just didn't think it was my turn to go through it all again. I had thought that it might come back, but not until I was 30 or older.'\n\nAs Vicki and her family prepared for yet another battle, Simon asked her to be his wife.\n\nShe said: 'Simon proposed on March 19. I'm a massive Anne Boleyn fan and he proposed in the chapel of the Tower of London where her body was buried.'\n\nVicki (pictured on vacation with Simon) is currently on a course of oral chemotherapy medication, that she takes daily every three weeks - with a week off in between - to stop the cancer from spreading any further\n\nDiagnosed with a Wilms' tumour when she was three - a type of kidney cancer, affecting about 70 children under the age of five each year in the UK, with a 90 per cent survival rate, according to the NHS - Vicki (pictured as a child) is used to showing resilience\n\nBut the emotional rollercoaster continued when a day later, on March 20, at an appointment following a full body MRI at Watford General Hospital, Hertfordshire, doctors said they had seen 'a speck' on four of her spinal vertebrae.\n\nThey confirmed that she now had stage four breast cancer and that the spinal tumours were inoperable.\n\n'I was convinced they had the wrong scan results. I didn't feel any different,' said Vicki. 'In my head, when cancer has spread everywhere, you should be in pain, but I didn't feel any - it didn't feel real.'\n\nOn March 28 she had a lumpectomy at St Albans City Hospital to remove the tumour in her left breast, before starting an ongoing course of oral chemotherapy medication, that she takes daily every three weeks - with a week off in between - to stop the cancer from spreading any further.\n\n'I'll be on the treatment indefinitely, until doctors pick up on any further change in the cancer,' she explained.\n\nAn eternal optimist, rather than crumbling under the strain of her diagnosis, Vicki (pictured as a youngster) started making plans and at the top of her list was owning her own horse as she's been a keen rider ever since she was eight\n\n'Compared to the previous treatment it's a lot less intense and this time around I didn't lose my hair, which made a huge difference to my confidence.\n\n'But the side effects are still a constant struggle, especially during the third week of taking the medication.'\n\nAn eternal optimist, rather than crumbling under the strain of her diagnosis, Vicki started making plans.\n\nShe said: 'I didn't go off the rails after my diagnosis, instead I used it as a motivator to do everything that I wanted to do - as soon as possible.\n\n'I've even discussed having children with Simon. I know I can't have my own biological children, but we will look at fostering or adoption down the line, but I think we need a couple of years to see how the treatment pans out first.\n\nWasting no time, Vicki launched a GoFundMe page and, thanks to the generosity of family, friends and strangers raised over \u00a314,000, meaning that in June this year she was able to buy a Dutch Warmblood horse called Blitz (pictured together)\n\nVicki (pictured with her horse) said: 'As soon as I met Blitz it was love at first sight. I knew straight away that he was a kind and happy horse before I even rode him'\n\n'I also started making a short-term bucket list of things I knew I wanted to do within the year. At the top of it all was getting married, as well as owning my own horse, as I loved dressage, had won prizes and had been riding since I was eight.'\n\nWasting no time, she launched a GoFundMe page and, thanks to the generosity of family, friends and strangers raised over \u00a314,000, meaning that in June this year she was able to buy a Dutch Warmblood horse called Blitz.\n\nShe said: 'As soon as I met Blitz it was love at first sight. I knew straight away that he was a kind and happy horse before I even rode him.\n\n'But when I did get on him for the first time it was incredible, he was so considerate, the perfect horse to ride and I think he knew from that moment on I was his human mother.\n\n'When I'm riding him I can forget about everything and leave my troubles behind.'\n\nThen at Simon's insistence, the couple's initial plans to tie the knot in 2020 were brought forward by a year. Pictured: Vicki during treatment for her first diagnosis of breast cancer\n\nVicki (pictured with her horse) secured the only day available at short notice - Friday September 13 at the Leez Priory\n\nThen, at Simon's insistence, their initial plans to tie the knot in 2020 were brought forward by a year.\n\nVicki said: 'After I was told it was stage four cancer, I did wonder if we should even go ahead with the wedding at all.\n\n'It didn't seem fair on Simon, not knowing how long we would have left together. But he wasn't having any of it. He made it clear he'd stuck with me through the 2016 diagnosis and wasn't planning on running away now.\n\n'That's when he suggested pulling the wedding forward. In that moment I knew he was right. How could I say no to someone who loved me that much?'\n\nVicki's dream venue - the magnificent Leeds Castle, near Maidstone, Kent - was unavailable under such short notice.\n\nRecalling the day she chose her wedding dress, Vicki (pictured with Simon), said she was 'giddy with excitement'\n\nVicki (pictured with her husband) is now determined to enjoy married life for a while before the next bucket list celebration\n\nBut when a family friend suggested tying the knot at Leez Priory, she was lost for words.\n\n'Obviously I loved it. It was a monastery until Henry VIII had it dissolved, back when Anne Boleyn was on the scene,' she said.\n\n'I called them up, prepared to hear they were fully booked, when they told me they had a slot, but it was on a Friday - Friday 13.\n\n'Suddenly it made sense why it was free with just a few months' notice, but it didn't throw me off. I haven't had much good luck in this life and I just thought to myself, \"What's one day going to do?\"'\n\nRecalling the day she chose her wedding dress, Vicki, whose father, Dave, 55, is a builder, and brother Ali, 21, is a car salesman, said she was 'giddy with excitement'.\n\nShe continued: 'After being diagnosed with stage four cancer, I thought this might never be a possibility, so trying on dresses with my mother was such a special moment to share.'\n\nVicki (seen above) and Simon have delayed taking a honeymoon until next April, when they will jet to a luxury all-inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic for two weeks\n\nAnd in her stunning strapless gown, as she exchanged rings with her handsome husband in front of 75 guests, flanked by five bridesmaids - her younger cousin and four very close friends - dressed in sky blue chiffon frocks, she looked incredible.\n\nVicki, who took a month off from her cancer drugs so she would feel tip-top on her wedding day, said: 'It was the most beautiful setting I could have hoped for. I could see the tower against the clear blue sky as I got ready in the morning - it was perfect.\n\n'Waiting to walk down the aisle I was so, so nervous. But Simon, dressed in his morning suit \u2013 tails and everything - turned round to have a quick look before the music started and I instantly felt better. I couldn't look at him long for fear of getting a fit of giggles and losing control.\n\n'But I think everybody in the priory took a collective breath when it came to the vows. Everyone in that room knew my story and what had happened, so not only for me, but for my loved ones to see this moment... it was particularly special.'\n\nThe new Mrs Eastaugh had the first dance later to Pete Doherty's For Lovers, saying: 'Lyrically, the song spoke to both of us. There's one particular line - \"I'm running away with you just for today\" - which really rang true.\n\n'If we didn't have anything else, we had that one day and that one dance. We couldn't have summed it up more perfectly.'\n\nNow determined to enjoy married life for a while before the next bucket list celebration, Vicki and Simon have delayed taking a honeymoon until next April, when they will jet to a luxury all-inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic for two weeks.\n\n'I've always wanted to visit the Caribbean, but I just wanted to enjoy a bit of married life first,' she explained. 'I don't know how long I have left and I don't want to know.\n\n'I just wanted to carry on, to be a normal person and not the bride with cancer.'", "description": "Vicki\u00a0Eastaugh, from Hertfordshire,\u00a0vowed to love her husband\u00a0Simon, 25, 'till death us do part', and said they refused to let negativity and fears about the future surface on their big day.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/09/20073706-0-image-a-68_1571819238839.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
