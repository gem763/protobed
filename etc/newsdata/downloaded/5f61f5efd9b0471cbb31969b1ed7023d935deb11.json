Among those caught up in disaster were Scott Drinkwell (Ross Adams) and Mitchell Devereaux (Imran Adams), and tonight, viewers saw the pair freed from the wreckage. However, things weren\u2019t looking too good for Scott as the episode came to an end \u2014 but will he die as a result of the injuries he sustained?\n\nLast night, Scott and Mitchell secretly entered the florists \u2014 unaware of the devastation that was occurring elsewhere in the village. However, they soon learned of what was transpiring when they saw emergency services pass by. In an attempt to get to safety, Scott and Mitchell headed for the door \u2014 but they were horrified to find that it was jammed shut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot long afterwards, disaster struck, as the crane collapsed, and both Scott and Mitchell found themselves buried under rubble in the florist. Fans were left wondering what fate was in store for the two characters, and tonight, the pair remained unconscious under the collapsed ceiling.\n\nEventually, Cleo (Nadine Mulkerrin) spotted Scott and tried to get help \u2014 but she was horrified to realise that Mitchell was also trapped in there as well. Eventually, they were pulled free and taken to the hospital.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s clear that Scott is not out of the woods just yet, as he remained in a critical condition by the episode\u2019s end.\n\nWill he die as a result of the injuries he sustained in the devastation? It\u2019s certainly a possibility, as he was left in a pretty bad way, and sustained quite a lot of injuries as a result.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, will Cleo discover the truth about why Mitchell was in the florists alone with Scott in the first place?\n\nTomorrow\u2019s instalment of Hollyoaks is a three-hander featuring Cleo, Mitchell and Scott \u2014 so there\u2019s a large possibility that the whole truth will come to light.\n\nWith actress Nadine on maternity leave, Cleo is set to depart the village \u2014 so should Scott and Mitchell\u2019s dalliance be revealed, this could be the very reason why she takes some time away from her home.\n\nHollyoaks continues Thursday 31stOctober at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Scott was left in a pretty bad way after the ceiling collapsed on him and Mitchell in the florists.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5288-HOLLYOAKS-STUNT-06-367f_1572449619.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
