'She's the favorite of the Russians.'\n\n'They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far,' Clinton added.\n\nClinton, 71, did not mention Gabbard, 38, by name during the podcast, but her spokesman confirmed that she was referencing the Hawaii representative.\n\n'If the nesting doll fits,' Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told reporters when asked if the former secretary of state was talking about Gabbard in her interview.\n\nIf Gabbard made a third-party bid in 2020, she could draw votes away from Democrats, helping pave the way for another Donald Trump win \u2013 but Gabbard has claimed she has no interest in a third-party candidacy.\n\n'I will not' make a third-party bid, she told CNN in August. 'No, I have ruled that out.'\n\nGabbard, who has been accused of being a 'Russian asset' in recent weeks, fired back at Clinton both on Twitter and in an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Friday.\n\n'The reason why she's doing this is because ultimately she knows she can't control me,' Gabbard, who was on the campaign trail in Iowa, Carlson.\n\n'I stand against everything that she represents and she know that...if I'm the Democratic nominee and elected president, she won't be able to control me, she won't be able to manipulate me,' she said.\n\nThe active Army National Guard officer defended on the debate stage Tuesday against reports that she's a 'Russian asset' and that she's an 'apologist' of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n'I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,' Clinton said of Gabbard in a podcast interview\n\nGabbard traveled to Syria in January 2017 and met its dictator Bashar al-Assad. No photographs of their meeting have been made public.\n\nGabbard was one of the 12 candidates who qualified for the October debates in Westerville, Ohio and she holds about 1.2 per cent support from likely Democratic voters out of the 20 running for the party's nomination.\n\nShye went on the offense against the media while onstage this past week.\n\n'Just two days ago the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,' she said during the fourth debate in an outskirt of Columbus, Ohio Tuesday.\n\n'This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia.'\n\n'Completely despicable,' she said of the comments and then promised: 'As president I will end these regime change wars.'\n\nDuring the debates she also made her opposition to foreign engagement of U.S. forces clear.\n\nGabbard was deployed to Iraq in 2014 for a 12-month tour, and as part of her ongoing duties as an Army National Guardswoman took a few weeks off from the campaign trail when she reported for active duty in a two-week joint training exercise in Indonesia.\n\nButtigieg, a fellow veteran, took on Gabbard during Tuesday's debate for her military stance.\n\n'Well, respectfully, congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,' he said.\n\nButtigieg, who like Gabbard has been deployed overseas as part of the military, said it was wrong to 'abandon the international stage' or 'think our only choices are between endless war and total isolation.'\n\nHe said many U.S. troops are 'ashamed of what their country has done' by abandoning Kurdish allies who served as a ground force to take on ISIS in Syria and Iraq.", "description": "Pete Buttigieg said Sunday he doesn't feel Hillary Clinton should be accusing his 2020 rival, Tulsi Gabbard, of being supported and 'groomed' by Russia to make a third-party run.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/16/19958074-0-image-a-2_1571585307362.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
