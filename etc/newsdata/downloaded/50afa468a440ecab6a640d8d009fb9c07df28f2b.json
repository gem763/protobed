There is serious, organised violence ... but I reiterate that we are not being overwhelmed,\" he said after visiting injured police in hospital.\n\nBarcelona is Spain's second largest city and draws millions of tourists each year. Some visitors said they had been shocked by what they saw on Friday.\n\n\"We got here and were like 'Oh God'. The street was on fire in front of the hostel,\" said Flynn Winstanley, 18, a winery worker from Margaret River in Australia.
