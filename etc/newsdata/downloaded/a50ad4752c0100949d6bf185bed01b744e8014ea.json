Let's check out the charts of COUP to see if there might be more downside.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of COUP, below, we can see that prices have been swinging in wider and wider high/low trading ranges since late July. Prices rally to make a new high and then quickly sink to make a new low for the move down. The pattern gets repeated with yet another new high and yet another new low. Traders are whipped around from long to short to long to short.\n\nThis is a broadening pattern with relatively high volume. The pattern can be a continuation pattern with the prior uptrend eventually continues or it can be a painful reversal pattern that marks a high or top. Prices have swung back and forth around the 50-day moving average line while the 200-day line is still rising and below the market.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) shows a rising pattern for most of the broadening pattern, which suggests accumulation and an eventual upside breakout. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence is below the zero line but we know it will follow prices whether they break to the upside or continue lower.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of COUP, below, we can see what I consider a bullish pattern. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is bullish and the MACD oscillator is in a take profits mode for now but that could change soon.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of COUP, below, we can see that broadening pattern. The software has decided there is more selling than buying and there is a downside price target. The pattern could go either up or down and I am not sure whether we have an upside move or a downside decline.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Broadening patterns are interesting and somewhat difficult to handicap. The point and figure chart is giving us a downside price target but I do not feel confident it will happen.", "description": "Be Very Careful With Coupa Software...COUP", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Be Very Careful With Coupa Software", "Broadening Patterns Are Interesting", "Somewhat Difficult To Handicap.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Ed Ponsi", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "James", "Rev Shark", "Paul Price"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/640ff1aa-6995-11e8-8806-c71abb0ab56d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
