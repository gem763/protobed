Federal Liberals pounced on that report Saturday in a news release from Ontario Liberal MP and campaign co-chair Navdeep Bains.\n\n\"Our future prosperity depends on quality education and care for all of our children,\" said Bains, emphasizing that Scheer \"said Doug Ford was the best choice for premier of Ontario.\"\n\nAccording to a 2018 Canadian University Survey Consortium report, 50 per cent of post-secondary students graduated with debt. The average debt was pegged at $27,929.\n\nThe Conservatives have promised to increase matching grants for registered education savings plans.\n\nThey've also promised tax cuts for the lowest income bracket and tax credits for maternity benefits. Neither of those is specifically about post-secondary education but each would affect many of the same people as the expected Liberal promise.\n\nThe New Democrats have promised to eliminate interest on federal student loans, increase grants for post-secondary studies, and work with the provinces to eliminate tuition on higher education eventually.\n\nThe Greens have pledged to eliminate post-secondary tuition outright and to forgive all student-loan debt held by the federal government.\n\nThe Liberals' promised break on student loan payments is meant to reinforce previously announced measures aimed at making life more affordable for young families.\n\nTrudeau has promised to boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one and he's one-upped the Conservatives by pledging to make maternity and parental benefits tax-free when they're paid and to raise the basic personal income tax deduction to $15,000 from $12,069 for people making less than $147,000.", "description": "Measures to make post-secondary education more affordable will take centre stage Sunday when Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau unveils his party's platform, The Canadian Press has learned.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301775.1569717912!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-liberals-20190917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
