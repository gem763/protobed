The Chapter 11 filing allows the Los Angeles-based company to keep operating while it works out a plan to pay its creditors and turn around the business.\n\nForever 21 has obtained $275 million in financing from lenders with JPMorgan Chase & Co. as agent, as well as $75 million in new capital from TPG Sixth Street Partners and its affiliated funds. It plans to exit most of its international locations in Asia and Europe, but will continue operations in Mexico and Latin America. The stores expect to honor gift cards, returns and exchanges.\n\nOnce popular among teenagers in the 2000s for its affordable but eye-catching designs, Forever 21\u2019s signature bright-yellow shopping bags have become a rarer sight as Generation Z consumers -- those born from 1998 onwards -- shifted rapidly over to e-commerce and streetwear brands in recent years. The bankruptcy filing could help Forever 21 get rid of unprofitable stores and raise fresh funds, allowing the private, family-held company to restructure its flailing business for a new generation.\n\n\u201cThe financing provided by JPMorgan and TPG Sixth Street Partners will arm Forever 21 with the capital necessary to effect critical changes in the U.S. and abroad to revitalize our brand and fuel our growth, allowing us to meet our ongoing obligations to customers, vendors and employees,\u201d Linda Chang, executive vice president of Forever 21, said in a statement.\n\nBloomberg first reported Aug. 28 that Forever 21 was preparing for a bankruptcy filing.\n\nForever 21\u2019s bankruptcy filing could be problematic for major U.S. mall owners, including Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP, because it is one of the biggest mall tenants still standing after a wave of bankruptcies. The busts emptied more than 12,000 stores in the past two years, and those vacancies may be hard to fill.\n\nSimon counts Forever 21 as its sixth-largest tenant excluding department stores, with 99 outlets covering 1.5 million square feet as of March 31, according to a filing.\n\nSimon and Brookfield were both listed in court papers on Forever 21\u2019s tally of biggest unsecured creditors. The retailer doesn\u2019t have a lot of leverage over its landlords, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which said in a Sept. 27 report that Forever 21 accounts for just 1.4% of Simon\u2019s annual rent.\n\nFounded in 1984, Forever 21 operates more than 800 stores in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America. It specializes in fast-fashion apparel-- trendy, cheap, quickly-made knockoffs of original designs that often is worn only a few times before being given away or tossed out. Competitors include Zara, H&M and Amazon.com.\n\nCo-founder Do Won Chang has been focused on maintaining a controlling stake in Forever 21, which hindered efforts to raise new funds. Matters are likely to be out of his hands now, with creditors typically setting the agenda in bankruptcy proceedings and major decisions subject to a judge\u2019s approval.\n\nKirkland & Ellis LLP is the company\u2019s legal adviser, and Alvarez & Marsal is the restructuring adviser, and the investment banker is Lazard.\n\nThe case is Forever 21 Inc., 19-12122, District of Delaware (Delaware)\n\n(Updates with details from court papers)\n\n--With assistance from Rick Green, Boris Korby, David Scheer and Rachel Chang.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.net;Lauren Coleman-Lochner in New York at llochner@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Dawn McCarty\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Forever 21 Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, the latest big fashion merchant who couldn\u2019t cope with high rents and heavy competition as the shift to e-commerce cut a swathe through traditional retailers.
