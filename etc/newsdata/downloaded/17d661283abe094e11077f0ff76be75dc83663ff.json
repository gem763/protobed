Lawmakers asked about whether Facebook encouraged discrimination, for instance, as well as pointing out flaws in its content moderation techniques.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He agreed that the company was \"doing its best\" to try and take such videos down, but suggested it would never be possible to catch them all.\n\nMr Zuckerberg's hearing was advertised as focusing on Libra, the cryptocurrency that regulators fear could undermine government's power and traditional money. In recent months, the plan has come under scrutiny from lawmakers and has lost many of its biggest supporters.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But many experts don't believe it's doomed.\n\nZuckerberg, in written testimony prepared for the hearing, aimed to reassure lawmakers that his company won't try to evade financial regulators as it readies Libra.\n\nFacebook \"will not be a part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world unless all U.S. regulators approve it,\" he said. That's a stronger statement than Facebook official David Marcus made to Congress in July, when he said the company will not activate Libra until it has \"fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.\" Marcus leads the Libra project.\n\nZuckerberg is striving to defend Libra and alleviate concerns that the currency could sidestep regulators. Analysts say Libra could avoid regulation and launch in countries where it's not getting pushback, but this doesn't appear to be Facebook's intention.\n\nInstead, Zuckerberg is pushing an optimistic vision of Libra and what it could mean for people around the world who don't have access to bank accounts.\n\nThere is concern among regulators that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency could supplant the Fed and destabilize the global financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.\n\nZuckerberg also played the China card in his remarks, urging regulators to act quickly \"While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn't waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months,\" he said.\n\nThe Facebook CEO also has cited competition from China as a compelling reason against breaking up the company.\n\nThe Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting investigations of Facebook and the other huge tech companies amid accusations of abuse of their market power to crush competition.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, has advocated breaking up Facebook and other tech behemoths. She recently ran a fake political ad on Facebook taking aim at Zuckerberg to protest the company's policy of not fact-checking politicians' speech or ads in the same way it enlists outside parties to fact-check news stories and other posts.\n\nIn a major speech last week at Georgetown University, Zuckerberg defended the company's refusal to take down content from its platform it considers newsworthy \"even if it goes against our standards.\"\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter are trying to oversee internet content while also avoiding infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg has been criticised by US politicians for his company's failure to remove terrorist content, its plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency and perceived bias over what views it promotes.
