Canopy received $4 billion from Constellation Brands, and Cronos $1.8 billion from Altria.\n\nIn the case of Constellation Brands, it was apparent from the beginning that its purpose was to gain control of Canopy. That was evidenced by the company being allowed to appoint to members to the board, and having influence in appointing two more. And if they didn't get control that way, they had warrants that when and if exercised, would bring its position in Canopy to over 50 percent.\n\nAs for Cronos, hitching its future to Altria has resulted in similar outcomes, with mounting pressure for something to be done to improve the performance of the company; which is another way of saying put in new leadership.\n\nThe problem is shareholders in Constellation Brands and Altria, once the deals were made, had far too optimistic expectations for the short term, and not only that, it has weighed on the performances of both companies. Management, at both companies, should have been much or adamant and clear concerning these being long-term investments that would take time to boost the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe fact that Jody Begley, senior vice president of tobacco products for Altria Group, was recently appointed to the Board of Directors of Cronos, suggests it could be a prelude for changing management.\n\nWith the sell-off in the cannabis sector, the larger companies are under pressure to change things by shareholders, and they'll do what is needed to placate them in order to not be seen as having made a bad decision that was detrimental to shareholders.\n\nThe point is that while the market celebrated the cash infusion from these large companies as confirmation of the legitimacy of the cannabis industry, the reality is it has disrupted Canopy, will likely do the same with Cronos.\n\nWhen all is said in done, both companies gave up control, and even with the capital at their disposal, have done little to justify the investment.\n\nEven today some analysts, pundits and commentators still view the cash held by Canopy and Cronos as a competitive advantage, even though it's done nothing to improve the performances of the companies in the short term, and hasn't added much to their long-term prognosis either.\n\nAurora Cannabis (ACB) Going It Alone\n\nWhen taking into consideration the huge investments Canopy and Cronos received, and it having little impact on the performances of the companies, it reinforces to me that Aurora made the right decision in going it alone. By going it alone I mean that it refuses to give up control of the company in order to get a significant investment from a large company.\n\nWhile Canopy and Cronos may have more of a cash cushion at this time, my view is just sitting on a lot of cash in order to protect themselves from cash burn isn't a good strategy. The capital should be deployed in companies and projects that give them long-term growth prospects. Not only is that not happening, both companies will probably end up changing management in order to mitigate shareholders' concerns in regard to their suitors.\n\nI understand that most investors in Canopy point to the potential acquisition of Acreage Holdings a good deployment of capital. The obvious problem there is the deal may never be consummated, as it's dependent upon the U.S. legalizing cannabis at the federal level; something I'm not convinced will ever happen. And even if it does, it's not going to happen for a long time. What type of company will Acreage Holdings be at the time of an acquisition? What will the condition of the cannabis industry be at that time? Will its competitors have taken a lot of market share from them when the deal closes?\n\nStory continues", "description": "Aurora Cannabis, Canopy Growth and Cronos Group have driven much of the attention in the cannabis sector for some time, as Canopy and Cronos were known for receiving huge cash infusions from Constellation Brands and Altria, while Aurora was noted for resisting the same, looking to carve its own destiny", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sfqyU_eo21JuogsXgYYx7g--~B/aD0yNDM7dz0xMDY2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/b7599a2beca653d748a4027cb024b990", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
