His trivial two-game suspension caused an outcry that forced the league to adopt a much-tougher policy against off-the-field violence.\n\nJoe Lockhart\n\nIt's under that new policy that Antonio Brown, the New England Patriots wide receiver, is facing explosive accusations by his former trainer of sexual assault, including rape.\n\nAs someone who was right in the middle of the process as the executive vice president for Communications at the NFL from 2016-2018, I can tell you the new policy is working. I believe this because everyone is unhappy with it. Advocates for survivors of domestic violence think it's too soft on players, while the players union and even some owners believe it is far too tough.\n\nAt the core of the new policy is a commitment to investigate and adjudicate abuse cases independently of local law enforcement.", "description": "The Ray Rice incident changed everything about how the NFL handles domestic and sexual assault, writes Joe Lockhart, in response to the explosive accusations of sexual assault against New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown.", "authors": ["Opinion Joe Lockhart"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911131652-01-antonio-brown-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
