In recent years, though, Norton\u2019s onscreen performances have become infrequent. He has been acting less and spending more time on various tech-related business ventures. But the balance, for the time being, has swung back towards film with the impending theatrical release of his long-awaited adaptation of Jonathan Lethem\u2019s detective novel \u201cMotherless Brooklyn,\u201d which Norton, a three-time Academy Award nominee, wrote, directed and stars in. \u201cI can exercise the acting impulse at the highest level with a lot of the best people when I want to,\u201d Norton says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a rich life beyond that too.\u201d\n\nWhere does acting fit into your life these days? It seems like it\u2019s not the priority it used to be. I love the work when it\u2019s good.1 When something like \u201cBirdman\u201d2 comes along, I\u2019m on MDMA creatively. But the experience of doing these things is not novel anymore. It\u2019s also just not real life. I don\u2019t want to look back on my life and see the large majority of it colored with me playing pretend instead of actually doing things. That\u2019s not to pooh-pooh the work or knock anybody else, but I don\u2019t think that actors are better for working more. If you take a Daniel Day-Lewis or Sean Penn, the fact that you see them a lot less means that when they return there\u2019s a potency to their acting. There\u2019s a point at which any actor starts to become their own pollution.\n\nWhat you were saying about how you want to feel about the things you\u2019ve accomplished in your life \u2014 how does your involvement in a data-science company fit in with that?3 Put it this way: For me, some of it is the appeal of an intellectual puzzle. I am not a data scientist or an engineer, but I think I have a sense of where there are opportunities. That was the appeal of Uber4 to me early on. I hate the New York taxi system. It\u2019s a cartel. It\u2019s run by crooks. It abuses drivers and gives horrible service. Ride-sharing comes along and outperforms that corrupt model. There\u2019s improvement to civic society through these apps.\n\nGiven your interest in civic society,5 what do you make of the way Uber has affected cities? Does any form of car-based transportation within urban environments need to grapple with the challenges of congestion and pollution and the nature of employment? Of course. But the New York City medallion system should be canceled tomorrow. It is not egalitarian. It is terrible economically for the drivers. It drives empty cars around polluting and congesting the city. This notion that Uber is not an improvement off of where we were is absurd. Does it need to get better? Absolutely. But there is no way you can tell me that the experience of riding in a New York taxi is anything other than debased compared to ride-sharing services.\n\nI get good cabbies and bad cabbies. Come on. The cabbies now are the people who can pass the test. Have you ever asked an Uber driver if they would go back to driving a cab? I guarantee you there\u2019s not one who will say yes. Not one.\n\nEdward Norton in \u201cAmerican History X\u201d (1998). Alamy\n\nIt\u2019s no spoiler to say that your version of \u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d is pretty different from the book.6 Given how much you\u2019ve changed, what was it about the book that you were willing to spend years turning it into a movie? The fantastic emotional hook has always remained the heart of it for me. You\u2019re inside the tumultuous brain of this guy, Lionel, afflicted with Tourette\u2019s syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. But you instantly have this affinity with him, because you know him inside the calm center of his brilliant mind. And there\u2019s also a great tradition of films, be it \u201cForrest Gump\u201d or \u201cRain Man\u201d or \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d or \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d which create an emotional alignment between the audience and an underdog whom you root for not despite their affliction but because of it. There\u2019s a positivity in that. Especially now when at a mass-market level so much of heroism is being defined by this high-fructose corn syrup IV line that\u2019s about sitting back and people coming in and saving us. What\u2019s more nourishing is when people can identify with the vulnerabilities of a character and get empowerment as the character rises. Also, if you go back and look at \u201cForrest Gump\u201d it\u2019s a more politically toothy film than you remember.\n\nIs it? It is. You think \u201cthe lovable idiot who floats through history,\u201d right? But the history he floats through is a cutting look at the way America tore itself apart. There\u2019s all this mordant observation about how badly people treat each other, but Forrest Gump becomes this polestar of kindness.\n\nIt\u2019s just funny because there\u2019s no way \u201cForrest Gump\u201d would be made today, let alone be a hit. Can you imagine that pitch? Or the social media reaction? Everybody\u2019s got all kinds of opinions. \u201cChinatown\u201d is also a great movie, right? And it\u2019s in the noir tradition of looking at what\u2019s going on underneath the sunny narrative of American life. But would \u201cChinatown\u201d be made today? If you make \u201cFight Club,\u201d if you make \u201cBirdman,\u201d somebody\u2019s always going to be lazy and be like, \u201cI don\u2019t have it up for this.\u201d But they\u2019ll do 3 hours of \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d So would \u201cForrest Gump\u201d be made today? Maybe with the right people. Would \u201cChinatown\u201d? No way. If you wiped every critic\u2019s mental hard drive and put \u201cChinatown\u201d in front of them, they\u2019d take that film apart. Talk about opaque and convoluted. You just drift in the hypnosis of that film because it\u2019s this beautiful rendering of Los Angeles \u2014 great characters keep appearing and unfolding, and Jack Nicholson is magnetic. But that movie is about the unknowability of anything, the impossibility of affecting anything. It\u2019s the most cynical movie ever. You\u2019re telling me anybody\u2019s making that movie today? No way.\n\nMillions of people were watching \u201cMad Men\u201d every week. That show could be considered more than a little opaque and cynical. \u201cMad Men\u201d is cotton candy compared with \u201cChinatown.\u201d I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not interesting, but it\u2019s a different beast. \u201cChinatown,\u201d you have to sit and be patient. If you\u2019re looking for pacing, if you\u2019re looking for plot, those are not the pleasures of that movie. The pleasures are the maturity, the fineness and the obliqueness.\n\nHearing the way you talk about storytelling and the film business \u2014 even just your use of \u201chigh-fructose corn syrup\u201d \u2014 makes me wonder if your starring in \u201cThe Incredible Hulk\u201d7 was bound to involve some friction with Marvel. Well, no. I loved the \u201cHulk\u201d comics. I believed they were very mythic. And what Chris Nolan had done with Batman was going down a path that I aligned with: long, dark and serious. If there was ever a thing that I thought had that in it, it was the Hulk. It\u2019s literally the Promethean myth. I laid out a two-film thing: The origin and then the idea of Hulk as the conscious dreamer, the guy who can handle the trip. And they were like, \u201cThat\u2019s what we want!\u201d As it turned out, that wasn\u2019t what they wanted. But I had a great time doing it. I got on great with Kevin Feige.8\n\nNorton with Brad Pitt in \u201cFight Club\u201d (1999). 20th Century Fox/Photofest\n\nDidn\u2019t he put out that statement about you?9 Yeah, which was cheap. It was brand defensiveness or something. Ultimately they weren\u2019t going for long, dark and serious. But it doesn\u2019t matter. We had positive discussions about going on with the films, and we looked at the amount of time that would\u2019ve taken, and I wasn\u2019t going to do that. I honestly would\u2019ve wanted more money than they\u2019d have wanted to pay me. But that\u2019s not why I would\u2019ve wanted to do another \u201cHulk\u201d movie anyway. I went and did all the other things I wanted to do, and what Kevin Feige has done is probably one of the best executions of a business plan in the history of the entertainment industry. As a Disney shareholder, you should be on your feet for what they pulled off.\n\nMarvel may have had a good business plan, but what about its films? I want to like them more than I do. I\u2019m not going to comment on that. I\u2019m saying that Kevin had an idea of a thing that you could do, and it was remarkable. Now it didn\u2019t happen to be on a tonal, thematic level what I wanted to spend my time doing. Conflating that into a fight or a judgement is grotesque. Picking fights between other people for clickbait is grotesque. I\u2019m not being hyperbolic. It\u2019s part of what\u2019s problematic in our country. We are letting ourselves be polluted by fake fights manufactured by other people for other agendas. Whether it\u2019s Russians manipulating us into intense arguments with one another over fabricated [expletive] or stupid entertainment journalism trying to get clicks. It\u2019s like, I did Bruce Willis\u2019s Comedy Central roast, and I made a joke at my expense. I talked about how I tried to do what Bruce did and make a big movie but I was an idiot because I tried to make the script better.10 This is a joke making fun of myself but they\u2019ll turn it into, like, \u201cEdward takes a dig at Marvel.\u201d No, I\u2019m taking a dig at myself at a roast. People have to grow up.\n\nThat joke is based on a perception that you can be tough to work with.11 I\u2019m curious about what that perception means for you. But you\u2019re talking about things the roots of which are from 1998 when I and my friend David McKenna developed \u201cAmerican History X.\u201d12 People take things that happen between fervent people who care about the work and who end up shaking hands with each other and they make it into drama.\n\nI watch everything and I read everything when I research. That perception exists beyond whatever happened with \u201cAmerican History X.\u201d You\u2019re not reading anything that\u2019s any more authentic than people reading a Russian trollbot\u2019s story about Hillary Clinton and a pizza parlor is authentic. You\u2019re going \u201cthere must be something to this\u201d just like some guy in the MAGA hat is being engineered by the G.R.U. into feeling antagonistic with liberals. You\u2019re wasting your time engaging with the matrix that\u2019s trying to foment negativity. The fact that there\u2019s a certain credence to it in your mind \u2014 is it possible that there\u2019s literally nothing to this?\n\nThat\u2019s what I want to understand. I\u2019m trying to get at what it actually means for someone to have this reputation. Does it mean an actor who pushes back with directors? Does it mean someone who adjusts the screenplays? Honestly, I find the whole line a little boring. You\u2019re pulling on a narrative from things when I was 28 years old. That\u2019s not even a contemporary meme around me.\n\nNorton with Gugu Mbatha-Raw in \u201cMotherless Brooklyn,\u201d which he directed and adapted from Jonathan Lethem\u2019s 1999 novel. Glen Wilson/Warner Bros.\n\nLet\u2019s move on. I rewatched \u201cAmerican History X\u201d and \u201cFight Club,\u201d and it\u2019s impossible to see them and not think about how they resonate with the culture today. Have you been surprised at the way those movies\u2019 themes have metastasized? Not in the slightest. We\u2019ve got a real problem in this country with the ripple effects of people feeling thwarted, marginalized, emasculated, neutered, left behind. The irony is that a lot of people have said to me about \u201cAmerican History X,\u201d \u201cWow, I was fascinated by the almost-Shakespearean idea in it that in a smart person, rage can be a fatal flaw.\u201d But back then you were able to relegate that rage to jackboots and skinheads and swastikas. Now it\u2019s dungarees and button-down shirts. It doesn\u2019t even need extremity around it. \u201cFight Club\u201d was coming at things from a more satirical angle, but everything that we\u2019re seeing today in terms of an irrational, almost self-defeating willingness of a certain sort of white nativist lower class to find identification in vituperative, celebratory-of-violence assertions is fallout from feeling marginalized. When people feel that they can\u2019t get out from under, you get identification with regressive ideas about whose fault that is.\n\nEarlier you mentioned how an actor can become their own pollution. Is that at all related to why you\u2019ve dialed back?13 It\u2019s a combination of things. Jim Houghton14 and I launched an $80 million fundraising campaign for the Pershing Square Signature Center up on 42nd Street two months after the financial crisis in 2008. I was completely consumed in that project. I was also building my first company around that time, CrowdRise.15 Very quickly we had 100 employees and were raising venture capital money and then selling that company. I was writing the script for \u201cMotherless Brooklyn.\u201d I had a kid. In that same period I was investing in Kensho.16 I was the one of the largest stakeholders in that company early on and concurrently built a fund that ran all the secondary trading in it. Then in 2015 Daniel and I built a parallel data science company called EDO that\u2019s working on media data.\n\nCan you explain what that means exactly? The core of what EDO is doing is this: The entire pricing structure around television advertising is pegged off data from Nielsen. It\u2019s basically a measurement of notionally how many eyeballs got on something. They can\u2019t tell you what happened as a result of that. EDO can measure in a granular and finance-grade way what a television ad did in terms of actions by people that specifically correlate with purchase activity. This all grew out of observations on my part that this system through which creative product is advertised and put out is a wildly inefficient one of spraying and praying.\n\nWhat would change about the TV and movie business if that system were more efficient? Everybody wants a more accurate metric of the effectiveness of the inventory they\u2019re selling and the ads they\u2019re placing. Having that is exciting to me because, in trying to get money pulled together for \u201cMotherless Brooklyn,\u201d I would be sitting there going: \u201cWhat am I not seeing? What\u2019s the perceived fear in this?\u201d And it all has to with the dollars that have to be spent on marketing and the uncertainty about that spending when a film doesn\u2019t fit a mold. It would be nice to not have to beat your head against the wall for five years to make something. Netflix is an excellent example of what I\u2019m talking about: They\u2019re the most data-scienced entertainment content studio in history, and as a result they\u2019ve de-risked it for themselves. They don\u2019t have to worry about the marketing per se, and that\u2019s why they stole 100 billion of market cap from the traditional entertainment complex.\n\nMaybe this question is premised on a category error, but I\u2019ll ask it anyway: Is there any commonality between what you think you\u2019ve learned about human behavior from being an actor and what you\u2019ve learned about it from data analytics? Does one of these ways of understanding people sit within my brain while I\u2019m doing the other? No. Does working on acting and working on data affirm that people are fascinating? Yes. There are things that people do that signal their intent more credibly than what they say about themselves. And maybe I\u2019m reaching to answer the question in an interesting way, but within that observation is something that\u2019s not far off from what really great acting is sometimes. Which is the mining of the paradoxes that exist within people.\n\nWhat example comes to mind? People talk about Meryl Streep as one of the greatest actors in film history, which she is. She reveals the fa\u00e7ade and what\u2019s going on underneath at the same time. There are echoes of that in this bizarrely granular world we live in of incredible amounts of data about people\u2019s private actions. What people believe they\u2019re doing in private is very different from the ways they express themselves when they know \u2014 or suspect \u2014 that they\u2019re being seen.", "description": "The actor on why he has (mostly) ditched Hollywood for the tech world.", "authors": ["David Marchese"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/magazine/13mag-talk/13mag-talk-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
