Since moving to Real Madrid in 2009, Ronaldo has scored at a rate of a goal per game. Messi\u2019s numbers in the same period are similar.\n\nIt is why Gareth Bale, with a scoring ratio of less than one in two, has not elevated himself to the same plain.\n\nSterling runs off to celebrate his third goal as City won in the Champions League on Tuesday\n\nBut Sterling can. As good a player as he is, he will not win a Ballon d\u2019Or in the manner of Zinedine Zidane or Luka Modric, a reward for skill, class and creativity.\n\nRather, Sterling knows that the currency needed to buy a seat at the top table is goals - that is what Messi and Ronaldo trade in.\n\nSterling\u2019s goals - look at his three this week - are largely scored from the same domain, arriving at the far post from the left-hand channel. He has found a way to score and there is nothing opposition teams can do about it.\n\nHis finishing is unerringly accurate and unflinchingly composed. Indeed, he makes it look simple. And, if you\u2019re going to score 50 goals per season, that is how it has to be - you can\u2019t arrive at a half century by complicating matters every time you\u2019re in front of the posts.\n\nThe forward has become one of the most impressive forwards in world football in recent years\n\nConsider his age, too - still just 24 and with his best years ahead of him. It is this scope for improvement that can see him join the world\u2019s best in the next 18 months.\n\nHe is in the running for the Ballon d\u2019Or of 2019 but, come this time next year, Sterling should be looking to make himself favourite, not just a contender.\n\nTo do that he will need games, goals and glory - and given he represents Manchester City and an exciting England, there is every chance 2020 could bring multiple trophies.\n\nOff the pitch he has emerged as a role model, not just for young players but his peers, too. He is leading by example in what he says and what he does.\n\nUltimately, though, his performances on the pitch will determine if can ever be considered the world\u2019s best footballer.\n\nOf all those attempting to break the Messi and Ronaldo duopoly, it is Sterling who looks best placed to do so.\n\nTHE CASE AGAINST - PETE JENSON\n\nHis manager has already said it as clearly as possible: \u2018Nobody can compare with Cristiano and Messi\u2019. It was Pep Guardiola\u2019s response to being asked in September if Raheem Sterling was getting close.\n\nHaving watched Messi and Ronaldo since 2003 and 2008 respectively, what is hard to imagine Sterling, or any player, achieving is their relentless repetition of brilliance.\n\nRonaldo with his 700-plus goals and Messi, having just won his sixth Golden Shoe, have a machine-like consistency that never fails regardless of opponent or occasion.\n\nTheir impact on a team is greater than that of any player since Diego Maradona\u2019s influence on Napoli and Argentina.\n\nLionel Messi has a machine-like consistency that never fails regardless of the opponent\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has also now managed to score 700 goals during his playing career\n\nPeople in Madrid ask why Zinedine Zidane can\u2019t be like the \u2018old Zidane who won three Champions Leagues\u2019. Anyone spot the reason why he might not be able to make the team unstoppable in Europe as he did in 2016, 2017 and 2018?\n\nRonaldo was sold and nothing has been the same since. Messi has the same effect on Barcelona.\n\nThey started this season looking ordinary. Now they are top of La Liga and look the team to beat once more. There is no great mystery behind that beyond the fact that Messi missed the first month of the season.\n\nMessi won the sixth Golden Shoe of his career earlier this month, in a nod to his goalscoring\n\nSterling\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t compare. Which is not to say that he can\u2019t dominate the post-Messi and Ronaldo world. The leaps forward he has made since 2016 have been huge and the importance of constant improvement in great players is often overlooked. In his early days at United, Ronaldo was not the finisher he then became.\n\nMessi's critics said he couldn\u2019t head it, couldn\u2019t go a season without getting injured, and had no leadership qualities. He buried all those criticisms because even with genius as his starting point he was still able to improve.\n\nGuardiola said of Sterling after last night\u2019s hat-trick: \u2018He has that desire to get better.\u2019\n\nIn among all their other attributes that quality continues to be one of Messi and Ronaldo\u2019s most important. It will see them dominate until they retire.", "description": "CRAIG HOPE AND PETE JENSON: Raheem Sterling bagged another hat-trick on Tuesday as he continued his brilliant season.
