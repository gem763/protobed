Others have introduced strict conditions on entry to their concerts - such as printing photo ID directly onto tickets, requiring the credit card-holder who made the booking to be present at the venue.\n\n\"I feel like a lot of solutions out there are making it harder for the fans,\" says Hutcheon.\n\n\"Our belief is that the only customer we have is the fans, so we ignore everything else and make sure we deliver for them.\"\n\nLaunched in the UK in 2014, Dice acts as both a marketplace and a music discovery platform. \"For me, that's the goal,\" says Hutcheon. \"How do I get you to go out twice as often as you do now?\"\n\nBefore teaming up with Primavera, the company has also handled tickets for such high-profile artists as Adele, Solange, A$AP Rocky and Kanye West - who used the app to organise listening parties for his 2018 album, Ye.\n\nHutcheon says their experience running events in the UK, France, US, Italy and Australia should make the Primavera experience \"seamless\" for fans.\n\n\"It may sound na\u00efve but, because we've been doing this for a while, we're constantly surprised how, if you make something really easy, people quickly pick up on it.\n\n\"We're so used to using our phones for mobile ticketing and getting into things, it's actually not that complicated.\"\n\nThe company's multi-year deal with Primavera will also see it providing mobile tickets for the Portuguese leg of Primavera as well as club nights and tours in Spain.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cult US band Pavement are reforming to play Primavera next summer\n\nThe line-up for Primavera 2020 has yet to be announced, although cult indie band Pavement have announced they will reform for two anniversary shows at the festival's Spanish and Portuguese incarnations - their only concerts next year.\n\nTickets went on sale on Tuesday night and, so far, the process has run smoothly.\n\nAnd while the festival isn't the first music event to experiment with paperless ticketing, founder Pablo Soler said he hoped others would follow suit.\n\n\"I don't think we are setting an example as currently there are plenty of smaller events worldwide already using this system with total success,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"But I do think that digital dynamic tickets will be the standard in the festival and events market very soon.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
