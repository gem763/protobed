(But I had to go to court to do it)", "language": "en", "text": "We all find spam emails irritating, but most of us just delete them and move on. ]\n\nHowever, after receiving three unsolicited emails within days, Michael Green decided to complain to the offending company.\n\nIt would be the start of a 14-month legal battle that proves you can fight back against spam mail \u2014 and win.\n\nVictory: Michael was pestered with unsolicited emails but decided to take the offending company to court\n\nLondoner Michael used online jobs firm CV Library to apply for a web developer job in May last year.\n\nAfter getting an email advertising a host of other jobs, he tried unsubscribing, but couldn't find an option on the message.\n\nAfter two more unwanted job alert emails arrived in his inbox Michael, 27, wrote to the firm to complain about its privacy policy and asked for his details to be removed from its system.\n\nIn a letter seen by Money Mail, CV Library explained that when users register with the website as a jobseeker, it collects personal information, such as their name, contact details, the type of work they are looking for and CV.\n\nIt said it then uses this personal data to send job alerts and emails about courses relevant to their interests. The firm insisted it had acted lawfully and followed the correct procedure.\n\nBut Michael disagreed \u2014 and unfortunately for CV Library, the computer programmer is also an expert in consumer lawsuits having run a company dealing with class action court cases.\n\nIn June last year, Michael wrote a 'pre-action letter' warning the firm it had breached regulations by sending the emails and that he would be seeking damages.\n\nHe launched court proceedings the following month by filling in an N1 form, which allows you to make a claim against a person or organisation to settle a dispute, and sending it to the County Court Money Claims Centre.\n\nThis June, Michael attended a county court hearing, where he argued that CV Library had not made it clear how his details would be used after he applied for a job.\n\nAccording to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, firms must not send marketing messages to people without consent\n\nHe said he had not been expecting any further communication from the firm and did not sign up to receive emails.\n\nFinally, in August, the judge ruled in his favour and ordered CV Library to pay \u00a3150 in damages, \u00a3285 court fees and \u00a395 to cover his lost day's wages \u2014 a total of \u00a3530.\n\nMichael says: 'Firms cannot hide their terms and conditions and must be upfront about how your information will be used. People must give their explicit consent. It's not OK to hide it.'\n\nAccording to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, firms must not send marketing messages to people without consent.\n\nMatthew Cole, head of data protection law at Prettys Solicitors, says everyone has rights to choose how their information is processed.\n\nTo stop marketing emails, look for an unsubscribe option. If there isn't one, contact the company and ask to be removed from the list.\n\nMr Cole says: 'Customer information is valuable and lots of firms are reliant on holding on to their databases.\n\nCV Library may argue it has a legitimate reason to send customers emails, but the court takes a hard view of this.' You can write asking a company to stop processing your data under the Data Protection Act.\n\nThe firm must act on this request within 30 days. Mr Cole says you could also make a Subject Access Request to find out what personal information the firm is storing.\n\nIf they do not respond, you can complain to the information watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office.CV Library has refused to comment, but says its terms and conditions are on its website.\n\nHow you can do it...\n\nComplain to the company concerned. It is much better to try to reach a resolution.\n\nIf you'RE getting nowhere, complain to the ombudsman. This could be the Financial Ombudsman, Energy Ombudsman or Legal Ombudsman.\n\nProvide evidence such as emails, phone logs and letters.\n\nYou can complain to data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office \u2014 but it cannot award damages.\n\nIf you'RE confident of your case, you can go to court. Print off an N1 form (gov.uk/government/publications/form-n1-claim-form-cpr-part-7), which allows you to make a claim to settle a dispute. State what you are claiming for and why. If it is under \u00a310,000 you can also use the Government's online service moneyclaims.service.gov.uk.\n\nIT CAN take up to a year and cost a few hundred pounds in fees. You can recover the court fees if you win, but not costs if you use an adviser.\n\nIt can be stressful so you may want to speak to Citizens Advice beforehand.\n\na.murray@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Londoner Michael Green used online jobs firm CV Library to apply for a web developer job in May last year.
