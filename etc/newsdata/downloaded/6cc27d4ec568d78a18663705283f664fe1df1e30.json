He said there will potentially be a little more responsibility for the other guys to step up and want the ball,\" George said.\n\n\"You work towards the ball all the time anyway. Whenever he sees me and Billy as an option, the scrum-half just passes it to Billy anyway which is probably fair enough!\n\n\"If he does or doesn't play then we're all aware that we need to get our hands on the ball and impose ourselves physically.\"\n\nFrance coach Jacques Brunel\n\n\"What matters tonight is the qualification,\" he said.\n\n\"That was our first goal: it was not easy. There were stages to pass. We passed them: sometimes with difficulty - but we passed them.\n\n\"The first thing to secure, is the qualification, which fully satisfied us.\"", "description": "What is it?", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Daniel Schofield", "Mick Cleary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/07/england-france-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpJliwavx4coWFCaEkEsb3obhCNL6eGYb8WWtNBD0x3E.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
