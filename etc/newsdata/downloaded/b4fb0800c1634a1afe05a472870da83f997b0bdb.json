They became concerned and called the police and ambulance.\n\n\u2018They turned up and checked on me. They came up to my room to make sure I was fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t speaking to this person for a reason and they were worried about my safety because I wasn\u2019t answering the phone.\u2019\n\nHe claimed his parents were already at the house with him, and the three of them were busy hanging pictures on the walls.\n\nGemma thanked her friend for bringing a bouquet of lilies to her house (Picture: Instagram)\n\n\u2018I was perfectly fine, we all had a chat and carried on the day with my parents, we were just hanging up pictures,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018The police and paramedics were only here for about 10 minutes.
