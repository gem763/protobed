Take the hanger and use the clips to secure the curtains together; voila, instant blackout curtains!\n\nTwitter user Rick Klau posted an image to show off the finished result, and revealed he himself learned the trick from a fellow social media user.\n\nHe wrote: \"I don't remember who posted this on Twitter a few years ago, but whoever you are: you have improved every night I've spent in a hotel since.\"\n\nOf course not all hotel rooms have hangers with clips, but you don't necessarily need the hanger - you just need a clip.\n\nIn fact, Twitter users shared some of their own variations on the hack in response to Rick's post.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBack-up plans included packing a couple of hair claws in your luggage, as these can achieve the same effect, and double up for other easy tricks such as holding shirt collars in place, or managing cords.\n\nOther alternatives included binder clips which can easily be stored in luggage and take up very little space. In fact, one social media user said they just keep some constantly in their bags - an easy way of ensuring you don't forget to pack some.\n\nPeople didn't just share their advice for hotel room curtains.\n\nThere were also some nifty tips such as using the hotel room dry cleaning bag as a 'dirty laundry' bag to keep your used items separate to clean ones, or hanging wrinkled clothes in the bathroom so that when you shower you can steam out the creases.", "description": "One man has a simple yet effective way of blocking out that sliver of light - and everything you need is in the hotel room", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531299.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Older-Caucasian-man-opening-hotel-curtains.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
