This is when there are fertile opportunities to both increase income and decrease taxes in the (hopefully many) years that will follow.\n\nBut at 70, the window closes.\n\nThe key to this period is understanding three things: First, the opportunities accompanying delayed Social Security benefits. Second, the time before required minimum distributions (RMDs) from IRAs and 401(k)s begin the year you reach age 70 \u00bd. And third, affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits (subsidies) for health insurance until 65. The first two will eventually put taxable income on your tax return, but you control if and how much this happens in your 60s. The third puts money in your pocket.\n\nHere are some specific strategies:\n\n1. Strategic income generation: As long as your health and life expectancy aren\u2019t below average, the benefits of delaying the start of your Social Security benefits are well-documented. This is especially true for the higher-earning spouse in a married couple since a surviving spouse continues receiving this higher amount. Take full advantage of this. As much as 85% of Social Security is taxable once it starts, based on the amounts of your other taxable income. Until it starts, however, that \u201croom\u201d on your tax return is a planning opportunity. The goal is to tax some of these other sources now before they also make more of your Social Security taxable. However, you\u2019ll need income from elsewhere until then.\n\nThe best way to do this is to use aftertax savings and investments for income since (most) of this won\u2019t appear on your tax return. If the only way to fund living expenses is with IRA or 401(k) withdrawals, that\u2019s still beneficial.\n\nThe top federal rate on ordinary income like interest, pensions, wages, rental income, annuity payments, Social Security, IRA and 401(k) withdrawals is just 12% in 2018 on the first $101,400 of such income for an under-65 married couple claiming the $24,000 standard deduction. This is true on the first $50,700 for singles and slightly higher for both when turning 65. In all but one situation below, make your ordinary income this high now--but no higher since the next bracket jumps to 22%--to avoid even higher taxation after age 70 when such sources will be taxable and likely cause more of your Social Security to unnecessarily be taxed as well.\n\n2. Roth conversion: The most powerful planning opportunity comes in years when you can generate the income you need without going over the thresholds stated above. Then you can fill up the rest of these low tax brackets by converting IRA assets to a Roth IRA. You pay tax on the converted amount now, at 12%, but this money--and its future growth--never appears on any future tax return. Nor does it ever cause more of any other other income source to be taxable. And there are no RMD requirements for as long as you (and any surviving spouse beneficiary) are alive. Taxpayers with more $1 million in pretax retirement assets should consider converting enough to also fill the next federal bracket as well.\n\n3. Lower RMDs. Any money in Roth IRAs should be invested in equities, which higher expected returns than bonds or certificates of deposit. And your pretax retirement accounts should lower their equity holdings by the same amount. This will keep your total equity amount the same but gradually shift them to your Roth IRA where they grow tax-free. Your total return will be the same, but less of it will occur in your pretax accounts which will lower future RMD amounts. Over time, this \u201casset location\u201d strategy can make a surprising difference.\n\nDoing the items above for several years will make the amount of your pretax retirement plan assets lower by the time you reach age 70 than if you had claimed Social Security earlier and/or hadn\u2019t done any Roth conversions. Of course, that means lower future taxable RMD amounts. It likely also means less of your Social Security income is taxable, too. In many cases, $1,000 of lower future RMDs also keeps $850 of Social Security from being taxable; even at the 12% rate, each $1,850 would otherwise create $222 more taxes ($1,850 x 0.12) annually. This is even more valuable to surviving spouses who often find themselves in the next tax bracket \u2013 a big jump to 22% - as single taxpayers, the cruelest of all tax increases.\n\n4. Health-care subsidies: There is one case for delaying these steps until (at least one of) you turn 65 and start Medicare. Unless your former employer is still paying your health premiums after you retire, thousands of dollars of tax-free ACA premium subsidies are available if you can keep your \u201cincome\u201d low enough--and lower than the thresholds mentioned above. I wrote about this in more detail in a previous post. This strategy usually requires funding some living expenses from aftertax assets that don\u2019t \u201ccount.\u201d If you can--even for just a year or two--it\u2019s often worth it to collect them and waiting until Medicare to fully implement the other strategies.\n\nRead the latest Encore Report.", "description": "Retirees have a window to both increase income and decrease taxes for future years, says WSJ Retirement and Wealth Expert Jonathan Guyton.", "authors": ["Jonathan Guyton"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CL600_retire_P_20181123110210.jpg"}
