Both Moody\u2019s and S&P recently affirmed J&J\u2019s top-notch AAA rating, after a landmark ruling in Oklahoma slapped the giant with a $572 million judgement.\n\nHowever, there are question marks hanging over other pharmaceutical companies in the center of the opioid storm. Analysts say the potential weight of a big legal judgement could force smaller players to either fold completely, or be bought out.\n\n\u201cEvery company has a different incentive to settle,\u201d S&P analyst David Kaplan told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \u201cWhen we take the pattern together, it really all collectively points to this being a greater risk than we had thought.\u201d\n\nThere have already been a number of smaller settlements, ranging from the tens of millions to hundreds of millions. The largest settlement came from OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma\u2014which offered a little more than $10 billion.\n\nMike Hunter, Oklahoma Attorney General, listens during the Opioid trial in Norman, Okla., Monday, June 24, 2019.

According to S&P\u2019s analysis, companies like Mylan (MYL), Cardinal Health, McKesson and AmerisourceBergen are considered \u201cmedium risk bucket\u201d \u2014 but names like Teva (TEVA), Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP) face the highest risk.\n\n\u201cAll these companies have been downgraded by S&P over the past year, and opioid issues contributed to downgrades in some cases,\u201d S&P\u2019s analysts wrote.\n\nMallinckrodt has already reportedly hired a restructuring firm, the news of which resulted in a negative hit in the markets earlier this month. And Teva has indicated greater anticipated liabilities, Kaplan said on Tuesday.\n\nTeva is not required to indicate further liabilities unless it is probable, and the company indicated they were keeping reserves at $646 million. Given that the most recent settlement was $85 million, the larger provision hints at greater anticipated liability.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the bigger companies like Johnson & Johnson are concerned about their level of exposure, given their relative financial strength \u2014 and the lack thereof of the other defendants, analysts say.\n\nRecent reports suggest the remaining companies are trying to piggyback on Purdue bankruptcy settlement, but without filing bankruptcy themselves, to be free of any future opioid liabilities. One company, Endo Pharmaceuticals, confirmed to Yahoo Finance on Tuesday that the option was on the table.\n\n\u201cEndo continues to explore various global settlement mechanisms to resolve the pending opioid litigation, including, among others, a construct that could potentially be implemented through Purdue Pharma\u2019s recent bankruptcy filing,\u201d according to a statement emailed by the company.\n\n\u201cWe are engaged in preliminary discussions with key stakeholders regarding this matter but there can be no assurances that those or any other discussions will be successful. We have no further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nA year ago, Endo\u2019s stock was trading at $17.37 per share; it closed at $3.34 in Tuesday\u2019s dealings.\n\nYahoo Finance's All Markets Summit on October 10 More\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
