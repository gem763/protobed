Good for him!\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has already drawn the ire of artists like Neil Young and R.E.M. for using their music at the Republican frontrunner\u2019s campaign stops without permission, and now another rock legend is threatening legal action against the mogul: Aerosmith has filed a cease-and-desist letter to Trump demanding that the candidate stop using \u201cDream On\u201d at his rallies.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, it was singer Steven Tyler\u2018s reps specifically who sent the legal notice. \u201cTrump for President does not have our client\u2019s permission to use \u2018Dream On\u2019 or any of our client\u2019s other music in connection with the Campaign because it gives the false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid,\u201d the cease-and-desist letter read.\n\nThis was actually Trump\u2019s second warning: He was initially asked to refrain from utilizing \u201cDream On\u201d after an August 21st rally in Mobile, Alabama, yet Trump continued to play the track at rallies, including his stops in Las Vegas \u2013 where he air-drummed along with \u201cDream On\u201d \u2013 and Atlanta this weekend. This time around, Tyler\u2019s legal team gave Trump a 24-hour window warning the mogul\u2019s campaign, \u201cIf Trump for President does not comply with our demands, our client will be forced to pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies which our client may have against you.\u201d\n\nWhereas it\u2019s common for Republicans to receive blowback for using songs written by liberal-leaning artists, the GOP would likely feel more comfortable employing Aerosmith\u2019s music, especially considering that guitarist Joe Perry proclaimed that he is a \u201cdefinite old-school Republican\u201d in a 2012 interview. However, this could be a case where either the band collectively wants to stay politically neutral, or Perry or Tyler support a non-Trump Republican as the GOP presidential candidate.\n\nHowever, the fact that Tyler\u2019s reps sent the cease-and-desist is especially surprising, since Tyler was reportedly Trump\u2019s personal guest at the first GOP debate in August, The Hollywood Reporter writes. Tyler has also served as a judge on Trump\u2019s Miss USA pageant and, in September 2014, Trump tweeted that he had attended an Aerosmith concert and lauded Tyler\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cDream On\u201d is the latest classic track to be employed without authorization by the Trump campaign, joining R.E.M.\u2018s \u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\u201d and Neil Young\u2018s \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo fuck yourselves, the lot of you \u2014 you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men,\u201d R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe said of Trump\u2019s use of the Document track in a statement via bassist Mike Mills\u2019 Twitter page. \u201cDo not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Young said in June, \u201cDonald Trump was not authorized to use \u2018Rockin\u2019 in the Free World\u2019 in his presidential candidacy announcement. Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America.\u201d Soon after, the Trump campaign stopped using the Freedom song, and Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign started using it.", "description": "Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage", "authors": ["Daniel Kreps", "Daniel Kreps'S Most Recent Stories", "See Families Separated U.S. Border Reunite In Powerful", "Minute Hug", "Zac Brown Sues Ryan Tedder Over", "Nowhere Left To Go", "Song Rights", "Frank Zappa Marks Anniversary Of", "Hot Rats", "With Massive Reissue"], "top_image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-212565-GettyImages-454604916.jpg", "published_at": "2015-10-11"}
