It is also a rescue effort of sorts for Trump\u2019s first golf course in Europe, which has lost money each year since it opened in 2012. A second local council this week also approved the company\u2019s plan to build a second golf course on the site.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted. Common sense has prevailed,\u201d Sarah Malone, an executive vice president at the Trump Organization who oversees the Aberdeen project, told reporters after the vote. \u201cToday\u2019s very strong recommendation is a clear endorsement by the northeast of Scotland that the Trump development to date is already a success and we want to build on that great foundation.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of its confidence in Wednesday\u2019s vote, the Trump Organization had already begun marketing the homes as part of what it called the Trump Estate, with some homes priced at more than $1.5 million.\n\nIf the Trump Organization follows through on these plans, it would turn the company into something it hasn\u2019t been before: a large-scale residential home builder. The company has built condo buildings before, and sold off a few dozen houses or home lots next to other golf courses. But the company is now proposing to build a sizable suburban development, complete with the expenses of roads, streets and a school.\n\nThe outcome in Aberdeen runs contrary to the general trend for Trump\u2019s family business. Since he took office, leaving day-to-day control of his company to his sons, the real estate empire has seen revenue decline at several key properties, including his Mar-a-Lago Club and the Doral resort in Florida.\n\nA rare bright spot is Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel, which has attracted business from Trump\u2019s political allies, foreign politicians and lobbyists.\n\nThe company also has faced repeated controversies for mixing business with politics. Visiting diplomats and U.S. officials have come under scrutiny for patronizing the president\u2019s properties. The Pentagon acknowledged spending nearly $200,000 at Turnberry, Trump\u2019s other Scotland golf course, over the past two years to put up U.S. Air Force crews. Trump also has proposed hosting next year\u2019s G-7 conference of world leaders at his resort in Doral, Florida.\n\nOn one level, the Aberdeen dispute has been about the future of a small Scottish village and comes with all the attendant not-in-my-backyard tensions. But because neighbor in question is Donald Trump, geopolitical passions have been stirred into the local brew. Amid the swirl of impeachment and Brexit, residents of Aberdeen were handed their own chance to opine about Trump.\n\n\u201cMy fingers are numb,\u201d said councilman Brian Topping about the mountain of email that came his way.\n\nOf the 2,921 households who weighed in with planning authorities, only three supported the Trump plan.\n\nThe Trump Organization\u2019s proposal involves building 500 houses and 50 holiday cottages, plus shops, restaurants, and other community facilities on its 430-acre seaside property. The development is in the village of Balmedie, a misty little burgh of about 2,500 people that could get significantly more crowded if the development comes to fruition.\n\nResidents have blasted the plan from many directions, arguing that hundreds of new homes would clog roads, overburden schools, fail to boost the local economy, swamp sewers, harm trees and wildlife, block routes to the beach, and \u201cfurther devastate a once beautiful unspoiled area,\u201d as a planning report described one line of opposition.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s meeting, councilors struggled to separate the normal planning process from the fact that the U.S. president was involved in this case. One councilor, Martin Ford, recused himself because of his past criticism of Trump \u2014 but not before announcing that the area\u2019s \u201cstanding and reputation\u201d had been damaged by association with Trump and his \u201cincitement to violence, racism, misogyny, and environmental vandalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Ford, I think that\u2019s wholly inappropriate,\u201d the presiding provost scolded him. \u201cI would ask you not to continue with that line.\u201d\n\nThe Aberdeen course has been a contentious subject for more than a decade.\n\nEarly on, landowners fought against selling their land to Trump at the prices he offered. More recently, some hoisted Mexican flags on their property to protest the president. Trump also unsuccessfully sued the Scottish government to stop a wind farm from being built in view of his course.\n\nFor authorities, the issue this week was about what the Trump Organization wanted to build.\n\nThe Trump Organization had received approval in 2008 to build hundreds of homes as long as they also built their planned golf tourism resort that officials hoped would enhance the local economy. The plan included a 450-room hotel, a conference center, a spa and other amenities.\n\nThat hotel has not been built and the only existing lodging on Trump\u2019s property is a boutique hotel with 21 rooms. Hordes of golf tourists have so far not materialized. The golf course is closed for five months of the year during winter and is regularly blasted by inclement weather even when open.\n\nCompany executives have indicated that shifting to residential real estate is the best chance for the project\u2019s survival.\n\n\u201cFor long term sustainability \u2014 this is a real estate play \u2014 we\u2019re going to have to sell homes,\u201d George Sorial, a former Trump Organization executive who oversaw the Aberdeen project in its early years, said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nBut by shifting to building homes instead of a big hotel, some locals believe the Trump Organization has betrayed its promise to boost the economy.\n\n\u201cWe were promised something transformative with this development,\u201d said Councilor Richard Thomson, who voted against the plan. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is it.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Organization argued that the local economy had changed in the past decade \u2014 after the 2008 recession and the 2014 oil price collapse \u2014 and that a big hotel was no longer economically feasible.\n\n\u201cThere is a crisis of oversupply in the northeast of Scotland,\u201d Malone, of the Trump Organization, said. \u201cWe are world leaders when it comes to building five star hotels. You just need to look at our record. If there was a market to build a 450-bedroom hotel, we would be the first ones to do it.\u201d\n\nProponents of the plan said that any new development could still provide an economic boon to the local area.\n\n\u201cGermany is going into recession. France appears to be in recession. Southern Europe is going into recession. And we have an American businessman who is prepared to make a multimillion pound investment into Aberdeenshire,\u201d said Councilor Sebastian Lane. \u201cI think that is marvelous.\u201d\n\nDavid A.
