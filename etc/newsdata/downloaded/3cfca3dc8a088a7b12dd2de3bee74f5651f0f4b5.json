Analysts Are Still Bullish on the Stock.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nShares of Acceleron Pharma are plummeting after the biotech \ufeff company said it was discontinuing development of an experimental drug meant to treat facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, a rare genetic disease.\n\nWhile some analysts dropped their price targets for Acceleron (ticker: XLRN) on the news, many remained bullish. Still, the stock fell 6.8% in premarket trading.\n\nCowen analyst Yaron Werber said there had been skepticism of the drug, called ACE-083, even before this week\u2019s news. \u201cWe think the termination of further development is a clearing event as investors have been worrying that further development will be costly and unlikely to yield approval,\u201d Werber wrote in a research note on Monday evening,.\n\nThe back story. Shares of Acceleron are up 2.5% so far this year, trailing behind the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF (IBB), which is up 9%, and the S&P 500, up 19.6%. The company, which currently has no approved drugs, has a deal with Celgene (CELG) to develop luspatercept, Acceleron\u2019s lead drug candidate, which would tread serious blood disorders.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. On Monday, Acceleron said in a statement that ACE-083 failed to achieve \u201cstatistically significant improvements in functional endpoints relative to placebo\u201d in a Phase 2 trial of the drug in patients with facioscapulohermal muscular dystrophy.\n\n\u201cWe are certainly disappointed with these results,\u201d Habib Dable, Acceleron\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, in this case, the data show no evidence of such a benefit and, therefore, do not support further development of ACE-083 for FSHD.\u201d\n\nThe company is expecting Phase 2 data on the drug in another rare disease, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, in the first quarter of next year.\n\nIn a note on Tuesday, Citi Research analyst Yigal Nochomovitz cut his price target on Acceleron to $52, from $61, but maintained a Buy rating on the stock. \u201cThe FSHD failure was in-line with our expectations,\u201d Nochomovitz wrote. He said he cut his target for the stock price after removing from his model revenues for the drug from both facioscapulohermal muscular dystrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth.\n\nSVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges cut his price target on Acceleron to $55 from $62, but maintained his Outperform rating. JPMorgan \u2019s Eric Joseph, meanwhile, cut his price target to $56 from $58. He also kept the stock at Overweigh.\n\nLooking ahead. In his note on Tuesday, JPMorgan\u2019s Joseph wrote that investors\u2019 focus for the company is \u201cprimarily on luspatercept.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong-term, we remain fundamentally bullish on the commercial potential of luspatercept across a diversity of dysplastic anemia indications (under-reflected at current levels), which forms the basis of our Overweight rating,\u201d Joseph wrote.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "The company said it was discontinuing development of an experimental drug meant to treat facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.", "authors": ["Josh Nathan-Kazis"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-83976/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
