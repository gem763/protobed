That\u2019s the issue.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018My only son\u2019 \u2013\n\nLion Air, Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest carrier by fleet size, said Friday\u2019s report was \u201cessential to determine the root cause and contributing factors to the accident and take immediate corrective actions\u201d.\n\nThe FAA said it the grounded single-aisle jet would only return to service only after it determined the model is safe.\n\nAfter receiving a briefing on the report this week ahead of its public release, some of the victims\u2019 relatives expressed disappointment.\n\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019ve got no choice but to accept the report,\u201d said Epi Syamsul Qomar, who lost his son, after families met with investigators in Jakarta.\n\n\u201cPeople keep telling me to let go, to stay strong, but how do I do that? It\u2019s not that easy. He was my only son and I miss him every day.\u201d", "description": "Jakarta (AFP) \u2013 A design flaw, inadequate pilot training and poor flight crew performance contributed to a Boeing jet crashing in Indonesia last", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/8a492e_29-boeing-crash-was-months-by-involving-model-in-ethiopia-boeing-design-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
