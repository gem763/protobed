His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace.\u201d\n\nMonica Mutsvangwa, the minister of information, confirmed the death, saying: \u201cYes, it is really saddening. Some of us were like his children to him. We can never write our history without mentioning him.\u201d\n\nFrom liberation fighter to deposed leader \u2013 Robert Mugabe's life in pictures Read more\n\nThe death of the former president, who ruled Zimbabwe for close to four decades before being ousted in a military takeover in November 2017, marks the definitive end of an era in the history of the former British colony.\n\nMugabe is believed to have died in Singapore, where he had made frequent visits to receive medical care in recent months as his health deteriorated. As far back as November 2018, Mnangagwa, who took over from him as president, told members of the ruling Zanu-PF party that Mugabe could no longer walk.\n\nThough once widely celebrated for his role in fighting the white supremacist regime in his homeland, Mugabe had long become a deeply divisive figure in his own country and across the continent.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emmerson Mnangagwa at a rally in November 2018.

The news of his decision prompted widespread rejoicing.\n\nEarly reactions to Mugabe\u2019s death underlined the controversial nature of his life and mixed legacy.\n\nThe ruling African National Congress party in neighbouring South Africa described Mugabe as a \u201cfriend, statesman and revolutionary comrade\u201d. In a statement, the ANC acknowledged that it had sometimes \u201cdiffered vociferously\u201d with him, but remembered \u201can ardent and vocal advocate of African unity and self-reliance\u201d whose struggle had been an inspiration.\n\nTimeline Robert Mugabe Show Hide Mugabe is born in what was then British-ruled Southern Rhodesia. He is educated at Catholic schools and attends South Africa's University of Fort Hare. During the 1940s and 50s he teaches in Zambia and Ghana, where he is influenced by African independence movement leaders. After campaigning for Zimbabwe's independence, he is imprisoned for political agitation. While incarcerated, he earns two law degrees from the University of London. Released from prison, he escapes to Mozambique where Zimbabwe African National Union guerrilla fighters elect him to lead their struggle against white minority rule. Mugabe's Zanu-PF party wins independent Zimbabwe's first election and he takes office as prime minister. Mugabe deploys North Korean-trained troops to crush an insurgency by former guerrillas loyal to his liberation war rival Joshua Nkomo. Government forces are accused of involvement in the killing of 20,000 civilians, which Mugabe denies. Mugabe becomes president with sweeping executive powers after changes to the constitution and signs a unity pact with Nkomo, who becomes one of his two deputies. In 1990, Zanu-PF and Mugabe win further parliamentary and presidential elections. An economic crisis marked by high interest rates and inflation sparks riots. Zimbabweans reject a new constitution in a referendum, Mugabe's first defeat at the ballot box. Thousands of independence war veterans and their allies, backed by the government, seize white-owned farms, saying the land was illegally appropriated by white settlers. The US puts a financial freeze on Mugabe's government in response to land seizures, beginning a wave of sanctions against his regime. Mugabe wins a disputed presidential vote, which observers condemn as flawed. Zimbabwe is suspended from the British Commonwealth over accusations of human rights abuses and economic mismanagement. Hyperinflation reaches 500bn per cent, forcing millions of people to leave the country. Mugabe loses a presidential vote but wins the run-off after opponent Morgan Tsvangirai withdraws, citing violence against his supporters. A power-sharing agreement is signed. Despite reports saying Mugabe has been seriously ill with cancer, he wins another disputed presidential vote. Western observers cite multiple accounts of electoral fraud. After protesters stage the biggest show of defiance against Mugabe in a decade, he is forced to resign following an army coup and is replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa. Mugabe dies aged 95.\n\nNelson Chamisa, leader of the main opposition party in Zimbabwe, the Movement for Democratic Change, said: \u201cA giant has fallen.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though [we] had great political differences with the late former president, we recognise his immense contribution to the liberation struggle,\u201d Chamisa wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn the decades since Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain in 1980, power had concentrated in Mugabe\u2019s hands. Before Mnangagwa took over, an entire generation of Zimbabweans knew no other leader.\n\nAfter his fall, Mugabe was granted the status of a respected father of the nation and a generous pension by the new government. The move angered his many opponents and upset many of the victims of his regime.\n\nZimbabwe's intellectual despot: how Mugabe became Africa's fallen angel Read more\n\nBut Mugabe\u2019s own frustration and sense of humiliation over his ousting were clear, and voiced with typical rhetorical force at an extraordinary press conference in the grounds of his residence in Harare, the capital, days before elections in July 2018.\n\nMugabe, flanked by his wife, suggested he would vote for the opposition MDC, a party he had brutally suppressed before co-opting it in 2008 to form a supposed unity government that he still dominated.\n\nUntil the end he retained friends on the African continent but increasingly became an international pariah. Mugabe was stripped of an honorary knighthood by the British government in 2008.\n\nEducated at Catholic missionary schools, Mugabe became a teacher in Ghana then returned to Rhodesia in 1960 to fight white minority rule. He was jailed for 10 years and fled to neighbouring Mozambique, where he became one of the leaders of the guerrilla forces fighting Ian Smith\u2019s regime.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mugabe, left, with George Silundika and Joshua Nkomo in Tanzania in the 1960s.

He led the country through a golden period of economic growth and educational development that was the envy of Africa.\n\nThe international community turned a blind eye, however, to human rights abuses, most notably the 1980s ethnic cleansing of at least 20,000 people in Matabeleland province that crushed opposition from his rival Joshua Nkomo, the leader of the rival Zapu.\n\nOpposition rose again in 1999 as the economy floundered and trade unions organised around the Movement for Democratic Change. Mugabe rigged elections and began a programme of land reform in which white farmers were forcibly evicted to make way for Zanu-PF party cronies or black Zimbabweans who lacked the skills and capital to farm.\n\nThis helped throw the economy into disarray, leaving Zimbabweans to rely on foreign food aid to avoid starvation. Hyperinflation ran riot and supermarket shelves were empty. The once-proud school and health systems began to crumble.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mugabe election posters of are covered in opposition MDC slogans, in Harare, 2008.

More than 200 people died in political violence around the 2008 election, which Mugabe was widely seen as having stolen from the MDC\u2019s Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\nThe late John Makumbe, a politics professor at the University of Zimbabwe, said: \u201cHe\u2019ll be remembered as a villain. His legacy was destroyed by his staying, his violence, his imposing his own political allies and rivals.\n\n\u201cRobert Mugabe always had the seed of bad governance, cruelty, selfishness: \u2018It\u2019s only me who matters.\u2019 He came in 1980 and donors flooded in; Mugabe looked angelic, he took on the colour of his surroundings. But by 2000 he had to rig elections and the rot had set in.\n\n\u201cThe chameleon has its own colour: when it\u2019s frightened, it takes on its original colour, and it\u2019s ugly. He showed his true colours. His true colour is a killer. He killed his enemies.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert and Grace Mugabe.
