Slick.\n\nAnthony Watson 7\n\nAlways seemed to find pockets of space to make a gain every time on the wing.\n\nManu Tuilagi 8\n\nGot England off to the perfect start with his early try. Made sure England won the midfield battle.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOwen Farrell 7\n\nHobbled around in the first half but bravely played on and dictated play.\n\nJonny May 7\n\nSome monster hits and England lost some of their attacking flair when he went off.\n\nGeorge Ford 8\n\nA wand of a right foot. Just one penalty miss all evening. Dominated the game from fly-half.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBen Youngs 8\n\nUnfortunate to have a cheeky try ruled out but otherwise a solid performance.\n\nMako Vunipola 8\n\nLed from the front line. Put his body on the line at every oppurtinuty.\n\nJamie George 6\n\nNever seemed to really find the pace of the game and gave his side a worrying moment with an overthrow.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nKyle Sinckler 7\n\nForced off with an injury but worked hard at the breakdown.\n\nMaro Itoje 9\n\nHit after hit after hit. Hard to think of a tackle he missed all game. Massive performance.\n\nCourtney Lawes 8\n\nPure power. Was at his best at the line-up, where England dominated.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTom Curry 8\n\nImmense alongside Underhill. Did more than anyone to disrupt New Zealand.\n\nSam Underhill 9 MOTM\n\nSuperhero display. Seemed to be everywhere in attack and defence with some incredible tackles. Every All Black will have a bruise from his shoulders. His disallowed would simply have been a cherry on his night.\n\nBilly Vunipola\n\nOn his 50th appearance probably put in his best performance. Masterclass.\n\nReplacements - The cavalry provided momentum at a time when New Zealand were already beaten. Henry Slade put in a shift at full-back. 8", "description": "England stunned New Zealand with a superb display to reach the Rugby World Cup final", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Reuters", "Pa", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728468.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-v-New-Zealand-2019-Rugby-World-Cup-Semi-Final-International-Stadium-Yokohama.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
