On this week's New Music Friday, we dig into this expansive mix of slow-burning ballads and sometimes strange but profound, odyssey-length adventures.\n\nAlso, on the show: The artist known as Boy Scouts releases an album of love and empathy for her Anti Records debut; Black Belt Eagle Scout celebrates the power of friendship on a full-length that comes less than a year after her previous album; and The Boston emo band Somos has a new album just weeks after the band's guitarist, Phil Haggerty, tragically passed away at the age of 28. All those, plus Sheryl Crow's features-heavy (and reportedly final) album, the Australian singer G Flip and more. NPR Music's Lars Gotrich, Marissa Lorusso and Stephen Thompson join host Robin Hilton to share their picks for the best new albums out Aug. 30.\n\nFeatured Albums:\n\nG Flip - About Us\n\nFeatured Song: \"Drink Too Much\" Boy Scouts - Free Company\n\nFeatured Song: \"Expiration Date\" Black Belt Eagle Scout - At The Party With My Brown Friends\n\nFeatured Song: \"I Said I Wouldn't Write This Song\" Lana Del Rey - Norman F****** Rockwell\n\nFeatured Songs: \"Happiness Is A Butterfly\" and \"Cinnamon Girl\" Close Talker - How Do We Stay Here\n\nFeatured Song: \"Wait\" Somos - Prison On A Hill\n\nFeatured Song: \"Absent And Lost\" Sheryl Crow: Threads\n\nFeatured Song: \"Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\"\n\nOther Notable Releases For Aug. 30: Bon Iver - i.i (physical release); Common - Let Love; The Futureheads - Powers; Joan Shelley - Like The River Loves The Sea; Pharmakon - Devour; Tool - Fear Inoculum; Trisha Yearwood - Every Girl; Whitney - Forever Turned Around.", "description": "Our shortlist for the week's best new albums includes Lana Del Rey's odyssey-length adventure Norman F****** Rockwell, Sheryl Crow's final album, Threads, new Black Belt Eagle Scout and more.", "authors": ["Robin Hilton", "Stephen Thompson", "Marissa Lorusso", "Lars Gotrich"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/08/29/img_3575_wide-46aef8e3735bba0a7d8696617603c7cf399c7a90.jpeg?s=1400"}
