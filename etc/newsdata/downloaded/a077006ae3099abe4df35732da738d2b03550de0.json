Nobel Prize? I\u2019m not afraid to say it. The futuristic scene is full of lights, holograms, and advertisements. (An excellent way to use product placement in your music video? Set it in 2095 Times Square.) Skai Jackson is using Uber, hopping flights, and hopping out of flights to get away from Lil Nas X and his dancing robot friends, who insist she\u2019s being a \u201cmeanie.\u201d She is sick and tired of him acting foolish! It does not matter how clean the robots can hit the whoa. At the end, he turns the onslaught of advertisements into a gorgeous array of hologram trees. The \u201cPanini\u201d music video was directed by Mike Diva and the story is by none other than Lil Nas X. We get it, Lil Nas X, you\u2019re multitalented! We\u2019re very jealous. Rub some off on us before you go.\n\nRelated", "description": "Lil Nas X\u2019s \u2018Panini\u2019 music video is officially out!
