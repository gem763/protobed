Questions will abound \u2014 of the candidates, between the candidates and, afterward, about who may or may not have \u201cwon\u201d the night, all in the service of helping voters decide who might be best suited to lead. An important question that should be asked and won\u2019t, however, isn\u2019t for the candidates at all but for higher education: \u201cAre you ready to lead?\u201d Sadly, the answer is, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, I fully expect plenty of discussion about higher education at the debate \u2014 its high costs, student debt, workforce shortages and the difficulty of change. I just hope the candidates don\u2019t hold back in calling to account higher education itself simply because we happen to be their hosts. There is plenty of blame to go around with the challenges in higher education today, and higher education institutions themselves own a fair share of it.\n\nPerhaps no issue contributes more to higher education\u2019s affordability problems than institutions\u2019 \u2014 and parents\u2019 \u2014 preoccupation with \u201cprestige.\u201d Exclusivity and selectivity are thought to be hallmarks of quality, which fosters a system that rewards institutions for perpetually raising admission standards and prices. The problem with this is that test scores \u2014 the most frequently-used metric for a student\u2019s academic strength \u2014 generally track with a family\u2019s income. Students from higher-wealth families have higher test scores and more frequently gain entrance to \u201cselective\u201d institutions, which steadily become less and less diverse.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo essentially segregate students by their parents\u2019 income this way, however, is un-American and does nothing to enrich an education or advance quality in research or instruction. It is the inevitable product, though, of a mindset that \u201cselective\u201d and high rankings are the top priorities in higher education. This is a falsehood that needs to be turned upside down.\n\nWhat if, instead of prestige, advancing social good was higher education\u2019s priority metric, and higher education administrators, parents and students alike understood its power in recruiting both top-notch professors and students? It\u2019s achievable, and it happens by serving all deserving students through transparent financial aid, predictable costs and career-driven curricula.\n\nFew students pay the full list price of a four-year education because most colleges, public and private, spend a great deal of their own resources on financial aid. Still, that \u201csticker price\u201d can be daunting to first-generation and low-income students, causing them to think college is out of reach. So, this pricing shell game actually can drive away deserving students.\n\nIt would be better if institutions simplified the needlessly complicated financial aid system, priced tuition realistically and better targeted financial assistance. Diversity would increase, actual costs would be easily understood the first time, and institutions would bring in the same amount of tuition revenue.\n\nStaying in school means continuing to be able to afford school. However, the average national tuition rates have increased eight times the rate of family income over the past 30 years, which means students and families experience big cost increases once they\u2019re \u201chooked\u201d at an institution. In fact, institutions count on it, but it\u2019s yet another game colleges play \u2014 and it\u2019s wrong. Good fiscal management can allow institutions to set tuition four years in advance, with reasonable growth rates, so families can plan. Several Ohio institutions, including Otterbein, have found ways to do this. It\u2019s not rocket science.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter graduation, students and families focus next on the job market, justifiably expecting their four years\u2019 worth of study and money to set them up to compete in the job market. Far too often, however, institutions\u2019 programs are misaligned with employers\u2019 needs, and institutions are to blame. Higher education must do more than just hope their programs teach in-demand skills and, instead, need to actually talk with employers about what they want from employees. Far too many in higher education believe this type of engagement is beneath them and that the ivory tower of academia is somehow diminished by contact with the real world of commerce. Higher education needs to get real.\n\nOtterbein doesn\u2019t do all of this right, but we see ourselves and the challenge of equitable access with clear eyes, and work to improve by constantly reminding ourselves that higher education is about service \u2014 to all. Rediscovering the service ethic at the heart of teaching and research can allow higher education to once again play the role our country so badly needs \u2014 the place that prepares the next generation of Americans to be the thinkers and leaders of a free society.\n\nJohn Comerford is president of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.
