Pair that with the dense fog and it doesn't exactly make for safe conditions.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nStill, there are two observation decks around the rim of the caldera lake, from which you can enjoy some pretty incredible panoramic views of the lake and its surroundings.\n\nEven on misty days, the fog tends to be quite low so while it obscures views of the water, you can still take in the scenery.\n\nThere is also a hiking trail which measures about seven kilometres and takes you through the forest and grasslands if you do want to make the most of the great outdoors.\n\nBecause of its remote nature, the lake is easiest to reach by car, although there are some (infrequent) bus services from early February to mid March, and from April to November.\n\nYou can find out more on the official website .", "description": "It's said to have the world's most crystal-clear waters but visitors may not actually want to see them", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528967.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Lake-Mashu-of-blue.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
