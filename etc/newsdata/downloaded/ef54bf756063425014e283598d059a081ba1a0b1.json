Hong Kong protesters expressed their fellowship with the Taiwanese by raising the ROC flag, a gesture that will prove enormously irritating to the Communist government, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\n\nAlso the Republic of China (Taiwan)\u2019s National Day, crowds are beginning to gather in the evening at various malls across #HongKong \u2014 vowing to recreate scenes in the 1950s when the city\u2019s streets were filled with ROC rather than PRC flags.

The current Kuomintang party in Taiwan is pro-China and opposed to the Democratic Progressive Party of sitting President Tsai Ing-wen.\n\nThe ROC flag is much more strongly associated with the modern Taiwanese government than the original Kuomintang, and in any event the Chinese Communist Party does not care for either of them, as the producers of a big-budget Chinese war movie that inadvertently glorified the Kuomintang discovered to their sorrow in June.\n\nPresident Tsai tipped her hat to the Hong Kong protesters in her National Day speech and cited the unrest in that semi-autonomous city as a reason for Taiwan to reject the same type of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement:\n\nMy fellow citizens, when freedom and democracy are challenged, and when the Republic of China\u2019s existence and development are threatened, we must stand up and defend ourselves. The overwhelming consensus among Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people is our rejection of \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d regardless of party affiliation or political position. The Republic of China has stood tall on Taiwan for over 70 years. But if we were to accept \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d there would no longer be room for the Republic of China\u2019s existence. As President, standing up to protect national sovereignty is not a provocation \u2014 it is my fundamental responsibility.\n\nTsai is currently running about 13 points ahead of Kuomintang candidate Han Kuo-yu in Tawian\u2019s January presidential election. The Straits Times on Thursday suggested her lead has been boosted by \u201cthe multiple battles Beijing is fighting,\u201d from \u201chalting broadcasts of some United States National Basketball Association games to a protracted trade war with President Donald Trump and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nTaiwan\u2019s National Day commemoration was attended by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), the first sitting American senator to attend the event in Taipei in 35 years.\n\n\u201cAt this time, when the eyes of the world are focused on Hong Kong and the brutal repression of Hong Kong, the stakes of fighting for democracy and fighting for freedom are that much more important, and that is what Taiwan rightly symbolizes for the world,\u201d Cruz said at a meeting with President Tsai.", "description": "Hong Kong protesters fly the Taiwanese flag to commemorate Taiwan's National Day, the anniversary of the Republic of China's founding.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1174963908-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
