If there\u2019s a dominant trend in Paris, it\u2019s how extravagant and theatrical Fashion Week has become. The Spring 2020 ready-to-wear shows, which wrapped up on Tuesday\u2014as the country mourned the loss of its former leader Jacques Chirac\u2014proved the point.\n\nThink a skateboard-meets-dance inspired performance from the Japanese tech whiz Issey Miyake. The Paris regular dressed models live on the runway. Clothing descended from metal contraptions hanging in the rafters, decking the models in bouncy dresses that showed off Miyake\u2019s technical artistry.\n\nThe designs folded flat but sprung into life on the body. Then there were the deformed Marie-Antoinette style creatures who wheeled prams through the historic interiors of the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts for the freakish Thom Browne show.\n\nMeanwhile, India\u2019s fashion giant, Manish Arora, showed off a fashion-week installation that included sassy drag queens wearing make-up richer than his customary, psychedelic Indian embroidery; hippie boy performers with loud tattoos, singing soppy songs; and a perky hostess with green hair and matching pointy glasses.\n\nAnd who could forget the edgy Georgian designer Demna Gvasalia\u2019s finale for Balenciaga with its shimmering, oversized, golden ball gowns fit for Versailles? Yes, some of this season\u2019s ready-to-wear looked more like couture.\n\nIn some cases, the shows eclipsed the designs\u2014as when prankster Vitalii Sediuk latched on to Justin Timberlake's ankle, and when comedian Marie S'Infiltre (real name Marie Benoliel) stormed the runway at Chanel, only to be marched off the runway by Gigi Hadid.\n\nBut, even beyond the entertaining nature of the shows, Paris debuted some wild and weird clothing creations, proving it is still the fashion capital of the world. Some of our favorites:\n\nManish Arora\n\nWe\u2019ve heard of buying shoes to match your outfit, but how about matching make-up and hair plume? Consider this colorfully embellished, full-length cream dress, decked in unicorns and stars, worn with matching face paint.\n\nDemna Gvasalia\n\nThe edgy streetwear designer, who joined Balenciaga as Artistic Director in 2015, sent a series of outlandish ball gowns down the runway\u2014some worn by male models\u2014that were gigantic, loud, and bold. They were the finale to a collection inspired by workers, which included both suits cut in varying proportions, and shimmering, skin-tight bodysuits featuring tiger stripes.\n\nIssey Miyake\n\nThe veteran Japanese designer knows a thing or two about applying technology to fashion to create mesmerizing pieces that double as design objects. This season, he also created one of the most memorable shows at an edgy performing arts center where local performers go to practice. Miyake\u2019s models danced and skate-boarded their way through the venue, celebrating the joy of spring in bright, bouncy pieces.\n\nThom Browne\n\nWho could forget the platform Beetle shoes this season, worn with pastel suits that looked like they had been etched upon the body? Or the weird and wonderful deconstructed crinoline designs, matched with school-boy ties and skeleton-like bodices, and paired with lavish hair-do\u2019s worn under net veils, to create one-off pieces for Spring 2020 at Thom Browne?\n\nDries Van Noten\n\nWhat would Patsy and Eddy, the rebel stars of the hit British sit-com Absolutely Fabulous, have made of this season\u2019s surprise collaboration between Belgian Design sophisticate Dries Van Noten and the flamboyant Christian Lacroix? Think bold Dries prints and OTT Lacroix skirts and big accessories.\n\nMaison Margiela\n\nThe house that bears the name of Belgium\u2019s weirdest living designer, Martin Margiela (he\u2019s been a recluse since 2009), is these days designed by infamous Dior expat John Galliano, who dedicated this season to the ordinary men and women who worked to fight the Nazi occupation of France.\n\nLouis Vuitton\n\nPresenting eccentric designs that were beautiful but not too crazy was how Louis Vuitton closed the week with the last show of the season on Tuesday. Think an elegant checked blouse worn under a busy metallic tank-top etched in zigzags, and demure black trousers.\n\nRahul Mishra\n\nIndia\u2019s rising star showed just what you can do when you harness the craftsmanship of the people of the small villages of India, and match that with his eye for international design. You can\u2019t get more beautiful than this with embroidery and fluffy, hand-sewn layered cuts.\n\nVivienne Westwood\n\nIf you want eccentric, you can\u2019t go wrong with the grande dame of Punk and New Wave fashion, Vivienne Westwood, whose house is designed these days by husband Andreas Kronthaler.\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons\n\nThere isn\u2019t anybody like the Japanese design genius Rei Kawakubo when it comes to creating art-like fashion. She doesn\u2019t often say much. But consider this season\u2019s examination of a boy who becomes a woman. This operatic collection\u2014inspired by Kawakubo\u2019s collaboration with Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth for an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel Orlando, to premiere in December in Vienna\u2014featured rich materials, odd puffy shapes, deconstructed designs from yesteryear, and red dreadlocks that poured like blood over the costumes.", "description": "The Spring 2020 ready-to-wear shows, which wrapped up in Paris on Tuesday, showed just how proudly extravagant and theatrical the city's Fashion Week has become.", "authors": ["Liza Foreman"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3060,w_5440,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570117882/191002-Foreman-embed1_aazlcy"}
