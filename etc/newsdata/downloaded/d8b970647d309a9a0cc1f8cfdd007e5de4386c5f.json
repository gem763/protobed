This requires a serious response, including rethinking how we manage our road network.'\n\nShe added: 'We cannot ignore the looming fiscal black hole. We need to ask how we will pay for roads in the future and in answering that question we have an opportunity for a much wider debate about our use of road space, cutting carbon emissions, tackling congestion, modal shift and how we prioritise active travel.\n\n'Tackling the Climate Emergency is essential but this is about more than what we must do to meet that challenge. It's also about our health and the sort of towns and cities we want to live in.'\n\nNicholas Lyes, RAC head of roads policy, said previous surveys by the motoring group found that drivers are open to a new form of motoring taxation but three-quarters are worried they may end up paying more tax than they do now.\n\n'For this reason, we believe any new tax should be in place of the current one and not in addition to it,' Lyes said.\n\n'Our research also suggests that a sizeable number of drivers would see a 'per mile' road pricing option as fairer than the current system of paying fuel duty, and there is a large level of support for the principle of the 'more you drive, the more you pay.\n\n'In addition, drivers tell us that any \"pay per mile\" system of road pricing would make them consider cutting out short journeys.'\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that fuel duty alone will generate \u00a328.4bn in the financial year 2019/20\n\nEdmund King, president at the AA, has been calling for the Government to modify the scheme to a 'Road Miles' policy.\n\nWith this scheme motorists would receive at least 3,000 free road miles each year, tracked by a telematics dongle in the car.\n\nOnce motorists go over that allowance they would be charged 1p per mile in the first year after the free miles and fuel duty discounts are deducted.\n\n'We do need a national debate about how we pay for our road infrastructure to bridge the taxation gap between falling fuel duty revenue and the electric vehicle revolution,' Mr King said in response to last week's announcement.\n\n'However, the British public will never vote for 'national road pricing' so we need greater imagination to sell the public something that they actually want \u2013 our answer is Road Miles.\n\n'In Road Miles drivers pay less, more is spent on roads, tunnels, cycling, buses and the Government gets \u00a32billion extra per year.'", "description": "Road pricing efforts could include tolls, congestion charges, HGV levies, workplace parking fees, plus low emission and clean air zones.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
