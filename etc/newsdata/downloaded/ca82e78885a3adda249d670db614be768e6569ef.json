The control group doesn\u2019t get the glasses. Question: How much better do the glasses-children do in learning to read?\n\nThe idea is to imitate in economics what is called in medicine the \u201cgold standard\u201d of randomized trials. The makers of field experiment claim they mine scientific gold. If the glasses-children do a lot better in reading, then the economists can recommend the policy of giving eyeglasses to children with poor vision, like recommending a baby aspirin a day if you\u2019ve already had a heart attack. Doctor\u2019s orders. Give the kids eyeglasses, do not give people mosquito nets, and on and on to thousands of medical-economic prescriptions. World poverty solved. And above all we\u2019ve been scientific about it.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nPlenty. The eyeglass example is not hypothetical. Three followers of the Nobelists, the economists Glewwe, Park and Zhao, reported in 2012 on its success for 19,000 school children with bad sight. With financing from the World Bank, thousands were given glasses at $2 a pair, and did learn Chinese characters. Thousands were not given glasses, and didn\u2019t.\n\nAny problems here? In 2016, two other economists, Stephen T. Ziliak and Edward R. Teather-Posadas, studied the experiment. They uncovered devastating errors in the use of statistics by the field experimenters and their supporters. Many other economists, such as the Nobelists Angus Deaton and James Heckman, also have grave worries of a technical sort about field experiments. A big one is inferring from a study in a locale to a recommendation for a national policy. Educational experiments have been misleading this way, as the philosopher of science Nancy Cartwright has argued.\n\nBut Messrs. Ziliak and Teather-Posadas make also the, shall we say, blindingly obvious point that we know already that a child who cannot see will not be able to read the alphabet, not to speak of hundreds of Chinese characters. The experiment is, to use a technical word, stupid. It\u2019s like the joke about the experiment to test whether parachutes work. Throw 10 people with parachutes out of an airplane at 5,000 feet. Then throw 10 without. Science satisfied.\n\nMessrs. Ziliak and Teather-Posadas remark that the eyeglasses experiment, and a good deal of the work of the Nobelists, is as startlingly unethical, and stupid, as the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment run from 1931 to as late as 1971. African-American men were randomly assigned to not get the penicillin that the medical scientists from the U.S. Department of Health already knew cured the disease.\n\nThe economists, like the medical researchers, seem to have lost touch with their proper role. They are not ethically assigned to master our lives. The mastering assignment is what they assume when they focus on \u201cpolicy,\u201d understood as tricking or bribing or coercing people to do what\u2019s best. It sounds fine, until you realize that it is what your mother did to you when you were 2 years old, and had properly stopped doing to you by the time you were 21. The field experimenters scorn adult liberty. And that is the other way many economists have lost touch. As noted by economist William Easterly, another critic of the experimental work, and as argued at length by your reporter in numerous books, the real way to solve world poverty is liberty. Not dubious, fiddly, bossy little policies handed down from the elite.\n\nHow do Mr. Easterly and I know? We look around as economic scientists, and see that when India in 1991 gave up Gandhian illiberalism, and when China in 1978 gave up Maoist illiberalism, and when Japan in 1868 gave up Tokugawan illiberalism, and when in 1776 the Blessed Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cThe Wealth of Nations\u201d crushed the case for illiberalism, the poor were enriched. By 3,000 percent.\n\nAnd the Nobel committee seems to have lost touch with actual science, which does not make a fetish out of method, which closely watches its ethics, and which is guided by actual, non-stupid curiosities. When the great physicist, a Nobel winner, Richard Feynman suspected that the Challenger disaster had happened because the seals hardened and broke on an unusually cold day, he tested it by dunking a piece of the rubber seal into a glass of ice water, and breaking it in front of the other commissioners. When the historian Lord Acton found that power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, he got it from a lifetime of studying how all great men are bad. That\u2019s science. Even economic science.\n\n\u2022 Deirdre Nansen McCloskey is an economist and historian.
