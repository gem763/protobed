But few current roles show women in powerful positions, and continue to reinforce damaging gender stereotypes.\n\nDavis was speaking to the Guardian as research into the film industry showed that of characters in leadership positions, women were four times more likely than men to be shown completely naked. The study also found that 42% of men were shown in leadership roles, compared with 27% of women.\n\n\u201cWe know from many examples that media images can be incredibly powerful in a positive way if you bother to do that,\u201d Davis told the Guardian. \u201cMy theory is we don\u2019t have enough real-life role models of women in important positions and occupations to inspire change, and so we need to have them in fiction so that life will imitate art.\n\n\u201cI believed all the press reaction about Thelma and Louise, that it was going to change everything and that there were now going to be far more female lead characters in movies, and I was thrilled.\n\n\u201cAnd actually the next move I made, A League of Their Own, the press announced the same thing, that now absolutely for sure everything is going to change. There\u2019ll be so many sports movies now. And none of those things happened.\n\n\u201cOver the 25 years since, there have been a number of times that movies have come out and people [have said], \u2018This is going to change things,\u2019 and it didn\u2019t,\u201d added Davis, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Thelma in the 1991 film.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly disappointing how little progress has been made.\u201d\n\nResearch published on Tuesday analysed the film industry\u2019s portrayal of women and its impact on the lives of girls, carried out by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, which the actor founded in 2004, and the NGO Plan International.\n\nIt analysed the 56 top-grossing films of 2018 in 20 countries in North America, Scandinavia, Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe.\n\nOf the characters in leadership positions, it found that women and girls were four times more likely than men to be shown wearing revealing clothing; nearly twice as likely to be shown as partially nude; and four times more likely to be shown completely naked. It also found that when a slow motion focus was used on lead characters\u2019 bodies, nearly twice as many female leads were sexually objectified than men.\n\nResearch also revealed that twice as many men appeared in the 56 films and they spoke twice as much as women.\n\nMale characters were shown as being more effective and more respected when in leadership positions, while female presidents and prime ministers were portrayed as struggling with the job. Where female characters were portrayed as strong, it was in the home.\n\nAlmost half of the characters across the films analysed, which collectively earned $21bn (\u00a317bn) at the box office, were white. Only one of the 60 female leaders in the films was LGBTQ+. None of the films was directed by a woman, only a quarter had at least one female producer and one in 10 had at least one woman on the writing team.\n\nCommonwealth ministers look to revitalise progress on gender equality Read more\n\nIn the report, Rewrite her Story, 10,000 girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 25, in 19 countries, were polled about the role media played in shaping their aspirations and view of themselves.\n\nThe vast majority of those interviewed said they were influenced by what they saw on screen and wanted more role models. More than 90% said they believed women in leadership roles were treated less well because of their gender.\n\n\u201cOf course it hurts me because \u2026 even if I know I could be a leader, I won\u2019t do it because I see it is just for men, not for women,\u201d a 22-year-old Ugandan woman told researchers. \u201cSo that affects me. I\u2019ll have to sit back and watch men doing it, even though I am capable of doing it too.\u201d\n\nAnne-Birgitte Albrectsen, CEO of Plan International, said while \u201ca woman 007 or superhero in film is welcome \u2026 our research shows they are exceptions and not the rule\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe bigger picture is that gender discrimination and harmful stereotypes still dominate on screen. This undermines girls and young women and has a negative impact on their aspirations to leadership in all walks of life.\u201d\n\nDavis said she remained optimistic that things would improve. The #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements have had a \u201cremarkable\u201d impact on the industry. \u201cWe can feel change in the air,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI feel the easiest way to bring change in our culture is on-screen representation. And if you make it happen there, it will happen in real life.\u201d\n\nDavis, who this year joined Netflix wrestling drama Glow, played the ultimate leadership role \u2013 that of a female US president in the 2005 TV show Commander in Chief. It was axed by ABC after one series. But, she said, a study found that 58% of people said they were more likely to vote for a female candidate for president \u201cafter seeing me behind the desk\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cImagine if I had stayed on air for eight years, what would be happening now?\u201d", "description": "Actor speaks out as film industry study on characters in leadership roles finds women four times more likely than men to be shown naked", "authors": ["Liz Ford"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f3d1a6aff9f49935ab8ee714a9ef8087257b9da/648_127_2253_1352/master/2253.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d58de6bdb0e137b9ce2b806bdcb7c2fa", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
