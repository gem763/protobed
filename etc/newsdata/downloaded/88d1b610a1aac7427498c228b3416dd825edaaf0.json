The 2019 version of the tournament starts on November 8.\n\nThe other officials reportedly suspended are chief operating officer Naasei Appiah and sponsorship head Clive Eksteen.\n\nThe suspensions came a week after the South African Cricketers\u2019 Association (SACA), which represents professional players, declared a dispute with CSA over money it said was due to the players for commercial rights relating to the MSL 2018.\n\nCSA said it was investigating whether the suspended officials were \u201cderelict in fulfilling their duties\u201d and that disciplinary action could follow. It said all fees due to the players would be paid to SACA immediately.\n\nThe latest upheavals come at a time when the national team appears to be in disarray. Ottis Gibson and his coaching staff were fired after a poor World Cup campaign and a new structure was announced, with a team director to be appointed who would report to the director of cricket.\n\nVan Zyl, a long-time employee of CSA, was appointed interim director of cricket and Enoch Nkwe was made appointed interim team director following a successful season as coach of the Lions franchise.\n\nNkwe was in charge of the team that suffered three heavy defeats in three Tests in India earlier this month.\n\nApplications for the permanent posts close tomorrow. The first Test against England starts on December 26.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "No names were given but South African media reported that they included Corrie van Zyl, the interim director of cricket, who was seen as a front-runner for the full-time role", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/unnamed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
