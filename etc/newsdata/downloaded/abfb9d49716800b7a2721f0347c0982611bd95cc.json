Now a new inferno was bearing down on the region, and Culley feared he would lose everything. Again.\n\nParts of Northern California faced the prospect of new infernos and nearly a million power outages as a potentially \u201chistoric\u201d wind event was forecast to sweep into the state on Saturday, almost a year after the most destructive fire in California history left 85 people dead. Culley\u2019s anxiety is part of a grim new reality for a state hit by increasingly dangerous fire seasons and turning to drastic new prevention measures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe ongoing Kincade Fire, which sparked Wednesday night in Sonoma County and has already consumed more than 25,000 acres, is expected to worsen. Strong winds with low humidity will create what the National Weather Service called \u201cextreme fire weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen what a firestorm is, it\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d said Culley, the owner of KC\u2019s American Kitchen, his voice shaking. \u201cTo know that a monster could be coming this way, is really, really disturbing.\u201d\n\nOfficials issued new evacuation orders on Saturday, bringing the total to about 50,000. Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick urged residents to \u201cstart evacuating now,\u201d before the sun went down and precautionary power outages began. Residents along the Route 101 corridor from Geyserville to South Windsor were urged to leave their homes; forecasts indicated the fire could spread through that region in particular, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvacuees could find shelter at the Santa Rosa veterans memorial hall, as well as the Petaluma veterans hall and fair grounds, authorities said.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of 60 to 80 mph gusts through the mountain regions of Northern and Central California between Saturday night and Monday morning, with lesser, but still powerful, winds reaching valleys and coastal areas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an aggressive fire fight,\u201d said Edwin Duniga, spokesman for California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \u201cAll our firefighters have been told to keep an eye out, to be smart out there, be safe. Because terrain like this makes it hard for firefighters, and [makes it] super dangerous as the winds pick up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said proactive measures have helped prevent a blaze as bad as in previous years, even as six major wildfires rage around the state. This year\u2019s state budget includes an additional $1 billion toward emergency preparation, and authorities are increasingly deploying resources to high-risk areas before a fire breaks out, he said.\n\nAD\n\nBut the weather has officials fearful of another big blaze.\n\n\u201cThe next 72 hours are going to be challenging,\u201d Newsom said Saturday afternoon. I could sugar coat it, but I\u2019m not.\"\n\nThe wildfires come on the heels of the 2017 and 2018 California fire seasons, which featured the largest, most destructive, and deadliest blazes in state history. It\u2019s part of a clear pattern toward fires that are larger, more frequent and that stretch across a longer season. And, according to CalFire, \u201cclimate change is considered a key driver of this trend.\u201d Population growth and the increase in homes and businesses located near lands that typically burn are also escalating the risk of and damage from wildfires in the Golden State.\n\nAD\n\nForecasters at the Weather Service say this wind event could bring the most explosive wildfire conditions since the 2017 wine country fires, which damaged much of the city of Santa Rosa and killed 22 people.\n\nAD\n\nThe strong winds in the forecast will pose a high risk of sparks, which would lead to potentially rapidly spreading wildfires, Pacific Gas & Electric said in a statement Friday. Approximately 940,000 customers, comprising about 2.8 million people across Northern and Central California, could be without power through the weekend as PG&E stood ready to cut power beginning at 4 p.m. to the regions most at risk from the blaze.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, about 850 customers in Sonoma County did not have power due to the fire, or because of precautionary shut-offs, PG&E spokeswoman Suzanne Hosn said.\n\nAD\n\n#PSPS UPDATE: 2nd PSPS Impact Expands by 90k Customers\n\n\u2022 Total projected impact now 940k in portions of 36 counties\n\n\u2022 Power to be shutoff for safety in 6 zones starting @ approx 2PM today (weather dependent)\n\n\u2022 Address look-up: https://t.co/AUFB81ZXtQ pic.twitter.com/mBxz5dhc78 \u2014 PG&E (@PGE4Me) October 26, 2019\n\nThe weekend outage would mark the second major shut-off spurred by PG&E this month. Power cuts from the gas and electric company about two weeks ago left nearly 2 million people without power at its apex.\n\nAD\n\nHundreds of miles south, the winds had changed more favorably for firefighters in Los Angeles County, where significant progress was made in halting the Tick Fire. Since Thursday, the blaze had consumed more than 4,600 acres and prompted as many as 50,000 people to evacuate after strong seasonal winds caused flames to race through the densely populated canyon region. Nine homes were destroyed.\n\nA public works employee stumbled on human remains in a burned area of Santa Clarita, said Los Angeles County Sheriff spokeswoman Morgan Arteaga. But authorities are still investigating whether the unidentified individual\u2019s death is related to the fire.\n\nAD\n\nKarianna Bolstead was at her brother\u2019s home near Santa Clarita on Thursday evening when she saw flames burning through the chaparral of yards several feet away. She covered her mouth, ran down the hill back to her brother\u2019s home and yelled for him and his wife to leave. She fled in her own pickup truck, and spent a sleepless night pulled over on the side of the road after her cellphone died and she couldn\u2019t navigate through the thick, blinding smoke.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here since the \u201850s \u2014 I\u2019ve seen a lot of fires,\u201d said Bolstead. \u201cThis is the most volatile and explosive and fast-moving one I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe fire was 25 percent contained as of Saturday morning, and emergency crews were now focused on mitigating the hot spots left over from the line of flames and preventing embers from igniting new fires, said Capt. A.J. Lester of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.\n\nAD\n\nBy Saturday morning, an estimated 20,000-30,000 had been able to return to their homes, Lester said. Areas within the fire\u2019s perimeter remained under evacuation orders, and over 1,300 firefighters remained on the scene. Two evacuation centers for fleeing residents had been established at nearby schools, as well as a separate location for animals.\n\nLos Angeles County, as well as Sonoma County, have been under a state of emergency since Friday.\n\nAD\n\nAs Northern California prepares for a new onslaught from the Kincade Fire, PG&E is facing extreme scrutiny after reporting that though the utility said it cut power in Northern California on Wednesday, it had left stretches of high-voltage power transmission lines active in the region where the Sonoma County fire broke out. The same type of transmission line was responsible for the state\u2019s deadliest wildfire ever \u2014 the Camp Fire in 2018.\n\nAD\n\nThe company\u2019s shares plunged to $5 on Friday, a 30 percent decrease, MarketWatch reported. Such a tumble could hinder PG&E Corp.'s attempt to make its way out of bankruptcy. The utility filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January due to liabilities in previous fires.\n\nAt a Friday afternoon news conference, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said there have been discussions about PG&E\u2019s culpability, but they were not \u201cconclusive.\u201d The blame for the fire \u201cis neither determined nor is that investigation complete,\u201d he said, adding that he plans to hold the company accountable for \u201cyears and years of mismanagement.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPG&E chief executive Bill Johnson said the company is conducting an internal investigation but has not accepted responsibility for the fire, adding that officials don\u2019t know precisely how it started. \u201cWe still, at this point, do not know what exactly happened,\u201d he said at a Thursday news conference.\n\nThe scene as a fast-moving wildfire ignites in Northern California wine country share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Oct. 25, 2019 | A wind-driven wildfire continues to burn in Canyon Country, north of Los Angeles. (Gene Blevins/Reuters)\n\nSouth of Sonoma County\u2019s mandatory evacuation zones, residents scarred by the memory of the 2017 fires kept a wary on forecasts and made sure their backup generators were charged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all kind of on high alert and everybody has PTSD from the last fire,\u201d said Brent Bessire, an owner of Fogline Vineyards in Fulton, Calif. \u201cThis time you have a warning, people are getting more prepared.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, he and his family were clearing the brush around their facility to mitigate any possible fuel. The winery was closed, and they\u2019d been packing and trying to figure out what to do with their numerous animals, which included dogs, llamas and rabbits.\n\nBessire watched the glow of the Kincade fire from over a mountain ridge earlier this week, and the smoke had been wafting their way. On Saturday, he kept an eye to the north, waiting for the winds to start.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disconcerting, to say the least,\u201d he said.", "description": "PG&E is facing extreme scrutiny after reporting that, although the company said it cut power in Northern California on Wednesday, it had left stretches of high-voltage power transmission lines active in the region where the Sonoma County fire broke out.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CV1t8zNdMErMk4-TlgfwZC_HF3Y=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LCEBLHXXAYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
