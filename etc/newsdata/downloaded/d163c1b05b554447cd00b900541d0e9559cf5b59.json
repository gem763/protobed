Now it's center stage for his first debate\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Tom Steyer said he smiled when heard House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nSteyer founded Need to Impeach in October 2017 \u2014 a group with the singular goal of impeaching Trump. Since then, he has pumped millions of dollars into the group.\n\nIn doing so, he put his stamp on Trump's impeachment before many of the Democratic presidential candidates were even thinking about it \u2013 and he takes responsibility for helping to push the congressional investigations into Trump into a full-blown impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, Steyer told USA TODAY, \u201cwas a sign the American political system was working.\u201d\n\n\"The Need To Impeach movement has been around for almost two years, pushing and pushing and pushing,\" he said, as part of a \"drumbeat over two years of building momentum.\"\n\nNow, with House Democrats' impeachment inquiry rapidly escalating, Steyer finds himself making his first appearance on the debate stage while one of his signature issues is finally dominating headlines.\n\nWhile his political history is built around two organizations he has founded and funded \u2014 NextGen America, focused on climate change, and Need to Impeach \u2014 the debate will test his ability to stand out in the crowded Democratic field and move beyond being defined by those groups.\n\nOn stage: 12 candidates, one night: Here's who has made the October debate\n\nSteyer, 62, believes he has an opening in the field due to his relative lack of political experience compared with other candidates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an outsider, they\u2019re insiders,\u201d he said. Other than entrepreneur Andrew Yang, every other candidate on the Democratic debate stage is a current or former elected official.\n\nBut as fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., rails against the \u201cmillionaires and the billionaires\u201d on the campaign trail, Steyer is testing whether the Democratic primary electorate has the appetite for a billionaire presidential candidate to take on the current billionaire occupant of the White House.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate, Tom Steyer speaks to attendees during the Blue Jamboree on October 5, 2019 in North Charleston, South Carolina. More\n\n\u2018I met him in the streets\u2019\n\nSteyer made his fortune as the head of Farallon Capital, an investment firm that Steyer\u2019s biography says he started with $9 million in investments and eventually grew into a firm with $36 billion under its management at its peak. Forbes estimates Steyer's personal worth at $1.6 billion.\n\nHe left Farallon in 2012 seeking to get involved in politics and the environmental movement, starting NextGen in 2013. The group organized voters around environmental issues and its PAC, NextGen Action, spent millions of dollars on political races in the next several election cycles.\n\nHeather Hargreaves, Steyer\u2019s campaign manager and the former Executive Director of NextGen America, called him \u201ca really genuine person in the way that people don\u2019t expect.\u201d\n\nAfter years of participating from the sidelines, and months after saying he wouldn't join the race, Steyer threw his hat into the Democratic presidential contest in July.\n\nore: Gabbard considering boycotting October debate, claims DNC and media are 'trying to hijack' election\n\nSteyer\u2019s campaign points to his ties to the environmental movement and grassroots activism as evidence of his experience beyond the boardroom.\n\nRev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., a friend of Steyer and the head of the Hip Hop Caucus, a national youth voter outreach organization, told USA TODAY he first met Steyer at a February 2013 rally against the Keystone XL pipeline in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI met him in the streets,\u201d Yearwood recalls. He first noticed that Steyer was wearing a tie. At a rally.\n\n\"That\u2019s what stood out to me most,\" Yearwood said with a laugh.", "description": "With House Democrats' impeachment inquiry rapidly escalating, Steyer finds himself\u00a0making his first debate appearance while\u00a0one of his signature issues is finally dominating headlines.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X6irj8E00paa6IzY4aTdMQ--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/8c897fbf4b72655947d5f32a5ed4d1ea", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
