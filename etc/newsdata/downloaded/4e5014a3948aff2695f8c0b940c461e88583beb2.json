Kamala D. Harris of California ($11.6 million); businessman Andrew Yang ($10 million); Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey ($6 million); and Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado ($2.1 million).\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s campaign mocked Biden\u2019s fundraising haul Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cHA! We did that in 3 days,\u201d the campaign said in a tweet sent from its official account.\n\nBiden held a flurry of fundraisers in the third quarter in an effort to collect checks for his campaign. Some donors have questioned whether the former vice president would be able to stay at the front of the money pack after a tough quarter marred by gaffes and misstatements. They also worry about his ability to sustain momentum among small-dollar donors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the second quarter, Biden raised $21.5 million \u2014 one of the largest quarterly hauls reported during that time. But the third quarter is notoriously difficult for fundraising due to the summer lull, especially for candidates like Biden, who do not have an established base of small-dollar online donors.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has begun to eclipse Sanders\u2019s standing among the Democratic Party\u2019s most liberal voters, has not yet released her third-quarter fundraising totals.\n\nAD", "description": "Biden\u2019s third-quarter haul puts him behind Sen.
