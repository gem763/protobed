Ever since Canada fully legalized cannabis for adult recreational use last October, companies have struggled with losses and Kirk is expecting things to get worse; like other agricultural products, as yields per acre improve, profitability per acre will fall. U.S. growers in states that have legalized are facing the same dilemma.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., cultivators have indicated that their 2018 (roughly year three of most operations) profitability is down considerably,\u201d Kirk wrote. \u201cThe vast majority recently said they were break-even or profitable in year one. Now, in year three, the vast majority say they are unprofitable to break-even. We are already beginning to see the cracks in Canada: Pricing is down and consumption per federal license is contracting. To us, this means the future presents a less profitable system than exists today.\u201d\n\nKirk\u2019s comments come after a rough summer for the cannabis sector, with most stocks down by a double-digit percentage rate in the last three months. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, -0.47% has fallen about 29% in three months and is now down 6.7% in 2019.\n\nCannabis Watch: For all of MarketWatch\u2019s coverage of cannabis companies\n\nStocks have fallen amid a crop of scandals and some weaker-than-expected earnings from Canadian licensed players, that have dampened the hopes for big returns that some investors were expecting.\n\nSee also: Short sellers are increasing bets that cannabis stocks will fall\n\nKirk assigned sell ratings to Massachusetts-based Curaleaf Holdings Inc. CURLF, +1.01% CURA, +0.00% and Edmonton, Canada-based Aurora Cannabis Inc. ACB, -2.71% ACB, -2.34%, which was already smacked with a sell rating from Stifel analysts earlier this week.\n\nCuraleaf\u2019s valuation is looking stretched given that most of its retail sales are in Florida, where stores are showing declining productivity and where it has weak scores with customers, based on data from Yelp and Leafly, Kirk wrote.\n\n\u201cRecent acquisitions Select and Grassroots help the company diversify away from the problem (we estimate pro-forma net sales from Florida at ~20%),\u201d said the analyst. \u201cHowever, comparing Curaleaf retail to liquor retail metrics and valuation, Curaleaf would have to open 1,200-5,000 successful dispensaries to justify its shares\u2019 current valuation.\u201d\n\nSee also: Cannabis stocks turn higher after Curaleaf misses revenue estimates but offers bullish outlook\n\nKirk assigned the stock a C$5 ($3.8) price target, or half its current price of $10.08.\n\nFor Aurora, the issue is profitability, which Kirk expects will generally get worse before it gets better. Aurora\u2019s outsized exposure to medical cannabis relative to peers is another challenge to growth as most medical markets are showing flat to declining medical consumption.\n\n\u201cIn this light and with recent industry equity declines, we believe Aurora will have more difficulty refinancing some convertible notes coming due (March 2020),\u201d Kirk wrote. \u201cWe prefer companies that do not need funding before reaching profitability. Aurora will need some capital before its able to show positive EBITDA.\u201d\n\nSee: Alliance Global starts coverage of 4 cannabis stocks with buy ratings but not all gain\n\nThe analyst assigned neutral ratings to market leader Canopy Growth Corp. CGC, -2.96% WEED, -3.78% based in Smith Falls, Ontario, Tilray Inc. TLRY, -3.20% and Cronos Group Inc. CRON, +0.59% CRON, +0.00% He slapped buy ratings on New York-based Acreage Holdings Inc. ACRGF, +6.47% and Montreal, Canada-based Hexo Corp HEXO, +10.66% HEXO, +11.45%\n\nHEXO, +11.45% \u201cWe think retailers with a focus on recreational experience, strong real estate, and regulatory license moat or manufacturers focused on heavily processed product will offer the best chance at investor upside,\u201d said the note.\n\nCanopy shares were last down 3.4%, Tilray was up 0.3% and Cronos was up 0.6%. Acreage Holdings stock was up 1.6% and Hexo was up 6%.\n\nCuraleaf was down 4.3% and Aurora was down 1.6%.\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX, -0.49% was up 0.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.59% was up 0.3%.\n\nRead now: Cannabis companies have secret formulas to determine when the U.S. may allow pot sales", "description": "MKM Partners initiated coverage of five Canadian cannabis companies and two U.S. multi-state operators on Friday with a cautious outlook, arguing that the...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR765_kool_a_ZG_20190920121012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
