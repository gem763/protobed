Cultural events, overseas holidays, music festivals, even just time spent in beer gardens can all add up to a costly few months.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t want to spend a fortune then there are ways to enjoy a break for free or for a relatively low cost\u2026 as long as you don\u2019t mind rolling up your sleeves.\n\nFestivals for free (sort of)\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nGlasto, Reading, Beautiful Days\u2026 There are a lot of big and not-so-big music events coming up now the weather is warmer and that can mean spending a lot of money on tickets, assuming you\u2019re lucky enough to get them.\n\nBut it might be possible to spend time at a festival for free, while also doing some good: volunteering.\n\nOrganisations including Oxfam recruit an army of volunteers to work at these events, as shop workers, stewards and campaigners. The work and perks vary depending on which organisation you volunteer through, with Oxfam asking volunteers to do three 8-hour shifts per festival.\n\nVolunteers get phone charging, camping, food vouchers and when they are not working they can enjoy the event. It\u2019s even possible to sign up with friends and be put on the same rota, allowing you all to hang out together when the shifts are done.\n\n\u201cYou could be providing directions, checking wristbands, monitoring arenas and venues, or patrolling campsites,\u201d says Oxfam. \u201cYou\u2019ll be on viewing platforms, up fire towers, or roaming around the site as part of the response team.\u201d\n\nSwap homes for a holiday\n\nThere are so many companies offering to set would-be travellers up with others so they can exchange home and have a cheap holiday. Often the only cost apart from travel is a fee to the agency that has helped match the households \u2013 subscriptions can vary from the \u00a330 mark right up to a few hundred.\n\nSo this can be a cheap way to travel, especially for families who will find it easier to stay in a home than rent multiple bedrooms in a hotel.\n\nThis is rocketing in popularity and so there are many different companies set up to match swappers, including Love Home Swap and HomeExchange. Some even allow you to earn points by lending your home and spend them by borrowing one, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to be a straight swap \u2013 you can find the best property for you.\n\nOne really important thing to remember is that house-swap companies do not inspect or check the homes that are listed. Any agreement will be between you and the owners of the home you are borrowing, so there is an element of risk.\n\nThere may also be some work involved such as pet sitting or watering plants, so be ready for a genuine negotiation and ask lots of questions.\n\nAfter all, you need to be confident in the person whose home you\u2019re borrowing, so it\u2019s vital to do lots of research and get answers to any concerns before you show up at the door.\n\nYou also need to be sure your own mortgage provider or landlord and home insurer will be happy with you taking part in a holiday swap. Insurance companies are often more happy with this kind of exchange than with a commercial agreement to rent your home out.\n\nWork for your holiday\n\nIf there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch then there\u2019s definitely no such thing as a free holiday.\n\nBut there are holidays you can take for free or for a very small amount in exchange for doing some work while you\u2019re there.\n\nFor example, the International National Trusts Organisation has a list of working holidays run by members in different countries, where travellers are put up in tents and spend time each day restoring historically significant sites.\n\nAlthough these breaks aren\u2019t free, they are cheap. For example, you can spend 12 days helping restore Budos Castle, situated in Aquitaine in southwest France, for \u20ac165 (\u00a3143) plus the cost of your flights. You\u2019ll be sharing a tent with others and sharing shopping, cooking and cleaning duties, but you would also be immersed in the local culture and history.\n\nOr for \u00a3150, you can spend a week building a visitor centre near Kromeriz in the Czech Republic, including full board at a modern hostel in the town\u2019s main square.\n\nThere are other organisations offering accommodation and sightseeing in exchange for work. For example, the owners of a hostel and caf\u00e9 in Fl\u00f8rli, Norway, offer up to two weeks accommodation in exchange for 6-8 hours of work each day.\n\nWith opportunities like that it\u2019s really important to discuss in advance exactly what is expected of you, to ensure it is a direct exchange rather than exploitation.\n\nThere are also organisations linking would-be volunteers with farms in the UK and abroad. For example, WorldWide Opportunities on Organic Farms UK (WWOOF UK) links visitors with growers.\n\nTravellers spend around half their day working on the farm and learning about growing organic produce and can then spend time exploring the local area.\n\nAs with any of these working holiday opportunities, it\u2019s essential to research a placement in advance and ideally read reviews from other visitors to be sure that your expectations match the reality.\n\nVolunteering can help make a holiday or festival free but, with the right gig, it can also be an opportunity to learn something new, give something back and have fun.", "description": "Summer is here (maybe) and it\u2019s oh so easy to spend more money.
