This week, he saddles up for cycling holidays where you can beat the hills with an e-bike.\n\nBike holidays are booming \u2013 but until recently they\u2019ve been off- limits for those who aren\u2019t as fit as they\u2019d like to be (or not as fit as their travel companion).\n\nThat\u2019s changing fast and you can now rent an electric bike instead of a traditional one on a host of Europe\u2019s most scenic cycle holidays. Here are some of next year\u2019s most exciting trips\u2026\n\nHoliday Hero Neil Simpson has listed the top e-bike trips throughout Europe\n\nLap up the Lakes\n\nThe steep hills of the Lake District won\u2019t feel as daunting with the new e-bike option from cycle holiday specialist Saddle Skedaddle. On its three-night guided tour, you will be based in a country-house hotel on the banks of Derwentwater and the tour leader takes you along quiet roads (with pitstops for coffee) to the stone circle at Castlerigg and some incredible viewpoints beyond. Prices start at \u00a3315pp for bed-and-breakfast accommodation, plus two lunches and two dinners. Rent a traditional bike for \u00a355 or an e-bike for \u00a395 (www.skedaddle.com).\n\nSparkle in Cava country\n\nIf you fancy a genuinely sparkling cycle tour in Spain, try the Bikes And Bubbles route from Inn Travel. It\u2019s self-guided, which means you\u2019re given detailed directions and your luggage is taken to your next hotel for you every day.\n\nYou start amid the vineyards and bodegas west of Barcelona, stay in traditional farmhouses, and enjoy a different Cava tasting every night. There is even the option to visit a chocolate factory on the final day. Prices for four-night, half-board trips including e-bikes and return taxi transfers from Barcelona start at \u00a3854 (inntravel.co.uk).\n\nMeander along the Danube\n\nThe wide, grassy banks of the River Danube are one of the most popular cycling routes in Europe, and on the stretch from Passau to Vienna you\u2019ll pass castles, cathedrals and glorious countryside. E-bikes help with the inclines when the path occasionally winds away from the river, which you cross by ferry on day two.\n\nThe self-guided Danube Cycle Path tour takes in Enns, the oldest town in Austria, and follows the river alongside monasteries and mountains and through orchards and vineyards.\n\nA seven-night B&B trip starts from \u00a3579pp with a traditional bike and from \u00a3678 with an e-bike (freewheelholidays.co.uk).\n\nSicily\u2019s hottest attraction\n\nNew for 2020 is a dreamy Sicilian trip aimed at those who love Italian food, wine and culture. The Syracuse to Mount Etna guided tour takes in Roman ruins, baroque architecture, Byzantine mosaics and stops for pastries filled with almonds, walnuts, pistachios, honey and oranges. You can swim in rocky coves and ride around the still-active volcano. A seven-night tour starts at \u00a31,299pp, including flights, bikes and B&B accommodation. E-bikes are an extra \u00a3155 (explore.co.uk).\n\nCoast around chateaux\n\nEasy riding: A family cycles along a riverside route next to one of the Loire Valley\u2019s spectacular castles\n\nThe flat, largely car-free cycle routes round the Loire Valley will feel even easier in 2020 when Cycling for Softies introduces an e-bike version of its classic Chateaux Of The Loire self-guided tour.\n\nYou\u2019ll start by coasting through vineyards, stopping for house, garden and wine-cellar tours and the chance to sample some of the area\u2019s famous wines.\n\nThe four-night half-board tours, where you get GPS apps to supplement your maps, start at \u00a3995, including e-bikes (cycling-for-softies.co.uk).", "description": "Holiday Hero Neil Simpson has listed the top e-bike trips throughout Europe.
