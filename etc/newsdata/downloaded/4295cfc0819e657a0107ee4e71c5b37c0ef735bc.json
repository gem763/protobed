The color that Google leans heavily towards with each Material Design revamp is white.\n\nImage: Google\n\nMore on Google, G Suite, and Material Design", "description": "Google's office productivity apps on Android have been given the Material Design treatment.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/08/6ef00342-bf4a-42ae-9765-fa4093fa1bd8/thumbnail/770x578/25121f78dfdfcda592fa9eb2c4d684db/manphonelaptopistock-1159430222.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
