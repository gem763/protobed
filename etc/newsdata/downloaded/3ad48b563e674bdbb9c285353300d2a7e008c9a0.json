In April, inside the yellow-brick industrial building, the classical vocalist Brenda Wimberly and the keyboardist Justin Dillard give a special performance for a group that includes local friends, curators and educators, as well as Cave\u2019s high school art teacher, Lois Mikrut, who flew in from North Carolina for the event. Outside, stretching across the windows along Milwaukee Avenue, is a 70-foot-long mosaic made of 7,000 circular name tags with a mix of red and white backgrounds, each of them personalized by local schoolchildren and community members. They spell out the message \u201cLove Thy Neighbor.\u201d\n\nThe simple declaration of togetherness and shared purpose is a mission statement for the space, a creative incubator as well as Cave\u2019s home and studio, which he shares with his partner, Bob Faust, and his older brother Jack. It\u2019s also a raison d\u2019\u00eatre for Cave, an uncategorizable talent who has never fit the mold of the artist in his studio. Best known for his Soundsuits \u2014 many of which are ornate, full-body costumes designed to rattle and resonate with the movement of the wearer \u2014 his work, which combines sculpture, fashion and performance, connects the anxieties and divisions of our time to the intimacies of the body.\n\n[Sign up here for the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting now.]\n\nExhibited in galleries or worn by dancers, the suits \u2014 fanciful assemblages that include bright pelts of dyed hair, twigs, sequins, repurposed sweaters, crocheted doilies, gramophones or even stuffed sock-monkey dolls, their eerie grins covering an entire supersize garment \u2014 are compulsively, unsettlingly decorative. Some are amusingly creature-like; others are lovely in an almost ecclesiastical way, bedecked with shimmering headpieces embellished with beads and porcelain birds and other discarded tchotchkes he picks up at flea markets. Even at the level of medium, Cave operates against entrenched hierarchies, elevating glittery consumer detritus and traditional handicrafts like beadwork or sewing to enchanting heights.\n\nThe artist recalls the first time he saw Barkley L. Hendricks\u2019s painting \u201cSteve\u201d (1976). By Scott J. Ross\n\nIn invigorating performances that often involve collaborations with local musicians and choreographers, the Soundsuits can seem almost shaman-esque, a contemporary spin on kukeri, ancient European folkloric creatures said to chase away evil spirits. They recall as well something out of Maurice Sendak, ungainly wild things cutting loose on the dance floor in a gleeful, liberating rumpus. The surprising movements of the Soundsuits, which change depending on the materials used to make them, tend to guide Cave\u2019s performances and not the other way around. There is something ritual-like and purifying about all the whirling hair and percussive music; the process of dressing the dancers in their 40-pound suits resembles preparing samurai for battle. After each performance, the suits made of synthetic hair require tender grooming, like pets. Cave\u2019s New York gallerist, Jack Shainman, recalls the time he assisted in the elaborate process of brushing them out \u2014 \u201cI was starting to bug out, because there were 20 or 30 of them\u201d \u2014 only to have Cave take over and do it all himself. Much beloved and much imitated (as I write this, an Xfinity ad is airing in which a colorful, furry-suited creature is buoyantly leaping about), they can be found in permanent museum collections across America.\n\nTheir origins are less intellectual than emotional, as Cave tells it, and they\u2019re both playful and deadly serious. He initially conceived of them as a kind of race-, class- and gender-obscuring armature, one that\u2019s both insulating and isolating, an articulation of his profound sense of vulnerability as a black man. Using costume to unsettle and dispel assumptions about identity is part of a long tradition of drag, from Elizabethan drama to Stonewall and beyond; at the same time, the suits are the perfect expression of W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019s idea of double consciousness, the psychological adjustments black Americans make in order to survive within a white racist society, a vigilant, anticipatory awareness of the perceptions of others. It\u2019s no coincidence that Cave made the first Soundsuit in 1992, after the beating of Rodney King by the Los Angeles Police Department in 1991, a still-vivid racial touchstone in American history; almost three decades later, the suits are no less timely. \u201cIt was an almost inflammatory response,\u201d he remembers, looking shaken as he recalls watching King\u2019s beating on television 28 years ago. \u201cI felt like my identity and who I was as a human being was up for question. I felt like that could have been me. Once that incident occurred, I was existing very differently in the world. So many things were going through my head: How do I exist in a place that sees me as a threat?\u201d\n\nCave had begun teaching at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, with its predominately white faculty, two years before, and in the aftermath of the incident, followed by the acquittal of the officers responsible, he felt his isolation painfully. \u201cI really felt there was no one there I could talk to. None of my colleagues addressed it. I just felt like, \u2018I\u2019m struggling with this, this is affecting my people.\u2019 I would think that someone would be empathetic to that and say, \u2018How are you doing?\u2019 I held it all in internally. And that\u2019s when I found myself sitting in the park,\u201d he says. In Grant Park, around the corner from his classroom, he started gathering twigs \u2014 \u201csomething that was discarded, dismissed, viewed as less. And it became the catalyst for the first Soundsuit.\u201d\n\nFor many years after he began making his signature work, Cave deliberately avoided the spotlight, shying away from an adoring public: \u201cI knew I had the ability, but I wasn\u2019t ready, or I didn\u2019t want to leave my friends behind. I think this grounded me, and made me an artist with a conscience. Then, one day, something said, \u2018Now or never,\u2019 and I had to step into the light.\u201d Initially, he wasn\u2019t prepared for the success of the Soundsuits. For much of the \u201990s, \u201cI literally shoved all of them into the closet because I wasn\u2019t ready for the intensity of that attention,\u201d Cave says. He began exhibiting the Soundsuits at his first solo shows, mostly in galleries across the Midwest; he\u2019s since made more than 500 of them. They\u2019ve grown alongside Cave\u2019s practice, evolving from a form of protective shell to an outsize, exuberant expression of confidence that pushes the boundaries of visibility. They demand to be seen.\n\nFrom left: a 2012 Soundsuit made from buttons, wire, bugle beads, wood and upholstery; a 2013 Soundsuit made from mixed media including a vintage bunny, safety-pin craft baskets, hot pads, fabric and metal; a 2009 Soundsuit made from human hair; a 2012 Soundsuit made from mixed media including sock monkeys, sweaters and pipe cleaners.

Photos by James Prinz Photography\n\nFollowing the phenomenal success of the Soundsuits, Cave\u2019s focus has expanded to the culture that produced them, with shows that more directly implicate viewers and demand civic engagement around issues like gun violence and racial inequality. But increasingly, the art that interests Cave is the art he inspires others to make. With a Dalloway-like genius for bringing people from different walks of life to the table in experiences of shared good will, Cave sees himself as a messenger first and an artist second, which might sound more than a touch pretentious if it weren\u2019t already so clear that these roles have, for some time, been intertwined. In 2015, he trained youth from an L.G.B.T.Q. shelter in Detroit to dance in a Soundsuit performance. The same year, during a six-month residency in Shreveport, La., he coordinated a series of bead-a-thon projects at six social-service agencies, one dedicated to helping people with H.I.V. and AIDS, and enlisted dozens of local artists into creating a vast multimedia production in March of 2016, \u201cAs Is.\u201d In June 2018, he transformed New York\u2019s Park Avenue Armory, a former drill hall converted into an enormous performance venue, into a Studio 54-esque disco experience with his piece \u2014 part revival, part dance show, part avant-garde ballet \u2014 called \u201cThe Let Go,\u201d inviting attendees to engage in an unabashedly ecstatic free dance together: a call to arms and catharsis in one. Last summer, with the help of the nonprofit Now & There, a public art curator, he enlisted community groups in Boston\u2019s Dorchester neighborhood to collaborate on a vast collage that will be printed on material and wrapped around one of the area\u2019s unoccupied buildings; in September, also in collaboration with Now & There, he led a parade that included local performers from the South End to Upham\u2019s Corner with \u201cAugment,\u201d a puffy riot of deconstructed inflatable lawn ornaments \u2014 the Easter bunny, Uncle Sam, Santa\u2019s reindeer \u2014 all twisted up in a colossal Frankenstein bouquet of childhood memories. Cave understands that the lost art of creating community, of joining forces to accomplish a task at hand, whether it\u2019s beading a curtain or mending the tattered social fabric, depends upon igniting a kind of dreaming, a gameness, a childlike ability to imagine ideas into being. But it also involves recognizing the disparate histories that divide and bind us. The strength of any group depends on an awareness of its individuals.\n\nFACILITY IS THE next iteration of that larger mission, and Cave and Faust, a graphic designer and artist, spent years looking for the right space. Creating it required a great deal of diplomacy and determination, as well as an agreeable alderman to assist with the zoning changes and permits. And while it evokes Warhol\u2019s Factory in name, in intent, the approximately 20,000-square-foot former mason\u2019s workshop has a very different cast.\n\n\u201cFacilitating, you know, projects. Energies. Individuals. Dreams. Every day, I wake up, he wakes up, and we\u2019re like, \u2018O.K. How can we be of service in a time of need?\u2019\u201d says Cave, who gave me a tour in the fall of 2018, not long after he and Faust settled into the space. Dressed entirely in black \u2014 leather pants and a sweater, and sneakers with metallic accents \u2014 the 60-year-old artist has a dancer\u2019s bearing (he trained for several summers in the early \u201980s at a program in Kansas City run by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater) and an aura of kindness and irrepressible positivity. One wants to have what he\u2019s having. \u201cGirl, you can wear anything,\u201d he reassures me when I fret about the green ruched dress I\u2019m wearing, which under his discerning gaze suddenly strikes me as distinctly caterpillarlike. It comes as no surprise that Cave\u2019s favorite adjective is \u201cfabulous.\u201d\n\nVintage bird figurines in the artist\u2019s studio. Ren\u00e9e Cox\n\nIn contrast to his maximalist art practice, his fashion tastes have grown more austere, as of late, and include vintage suits and monochrome classics from Maison Margiela, Rick Owens and Helmut Lang. \u201cI have a fabulous sneaker collection,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you know, the reason why is because those floors at the school are so hard,\u201d he says, referring to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he is now a professor of Fashion, Body and Garment. (I also teach at the school, in a different department.) \u201cI can\u2019t wear a hard shoe, I have to wear a sneaker,\u201d he says. Faust teases him: \u201cI love how you\u2019ve just justified having that many sneakers.\u201d\n\nCave met Faust, who runs his own business from Facility, in addition to supporting the artist as his special projects director, when he happened to stop by a sample sale of Cave\u2019s clothing designs in the early 2000s. The Soundsuits are, for all intents and purposes, a kind of clothing, so fashion has been a natural part of Cave\u2019s artistic practice since the beginning \u2014 he studied fiber arts as an undergraduate at the Kansas City Art Institute, where he first learned to sew. In 1996, he started a namesake fashion line for men and women that lasted a decade. If the Soundsuits resist categorization as something to wear in everyday life, they arrive at their unclassifiable beauty by taking the basic elements of clothing design \u2014 stitching, sewing, understanding how a certain material falls or looks with another kind of material \u2014 and exaggerating them into the realm of atmospheric psychedelia. That he teaches in the fashion department at an art school further underscores the thin line Cave has always walked between clothing and sculpture, all of it preoccupied in some way with the human body, its form and potential energy. His own clothing designs are slightly \u2014 only slightly \u2014 more practical variations on the Soundsuits: loud embroidered sweaters, crocheted shirts with sparkly jewelry. \u201cHe came in and was like, \u2018These clothes are so out there, I can\u2019t wear any of this,\u2019\u201d Cave recalls, laughing. (Faust politely bought a sweater and still wears it today.) At the time, the artist was about to publish his first book and asked Faust to design it; the collaboration was a success, and Faust has subsequently designed all of Cave\u2019s publications. About eight years ago, the nature of the relationship changed. \u201cBefore that, I was single for 10 years. I was always traveling, and who is going to handle all of that?\u201d Cave says. \u201cBut Bob already knew who I was, and that makes all the difference. Being with someone who is a visionary in his own right and using this platform as a place of consciousness \u2014 it\u2019s very important to me.\u201d\n\nIn this clip from Cave\u2019s \u201cHere,\u201d the artist\u2019s Soundsuits are captured in Detroit. \u00a9 Nick Cave. Courtesy of The Artist And Jack Shainman Gallery, New York.\n\nUpstairs is the couple\u2019s living space and selections from Cave\u2019s personal art collection: a Kehinde Wiley here, a Kerry James Marshall there. (A lesson from Cave: Buy work from your friends before they become famous.) Cave and Faust opted to leave the floors and walls scarred, bearing the traces of its former use as an industrial building. In a small, sunny room off the kitchen, one corner of the ceiling is left open to accommodate an abandoned wasp\u2019s nest, a subtle, scrolled masterpiece of found architecture. Faust\u2019s teenage daughter also has a bedroom, and Jack, an artist with a design bent, has an adjacent apartment.\n\nDownstairs, in the cavernous work space big enough to host a fashion show, musical or dance performance, are Cave\u2019s and Faust\u2019s studios. Some of Cave\u2019s assistants \u2014 he has six of them, Faust has one \u2014 are applying beads on a vast, multistory tapestry, a project for Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport called \u201cPalimpsest.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll all be gathered and bustled, so there\u2019s layers and layers of color. Kind of like an old billboard that, over time, weathers, and layers come off and you see the history,\u201d Cave explains. A front gallery is a flexible space where video art visible from the street could be projected \u2014 a nod to Cave\u2019s first job out of art school, designing window displays for Macy\u2019s \u2014 or young artists could be invited to display work around a shared theme. Facility has already established an art competition and prizes for Chicago Public School students and funded a special award for graduate fashion students at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. \u201cThere are lots of creative people that do amazing things but just have never had a break,\u201d Cave says. \u201cAnd so to be able to host them in some way, these are the sort of things that are important to us, so we thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d\n\nAWKWARD PERSONAL disclosures. Long evaluative silences. Talk of \u201ccoming to form.\u201d Art-school crits \u2014 sessions in which a professor reviews his students\u2019 work \u2014 are all pretty similar, but Cave\u2019s are famous both for their perspicacity and warmth. For all his multi-hyphenates, \u201cteacher\u201d may be the role that best sums up his totality of being. \u201cWhen someone believes in your work, it changes how you see your future,\u201d he says when we meet in the vast, light-filled studios in downtown Chicago, where the graduate fashion students are working.\n\nIt\u2019s the second-to-last crit of the year for Cave\u2019s first-year students in the two-year M.F.A. program, and the pressure is on to develop their own distinct visual language before they begin their thesis projects in the fall. One woman from Russia has made a set of dresses from delicate organic 3-D-printed shapes \u2014 mushrooms, flowers \u2014 sewing them together and arranging them on a mannequin; they resemble exquisite body cages. Cave suggests that she should work in muslin on a flat surface rather than directly on the mannequin in order to make the silhouette \u201cless uptight.\u201d\n\nCave\u2019s \u201cUntitled\u201d (2018), which features a carved head and an American flag made of used shotgun shells.

Photo by James Prinz Photography\n\nNext up is a student from China, who directs our attention to an anchor-shaped object suspended from the ceiling. It is made of small blue squares of fabric she\u2019s dipped in batter and deep-fried to stiffen. She plays Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s \u201cThe Anchor Song\u201d for us on her iPhone and explains that the textile sculpture is an expression of homesickness, longing and the mourning of a long relationship. We stare up at it silently. There\u2019s a faint whiff of grease. After some back and forth with the student, Cave delivers his verdict: \u201cYour tent is big, but you need to get on your boxing gloves and get in there,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be completely, 100 percent in it, and not let your will dictate. Bring all the parts together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was pretty raw,\u201d says Cave, once we are back in his office, noting that, when given a push, the student with the anchor astonishes everyone with what she can do. He clearly adores all of his charges, and sees teaching as a way of passing on his own teachers\u2019 lessons: a way of liberating the creative subconscious within the technical rigors of design. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at what\u2019s there \u2014 fabric, shape and form \u2014 and asking, \u2018How are you coming to pattern, how are you coming to design?\u2019 And some have just opened up for the first time, and the moment you open up, there are bigger questions, there\u2019s a lot more responsibility, there\u2019s so much more to grapple with.\u201d\n\nA second-year student, Sean Gu, stops by to say hello. He\u2019s just returned from China with a suitcase full of completed samples he wants to show Cave. The garments, jackets and vests, have zips and seat-belt-like buckles and artfully drooping corners that were inspired by Chinese political slogans. Cave and I take turns trying them on: One piece, a vest made of reflective polyurethane with multiple armholes and zippers, is our favorite. (Cave wore it best, of course.) The look on his face is one of pure delight in the cool, fabulous thing his student has made.\n\nWhere, one might ask, did Cave\u2019s seemingly boundless reservoirs of optimism and joy and productive energy come from? The short answer is Missouri, where Cave, born in Fulton, in the central part of the state, and raised in nearby Columbia, was the third of seven brothers. His mother, Sharron Kelly, worked in medical administration (Cave\u2019s parents divorced when he was young), and his maternal grandparents lived nearby on a farm filled with animals. \u201cNow that I look back, it was really so amazing for my brothers and myself to be in the presence of all of that unconditional love,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were rambunctious, and of course you fight with your brothers, but we always made up through hugging or kissing. It was just part of the infrastructure.\u201d Personal space was limited but respected, a chart of chores was maintained, and creative projects were always afoot (his aunts are seamstresses; his grandmother was a quilter). Hand-me-downs were individually customized by each new wearer. \u201cI had to find ways of finding my identity through deconstructing,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo, if I didn\u2019t want to be in my brother\u2019s jacket, I\u2019d take off the sleeves and replace it with plaid material. I was already in that process of cutting and putting things back together and finding a new vocabulary through dress.\u201d\n\nA detail of Cave\u2019s 2019 \u201cAugment\u201d installation, made from inflatable lawn ornaments. Ren\u00e9e Cox\n\nThe artist tells an illuminating story about his mother, who managed the household on one income and would still often find ways to send food to a struggling family in the neighborhood. Once, during a particularly tight month, she came home from work to realize that there was no food left in the house except dried corn. And so she made a party of it, showing her sons a movie on television and popping the corn. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to shift how we experience something,\u201d says Cave, recalling how she would entertain them simply by putting a sock on her hand and changing her voice to create a character. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, but it\u2019s everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re just totally captivated. It\u2019s these moments of fantasy and belief that\u2019s also informed how I go about my work.\u201d\n\nFashion\u2019s transformative power was also something he understood young, beginning with watching his older female relatives attend church in their fancy hats. In high school, Cave and Jack, who is two years older, experimented with platform shoes and two-tone flared pants. High fashion came to town, literally, via the Ebony Fashion Fair, a traveling show launched and produced between 1958 and 2009 by Eunice W. Johnson, the co-founder of Johnson Publishing Company, which published Ebony and Jet magazines, both cultural bibles for black America. \u201cEbony magazine was really the first place we saw people of color with style and power and money and vision, and that fashion show would travel to all of these small towns,\u201d he reminisces. \u201cHoney, black runway back in the day was a spectacle. It\u2019s not just walking down the runway. It was almost like theater. And I\u2019m this young boy just eating it up and feeling like I\u2019m just in a dream, because it\u2019s all fabulous and I just admire beauty to that extreme. I was just completely consumed by that.\u201d His high school teachers encouraged him to apply to the Kansas City Art Institute, where he and Jack would stage fashion shows, which felt more like performance pieces thanks to Cave\u2019s increasingly outr\u00e9 clothing designs. \u201cI just had what I needed to have in order to be the person I need to be,\u201d Cave says.\n\nAlso harrowingly formative to Cave\u2019s outlook was the AIDS crisis, which was at its deadly height while he was in graduate school at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan in the late \u201980s. He became painfully aware of the function of denial in our culture, and the extent of people\u2019s unwillingness to see. \u201cWatching my friends die played a big part in my perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cIn those moments, you have a choice to be in denial with them or to be present, to be the one to say, \u2018This is happening.\u2019 You have to make a decision to go through that process with them, to pick up their parents at the airport, to clean to get their apartments ready for their parents to stay. And then you have to say goodbye, and then they\u2019re gone, and you\u2019re packing up their belongings to send to their families. And then you\u2019re just left there in an empty apartment, not knowing what to feel.\u201d In a single year, he lost five friends and confronted his own mortality waiting for his test results. \u201cJust \u2014 choosing not to be in denial in any circumstance,\u201d he says.\n\nTHE VULNERABILITY OF the black body in a historically white context is a subject generations of African-American artists have contended with, perhaps most iconically in Glenn Ligon\u2019s 1990 untitled etching, in which the phrase \u201cI feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background,\u201d adapted from Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s 1928 essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d is printed over and over again in black stencil on a white canvas, the words blurring as they travel the length of the canvas. In her book \u201cCitizen: An American Lyric\u201d (2014), the poet Claudia Rankine, writing about Serena Williams, puts it this way: \u201cThe body has a memory. The physical carriage hauls more than its weight. The body is the threshold across which each objectionable call passes into consciousness \u2014 all the unintimidated, unblinking and unflappable resilience does not erase the moments lived through, even as we are eternally stupid or everlastingly optimistic, so ready to be inside, among, a part of the games.\u201d\n\nThe individual body has a memory, and so do collective bodies, retaining a longer and longer list of names \u2014 Eric Garner on Staten Island, Michael Brown in Missouri, Trayvon Martin in Florida and so many more innocent black people who have suffered violence and death at the hands of police \u2014 within it. But that day in 1992, hurrying back to his studio with a cart full of twigs and setting out to build a sculpture from them, Cave had no idea that the result would be a garment. \u201cAt first, it didn\u2019t occur to me that I could wear it; I wasn\u2019t thinking about it.\u201d When he finally did put it on and moved around, it made a sound. \u201cAnd that was the beginning,\u201d he says. \u201cThe sound was a way of alarming others to my presence. The suit became a suit of armor where I hid my identity. It was something \u2018other.\u2019 It was an answer to all of these things I had been thinking about: What do I do to protect my spirit in spite of all that\u2019s happening around me?\u201d Throughout the Soundsuits\u2019 countless iterations, Cave has tinkered with their proportions, thinking about the shapes of power, constructing forms that recall a pope\u2019s miter or the head of a missile. Some of them are 10 feet tall.\n\nBut no matter their variations, these Soundsuit designs have always felt personal and unique, as if only Cave himself could have invented them. And yet he is also aware of how the pain he is addressing in these works is also written into our culture: There is a long lineage of casual cruelty that has shaped Cave\u2019s art. His 2014 installation at Jack Shainman Gallery, \u201cMade by Whites for Whites,\u201d was inspired by an undated ceramic container Cave found in a flea market that, when pulled off the shelf, revealed itself to be the cartoonishly painted disembodied head of a black man. \u201cSpittoon,\u201d read the label. Renting a cargo bay, Cave toured the country in search of the most racially charged memorabilia he could find. The centerpiece of the show, \u201cSacrifice,\u201d features a bronze cast of Cave\u2019s own hands and arms, holding another severed head, this one part of an old whack-a-mole type carnival game \u2014 simultaneously lending compassion to the object while implicating its beholder. Look, Cave is saying. If we\u2019re ever going to move past this hatred, we have to acknowledge what it is that produced it.\n\nA collection of racially charged salt and pepper shakers that Cave found in a flea market and keeps in his studio. Ren\u00e9e Cox\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that Nick doesn\u2019t have a dark side,\u201d Denise Markonish, the senior curator and managing director of exhibitions at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, Mass., tells me. Markonish approached Cave in 2013 about planning an exhibition for the museum\u2019s largest gallery. \u201cHe wants to seduce you and punch you in the gut.\u201d The result, the artist\u2019s most ambitious seduction to date, was his 2016 show, \u201cUntil,\u201d a twist on the legal principle of innocence until guilt is proven. For it, Cave transformed the football-field-size room into a sinister wonderland, featuring a vast crystal cloudscape suspended 18 feet into the air made up of miles of crystals, thousands of ceramic birds, 13 gilded pigs and a fiberglass crocodile covered in large marbles. Accessible by ladder, the top of the cloud was studded with cast-iron lawn jockeys, all of them holding dream catchers. It\u2019s an apt and deeply unsettling vision of today\u2019s America, land of injustice and consumer plenty, distracted from yet haunted by all of the things it would prefer not to see.\n\nWhile they were sourcing the materials for the show, Markonish tells me, they realized how expensive crystals are, and one of the curators, Alexandra Foradas, called Cave to ask if some of them could be acrylic. \u201cHe said, \u2018Oh, absolutely, 75 percent can be acrylic but the remaining 50 percent should be glass.\u2019 She said, \u2018Nick, that\u2019s 125 percent,\u2019 and without pausing he said, \u2018Exactly.\u2019\u201d After the show, Markonish asked Cave and Faust to create a graphic expression of the exhibition, which resulted in a tattoo on the inside of her index finger that reads \u201c125%.\u201d \u201cOf course, at that point, it wasn\u2019t about his use of material,\u201d she says, \u201cbut about his dedication and generosity. It was his idea to open up his exhibition to people from the community, to performers or for discussions about the difficult things he wants to talk about in his work.\u201d\n\nOne of those themes is the gun violence that has ravaged many black communities; Chicago, Cave\u2019s home of three decades, had more shooting victims (2,948) in 2018 than Los Angeles (1,008) and New York (897) combined, largely concentrated in a handful of neighborhoods on the South and West Sides. (Cave had hoped to open Facility on Chicago\u2019s racially diverse West Side, only to run into intransigent zoning laws; he wants to find a permanent home there for \u201cUntil\u201d and has art projects planned with the area\u2019s high schools.) Cave\u2019s most recent gallery show, \u201cIf a Tree Falls,\u201d which featured sculptural installations and opened at Jack Shainman Gallery in fall 2018, strikes a more somber, elegiac note than his previous work, juxtaposing body parts in bronze monochrome, including casts of his own arms emerging from the gallery walls, holding delicate flower bouquets, which suggest a sense of renewal, of hope and metamorphosis. He\u2019s now working on a new series of bronze sculptures, which include casts of his own hands, topped with cast tree branches, birds and flowers, the first of which is meant to debut at Miami\u2019s Art Basel in December. The sculptures will be on a much bigger scale \u2014 a human form made larger than life with embellishment, not unlike the Soundsuits in approach but with a new sense of gravity and monumentality (they are intended to be shown outdoors). The man famous for bringing a light touch to the heaviest of themes is, finally, stripping away the merry trappings and embracing the sheer weight of now.\n\n\u201cArm Peace,\u201d part of a series of sculptures created for Cave\u2019s 2018 solo show, \u201cIf a Tree Falls,\u201d at Jack Shainman Gallery. Ren\u00e9e Cox A detail of \u201cTondo\u201d (2019). Ren\u00e9e Cox\n\nWhen I ask Cave how he feels about the critical reception of his work \u2014 he is one of that select group of artists, like Jeff Koons or David Hockney, who is celebrated by both high art and popular culture \u2014 he tells me that he stopped reading his shows\u2019 reviews, but not because he\u2019s afraid of being misunderstood or underappreciated; instead, he seems to be objecting to a kind of critical passivity. \u201cWhat I find peculiar is that no one really wants to get in there and talk about what\u2019s behind it all,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t put it out there. And I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nI push him to clarify: \u201cDo you mean that a white reviewer of your show might explain that the work provides commentary on race and violence and history but won\u2019t extend that thinking any further, to his or her own cultural inheritance and privilege?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may provide the context, but it doesn\u2019t go further. They\u2019re not providing any point of view or perspective, or sense of what they\u2019re receiving from this engagement. I just think it\u2019s how we exist in society,\u201d he replies.\n\nOne of the four covers of T\u2019s 2019 Greats issue Ren\u00e9e Cox\n\nIs art alone enough to shake us from our complacency? Two decades into a new millennium, these questions have fresh urgency: By turning away from stricken neighborhoods and underfunded schools, we\u2019ve perpetuated the conditions of inequality and violence, effectively devaluing our own people. We\u2019ve dimmed the very kind of 20th-century American dreaming that led so many of us, including Cave, to a life filled with possibility. Whether or not this can be reversed depends on our being able to look without judgment and walk without blinders, he believes. It means reassessing our own roles in the public theater. It means choosing not to be in denial or giving in to despair. It means seeing beyond the self to something greater.\n\n\u201cI just want everything to be fabulous,\u201d he tells me, as we part ways for the afternoon. \u201cI want it to be beautiful, even when the subject is hard. Honey, the question is, how do you want to exist in the world, and how are you going to do the work?\u201d", "description": "Through more than 40 intense and idiosyncratic roles \u2014 often in films a world away from typical Hollywood fare \u2014 the actress reveals a woman in complete command.", "authors": ["Susan Dominus", "Megan O Grady", "Nikil Saval", "Alice Gregory"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/t-magazine/14tmag-weisz-slide-GQTK-copy/14tmag-weisz-slide-GQTK-copy-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
