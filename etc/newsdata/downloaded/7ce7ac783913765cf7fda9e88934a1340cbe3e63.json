I am very proud of her for this as it was a huge thing for her to do, as she did love having such long hair.\n\n\"Darlene really wants to spread the word of donating hair in the hope that other children would be willing to do the same.\"", "description": "Darlene, from Newquay, finally decided to take the plunge after deciding she wanted to help poorly children", "authors": ["Mike Smallcombe", "Image", "Cornwalllive.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728593.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_261019Slug_11116JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
