Eight players had a hand in at least one.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know we had 10 sacks until we got into the locker room,\u201d linebacker Jesse Luketa said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised, though. We call them the \u2018Wild Dogs\u2019 for a reason. We let them loose and it was time to hunt. I\u2019m excited for them. A couple weeks ago there was talk about how our front four weren\u2019t as productive as what we wanted, and today they took that to heart and went out and executed.\u201d\n\nPurdue had minus-19 rushing yards, the fewest against Penn State since 1978 and fifth-fewest since 1947.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s nine sacks were its most since at least 1995, with linebackers Chris Orr and Jack Sanborn recording two apiece. The Badgers have 21 sacks, two more than last season\u2019s total.\n\nMichigan\u2019s eight sacks came against an Iowa team that had allowed just six in its first four games. Kwity Paye led the Wolverines with 2.5.\n\nOhio State is the national team leader in sacks. The Buckeyes had four against Michigan State and have 28 for the season.\n\nTHE 200 CLUB\n\nMinnesota\u2019s Rodney Smith had the week\u2019s top rushing performance, running 24 times for 211 yards against Illinois. Kenny Gainwell of Memphis had the next-best effort with 209 yards on 14 carries against Louisiana-Monroe. Those were the ninth and 10th 200-yard performances of the season.\n\nA FORCE ON FOURTH\n\nSMU converted a nation-high six of seven fourth downs in its three-overtime win over Tulsa. The Mustangs converted all four in the fourth quarter, including two on the final scoring drive of regulation, and they picked up 15 yards on a fourth-and-3 on their first overtime possession.\n\nINTERCEPTIONS GALORE\n\nSan Diego State\u2019s Luq Barcoo intercepted three straight passes in the second half against Colorado State, making him the first Football Bowl Subdivision player since at least 2012 to pick off passes on three consecutive plays.\n\nBarcoo\u2019s three interceptions are the most in a game this season. He has four for the year.\n\nALL THE WAY\n\nFlorida International\u2019s Maurice Alexander had the nation\u2019s longest punt return with his 90-yard runback for a touchdown against Massachusetts. His return was the second-longest in program history behind T.Y. Hilton\u2019s 97-yarder in 2011.\n\nNATIONAL LEADERS\n\nWashington State\u2019s Anthony Gordon is the only quarterback passing for more than 400 yards per game. He\u2019s averaging 429, completing 72 percent with 22 touchdowns and six interceptions. He\u2019s ahead of LSU\u2019s Joe Burrow, who\u2019s averaging 373 and completing a nation-best 78.4 percent with 22 TDs and three interceptions.\n\nOklahoma State\u2019s Chuba Hubbard, the first player over 1,000 yards this season, is the top rusher at 182 yards per game. Jonathan Taylor of Wisconsin is second at 149.\n\nArkansas State\u2019s Omar Bayless is first in receiving, averaging 141 yards. He already has set a career high with 44 receptions in six games, and he\u2019s caught a nation-high 10 TD passes.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Big Ten defenses turned in three of the season's top five sack totals over the weekend, with Penn State leading the way with 10 against Purdue.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/purdue_penn_st_football_03742_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
