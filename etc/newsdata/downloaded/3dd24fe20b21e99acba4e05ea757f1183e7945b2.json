Photo: Courtesy of the retailers\n\nUnderwear: You wear it every day, so you better get it right (much like jeans and white tees). Whether you prefer bikinis, high-waisted briefs, or thongs, the ideal pair of underwear is one that takes you through the day without requiring much thought. To find the best kinds of women\u2019s underwear, we reached out to 26 stylish businesswomen, models, designers, and musicians to get their favorites. And to ensure we left no pairs behind, we also culled our archives for underwear recommended by other interesting people (Amber Rose and Barbara Corcoran, to name two). Read on for all of their picks, which include practical underwear that will get you through the workday without a wedgie, pairs that will be invisible under even the slinkiest dresses, and a few styles that you\u2019ll probably want to show off.\n\nBest overall women\u2019s underwear\n\nThree women we talked to named underwear from newly launched brand The KiT as their current favorite. Created by stylists Jamie Mizrahi and Simone Harouche \u2014 who, as the Cut notes, have plenty of experience working with undergarments that fit seamlessly beneath outfits \u2014 the brand offers bras, bodysuits, pasties, bandage tape, and eight kinds of underwear that come in neutral shades. Maisonette co-founder Sylvana Ward Durrett is one fan of the brand. \u201cFrom the seamless briefs to the adhesive thongs, each style is like true magic where I don\u2019t have to worry about underwear lines,\u201d she says. \u201cI also love the high-waisted styles that smooth everything out and often opt for these when I\u2019m wearing a slim-fitting dress or skirt.\u201d On the whole, Durrett says that underwear from The KiT is lightweight and has a barely-there feeling. Morgan Hutchinson, founder of clothing line BURU, says that she\u2019s become a \u201cfast fan\u201d of the brand since its launch as well. She particularly likes The KiT\u2019s seamless thongs. \u201cThe high-rise is awesome for mum-tum,\u201d she says. And, as the Cut reports, the fact that the underwear is designed by stylists who have to pay attention to what shows and doesn\u2019t show under a garment is a big plus. Nell Diamond, founder of Hill House Home, agrees, saying she loves that The KiT was created by stylists because it means she worries less about whether her underwear will show under a dress or if her bra is the wrong shape. \u201cThe KiT\u2019s styles have really simplified things for me,\u201d Diamond says. \u201cPlus, their lightest shade is pale enough even for a ghost like me (my nickname in middle school was Casper.\u201d)\n\nSeveral of the women we spoke to named Commando as a go-to underwear brand, whether it be for briefs, bikinis, or thongs. Stylist Jasmine Caccamo says that the brand\u2019s stretch-cotton bikini briefs are seamless and \u201ccreate a super-flawless (a.k.a. wedgie-free) fit\u201d whether she\u2019s wearing them under leggings or a silk cami dress. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about comfort and functionality,\u201d Caccamo says. \u201cNot only do I love Commando-brand underwear for myself, but for my celebrity clients as well \u2026 I\u2019m obsessed.\u201d Costume designer and Strategist contributor Alison Freer prefers the brand\u2019s boy shorts, which she says \u201care both elastic and trim-free \u2014 meaning they won\u2019t dig in, bunch up, or cause lumpy, unflattering bulges under a flattering pair of pants.\u201d The underwear never shifts, slides, twists, or reveals itself once you start moving and sweating, according to Freer, and best of all, the wide sides keep it securely in place on your body, preventing a wedgie. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever wondered what the stars on the red carpet were wearing underneath those sheer, unforgiving gowns, the answer is almost certainly a pair of Commandos,\u201d Freer says. If a thong is more your style, two of the women we talked to recommended the brand\u2019s mid- and low-rise options. \u201cOkay, so here\u2019s the thing about these thongs,\u201d says Cupcakes and Cashmere founder Emily Schuman of the mid-rise cut. \u201cThere is nothing remotely sexy about them \u2014 they\u2019re devoid of lace, have super-thick sides, but they lie completely flat against my skin and don\u2019t show under even the tightest, lightest pieces.\u201d The absence of seams and tags \u201cmakes it feel like you\u2019ve gone commando (hence the name),\u201d says Schuman. \u201cBest of both worlds!\u201d Stylist Tiffany Gifford is a Commando thong fan, as well, though she prefers the low-rise over the mid-rise. \u201cMy favorite underwear are Commando\u2019s thongs,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cThey are seamless, and come in great colors and an array of sizes. The best underwear you forget are even there, and that\u2019s what these do.\u201d\n\nHanky Panky Low Rise Cotton Thong 3 Pack $60 at Shopbop Buy\n\nIf you prefer something lacy, Hanky Panky is a classic underwear brand that remains a favorite of several of the women we talked to. When we asked Barbara Corcoran, the founder of Corcoran Group, about her favorite things, Hanky Panky\u2019s Signature Thong made the list. \u201cEveryone seems to wear these,\u201d she says. \u201cThey come in every color, like 30 colors, and it\u2019s like a lace crayon box when you open your drawer.\u201d The thing about them, according to Corcoran, is that \u201cthey\u2019re inexpensive and last forever.\u201d She says she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s ever thrown a pair out, and that the stretch material never gives up, despite the fact that they don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re wearing underwear. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve worn just these with a skirt (I need pantyhose), but they\u2019re just great and never, never wrinkle,\u201d Corcoran says. And if you want to stock up, Hanky Panky\u2019s three-packs are a good option. Iva Pawling, co-founder of Richer Poorer, prefers the brand\u2019s low-rise style, of which she has many. \u201cI am equal parts proud and embarrassed that I have only been wearing Hanky Panky underwear for, oh, about 14 years,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have to think about them, and they just work.\u201d For something with more coverage, costume designer Leesa Evans told us, \u201cHanky Panky boy shorts are so soft and comfortable, and never show a panty line.\u201d\n\nBest cotton bikinis and briefs for women\n\nNatori Bliss Cotton Girl Briefs Cora Harrington (a.k.a. the Lingerie Addict), the author of In Intimate Detail: How to Choose, Wear, and Love Lingerie, says that if you want something you can easily find at your local department store, Natori\u2019s Girl Briefs are her favorite \u201cmainstream\u201d underwear (we heard about Harrington\u2019s more obscure picks, too, which are further down this list). \u201cThey\u2019re cute. They\u2019re comfy. The Pima cotton means they\u2019re supersoft,\u201d she explains. \u201cNordstrom includes them in their annual anniversary sale, and my secret tip is to buy discontinued colorways \u2026 after all, no one cares what color your underwear is!\u201d Dolley Frearson, co-founder and creative director of High Fashion Home, is another fan of the Natori Girl Briefs. \u201cFor everyday underwear, I need it to feel comfortable and breathable,\u201d she says. \u201cI also need it to appear smooth, and not pinch my skin in any place or ride up.\u201d For Frearson, the Natori briefs check all of those boxes. \u201cThey will eventually replace almost all of your underwear in your drawer,\u201d she promises. $20 at Macy's Buy $12 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nPhoto: Reid, Hilary Gap Stretch Cotton High Leg Brief Man Repeller deputy editor Haley Nahman, who conducted her own extensive research about the best cotton underwear, told us that this pair from the Gap is her favorite. \u201cGap describes this underwear as \u2018high cut,\u2019 but I beg to differ: It\u2019s the most classic brief shape I\u2019ve ever encountered,\u201d Nahman says. \u201cI discovered them when I was on a maniacal hunt for the best cotton underwear \u2014 an endeavor that pitted these against several more expensive (and lauded) options. In the end, Gap won.\u201d She says these are \u201ccomfortable, cute, affordable, and perfectly basic,\u201d not to mention 100 percent cotton. \u201cAsking for more would just be greedy.\u201d $11 at Gap Buy\n\nODDOBODY Full Brief Laura Schubert, co-founder of pubic-hair-oil company Fur, says ODDOBODY\u2019s underwear is \u201cperfect\u201d \u2014 especially the brief. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic,\u201d she says. \u201cI love a classic brief because they are comfortable and easy to wear. The stitching and fabric ensures that they don\u2019t bunch or have weird lines.\u201d Schubert also likes that the brand\u2019s pieces are made of 100 percent cotton, and that ODDOBODY \u201cpromotes speaking comfortably about bodies, health, and identity.\u201d $24 at ODDOBODY Buy\n\nPansy Low Rise Underwear \u201cI love Pansy for underwear,\u201d says Alyssa Lau, the founder of sustainability-focused e-retailer New Classics Studios. She calls the California-based ethical underwear company\u2019s pieces \u201csturdy and beautifully crafted,\u201d and notes that they\u2019re made from organic cotton that\u2019s grown and milled in the U.S. \u201cFor me, wearing underwear that\u2019s comfortable, easy to care for, made to last, and crafted with natural fabrics (for the breathability!) is very important,\u201d Lau told us. \u201cPansy checks all those boxes.\u201d $39 at Pansy Buy\n\nLogo Cotton Stretch Bikini When we asked rapper Junglepussy about her pick, she told us she\u2019s \u201cvery loyal\u201d to Calvin Klein underwear. \u201cJust ask my boo, he sees them every sleepover and probably assumes they sponsor me, but it\u2019s my hard-earned dollars maintaining this luxury,\u201d she says. \u201cThey give me a smooth finish under fitted clothing and their fabric keeps the coochie fresca. I have every color Calvin in these cuts.\u201d $13 at Macy's Buy\n\nJoe Boxer Women\u2019s 6-Pack Low-Rise String Bikini Panties \u2014 Assorted Lena Dunham told us that she loves \u201ca slightly baggy, but fun underpant,\u201d and called out these Joe Boxer string bikinis as ones that fit the bill. \u201cJoe Boxer was cool and hip when I was 12, and now it\u2019s a Kmart property. Leaving aside the ethical implications of that, I fucking love the underwear,\u201d Dunham says. She told us she orders the bikinis in a large to get her preferred loose fit. \u201cA medium might be more supportive of my butt, but this gives me a little tail,\u201d she says. \u201cA six-pack of three solids and three patterns for me is the perfect balance.\u201d $5 for 6 at Kmart Buy\n\nHanro Cotton Sensation Mini Bikini Lisa Buhler, founder of Lisa Says Gah, told us that she\u2019s a big fan of Swiss lingerie brand Hanro for its \u201cluxe fabrics and classic designs.\u201d (The brand also came up when we talked to some cool and stylish women about their favorite bathrobes.) If the price of the Hanro bikini is a little steep, Buhler suggests Everlane\u2019s underwear, which she says has a similar design to Hanro at a fraction of the price. $34 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nEgretta Garzetta Hipster Panties For something a little more colorful, take a note from Harrington, who says her \u201cfavorite underwear brand of all time is Egretta Garzetta.\u201d She told us that because of a nerve condition, her everyday underwear has to be made from natural fibers, and the brand\u2019s cotton and viscose briefs have been an \u201cabsolute godsend.\u201d And although the price is higher than, say, a pair from the Gap, the quality of these is also very high, according to Harrington. \u201cSeriously, this is the highest-quality underwear I own,\u201d she says. \u201cI first purchased from this brand back in 2014, and my underwear is still holding up and looking great; no fraying, no holes, just pure cotton softness.\u201d $25 at Etsy Buy\n\nBest no-show underwear for women\n\nPhoto: Retailer Negative Underwear Silky Brief Luisana Mendoza de Roccia, co-founder of Maisonette, calls the brand Negative Underwear her \u201cno-fuss underwear solution.\u201d She says all of the styles are sleek and lay smoothly on the body, and that she can feel confident that they\u2019ll stay in place during the day. \u201cFor the daytime, I\u2019ll go for the cotton briefs, and for evening affairs where I want to feel a bit more luxe, I\u2019ll pull out the silky briefs,\u201d de Roccia told us. \u201cPlus they\u2019re made by women for women, so you can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d $35 at Negative Underwear Buy\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret No Show Cheeky Panty Model and actress Hari Nef told us that a nude, no-show panty is a must for shoots, where you never know what they\u2019ll put you in. \u201cIf it\u2019s a white sheer dress, and you\u2019re in your Hello Kitty underwear, that\u2019s not the look,\u201d she says. Victoria\u2019s Secret No Show \u201cdisappear underneath whatever you\u2019re wearing,\u201d according to Nef. \u201cYou can wear a body-con dress, and it\u2019s fine. And it\u2019s also not a thong, at least not the way we traditionally think of them. I hate those.\u201d $11 at Victoria's Secret Buy\n\nBest mesh, velvet, and silk underwear for women\n\n\n\n\n\nBaserange Red Bell Pants Writer Carnelia Garcia, a former retail director and buyer for Maryam Nassir Zadeh, says she loves Baserange\u2019s velour underwear. \u201cThey also make really easy pullover bras that have no hardware, which I love because I\u2019m not always a fan of feeling wire or hook closures,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cAnd obviously, one must get the matching panty for a comfy set.\u201d $48 at The Dreslyn Buy\n\nOn Gossamer Mesh Bikini \u201cMy underwear drawer is the most boring place in the world, because all I have are dozens of pairs of the same thing: On Gossamer\u2019s Mesh Bikinis,\u201d says Kim France, the founding editor of Lucky, who counted these as an item she can\u2019t live without. \u201cIt is so far and away the perfect underwear that I have a hard time understanding why anybody wears anything else: It\u2019s superlight, highly breathable, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 hugely VPL-resistant. Seriously, it\u2019s as VPL-resistant as a thong, but without the annoyingness of a thong,\u201d she says. France isn\u2019t the only one who loves On Gossamer mesh bikinis \u2014 they have also been a many-time Strategist best seller. $20 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer Harlow & Fox Eleanor Almond French Knicker If you want to splurge, Harrington recommends a pair of silk tap shorts, like this pair from Harlow & Fox. \u201cSilk is the ultimate lingerie fiber \u2014 cool in the summer, warm in the winter, and with a luxurious feel against the skin,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can afford silk, buy silk.\u201d Harrington calls these her favorite elegant silk pair, and \u201cthe definition of everyday indulgence.\u201c $123 at Harlow & Fox Buy\n\nBest high-rise women\u2019s underwear\n\nJockey Women\u2019s Underwear Elance Brief \u2014 3 Pack Former Strategist writer and editor Margaret Rhodes wrote an ode to these high-rise briefs, which she says are like \u201ca warm embrace,\u201d and akin to curling up with a hot-water bottle or a puppy. Part of the Elance\u2019s magic, according to Rhodes, is that \u201cunlike the chic \u2014 even slightly sexy \u2014 grandma-esque briefs from lines like Araks and Baserange, the plain cotton Elance leaves pretty much everything to the imagination. You don\u2019t wear these undergarments \u2014 they wear you. More exactly, they swaddle you.\u201d $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nBotanica Workshop Astra Hi-Waist Brief Another pair of high-waist briefs that fall closer to the Araks and Baserange spectrum of comfy-but-chic underwear comes to us from Adele Tetangco, co-founder of Garmentory, who says that she\u2019s a fan of Botanica Workshop\u2019s 100 percent organic, made in the USA pieces. \u201cI prefer underwear that I can\u2019t feel on my body. It has to just feel like an extension of my outfit,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Astra high-waist briefs feel like you\u2019re going commando. They\u2019re so comfortable.\u201d $65 at Garmentory Buy\n\nHigh Rise Hipster \u201cA good high-waisted moment can make your butt look like it\u2019s starring in its own \u201990s Calvin Klein commercial,\u201d according to former Strategist writer and current Self editor Lori Keong, who says this high-rise Everlane pair will do the trick. \u201cThese slide right up to your navel, hug but don\u2019t squeeze your midrange, and don\u2019t lose their shape or bunch up around your hips during the day,\u201d she says. \u201cThey flatter your waist and hug your curves, but don\u2019t pinch at the waistline like other elastic briefs or ride up.\u201d They pass the VPL test, too. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be really squinting to detect any VPL,\u201d Keong says. $12 at Everlane Buy\n\nBest thongs for women\n\nLa Perla Freedom Brazilian Thong When we talked to model, actress, and entrepreneur Amber Rose about the things she can\u2019t live without, she told us a story about going underwear shopping: \u201cSo my friend Chyna, we were at Neiman\u2019s the other day, and I was picking out some La Perla underwear,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThey were like $120, and Chyna is like, \u2018What the hell are you doing? Why are you buying such expensive underwear?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Girl this is going to change your life,\u2019 so I bought her a pair.\u201d If you\u2019re on the fence about splurging on pair of underwear, Rose makes a compelling case for doing so. \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but wearing expensive underwear under your clothes gives you a certain type of confidence in a really cool way.\u201d $74 at Neiman Marcus Buy\n\nNude v1 Essaouira Thong Stylist Christina Pacelli also likes Negative Underwear, and told us it\u2019s her go-to brand for \u201csuper comfortable, cute, sexy, and also functional\u201d thongs. \u201cBy functional, I mean they stay in place comfortably when worn with the various skirts and high-waisted pants I wear, and no lines ever show through,\u201d she says. $30 at Negative Underwear Buy\n\nCosabella Dolce G-string For something truly no-show, a G-string is a reliable and, in keeping with current trends, slightly \u201990s option. Model and creative director Alexandra Spencer says that her everyday G-strings are from Cosabella. \u201cThey\u2019re cotton, and I like that they sit higher, and just generally make you look good in a \u201990s Empire Records way,\u201d she says. $19 at Amazon Buy $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nMarieyat Black Bex Thong \u201cI love a good high-waist; they bring me back to Christy Turlington days,\u201d says Christina Viviani, cofounder of the Great Eros. Viviani notes that despite its comfort factor, sometimes high-waisted underwear can be unflattering. Marieyat\u2019s thongs are no such thing, though: \u201cThe aesthetic is beautiful, and the cuts are really flattering and unconventional,\u201d Viviani says of the brand. \u201cIn my store in Williamsburg, we also sell a style called the Canova \u201990s Overt cut like a \u201990s bikini with an overt, in a fine Italian sporty mesh, that makes a woman look long.\u201d $45 at Better for Living Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
