He then went on to serve in a string of governments, including under Netanyahu, but quit as his defence chief last November in protest at a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nSince Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government after an election in April, Lieberman, 61, has refocused his political strategy to attract new supporters.\n\nWith opinion polls predicting Yisrael Beitenu will double to 10 the number of parliamentary seats it won in the election five months ago, Lieberman could be the linchpin in determining the composition and leadership of the next governing coalition.\n\nIt was Lieberman who handed Netanyahu a rare defeat after the April election. Netanyahu needed Yisrael Beignet\u2019s five seats to secure a majority of 61 in the 120-member parliament but Lieberman rejected his approaches.\n\nLieberman is pushing for a \u201cnational unity\u201d government after Tuesday\u2019s poll that would include his own party, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud and its strongest challenger, the centrist Blue and White party, but exclude what he calls \u201cmessianic\u201d religious factions.\n\nWhere Netanyahu fits in is anyone\u2019s guess. Blue and White\u2019s leader, Benny Gantz, citing looming corruption indictments against the prime minister, says he is open to teaming up with Likud, but not if it is led by Netanyahu.\n\nSo far, potential successors to Netanyahu, who has denied wrongdoing in three criminal cases against him, have remained loyal. But no one party has ever won an outright parliamentary majority on its own in Israel and national politics are fluid.\n\n\u201c(Lieberman) has an ability to crown the next prime minister - and he knows it very well,\u201d said Dmitri Doubov, editor in chief of Israel\u2019s Russian-language Channel 9 television.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that he sees himself as the next prime minister but he can set the conditions for the next coalition to define it as he wants, as he sees fit.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (R) and Avigdor Lieberman attend a Likud-Beitenu faction meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in Jerusalem November 11, 2013.

Lieberman gave his differences with an ultra-Orthodox party over a conscription bill as the reason for refusing to join the coalition Netanyahu had seemed poised to form after the election in April.\n\nLieberman\u2019s frequent complaints about ultra-Orthodox political power and influence over everyday life in Israel, including the administration of marriage and divorce, have played well with his Russian-speaking immigrants, some of whom are not Jewish according to ritual law.\n\nIf the opinion polls showing a surge in support for Yisrael Beitenu are correct, his message is also now resonating with secular Israelis outside his power base.\n\nIn the port city of Ashdod, south of Tel Aviv, Jonathan Joseph Motro, a 28-year-old student, said he was looking for a candidate who was right-wing but not in step with the ultra-Orthodox. Lieberman fits the bill, he said.\n\n\u201cI voted Likud for a long time, now I\u2019m voting for Lieberman,\u201d Motro said.\n\nSpeaking at a public forum of \u201cinfluencers\u201d organised by Israel\u2019s Channel 12 TV last week, Lieberman said in his usual deadpan delivery that \u201cthere is nothing personal\u201d in his criticism of Netanyahu.\n\nBack in the days of their early relationship, Lieberman would be at Netanyahu\u2019s side during campaigning.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\n\u201cLieberman scheduled Netanyahu\u2019s visits to Likud branches around the country, arriving in advance with signs to hang in the hall and a crisp powder-blue shirt for his fastidious boss to change into before his speech, Anshel Pfeffer, author of a Netanyahu biography, wrote in the Haaretz newspaper.\n\nAt the Channel 12 event, Lieberman said he did not rule out Netanyahu as a political ally or underestimate a veteran leader hailed by chanting Likud faithful after previous election victories as a \u201cmagician\u201d.\n\n\u201c(But) I will not go to a Halacha government,\u201d he said, in a reference to Jewish ritual law and ultra-Orthodox party participation in a coalition.", "description": "A former nightclub bouncer with a heavy Russian accent, Avigdor Lieberman used to carry a fresh change of shirt for his political boss, Benjamin Netanyahu.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429524375&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1HD", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
