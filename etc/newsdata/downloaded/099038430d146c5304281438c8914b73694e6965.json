We thought would make a difference.\"\n\nAt the time, the BBC's royal editor said her words were \"more of an observation than an intervention\", while Buckingham Palace said any suggestion the Queen was seeking to influence the outcome of the referendum was \"categorically wrong\".\n\nOfficials insisted the monarch was above politics, and the issue of Scotland's future was a matter for the people.\n\nTwo weeks after the Scottish referendum, Mr Cameron was forced to apologise after suggesting the Queen \"purred down the phone\" when she was told about the No result.\n\n'Unfinished business'\n\nWhile he feels \"sorry\" about events since the 2016 Brexit vote, Mr Cameron said he did not regret the decision to hold the EU referendum.\n\nWhile some people would \"never forgive\" him, he maintained the UK's 40-year membership was becoming \"unstable\" and the duty of leaders was to \"see difficulties coming and try to resolve them and shape the country's response to them\".\n\nHe accepted he \"totally underestimated the latent Leave gene\" in his party and that during the campaign while \"he had a winning hand, he could not seem to play it\".\n\nAfter losing the vote, Mr Cameron said he knew he had to quit because he did not have the \"credibility to deliver Brexit\", but was \"desperately sad\" his time in office was cut short.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Mr Cameron said the coalition government staved off a financial crisis\n\n\"I think of all the things we could and should have done if we had been able... to win the referendum,\" he recalls. \"A whole lot of what we could have done effectively ran into the sand of the European issue.\"\n\nOn his economic and social record, he rejects as \"total nonsense\" opponents' claims that he embraced deep spending cuts as a political choice to reduce the size of the state.\n\nHe says the multi-billion pound budget deficit inherited by his government in 2010 was a \"clear and present danger to the British economy\" requiring immediate action.\n\n\"In the end there were difficult and painful decisions, but inequality fell and the share of income tax paid by the richest went up, not down,\" he argued. \"We protected pensioners, we protected the NHS, we protected help for the poorest.\"\n\nMr Cameron's long-awaited memoirs, entitled For The Record, will be published on 19 September.\n\nIn excerpts published by the Times last week, he accused Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of behaving \"appallingly\" during the Brexit referendum.\n\nThe first episode of The Cameron Years will be broadcast on BBC One at 21.00 BST.", "description": "The ex-PM spoke to royal officials about her \"raising an eyebrow\" at the prospect of independence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/157DA/production/_108862088_gettyimages-158508447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
