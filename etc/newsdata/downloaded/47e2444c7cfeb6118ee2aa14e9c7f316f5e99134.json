(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nWhile It Chapter Two attempts to incorporate some of the ideas about homophobia that Stephen King originally wrote into his novel about a murderous, demon clown terrorizing a small town in Maine, the movie does so in such a clumsy, de-fanged way that by the end, you\u2019re left with the sense that the filmmakers weren\u2019t really willing to follow through on what they set out to do.\n\nThere are more than a few suggestions throughout It Chapter Two that Bill Hader\u2019s Richie Tozier might be queer \u2014 like when Pennywise literally comes charging at him singing \u201cI know your secret.\u201d But the character never ends up actually saying that he isn\u2019t straight. There\u2019s a moment toward the end when Richie\u2019s seen carving his deceased friend Eddie\u2019s initial (Pennywise got him) alongside his, implying that Richie might have had feelings for him, but it\u2019s all left unsaid, and somewhat open to interpretation.\n\nNarratives about people who still aren\u2019t prepared to openly embrace the truth about their sexual orientations are valid, but there are plenty of better ways to explore those ideas than having a character silently pine for his dead, presumably straight friend. The pain and anguish Richie experienced growing up in Derry and watching Eddie die is a prime storytelling opportunity if you know how to look at those ideas the right way \u2014 and while It Chapter Two doesn\u2019t, really, Bill Hader certainly does.\n\nIt Chapter Two's Queer Subplot Is Too Subtextual To Be Scary Good It Chapter Two opens with a horrific, homophobic hate crime that Stephen King plucked from the headlines and incorporated into his 1986 novel. After a group of very human bigots attack Adrian Mellon and his boyfriend, they unceremoniously dump Adrian over the side of the bridge, and just as he begins to drown, he sees a figure beckoning him from the shore. A clown.

Richie, Hader reflected, definitely has anxieties about his identity, and it\u2019s precisely what Pennywise is targeting him for:\n\n\u201cWell I think Richie had, you know, an issue \u2014 especially growing up in a small town everything \u2014 with his sexuality. I think the real first time he ever actually, I think, felt love for somebody was Eddie, you know, in his own way of dealing with it. A lot of comedians... you know, you\u2019re really funny, but you use comedy as a boundary between other people and also as boundary in your own feelings. Pennywise says \u2018I know your secret.\u2019 It\u2019s the thing that you don\u2019t think anybody knows about. He doesn\u2019t understand it about himself, probably. I think going back [to Derry] for him was having to kind of face that aspect of himself and what\u2019s kind of tragic about the movie is that he can\u2019t really consummate that with the person he loves. Not just in a sexual way but just in an actual emotional way.\u201d\n\nEverything that Hader\u2019s saying is exactly the kind of complicated characterisation that you\u2019d want from a nuanced depiction of a closeted person. Because It Chapter Two foregoes it in favour of the vaguest of suggestions that Richie might have had a crush on another boy when he was young, all the potential just ended up being largely squandered.", "description": "While It Chapter Two attempts to incorporate some of the ideas about homophobia that Stephen King originally wrote into his novel about a murderous, demon clown terrorizing a small town in Maine, the movie does so in such a clumsy, de-fanged way that by the end, you\u2019re left with the sense that the filmmakers...", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Jason Torchinsky"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/r2cjh0ik3zyuackcweyn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
