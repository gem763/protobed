Or is she saying it is Rebekah's account? When I read that, although the end bit talks about it being the account, there's a couple of uses of the word \"person\" beforehand, I think there's a good argument that is saying it is Rebekah, or at least very likely it is Rebekah.\n\n'At that point, Rebekah has a claim. But where does that take her? That takes her to court where we will establish if it's true or not.'\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation\n\nHe went on: 'Everything on the internet is traceable to an individual, so we will be able to find out one way or another whether this was someone using Rebekah's account without permission, or if it was her with the data behind it.'\n\nVictoria asked: 'So you can pinpoint exactly how you can find out who has had access to your account?'\n\nTo which Mr Sherrell replied: 'Yes, Rebekah will be able to go to Instagram and ask \"which time and date my Instagram was accessed\". they will say for example, \"10am on this Monday and someone accessed your account using this broadband account, say BT\".'\n\nHe added: 'So then we will go to BT and ask for the address that had that account, so we will get an address and get down to a person in a house.\n\n'And it's true, with everything on the internet, if you look hard enough you can find out who it is.'\n\nAn insider exclusively told MailOnline on Wednesday night that 'Rebekah wants to prove she had nothing to do with the leaked stories and is working with a lawyer and IT experts who can look at the forensics of her Instagram, which several people have access to.'\n\nThey added: 'Rebekah has been incredibly stressed and hasn't stopped sobbing all day, which is very out of character for her.\n\n'The whole situation has left her distraught and she still doesn't understand why Coleen didn't reach out to her first to ask her outright about the issue.\n\nPolice have attended Jamie and Rebekah Vardy's home after Mrs Vardy received apparent death threats in the wake of her row with Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen\n\nPregnant Rebekah, pictured with her husband last month, has published some of the messages she has received online\n\n'She's flying home early from Dubai as she feels her time abroad has been spoilt and all she wants is to be surrounded by family.\n\nA spokesman for Coleen said: 'It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.'\n\nThe scandal has gripped the nation to such an extent that police officers went to the Vardys' home because of the horrific trolling they faced.\n\nThe couple are currently on holiday in Dubai but police arrived at their home in Lincolnshire to check on their security in the wake of the vile messages Rebekah had received.\n\nLincolnshire Police officers spent about 20 minutes at the property speaking to security guards.", "description": "The pair are now communicating only through their lawyers after the bitter row which has seen Rebekah Vardy, still on holiday in Dubai, threaten Coleen Rooney with legal action.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/01/19612712-0-image-a-45_1570839321151.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
