As many as 100,000 people were killed between 1998 and 2000 when a border dispute flared into an all-out war.\n\nAD\n\nAbiy, a 43-year-old former intelligence officer, has ushered in an era of hope for peace and greater freedoms in Africa\u2019s second-most populous country, which has long been governed by authoritarian regimes. Upon taking office in April 2018, Abiy initiated the release of thousands of political prisoners, lifted bans on various political organizations, prosecuted former officials accused of torture and vowed to move Ethiopia toward its first free, multiparty elections in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAbiy has also made bold moves to broker peace in neighboring Sudan and South Sudan, both beset by civil conflict. Abiy spearheaded rounds of talks between opposing sides in both countries, and he has sought a role in mediating other regional conflicts such as a maritime dispute between neighboring Kenya and Somalia.\n\nIn a statement, Abiy\u2019s office said that \u201cthis victory and recognition is a collective win for Ethiopians, and a call to strengthen our resolve in making Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia \u2014 the New Horizon of Hope \u2014 a prosperous nation for all.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAbiy\u2019s recognition by the Norway-based Nobel Committee was reminiscent of President Barack Obama\u2019s 10 years earlier. Like Obama at the time, Abiy is near the beginning of his term and has not yet fully implemented the broad reforms and peace deals he has set out to accomplish. But his initial decisions in office have prompted an outpouring of hope that those stated objectives will be achieved.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo doubt some people will think this year\u2019s prize is being awarded too early,\u201d Reiss-Andersen said in her announcement of the prize. \u201cThe Norwegian Nobel Committee believes it is now that Abiy Ahmed\u2019s efforts deserve recognition and need encouragement.\u201d\n\nEthiopia remains one of the world\u2019s most insecure countries, with more than 3 million people displaced from their homes and more than 1,000 killed in 2018, mostly due to ethnic strife. The country\u2019s economy is dangerously weak, and tens of thousands of Ethiopians have become refugees in search of less dire conditions. Abiy\u2019s proposed reforms are also seen by some in Ethiopia as likely to exacerbate ethnic tensions, and he has already survived one assassination attempt.\n\nAD\n\nAbiy\u2019s peace deal with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki also has yet to result in a full resumption of normal ties, largely because of Eritrean reluctance. Conscription is still mandatory in Eritrea, despite the end of the military standoff with Ethiopia.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe peace deal unfroze diplomatic relations, reopened telephone lines and has allowed some travel between the two countries,\u201d said William Davison, an Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cBut key border disputes are unresolved, and Eritrea remains without constitutional government, so there has been no peace dividend yet for its long-suffering citizens.\u201d\n\nAbiy was born to parents who belonged to different ethnic groups, which is unusual in Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia. Some analysts say that background makes his calls for unity more effective in a country divided politically into nine semiautonomous sub-nations. In interviews with local media, he has recalled a poor upbringing, sleeping on the floor and lacking electricity and water \u2014 both still unavailable to large portions of Ethiopia\u2019s population.\n\nAD\n\nAbiy is the third sitting head of government from Africa to win the Nobel Peace Prize, after Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia and F.W. de Klerk of South Africa, who won jointly with Nelson Mandela in 1993 as South Africa transitioned out of its apartheid era.\n\nAD\n\nLast year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to Denis Mukwege, 64, a Congolese doctor who treated thousands of women who were raped or sexually assaulted as a result of conflict, and Nadia Murad, 26, who advocated for the support of Yazidi women captured and held as sex slaves at the hands of the Islamic State.", "description": "Abiy, 43, has initiated democratic reforms and sought to resolve conflicts in the region.", "authors": ["Max Bearak", "Africa Bureau Chief Based In Nairobi"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FTfuO8Hop0eJz13xJWDGYdqnVsI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SXYDJWXMAYI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
