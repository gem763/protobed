It\u2019s demanded that a key part of your identity is that you are part of the elite class.\n\n\u201cAnyone that goes against that culture is disowned and torched. The people that participate (in sexist chanting) are the most privileged and elite men in Melbourne.\n\n\u201cThey know they can probably get away with it. The privilege gives them the confidence to do whatever they want to do.\u201d\n\nHeadmaster Stephen Russell responded to the video with a strong message to parents and a public apology. He promised he \u201cwill not let this matter lie\u201d.\n\nBut in a second letter to parents, sent to news.com.au, Mr Russell admits the problem is far worse than he first suspected.\n\n\u201cSadly, we are aware that the use of misogynistic language such as in the chant on Saturday, is more widespread than we understood and this knowledge has intensified our determination to resolutely reshape our programs and to look to do so much more in this area,\u201d Mr Russell wrote.\n\n\u201cThe size of our challenge has been clearly illustrated to me by my knowledge that some recent graduates foolishly and recklessly thought it would be amusing when they were celebrating to use this horrible chant.\u201d\n\nKiernan said he welcomes the action by the school, but it\u2019s too little too late.\n\n\u201cWomen have been making these complaints about this sort of behaviour for ages and those have not been responded to whatsoever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only when there\u2019s significant media attention and a former student \u2014 a student who is a man \u2014 comes out that these allegations are taken seriously.\u201d\n\nNews.com.au spoke this morning with India, a young woman who graduated from St Kevin\u2019s sister school.\n\nIndia, 19, said she saw first hand the impact the macho culture was having.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had experiences with hearing chants like that before and seeing behaviour that isn\u2019t the best,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to parties where I was harassed by people and it always kind of ends up being a St Kevin\u2019s student.\u201d\n\nShe said she was dating a St Kevin\u2019s student for a while and after they broke up things turned ugly for her.\n\n\u201cAt a party I saw him and he got all his friends to gang up on me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey would block me off from parts of the party. They all started touching my face and other parts and it wouldn\u2019t stop until one of St Kevin\u2019s boys intervened and then he was ridiculed for it.\n\n\u201cWith that incident, it was a bunch of guys all ganging up on me. The guy who stopped it was called a \u2018party pooper\u2019. The boys said to him: \u2018We\u2019re just having some fun\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe young woman, who had a brother attend St Kevin\u2019s as a primary school student before he was pulled out, said \u201cyou can see it happening with boys being built up that they\u2019re the best.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re told, \u2018This is the best school for you, you\u2019re the best of the best\u2019. You can see it as early as primary school, this pack mentality starting to form.\u201d\n\nrohan.smith1@news.com.au | @ro_smith", "description": "Luka Kiernan\u2019s image on the High Academic Achiever\u2019s Board at prestigious St Kevin\u2019s College has been defaced with the words \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201csnitch\u201d after he spoke out against sexist chanting on a Melbourne tram this week.", "authors": ["Rohan Smith"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5da3595449021ee5777e5c6d5fa01abc?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
