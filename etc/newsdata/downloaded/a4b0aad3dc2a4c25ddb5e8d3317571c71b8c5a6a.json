It is only when this debate begins that we will know which amendments have been selected for a vote by the Speaker, John Bercow.\n\nThe number of amendments will affect the length of the process, so the key vote could come any time from mid-afternoon to early evening. If the government loses the vote, the prime minister could then seek a vote on leaving without a deal, which is the only other way to avoid the so-called Benn act \u2013 the backbench-created law that would compel Johnson to seek a Brexit extension if his deal is not passed or no deal is not approved.\n\nWill there be amendments?\n\nSome have already been tabled, for example one to extend the Brexit deadline. Another amendment has been tabled to secure a second referendum, but this would be attached to the no-deal motion, so seems unlikely to go to a vote.\n\nWill there definitely be an all-or-nothing vote?\n\nThe big decision could be delayed again. A potentially key amendment tabled by Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn and others would withhold full approval for the Brexit deal until all the associated legislation was passed.\n\nThis would seem likely to require another extension, and would delay the real moment of truth for MPs. One reason for this amendment would be to prevent the possibility of hardline Brexit Conservatives approving the deal \u2013 thus removing the conditions of the Benn act \u2013 but then voting down the subsequent withdrawal agreement bill, which implements the legally binding treaty, and so forcing no deal anyway.\n\nLabour is understood to be likely to back this amendment, and former Tory MPs including Amber Rudd and David Gauke have said they would vote for it.\n\nWill MPs know the full implications of the deal?\n\nNot really. The deal was cobbled together and agreed with the EU in a huge rush, and MPs will have only a few hours of debate in the Commons before making a hugely important decision. Downing Street has said MPs will not see official economic impact assessments of the plan in advance, despite some requesting this.\n\nWhat happens if the plan passes?\n\nIf it passes unamended, this would still be the first stage of the process, and even with Downing Street promising that MPs would work around the clock as needed, there is no guarantee everything will be done by 31 October. No 10 would hope to present the bill to the Commons as early as Monday. If the deal motion is amended, for example by the Letwin-Benn plan, a delay to departure is more likely.\n\nDo we get no deal if the plan is rejected?\n\nMost likely not, even though Johnson seems set to frame the vote in these terms, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, briefly startled remain-minded MPs by telling reporters he did not think another Brexit extension would be granted. EU sources have said that if Johnson\u2019s deal is rejected, meaning the Benn act would come into force, they would not reject a UK request for another extension.\n\nWhich MPs are key to whether it passes?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, and leader, Arlene Foster, have said they won\u2019t back the deal. Photograph: Rebecca Black/PA\n\nWith the DUP definitely against the deal, and a number of the former Tory MPs who lost the whip last month seemingly onboard, two groups will be vital. First are the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d, the most hardline of Tory Brexiters. Some of these have already said they would back the bill, and others could follow \u2013 but with the DUP opposed, this is still a finely balanced decision.\n\nThe other group set to be endlessly pestered by Johnson\u2019s team are Labour MPs from leave-voting areas who support a deal, such as Caroline Flint, Stephen Kinnock and others. They face intense Labour pressure to vote against it, but could still potentially be persuaded the vote the other way. These MPs might be more likely to back the deal if it was amended via the Letwin-Benn plan.\n\nSo will it pass \u2013 and if so, is it all over?\n\nOn the first point \u2013 no one knows. The final tally could come within a couple of votes. It is worth remembering that Theresa May\u2019s defeats on her Brexit deal ended up being heavier than expected. However, some momentum seem to be with Johnson. As to the second question: no, not at all. Even if the deal is passed, this is but the first step in a long parliamentary process, which would in turn shape an evolving and still very controversial departure process over many years. Prepare for much, much more of this.\n\nMPs to watch\n\nSteve Baker: the Tory hard Brexiters\u2019 club, the European Research Group, met first thing on Saturday. Its chair has told the group that they should vote for Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The ERG chair, Steve Baker, is likely to be a key indicator for the Spartans\u2019 voting intentions.

If she backs Johnson\u2019s deal she could take others with her.\n\nNorman Lamb: while the rest of the Liberal Democrats are firmly against the deal, Lamb \u2013 who will step down at the next election \u2013 has long been much more Brexit-minded than his colleagues. However, he said on Saturday morning he could not support the deal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Norman Lamb is said to be still deciding how to vote.
