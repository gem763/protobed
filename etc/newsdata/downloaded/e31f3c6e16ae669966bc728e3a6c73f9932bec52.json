Mitt Romney of Utah, the former Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor, is also, apparently, the man behind a Twitter account that uses the moniker \u201cPierre Delecto.\u201d\n\nRomney on Sunday admitted to McKay Coppins, a writer at The Atlantic, that he was responsible for the social media account, which he uses to covertly monitor political discourse and occasionally defend himself. It\u2019s unclear what, if anything, Pierre Delecto is a reference to.\n\nSeveral events preceded the admission.\n\nFirst, The Atlantic published Sunday a profile of Romney, one of the few prominent Republican lawmakers to criticize President Donald Trump over his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Those efforts form the basis of an impeachment investigation by the House.\n\nTrump lashed out in response this month, calling the senator on Twitter a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning.\u201d In one tweet, the president used the hashtag \u201c#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY.\u201d\n\nIn the Atlantic profile, Romney admitted to having what he called a \u201clurker account\u201d \u2014 essentially a profile under a different name that he operated in secret to monitor the political conversation. But he declined to divulge the name associated with the account.\n\nThe admission spurred curiosity, particularly that of the online newsmagazine Slate.\n\nSlate theorized that Pierre Delecto, or Twitter user @qaws9876, was Romney after it discovered the account among the Twitter followers of one of his grandchildren.\n\nSlate\u2019s Ashley Feinberg found that Pierre Delecto\u2019s first follower was Romney\u2019s oldest son, Tagg. The account was created in 2011, shortly after Romney announced his intention to run for president. The account also followed all of Romney\u2019s children who are on Twitter and several former advisers, according to Slate.\n\nThe account also posted several telling replies to Romney-related tweets, which were captured by screenshot before the account was made private Sunday night.\n\nIn one tweet from May, Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger at The Washington Post, said Romney\u2019s strategy on Trump was \u201cnon-confrontation verging on spinelessness.\u201d\n\n\u201cJennifer, you need to take a breath,\u201d Pierre Delecto replied. \u201cMaybe you can then acknowledge the people who agree with you in large measure even if not in every measure.\u201d\n\nThe Slate article prompted many on social media to surmise that if Pierre Delecto was in fact Romney, he had concocted one of the most extraordinary pseudonymous social media accounts for a public official ever (besting the former FBI director James B. Comey\u2019s onetime moniker of Reinhold Niebuhr).\n\nAfter Slate published its article, Coppins circled back with Romney to ask if he was indeed \u201cPierre Delecto.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust spoke to @MittRomney on the phone, and asked him about Pierre Delecto,\u201d Coppins said in a tweet. \u201cHis only response: \u201cC\u2019est moi.\u201d\u2019\n\nA spokeswoman for Romney did not directly answer questions about the account Sunday night. But in an email, the spokeswoman sent a link to the tweet from Coppins describing Romney\u2019s admission.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "Sen.
