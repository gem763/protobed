Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nThe saga began when Coleen took to social media to reveal she had suspected someone close to her had been betraying her for years and she had conclusive proof that her friend Rebekah was the guilty party.\n\nVardy is a queen of self-promotion who has risen to the top rank of footballers wives from humble beginnings - the daughter of a BBC local radio DJ and a window cleaner father who has two ex husbands.\n\nBefore meeting current husband Jamie, she was working in a Sheffield nightclub and dating a Vauxhall conference football player who has previously accused her of ditching him to 'trade up' to Premier League star.\n\nColeen admitted that stories about her basement flooding, returning to TV and gender selection were only viewed by Rebekah and these were subsequently followed by media outlets, including MailOnline.\n\nThe Sun has since removed their story about Coleen's basement flooding after discovering she had made it up.\n\nColeen wrote: 'For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n'There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n'After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account. '\n\nShock: Moreover, Wayne and Rebekah's footballer husband Jamie are also close friends and were pictured hugging one another at the same England vs Wales match - but it was previously claimed that Wayne had warned Jamie about his wife\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while).\n\n'Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nNothing to see here: The Sun have since removed their story about Wayne and Coleen's basement flooding after it transpired she had made it up - the page has been replaced with a melting ice cream picture\n\nWag-atha Christie: Coleen tweeted these words back in January, highlighting how she has been trying to get to the bottom of who was leaking stories on her life for some time\n\nFootballer's Wives: Netflix have even tweeted to say they are planning on turning this story into something major\n\nFuming: Rebekah (pictured in September) has said other people have access to her account as she appeared to be pointing the finger at her inner circle\n\nClose friends only: This is believed to be Coleen's private account - which is separate to the one she shares with the public\n\nIronic: Rebekah had shared this very post on Instagram on Monday\n\nThe FAKE stories Coleen shared which were sold to The Sun and followed by media outlets Wayne and Coleen Rooney's \u00a320m 'Morrisons' manor is 'flooded On Tuesday, it was claimed that the Rooney's basement had flooded due to Storm Lorenzo. It was said to have caused a 'massively stressful' setback in the completion of the sprawling three-storey mansion Coleen Rooney 'is so desperate for a baby girl that she's looked into controversial \u00a38K gender selection treatment' The Sun first reported that mother of four sons, Coleen had looked into 'gender selection' treatment in a desperate bid for a daughter and had flown to Mexico earlier this year to discuss the controversial \u00a38,000 treatment with doctors Coleen Rooney 'hopes to revive her TV career including a Strictly stint now she's moved back to the UK' after husband Wayne's scandal The Sun wrote that she was in talks to revive her once successful UK TV career now her family has moved back to this side of the Atlantic. The mother-of-four apparently had to decline the offer to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing but could compete in 2020\n\nShe also wrote: 'This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it......'\n\nRebekah, who is currently on holiday with Jamie in Dubai, hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations.\n\nShe wrote: 'Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even having to write this. I\u2019m pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I\u2019m now having to take legal advice as I can\u2019t deal with this stress myself when I\u2019m this pregnant.'\n\nShe also shared: 'As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n'I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n'If you thought this was happening you can could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'\n\nShe continued: 'Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n'I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n'I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n'I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened [broken heart emoji].'\n\nRebekah's spokesperson also told MailOnline: 'Please refer to Becky\u2019s social media posts.\n\n'It isn\u2019t true, she is now very upset and stressed so has passed it to her legal team to deal with. Such a shame that Coleen didn\u2019t just call her when she had her number.'\n\nTaking sides: Fellow WAG Danielle Lloyd clearly made her feelings known when she started replying to Coleen's post with RAT emojis\n\nNot supporting Vardy: A host of celebrities leaped to Coleen's defence and said they felt sorry for her\n\nA host of celebrities took to social media to air their views on the matter and most appeared to be taking Coleen's side.\n\nFellow former WAG Danielle Lloyd posted some rat emojis in the comments section of Coleen's post and even Wayne Rooney prostitute Helen Wood leaped to Coleen's defence.\n\nShe wrote: 'Probably shouldn\u2019t comment but going to anyway always said Rebekah Vardy was a snake in the grass hence why I\u2019m blocked her whole persona screamed it on the jungle. Sly eyes too.'\n\nShe also retweeted a post from Vardy from a fan who wrote: 'Rebekah Vardy really embarrassing herself with that reply to Coleen Rooney.'\n\nTV star Richard Osman wrote: 'I will vote for any political party who agree to immediately give us the rest of the day off so we can follow this Coleen Rooney/Rebekah Vardy thing properly.'\n\nIt's no secret that she knows how to maximise her potential as celebrity fodder. She and Jamie tied the knot at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire on May 25, 2016 and sold the rights to their wedding to Hello!\n\nShe has appeared regularly on Loose Women and This Morning as well as Good Morning Britain - she has had stints on Jeremy Vine's show and Celebrity Gogglebox.\n\nIn 2017, Rebekah appeared on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! but was the third person to be voted off.\n\nSome viewers called for her to leave the show after some of her homophobic tweets were unearthed\n\nThe tweets in question said: '@MrHarryWood: @Xelahopkins1984 @Little_Miss_Foz what about the 3rd \u201cbird\u201d the gay walker? @jay_walker25 ginger gay w**ker ha ha PMSL.'\n\nWhile, to the bystander, this tweet mostly doesn't make sense, the words 'gay' and 'ginger gay w**ker' caught the eye of her critics, demanding she be taken off the show.\n\nHowever her friend Jay Walker, who was mentioned in the tweets, stepped in to clear things up.\n\nClapping hands: People were telling Coleen to 'go girl' after her post was released\n\n'I hate to disappoint people '[but] this tweet was to me & we were all just repeating names a guy had called us.\n\n'Nothing homophobic about it & actually mocking someone who had been. Rebekah is the least homophobic or malicious person I know so afraid your all very much mistaken. Good luck Mrs Vardy.'\n\nShe also headed out to Russia with the family to support husband Jamie in the 2018 World Cup.\n\nRebekah previously had a one-night stand with singer Peter Andre in 2001 and has previously spoken about their relationship in the press, saying he had a 'chipolata penis.'\n\nShe gave an interview to The News Of The World about the fling, saying Peter was 'the worst lover' she'd ever had.\n\nAdding: 'He had great muscles and I thought he'd be a great lover. But he was the worst lover I have ever had. He didn't even attempt to satisfy me!'\n\nAwkward: In 2017, Rebekah's ex-partner and father of one of her children, Luke Foster discussed her relentless quest for fame when he gave an interview with The Mirror , saying at the time: 'I'm glad I am shot of her'\n\nIn 2017, Rebekah's ex-partner and father of one of her children, Luke Foster discussed her relentless quest for fame when he gave an interview with The Mirror, saying at the time: 'I'm glad I am shot of her.'\n\nHe claimed she told him shew had 'upgraded' him by dating Jamie, who was then earning \u00a380k per week as a Leicester player.\n\nLuke met Rebekah in 2007 - she already had daughter Megan and the couple had son Taylor, nine, together. He claimed her decision to appear on I'm A Celebrity was motivated by a desire to be more famous, not wealthier.\n\nThe ex lower-league footballer said: 'For Becky, going on the show is not about money. This is all about becoming famous. If someone had a better car than us, she'd want to go one better.\n\n'She's now got the husband she always wanted, one who can keep her in the lifestyle she's dreamt of. She's got the shopping, the house, the car. She's living her perfect life.\n\n'Becky upgraded. She said that to my face. She said he'd treat her a hell of a lot better.'\n\nThe couple split in 2013 and three months later Becky and Jamie were expecting their first child together - Becky is now expecting her third child with the footballer.\n\nShocked: Within minutes of Coleen's post, the internet was awash with reactionary memes from fans who couldn't believe what they were seeing\n\nMeanwhile, it's been reported that a Manchester poker player called Dave first gave Coleen the idea for her Vardy sting when he tweeted the idea to her back in January.\n\nHis idea came after Coleen first expressed a concern that someone close to her was leaking stories from her private social media account after it was reported she was involved in a car crash while on holiday.\n\nShe had written: 'Thank you for the messages asking if I am ok\u2026 the car crash story was completely wrong. I wasn't involved in a crash... the car was damaged by another car.\n\nGo on, Dave: Meanwhile, it's been reported that a Manchester poker player called Dave first gave Coleen the idea for her Vardy sting when he tweeted the idea to her back in January\n\nHe has since changed his Twitter bio to read: 'Detective who recently solved the Coleen Rooney vs Rebekah Vardy case'\n\n'Someone on my private Instagram [has] seen the picture and is telling or selling stories to a certain newspaper. It\u2019s happened several times now over the past couple of years.\n\nShe continued: 'It\u2019s sad to think someone, who I have accepted to follow me is betraying for either money or to keep a relationship with the press.'\n\nDave then responded: 'Make a false story tell people different things see which one comes out = find the culprit' - and although Coleen didn't reply to him, she did just that.\n\nHe told Daily Star on Wednesday: 'Firstly I hope Coleen is okay. To have a friend betray her like that is something you don't expect.'\n\nThe absolute lad has now changed his Twitter bio to read: 'Detective who recently solved the Coleen Rooney vs Rebekah Vardy case.'\n\nDid 'Dave' inspire Coleen's investigation? Coleen Rooney may have got the idea for her Vardy sting from a Manchester poker player who tweeted the idea to her back in January. His idea came after Coleen first expressed a concern that someone close to her was leaking stories. He tweeted: 'Make a false story tell people different things see which one comes out = find the culprit' He told Daily Star on Wednesday: ' 'Firstly I hope Coleen is okay. To have a friend betray her like that is something you don't expect.'\n\nIt was claimed back in 2016 that Wayne had 'warned' Jamie Vardy about Rebekah in England showdown talks in 2016.\n\nWayne and Jamie were both part of the England squad at Euro 2016 as the Three Lions were dumped out by Iceland.\n\nThe Times claimed Rooney told Vardy to make sure Rebekah didn't provide a distraction with her social media posts. She had earlier hit out at French police for treating England fans 'like animals'.\n\nEx England boss Roy Hodgson was forced to deny reports that Rooney and Vardy had fallen out during the Euro 2016 tournament.\n\nHodgson said: 'I haven't got a clue what you are referring to. There are absolutely no problems in football terms between Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy.\n\n'In fact quite the reverse, they are very close friends, both on the field and off the field. I have got no idea what you are referring to\n\n'I certainly would advise Wayne to give no comment to it because it is obviously one salacious story that someone has managed to spin. It is of no interest to us.'\n\nNot a nice thing to do: Rebekah previously had a one-night stand with singer Peter Andre in 2001 and has previously spoken about their relationship in the press, leaking a story to the News Of The World, saying he had a 'chipolata penis\n\nHousehold name: In 2017, Rebekah appeared on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! but was the third person to be voted off\n\nWith Rebekah making the list of Coleen's close followers and friends, who else is inside the star's inner circle of trust?\n\nColeen is extremely close to her parents, Colette and Tony, and has even called her mother her 'best friend' in the past.\n\nClose: Coleen is extremely close to her parents, Colette and Tony, and has called her mother her 'best friend' in the past\n\nThe mother-of-four has previously labelled her mum Colette a 'hero' and publicly thanked her for helping out with her children with husband Wayne - Kai, nine, Klay, six, Kit, three, and Cass, 20-months.\n\nThe star also has a strong bond with her two brothers, Joe and Anthony McLoughlin, with Coleen being best friends with Joe's partner Amy Wilkinson for years.\n\nAmy and Joe have son, Bobby, who is Coleen's nephew and is a similar age to her own son, Kit, three.\n\nColeen and Amy have been pictured at several events together over the years, including an Ed Sheeran concert and even Glastonbury.\n\nAs well as her own family, the WAG also has a close bond with Wayne's nearest and dearest with Coleen close pals with his cousin Claire Rooney.\n\nColeen also has some close celebrity pals, including fellow WAGs - Abbey Clancy, Danielle Lloyd and Dawn Ward.\n\nThe trio make up some of the star's 366 followers on her private Instagram account, reserved for her inner circle of trust.\n\nFriends: Coleen pictured with mother Colette and her brother's partner Carley Smith\n\nSiblings: The star also has a strong bond with her two brothers, Joe and Anthony McLoughlin, with Coleen being best friends with Joe's partner Amy Wilkinson and Anthony's girlfriend Carley Smith (pictured together with her children and parents)\n\nThe in-laws!
