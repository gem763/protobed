UCLA (1-4, 1-1) has looked better since the start of Pac-12 play but with the Bruins\u2019 poor record, fan interest is close to hitting rock bottom.\n\nThe game Saturday against Oregon State (1-3, 0-1) could have the lowest attendance since the Bruins moved to the Rose Bowl in 1982. The two smallest crowds have been for games against the Beavers, with the low-water mark being 32,513 in 1992.\n\nTwo of the last three UCLA home crowds have been under 40,000. The Sept. 15 game against Oklahoma drew 52,578 but it was a predominantly Sooners crowd.\n\nKelly said he understands fans\u2019 frustrations but is optimistic the program can show signs of improvement.\n\n\u201cI have faith in these guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s on us to make the corrections and to play better as a football team and to coach better as a coaching staff.\u201d\n\nBoth teams are coming off rough three-point losses last week. UCLA fell at Arizona 20-17 and Oregon State dropped a 30-27 decision to Stanford.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting closer but getting close and winning is another thing in hand,\u201d Oregon State coach Jonathan Smith said. \u201cThere is drastic improvement, especially on the defensive side. Has that turned into wins? No, but we are continuing to work at it.\u201d\n\nOther things to watch as the Bruins and Beavers meet for the first time since 2016:\n\nUCLA QB: Dorian Thompson-Robinson suffered a leg injury during the third quarter last week and is doubtful after not practicing this week. Fellow sophomore Austin Burton would get the start if Thompson-Robinson can\u2019t go.\n\nBurton was 5 of 9 for 48 yards against the Wildcats and led a drive that got the Bruins in range for a potential tying field goal late in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cAustin came in and did a nice job. He can beat you with his arm and legs. He throws a nice catchable football,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cAustin and Dorian have similar traits. They\u2019re not designed runners but if defenses give them the opportunity in man coverage, they can tuck it and run.\u201d\n\nAIRING IT OUT: Oregon State\u2019s Jake Luton has thrown 140 straight passes without being picked off. That ranks fourth nationally and second in the conference.\n\nLuton threw for 338 yards vs. Stanford last week and faces a UCLA defense that is giving up the second-most passing yards nationally (351.8 per game). Luton\u2019s favorite target is Isaiah Hodgins, who has six touchdowns.\n\nKEY PIECE BACK?: Beavers running back Jermar Jefferson is close to being 100% after being hampered the past two games by an ankle injury. Jefferson led Pac-12 freshmen in rushing yards last season.\n\nSenior Artavis Pierce has been able to pick up the slack and is averaging 8.4 yards per carry. Pierce rushed for 141 yards and had a pair of touchdowns last week against Stanford.\n\nSTARTING TO ROLL: UCLA running back Joshua Kelley was bothered by a knee injury the first three games but has gained momentum the past two weeks with games of 90 yards or more. The senior rushed for 127 yards and a touchdown last week at Arizona and is facing an Oregon State run defense that is last in the conference, allowing 180.5 yards per game.\n\nKelley and Demetric Felton will have to carry the load if Thompson-Robinson is ruled out.\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Oregon State linebacker Hamilcar Rashed Jr., who leads the Pac-12 with 7.5 tackles for loss and five sacks. The junior and Arizona\u2019s Jalen Harris are the only players in the Pac-12 with at least one tackle for loss in each game this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chip Kelly's tenure at UCLA has been rough on the field and in the stands.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/ucla_arizona_football_49072_c0-82-1957-1223_s1770x1032.jpg?46d92a1c7e5edb2018d36ac01d0331b1dcc34584", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
