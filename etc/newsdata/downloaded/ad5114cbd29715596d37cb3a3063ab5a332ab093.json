I\u2019ll bring em back after I\u2019m done all my wicked lips stuff if y\u2019all miss em that much,' the Fancy rapper Tweeted in response to a fan.\n\nIggy Azalea, 29, has revealed the real reason why she deleted her entire Instagram feed earlier this week\n\nIn another Tweet, Iggy explained that she was merely preparing to 'start a new era in a week' when she deleted her feed, referring to her upcoming EP Wicked Lips.\n\nIggy - who boasts an impressive 13.3 million followers - removed every single post shared on Instagram earlier this week, and ensured she was following no one.\n\nIt's the second drastic move she's made on social media this year, as back in May she deleted her accounts following a nude photo leak from a magazine shoot.\n\nCreative reasons: 'I archived them, not delete. I\u2019ll bring em back after I\u2019m done all my wicked lips stuff if y\u2019all miss em that much,' the Fancy rapper Tweeted in response to a fan.\n\nHmmm: Iggy- who boasts an impressive 13.3 million followers - removed every single post shared on Instagram earlier this week, and ensured she was following no one\n\nIggy's latest purge came after she unfollowed fellow female rapper Cardi B on Twitter.\n\nThe rumoured 'feud' started after Cardi hinted it was her who made it possible for more than one female rapper to be successful during a chat on Tidal\u2019s Rap Radar podcast.\n\n'I feel like, after me, I\u2019ll say that it\u2019s kinda easier for a lot of these female artists,' she said.\n\n'Like before me, there was no female rapper that was signed to a label - well, you know the ones that had already been established. Nobody was signing them.'\n\nFeuding? Cardi hinted it was her who made it possible for more than one female rapper to be successful during a chat on Tidal\u2019s Rap Radar podcast\n\nAfter receiving major backlash online - including from fans of female rap legend Nicki Minaj - Cardi wrote: 'I\u2019m lying? So you tell me what rappers was giving features to female rappers?\n\n'What label was pushing a female rapper? What TV music show was inviting female rappers. Only 2 female rappers for years and one ain\u2019t last to long ......now you tell me! I wanna see something?'\n\nIt was then when Iggy unfollowed Cardi and liked a Twitter user's comment, which read: 'B***h, you tried it!' The post has since been deleted.", "description": "She left fans shocked after deleting all of her Instagram posts last week, amid rumours of a feud with Cardi B.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Australia Reporter", "Nicole Douglas For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20231098-0-image-a-56_1572137073605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
