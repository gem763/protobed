She can see the hero where others can\u2019t, and if only people could look past the social awkwardness, and the thinly disguised selfishness, and the various nasty businesses, then they would surely realise what heroic qualities truly are.\n\nIndeed, perhaps this knighthood foreshadows how someone who has herself exhibited these characteristics in her own career could go on to a highly successful second act in the political commentary box, or on the board of one of the better arms firms. Perhaps in retirement, that someone too will become the effervescent opposite of her playing self. Or perhaps she will grind out the rest of her remorseless innings pointing at potholes for the local constituency paper, as Mrs May was doing this week.\n\nCalls for Boris Johnson to withdraw Geoffrey Boycott's knighthood Read more\n\nAnyway, a recap of the facts: in 1998, Boycott was convicted by a French court of assaulting his then\u2011girlfriend, a verdict off which he continues to smash soundbites with outrageous abandon. Those who regard no morning as complete if they haven\u2019t lost their shit with Radio 4\u2019s Today programme were certainly given what they wanted on Tuesday, as Boycott was interviewed on the news of his knighthood. \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love,\u201d was his retort to Martha Kearney\u2019s mention that the chief executive of Woman\u2019s Aid had called his knighthood \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d.\n\nNor is there any shortage of \u201ccolourful background\u201d on Boycott\u2019s position on the honours system. Boycott felt his earlier gong, an MBE, had been devalued by those given to the 2005 Ashes-winning side, who went on to a 5-0 series whitewash in Australia two years later. \u201cPeople like me played 100 Test matches to get one, and [scored] 8,000 [runs],\u201d he fretted at the time. \u201cI didn\u2019t play five Test matches and get one. I feel so bad about mine I\u2019m going to tie it round my cat. It doesn\u2019t mean anything any more. It\u2019s a joke.\u201d Yet Boycott felt the prospect of upgrading his cat jewellery was slim. A couple of years ago, he claimed further honours for him had been \u201cturned down twice\u201d, adding that \u201cI\u2019d better black my face\u201d. West Indians, he thought, received them \u201clike confetti\u201d.\n\nSo as every reader of the sports pages already knows, this is what you\u2019re dealing with. You always were. Apart from Boycott\u2019s forthcoming acquisition of an honour that ghastly businessmen mostly pay for, nothing \u2013 to coin a phrase \u2013 has changed. Those who don\u2019t trouble themselves with sport seem to be waking up not just to the news that Boycott has received a knighthood, but that he works for the BBC. Even so, it is not 2005 again.\n\nHis domestic violence conviction is a longstanding matter of record, and frequently written about by many of us. I see I most recently mentioned it at the end of June. But he didn\u2019t honour himself. Of much more immediate concern, then, must be the person who decided to do so, despite the above. We know all about Geoffrey Boycott. What does this knighthood tell us about Theresa May?\n\nWe certainly know May continued to adore her childhood cricketing hero, even after his conviction, as did many who found themselves disappointed by, say, the plodding commentary of Ian Botham. But even accounting for this, to knight him is something different.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nPlenty of people couldn\u2019t believe the domestic violence of Boycs. Was Theresa May one of those? She wouldn\u2019t have been alone. Sports writer Ian Wooldridge described Boycott\u2019s assault charge as \u201ca hiccup in his personal life\u201d, adding that he would \u201cbe happy to appear as a character witness on his behalf in a court case still hanging over his head in France\u201d. It is at least difficult to imagine a column like that being written nowadays (even if the current parliamentary sketchwriter of the Times does appear to think his job is to be character witness for the prime minister). Yet if May didn\u2019t accept the conviction, it is remarkable. She was not otherwise famously soft on law and order, nor given to believing the best of people.\n\nBoycott\u2019s not-out attitude switches ends between Test cricket and Brexit | Marina Hyde Read more\n\nOr did May believe it but not mind? Again, this would not be of a piece with the May worldview, where redemption and second chances were not in ready supply.\n\nPerhaps the most realistic verdict is that she preferred not to think about it, just as she seems to have preferred not to think about the impact of her own egregious acts.\n\nMany of us turn a blind eye to certain aspects of our heroes; May\u2019s ability to overlook such a monumental one as far as Boycott was concerned suggests a deep personal need to do so. Here was a man regarded as socially inept, never mixing with his teammates during his playing years, or his commentary box colleagues thereafter. Here was a man whose guiding principle was a uniquely selfish form of caution allied to a warped yet clearly intense idea of public service. Here was a man who for many was completely unwatchable, and who for all his glaring character flaws never appeared capable of reflection. Here was a man whose brief England captaincy ended in failure and humiliation.\n\nYet here was a man who, despite enduring the slings and arrows of opponents and teammates alike, will nonetheless be regarded as an all-time great, and who will \u2013 especially now \u2013 regard himself as having won. Looked at like that, the question is not \u201chow could Theresa May knight Geoffrey Boycott?\u201d \u2013 but \u201chow could she not?\u201d", "description": "Glacial opener, failed captain, convicted assaulter \u2013 no wonder the former PM has idolised him since childhood", "authors": ["Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14b555dee1ef007ace32f712cb4fd05dddc70a96/48_176_2030_1218/master/2030.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=16fd408c0d0cf84e8c4cfe685282cc85", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
