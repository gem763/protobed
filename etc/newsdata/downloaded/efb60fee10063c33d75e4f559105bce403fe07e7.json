Can this stock be bought low and sold high?\n\nAs the \u201cGreat Rotation\u201d grips the U.S. stock market, more investors are turning to \u201cvalue\u201d stocks, or those that are considered comparatively underpriced or overlooked.\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, while the main U.S. stock indexes SPX, +0.26% DJIA, +0.13% COMP, +0.40% have hovered near all time highs, investors have been selling so-called momentum stocks which have led the market up based on fast growing revenues, earnings or valuations, and buying stocks offering value compared to earnings or book value.\n\nBut the speedy reversal of fortune for value, amid a market increasingly dominated by passively-managed funds, is leading to some unexpected outcomes.\n\nSee also: It\u2019s reflation that\u2019s turning the \u2018Great Rotation,\u2019 these analysts say\n\nAs famed investor Laszlo Birinyi put it in a Tuesday note to clients, \u201cYes, Caterpillar CAT, -0.74% has done well as have the banks but the value index has been led by Apple. Apple a value stock?\u201d\n\nBirinyi was looking at the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF IVE, +0.03% , which has gained over 4.3% since the start of the month. Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.36% makes up 8.14% of that fund\u2019s holdings, he noted.\n\nTim Quast, president of quantitative analytics firm ModernNetworks IR, told MarketWatch, \u201cApple is in 275 ETFs. They range from ultra-short-tech to Sharia to large-cap to covered call to value and growth both.\u201d\n\nYes, Shariah: the Wahed FTSE USA Shariah ETF HLAL, -0.12%, whose holdings can be found here.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a bit jarring to think of a company with a roughly trillion-dollar market cap, one whose devices are in the hands of billions of people literally around the world, as one that investors might not be fully appreciating.\n\nAs Birinyi put it, \u201cSomehow buying Apple while playing defense is hard to compute but we are just reporting not editorializing.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stock-market investors\u2019 appetite for \u2018bond proxies\u2019 is waning", "description": "As markets churn, there\u2019s some unexpected fallout in fund holdings, including classifying Apple, one of the world\u2019s biggest companies, as a \u201cvalue\u201d play.", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB316_aaple__ZG_20190104101412.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
