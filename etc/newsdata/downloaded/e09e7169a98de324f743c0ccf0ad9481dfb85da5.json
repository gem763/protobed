He sends his best wishes to Tennessee and Michigan, both teams that are likely to take big Ls. USA TODAY\n\nFranco Harris found time to talk over the phone in an airport.\n\nHe started with a laugh, saying he can't believe how busy life has become at 69, but in the most positive of ways.\n\nHe continues to push new business ventures, helps with Special Olympics, fundraises and makes countless speeches and celebrity appearances, many related to the NFL's 100th anniversary.\n\nThis weekend, he will be back at Penn State, to the place where he says so much of his life got started. He will soak in the white-out game atmosphere against Michigan and marvel at more than how Beaver Stadium has doubled in size since he played there.\n\nFormer Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris (center) stands with teammates at Heinz Field for a ceremony to honor the team's Hall of Honor inductees.

Pavely, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe NFL Hall of Fame running back will make an appearance with the national championship trophy in the pregame as part of the Amway Coaches Poll trophy tour.\n\n\"The connection and legacy of Penn State is something that will be with me forever. Just being a graduate of Penn State and people you meet across the world. It's a connection that changed my life ...\"\n\nCRYSTAL BALL: Predictions for the second half in college football\n\nREPORT CARD: First-half grades for first-year college football coaches\n\nMIDSEASON AWARDS: Honoring the highs and lows from the first half\n\nHarris never truly faded that far from the spotlight after his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Business ventures kept him visible, such as leading a nutritional bakery company with former Nittany Lion teammate Lydell Mitchell.\n\nHe mostly recently became an investor and partner for a manufacturer of THC-free CBD products derived from organically grown hemp.\n\nHarris was one of the most public supporters of former head coach Joe Paterno after he was fired in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky scandal and, later, when Penn State endured NCAA sanctions.\n\nBut the man certainly has enjoyed a renaissance of popularity in conjunction with the NFL's grand anniversary. He was a star of the popular Super Bowl commercial last winter before his \"Immaculate Reception\" was named the No. 1 play in NFL history.\n\nThat stunning, game-ending, catch-and-run still resonates deeply 47 years later. The Steelers only beat the Oakland Raiders for the first playoff victory in franchise history because Harris picked off a wildly deflected pass just before it hit the turf, then sprinted half the field for a touchdown.\n\nTwo years later, the Steelers won the first of four Super Bowls.\n\nHISTORIC PLAY: 'Immaculate Reception' named greatest play in NFL history\n\n'Go to the ball!'\n\nHarris said he feels honored that the play still sends a message: \"No matter how hopeless something appears ... you don\u2019t ever give up. Anything can happen.\"\n\nHe was a rookie back then, just finished with college a couple of hours to the East.\n\nHe says the Immaculate Reception never would have happened if not for Penn State. Paterno's words were ingrained in him, like it or not.\n\n\"Go to the ball! Go to the ball!\"\n\n\"I know it\u2019s hard to believe that was in my head,\" Harris said this week. \"That's one thing that I did when I first went to practice with the Steelers. When you hear things like that as a (college) player it kind of just goes through you. ... But when I got to the next level it was, 'What are the things I need to do now that will make me better, than can make a difference?'\"\n\nPaterno's lesson rose up in him.\n\n\"I guess that one came at the right time.\"\n\n'Strive to be great'\n\nHarris still navigates the attention from one play so long ago. \"It's hard to wrap my head around it. How do you grasp when you\u2019re part of the number one play ... that's pretty enormous.\n\n\"I think, 'You know what, Franco, enjoy it.' This is for all of us to enjoy. And if we can do some good things with it and raise money for good causes, that\u2019s even more wonderful.\"\n\nHe also feels fortunate to be part of the trophy tour stop at Penn State. The Nittany Lions have not won the title since 1986 and have missed out in other years despite undefeated teams.\n\nThe last Penn State team to go undefeated was 25 years ago with a legendary offense led by quarterback Kerry Collins. Harris was a member of the 1969 team that finished 11-0 but was No. 3, in part, because of a presidential proclamation. Richard Nixon urged that the winner of the Texas and Arkansas game be declared national champs.\n\nEven more so, the trophy is a symbol for never giving up to achieve ultimate goals, Harris said. He feels it could find a more permanent place at his alma mater soon, praising head coach James Franklin for driving Penn State to \"the next level.\"\n\nIt's an important symbol, he said, \"to show people how to strive to be great.\"", "description": "Franco Harris is almost 50 years removed from Penn State and his Immaculate Reception.
