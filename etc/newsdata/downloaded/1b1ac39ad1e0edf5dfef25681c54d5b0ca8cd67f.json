But friends insisted he would have had no \u00adknowledge he was carrying a human cargo of tragedy.\n\nIt is feared they came to Britain with help from the Snakeheads, notorious people-smugglers with links to \u00adruthless Triad gangsters in China.\n\nThey are said to tout the streets for victims, enticing them with the promise of a better life before charging thousands of pounds to take treacherous trips to the West in a \u201cfly-drive\u201d service costing \u00a330,000.\n\nThey are usually flown from the Fujian region of China to Europe, all expenses paid, then placed in accommodation. They are then placed in goods lorries and driven in darkness, without food, ventilation, water or toilet facilities.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nA source, who cannot be \u00adidentified for her own safety, said: \u201cThis is not a crime in Chinese culture, this is an opportunity. It is an agreement between the Snakeheads and their customers. They are willing, they feel no shame in breaking the law.\n\n\u201cThere is a pride that they get out of Fujian and have a chance of a good life with good money in places like Northern Ireland, England, Scotland where there are good benefits.\n\n\"Yes the journey is difficult, it is uncomfortable and it is frightening, but the gamble is normally worth it. The chances of a good life is worth the risk. In this case it didn\u2019t work. Something went wrong but the Snakeheads will just go again.\n\n\u201cThere will be no tears. In Fujian there is little employment, little money or opportunity, so we get it elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThese customers get paid as little as \u00a3200 a month in China and live in horrible conditions. In the UK, they can get \u00a32,000 a month in a job with no responsibilities, get benefits, get married and live a decent life.\n\n\u201cThese people who died in this container had hopes of a future in a good country. Another group will be waiting for their chance to get on a lorry now somewhere in Europe.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cThis will not put them off. The plan normally works. The Snakeheads have contacts everywhere. They are \u00adpractical people, not emotional. They have lost \u00a31.2million in \u00adearnings in this. So they will go again.\u201d\n\nThe source claimed migrants who make it to the West start paying back the Snakeheads the moment they get a job, over three years. If they cannot pay, the gangs will put pressure on their families back in China to hand over the cash.\n\nThe source spoke as police began moving the bodies of the migrants from the lorry to a mortuary.\n\nOfficers are trying to find out if driver Robinson, from \u00adPortadown, Co Armagh, knew the 39 were in the trailer being pulled by his Scania truck.\n\nHis parents, Mark, 50, and Nichola, are believed to have flown from Northern Ireland to support their son in England. Officers searched their modern semi-detached home in the nearby village of Laurelvale.\n\nThey also raided a \u00a3300,000 home in nearby Markethill, where it is believed the suspect lives with his pregnant girlfriend. A third property in the area was also searched.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA friend of Robinson said: \u201cI\u2019ve known Mo for years. He\u2019s the best in the world and would give you the shirt off his back. He\u2019s not the kind of man that would do this. He would have had no notion what was in that trailer.\u201d\n\nAnother claimed Robinson opened the container to collect \u00adpaperwork. The friend added: \u201cHe was \u00adabsolutely horrified.\u201d\n\nA Bulgarian national was \u00adquestioned by police about his alleged links to the truck which is reportedly licensed there to a firm run by an Irish woman. But the person authorities claimed owned it said last night: \u201cWe sold it 13 months ago.\u201d\n\nThe refrigerated trailer came to the UK via Zeebrugge in Belgium. It is still unclear where it started its journey.\n\nIt is owned by Global Trailer Rentals Ltd, which is based in Dublin. The firm said it was \u201centirely unaware the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been\u201d.\n\nSocial Services have taken around six \u201cunaccompanied children\u201d, thought to be from Africa, into care after they were found in the Belfast harbour area, it has emerged.\n\nDover horror exposed mob's sickening trade\n\nNotorious gangs based in Rotterdam\u2019s Chinatown have controlled smuggling routes between Europe and the UK for decades.\n\nThey are the prime suspects in trafficking the tragic Chinese migrants found dead inside the refrigerated unit on Wednesday.\n\nBritish detectives are now desperately trying to find out how the human cargo made the 6,000 mile journey from their homeland.\n\nThe tragedy echoes the UK\u2019s worst migrant mass-killing, when 58 Chinese nationals were found dead in a lorry at Dover.\n\nAuthorities made the horrendous discovery in 2000 after stopping a Dutch truck that had arrived from Zeebrugge.\n\nThe victims had each agreed to pay \u00a320,000 to Chinese \u2018snakehead\u2019 gangs to be smuggled into the UK.\n\nAll of the migrants - 54 men and four women - came from villages in rural China\u2019s eastern Fujian province.\n\nThe impoverished coastal region is the hub of human smuggling operations and a hotbed of \u2018snakehead\u2019 activity.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nFamilies pay for their sons and daughters to be trafficked to the West so they can earn money to send back home.\n\nJing Ping Chen - also known as \u2018Little Sister Ping\u2019 or \u2018Godmother of the Snakeheads\u2019 - was linked in a Dutch court to the Dover plot.\n\nOriginally from Fujian province, in the late 1990s and early 2000s she was among the most prolific traffickers of human cargo in Europe.\n\nShe was notorious in Rotterdam\u2019s Westkruisad Chinatown and suspected of being the main organiser of the Dover shipment.\n\nHer boyfriend at the time was a powerful Triad based in the city and they had a holiday home in the Greek islands.\n\nShe was also said to have strong connections among Communist Party officials in Fujian.\n\nDutch investigators said the 5ft 1ins-tall smuggler went into hiding within hours of the deaths at Dover.\n\nShe was jailed for three years in 2003 after being accused of smuggling up to 175,000 - earning around \u00a315m.\n\n(Image: VICKIE FLORES/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe judge said she was the \u201cleader of a group smuggling human beings\u201d but cleared her of any involvement in the Dover case.\n\nChen, now 53, was released in 2005. Her current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nThe \u2018snakehead\u2019 smuggling operations had remained shrouded in secrecy for decades until the Dover lorry deaths.\n\nCrucially two migrants survived the tragedy and gave investigators a chilling insight into how they were trafficked.\n\nSu Di Ke, 20, and Ke Shi Guang, 22, said their families in China agreed to pay gangsters \u00a320,000 so they could get to the UK.\n\nThey handed over \u00a3700 initially - with the remaining \u00a319,300 due once they arrived in Britain.\n\nBefore leaving Fujian along with other migrants they were given a code number identifying which gang \u2018owned\u2019 them.\n\nThey had been promised they would be flown directly into the UK, where they could claim asylum.\n\nBut instead they were flown Belgrade, Serbia, on legal Chinese documents before having their passports taken off them.\n\nThey were handed fake South Korean documents before being taken into Hungary and smuggled through Austria and France to the Netherlands.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThere they were housed in a safe house in Rotterdam and passed on to Turkish mafia middlemen who arranged the crossing.\n\nFinally in a warehouse in Waalhaven they were put into the lorry and sent on their final journey to the UK.\n\nMost victims were in several layers of clothing because they were only allowed to bring what they were wearing.\n\nDuring the trial of Dutch trucker Perry Wacker, the two survivors gave harrowing about their hellish crossing.\n\nThey said the trailer\u2019s air vent was initially tied open and they were given four buckets of water for the journey.\n\nBut Wacker closed it before he left Belgium to avoid the migrants being spotted and never checked on his human cargo.\n\nThey were trapped inside the air tight container for more than nine hours on one of the hottest days of the year.\n\nDuring the six-hour crossing Wacker left his lorry to enjoy a meal of roast lamb and rice, with shrimp salad, and watch two films.\n\nMeanwhile the migrants began banging frantically on the inside of the container with their shoes as their air supply ran out.\n\n\u201cPeople began to panic because the window was shut and there was no air,\u201d said Su Di Ke.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cSome people removed tomatoes and wanted to kick open the doors. There was a lot of shouting and screaming, but no-one came.\u201d\n\nFinally they held hands and ate tomatoes because in China it is believed you should not die on an empty stomach.\n\nSu Di Ke and Ke Shi Guang only survived because they were last to be loaded onto the truck and were sat near the doors.\n\nPolice found the telephone number of the same UK-based Chinese translator, Ying Guo, on the bodies of 27 victims.\n\nAfter recovering from the ordeal, the survivors confirmed \u2018snakeheads\u2019 were behind the plot.\n\n\u201cI didn't have a good life at home and the snakehead told me there would be no risk,\u201d said Su Di Ke.\n\n\u201cWe want to come to Britain because you can earn good money. Life is good there.\u201d\n\nThe survivors had been told to ring Guo, known as Jenny, once they arrived in Britain so she could help them claim asylum.\n\n\u201cThe snakeheads asked us to write her number down and, if we were arrested by police, to call her,\u201d said Su Di Ke.\n\nKe Shi Guang added: \u201cThe snakeheads at home cheated us. They said they would be buying the tickets and we would be travelling by air.\u201d\n\nWacker, 33, from Rotterdam, was jailed for 14 years in 2001 and quietly released from prison in 2010.\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nGuo, from Waltham Forest, received a six-year jail term for her role in the tragedy and still lives in the UK.\n\nNine other members of the gang, including Turkish gangster Gurbel Ozcan, were jailed in Holland for their part in the tragedy.\n\nPolice struggled to identify the bodies because the migrants were either carrying fake documents or none at all.\n\nIn desperation they took photos of the corpses, which were put on display in local town halls in Fujian.\n\nSoon families came forward and British detectives flew to China to carry out DNA tests - eventually identifying all 58 victims.\n\nThey also spoke to relatives of the dead, who pointed the finger of blame at \u2018snakeheads\u2019.\n\nInvestigators discovered the migrants had arrived in Rotterdam from various destinations and routes.\n\nSome were driven from Serbia through Europe in the back of vans, others flown to Paris and then taken by train to Belgium.\n\nAlleged \u2018snakehead\u2019 ringleader Chen Xiaokong was arrested in Fujian in 2001 but it is unclear whether he ever faced justice.", "description": "Evil people-smuggling thugs from China are feared to be behind the tragedy at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex", "authors": ["Louie Smith", "Tom Pettifor", "Jilly Beattie", "Amy-Clare Martin", "Martin Fricker", "Paul Byrne", "Image", "Reuters", "Pa", "Vickie Flores Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20712678.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bodies-found-in-lorry-container.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
