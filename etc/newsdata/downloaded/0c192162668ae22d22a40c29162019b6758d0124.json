While making our way through the floors we got to the thermal imaging camera room.\n\n\u2018As all families do, we entered and started to wave our arms and look at the images created.\n\n\u2018While doing this I noticed a heat patch coming from my left breast. We thought it was odd and having looked at everyone else they didn\u2019t have the same.\u2019\n\nMs Gill said she took a photo of her map and carried on enjoying the attractions.\n\nIt was only back at home a few days later that she saw it again while flicking through the holiday snaps.\n\nMs Gill decided to Google what the hot spot might mean, only to be faced with \u2018a lot of articles about breast cancer and thermal imaging cameras\u2019.\n\n\u2018I made an appointment with the doctor and as it turns out I do have breast cancer, thankfully really early stages,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018I have now had two surgeries and have one to go to prevent it from spreading.\n\n\u2018I just wanted to say thank you; without that camera I would never have known. I know it\u2019s not the intention of the camera but for me it really was a life-changing visit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I cannot tell you enough about how my visit to the Camera Obscura changed my life.\u2019\n\nShe thanked the museum for helping to make the \u2018life-changing\u2019 diagnosis (Picture: Google Maps)\n\nAndrew Johnson, general manager of Camera Obscura and World of Illusions, said: \u2018We did not realise that our Thermal Camera had the potential to detect life-changing symptoms in this way.\n\n\u2018We were really moved when Bal contacted us to share her story as breast cancer is very close to home for me and a number of our team.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s amazing that Bal noticed the difference in the image and crucially acted on it promptly.\n\n\u2018We wish her all the best with her recovery and hope to meet her and her family in the future.\u2019\n\nThermography, also called thermal imaging, is a tool used by breast cancer specialists and uses a special camera to measure the temperature of the skin on the breast\u2019s surface.", "description": "Bal Gill, 41, was visiting Camera Obscura and World of Illusions in Edinburgh during a family holiday in May.", "authors": ["Sam Corbishley"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91207682_1571756919.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
