These changes will come into effect on 1 January 2020.\n\nUnder Armour wasn't always the trouble-stricken brand that it is today \u2014 it once seemed poised to overtake the sportswear market in what seemed like a true Cinderella story.\n\nFrom its rise to a once-$15 billion athletic-apparel empire and its eventual slow decline, here is the complete story of Under Armour so far.", "description": "Kevin Plank stepped down after 23 years as CEO of Under Armour on Tuesday.
