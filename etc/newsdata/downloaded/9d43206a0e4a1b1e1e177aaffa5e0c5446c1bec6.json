The S&P 500 fell 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1%.\n\nData Monday heightened investors' worries about the health of the global economy. Factory orders in Germany slipped more than expected in August, while confidence among eurozone investors fell to the lowest level in six years.\n\nThe reports, coming days after a gauge of U.S. factory activity slipped to the lowest level in a decade, added to signs that economic growth is softening around the world.\n\nWhile U.S. stocks remain up double-digit percentages for the year, helped by investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will keep lowering interest rates, some analysts warn further deterioration in economic data could chip away at the rally.\n\nAmong individual stocks, General Motors fell 0.2% after negotiations between the firm and the United Auto Workers union broke down over the weekend.\n\nPayPal shares fell 1.1% after it said it was withdrawing from the group of companies Facebook assembled to launch a global cryptocurrrency-based payments network.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.7%, with gains for health-care stocks and food and beverage companies offsetting losses among auto makers.\n\nShares of auto-parts maker Continental AG were among the biggest decliners in the region Monday, falling 1.1%. The company last month confirmed it would close production plants in several countries. Its competitor, Michelin, also said in September it would shut a factory in Germany.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade row has weighed on Germany's manufacturing and export-heavy economy throughout the year.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to resume trade discussions with U.S. counterparts later this week.\n\nAny expectations for a broad trade deal between China and the U.S. had been misguided, said Geoffrey Yu, head of the U.K. investment office at the wealth-management arm of UBS. \"I'm surprised expectations were that high in the first place. It was clear that China wanted to separate the tech side of things out and focus on the tariff side of things alone,\" Mr. Yu said.\n\nMarkets have had their hopes pared back, and as a result, even a partial deal might be enough \"to help keep things on track,\" he said. Investors would be watching the U.S. consumer, and the agricultural sector in particular, for a positive response to any reduction in trade hostilities, Mr. Yu said.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.2%, while South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.1%. Markets in Hong Kong and mainland China remained shut for a national holiday.\n\nLee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, said there had been a number of reports that China may not be as willing to compromise as much as the Trump administration hopes.\n\n\"The U.S. would like a trade deal with China, a wide-ranging deal, but those demands look like they're unlikely to be accepted by China. Things like intellectual property rights and other structural issues like state subsidies look unlikely to be resolved,\" he said. \"China may buy more agricultural goods but it's unclear whether or not that partial agreement will be a big enough win for the U.S.\"\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 07, 2019 13:48 ET (17:48 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
