ChromaWay CEO Henrik Hjelte said:\n\n\u201cOur collaboration with the IDB provides the opportunity for partner countries to take advantage of maturing distributed ledger technologies that have been developed and used in other projects. We are especially excited to deploy these solutions in societies where secure land registration systems can have such a positive social and economic impact.\u201d\n\nThe IADB, which is the largest source of development financing in Latin America, hopes that the project, which is to launch next month, can give insights into how blockchain technology can contribute to solving some of the problems of land administration in South America.\n\nBlockchain records ownership rights\n\nGovernments of different countries around the globe are increasingly participating in or encouraging the creation of blockchain-based land registries.\n\nMost recently, the Department of Economic Development of Dubai announced its transition to a blockchain-based platform for the single enterprise market. The new system will purportedly make doing business in Dubai more convenient.\n\nThe use of blockchain to permanently record ownership rights for real estate and business has been ongoing since 2016. Interest in the technology continues to grow as the process excludes intermediaries that collect commissions in the process of, for example, conducting real estate transactions. It can also lower the risk of fraud, prevent data forgery and simplify the process of checking real estate objects or business debts before deals take place.", "description": "The IADB is piloting three projects to see if blockchain technology can solve some of the most urgent problems of land administration in South America", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kYzc4ZjU4Zjg5YjQ2OTA4YTc0MmE0ZjQzMTM5MjU0YS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
