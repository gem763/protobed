Six per day. Two thousand per year. By the time we return from [lunch] today, one more younger person can be expected to have become a resident in an aged care facility,\u201d Rozen told the hearing.\n\nNursing homes are supposed to be the last resort for young people, but that\u2019s not the case in practice.\n\nI have to treat the patients like objects: The harsh reality of working in dementia care | Anonymous Read more\n\nLisa Corcoran, 43, who has an acquired brain injury, gave evidence to the hearing with the help of a speech pathologist. She has been living in a nursing home for six years and said she was given no choice in the matter when she was discharged from hospital.\n\n\u201cThe staff just bundled up my clothing and moved me \u2013 they didn\u2019t even tell me where I was going,\u201d she said.\n\nHer number one life goal was to \u201cget the fuck out of the nursing home. Up until recently every day I felt like killing myself.\u201d\n\nShe characterised the time as a \u201cnightmare\u201d and lamented the indignity of having to fight for a shower every two days rather than once a week. She is also upset about not getting a choice about what clothes she wears each day.\n\nCorcoran said it was traumatic to see people dying all around her and recently there had been six deaths in a fortnight.\n\n\u201cI saw one body being moved. I saw his head in a red bag. This was at 12pm when everyone was eating lunch,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOne day my room was getting painted and I had to go out of my room and into the common area. I remember seeing all the other residents just sitting as if they were waiting to die. You could hear a pin drop.\u201d\n\nCorcoran said feels isolated, unsupported by staff and spends the majority of her time alone in her room because she struggles to connect with the other residents. Her only visitor is her brother.\n\nShe detailed the humiliation of having an elderly man with dementia walk into her bathroom when she was having a shower. Another time staff forgot they had left her in the sun and she was severely burnt.\n\nCorcoran is waiting to move into new accommodation under the National Disability Insurance Scheme by the end of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s not getting old that people fear, it\u2019s getting old and lonely and disconnected | Ranjana Srivastava Read more\n\nMeanwhile, Catherine Roche from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches detailed the experience of how her late husband Michael\u2019s stroke at the age of 56 had forced him into the aged care system because of a shortage of places in rehabilitation units.\n\n\u201cEverything I looked into ended up being a dead end,\u201d she said.\n\nRoche slammed the inadequate rehabilitation therapy, lack of socialisation and age-appropriate leisure activities on offer for her husband at the nursing home, which caused him to emotionally withdraw.\n\nShe was forced to pay for private physiotherapy sessions three times a week at a cost of $2,000 per month.\n\n\u201cAlthough Michael had physical disabilities and his speech was compromised, his cognition was still quite good. I could communicate with Michael verbally because I understood his speech patterns,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI believe that staff at the residential aged care facility treated him as if he had dementia because they did not understand what he was saying.\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t go on outings because two staff members were required to help move him because he was 1.9m tall. He died at age 59, a couple of months after a fall at the nursing home.\n\nRoche said younger people with disabilities should be in environments with specially trained staff and not relegated to aged care.\n\n\u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467.", "description": "Royal commission hears of plight of young Australians stuck in aged care", "authors": ["Lisa Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/769aca71f7541702b18ccc5b543eb858b6e64b9c/0_135_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=887928b708e6fae1ea321fee0ac93f3b", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
