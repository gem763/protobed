Photo: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Democratic frontrunner cannot speak in complete sentences when he is feeling tired or defensive. And 90 minutes of debate is enough to make him tired. And a reference to something that he said about race in the 1970s is enough to make him defensive.\n\nThese were my three main takeaways from the Democratic Party\u2019s third presidential primary debate in Houston on Thursday. And they\u2019ve left me rather apprehensive about the prospect of the Democrats sending Joe Biden into battle against Donald Trump next year. A three-hour debate can be tiring. But a 14-month campaign would seem considerably more so. If Biden can\u2019t keep his talking points straight for an entire evening, what shape will he be in after running the gauntlet between today and his televised showdowns with the president next fall? And if a pointed question from an ABC News anchor can reduce him to spasms of anxious blather, how well will he hold up when Trump comes after his family?\n\nBut then, I may just be a biased coastal elite who doesn\u2019t get it. Maybe my perception is so distorted by infatuation with unelectable socialists that I have been hallucinating a senescent old codger where a spry elder statesmen actually stands. After all, I thought Biden manifestly disqualified himself at the first debate, when each of his canned lines tumbled out his mouth in haphazard fashion, forming befuddling dada sentiments like Biden\u2019s promise to help America\u2019s poor by \u201creplacing them with the dignity they once had.\u201d At the second debate, I thought I saw the former vice president tell Americans who shared his vision for the country to \u201cgo to\u201d his first name and then five random numbers.\n\nBut voters ostensibly saw something different. Because nothing that befell Biden\u2019s campaign at the first two debates \u2014 nor before or after \u2014 has prevented him from retaining a healthy lead in Democratic primary polls, or the strongest numbers of any Democrat against Trump in hypothetical general election surveys.\n\nSo maybe I just can\u2019t see straight on this subject. To my eyes, the following exchange between Biden and ABC News\u2019s Linsey Davis on the question of our collective responsibility for slavery reads like dialogue from an obscure Beckett play \u2014 but to an objective observer, perhaps this reads as a thoughtful, cogent answer from a man manifestly equipped to be the next president of the United States:\n\nLinsey Davis: Mr. Vice President, I want to talk to you about inequality in schools and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter \u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\u201d You said that some 40 years ago, but as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\n\nJoe Biden: Well, they have to deal with the\u2026 Look, there is institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Redlining, banks, making sure that we are in a position where \u2014 Look, we talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title 1 schools, triple the amount of money we spend from $15 to $45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise to the equal of\u2026 A raise of getting out of the $60,000 level.\n\nNumber two, make sure that we bring in to the help with the stud\u2014the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home, we need\u2026 We have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It\u2019s crazy. The teachers are required\u2014I\u2019m married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them.\n\nMake sure that every single child does, in fact, have three, four, and five-year-olds go to school. School! Not daycare, school. We bring social workers into homes of parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not want they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t know want\u2014 They don\u2019t know what quite what to do. Play the radio. Make sure the television\u2014excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night. The phone\u2014make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school\u2014er, a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\n\nDavis: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\nBiden: No, I\u2019m going to go like the rest of them do, twice over, okay? Because here\u2019s the deal. The deal is that we\u2019ve got this a little backwards. And by the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro. I\u2019ve confronted Maduro. Number two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America. I\u2019m the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries, in fact, change their system so people don\u2019t have to chance to leave. You\u2019re all acting like we just discovered this yesterday! Thank you very much.\n\nIn all earnestness, I do think Donald Trump is an unusually weak incumbent. And it\u2019s quite plausible to me that in our modern, polarized era, campaigns just don\u2019t matter very much. So, maybe now that Democrats understand Trump really can win the presidency, they will mobilize behind any standard-bearer, no matter how bizarre his or her syntax. Meanwhile, low-information swing voters may never tune into the debates; or if they do, they may not take any exception to Biden\u2019s stumbles. His aura of moderation, personal familiarity, and \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d message may be more appealing to such Americans than his ineloquence is off-putting.\n\nBut that strikes me as a needlessly risky bet to make, given the party\u2019s myriad other options. Polling continues to indicate that, contrary to conventional pundit wisdom, Bernie Sanders is a formidable general election candidate. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s favorability has steadily increased throughout the duration of her campaign, as has her standing against Trump in the polls. But if you are more moderate in your ideological sympathies, or nervous about nominating someone \u201ctoo progressive,\u201d there are plenty of sharper centrists you can back. Cory Booker is a gifted orator. Amy Klobuchar is good at winning soft Republican voters in the Midwest. Beto O\u2019Rourke is quite tall.\n\nBefore Thursday, none of Biden\u2019s ideologically sympathetic competitors had dared to explicitly sell themselves as a more mentally \u201cwith it\u201d alternative to Uncle Joe. But after Juli\u00e1n Castro (clumsily) went there during the debate, Booker embraced the \u201cmany people are saying Joe Biden\u2019s lost few steps\u201d line of attack.\n\nFuller Booker exchange on CNN talking Castro-Biden pic.twitter.com/jWFgX4TMHh \u2014 Tal Kopan (@TalKopan) September 13, 2019\n\nIf Biden does fade over the course of the campaign in a manner analogous to the way he\u2019s been fading over the course of each debate, then I think Booker\u2019s argument should prove potent. But that might just be because I\u2019m an out of touch, \u201cwoke millennial.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
