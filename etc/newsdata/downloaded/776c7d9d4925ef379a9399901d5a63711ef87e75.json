Now Democrats want to impeach the conservative Supreme Court justice over a new sexual misconduct allegation in the New York Times so shady, even the newspaper doesn\u2019t seem to believe in it.\n\nThis fresh smear is buried in the 11th paragraph of a story written by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their upcoming book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nThey name their alleged witness to the alleged incident as Max Stier, a Washington lawyer and former Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s, described as a \u201crespected thought leader on federal government management,\u201d but who also appears to be the same Max Stier who was on then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s legal team during the Lewinsky scandal in 1998, when he worked at the law firm Williams & Connolly.\n\nStier allegedly claims that he \u201csaw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a \u2026 drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student\u201d when Kavanaugh was a freshman at Yale.\n\nThe Times story claims Stier \u201cnotified senators and the FBI about this account but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. (We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.)\u201d\n\nWhat Pogrebin and Kelly left out of their story, yet reported in their book, is that the alleged victim doesn\u2019t remember the incident and refuses to talk about it. That\u2019s journalistic malpractice.\n\nSo no corroboration, no evidence, no victim and no witness (only hearsay of one), but the \u201cpaper of record\u201d is perfectly fine with defaming Kavanaugh all over again.\n\nBy the way, in the book, the authors gratuitously name the woman, including a new surname she uses, even though she doesn\u2019t want to talk \u2014 and the woman\u2019s friends the reporters did speak to say she doesn\u2019t remember anything. Why shame her? Because she refuses to back up the reporters\u2019 agenda?\n\nThe Times reporters claim their fresh allegation about Kavanaugh \u201cechoes\u201d previously uncorroborated 35-year-old claims by another Yale classmate, Deborah Ramirez.\n\nYet Ramirez admitted to The New Yorker, which broke the story last year, that her memory was hazy because she had been drinking heavily during another dorm party at which Kavanaugh allegedly \u201cthrust his penis in her face and caused her to touch it without her consent.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t even certain it was Kavanaugh when first contacted by the magazine but, after \u201csix days of carefully assessing her memories,\u201d lo and behold, she delivered.\n\nThere was never any evidence that what Ramirez said was true, and the Times reporters have not found any new corroboration of her story.\n\nIn fact, they quote another Yale classmate, Ken Appold, as saying that none of the people Ramirez claimed were in the room at the time of the alleged incident had any recollection of it.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop the authors from insinuating an FBI coverup. In their book, they claim \u201cRamirez\u2019s legal team gave the FBI a list of at least 25 individuals who may have had corroborating evidence.\u201d\n\nThe authors don\u2019t name these potential witnesses but complain that the FBI failed to interview any of them. Did the reporters reach any of these people? It\u2019s hard to believe that some, if not all, of the 25 were reached by the media in the scrum to destroy Kavanaugh. Yet there\u2019s been not one direct witness to the Ramirez incident who has come forward.\n\nThe Times\u2019 story is a farrago of innuendo and guilt by word association, and it\u2019s probably safe to assume the same of the book, which will be published Tuesday.\n\nA surefire \u201ctell\u201d that the newspaper doesn\u2019t back its own story is that it buried the bombshell allegation halfway down, on Page 2 of the Sunday Review section with the anodyne headline: \u201cBrett Kavaugh Fit in. She Did Not.\u201d\n\nThere is no tracer to the story in the news pages. It just sits there, buried under piles of newsprint, like an unexploded little bomb for others to detonate.\n\nFurther evidence the newspaper didn\u2019t take its own reporting seriously was a tweet, later deleted, that it used to promote the story on the official @nyt\u00adopinion account, which tastelessly made light of the alleged incident: \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun \u2026\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the Times\u2019 idea of \u201charmless fun,\u201d it has a screw loose in its moral compass.\n\nThe conclusion you can draw from all this is that the Times didn\u2019t back its own reporting.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t matter to unscrupulous Democrats, who fell over themselves yesterday to press the red button for political advantage.\n\nKamala Harris, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Elizabeth Warren were first out of the blocks calling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\nDespite their umbrage, the story provided no new credible allegation against Kavanaugh, nor did it make former allegations, such as Ramirez\u2019s, any more credible. It\u2019s just more \u201cmay remember\u201d and \u201cheard it from someone two weeks later\u201d wrapped up in hyperbole aimed at one thing \u2014 trying to undermine a Supreme Court justice they don\u2019t like.\n\nIt was a witch hunt then, it\u2019s a witch hunt now.\n\nPloys and girls\n\nWhat is with the weaponization of little girls? In case you haven\u2019t noticed, the face of the Climate Armageddon movement is female, fierce and barely pubescent.\n\nThink Greta Thunberg, the diminutive 16-year-old Swedish savant who has sailed into town to address the United Nations and lead this Friday\u2019s \u201cclimate strike\u201d for youngsters to skip school with the blessing of the New York City Department of Education.\n\nOr think 14-year-old Alexandria Villasenor, who has been leaving her parents\u2019 Upper West Side abode each Friday for her own personal climate strike on a bench outside the UN.\n\nThink 15-year-old Isra Hirsi, the daughter of Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nCome to think of it, even Squad member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tries to emulate the teenage vibe with her girly voice and rising intonations, something most 29-year-olds have left behind long ago.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand has the same sort of girly affectation at the ripe old age of 52.\n\nMaybe the idea that the world is going to end in 11 years if we don\u2019t stop using fossil fuels is so ridiculous that you have to pretend to be a child to believe it.\n\nCandy vapes? You must be kid-ding\n\nDon\u2019t listen to the vaping lobbyists. There\u2019s only one reason for candy-flavored vaping products \u2014 and that is to hook children on nicotine.\n\nWhoever sat around the boardroom table of Big Vape and dreamed up cotton candy and bubble gum flavors deserves the same place in hell as the purveyors of marijuana gummy bears.", "description": "This fresh smear is buried in the 11th paragraph of a story written by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their upcoming book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d", "authors": ["Miranda Devine", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/brett-kavanaugh.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
