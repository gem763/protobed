However, her comments on fellow contestants Rachael Arahill and Vakoo Kauapirura\u2019s same-sex relationship are a big ol\u2019 cup of piping hot tea.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it could be a bit of gay-baiting and it doesn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d the 24-year-old said.\n\nFor context for all of you non-diehard Bachie fans, Rachel and Vakoo admitted they had pursued a romantic relationship after both copping the boot from Matt in last season\u2019s Bachie. They were photographed kissing in Sydney, and seem to be absolutely smitten.\n\nHowever, fellow contestant Abbie shared her opinions on the matter, and frankly called bullshit on the whole thing.\n\n\u201cI question the validity of that. Yeah, I don\u2019t think that is legit, as far as I know,\u201d she said.\n\nAbbie didn\u2019t exactly tiptoe around the question either, she slammed the pair for \u201cqueerbaiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is just queerbaiting. It illegitimizes same-sex relationships that do come out of The Bachelor. It makes me feel a bit icky,\u201d Abbie told Outspoken. \u201cIt could be legit, they haven\u2019t told me it\u2019s not. As far as I\u2019m aware, I don\u2019t think it is.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m not about to accuse Vakoo or Rachael of faking a same-sex relationship for clout. In their defence, reality shows like The Bachelor are set up to encourage chemistry, so the idea of the two ex-contestants developing some of their own isn\u2019t exactly out of the question. But fellow contestant Abbie is not buying it.\n\nHowever, Rachael has clapped back at Abbie\u2019s comments in a statement to Daily Mail on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t told her its legit because we don\u2019t speak to her,\u201d said Rachael. \u201cI have her blocked\u2026 she\u2019s the last person I would want to hear from that was part of the show. I hope she doesn\u2019t feel the need to comment on my life again.\u201d\n\nAlthough Rachael didn\u2019t exactly give a definitive \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer, she raises the valid point that past contestants don\u2019t necessarily keep in contact.\n\nVakoo also voiced her opinions on Instagram, sharing the following story on Saturday.\n\nRachael and Vakoo haven\u2019t shared an Instagram photo together since Rachael\u2019s birthday earlier this month. But who knows? Maybe they\u2019re just moving on with their regular lives and don\u2019t have time for daily boozy lunch dates and PDA.\n\nDuring the time Vakoo, Rachael and Abbie shared the mansion, they were all gunning for Matt\u2019s heart. Additionally, the two girls left the mansion pretty early in the season, so they really didn\u2019t get all that much time for Abbie to get to know them well enough to publicly question the validity of their relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s been exactly a month since we saw the final episode of Matt Agnew\u2019s Bachie season, and who knows how long ago the actual filming wrapped up, but it appears some of the contestants\u2019 beef is still very real.", "description": "Bachie runner-up Abbie Chatfield has publicly questioned the legitimacy of former contestants Rachael Arahill and Vakoo Kauapirura's relationship.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-19-at-4.56.16-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
