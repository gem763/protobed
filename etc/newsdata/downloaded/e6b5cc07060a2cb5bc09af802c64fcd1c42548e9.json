France has become a lineup dogged by nerves, lacking fitness and composure, and repeatedly cracking under pressure late in games. And perhaps still mentally scarred by the 62-13 hammering by New Zealand at the last World Cup.\n\nIt makes for grim reading that France, a three-time Rugby World Cup finalist, has not placed higher than third in the past eight Six Nations tournaments. The French are in a tough pool in Japan along with England, Argentina, Tonga and the United States, and only two teams from each group can progress to the quarterfinals.\n\nCoaches have come and gone since France pushed the All Blacks hard in the 2011 final, losing by one point under the maverick yet effective leadership of Marc Lievremont. Philippe Saint-Andre\u2019s chopping-and-changing didn\u2019t work; Guy Noves stuck to old methods but could not replicate his resounding club success at Toulouse.\n\nThe situation deteriorated under Jacques Brunel, with France hitting new lows: a home draw against Japan, a home loss to Fiji and a crushing 44-8 defeat away to England. Those were matches littered with mistakes by the French, a predictable running game, a lack of physical impact, staggering lapses in concentration, players critical of management.\n\nThe stubborn Brunel has appeared to be out of his depth against better-coached teams. Something had to give, but rather than firing Brunel - as many fans demanded - French Rugby Federation president Bernard Laporte made a more diplomatic move in appointing Fabien Galthi\u00e9 as Brunel\u2019s assistant coach.\n\nIt spared Brunel the humiliation of being fired and gave the critics some of what they asked for, while putting the modern-minded Galthi\u00e9 perfectly into position to take charge fulltime following the World Cup in Japan.\n\nAs a TV commentator for more than a decade, Galthi\u00e9 is well placed to note what\u2019s been going wrong, and it helps that France\u2019s players will look up to him as one of the best scrumhalves to have worn the Tricolores jersey.\n\nGalthi\u00e9 has revamped the backroom staff, urgently improving poor fitness levels and sharpening up dull tactics. The French performances have looked better in the three games since Galthi\u00e9 was appointed, scoring 13 tries and one penalty try in home wins against Scotland (32-3) and Italy (47-19) and a 17-14 loss away to the Scots.\n\nEncouragingly, France played with better width and attacking intent. And some fine talents are emerging - notably 20-year-old flyhalf Romain Ntamack; right winger Damian Penaud (22) and No. 8 Gr\u00e9gory Alldritt. Left winger Aliveriti Raka made a try-scoring debut two minutes into the win against Scotland.\n\nBut the 2023 World Cup could be where they really shine. Because for all the improvements in France\u2019s running game, the same mistakes were still glaring in Scotland as soon as the opposition intensity went up a notch. The French wasted a two-try lead, looked sluggish in the attacking rucks and again made costly fumbles.\n\nThere will be no room for such sloppiness in Japan.\n\nFrance kicks off its Pool C campaign against 2015 semifinalist Argentina, and might need to beat 2003 champion England in the last pool game to qualify for the knockout rounds. In between are two games in four days against the U.S. and the tough-tackling Tongans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming out of a few difficult years - I don\u2019t think we can be world champions,\u201d said Alldritt, realistically.\n\nFrance beat Argentina 28-13 last November but this Pumas squad will be hardened by the Rugby Championship this summer. Argentina opened the southern hemisphere competition with a narrow 20-16 loss to the All Blacks and succumbed 16-10 to Australia before losing heavily to winner South Africa.\n\nSo Brunel has to make the right selections first up, or France could be on the back foot early.\n\nDoes he stick with the powerful veteran Louis Picamoles at No. 8 after a disappointing Six Nations, or trust the more mobile yet less experienced Alldritt?\n\nCan Camille Lopez be France\u2019s crafty strategist at flyhalf, or will he be the error-ridden bag of nerves who botched moves during the Six Nations? Is Ntamack ready to shoulder such responsibility with just eight test caps? Both are kickers, so whoever gets the nod will need his shooting boots on at Tokyo Stadium on Sept. 21.\n\nBrunel acknowledges most observers have written off his squad\u2019s chances of reaching the knockout stages.\n\n\u201cIf I listen to what\u2019s being said, we\u2019re not being given much credit. The objective is to qualify,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our first challenge; we know how hard our pool is.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Rugby World Cup could be problematic for a France team struggling to emerge from a slump which has turned confident players into doubtful ones.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/france_macron_rugby_91538_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
