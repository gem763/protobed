campaign, an initiative in which the organisation encourages shoppers to refrain from buying anything new for a month.\n\nA report released by the charity stated that the richest 10 per cent of the world's population are culpable for 50 per cent of global carbon emissions, while the poorer half of the planet is only responsible for 10 per cent.\n\nDanny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of Oxfam GB, emphasised the importance of taking action against environmental damage by discouraging fast fashion culture.\n\n\"These staggering facts about fashion's impact on the planet and the world's poorest people should make us all think twice before buying something new to wear,\" Mr Sriskandarajah said.\n\n\"As consumers, it's in our power to make a real difference. Buying second-hand clothes helps to slow the ferocious fast fashion cycle, giving garments a second lease of life.\"\n\nLauren Bravo, a writer from London and author of book How To Break Up With Fast Fashion, said she felt \"pretty horrified\" when she discovered the negative impact of fast fashion on the planet and workers in the garment industry.\n\n\"I read about the sheer volumes of clothes going into landfill, about dyes polluting rivers and synthetic fabrics leaching microplastics into the marine environment, and I decided that I needed to change my shopping habits,\" Bravo stated.\n\n\"I used to buy clothes as a quick fix, to be worn for a few weeks before I got bored of them. Now I only shop second-hand in charity or vintage shops, and I try harder to treasure and look after the items I have instead of viewing them as disposable.\"\n\nTo read more about how to take part in Second Hand September, visit the Oxfam website here.", "description": "A new study released by global poverty charity Oxfam has highlighted the negative impact fast fashion has on the environment\u00a0and the number of people who willingly ignore it.
