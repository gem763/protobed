I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have written Happy Valley if I hadn\u2019t seen Nurse Jackie. You could feel the creative energy buzzing through every episode, in the way it was written, shot and performed. Every episode had a hundred stories riddled through 25 minutes. It was surprising, dark, relevant and very funny. It was a show in which all the characters were complicated, flawed, sometimes unlikable but always funny and deeply engaging. It has an unparalleled place in my head as inspirational telly. God should appear as a character in TV shows more often.\n\nAdam Curtis\n\nThe Returned\n\nThe French drama The Returned has really stuck in my mind. First because it\u2019s incredibly gripping and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. But also because I think both in its story \u2013 and in the mood it creates \u2013 it somehow captures the strangeness of how it is to live in our present world. It\u2019s that feeling of living in a bubble, where inexplicable events come and go like in a strange fever dream. Yet however much you try and escape, you always find yourself returning to where you came from. You can\u2019t break out to any other kind of future. This bubble is it, but it\u2019s odd and frightening \u2013 the past keeps coming back again and again, and you don\u2019t know who to trust, and you don\u2019t even trust yourself.\n\nArmando Iannucci\n\nBattlestar Galactica\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The best form of sci-fi ... Battlestar Galactica. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy\n\nI was bowled over by Ronald D Moore\u2019s 2004 reimagining of Battlestar Galactica. The best form of sci-fi, powerfully dramatising contemporary themes such as terrorism, rebellion, prejudice, artificial intelligence and good government. All in space! No aliens, no transporters and a hugely complicated, pathetic, funny and devious bad guy in Gaius Baltar, one of the most fallible villains ever screened.\n\nSharon Horgan\n\nThe Sopranos\n\nEven with all the groundbreaking and original TV that\u2019s been made in the last 20 years \u2013 and there\u2019s been a lot \u2013 it\u2019s still The Sopranos. For the world and the language and the humanity and the inhumanity and the complete disregard for the lives of beloved characters, because who gives a fuck here comes a better one. And for Gandolfini.\n\nChris Chibnall\n\nChernobyl\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Relentless ... Chernobyl. Photograph: HBO/Sky Atlantic\n\nBoth intimate and epic, Chernobyl is a character-driven drama that becomes a portrait of a nation and a belief system. Every word and frame and sound and performance within the five episodes feels weighed with forensic precision. The result is a lean, compelling, propulsive and relentless piece of storytelling. Chernobyl is a great example of the achievements of a collective: an extraordinary piece of dramatic teamwork.\n\nJulian Fellowes\n\nMad Men\n\nI would nominate Mad Men, a show I was completely obsessed with, and my first experience of true \u201cbingeing.\u201d Its representation of the 1960s, the era of my own teens \u2013 I was 21 in 1970 \u2013 was extraordinary. The period can be unconvincing on screen, but here was a show that was authentic and moving and, at the same time, stylish and smart. I loved Jon Hamm, who was a complete revelation to me, and I had a crush on January Jones, in fact all of them were wonderful, Christina Hendricks, John Slattery, Elisabeth Moss, Jared Harris, I could go on and on.\n\nRob Delaney\n\nThe OA\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest It swung for the fences! ... The OA. Photograph: JoJo Whilden/Netflix\n\nI\u2019d say The OA is my show of the century. It\u2019s like nothing else. It\u2019s so earnest and so ambitious and not trying to be cool or edgy; I assume its creators didn\u2019t ask themselves \u201cWhat\u2019s hot right now?\u201d before they pitched it. It just swung for the fences AND it got killed by its network smack in the middle, so it can live forever in my imagination, which is inferior to those of Zal Batmanglij and Brit Marling.\n\nIssa Rae\n\nThe Office\n\nWhenever any person is thinking about writing a TV show, they\u2019re advised to look at this for reference. I did it before I made Awkward Black Girl, and again before I wrote another pilot that would not see the light of day. I was a fan of the British version and was certain the US version would butcher it, but I was so happily wrong. The US version was so perfectly, achingly relatable. From the Diversity Day episode to one of the greatest TV love stories of all time, it has truly influenced my sense of humour and it is in my canon of all-time great TV.\n\nRichard McKerrow\n\nFriday Night Lights\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Texas forever! ... Friday Night Lights. Photograph: Amazon Prime\n\nI\u2019m sure everyone is wrestling with the incredibly tough task of identifying a single show from such remarkably strong competition, most recently Chernobyl and also Narcos, Six Feet Under to name just a few. I\u2019m going with Friday Night Lights for its heart and soul, the compelling nature of its characters and storylines, the way it\u2019s filmed and how the music is scored. Once you fall in love with this series, there are just so many episodes to lose yourself in. Is it really possible that a television show can have you sharing the mantra Texas Forever?\n\nS\u00f8ren Sveistrup\n\nHouse of Cards\n\nIf I have to pick just one it would be House of Cards. The first season about the American politician Francis Underwood, his wife and their ambitions for the presidency was great fun and mind-blowing at the time. It had the whole package and seemed almost flawless \u2013 great acting, a complex and provoking story, and creators who knew how to balance the genre. Maybe the most impressive thing about the show was that we actually came to love Francis Underwood even though he was ruthless.", "description": "From Sharon Horgan and Sally Wainwright to Armando Iannucci and Julian Fellowes, the creators whose shows feature in our top 100 pick their favourite TV of the century", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cbbbce312f2cafb7314ef011dff98cff286239e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab625ca5b580d410cdfc497d9f9de5fd", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
