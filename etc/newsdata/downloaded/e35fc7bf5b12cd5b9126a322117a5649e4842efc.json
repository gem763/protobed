Hagibis is due to hit Tokyo and Yokohama on Saturday night local time and is forecast to be one of the most violent in recent history. It is measured at 870 miles wide.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get some perspective over the typhoon when lives are at stake | Ugo Monye Read more\n\nBut despite years to come up with extensive contingency plans, with the tournament director, Alan Gilpin, insisting in 2018 that the threat of natural disasters was \u201ca really hot topic for us\u201d, it is understood that before the emergence of Hagibis, organisers considered the nearby Tokyo Stadium the most suitable alternative to Yokohama.\n\nWhen that inevitably became impossible, organisers hurriedly explored moving England\u2019s match to Oita, more than 500 miles away on the south island of Kyushu. Ultimately it was decided that was not logistically viable nor safe for travelling supporters at such short notice.\n\nPlay Video 1:02 Scottish Rugby boss calls for 24-hour delay to Japan match \u2013 video\n\nWorld Rugby has repeatedly insisted it has \u201crobust contingency plans\u201d but has not expanded any further and on Thursday, when it was confirmed England\u2019s match with France and New Zealand\u2019s encounter with Italy were cancelled, Gilpin revealed there were not any in place for Scotland\u2019s game against Japan.\n\nTens of thousands of supporters have been left in limbo in Tokyo and Yokohama and while they will receive a full refund for their match tickets, World Rugby will not reimburse any travel costs. The fact organisers considered a stadium 14 miles away would initially be an appropriate alternative venue raises huge question marks over World Rugby\u2019s contingency planning.\n\nHad Oita, or Sapporo \u2013 700 miles north of Yokohama \u2013 been designated as alternatives in the first place cancelled matches could have been avoided. \u201cWe always knew there would be risks but it\u2019s rare for there to be a typhoon of this size at this stage of the year,\u201d said Gilpin on Thursday. \u201cWe have no regrets.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of any contingency plans, Scotland v Japan will either take place on Sunday or be cancelled. Scotland, who face elimination if the match is called off, have countered by insisting the match should go ahead, even if it has to be behind closed doors. The Scottish union has also threatened legal action if the match is not played.\n\n\u2018We will not be collateral damage\u2019: Scotland to fight moves to cancel Japan match Read more\n\nEngland and France have both adopted philosophical approaches to their cancellation. England have headed to south to Miyazaki, where they held a pre-tournament camp, for the weekend. Eddie Jones had initially wanted to use Miyazaki as a base during the tournament, flying in and out to host cities.\n\nOn Friday, clear of Hagibis\u2019s path, England went through a light fitness session and are set to increase their workouts on Saturday in an effort to account for not having a match. All 31 players are set to train in some capacity on Saturday but players still nursing injuries, such as Billy Vunipola, are not expected to take a full part.", "description": "World Rugby\u2019s failure to properly prepare for Japan\u2019s extreme weather has been exposed", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/821ef0285ac7c651998e027549ace5d20b96ce3e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=155fc6797a310f5e0a9452f1398cfc4d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
