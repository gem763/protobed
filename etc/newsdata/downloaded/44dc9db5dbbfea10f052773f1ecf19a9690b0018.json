Postpartum medical care generally ends after the six-week postpartum checkup, and hormones have usually evened out by that point. But studies have shown that it can take six months to a year to fully recover (physically and mentally) from childbirth. According to a study by researchers at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Nursing, it can take over eight months for pelvic floor recovery alone. Research by Dr. Julie Wray, Ph.D., of the University of Salford in England found that mothers need up to a year to recover. It\u2019s just not realistic to expect to \u201cbounce back\u201d two weeks after birth. Unfortunately, it also may not be realistic to avoid going back to work.\n\nTo aid in recovery, Dr. Jephtha Tausig, Ph.D., a psychologist in New York City, recommended that new mothers outsource some tasks. \u201cIf you can have others help with errands and chores (laundry, cleaning, making meals, etc.) that will make a huge difference,\u201d she said. Don\u2019t try to do it all, because that just might not be possible. Be gentle with yourself. \u201cBeing tired and slightly overwhelmed is all completely normal \u2014 you can't plan to accomplish much if you are the primary caregiver at home with baby,\u201d noted Dr. Nataki Douglas, M.D., Ph.D., a Newark, N.J.-based ob-gyn and an associate professor and director of translational research for the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women\u2019s Health at Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School.", "description": "Letting go of Instagram-glossy notions of the perfect pregnancy or birth will help.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/06/parenting/06parenting-emotionally-preparing/06parenting-emotionally-preparing-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-23"}
