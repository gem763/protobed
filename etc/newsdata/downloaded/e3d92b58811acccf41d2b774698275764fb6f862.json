MPs are now in the midst of five days to debate on the Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 which contained 26 bills \u2013 and will vote on whether to pass it early next week, possibly Tuesday.\n\nWith no majority and the expectation that Labour and the SNP will vote it down, the government is likely to struggle to get it through parliament.\n\nThe amendment brought by the Lib Dems if selected by the Speaker could be a significant moment in the Commons as it is another chance to show whether there is a majority for a second referendum. Another referendum on Brexit was rejected during indicative votes held in April.\n\nThe Lib Dems have said they back another vote on EU membership but, should they win a majority of seats at a general election, they would immediately revoke the government\u2019s decision to trigger article 50 and the UK would remain in the bloc.\n\nThey have weathered significant criticism amid claims the party\u2019s position is undemocratic. However, Swinson has stated that revoking article 50 is the right course of action because a no-deal Brexit would be like \u201cburning your house down\u201d.\n\nMPs who support a second Brexit referendum believe they are nearing a majority, but they remain apprehensive as it would involve winning over many of about 40 Labour MPs who either opposed or abstained on the issue at the last parliamentary vote.\n\nRuth Smeeth was one of four MPs from heavily leave-backing constituencies who defied the Labour whip in order to back a second referendum during the last vote. She quit her frontbench role, working for the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, saying that Britain \u201cneeded to leave, and leave with a deal\u201d. Smeeth argued that her position was what was best for her constituents in Stoke-on-Trent North.\n\nOn the last numbers, around 330 MPs were against a second referendum, with 292 in favour. However, pressure has been put on Labour MPs to change their positions in light of the party\u2019s clear policy in favour of a referendum on a Labour-negotiated deal.", "description": "Public should have final say on any deal PM brings back from EU summit, Lib Dems argue", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa64058714aa143c20f854a4815c6cc895c890f1/585_401_4983_2990/master/4983.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd5a6ef7f08bff4a09cd5d06512f5e28", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
