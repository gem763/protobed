The central government has sent more than 9,000 personnel to help tackle the blazes, dropped water from helicopters and used cloud seeding to encourage rain.\n\nIn the province of Jambi in Sumatra, students demonstrated at the local parliament on Thursday urging authorities to tackle the fires and the smoke, media reported.\n\nThe government launched the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certified plantation in 2011 but has accelerated certification in recent years amid mounting global pressure to address the environmental impacts of producing palm oil.\n\nThe ISPO chairman said on Thursday that certification, which covers more than 5 million hectares of land, could be revoked for plantations found to be burning land on purpose.\n\nIndonesia's government has sealed land operated by 30 companies, including foreign firms, and brought criminal charges against four, the forestry ministry's director general for law enforcement Rasio Ridho Sani told Reuters, without naming them.\n\n\"This may increase because my team is on the ground,\" he said via a text message.\n\nIn West Kalimantan, the government has issued notices for 103 companies and sealed 17 concessions, Antara reported.\n\nBurning forests is already a criminal offence under Indonesia's 1999 forestry law.\n\n(Reporting by Gayatri Suroyo and Bernadette Christina Munthe; Editing by Ed Davies and Andrew Heavens)", "description": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Authorities in Indonesia's West Kalimantan province said on Thursday they had tightened rules to try and curb slash-and-burn clearances by plantation companies - a practice linked to a wave of forest fires.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
