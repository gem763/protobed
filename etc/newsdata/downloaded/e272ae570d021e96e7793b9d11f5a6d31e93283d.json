Oh, it\u2019s a her, sorry. No, I don\u2019t think she wants to eat all the hummus and then ride the kitty, but sure, okay, go for it! How about we not throw shoes at your sister\u2019s face? Oh, they\u2019re magic shoes? Well that\u2019s \u2014 nice. What if I hold onto them so no one gets hurt from the magic? I\u2019m not allowed to because they only work for people who believe? Cool, cool. I\u2019ll just sit here humming the \u2018Paw Patrol\u2019 theme until someone tells me what to do next.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI almost always leave these play sessions feeling like there\u2019s something inherently wrong with me. However, I\u2019ve learned that lots of adults, even parents, feel this way about playing with kids. The reason is somewhat depressing: Many of us have gotten too self-conscious to let go and truly commit to unbridled play.\n\n\u201cPlay does not come [as] naturally to adults,\u201d says Priya Driscoll, early-childhood education department head at Mills College in Oakland, Calif. \u201cWe know that our society has created barriers, or that adults feel barriers that are preventing them from engaging in their own play.\u201d\n\nThere are social and cultural expectations of adults to be caretakers first and foremost, and that can inhibit their ability to play freely with kids. Then there are the unfortunate adults who didn\u2019t get to play much as children, and thus don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it now. And others may simply feel that, with all their adult responsibilities, play is a waste of time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOften there is a feeling that if you get involved in something that appears purposeless and frivolous that that\u2019s not part of our role as adults,\u201d says Stuart Brown, a doctor who founded of the National Institute for Play.\n\nRegular play, however, is vital to our development and well-being \u2014 as children and as adults. Play helps children develop the physical, cognitive, social and emotional tools they\u2019ll need to become well-adjusted adults. It\u2019s why play was declared a fundamental human right by the United Nations. Perhaps most importantly, according to Brown, play also helps children discover an \u201cauthentic sense of self.\u201d\n\nThat said, for children to be able to make that inner connection, they need to engage in spontaneous, undirected play. When adults try to control play sessions too much, they can impede a child\u2019s self-discovery, which can, in turn, lead to emotional and psychological issues down the road. As difficult as it may be to let go and not micromanage a play session, that freedom is really where the most benefits of play lie.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpontaneous play has similar benefits for adults, whether it\u2019s with kids or other grown people. \u201cThere\u2019s more drive and urgency to play in infancy and childhood than there is later in life, but the design of us Homo sapiens is to stay playful for a significant portion of our lives,\u201d Brown says. Not only does play make us happier and less stressed, but it also allows us to flex our creative muscles, which can ultimately help us be more successful in an ever-adapting society.\n\nOnce you reinvigorate those play muscles, it gets much easier to connect with your young loved ones. \u201cWe have to rediscover our own play in order to be comfortable playing with children,\u201d Driscoll says.\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re in touch with your playful adult side but the playroom and play masters (a.k.a. kids) still intimidate you, there are ways to get the ball rolling. They boil down to four words: watch, listen, respond, repeat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRather than trying to manage everything, take a step back and just notice what the child is doing. \u201cGive yourself permission to have that space to observe, instead of always thinking, \u2018I have to keep my child safe, I have to be in charge,\u2019 \u201d Driscoll suggests.\n\n\u201cLook closely at a child, and see what really engages them \u2014 what gets them motivated, what gives them a sense of pleasure. You begin to sense that if you respond to their natural proclivity, you\u2019ll be playful with them,\u201d Brown says.\n\nIt\u2019s also about collaborating, or \u201cyes and-ing\u201d as my improv coach would say. \u201cShare in their attention,\u201d Driscoll suggests. \u201cRespond to them instead of trying to direct their play. Let them take the lead.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with an infant, faces and sounds are a great place to start. Babies can process faces better than toys, so simply making funny faces at them should get things going. Hearing your voice, especially if you use baby talk, is also a proven way to engage their minds. Try reading them books with pictures of faces, or simply take them on a tour of your house or neighborhood and narrate what\u2019s going on around you. If they\u2019re at an age where they know a word or two, make sure you respond encouragingly when they interject into your narration. This helps them learn language.\n\nAD\n\nYou might even try switching up your perspective to stop your adult brain from hijacking a play session. Get down on the ground and crawl with your toddler. See what the world looks like if you hang upside down on the monkey bars with a 5-year-old. If you give yourself permission to not be the designated driver for a bit, you might experience flashes of the surprise and wonder the child you\u2019re playing with sees all the time.\n\nLastly, don\u2019t forget that every child plays a little differently, because, like all humans, they have a unique set of passions. As such, any \u201cbest practices\u201d for playing with kids should be disregarded. One may love kickball, while another just wants to draw salamanders or play the kazoo. There\u2019s no right way to set up play experiences for kids. The best you can do is support what they seem to like and get involved in any way that feels right.\n\nAD\n\nThat said, the child you\u2019re playing with shouldn\u2019t get to dictate all aspects of the play session. Play should also be about compromise and negotiation. So if you don\u2019t want to pretend to be the dinosaur kidnapper for the 23rd time in a row, make that clear. That way, they\u2019ll hopefully learn that playtime is a collaboration.\n\nAD\n\nUltimately, the more you play with kids, the easier it will get. One day, it may even become an integral part of your own play routine as an adult. I\u2019m not quite there yet, but having implemented some of the above in my most recent play session with my niece and nephew, I can say I already feel a little better about giving up some of that adult control. If all of us adults can let go and truly give ourselves over to play, I think we\u2019ll start to see what\u2019s so great about being a unicorn that eats hummus and rides kitties.\n\nAlly Hirschlag is a writer and editor at weather.com.
