The metal touched $1,502.50 on Friday, a level last\n\nseen on Aug. 23.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCv1 were up 0.1% at $1,517.40 an ounce.\n\n\"Gold has been retreating because of risk appetite returning\n\nto the market, so the concerns (over U.S.-China trade ties and\n\nglobal growth) seem to be subdued,\" Commerzbank analyst Eugen\n\nWeinberg said, adding that monetary easing by central banks\n\ncould drive a rally in gold in the medium term.\n\n\"We're likely to see a pause in the upward tend, but the\n\ntrend is still intact.\"\n\nFinancial markets around the world rose on Monday, with\n\nEuropean stocks hovering near a one-month high after data showed\n\na surprise rise in German exports and on firmer expectations of\n\nfresh stimulus by the European Central Bank later this week.\n\nMKTS/GLOB Risk sentiment was also lifted on Friday after China said it\n\nwould slash the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves,\n\nwhile U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the\n\ncentral bank would continue to \"act as appropriate\" to sustain\n\neconomic expansion. Powell's comments and a mixed U.S. employment report\n\nbolstered expectations for a rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18\n\npolicy meeting. \"With the ECB and Fed primed to further ease monetary\n\nconditions this month, it is unlikely gold will dip below\n\n$1,500/oz in the short-term,\" Howie Lee, economist at OCBC Bank\n\nsaid in a note.\n\nLower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of\n\nholding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar, making\n\ngold cheaper for investors holding other currencies.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar was steady against a basket of\n\nmajor currencies. USD/\n\nHedge funds and money managers hiked their bullish positions\n\nin COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to Sept. 3, the\n\nU.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.\n\nOn the technical side, spot gold is expected to test a\n\nsupport at $1,497 per ounce, a break below which could cause a\n\nfurther fall to $1,453, according to Reuters technical analyst\n\nWang Tao.\n\nElsewhere, silver eased 0.1% to $18.14 per ounce\n\nafter falling to a near two-week low of $17.89 earlier in the\n\nsession.\n\nPalladium XPD= jumped 1% to $1,551.48 an ounce and\n\nplatinum XPT= gained 0.3% to $952.38.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold edges up on rate cut bets, firmer equities limit upside", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC5P0A3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
