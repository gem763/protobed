I remember sitting in bed with my iPod touch propped up on my knees, watching its cast of high school friends hook up, do minor crimes, and pop drugs like Tic Tacs before sneaking back into their uniquely dysfunctional homes in the soft blue dawn. Around the same time, I started watching Gossip Girl, a succession of high-stakes Hamptons day parties and fashion shows set in a social milieu in which owning a loft in Dumbo was a sign of poverty. There was nothing in common between the lives of the characters in these aughts teen dramas and my suburban New Jersey existence, other than the fact that we were all human and were supposed to go to school. Still, there was something in them that felt true, enough to keep me watching.\n\n\n\nEuphoria premiered on HBO, a show in the glamorous, emotionally overheated teen drama tradition created by Sam Levinson. And, like many teen shows before it, it quickly occasioned questions about whether the show\u2019s depictions of teen sex, drug use, and baroque forms of cruelty were realistic. The night before the premiere, Zendaya\u2014who plays the show\u2019s protagonist, Rue\u2014posted a warning on Instagram that the show is \u201ca raw and honest portrait of addiction, anxiety, and the difficulties of navigating life today. There are scenes that are graphic, hard to watch, and can be triggering.\u201d The New York Times\u2019 statistics-crunching column The Upshot published an article headlined \u201cThe \u2018Euphoria\u2019 Teenagers Are Wild. But Most Real Teenagers Are Tame,\u201d citing data from the CDC and the University of Michigan on declining teen drug and alcohol use and sexual activity. Vice asked a caucus of ten members of Gen Z if the show was realistic; several said that despite the show\u2019s stylization and maximalism, it got things right that other teen shows had gotten wrong.\n\nThis line of inquiry misses something inherent to the teen soap opera: that the tension between its overt hyperbole and the subtler, private drama of real teen experience is what makes the genre great. \u201cWe established early on that each scene ought to be an interpretation of reality or a representation of an emotional reality,\u201d Levinson said in an interview with New York magazine. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in realism. I\u2019m interested in an emotional realism.\u201d Marcell R\u00e9v, Euphoria\u2019s cinematographer, told The Hindu that \u201cwe wanted to have something that was grounded in reality but, at the same time\u2026wanted to give teenagers a show of what they imagine for themselves, how they would see themselves in a show.\u201d\n\n\n\nThus the world of Euphoria appears almost real, but not quite. The most obvious example is the show\u2019s makeup, designed by Doniella Davy: Jules (Hunter Schafer) wears neon blooms of eyeshadow under neat geometric arcs framing her lids; Maddy (Alexa Demie) armors her brows in a dense line of rhinestones. And costume designer Heidi Bivens often dresses the cast in luxury alternative fashion analogues to teen clothes. In the first episode, Rue wears a grungy, oversized tie-dye tee by Gosha Rubchinskiy; Jules has a girly Tropical Rob bra, alime green Lou Dallas crop top, and at least four Eckhaus Latta tees. Maddy attends a school dance in an incredible crystal dress that bares as much nipple asRihanna\u2019s CDFA Award gown, and, like Bianca from Ten Things I Hate About You, owns a Prada backpack.\n\nPlus, Euphoria is lit in Contemporary Teen Colors\u2014neon pinks, hazy deep purple, the hot yolk yellow of filter-boosted late afternoon sunlight\u2014and was shot mostly on soundstages; the name or region of the suburban town where the show takes place is never given. Far from the shaky, straight-to-camera style of Snapchat or Youtube, Euphoria\u2019s cameras glide on tracks or dollies. In one shot, a rotating hallway was built to create the effect of the room spinning after Rue does two bumps of something white in the bathroom. A two-minute-long tracking shot in the season\u2019s fourth episode that swoops between its main cast at a carnival reminded me, somewhat absurdly, of a five-minute single take of the evacuation at Dunkirk in the 2007 film Atonement.\n\nBut this surreal maximalism applied to common experiences\u2014getting dressed, doing makeup, causing chaos at the town carnival, receiving an unsolicited dick pic\u2014is the point. It gives everyday life the dramatic weight; it honors the drama and deep sadness of being a teen, doing everything for the first time and testing the magnitude of different kinds of mistakes. The show\u2019s central plot, which involves a Grindr equivalent, several assaults, and revenge porn blackmail, is ridiculous, but Euphoria\u2019s strongest quality is its tone, the way the storytelling incorporates not only Rue\u2019s addiction, but her anxiety and depression. Being a depressed teen may look grimy and uneventful, but it doesn\u2019t feel that way; it feels world-rending and vertiginous. For some people, it feels like a spinning hallway, smeared glitter eyeliner, and a bilious green light.\n\n\n\nIf you asked me when I was fourteen what piece of media felt like the truest representation of my emotions, I probably would have cited the music video for \u201cHelena\u201d by My Chemical Romance, the one where the dead woman climbs out of her coffin and does a ballet. When I first saw it, I was stunned: the video was the most extravagant, defiant, hilarious expression of sadness I had ever seen. It was the biggest sadness in the world. Euphoria, of course, contains more nuance and range and original ideas, but I suspect the appeal is similar: sometimes, you need to see the largest feelings in the world given the space they deserve.\n\n", "description": "Why hyperbole is the only realistic thing when you\u2019re a teen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6dd1b3bd9807000828a9ec/lede/1567479775223-cq5damweb1200675.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
