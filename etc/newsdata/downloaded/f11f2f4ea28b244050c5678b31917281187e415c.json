However, if they pull off an attack, this can lead to malicious executables being launched every time the VPN is being loaded, as well as application whitelisting bypass.\n\nCNET: Facebook suspends tens of thousands of apps following Cambridge Analytica scandal\n\nIn order to test the flaw, SafeBreach Labs crafted a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) unsigned .exe file. When a vulnerable version of the VPN was launched, the file was executed as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM by the legitimate Forcepoint application.\n\nThe root cause of the bug is a lack of a quoted string between the executable's path and arguments on the command line, causing a Forcepoint VPN startup process to split itself when space characters are parsed.\n\nThe researchers reported their findings to Forcepoint on September 5 and the company confirmed the vulnerability's validity on the same day. A CVE was issued by September 16, and after a patch was issued, Forcepoint released a security advisory on September 19.\n\nTechRepublic: Organizations struggle to manage cyberthreats without automation\n\nIt is recommended that Forcepoint VPN users upgrade to version 6.6.1 or higher to protect themselves from compromise.\n\nZDNet has reached out to Forcepoint with additional queries and will update when we hear back.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
