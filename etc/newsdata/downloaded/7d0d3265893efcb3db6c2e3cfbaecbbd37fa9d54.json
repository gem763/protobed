He took into account 12 key measures - such as vigour, eye contact, hand temperature, positioning and length - needed to convey respect and trust to the recipient. This was his formula: Use right hand, a complete grip and a firm squeeze (but not too strong)\n\nEnsure fingers are under the receiving palm\n\nPosition hand in a mid-point position between yourself and the other person\n\nA cool and dry palm, approximately three shakes, with a medium level of vigour\n\nHold for no longer than two to three seconds\n\nKeep eye contact throughout\n\nAccompany with a good natural smile and an appropriate accompanying verbal statement\n\n'There has been evidence to suggest that many behaviours, such as hugs, fall within a window of approximately three seconds and this study has confirmed that handshakes that occur in this time frame feel more natural to those who participate in the greeting.\n\n'While shaking hands for longer may appear to be a warm gesture on the surface, we found that they negatively affected the behaviour of the recipient, even after the handshake was finished.\n\n'Politicians are particularly keen on prolonged handshakes, which are often used an expression of warmth but also as a means of demonstrating authority.\n\n'However, our findings suggest that while doing so might look impressive for the cameras, this behaviour could potentially jeopardise the quality of their working and personal relationships from the beginning, which could have repercussions for millions of people.'\n\nThe team found participants showed less interactional enjoyment after the longer handshake, laughing less and showing increased anxiety.\n\nHandshakes lasting less than three seconds resulted in less subsequent smiling, but did feel more natural to those who participated.\n\nNo behavioural changes were associated with the no-handshake control experiment.\n\nThe results can be found in the Perceptual And Motor Skills journal, Effects Of Handshake Duration On Other Nonverbal Behavior.\n\nPreviously in 2011 Dr Nagy analysed hugs and what they say about shared experiences.", "description": "Psychology experts from the University of Dundee said people were made uneasy by uncomfortable introductions and they could suffer negative effects even after the shake had ended.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19547720-0-image-a-25_1570722867589.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
