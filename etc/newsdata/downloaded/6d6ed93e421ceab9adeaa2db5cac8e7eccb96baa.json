Liz Cheney faults Democrats' impeachment inquiry for Turkey's invasion of Syria", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, said Monday on Fox & Friends that Turkey's invasion of Syria is a \"part of\" the result of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump by Democrats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about it, Brian,\u201d Cheney said to host Brian Kilmeade, who has opened criticized the decision. \u201cI think that what we\u2019re seeing happen is going to have ramifications \u2014 not just in the Middle East but around the world. If our adversaries begin to seek weakness, if our adversaries begin to think we won\u2019t defend our allies, that we won\u2019t defend our interests, that\u2019s provocative.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cBut, I also want to say that the impeachment proceedings that are going on and what the Democrats are doing themselves to try to weaken this president is part of this.\u201d\n\nHer comments come as Trump faces widespread and bipartisan backlash for withdrawing U.S. troops from the region.\n\nWhat we know: Turkey's offensive in Syria\n\nCritics of the decision have come from both sides of the aisle, and they argue the action has betrayed a close U.S. allyship with the Kurds and risks creating a chaotic and dangerous situation as Turkey views a Kurdish militia that dominates the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces as a terrorist group.\n\n.@RepLizCheney says that Turkey decided to attack the Kurds base on the Democrats starting impeachment proceedings.

Over the weekend, reports emerged that hundreds of ISIS supporters escaped Kurdish-established detention camp, Ain Issa, after Turkish airstrikes hit the area, and that the Kurds announced a deal with Syria\u2019s Russian backed government.\n\nA few weeks ago, Cheney suggested that the phone call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart was \u201cstarting to seem like a political set up.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Liz Cheney: Democrats' impeachment inquiry 'part of' Turkey's invasion", "description": "Wyoming Republican Rep.
