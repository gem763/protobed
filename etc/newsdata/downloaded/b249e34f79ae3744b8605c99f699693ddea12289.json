The second-place winner, Tang Ziging of China, was 2.1 points behind Biles, who bested her record margin of victory of 1.693 set last year.\n\nEarlier in the week, Biles broke the record for most individual medals overall by a woman at the world championships. She broke the tie with Russian gymnast Svetlana Khorinka.\n\nSIMONE BILES MAKES HISTORY AGAIN WITH FLOOR ROUTINE, WINS 6TH US TITLE\n\nThe Texas native is now just one medal shy of beating Belarusian gymnast Vitaly Scherbo, who holds the all-time record of 23 medals among men or women.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s really impressive for someone to be able to do that; I guess that\u2019s me,\u201d Biles told The Washington Post on Tuesday \u201cI haven\u2019t got a chance to process it yet, but I think we\u2019ll do some celebrating tonight for all of it \u2014 for the team, for the medal count, for the fifth year in a row.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"Every year, it feels better and better just because we're adding to the legacy,\" Biles told reporters. \"I feel like I never think of records.
