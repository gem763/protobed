It has cleverly preyed upon this tension by waging terror attacks in Turkey it declined to claim credit for, knowing full well that Erdogan and his government might blame them on the PKK, which it did on more than one occasion.\n\nTurkey, meanwhile, had maintained a see-no-evil policy (or worse) with respect to ISIS as its sovereign territory became a staging ground for exported jihad, not to mention a fallback base of operations for the many agents of ISIS\u2019s Amniyat, or intelligence service, who were dispatched out of Syria and into Western Europe.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Weiss", "Thedailybeast.Com Trump-Just-Opened-The-Way-For-Turkey-To-Invade-Syriaand-Isis-To-Make-A-Big-Comeback"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
