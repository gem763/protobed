The event was supposed to benefit the Special Olympics. The league would not address China\u2019s decision to cancel the event directly. Instead, the NBA would only say that the cancellation was not their decision, ESPN reports.\n\nAccording to ABC 7 via ESPN:\n\nOn Tuesday, an NBA Cares event with the Nets at an education center in Shanghai was canceled by the Chinese government. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said the league would still donate computers to the center. The Lakers proceeded with a practice Wednesday that was closed to the media, a team source told ESPN. The Lakers and Brooklyn Nets are scheduled to play the first of two preseason games in the country Thursday. Silver is expected to address both teams later on Wednesday. Silver, speaking in Japan on Tuesday, said he and the league are \u2018apologetic\u2019 over the outcome and reaction that followed Morey\u2019s tweet, but he noted that \u2018we are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression.\u2019\n\nThe Chinese state broadcaster (CCTV) has said they will not broadcast the NBA preseason games in China. In a statement posted to their social media account, CCTV cited their dissatisfaction with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s response to Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Silver is currently in China, trying to make amends with the communist country\u2019s leadership.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "China has canceled an NBA Cares event featuring the Los Angeles Lakers, as the communist nation continues to retaliate against the NBA after", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/4ef0d404-14af-4ae9-98e1-1b4fb96f6c63-640x335.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
