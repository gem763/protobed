The H1 is a successor to the W1, a chip that allowed for some creative workarounds for the limitations of Bluetooth for easier syncing with devices. H1 moves from Bluetooth 4.2 to Bluetooth 5, and it enables \"Hey Siri\" hands-free voice commands.\n\nThe new headphones will include an additional feature called \"Adaptive EQ,\" which will tune low and mid frequencies to match the shape of your ear\u2014similar to how speakers like the Sonos One scan the room and adapt their output accordingly.\n\nWhereas AirPods were external earbuds, AirPods Pro will be in-ear headphones. They will come with interchangeable tips in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Apple will include an audio-testing tool to help users determine which size is best for them. And the headphones will use a \"vent system\" to \"equalize pressure\" and \"minimize discomfort,\" Apple's release claims.\n\nThe key pitch, though, is active noise cancelation. Previously a feature of expensive, over-ear headphones, noise cancelation has been getting into in-ear headphones more recently. The microphones in AirPods Pro will listen to external sound and work to block it in the user's ear, updating up to 200 times per second.\n\nUsers will be able to swap between this active noise cancelation and a \"Transparency\" mode, which allows more external sound, either with a new force sensor on the hardware itself or by bringing up a software menu on the iOS, watchOS, or iPadOS device with which the AirPods Pro are synced.\n\nApple promises battery life of 4.5 hours of listening time per charge for the buds themselves, and like AirPods, the buds will come with a charging case. With multiple in-case charges, the company claims up to 24 hours of total listening time.\n\nAirPods Pro will cost $249\u2014and will come only in the color white, despite earlier rumors that they might come in additional colors. They're available to order online today, and orders will ship on October 30. They'll also be available in Apple retail stores on that date.\n\nListing image by Apple", "description": "They're in-ear headphones with active noise canceling, and they aren't cheap.", "authors": ["Samuel Axon"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AirPods-Pro-lifestyle-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
