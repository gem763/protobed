The decision was widely seen as a play to limit liability.\n\nThe shutoff affected customers in 34 counties, and Amador and Calaveras counties were the last areas to get power back. PG&E doesn't know exactly how many people were affected by the shutoff because its customer tally counts individual meters, not the number of people in a household.\n\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday lambasted PG&E for the blackouts that have left hundreds of thousands of people without power this week.\n\n\"This is not a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades.
