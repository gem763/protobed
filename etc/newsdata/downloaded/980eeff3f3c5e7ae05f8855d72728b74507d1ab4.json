Van Roosmalen (2-0 MMA, 0-0 BMMA) and his opponent Cris Lencioni (5-2 MMA, 2-2 BMMA) were supposed to fight at a contracted weight of 145 pounds.\n\nBefore announcing the official weight, Mazzulli called for the towel. Not surprisingly, Van Roosmalen\u2019s underwear didn\u2019t weigh the difference. Van Roosmalen, his team, and the commission huddled near the scale and discussed the large miss.\n\nAfter they parted ways, Mazzulli told MMA Junkie he\u2019d be making a notation in van Roosmalen\u2019s file with the Association of Boxing Commissions to keep van Roosmalen from fighting at featherweight again, forcing him to move up to lightweight for future bouts. Mazzulli indicated van Roosmalen was receptive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my requirement that there\u2019s a 10-pound difference in weight (to keep a fight from being canceled),\u201d Mazzulli said. \u201cI always tell the fighter. First of all, he\u2019ll be going up in weight. He\u2019ll never ever fight at that weight again. He\u2019s a (kickboxing) world champion in the past. He understands. So he\u2019ll be required to go up in weight. He understands it, he accepted it, everything is fine.\n\n\u201cI wanted to reiterate again that he is going up in weight. He will never fight again at that weight. Everywhere. I\u2019ll put him on the MMA registry that he\u2019s required to be going up in weight.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Mazzulli said he\u2019d like to see promotions and fighters take advantage of catchweight or non-traditional weight class fights.\n\n\u201cI explained to him as him as well \u2013 we have fighters fighting at 160,\u201d Mazzulli said. \u201cPaul Daley is fighting at 175. It\u2019s a weight class for me at 160. But it\u2019s a contract weight. I don\u2019t care if he fights at 152. It\u2019s about fighters\u2019 safety and fighters\u2019 health and he understands that.\u201d\n\nShortly after the miss, Bellator officials told MMA Junkie that the bout between Lencioni and van Roosmalen was canceled. The commission and promotion gave Lencioni the option, and Lencioni declined the fight. Lencioni will be paid his show money.", "description": "Former kickboxing champion Robin van Roosmalen missed weight by 9.25 pounds Friday and his fight with Cris Lencioni was scrapped.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Mmajunkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/robin-van-roosmalen-bellator-232-pre.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
