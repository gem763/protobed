I think everybody heard the chants, but we stood together and we made certain decisions.\u201d\n\nManager Gareth Southgate and his squad discussed whether or not to stay on the pitch during the second stoppage just before half-time and spoke about the issue again at the break before going out for the second half. They had agreed to go off if there were more incidents, but Mings did not hear any more racist chanting during the second period.", "description": "Tyrone Mings has revealed that he first heard racist chanting from Bulgaria supporters during the warm-up before England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifying victory in Sofia.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Sam Wallace", "Keith Hackett", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000213038659-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0yUt6ugM98uus3IXa1PYRSiEDwx4aC1qOUmIyWB_dcY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
