But politically, Trump suffered a rare repudiation by his party when two-thirds of House Republicans backed a resolution disapproving of his decision to withdraw American troops.\n\nThat included such leaders as Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise and Dick Cheney. Mitch McConnell has been critical in the Senate, and Lindsey Graham said he\u2019s prepared to be \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s worst nightmare\u201d on the issue.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN, DEBATE TARGET: HERE\u2019S WHY IT MAY NOT MATTER\n\nAt the same time, the president has watched a series of diplomats march up to the House and deliver damaging testimony about him and Ukraine\u2014including, Thursday, his appointee Gordon Sondland.\n\nHis own acting chief of staff delivered a setback Thursday by essentially admitting to a quid pro quo. Mick Mulvaney told reporters that Trump held up military aid to Ukraine: \"Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we hung up the money.\u201d In walking it back later, Mulvaney complained that \"the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump.\" Except no journalistic interpretation was needed for the on-camera remarks.\n\nAnd the media were practically gleeful when a White House meeting\u2014on Syria, as it happens--ended with House Democratic leaders walking about and complaining of a Trump diatribe.\n\n\u201cHe was insulting, particularly to the speaker,\u201d Chuck Schumer told reporters, adding: \u201cHe called her a third-rate politician.\u201d (Other accounts said Trump used \u201cthird-grade.\u201d)\n\n\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,\u201d Nancy Pelosi agreed.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweeted rebuttal: \u201cNancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her \u2018upstairs,\u2019 or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!\u201d\n\nLadies and gentlemen, your United States government. And it\u2019s worth noting that it was Trump who walked out of a meeting with Chuck and Nancy last January after a similar spat.\n\nCommentators and even some news anchors were quick to adopt the Pelosi pushback that Trump had suffered a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d The Democratic narrative is that he\u2019s losing it.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nThis argument was bolstered, according to the media, when Trump released a shockingly blunt letter he had sent to Tayyip Erdogan:\n\n\u201cLet's work out a good deal! You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2014 and I will\u2026\n\n\u201cHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump, who ran against endless wars, has defended his stance by saying the Kurds are \u201cno angels\u201d and \u201cwhat does that have to do with the United States of America if they\u2019re fighting over Syria\u2019s land?\u201d\n\nNone of this means impeachment is a step closer. Indeed, while a new Gallup poll says 52 percent of those surveyed believe Trump should be impeached and removed, only 6 percent of those are Republicans. (This is quite similar to a much-criticized Fox poll that put the top figure at 51 percent.)\n\nBut my sense is that while many Republicans welcome the chance to demonstrate their independence on foreign policy, they are still dead set against impeachment.\n\nStill, the latest news on that front has hardly been favorable to the White House.\n\nMick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said in the little-used briefing room yesterday that federal aid to Ukraine was held up in part because of Trump\u2019s demands that the country investigate possible corruption by Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nHe also said of Trump: \u201cDid he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nSondland, meanwhile, gave the press his opening statement before testifying that Trump told him to work with Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine. He was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by that because \u201cthe men and women of the State Department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility.\u201d Sondland said he didn\u2019t realize until later that Giuliani\u2019s goal may have been \u201cto involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment probe and the Syria situation aren\u2019t strictly related. In fact, Pelosi made a point of saying a foreign policy disagreement would never be grounds for impeachment. But the combined force is adding to a sense of things spinning out of control\u2014making an alleged meltdown less important than political paralysis.", "description": "Donald Trump suddenly finds himself fighting a two-front war.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/17/694940094001_6095679888001_6095672548001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
