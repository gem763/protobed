We walking. Bop.\u201d Dwright Boone-Doty said, recounting the November 2015 killing in a tape played during his murder trial this week. \u201cHit the ground. Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop. I\u2019m laughing.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s killing horrified Chicago, which has long endured gun violence and gang conflict. Prosecutors spent nearly three weeks presenting evidence against Boone-Doty, 25, and his co-defendant Corey Morgan, 31, before resting their case on Wednesday. They argue that the execution-style killing, motivated by gang rivalries, was part of a revenge plot for a shooting that killed Morgan\u2019s brother and injured his mother. To prove its case, the state\u2019s attorney has used novel DNA evidence, jailhouse recordings and testimony from a close family friend to paint the alleged killers as callous and calculating.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTyshawn brought a basketball to Dawes Park. Corey Morgan, Dwright Doty and Kevin Edwards brought guns,\u201d Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Margaret Hillmann told jurors, also naming Edwards, who has pleaded guilty to driving a getaway vehicle. \u201cAnd Dwright Doty took out a .40-caliber handgun, and he executed Tyshawn in broad daylight.\u201d\n\nMorgan\u2019s defense attorney has argued that Boone-Doty, who is accused of pulling the trigger, acted alone. Boone-Doty\u2019s defense, meanwhile, has questioned the DNA evidence and suggested he was lying in the jailhouse tapes to impress another inmate.\n\nOn Nov. 2, 2015, police say, Tyshawn was playing on the Dawes Park basketball court on the city\u2019s South Side when he was led him into an alley outside of anyone\u2019s view and then shot seven times.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was one of the most evil things I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Rev. Michael Pfleger, the priest who later presided over Tyshawn\u2019s funeral, told the Associated Press. \u201cI was over there and to see a young boy laying in an alley next to a garbage can with his basketball a few feet away, this assassination of a 9-year-old child took violence in Chicago to a new low.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne bullet tore through the boy\u2019s thumb and shattered, nearly severing the finger and shooting shell fragments into Tyshawn Lee\u2019s face. Tyshawn\u2019s palm was close enough to the barrel for the ignited gun powder to burn his skin, Ponni Arunkumar the Cook County medical examiner later testified. Two more bullets pierced his right hand. The fatal blow hit the boy\u2019s temple, piercing his brain and exiting through the other side of his head, Arunkumar said.\n\nFor weeks after Tyshawn\u2019s body was found, police hit a dead end. No one had seen the shooting. Investigators didn\u2019t know why the boy had been targeted. A cash reward for information in the case grew to more than $10,000.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBreak the code of silence,\u201d a reward poster on a memorial erected at the site of the murder read. \u201cSpeak for me!\u201d\n\nEventually, several teenage witnesses told police they had seen Boone-Doty, Morgan and Edwards near the park before the shooting. Police developed a theory: the three men belonged to the Bang Bang Gang/Terrordome faction of the Black P-Stones plotted to murder the 9-year-old to send a message to the boy\u2019s father, who allegedly belonged to a rival gang, the Killa Ward faction Gangster Disciples. Other members of the Gangster Disciples had shot Morgan\u2019s mother and killed his brother in October 2015.\n\nAD\n\nBut since no one witnessed the shooting and little physical evidence connected Boone-Doty to the crime scene, police and prosecutors had a difficult challenge in charging him \u2014 until a scientist agreed to use a controversial, cutting-edge DNA technique called \u201cprobabilistic genotyping\u201d for the first time in Illinois. The geneticist said the method, which uses an algorithm to model and identify DNA profiles, was able to connect mixed and damaged DNA samples collected from Tyshawn\u2019s basketball to Boone-Doty.\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors charged Morgan and Edwards with murder four weeks after the slaying but waited until March 2016 to charge Boone-Doty after a grand jury voted to indict him. Prosecutors allege Morgan and Edwards helped plot the killing and drove Boone-Doty to and from the crime scene.\n\nWhen the trial began Sept. 17, prosecutors introduced the jailhouse recordings, which were taped for authorities by an unlikely source: A hardened gang leader.\n\nAD\n\nDemetrius Murray, then second-in-command within a faction of the Gangster Disciples, had recently been convicted of a shooting and sentenced to 10 years in prison in the same facility where Boone-Doty was held. Around January 2016, he agreed to wear a recorder, hoping he might get out early for his cooperation. But he had another motive as well, he told the court on Monday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy other motivation was that, like, a person that brags about things like that, it don\u2019t add up to me,\u201d he testified. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nBoone-Doty told Murray in one recording that he had planned to kidnap Tyshawn and torture the boy by cutting off all of his fingers.\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t never stepped back and thought, damn, I shouldn\u2019t have did that?\u201d Murray asked Boone-Doty, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t got that in my head, not even a little bit,\u201d Boone-Doty answered.\n\nAD\n\nHe also bragged on tape about watching the gunfire fatally hit the 9-year-old boy.\n\n\u201cI hit shorty like 12 times,\u201d Boone-Doty told the high-ranking gang member in jail, the Sun-Times reported. \u201cHe so little. The (bullets) are coming out. I see that b---- go in his head. Boom! That b---- came out, right here, like.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn court, Boone-Doty\u2019s attorneys suggested their client was trying to look tough in Murray\u2019s eyes. \u201cPeople say a lot of things, don\u2019t they?\u201dAssistant Public Defender Danita Ivory asked Murray on cross-examination, the Sun-Times reported.\n\nHis lawyers also questioned whether the state can prove he was the man who pulled the trigger and pointing out that the forensic expert who did the DNA tests had doubts about using the technique in this case.\n\n\u201cI was convinced by people expressing to me the importance of this case and the need for me to \u2018man up,\u2019\u201d said John Buckleton, the co-creator of the DNA-testing technique called STRmix, during a cross-examination.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWas there a lot of pressure to solve this case?\u201d Assistant Public Defender Michael Buresh asked Buckleton on Sept. 24, the Sun-Times reported.\n\n\u201cI believe it was considered important and they were prepared to invest resources,\u201d he answered.\n\nDespite his apparent hesitancy, Buckleton told the court the DNA match gave \u201cvery strong support\u201d to the prosecution\u2019s claim that Boone-Doty had held the basketball.\n\nClosing arguments are scheduled Thursday before two separate juries begin deliberations over the charges against Boone-Doty and Morgan.\n\nEdwards, who police said drove the SUV used to stalk Tyshawn and flee after the shooting, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison last month, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAD", "description": "Prosecutors used DNA evidence, GPS tracking and a recorded jailhouse boast to lay out the frightening final minutes of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee's life.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tiCzpiU3uh3F5EJoJBnE0QhP__U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FJYKBFW2LYI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg"}
