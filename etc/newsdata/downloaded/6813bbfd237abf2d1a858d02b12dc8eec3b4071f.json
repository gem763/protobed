And in the moment we started speaking about our match, and we finished it knowing he was sacked. It's a good story, yes?\"\n\nEmery has also backed Gracia to return to work before too long, adding: \"He is a very good coach, as he showed last year in Watford.\n\n\"The club decided, and I have to respect that. He is going to work and he is going to continue his career like he is, like a great coach.\"\n\nWhile he does not have the same relationship with Flores, they have faced each other on plenty of occasions.\n\nEmery recalls when the pair met in the Europa League quarter-final in 2010, his Valencia side losing to Atletico Madrid - who went on to lift the trophy under Flores.\n\n\"I remember it,\" he said. \"Every coach, every player, every person in football remembers some things. I remember we drew 2-2 at home and we drew 0-0 away.\n\n\"In the last minute the referee did not give us an amazing penalty for the opportunity to win. In my way, everything that happened to me is something to learn from, for experience.\n\n\"Sometimes it's positive, at the moment more positive, but also negative. I learned from it all.\"", "description": "Arsenal head coach Unai Emery has revealed he was sat in his hometown with Javi Gracia discussing the upcoming match against Watford when the Hornets sacked the Spaniard.
