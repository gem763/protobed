Protesters are objecting to laws they see as eroding the region\u2019s autonomy.\n\nThe app was initially blocked from being approved, since all App Store apps require the company to vet them first, but was then allowed on to the store. It was ultimately deleted again.\n\nApple said: \u201cThe app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety and criminals have used it to victimise residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws.\u201d\n\nThe US company was the subject of a furious tirade from China\u2019s state-backed People\u2019s Daily, which accused the company of \u201cletting poisonous software have its way\u201d.\n\n\u201cDoes this main Apple intended to be an accomplice to the rioters?\u201d the publication said.\n\nIt is not the first time Apple has banned US news apps from its service in China. In 2017, Apple blocked the New York Times in mainland China over unspecified \u201cviolations\u201d.\n\nThe Chinese market remains hugely important to Apple as the company battles faltering demand for its smartphones. It registered China as its third largest market in its last financial year, bringing in $44bn (\u00a336bn).\n\nJim Killock, executive director of digital rights organisation Open Rights Group, said it was \u201creprehensible\u201d that Apple appeared to be \u201cdoing the Chinese government\u2019s work for them\u201d.\n\n\u201cApple should stand for democratic values and immediately reverse their decision to delete apps being used by protesters to organise,\u201d he said.\n\nOther US brands have also been accused of bowing to Chinese state pressure. Gaming company Blizzard banned a professional e-sports gamer over his support for Hong Kong\u2019s protests. The US National Basketball Association saw Chinese companies sever their ties with it, apparently over a single pro-protest Tweet from one team manager.\n\nThe timing is particularly awkward for Apple, which is in the process of launching its own news app, Apple News+, around the world.\n\nLast week, Tim Cook took to Twitter to praise student journalists at an event in Italy. \u201cQuality journalism is crucial to all our lives, communities and wider society,\u201d he said.", "description": "Apple has blocked a US news app from its Chinese service as the iPhone maker is accused of\u00a0bowing\u00a0to pressure from state censors over pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
