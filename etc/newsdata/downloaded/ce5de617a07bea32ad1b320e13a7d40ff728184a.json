REUTERS/Antonio Bronic/Files\n\nThe common currency has been rattled this year by dismal manufacturing data, as well as by worries that deepening economic tensions between the United States and China could make euro zone economies grow even slower.\n\nBut with Britain\u2019s prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders agreeing a new deal for Britain to exit the bloc, and with U.S.-China tensions easing, the euro was enjoying a sigh of relief.\n\n\u201cWithout Brexit, the euro might be now liberated from this burden,\u201d said Antje Praefcke, a forex analyst at Commerzbank.\n\nMoreover, expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates at the Oct. 30 meeting added further optimism, given that this would shrink yield differentials between the United States and euro area.\n\n\u201cThe fed looks more willing to cut\u201d in the immediate term, said Praefcke.\n\nThe euro was last trading flat at $1.1122 EUR=EBS, not far from $1.1140, its highest since Aug. 26.\n\nThe index which tracks the dollar against six major currencies was also last flat at $97.581 .DXY.\n\nThe pound was slightly weaker, down 0.2% at $1.2865, but still very close to the five-month high of $1.2988 it reached on Thursday after the U.K. and the EU agreed to a Brexit deal.\n\nTraders worry that an initial relief at securing the long-awaited Brexit deal could be brief, however, because the prime minister still needs to sell the agreement to sceptical lawmakers when parliament sits on Saturday.\n\nThe yuan held steady against the dollar after data showed China\u2019s economy grew at the weakest pace in more than 27 years in the third quarter due to a costly trade war with the United States and weak factory production.\n\nIn the offshore market, the yuan was last neutral at 7.0828 against the dollar. CNH=EBS\n\nElsewhere, the Norwegian krone was very close to breaking the all-time low of 10.2215 it plunged to against the euro on Thursday, last trading flat at 10.2105. EURNOK=D3\n\nAnalysts were scratching their heads why the krone was so weak, saying one possible explanation could be the weak demand for Norwegian equities.\n\n\u201cHistorically the NOK has often traded weak towards the end of the year, but our FX analysts are struggling to find the flows that explain this seasonal weakness,\u201d said SEB analysts in a note to clients.", "description": "The euro was hovering on Friday around the seven-week high it reached against the U.S. dollar on Thursday as hopes that a Brexit deal between Britain and the European Union could prevent an economic recession in the euro zone.", "authors": ["Olga Cotaga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442211304&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0M1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
