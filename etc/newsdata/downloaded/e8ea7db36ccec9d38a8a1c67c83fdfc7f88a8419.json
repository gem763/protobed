The terms of these loans can be as short as overnight.\n\nWhen the Fed adds money to the financial system through the repo market, it is acting as a lender. In typical repo-market transactions, lenders can include money-market mutual funds, banks or hedge funds that are seeking to earn a slightly higher rate of interest than what is available from holding very-short-term government securities. The borrowers are often banks, securities firms or hedge funds that use the cash to finance positions in the market.\n\nBanks and hedge funds borrow or lend depending on their needs and investment goals.\n\nThe Fed began offering repo loans last month after a shortage of available cash in the financial system led repo rates to climb as financial companies scrambled for overnight funding. The moves marked the first time since the financial crisis that the Fed had taken such actions.\n\nOn Friday, the Fed said it would extend its scheduled repo lending through Nov. 4. It said it would continue to offer overnight repos for an aggregate amount of at least $75 billion each night through Nov. 4.\n\nThe Fed said it would extend its two-week repo loans as well. It plans to offer at least $45 billion between Oct. 8 and Oct. 11. After that, the amount available will drop to $35 billion through Oct. 29.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 09:29 ET (13:29 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
