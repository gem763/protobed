But that was bound to happen to the Ohio State sophomore quarterback at some point this season.\n\nThe Georgia transfer, who had accounted for 23 touchdowns in his first five games as starter, ran into a stout defense, got chased around, sacked and intercepted for the first time in his college career. But he stayed cool and engineered enough explosive plays to help No. 4 Ohio State bury the Spartans.\n\nFields threw two touchdown passes and plunged in for another score as the Buckeyes overcame an inauspicious start to roll to a 34-10 win. J.K. Dobbins rushed for 172 yards and a touchdown and is well on his way to the best season of his Ohio State career.\n\n\u201cI think we showed flashes, but we weren\u2019t really consistent the whole game on the offensive side,\u201d Fields said. \u201cIf we get better at that and more consistent about that, I think we\u2019ll definitely be one of the best offenses in the country.\u201d\n\nThe Buckeyes (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten) had to work to figure out Michigan State\u2019s defense at the beginning, after blowing out every opponent through the first five games. They gained just 16 yards on 16 plays - with zero rushing yards - in the first quarter but finally got unstuck. Dobbins, Fields and two other backs then piled up 323 yards on the ground in the next three quarters.\n\n\u201cWe were killing ourselves,\u201d Dobbins said of the strange first quarter. \u201cWe had to get that fixed, get it going, then the offense started to roll.\u201d\n\nFields finished 17 for 25 for 206 yards and was sacked three times - twice by Michigan State linebacker Joe Bachie, who finished with 11 tackles.\n\nDOBBINS KEEPS ROLLING\n\nThe junior who likely will be playing in the NFL next year ran the ball 24 times, averaged over 7 yards per carry and had an electrifying 67-yard breakaway for a touchdown late in the first half. That was against a defense that was allowing an average of just 55.8 yards per game.\n\nDobbins has 826 yards at the halfway point of the regular season, despite sitting for the second half of early season blowouts. He passed the 3,000-yard rushing mark for his career last week at Nebraska.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMichigan State: Gave the Buckeyes their first real test of the season but couldn\u2019t keep up. They strung together some chunk plays at times but couldn\u2019t find the end zone as the Ohio State defense bore down.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a really good team - it\u2019s difficult to get points on them,\u201d said Spartans quarterback Brian Lewerke, who was 20 for 38 for 218 yards, a touchdown and an interception. \u201cI think we moved the ball really well, but we\u2019ve just got to finish in the end.\u201d\n\nOhio State: The Spartans pushed Fields way out of his comfort zone and the Ohio State defense played well , surrendering just 67 rushing yards.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what playing against a team like Michigan State in the Big Ten, a conference game like this is,\u201d Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard, its gritty and it was great to see the guys respond, especially in the second quarter.\u201d\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nWith Ohio State leading 3-0 in the second quarter, Fields completed a sideline pass to Binjimen Victor, who turned it into a 60-yard touchdown. The Buckeyes opened it up from there.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nOhio State finally showed some weaknesses but likely showed well enough against another ranked team to remain in the top four . Michigan State could drop out.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201cI knew we were special from day one, just everybody else didn\u2019t know,\u201d said Ohio State defensive end Chase Young, who has 8.5 sacks this season. \u201cThat\u2019s how we feel. It\u2019s good to get national attention but we\u2019re not focused on that.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan State: At No. 8 Wisconsin on Saturday.\n\nOhio State: After an off week, the Buckeyes play at Northwestern on Oct. 18.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Justin Fields looked less like Superman and more like a mere mortal at times against No. 25 Michigan State on Saturday night.
