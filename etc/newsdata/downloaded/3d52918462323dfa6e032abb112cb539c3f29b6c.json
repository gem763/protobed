Agency has its downsides.\n\nPlus, you\u2019re about one step removed from what is basically a legal, commonplace hostage situation: The parents of their parents\u2019 grandkids know they have potentially cruel leverage in their control over access to these kids.\n\nThat makes people in your situation uniquely right to be concerned about harming the underlying relationship.\n\nSympathy doesn\u2019t help you with the dilemma of your next visit, alas.\n\nAD\n\nBut I hope you can start to address it by cutting its duration 75 percent. A two-week home visit involving two small children sounds ghastly: too long to sustain guest manners and too short for housemate manners to kick in.\n\nAD\n\nI also encourage, if financially feasible, the neutral-setting dodge. At least until the kids grow out of the feral stage, move your visits/vacations to a kid-friendly attraction built for the kind of punishment toddlers dish out. Grandma\u2019s treat! No one else has to know you\u2019re primarily treating yourself to a house untrampled by savages.\n\nIf that\u2019s not realistic, then \u2014 again, as finances permit \u2014 they can stay at a hotel or rental near you, framed as a gift to them. \u201cThere\u2019s a pool!\u201d Or, as an act of sympathy: \u201cI realized a house full of heirlooms sets kids up for failure.\u201d (It does, by the way.) \u201cSo, less pressure on you and the kids, plus more privacy for you and [husband]. It\u2019s hard to be a parent in front of an audience. I remember well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOr, discuss options with her: \u201cUn-childproofed house, lesson learned. I\u2019m sorry. Any thoughts on Plan B?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIf your daughter ever gives you a clean shot at the larger issue by, say, bringing up her concerns about bonding in a nondefensive way \u2014 I am not hopeful \u2014 then please take it, using the we\u2019re-all-parents-here position. \u201cYou have to say no to your kids sometimes, right, even if it\u2019s just hot stoves and busy streets? So that tells me every good parent-child bond happens despite a lot of saying no. I\u2019d argue because of it. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d Just two parents talking, not parent dictating to child about parent dictating to child. It may seem counterintuitive to ask when you most want to tell, but defensiveness says she already (rightly or wrongly) feels cornered. You\u2019d best leave her room to get out.\n\nDear Carolyn: I have a full-time job and try to do extra freelance artwork as I can, usually after work. My wife is a stay-at-home grandma watching the grandkids, the 10-month-old all day and the 3-year-old when she gets out of school. I'm sure that is not easy.\n\nAD\n\nBut she will give me a call about something else and always throw in, \"What's your ETA?\" If I say I need to get something done, she'll counter with something like, well I've had a stressful day, these kids . . . then I feel guilty and go home.\n\nAD\n\nI've got nothing to hide; there's no other woman, I'm not stopping for beers on the way home, but I'd be a little more bohemian.\n\n\u2014 Drawing a Blank\n\nDrawing a Blank: I\u2019m sure you would like to be, understandably.\n\nAs would I.\n\nAs would, I\u2019m guessing, your wife. Who is on her second go-round at one of the most exhausting jobs there is.\n\nAre you \u201csure that is not easy,\u201d by the way, because you shared the workload with her equally of raising your kid(s), or are you at least somewhat projecting?\n\nAD\n\nMaybe your wife volunteered for this against your wishes. Maybe you both failed to account for the variable of being older. Regardless, the fact of your marriage has you in this together. Don\u2019t prioritize your concern over hers: You both want some freedom. And deserve some. Bring it up when you\u2019re ready to see that.\n\nWrite to Carolyn Hax at tellme@washpost.com.
