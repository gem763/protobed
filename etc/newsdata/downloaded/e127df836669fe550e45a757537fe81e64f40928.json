It is also the position of the central government (in Beijing) that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own.\n\n\"But if the situation becomes so bad, then no options can be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance.\"\n\nMASK BAN BACKLASH\n\nMs Lam has faced widespread criticism over her decision to ban face masks - ubiquitous in Hong Kong since a deadly Sars outbreak in 2003 - and thousands of Hong Kongers flouted the prohibition during an unsanctioned mass march on Sunday.\n\nSo far two people - a male university student and a 38-year-old woman - have been charged with illegally wearing masks, and supporters wore their own face coverings during a court appearance on Monday.\n\nThe two were charged with unlawful assembly, which carries up to three years' jail time, and with defying the mask ban, which has a maximum one-year sentence. Both were released on bail.\n\nMs Lam told journalists it was \"too early\" to say whether the anti-mask law was effective or not.\n\n\"I'm sure you'll agree that for any new policy or new legislation, it will take time to be effectively implemented,\" she said.\n\nMs Lam also would not be drawn on a suggestion by one of her cabinet members, the veteran pro-Beijing politician Ip Kwok-him, that Hong Kong may curb access to the internet in a bid to contain the protests.\n\nThe leader insisted she was \"very committed\" to using political, legal and policy instruments, including dialogue, to address some of the \"deep-seated problems\" in the city.\n\nThirteen of the city's subway stations remained closed on Tuesday following the widespread vandalism and the operator said the entire network would close at 8pm (1200 GMT).\n\nAccording to Hospital Authority figures, ten of the 13 people admitted to hospital over the weekend were in a stable condition on Tuesday while three had been discharged.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] Hong Kong's under-fire leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she would not rule out accepting help from mainland China in tackling increasingly violent pro-democracy protests. .
