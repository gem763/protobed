They have criticized House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for not holding a formal authorization vote, for conducting closed-door depositions and for denying the president the due process afforded in formal criminal proceedings.\n\nNone of these objections hold up. Even so, Democrats aim to address them with the provisions of the resolution they will consider on Thursday.\n\nCentral to the resolution\u2019s ambitions are ensuring order, transparency and fairness as the inquiry moves to the public stage. Rules are being set for conducting public hearings (including who gets to question whom and for how long), publicly disclosing depositions and issuing subpoenas. Guidelines have been established for the participation of Mr. Trump and his lawyers and the transfer of evidence from other committees to the Judiciary Committee, where any articles of impeachment would be considered. The rules providing for the minority party to call its own witnesses are basically the same as those set by Republicans during the Clinton impeachment.\n\nIndeed, many of the procedures outlined in the resolution, and in a related set of procedures drawn up by the Judiciary Committee, are in line with those followed in the impeachment inquiries in 1974 and 1998. These include the president receiving copies of all evidentiary material; the president and his counsel being invited to all hearings; and his counsel being permitted to ask questions at the presentation of evidence, submit evidence on the president\u2019s behalf, question witnesses, object to the questioning of witnesses and so on.\n\nPerhaps the most notable departure from precedent is a provision concerning the Judiciary Committee stipulating that if the president \u201cunlawfully\u201d refuses to make witnesses or evidentiary material available to the investigating committees, \u201cthe chair shall have the discretion to impose appropriate remedies, including by denying specific requests by the president or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses.\u201d", "description": "Democrats get serious about the next phase of inquiry.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/opinion/30resolution-2/30resolution-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
