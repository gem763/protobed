He was 58.\n\nHis brother and manager, Dick, said Mr. Johnston had been in a hospital with kidney problems and was released a day before his death \u201cfeeling good and everything,\u201d when he apparently suffered a heart attack overnight.\n\nMr. Johnston had manic depression and schizophrenia and faced increasing health problems in recent years, notably diabetes and hydrocephalus, a buildup of fluid in the brain. Although he said he hoped to continue performing, he embarked in 2017 on what was billed as his \u201cfinal tour,\u201d joined by a backing band that included members of Wilco, Fugazi and Built to Spill \u2014 a roster of indie rock all-stars that spoke to his reputation as a master lyricist and intimate, uninhibited singer.\n\nWith a high-pitched voice and mild lisp, Mr. Johnston bared his soul in folksy songs about unrequited love, existential dread, his affection for the Beatles and the thrills of a speeding motorcycle. Emerging on Austin\u2019s underground music scene in the mid-1980s, he used a $59 Sanyo boombox to record himself on acoustic guitar, organ and piano, and released cassette tapes decorated with his own ink and marker artwork.\n\nIn \u201cGrievances,\u201d the first song from his self-released debut, \u201cSongs of Pain\u201d (1981), he introduced the character of a young woman named Laurie, who rejected his advances and married an undertaker. \u201cI saw you at the funeral,\u201d Mr. Johnston sang. \u201cYou were standing there like a temple. I said \u2018Hi, how are you, hello,\u2019 and I pulled up a casket and crawled in.\u201d\n\nHis music was unabashedly simple and straightforward \u2014 \u201cthe amazing thing is half these songs are the same three chords,\u201d Built to Spill musician Doug Martsch once said \u2014 but drew a cult following, notably after Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was photographed in a T-shirt bearing the cover of Mr. Johnston\u2019s album \u201cHi, How Are You\u201d (1983).\n\n\n\nAfter his death, mourners visited a \u201cHi, How Are You\u201d mural created by Mr. Johnston in Austin. (Nick Wagner/AP)\n\n\u201cThese songs are recorded so intimately, it almost feels like an invasion to listen to them,\u201d wrote music critic Sasha Geffen, in a Pitchfork list that ranked \u201cHi, How Are You\u201d the 145th best record of the 1980s. \u201cHe sang these earnest, infectious melodies to himself, into a cheap cassette recorder,\u201d she added, \u201cbut he knew exactly how to reach people across time \u2014 to make them feel that, for the duration of a three-minute pop song, they weren\u2019t on their own in this world.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnston was covered by Tom Waits, Beck and Lana Del Rey, collaborated with singer Jad Fair of Half Japanese and guitarist Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers, and was the subject of a 2005 documentary, \u201cThe Devil and Daniel Johnston,\u201d that earned filmmaker Jeff Feuerzeig a directing award at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nHe also found some success as an artist, inking cartoonlike drawings of an \u201calien frog\u201d with eyes like lollipops, a boxer with a hollow head like an empty bowl, and Casper the Friendly Ghost. More than a dozen of his pictures were exhibited at the 2006 Whitney Biennial in Manhattan, after he had previously used his drawings to barter for comic books in Austin, or simply given them away.\n\nBut Mr. Johnston never quite achieved the mainstream success that he said he wanted \u2014 only one of his approximately 20 full-length albums, \u201cFun\u201d (1994), was released by a major label \u2014 and seemed at times to have a loose grasp on what fame he did receive. When asked whether he was planning to travel from Texas to New York for the Whitney show, he told a New York Times reporter he was \u201cnot in any condition to go overseas.\u201d\n\nFor many years, he was in and out of mental institutions and psychiatric wards, and lived with his elderly parents in Waller, working out of a garage filled with horror-movie posters, VHS tapes and comic books. He refused to sign with Elektra Records because he believed its band Metallica was trying to harm him, and addressed his mental-health issues in songs such as \u201cPeek a Boo,\u201d singing: \u201cJunior high I lost my mind; I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s a terrible thing. Since that day it\u2019s been a struggle, trying to make sense out of scrambled eggs.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Johnson in 2010, performing in Bourges, France.

You listen to his songs and it\u2019s like he\u2019s diagnosing himself out of the DSM4 psychology manual.\u201d\n\nThe youngest of five children, Daniel Dale Johnston was born into a Christian fundamentalist family in Sacramento on Jan. 22, 1961. His mother worked on airplanes during World War II before becoming a homemaker, and his father was a fighter pilot turned engineer, who occasionally flew his children on a private plane.\n\nDuring one such flight, in 1990, Mr. Johnston \u201cwas in a psychotic state, took the keys out of the ignition and threw them out of the window,\u201d his brother recalled by phone. \u201cDad was able to get the plane down and they survived.\u201d\n\nThe family moved to New Cumberland, W.Va., when Daniel was young, and frequently gathered around the piano to sing church music. Daniel soon began banging out songs of his own, composing what he later described as \u201chorror-movie themes\u201d before singing more ambitious material while mowing the lawn as a teenager.\n\nHe recorded songs in the cellar and, after graduating high school, attended occasional art classes across the Ohio River, at Kent State University at East Liverpool. He moved to Houston in 1983, worked as a ride operator at the AstroWorld amusement park, sold corn dogs in a traveling carnival and eventually settled in Austin, taking a job at McDonald\u2019s before launching his music career.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d make it with the music that much,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cI thought I was going to be famous as a cartoonist.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his brother, survivors include three sisters.\n\nWhile Mr. Johnston\u2019s songs \u201cTrue Love Will Find You in the End\u201d and \u201cSome Things Last a Long Time\u201d have become much-covered staples of indie rock, he said he was still trying to write a breakout song. \u201cHopefully, I could have a big hit someday, a real hit,\u201d he told the Times in 2017. \u201cI can\u2019t stop writing. If I did stop, there could be nothing. Maybe everything would stop. So I won\u2019t stop. I\u2019ve got to keep it going.\u201d", "description": "He struggled with mental-health issues but found admirers of his music in Kurt Cobain and Tom Waits.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1ch4k0kYBWUXYxWK3BcfHUK2iUs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NSUIGHWVNII6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
