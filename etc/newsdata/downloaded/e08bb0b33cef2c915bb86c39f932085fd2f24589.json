A Primary Challenger Wants Her Current One.", "language": "en", "text": "As she makes a long shot bid for president, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is facing a serious threat at home: a primary challenger who has raised more money and received more high-profile endorsements than she has.\n\nHawaii state Sen. Kaiali\u2019i Kahele (D) launched his primary bid against Gabbard, who has represented the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District since 2013, in January.\n\nHe believed her absence from the district she is representing and her sometimes polarizing stances \u2014 Gabbard only belatedly and seemingly reluctantly supported an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, for example, and drew criticism earlier this year after she refused to condemn Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2014 would give him an opening.\n\n\u201cWhat I really think is important is that we have leaders that are decisive, have some resolve, and are not motivated one way or another to go where the political trade winds blow,\u201d Kahele told HuffPost, alluding to Gabbard.\n\nIn the first two quarters of 2019, Kahele raised $399,000 in campaign contributions, more than quadruple Gabbard\u2019s $83,000. Three former Hawaii governors have endorsed him. And there are signs of trouble for Gabbard: A recent Public Policy Polling survey found that a majority of District 2 constituents support her dropping out of the congressional race altogether. In the same poll, she led Kahele 48 to 26 in a head-to-head matchup, but the fact that 27% of voters in the district were undecided shows that he has a clear path to victory in next year\u2019s primary.\n\n\u201cConstituents do not feel that local or national offices are responsive to their concerns, or available when they need them,\u201d Kahele claimed. \u201cMy first and foremost concern is to make sure that the people of [our district] are well represented.\u201d\n\n\u2018Putting The Priorities Of Hawaii\u2019s Residents First\u2019\n\nKahele, who goes by a Kai, a nickname based on his first name, joined the state Senate in 2016 at age 42. A Hilo-based commercial pilot and Air National Guard major, he hadn\u2019t envisioned getting into politics so young. But \u201cunfortunate circumstances presented an incredible opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nIn early 2016, Kahele\u2019s father, the late state Sen. Gil Kahele, suffered a heart attack. Fighting for his life, Gil asked Kai for one thing: to take over his seat in the state\u2019s first district. Kai agreed. Two days later, his father died.\n\nGov. David Ige appointed Kai to the state Senate in February 2016. He finished out his late father\u2019s term, then ran two successful campaigns in 2016 and 2018, winning each with close to 90% of the vote.\n\nKahele believes he\u2019d do a better job than Gabbard has serving Hawaii\u2019s diverse 2nd Congressional District, which is made up of several islands \u2014 some big and booming, others small and rural. The district encompasses all of the Hawaiian islands except for the southern half of Oahu, where Honolulu has its own representative.\n\nJustin Sullivan via Getty Images Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) takes the stage at a debate in July.\n\nSome of the most pressing issues in the district are education access and health care for veterans and rural communities on those neighboring islands. Despite its annual rankings as one of the country\u2019s healthiest states, rural Hawaiians struggle to access health care, with only 14 rural hospitals across the entire state.\n\nKahele witnessed the lack of access after his father\u2019s heart attack in 2016, when Gil Kahele had to be taken in a medevac helicopter from the Big Island to the island of Oahu because the local medical centers couldn\u2019t accommodate the procedure he needed. Like many candidates in a post-2016 political landscape, Kahele said he\u2019s running on a platform of unity: \u201cbringing teamwork and collaboration to the Hawaii delegation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have four out of 535 members in Congress, 5,000 miles away ... We need a delegation that\u2019s working together, that\u2019s putting the priorities of Hawaii\u2019s residents first.\u201d\n\nThat includes working across the aisle: \u201cWe should all be Americans first,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s An Impeachable Offense\u2019\n\nBut Kahele doesn\u2019t plan on participating in both-sides-ism. He\u2019s seized on Gabbard\u2019s past resistance to an impeachment inquiry, and he\u2019s hammering her on it.\n\nFor months, Gabbard said she would not support an impeachment inquiry, calling it \u201cterribly divisive\u201d \u2014 even after a whistleblower alleged that Trump urged Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe news prompted Kahele to respond, tweeting that impeachment wouldn\u2019t \u201ctear this country apart\u201d any more than Trump already has.\n\nSome say impeachment will tear this country apart, I say that Donald Trump has already torn our country apart. He clearly has put his own self-interest & self-profiting above the interests of the American people. It is time for Congress to fulfill it\u2019s constitutional duty. \u2014 Kai Kahele (@kaikahele) September 23, 2019\n\nAfter the whistleblower complaint prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to launch an impeachment inquiry, Democratic support for impeachment shot up to 81%. A few days later, Gabbard backtracked and released a statement in which she begrudgingly supported the inquiry. Kahele said he was glad Gabbard reversed her position.\n\n\u201cI hope it was due to the facts presented, and not about how the trade winds were blowing,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t understand how she hadn\u2019t gotten to that position sooner, he added.\n\n\u201cIt was clear to me from reading the Mueller report, the whistleblower report and Ukraine memo, that the president asked a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political rival and mess with the 2020 elections,\u201d Kahele said. \u201cThat\u2019s an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nGabbard and Kahele have yet to face off publicly \u2015 Hawaii law forbids Gabbard from running for two public positions simultaneously, so she hasn\u2019t yet announced a reelection campaign. She\u2019s given no indication she plans to give up her seat if she doesn\u2019t win the presidential nomination, but Kahele remains optimistic about his campaign efforts. Hawaii has consistently produced one of Trump\u2019s lowest approval ratings \u2014 dipping as low as 29% \u2014 and 65% of registered voters in the state think he should be impeached. The longer Gabbard took to condemn his actions, the more Hawaiians seemed to disapprove of her, too. This isn\u2019t a new problem for Gabbard, either: Her polling numbers among Aloha State voters dropped after she met with Trump prior to his inauguration in 2017.\n\nGabbard did not return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment for this piece.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a fucking tiger on her tail, and she\u2019s gonna be in trouble,\u201d Kai told VICE News in June. (He later apologized for swearing, and said he thought he was speaking off the record.) \u201cIt\u2019s a different Hawaii than what she\u2019s used to, and I\u2019m a completely different candidate than anything she\u2019s ever faced.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a change in the White House,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time for a change in District 2.\u201d", "description": "While Rep.
