He will be seeking to decide who should get the first shot at forming a government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or former Gen. Benny Gantz, leader of a new centrist party, Blue and White.\n\nElected to the largely ceremonial role in 2014 after a long career as a lawmaker with the Likud Party of Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Rivlin has developed a reputation as being above Israel\u2019s fractious politics. He is pushing for a broad coalition of parties from across the political spectrum to run Israel, known as a unity government, though he can\u2019t force any such move.\n\nMr. Rivlin has up to a week-and-a-half to choose a candidate, who then gets up to six weeks to form a government, pointing to an extended period of political uncertainty at a time of rising tension in the Middle East. The vote was the second this year, coming just months after an April election left Mr. Netanyahu unable to form a government.\n\nThe president and other Israeli leaders are urging a swift return to normalcy. Mr. Rivlin will work as quickly as possible to end the political instability, Harel Tobi, the director of the President\u2019s Residence, told Israel\u2019s Army Radio on Friday.\n\nThe difficulty of Mr. Rivlin\u2019s task became clearer on Friday as official results rolled in and Israel\u2019s parties remained hunkered in their blocs.\n\nMr. Gantz declared victory after his party came out of the election with the most seats, with 33, to 31 for Likud, according to near-final results released by the election committee. But Mr. Gantz doesn\u2019t have nearly the number of promises of support as Mr. Netanyahu, who has pledges from right-wing and religious parties that secure him 55 seats, just six short of the 61 needed to form a governing coalition.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman, this election\u2019s kingmaker because he wouldn\u2019t align with anyone, refused Friday to commit his party\u2019s eight seats to Mr. Gantz for now. The Joint List, a union of Arab parties with 13 seats, has also withheld support from Mr. Gantz, so far.\n\nMr. Rivlin has used his public pulpit to speak against Israel\u2019s increasing \u201ctribalization\u201d into four groups\u2014Arab, secular, ultra-Orthodox and the nationalist religious\u2014who hold separate values and rarely interact.\n\nIn a sign of the respect for Mr. Rivlin, he has support among both backers of annexing the West Bank and Arab leaders who say he is among the few right-wing officials who shows concern for Israel\u2019s Arab citizens.\n\nMr. Rivlin nominated Mr. Netanyahu to lead the government in 2015 and 2019, but he has also expressed worry about Israeli society growing increasingly divisive under the prime minister\u2019s stewardship.\n\nThough Blue and White won the most seats and Mr. Netanyahu had the most commitments, Mr. Rivlin\u2019s job goes beyond judging who has the most pledges or the largest party, Mr. Tobi said.\n\n\u201cHe will choose the candidate who is most likely to form a government,\u201d Mr. Tobi said.\n\nThe president hinted Thursday that he would prefer a unity government joining Likud and Blue and White. Gideon Rahat, a professor at Hebrew University and director of the political reform program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said he believes Mr. Rivlin will try to push Messrs. Gantz and Netanyahu to agree to form a unity government with a rotation of the prime minister\u2019s seat.\n\nMr. Gantz has said he won\u2019t serve with Mr. Netanyahu as long as the prime minister faces indictment on bribery and fraud charges, allegations the prime minister denies.\n\n\u201cBecause he has a role in deciding who to nominate and form a government, Rivlin has an important say here,\u201d said Mr. Rahat. \u201cHe can pressure them by saying in the name of the people, we don\u2019t want third elections, the people say they want a unity government.\u201d\n\nMr. Rivlin is expected to wrap up talks with the parties by Wednesday and then will have one week to choose a potential future prime minister. If that candidate fails, Mr. Rivlin would give a different candidate 28 days to form a government. If talks fail again, elections would be called unless 61 lawmakers come together and choose a leader.", "description": "The task of breaking Israel\u2019s election deadlock falls to President Reuven Rivlin, a grandfatherly national figure who has called for unity but faces an uphill battle as all sides dig in.", "authors": ["Dov Lieber", "Dov.Lieber Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109298/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
