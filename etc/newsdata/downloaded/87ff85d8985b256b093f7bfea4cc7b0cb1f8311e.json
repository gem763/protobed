That was four days before his plane arrived at Teterboro Airport on July 6 in the late afternoon.\n\nEpstein was not officially arrested however until July 8 according to records from the US Marshals Service that were obtained by DailyMail.com.\n\nThe FBI declined to confirm or deny Gabriel's claims while an NYPD spokesperson and the executors of Epstein's estate did not respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nFinal mug: Jeffrey Epstein told his butler that he would be arrested prior to FBI agents apprehending him at Teterboro Airport back in July (Epstein in US Marshalls photos taken after his arrest)\n\nPied-a-phile: Gabriel had been working for Epstein for 18 years, and after his arrest moved into the pedophiles $8 million apartment at no 22 Avenue Foch (above)\n\nIt is also not clear if Epstein learned about his arrest before or after federal agents and members of the NYPD had moved in on his Upper East Side property.\n\nEpstein has a history of leaving his residences spotless ahead of criminal searches, which is why it seems unlikely the FBI would have alerted him to the fact that US Marshalls were awaiting his arrival at Teterboro Aiport.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police learned this back in 2005 when they raided Epstein's mansion only to find that computers and hard drives had gone missing or been wiped clean.\n\nMultiple sources tell DailyMail.com that Epstein was aware that he was being investigated, but he did not seem to be aware the extent of the criminal probe launched by federal prosecutors.\n\nTwo of those individuals also added that Epstein did truly believe he would be immune to any charges that prosecutors might try and charge him with because of that sweetheart plea deal he agreed too back in 2007 in Palm Beach.\n\nIt is believed that this was done to protect Epstein famous friends, who Gabriel spoke about at length once again in this new interview.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates loved his souffle he said, while Steve Bannon came to stay with Epstein while meeting with Marianne Le Pen in the French capital.\n\nGabriel specifically remembers Bannon, saying his visit came last Fall and noting; 'I was even his driver in Paris.'\n\nDailyMail.com reached out to a publicist for Bill and Melinda, who did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGates has been adamant however in the past that he had no personal relationship with the pedophile, though the two did spend time together.\n\nA source close to Bannon meanwhile said it never happened.\n\n'I served crowned heads, diplomats, businessmen and politicians,' said the butler, who noted that Prince Andre and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak were also guests at the residence.\n\nThere was the revolving door of very young, very thin and very tall girls.\n\nThose girls, who Gabriel said all looked to be of age, were kept separate from the other guests at all times according to the butler.\n\nJe t'aime\u2026 moi non plus: Jeffrey Epstein chats with Jean-Luc Brunel (center) while Ghislaine Maxwell and Emmy Tayler (right) look on in a photo taken by Virginia Roberts in Paris circa 2002\n\nParis was one of Epstein's favorite places for the final few decades of his life.\n\nFew photos exist of his time the City of Lights, but there is one image taken by one of his accusers that shows the pedophile and Ghislaine Maxwell as they walk through Paris.\n\nThat photo and others were part of a trove of documents that were released earlier this month from the defamation case Roberts brought against Maxwell.\n\nAlso in the photo, which was taken circa 2002 by Virginia Roberts, is Jean-Luc Brunel.\n\nA lawyer for Brunel said that he is willing to cooperate with officials in Paris who are investigating his former friend and business partner Epstein.\n\nProsecutors in Paris are looking into possible charges of rape and sexual assault against Epstein, both for crimes that he allegedly committed on French soil, as well as ones that he may have committed in other countries involving French citizens.\n\nBrunel's attorney Corinne Dreyfus-Schmidt denied that he is 'on the run' and said that he has made himself available to authorities ever since the launch of this latest probe.\n\n'Before even the preliminary investigation was launched, he made contact with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office, informing it that he remained at the disposal of the authorities,' said the attorney.\n\nThose same prosecutors are also looking into Brunel after three women came forward to allege that they were sexually assaulted or harassed by the Frenchman.\n\nPolice began their probe into Brunel shortly after receiving a letter from a former Dutch model, Thysia Huisman, who said that Brunel spiked her drink and then raped her in his apartment just days after the teenager moved to Paris and signed with his agency, Karin Models.\n\nHuisman said that she was aware the statute of limitations had lapsed for her to press charges against Brunel for rape, but urged authorities to look into Brunel and his businesses.\n\nThe office of Karin Models was raided last month by authorities.", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein knew that federal agents were preparing to arrest him when he returned to the United States back in July.
