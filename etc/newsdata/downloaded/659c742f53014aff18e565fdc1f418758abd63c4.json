However, Colombian ex-President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana said Epstein traveled to Cuba on Castro's invitation, the Miami Herald reported, adding that the trip likely took place in 2003.\n\nA trove of famous and high-profile names surrounded Epstein over the years, including President Trump and former President Bill Clinton.\n\nA 2002 New York Magazine article quoted Trump saying of Epstein, \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d\n\nHowever, court papers dated to 2011 showed that Trump was said to have kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for sexually assaulting a girl there.\n\nTOP DEMS DEMAND ACOSTA RESIGN OVER EPSTEIN DEAL, AS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FIGHTS BACK\n\nIn July, the Trump administration downplayed Trump's connections to Epstein. White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump told her he hadn't spoken with or seen Epstein in 10 or 15 years.\n\nThe video taken by police inside Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach mansion also showed the house was partially decorated with explicit photos and imagery of young women, Fox News reported Thursday.\n\nEpstein was accused of molesting dozens of underage girls at the Palm Beach mansion and by 2006, investigators had interviewed more than 30 young women \u2013 some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged molestations.\n\nIn the end, prosecutors and Epstein\u2019s lawyers negotiated a then-secret plea deal which led Epstein to serve just 13 months in jail under work-release privileges, allowing him to work in his office six days a week.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a child prostitution charge and registered as a sex offender.\n\nPOLICE VIDEO FROM JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S FLORIDA MANSION APPEARS TO SHOW PICTURES, SOME TOPLESS, OF GHISLAINE MAXWELL\n\nOne photograph seen in Epstein's Palm Beach home appeared to show his then-girlfriend and alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, topless on a beach. Maxwell also appeared to be the other person in the foreground of the photo with Castro.\n\nThe socialite, 57, allegedly recruited girls to satisfy Epstein's sexual appetites, according to lawsuits filed by accusers of the financier, who killed himself last month while in jail awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nOne of Epstein\u2019s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, said in a lawsuit she was working at Mar-a-Lago at the age of 15 when Maxwell approached her about a way to earn money: Learn massage therapy and get to know Epstein as a man who could give her a bright future.\n\nIn a sworn affidavit, Giuffre said she was flown on Epstein\u2019s private planes to his properties in New Mexico, the U.S, Virgin Island, Paris and New York. Guiffre also said Maxwell arranged meetings for sex in London and elsewhere with Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew.\n\nPRINCE ANDREW EMAILS WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN LIKELY TO DRAW FBI INTEREST: REPORT\n\nAndrew has said the charges were false and Buckingham Palace has denied any wrongdoing by the prince. At least one photo in court records showed Prince Andrew with his arm around Giuffre\u2019s waist with Maxwell smiling in the background.\n\nLate last month, Andrew broke his silence on Epstein to deny ever witnessing any of the convicted sex offender\u2019s criminal behavior during the \u201climited time\u201d they spent together.\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN FLORIDA MANSION POLICE VIDEO SHOWS MASSAGE TABLES ALLEGEDLY USED FOR SEX ACTS WITH MINORS\n\nHe said in a statement that their friendship began in 1999 and that it was a \u201cmistake and an error\u201d to see Epstein in 2010. That visit took place a year after Epstein had finished serving time in prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nVideo footage surfaced last month showing Andrew waving goodbye to a young woman at the door of Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion during that now-notorious 2010 visit.\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN'S ECCENTRIC, EXPLICIT TASTE IN ART SEEN IN PALM BEACH MANSION RAID VIDEO\n\nMaxwell also has denied Guiffre\u2019s claims and the others in court documents, saying in 2011, \u201cThe allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and I ask that they stop.\u201d\n\nThe elusive former associate of Epstein, who has not been charged with any crime, has said nothing publicly since Epstein\u2019s death, and could not be reached for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFederal prosecutors confirmed last week that inquiries into Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators were ongoing and would continue despite the fact that the criminal case against Epstein has been dismissed now that he's dead.\n\nFox News\u2019 Bryan Llenas, Tamara Gitt, Robert Gearty and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Video from a 2005 police raid at convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Florida mansion showed an array of photos on display \u2013 one of which\u00a0appeared to show Epstein and\u00a0Pope John Paul II, with another depicting\u00a0Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
