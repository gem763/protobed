But he couldn't spearhead a game-winning drive once UGA took over on downs with 34 seconds left.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS:Highs and lows from Week 7 in college football\n\nSOONERS SHINE:No. 5 Oklahoma with stingy defense prove too much for Texas\n\nNEAR-COLLAPSE:No. 16 Michigan takes huge lead before holding off Illinois\n\nFromm(295 yards on 28-for-51 passing) struggled to drive UGA's offense before the last drive of regulation, making several costly turnovers \u2014 one being an interception that turned into the first pick-6 of his career at the end of the second quarter. That score, an Israel Mukuamu 53-yard return, broke a 10-10 tie to give the Gamecocks a 17-10 lead \u2014 and the game's momentum \u2014 heading into halftime. Fromm threw another pick early in the fourth quarter as the Bulldogs were trying to mount a comeback, and it was Mukuamu again who caused the turnover. Mukuamu also picked off Fromm in overtime.\n\n\u201cNot as clean as I want it to be,\u201d Fromm said. \u201cThere were definitely some turnovers and some incompletions. We should have played more clean. That\u2019s part of it and you wish we had just executed better on offense.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina coach Will Muschamp entered Saturday's contest with a stellar game plan, and his team's defense came up clutch with several sacks on Fromm and momentum-determining plays. The Gamecocks forced a fumble at the beginning of the fourth quarter and also deflected a field goal attempt by Blankenship right before the half.\n\n\u201cThat was a great college football game, and you hate for anyone to lose in that situation, especially the way it happened,\u201d Muschamp said, referring to Blankenship\u2019s final miss. \u201cMy heart goes out to him in losing in that fashion.\u201d\n\nIt was a humbling loss for Georgia, which enter as a 24-point favorite and will likely now need to finish without another loss in the SEC to make the College Football Playoff. Before the resume-staining loss, the Bulldogs had a 46% chance of reaching the playoff.\n\nGeorgia coach Kirby Smart blamed the defeat of the giveaways that plagued his team.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t beat anybody when you have a 4-0 turnover margin,\u201d Smart said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t force any on defense. We didn\u2019t cause any problems on defense and we didn\u2019t take care of the ball.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina had a QB shuffle with redshirt freshman Dakereon Joyner taking over for starter Ryan Hilinski who suffered a knee injury midway through the third quarter.\n\nJoyner finished 6-for-12 passing for 39 yards and also added 28 yards rushing.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "description": "The first major upset of the college football season has happened as South Carolina knocked off No. 3 Georgia in 2OT to shake up the playoff race.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/12/USAT/488f4813-5858-4d33-a97f-2150e591e854-USATSI_13502747.jpg?crop=3982,2240,x0,y144&width=3200&height=2091&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
