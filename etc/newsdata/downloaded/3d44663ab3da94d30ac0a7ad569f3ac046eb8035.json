Trump has invited congressional leaders from both parties.\n\nAD\n\nTrump might get questions earlier in the day about the impeachment inquiry. He is scheduled to hold a joint news conference at noon with visiting Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nAD\n\n7:45 a.m.: Trump suggests he\u2019s facing possible impeachment because the Democratic presidential field is weak\n\nIn a morning tweets, Trump panned the performances of the Democratic presidential candidates in Tuesday night\u2019s debate \u2014 and suggested he is facing an impeachment inquiry because the field is weak.\n\n\u201cYou would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cNow you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe later predicted dire consequences if any of the Democrats prevail.\n\n\u201cOur record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn another tweet, Trump quoted conservative cable host Graham Ledger calling the impeachment inquiry a \u201cConstitutional Travesty\u201d and said he is the wrong politician to target.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to the House Intelligence Committee chairman and the House speaker, both California Democrats. Members of Congress cannot be impeached.\n\nTrump also echoed the arguments of his Republican allies who have spent more time attacking the impeachment process than defending Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRepublicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n7:30 a.m.: McCarthy ramps up attacks on Pelosi over process\n\nMcCarthy ramped up his attacks Wednesday on Pelosi, arguing that Democrats were treating Trump unfairly during the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a better chance of having a fair judicial system in China than in Speaker Pelosi\u2019s House of Representatives,\u201d McCarthy said during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcCarthy complained that House investigators are taking depositions behind closed doors, that only Democrats can call witnesses and that Trump does not have a lawyer present to cross-examine witnesses.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the depositions, Republican lawmakers and staff are allowed to question witnesses. Democrats have said that they are conducting depositions behind closed doors so that witnesses cannot tailor their accounts to previous testimony.\n\nEarlier this week, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said he expects some witnesses to testify again in open sessions and said transcripts will be released later.\n\nThe process is consistent with House rules but has differed in some respects from previous impeachment inquiries.\n\n\u201cYou know in America you\u2019re innocent until proven guilty until you let the Democrats become in charge,\u201d McCarthy said during his Fox News interview.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n8 a.m.: Former Pompeo adviser to testify about State Department\n\nMcKinley is expected to testify before House investigators leading the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday morning.\n\nHe will come to the Hill with an intimate understanding of how Pompeo wielded power in the highest echelons of the State Department, given his proximity to the top diplomat on his many trips abroad.\n\nThe format for the testimony is a \u201ctranscribed interview,\u201d said a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet made public, which places fewer restrictions on the interview process than in a formal deposition.\n\n\u2014 John Hudson\n\n6:40 a.m.: Trump campaign calls inquiry a \u2018sham\u2019 because of no formal vote\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump campaign seized Wednesday morning on the announcement by Democratic leaders that they still have no plans for a full House vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nIn morning tweets, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Democrats were \u201ctrampling all over due process\u201d and called the ongoing inquiry an \u201cillegitimate, unprecedented sham\u201d and an \u201cillegitimate plot to overthrow a duly elected President.\u201d\n\nIn a news conference Tuesday, Pelosi noted that there is no constitutional requirement for a full House vote to open an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement that we have a vote, and so at this time we will not be having a vote,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nAD\n\nSchiff told reporters that Republicans are calling for a vote because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to discuss the president\u2019s conduct; they would much rather discuss process.\u201d\n\n6 a.m.: Impeachment first topic in Democratic presidential debate\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was the first topic tackled at Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded the first question, on why she believes Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than leaving the issue of Trump\u2019s fitness for office up to the voters to decide next November.\n\nWarren\u2019s response: \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that\u2019s the case with this impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), too, defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u201chas got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.\u201d\n\nBiden \u2013 who only recently came out in favor of impeachment \u2013 called Trump the most corrupt U.S. president in history. He highlighted the White House\u2019s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThey have no choice but to move,\u201d he said of House Democrats.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) echoed her competitors, expressing her support of the impeachment inquiry and adding that she didn\u2019t think the impeachment process would take very long.", "description": "His GOP allies stepped up their attacks on the impeachment inquiry as House committees prepared to hear from another State Department witness central to the Ukraine controversy.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/p3NFVVh74gveUA8LJZjprssO74g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EFR4VFXPR4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
