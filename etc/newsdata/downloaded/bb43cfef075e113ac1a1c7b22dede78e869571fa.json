The team has previously blocked major roads and railway lines but its principal tactic to date has been passive resistance rather than outright confrontation.\n\nPolice said they believed the activists were planning to carry out sabotage and violent attacks on 1 October, the second anniversary of the illegal referendum on independence, to coincide with the sentencing of Catalan politicians for their role in the poll and the subsequent unilateral declaration of independence. The politicians are expected to be sentenced on or around 10 October.\n\nThe arrests were the result of an anti-terrorist investigation that was launched more than a year ago.\n\nCatalan separatists are increasingly divided on how to maintain the impetus of a movement that is gradually losing momentum, with one section calling for dialogue while the other, led by the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and his successor, Quim Torra, calling for \u201cconfrontation\u201d with Madrid.\n\nThe two main grassroots independence organisations, the Catalan National Assembly and \u00d2mnium Cultural, believe direct action would damage the movement\u2019s image, while the CDR has called for active civil disobedience, claiming \u201cliberation doesn\u2019t exist without tension\u201d.\n\nLast year, on the first anniversary of the referendum, Torra was widely criticised for inciting the CDR to cause maximum disruption. The radicals have since turned on the president, claiming he is a traitor to the cause.\n\nIn a tweet, the CDR responded to the arrests with a call for a \u201cunited front\u201d against the \u201ckingdom of Spain\u2019s machinery and repressive forces\u201d, adding that \u201cnothing can stop a committed and combative people\u201d.", "description": "Nine activists linked to network calling for civil disobedience arrested in Barcelona area", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3052feaa907d8be446fa5cd993ea0adc6b2e79d/0_96_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e7f197f7624a6b9d66d1ad7e5e13a430", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
