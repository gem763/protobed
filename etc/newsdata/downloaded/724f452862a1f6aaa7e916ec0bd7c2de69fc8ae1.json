But hardly ever.\n\nThis \u2014 a headline from NPR \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be a question: \u201cWith John Bolton Fired, What\u2019s Next For Trump\u2019s Afghanistan Policy?\u201d\n\nThis \u2014 a headline from NBC News \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be an issue of debate: \u201cU.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan could trigger \u2018catastrophic\u2019 civil war, ex-U.S. diplomats warn.\u201d\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause if America were in the habit of declaring war the good old-fashioned Constitution way \u2014 the good old-fashioned Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution way, where Congress holds the power to declare war \u2014 the fact is the politics of declaring war would more frequently than not be too untenable for office-holders to take. They would keep the peace just to avoid the scrutiny.\n\nA war declaration is a decisive action. It marks an important moment in time, and it carries with it all the necessary explanations to clarify the whos and hows and whens and wheres and, most crucially, the whys.\n\nIt forces the duly elected to be accountable for their reasons and allows the people the chance to test the logic.\n\nIt keeps the president in check and ensures the executive, via the War Powers Act, doesn\u2019t unilaterally step into military missions the people don\u2019t want and the legislators and senators can\u2019t justify.\n\nIt provides the proper forum for deciding the end game \u2014 for determining exactly what must occur for U.S. troops to withdraw.\n\nAccountability. Accountability to the people.\n\nAnd if politicians from both parties, from all walks of political life, can be said to share a common trait, it\u2019s this: They avoid accountability like the dickens.\n\nThe thing is America hasn\u2019t formally declared war since World War II.\n\nWe\u2019ve been in all kinds of conflicts \u2014 all sorts of long-running military occupations \u2014 all manners of U.N.-allied missions. But War with a capital W?\n\n\u201cCongress has declared war on 11 occasions, including its first declaration of war with Great Britain in 1812,\u201d the U.S. Senate\u2019s historical page reports. \u201cCongress approved its last formal declaration of war during World War II.\u201d\n\nThat was against Japan, followed in quick succession against Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (then Rumania). The other U.S. declared wars include the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War and against countries during World War I.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nSince, Congress has ceded its war-making authorities to the president and to the interests influencing the president, all as a way of avoiding the type of hard decisions that should indeed be part and parcel of deciding on war.\n\nSince, millions of brave Americans have died during the course of military service.\n\nAnd since, America\u2019s sort of waffled this way, waffled that way, navigating curvy roads and twisted paths of foreign policy, siding sometimes with this interest, flip-flopping other times with that administration \u2014 but never, ever having the sort of clear-cut reasoning and clarity of mission of war days past. And we\u2019re paying the price for this congressional dereliction of duty.\n\nHow? For one, a properly declared, congressionally funded Afghanistan War of 2001 would not still be an Afghanistan War in 2019.\n\nIt just wouldn\u2019t be. We either would\u2019ve won or lost \u2014 or known the difference.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
