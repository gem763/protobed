[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nOnline travel agencies face stricter supervision under a draft regulation released by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Wednesday that clearly defines their responsibilities.\n\nThe ministry said the online travel market had grown continuously in the past few years, making it easier for people to book tour packages, but the absence of strong supervision over the sector had led to encroachment on consumers' rights.\n\nThe regulation would ban online travel agencies from offering unreasonably cheap tour packages or using big-data analysis to price tour products to the disadvantage of existing customers.\n\nAgencies should also publicize the process of reserving tour packages and travel services to users to make the process more transparent.\n\nAccording to the regulation, agencies should not sell tour packages to users who refuse to provide their real names and ID information.\n\nThe responsibilities of platforms are clearly defined in the regulation. For example, they should sign contracts with users when tour packages are reserved, and they should recommend users purchase insurance before their trips to better ensure their safety.\n\nThe regulation is open for public comment until Nov 10.", "description": "Online travel agencies face stricter supervision under a draft regulation released by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Wednesday that clearly defines their responsibilities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9da8cfa310cf3e97a05667.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
