There are pictures to prove it.", "language": "en", "text": "Freelance Writer\n\nThere\u2019s James Dean, perfect hair and a smirk \u2014 cigarette in one hand, \u201cThe Complete Poetical Works of James Whitcomb Riley\u201d in the other. Audrey Hepburn, a classics connoisseur, is cross-legged on a shag carpet, eyes fixed on the open book in front of her. And Orson Welles is supine, smoking a pipe and focused on a weathered copy of \u201cA History of Technology, Vol. III: From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution.\u201d\n\nStars, they\u2019re just like us! Provided you consume your reading material while draped in a silk robe and posed seductively.\n\nIn \u201cThe Hollywood Book Club,\u201d photo archivist Steven Rea curates 55 photographs of classic film stars \u201cwith literature (or not) in their hands \u2014 or on their laps, or in the general vicinity.\u201d The full-page images \u2014 candid pictures, publicity shots and production stills \u2014 are black-and-white, and they\u2019re stunning: Rita Hayworth and Ginger Rogers are otherworldly; 25-year-old Marlon Brando\u2019s gaze is so smoldering, one worries about the flammable book he\u2019s holding. Each photo is accompanied by just a few lines of text, a simplicity that keeps the focus where it belongs: on the images.\n\nRea groups the photos into categories, including the stars luxuriating in their personal libraries; reading to their kids; studying source material for film interpretations; and passing time on set.\n\n\n\nAngie Dickinson looks at a prop book, \u201cIllustrated Book of Love\u201d on the set of \u201cPretty Maids All in a Row.\u201d (Photo courtesy of Chronicle)\n\nAn eclectic taste in reading is apparently timeless: Sammy Davis Jr. relaxed with a paperback edition of Lloyd C. Douglas\u2019s biblical epic \u201cThe Robe,\u201d and Lauren Bacall perused a pictorial history of 20th-century conflict. John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands read \u201cBaby Animals,\u201d a picture book by Garth Williams, to their son, Nick, who grew up to be an actor and a director.\n\nSome stars used books as props: In a photo from the 1971 film \u201cPretty Maids All in a Row,\u201d Angie Dickinson studied the \u201cIllustrated Book of Love,\u201d a guide to sexual positions. And three Ziegfeld Follies girls \u2014 Mary Jane Halsey, Diana Cook and Edna Callahan \u2014 balanced titles from the MGM library on top of their well-styled heads.\n\nOthers were notably voracious readers. In a 1951 photo, Marilyn Monroe was curled up on a sofa bed, wearing a silk bathrobe and sultry expression while reading \u201cThe Poetry and Prose of Heinrich Heine,\u201d an 874-page collection. Books were stacked on every nearby surface, too \u2014 Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Leo Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d John Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cTortilla Flats.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarry Belafonte on the set of \u201cIsland in the Sun.\u201d The movie includes a monologue about Dostoevsky's \u201cCrime and Punishment.\u201d (Photo courtesy of Chronicle)\n\nIn another photo, Bette Davis, outfitted in stylish riding gear, read a book concealed by a dust jacket. (There\u2019s an ad for a 1930s spiritual movement on the back: \u201cExplore Your Mind!\u201d is visible in bold print.) Davis\u2019s reading habits became the subject of national attention in 1938, when the New York Times reported that her husband wanted a divorce because she read \u201cto an unnecessary degree.\u201d Her fellow stars, one imagines, would have disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe Hollywood Book Club\u201d is a striking collectible, a delight for bibliophiles and cinephiles. The glitz and glamour are palpable, and the photos Rea selected awaken a nostalgia for those golden years of the silver screen. Assume your best movie-star pose, and savor the book on your velvet chaise, leveling its pages with your sauciest gaze. One never knows when a camera is lurking nearby.\n\nAngela Haupt is a freelance writer and full-time health editor in the District.", "description": "In \u201cThe Hollywood Book Club,\u201d Steven Rea brings together photos of Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe and many more.", "authors": ["Angela Haupt", "Freelance Writer", "Angela Haupt Is A Freelance Writer", "Full-Time Health Editor In D.C.
