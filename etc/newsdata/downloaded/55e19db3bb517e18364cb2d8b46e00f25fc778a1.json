We didn\u2019t play well enough, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said Southgate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always maintained there is a lot of work to be done to be a really top team. Tonight was clear evidence of that.\u201d\n\nEngland still top the group thanks to their better head-to-head record with the Czechs on 12 points, but now have work to do in their final three qualifiers, starting with a visit to Bulgaria on Monday.\n\n\u201cTo sail through a qualifying group with no issues is unusual so we have to respond and I expect us to do that,\u201d added Southgate.\n\n\u201cFootball is all about responding to setbacks. We haven\u2019t had too many so it feels even more unpleasant. None of us like it, but that\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nEngland had plundered 19 goals in their first four qualifiers, including a 5-0 thrashing of the Czechs back in March, and another comfortable evening seemed in store when the visitors went in front after just five minutes.\n\nRaheem Sterling sped in behind the Czech defence and as the Manchester City forward cut inside, he was brought down by Lukas Masopust.\n\nFrom the resulting penalty, Kane confidently slotted home for his 27th international goal.\n\nHowever, rather than going onto showcase why they will be among the favourites to win Euro 2020 with an abundance of attacking talent and home advantage on their side for most of the tournament, England showed the defensive frailties that could easily cost them next summer.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Wake-up call\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a wake-up call,\u201d said Kane.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in a good position so there\u2019s no need to panic, but we\u2019ve still got stuff to work on, as you could see tonight.\u201d\n\nThe hosts, ranked 44th in the world, caused problems for the World Cup semi-finalists all night and levelled within four minutes.\n\nEngland\u2019s defending was found wanting twice as Ondrej Celustka won the first header and Brabec bundled the ball in at the back post.\n\nSouthgate had rewarded Mason Mount\u2019s bright start to the season with Chelsea with a first international start.\n\nBut with Mount in an advanced midfield role, Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice were overrun behind him as the Czechs dominated possession.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got to improve without the ball,\u201d added Southgate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ve spoken about all week and we didn\u2019t get the reaction we needed today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the time to look at individuals. I\u2019ve got to get the team back on track for Monday.\u201d\n\nThe half-time break gave Southgate the chance to reshape his midfield and England had chances to win the game as Tomas Vaclik denied Sterling and Kane.\n\nBut Jordan Pickford was also forced into fine saves from Masopust\u2019s dipping effort and Alex Kral\u2019s driven shot behind at the near post as the Czechs continued to threaten.\n\nAnd the Everton goalkeeper was helpless when Masopust broke down the right and crossed for Ondrasek to seal a famous victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m terribly happy I\u2019ve got the chance although I didn\u2019t expect it. It\u2019s incredible,\u201d said the FC Dallas forward Ondrasek.\n\n\u201cI think my dad had tears in his eyes and it was the first time in my life I saw him like this. An incredible night really.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "England manager Gareth Southgate admitted his side still have a long way to go to become a \"top team\" after their first qualifying loss in 10 years on Friday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180482510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
