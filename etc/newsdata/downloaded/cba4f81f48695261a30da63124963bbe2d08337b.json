But the brand has no plans to relocate any manufacturing to China or Asia to be closer to this huge pool of sales, Burke said.\n\n\u201cWhy change a model that\u2019s working beautifully?\u201d he told reporters, adding Asian customers were not interested in products made in the region. Vuitton tends to trade off its \u201cMade in France\u201d cachet.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s based on what our clients are looking for,\u201d he said.\n\nBurke also said the brand aimed to eventually recycle all unsold goods as its fine tunes its manufacturing process to limit excess inventories. It already recycles all metal fixtures and nearly all leather products, he added.\n\nLuxury brands are under pressure from consumers and environmental campaigners over their green credentials, after brands like Britain\u2019s Burberry (BRBY.L) revealed they sometimes destroyed unsold stocks to try to preserve an exclusive image.", "description": "LVMH's Louis Vuitton brand will hire another 1,500 manufacturing staff in France by 2022, as it expands production to meet strong demand in markets like China.", "authors": ["Sarah White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427005612&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851K1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
