These companies are finding ways to digitize life insurance to appeal to consumers \u2014 and they're giving incumbents the opportunity to revamp traditional offerings, either by partnering with them or using their technology.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has forecasted the shifting landscape of life insurance in the The Future of Life Insurance report. Here are the key problems insurtechs are tackling: Business Insider Intelligence\n\nLack of education: Forty percent of US consumers told the Life Insurance and Market Research Association (LIMRA) that they feel intimidated by the life insurance application process, often drastically overestimating its cost and facing uncertainty about how much or which type of coverage to buy.\n\nForty percent of US consumers told the Life Insurance and Market Research Association (LIMRA) that they feel intimidated by the life insurance application process, often drastically overestimating its cost and facing uncertainty about how much or which type of coverage to buy. Inconvenient application process: It can take weeks or months for coverage to take effect because of the sheer number of meetings and parties combing through paperwork in each round of the application process. The risk for the insurer often warrants reviews from the carrier, a team of underwriters, a broker, and even a medical examiner.\n\nIt can take weeks or months for coverage to take effect because of the sheer number of meetings and parties combing through paperwork in each round of the application process. The risk for the insurer often warrants reviews from the carrier, a team of underwriters, a broker, and even a medical examiner. Low customer loyalty: Life insurance tends to be a \"set it and forget it\" type of purchase, with very few people revisiting it after buying. Insurers and consumers therefore have limited contact for most of the relationship \u2014 with the exception of an annual bill, of course.\n\nLife insurance tends to be a \"set it and forget it\" type of purchase, with very few people revisiting it after buying. Insurers and consumers therefore have limited contact for most of the relationship \u2014 with the exception of an annual bill, of course. Inefficient data management and processing: The aggregate data life insurers rely on is typically fed into algorithms that make broad assumptions about particular populations, and often incorporate outdated medical documentation \u2014 all of which can delay applications and result in unnecessary rejections.\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nThe need for modernization in life insurance is clear: Overall sales are slowing and policy ownership is hitting record lows.
