The researchers noted:\n\n\u201cThis campaign\u2019s threat actors saw an opportunity and appear to have carved out a nice niche for themselves. We suspect that this particular threat actor is likely to continue operations, as previous public reporting has not deterred them, therefore we wanted to highlight their new modus operandi, so that network defenders may more easily identify their operations.\u201d\n\nThreats abound for crypto users\n\nThe malware works by arriving as an infected document in a phishing email. If a user opens the document, it would trigger a series of events which would create backdoors to steal any cryptocurrency holdings in associated hot wallets.\n\nThe resurgence in the price of cryptocurrencies this year has led to new threats being detected on an almost weekly basis.\n\nJust last week, cybersecurity experts warned about a new spyware which used encrypted messenger Telegram to replace user wallet addresses with its own.\n\nRecently, major Slovakia-based antivirus software provider ESET has discovered a banking trojan that can steal cryptocurrencies and is especially widespread in Latin America.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, estimates put the total amount raised by cybercriminals this year at $4.3 billion.", "description": "The MasterMana botnet is proving that even budget hackers can achieve considerable success via phishing email scams", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOTU5Y2U0Y2Q1YTIyZWU5NmY2ZTI3MGY1OTQ0ZTZkYTEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
