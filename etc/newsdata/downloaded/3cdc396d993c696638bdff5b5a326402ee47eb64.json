One year we picked up 200 lost, forgotten and discarded items from one beach.\u201d\n\nLouise Edge, head of Greenpeace UK\u2019s ocean plastics campaign, said: \u201cWe urge businesses to think of future generations and to at least halve their plastic footprint by 2025.\u201d\n\nLouise Edge, head of Greenpeace UK\u2019s ocean plastics campaign, said the toy's arrival on the beach should act as a warning.\n\n\u201cThese plastic toys washing up more than 60 years after they were distributed serve as a stark reminder that the decisions big corporates make now will have an impact for decades to come,\" she said.\n\n\u201cIn the 1950s we didn\u2019t know what a damaging impact plastic would have on our planet.\n\n\"But now we know that plastic production contributes to our climate emergency, and plastic pollution like this chokes our oceans and harms wildlife.\n\n\u201cWe urge businesses to think of future generations and to at least halve their plastic footprint by 2025.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Toys made decades ago are finding their way onto Watergate and Whitsand Bay in Cornwall", "authors": ["Nada Farhoud"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642286.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_JS195967371.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
