What they found was terrible \u2013 the way animals are abused during shearing,\u201d Sascha Camilli, Peta European media and projects coordinator told City Press this week.\n\nPeta\u2019s investigations report and a video, which are on its website, tell in gory details how the animals are lifted from the floor by the tail and shearers sit on them as they shear them.\n\n\u201cShearers are paid by volume and not by the hour which pushes them to work fast and carelessly, thereby slashing the animals all over the body. This results in the animals bleeding from all parts of their bodies,\u201d said Camilli.\n\nZara Customer Care told City Press it is \u201cconcerned about the evidence of cruel practices on South African mohair farms uncovered by Peta\u201d.\n\n\u201cFollowing constructive discussions with Peta, Inditex has decided to phase out the small number of products we sell containing mohair and committed that all its products will be completely mohair free by the end of the 2019 winter campaign,\u201d said Zara.\n\n\u201cWe have reminded our suppliers of their obligation to comply with our code of conduct for supplies, which includes our comprehensive animal welfare policy.\u201d\n\nH&M Group also confirmed this week that it had \u201cpermanently banned\u201d mohair.\n\nResponding from Stockholm, Sweden, H&M group press officer I\u00f1igo S\u00e1enz Maestres, said: \u201cFor us it is of utmost importance that animals are treated well and we have decided to ban mohair permanently. We have been in close dialogue with Peta for several years and fully agree with it on this matter.\n\n\u201cH&M Group has an animal welfare policy with strict requirements for all animal-derived materials that we use in our products.\u201d\n\nMohair SA said it viewed the \u201callegations\u201d of animal cruelty \u201cin a very serious light\u201d. However, it denied that production had been stopped.\n\n\u201cReports and the accompanying video led us to an investigation in which two farms were implicated. These farms were suspended from participating in mohair sales pending the outcome of a third-party audit of their farms,\u201d said Riaan Marais, Mohair SA spokesperson.\n\n\u201cWe have taken action and the investigation is still continuing.\u201d\n\nMohair generates R1.5 billion in foreign currency, exports 3.5 million kilograms of mohair (50% of the world\u2019s supply) and has about 30 000 people who directly or indirectly depend on the industry.\n\n* SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE UPDATE: Get Fin24's top morning business news and opinions in your inbox.", "description": "As Mohair SA intensifies its investigation into the gruesome abuse of animals, particularly goats during shearing, two Karoo farms have already been suspended from participating in mohair sales.", "authors": ["Max Matavire"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2376/070fe8d54f4d48b593703c2a3fc5246d.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-20"}
