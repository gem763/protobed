Conor Hourihane, in the thick of the action throughout, had given away the free-kick with a foul on Martin Montoya. He protested his innocence to no avail.", "description": "A stoppage-time goal by defender Matt Targett claimed three points for Villa after Brighton had battled manfully against the odds when a first-half red card for Aaron Mooy had obliged them to play for 55 minutes with 10 men.", "authors": ["Jon Culley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213510924-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkOwR0iP77jSmoq9t8DUmdkI5PVhohuSlWJ3WDmdJlS4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
