After the recent earnings disappointment from Netflix, he suggested swapping that stock for Microsoft (MSFT) .\n\nIn this daily bar chart of MSFT, below, we can see that prices have been stuck in a relatively tight five-month trading range. Prices have crisscrossed the 50-day moving average line a number of times. The slower 200-day moving average line is rising and well below the current price of MSFT.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has drifted ever so slightly lower the past three months or so suggesting some light distribution (selling).\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been hovering near the zero line for a few months but it should be quick to respond on the upside if price rally.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MSFT, below, we can see a mostly bullish alignment of the indicators. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is pointed higher and bullish while the MACD oscillator has been above the zero line for some time but now is in a temporary take profits mode.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MSFT, below, we can see a long uptrend with a potential price target of $181 being projected.\n\nBottom line strategy: The charts and indicators of MSFT appear bullish so swapping NFLX for MSFT looks like a good idea. Go long MSFT at current levels risking to $130 while targeting $181 or higher.", "description": "Let's take a look at the charts of MSFT....FB", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Microsoft Is Ready To Rally To New Heights", "Let'S Take A Look At The Charts Of Msft.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Maleeha Bengali", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/microsoftscreen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
