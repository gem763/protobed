The whole thing would be almost comical if we weren\u2019t talking about human lives here.\u201d\n\nOpioids, including painkillers like OxyContin and street drugs like heroin and fentanyl, have been blamed for more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. in the last two decades.\n\nThe Sacklers have agreed to put in $3 billion, plus up to $1.5 billion from the sale of their Mundipharma business, which sells opioids around the world.\n\nThe tentative multibillion-dollar settlement with Purdue Pharma would raise money to help clean up the opioid mess by ... selling more OxyContin.\n\nIt\u2019s one reason two dozen states have rejected the deal.\n\n\u201cThe settlement agreement basically requires the settlement payments to be made based on the future sales and profits of opioids. That doesn\u2019t really feel to me like the right way to do this,\u201d Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said this week.\n\nMassachusetts is among several states that have pledged to continue pushing back in court against the company and especially members of the Sackler family, which owns Purdue. On Tuesday, North Carolina became the latest state to sue the Sacklers.\n\nStamford, Connecticut-based Purdue, cast as a major villain in the opioid crisis in some 2,600 lawsuits brought by state, local and tribal governments, hospitals, unions and others, filed for bankruptcy Sunday in the first step toward putting the settlement into effect.\n\nPURDUE PHARMA'S SACKLER FAMILY USED HIDDEN ACCOUNTS TO TRANSFER $1B: COURT DOCS\n\nUnder the deal, valued by Purdue at potentially more than $10 billion over time, the Sacklers would give up ownership of the company, and it would be reconstituted as a \u201cpublic benefit trust.\u201d Its profits from opioids, as well as from overdose antidotes and addiction-treatment drugs, would go toward the settlement.\n\nWhile OxyContin and other prescription drugs like it have what are widely accepted as legitimate medical uses \u2014 namely, relieving severe pain \u2014 activists and others are troubled by the prospect of the continued sale of Purdue\u2019s opioids in the U.S. and overseas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d Ed Bisch, who was among the first parents to take on Purdue, told AP. His son died of an OxyContin overdose at 18 in 2001. \u201cIf they keep on selling OxyContin, there\u2019s going to be more and more accidental addicts.\u201d\n\nKey lawyers for the local governments have agreed to the tentative deal, as have 24 states, which envision using the money for addiction treatment programs, among other purposes. Twenty-four other states have rejected the settlement. A federal bankruptcy judge can decide whether to approve it, reject it or ask for changes.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time continuing sales of a troublesome product were used to fund a settlement over its toll. More than 20 years ago, the big tobacco companies settled with the states in a deal that partially based their payments on cigarette sales.\n\nThose payments continue to this day. By last year, the master settlement with 46 states had resulted in a payout of $126 billion, with continuing payments of $9 billion a year. As part of the settlement, the tobacco companies agreed to tough restrictions on the use of cartoon characters, product giveaways and billboards.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPrescription opioids are often given to cancer patients in severe pain at the end of their lives and people who have been in accidents or undergone surgery.\n\nIf Purdue stopped selling opioids, it might not have a big effect on the supply of the drugs nationally. The company accounts for only a small slice of the market; the vast majority of the opioid pills sold are generics.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The tentative multibillion-dollar settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma would raise money to help clean up the opioid mess by ... selling more OxyContin.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
