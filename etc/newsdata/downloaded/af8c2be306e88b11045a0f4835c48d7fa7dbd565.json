We went with that?\"\n\n\"There are some that are better than others,\" he said.\n\nKauffman added: \"It's much harder for me to enjoy the good moments when there are moments in it where I'm going, 'Oh my God, we let that happen? We did that.'\"\n\nCrane added: \"We couldn't stay 10 more minutes and just find a better joke?\n\n\"But that's just us beating ourselves up.\"\n\nRead more:\n\n'Friends' star Lisa Kudrow struggled with playing Phoebe, and credits costar Matt LeBlanc with helping her through it\n\nLisa Kudrow says she felt like a 'mountain' next to 'Friends' costars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox\n\nCourtney Cox posted a throwback photo of the 'Friends' cast on board a private jet to Vegas before the show had even aired, and celebrity fans are loving it", "description": "\"The One With The Chicken Pox\" is one of cocreator Marta Kauffman's big regrets when it comes to \"Friends.\"", "authors": ["Alison Millington"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d80ae56f4fc24705e73b4a9-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
