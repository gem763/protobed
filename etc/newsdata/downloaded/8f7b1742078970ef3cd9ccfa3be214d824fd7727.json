Katie Hill (D-CA) released a statement on Monday formally announcing her resignation following allegations of inappropriate sexual relationships with congressional staffers, blaming \u201cright-wing media\u201d and \u201chateful political operatives\u201d for \u201cenabling and perpetuating my husband\u2019s abuse by providing him a platform.\u201d\n\nHill confirmed the reports of her resignation in a video announcement released Monday. Her resignation comes weeks after mounting allegations of inappropriate sexual relationships with congressional staffers, including a \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with a female staffer and a separate affair with a male staffer.\n\nWhile Hill issued a relatively ambiguous statement confirming a relationship with a staffer the day after denying an affair with a male member of her congressional staff, she directly blamed her departure on a \u201ccoordinated campaign carried out by the right-wing media and Republican opponents,\u201d accusing both of \u201cenabling and perpetuating my husband\u2019s abuse by providing him a platform\u201d and calling it \u201cdisgusting and unforgivable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will be held accountable, but I will not allow myself to be a distraction from the constitutional crisis we\u2019re faced with and the critical work of my colleagues, and so I have to take my personal fight outside the halls of Congress,\u201d she said, stressing the importance of legislative policies \u2014 ensuring \u201cquality health care, housing we can afford, and a government that works for the people\u201d \u2014 that Democrats have largely ignored due to their endless pursual of impeachment.\n\n\u201cI cannot let this horrible smear campaign get in the way of that work,\u201d she continued, telling her supporters that they \u201cshowed the nation that there is hope even in the darkest of moments.\u201d\n\nHill added that she will \u201ctake on a new fight\u201d to \u201censure that no one else has to live through what I just experienced.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people call this electronic assault, digital exploitation. Others call it revenge porn. As the victim of it, I call it one of the worst things that we can do to our sisters and our daughters,\u201d she said, adding that she will \u201cnot allow my experience to scare off other young women or girls from running for office.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the sake of all of us, we cannot let that happen,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hurt. I\u2019m angry. The path that I saw so clearly for myself is no longer there,\u201d Hill continued. \u201cI\u2019ve had moments where I\u2019ve wondered what the last three years of my life were for and if it was worth it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never claimed to be perfect, but I never thought my imperfections would be weaponized and used to try to destroy me and the community I\u2019ve loved for my entire life,\u201d she added. \u201cFor that, I am so incredibly sorry.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
