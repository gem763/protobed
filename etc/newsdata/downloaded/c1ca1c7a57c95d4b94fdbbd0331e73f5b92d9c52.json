It is done all the time,\u201d Trump wrote Friday morning on Twitter. \u201cThis has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!\u201d\n\nTrump previously asserted in a tweet Thursday night that he has \u201can absolute right, perhaps even a duty\u201d as president \u201cto investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) responded to that post Friday, imploring his Republican colleagues to break with the president.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to this. We\u2019ve cut through the denials. The deflections. The nonsense,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cDonald Trump believes he can pressure a foreign nation to help him politically. It\u2019s his \u2018right.\u2019 Every Republican in Congress has to decide: Is he right?\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s latest rationale for his behavior came as Washington awoke Friday to news of damaging text messages exchanged in recent months among top American diplomats. Those communications \u2014 which Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, provided Thursday to congressional Democrats \u2014 detailed efforts by the administration to pressure Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and alleged meddling by the Eastern European nation in the 2016 election.\n\nThe texts are certain to open a new front in the impeachment drive by Democratic lawmakers, who say the explosive messages offer clear evidence that Trump made U.S. military aid and a White House visit contingent upon Zelensky's approval of the probes. The president's Republican defenders on Capitol Hill have so far argued that he proposed no such quid pro quo during his conversation over the summer with his foreign counterpart.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) warned Friday that the revelation of the texts marked an \u201cimportant moment for our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now know that Trump was using access to the White House to get a foreign government to help destroy his political rival,\u201d he tweeted. \"There was an explicit quid pro quo: open an investigation into my rival, and I will invite you to the White House.\u201d\n\nMurphy wrote in another post that while \u201cit\u2019s never been necessary to show an explicit quid pro quo,\u201d the texts also \u201cmake it pretty clear the aid was being withheld until Zelensky chose to investigate.\u201d\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) also tore into the president after the new evidence emerged. \u201cTrump withheld $391 million in security aid for no reason. He then pressured the Ukrainian President to target an American citizen for political gain. How do you describe this extraordinary betrayal of America\u2019s national security?\u201d he tweeted, adding, \u201cABUSE OF POWER.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1e/24/dab080ae48b58e8b155af9fce1c5/191004-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
