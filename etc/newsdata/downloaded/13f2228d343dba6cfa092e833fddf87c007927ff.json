It\u2019s also trying to win the race on bad legislative ideas, too.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Assemblywoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Los Angeles) is pushing a resolution that California would use its economic might to nudge banks and lending institutions away from doing business with federally licensed law abiding firearms manufacturers and retailers if they have open accounts with the Golden State. Assembly Concurrent Resolution 115 would \u201cencourage\u201d six lending institutions to cut all business ties with America\u2019s firearms manufacturers. The goal, according to Kamlager-Dove, is eliminate the production of firearms and the means to exercise Second Amendment rights.\n\nKamlager-Dove explained, \u201cYou cannot have a gun if the gun has not been made. You cannot sell a gun that has not been made.\u201d\n\nThen, Kamlager-Dove does economic policy backflips when she attempts to say it is actually a free-market incentive, because it would allow firearms manufactures to use alternative options when it comes to banking services and loans.\n\nKamlager-Dove couldn\u2019t explain where California state and local law enforcement would buy their firearms if gun production were to be eliminated. She was challenged on her thought process by Republican Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez that inserting personal and political ideology was a dangerous precedent. While Kamlager-Dove was using the resolution as a bludgeon against the firearms industry today to drive a political agenda, a similar authority could be used to deny financial services to what others consider disfavored industries.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder of the importance of rejecting this type of activism being embraced by politicians to distort and misuse the levers of free-market capitalism to attempt to achieve political agendas through corporate boardrooms that they can\u2019t do through legislative and court processes. That\u2019s why the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association, urges Congress to take up the Freedom Financing Act, introduced by U.S. Sens. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) as S. 821. It was also introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives as H.R. 2079, by U.S. Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas).\n\nThe Freedom Financing Act would prevent financial institutions from accessing taxpayer-subsidized government programs when they are at the same time denying banking services to lawful and compliant industries. In other words, big banks wouldn\u2019t be able to benefit from taxpayer-subsidized insurance programs while at the same time discriminating against lawful businesses. If the big banks choose to deny industries like firearms and ammunition manufactures services based on a bias against the products they make, they are free to do so. But, they shouldn\u2019t be entitled to benefit from the money protections that are paid for by U.S. taxpayers, 100 million of whom are gun owners.\n\nCalifornians deserve many more things from their assembly representatives. Bad ideas to limit free markets and eliminate rights isn\u2019t one of them.", "description": "California\u2019s got the most gun control laws in the country. .09/02/2019 3:16:59AM EST.", "authors": ["Lawrence Keane", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/3b03351f-5259-4939-8fec-06a9c908670b.png"}
