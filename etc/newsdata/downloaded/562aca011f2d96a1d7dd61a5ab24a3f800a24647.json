Various press accounts that appeared in 2017 indicated that attendees at the event had concerns about Flynn\u2019s 20-minute conversation with the Russian graduate student.\n\nThe initial complaint in the case used unusually crude language for a federal court pleading.\n\n\u201cStefan Halper is a ratf----- and a spy, who embroiled an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 Presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nLiss was emphatic Friday that nothing untoward has happened between Lokhova and Flynn.\n\n\u201cThere was no closeness,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cThese reports paint the picture that she was acting as a Russian agent. ... She\u2019s not Russian intelligence. Nothing happened at that dinner. It was like a cocktail conversation after dinner.\u201d\n\nHowever, the judge said Lokhova\u2019s involvement in the stories was minor. \u201cEvery one of them is focusing on Flynn,\u201d Brinkema said. \u201cYour client is peripheral.\u201d\n\nAt the end of Friday\u2019s hearing, Brinkema \u2014 an appointee of President Bill Clinton \u2014 halted all discovery in the case until she rules on the motions to dismiss.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the parties spending resources on discovery at this point. I\u2019m putting the case on hold,\u201d she said, apparently signaling that she intends to throw some or all of it out.\n\nOne key issue for many of the stories and tweets Lokhova has complained about is that they were published more than a year before she filed suit in May. Under Virginia law, a libel plaintiff has one year from the publication to bring a suit.\n\nFormer national security adviser Michael Flynn. | Saul Loeb/Pool Photo via AP\n\nLiss argued the news outlets that published stories about Lokhova should be held responsible for \u201cre-publication\u201d every time others tweet out or link to the original stories, but Brinkema said that would eviscerate the one-year statute of limitations in Virginia for libel claims.\n\n\u201cWhy should the law not be that the tweeter be held liable?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cThere has to be some rule of reason.\u201d\n\nLiss said the nature of the internet has made it inevitable that stories will resonate for a longer period and the publishers are aware of that. \u201cOnce it gets into the stream of commerce, these devices allow [anyone] to republish it over and over,\u201d he said.\n\nAttorneys for the news organizations rejected that argument.\n\n\u201cThat is the third-party\u2019s responsibility, not the original publisher,\u201d said Laura Handman, an attorney representing NBC and the Washington Post.\n\nNew York Times lawyer Dana Green said allowing suits over retweeted articles could create \u201cperpetual liability\u201d for national news stories.\n\nAn attorney for the Wall Street Journal, Seth Berlin, compared the situation to an attempt to hold the newspaper responsible because someone else cited one of its stories in a footnote.\n\nPutting my faith in the US justice system. pic.twitter.com/4O0JtDWh62 \u2014 Svetlana Lokhova (@RealSLokhova) October 25, 2019\n\nHandman also noted that the focus of the stories was on Flynn and concerns some of his colleagues had about his interaction with Lokhova. \u201cThey were concerned about his conduct and his attention to her,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even name her. ... This is not someone who\u2019s been on the Post\u2019s radar.\u201d\n\nHandman said the Post did name Lokhova earlier this year, but only after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) mentioned interest in her case. Handman mentioned in passing that Liss is also representing Nunes, who has filed a flurry of libel suits in recent months, including over the Twitter account \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019 Cow.\u201d\n\nTwo lawyers for Halper, Terry Reed and Bob Luskin, were also present at Friday\u2019s hearing. The Cambridge University professor has been the focus of intense speculation about his ties to the FBI and, potentially, U.S. intelligence services.\n\nIn September 2016, Halper invited Trump adviser George Papadopoulos to London and offering to sponsor him to write a paper on energy issues.\n\nMany intelligence experts have speculated that Halper\u2019s invitation was at the behest of the FBI. Papadopoulos says Halper and a mysterious woman who called herself Azra Turk invited him to several meetings and eventually pressed him about whether he had access to emails stolen from Hillary Clinton\u2019s account or campaign. Papadopoulos says he believes the woman was tied to the CIA, not FBI. Neither agency has commented on the claims.\n\nReed did not address those intriguing episodes Friday, but told the judge that Halper should be dismissed from the libel suit because there\u2019s no claim in it that he had anything to do with any stories or tweets published in the year before the case was filed. He also said his client isn\u2019t responsible for the speculation of others.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Lokhova did not respond when a reporter attempted to introduce himself as she exited the courthouse.\n\nAmong those in the gallery at the hearing was an Alexandria-based attorney for Michael Flynn, Jesse Binnall. Binnall told POLITICO after the session that he\u2019d simply stumbled upon the event while giving some visitors a tour of the courthouse.\n\nLokhova\u2019s suit was initially assigned to U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III, but was transferred to Brinkema this week. At the hearing Friday, she mentioned that she\u2019d only received the case on Monday, but she offered no explanation for the reassignment.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Gerstein is a contributor to MSNBC.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a2/dd/5b81e3024d7ba8edcd63ba37528f/191022-edva-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
