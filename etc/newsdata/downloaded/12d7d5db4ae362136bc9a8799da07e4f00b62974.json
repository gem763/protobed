TSLA receives approval from China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to start production at its $2-billion Gigafactory in Shanghai.\n\nThe factory would build affordable versions of Tesla Model 3 and its proposed model Y for Greater China. The company intends to produce at least 1000 Model 3 units per week in the factory as it attempts to strengthen sales in China. However, Tesla is not sure when it will be able to meet the production target for the year because of uncertainties related to orders, workers and suppliers.\n\nThe factory will be the company\u2019s first full-scale production plant outside the United States although it has a factory in Tilburg, Netherlands, which carries out the final assembly of modules.\n\nThe recent approval can be seen as Beijing\u2019s willingness to open up its car market. Moreover, Authorities in Shanghai have offered help to speed up construction of Tesla\u2019s factory.\n\nChina is significant for the company\u2019s global strategy as the government in China has set ambitious targets for electric vehicle (EV) sales.\n\nNotably, Tesla will be the first fully foreign-owned manufacturing facility in the world\u2019s largest auto market.\n\nCurrently, Tesla\u2019s vehicle models imported from the United States are subject to tariffs in China. However, the introduction of the factory will help the company to avoid higher import tariffs. Moreover, China recently exempted Tesla units from a 10% vehicle purchase tax.\n\nRising Model 3 delivery, which forms major part of the automaker\u2019s overall deliveries, is aiding top-line growth. Strong performance and impressive design of the company\u2019s products are ramping up sales volumes.\n\nTesla is making efforts to increase vehicle deliveries. Higher volume should enable the company to achieve cost and production efficiencies. Moreover, its focus on expanding the product portfolio, introducing car-sharing services and developing self-driving capability is commendable.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nA few other top-ranked stocks in the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector are BRP Inc DOOO, Sonic Automotive, Inc SAH, and Lithia Motors, Inc LAD, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
