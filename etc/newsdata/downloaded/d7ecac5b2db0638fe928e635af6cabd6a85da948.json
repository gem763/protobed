Business Insider Intelligence\n\nRecent incidents have sparked relational tensions and internal debate for several US businesses in the media, gaming, and tech spaces:\n\nThe NBA. The league apologized to China after Houston Rockets team general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong, although NBA commissioner Adam Silver later supported Morey's \"ability to exercise his freedom of expression\" in an interview with Kyodo News in Tokyo. In response, state-run broadcaster CCTV and Tencent \u2014 which streams NBA games in the country \u2014 both said they would suspend current plans to broadcast the league's preseason games.\n\nActivision Blizzard. Video game publisher Activision Blizzard suspended the Hong Kong-based gamer Chung Ng Wai (known as \"Blitzchung\") from the company's pro esports league for a year after he voiced support for Hong Kong during a live broadcast, per The New York Times. Blizzard said he had violated its rule prohibiting players from acts that offend a group or damage the company's image.\n\nApple. Apple has removed the mobile app for publisher Quartz from its Chinese App Store, reportedly as a result of its coverage of the Hong Kong protests, per The Verge. The publisher says it received a notice from Apple that the app \"includes content that is illegal in China.\"\n\nWhether or not companies capitulate to such demands depends largely on how well-positioned they already are within the country. The NBA is under less pressure to capitulate to China because league programming is enormously popular in the country: About 800 million Chinese citizens watched NBA broadcasts on TV, digital media, or smartphones in the league's 2018 season.\n\nGiven the NBA's vast audience in the country \u2014 and the fact that there is no immediate substitute \u2014 the league arguably has the upper hand in negotiations with Chinese distributors. By comparison, Activision Blizzard is less able to take the moral high road: If Blizzard angers China and results in restrictions or boycotts, there are ready substitutes. Although the Americas contributed more than half (54%) of Blizzard's total revenue in H2 2019, the APAC region is still a meaningful market: Blizzard earned $173 million from the APAC region, about 12.4% of its $1.4 billion in total revenue \u2014 up from about 11.1% in the prior-year period.\n\nCompanies caught in this fight might face criticism either way \u2014 American and Chinese consumers might have conflicting views about what's right, and both groups care deeply about brand values. Both American and Chinese consumers not only hold brands to a high moral standard, but expect brands they buy from to express their personal values: 83% of US consumers and 88% of Chinese consumers say that a deal-breaker or deciding factor in their purchase decision is whether they can trust a brand to do what is right, per Edelman.\n\nLikewise, 69% of US consumers and 82% of Chinese consumers say they want brands to express their values. Companies that elect to do business with Beijing would likely be best served steering clear of the debate, as taking a side one way or another could cause backlash.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
