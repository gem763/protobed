Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThis is a pivot for Amazon, which previously tried to boost the profitability of its shipping by only delivering inexpensive items like consumer packaged goods (CPG) as part of baskets worth at least $25 or in higher quantities.\n\nThis initiative could boost the e-commerce titan's sales and customer loyalty, while at least temporarily benefiting its merchants.\n\nFor Amazon, offering fast and free delivery for individual CPG items could help it improve its standing in the market and increase consumers' reliance on it.\n\nPreviously, if a consumer wanted to get a stick of deodorant from Amazon and receive Prime's shipping perks, they might have had to buy a pack of four to meet Amazon's requirements. This likely pushed some consumers to purchase a single deodorant stick in a nearby store so they wouldn't have to wait for slower delivery, pay for shipping, or buy more of an item than they wanted to.\n\nBut now that Amazon offers such items with no fees and with next-day shipping, it could boost its sales. And if consumers start turning to Amazon for their immediate needs, it can capture even more of their spend and improve its overall performance going forward.\n\nThird-party merchants that sell cheap goods on Amazon's marketplace should benefit from a boost in sales, but Amazon may make them cover the money it loses in the process.\n\nAmazon has previously gone to brands whose products it sold at a loss and requested \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" to make up for it, and when brands didn't cooperate, Amazon temporarily stopped selling their products, Andrea Leigh, who worked for Amazon for over nine years, according to LinkedIn, and is now VP of strategy and insights at e-commerce services firm Ideoclick, told Recode. So, while brands might be able to gain additional sales from Amazon's new shipping strategy, it may ultimately cost them.\n\nLeveraging its delivery capabilities to drive down prices and potentially holding brands hostage could attract the attention of the regulatory bodies looking into Amazon's business practices. Regulators, including antitrust authorities in the US and EU, might take issue with Amazon taking advantage of its logistics power to offer extremely low prices and using its marketplace's prominence to force merchants to cover its losses.\n\nBoth of these moves leverage its power in a way that few, if any, other retailers can replicate. In conjunction with other business practices, like heavily promoting its own private-label goods on its marketplace, this could lead to fines and sanctions against it in the future.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
