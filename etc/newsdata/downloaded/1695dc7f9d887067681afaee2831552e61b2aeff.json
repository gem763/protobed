Its forebears were also less than auspicious: the Q-5 and its cousin, the J-6 fighter, were based on the Soviet MiG-19 (NATO code name \u201cFarmer\u201d), whose intensive maintenance requirements and difficult handling characteristics proved unpopular with the Soviets and many of their allies, such as North Vietnam. But strangely, China proved quite fond of the MiG-19.\n\nWhich is why the Chinese air force turned to it when it needed a new ground attack aircraft. The Q-5 (and the export version, the A-5) was born in 1955, after Communist China's bloody seizure of Yijangshan Island from Taiwan, where the Communists were able to enjoy air support for once from Soviet-made Il-10 propeller-driven attack aircraft, according to authors Yefim Gordon and Dimitry Komissarov in \u201cChinese Aircraft: China's Aviation Industry since 1951.\u201d Given that most advanced military powers had transitioned from props to jets by the mid-1950s, it is no surprise that by 1958, the People's Liberation Army Air Force wanted a supersonic strike jet.\n\n\u201cThe engineers at Nanchang believed the future aircraft's role would be CAS (close air support),\u201d write Gordon and Komissarov. \u201cTo this end, the fighter-bomber needed good low-altitude performance and plenty of firepower, as well as some potential as a dogfighter for self-defense, good field performance and adequate range and endurance.\u201d\n\nFrom 1958 to 1962, China was convulsed by the Great Leap Forward, which set Chinese aircraft design back. The upheaval \u201cforced many of the younger designers, some with extraordinary zeal, but lacking knowledge in aircraft design, to disobey physical laws and the necessary standards in production, testing and quality management,\u201d writes Andreas Rupprecht in \u201cDragon\u2019s Wings: Chinese Fighter and Bomber Aircraft Development.\u201d Nonetheless, the resulting twin-engined design was bigger and heavier than the J-6 fighter, but nearly as fast at low altitude. In fact, the NATO code name \u201cFantan\u201d would normally have been assigned to a Communist fighter, which Western analysts initially assumed the Q-5 was.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Beijing's got deterrence.", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UeylzctZ_IPxDAVvZtGOqw--~B/aD05MDc7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/b2023a058db40004cb08afe82ca312f9", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
