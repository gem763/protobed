Then his body will be flown to Mexico City next week for a series of public tributes, tentatively including events at the capital's Palace of Fine Arts and National Auditorium.\n\n\"Jose Jose's family agreed to first pay tribute to him in Miami, and then again in Mexico City,\" the statement said.\n\nIt did not say where he would be laid to rest.\n\nHowever, one key mystery did get cleared up: his body is at a funeral home in Miami.\n\n\"He's here, we're certain now,\" Jose Joel told journalists outside the establishment. \"They're preparing him, embalming him.\"\n\n\"We're united as a family to give our father, our prince, the tribute and burial he deserves, with all our love,\" he added.\n\n- Mourning and mystery -\n\nJose Jose's death unleashed an outpouring of emotion in Mexico, where fans belted out his hits through tears in public and flocked to mourn at a statue of him in his native Mexico City neighborhood.\n\nBut the tears had not even finished flowing when the loss took a telenovela-like turn.\n\nJose Joel and Marysol, his eldest children, said their half-sister, Sarita, would not let them see his body. They called for an autopsy, filed a police report, hired a lawyer and insisted they would not believe he was dead until they saw him with their own eyes.\n\nA furious Jose Joel said Sarita, 25, was \"after the money,\" and accused her of hiding their father's body as part of a plan to sell exclusive media rights to the funeral.\n\nWith his velvety voice and songs of heartbreak, Jose Romulo Sosa Ortiz -- better known by his stage name, Jose Jose -- sold more than 120 million albums in a career spanning over five decades.\n\nHe married three times, fathering Jose Joel and Marysol with his second wife and Sarita with his third.\n\nHe ceded all rights to his songs to Sarita, who lived with him and her mother, Sara, in Miami.", "description": "After days of drama involving a missing corpse, a family feud and a soundtrack of heartbroken love songs, late Latin singing sensation Jose Jose's children have set aside their differences and agreed on plans for his funeral, the Mexican government said Wednesday.
