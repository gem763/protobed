This was in fact double the (undisclosed) Nike offer that New Balance was entitled to match.'\n\nThe documents also detail how both New Balance and Nike have offered 20 per cent royalties on net sales of clothing and offer a \u00a34m performance bonus if Liverpool win the Champions League.\n\nThe skeleton argument for Boston-based retailer New Balance - which has sold Liverpool's kit since 2011 - claims to have seen a Whatsapp message from Liverpool's chief commercial officer Billy Hogan which says 'this match clause just absolutely screws us'.\n\nMr Oudkerk QC added: 'New Balance plainly did have reasonable grounds for believing they could match the offer.'\n\nHowever, Guy Morpuss QC, representing Liverpool, said that New Balance have 'pretended' they can achieve the projected distribution volume of 6,000 stores.\n\nIt is expected that the case will focus on whether New Balance 'genuinely believed' it could match Nike's proposal to stock Liverpool's kit in 6,000 stores\n\n'The idea that New Balance could get Liverpool kit into anywhere near 40,000 stores is utterly fanciful,' he told the court.\n\nHe later queried how New Balance thought it could grow its distribution network from the current number of 2,800 doors to 6,000 'in a matter of seven months'.\n\nCourt heard that New Balance's initial renewal proposal had included a figure for 6,300 stores, but this had later been reduced to 6,146.\n\nMr Morpuss QC added: 'They have a record of telling Liverpool things that were wrong... and grossly overstated', and said that Liverpool's defence will rest on 'five serious errors' in the figures relied upon by New Balance, which were provided by the company's 'regional managers'.\n\nCross-examination of New Balance's first witness Christopher Davis, vice president for Global Marketing and Sports Marketing, continues.", "description": "LAURA LAMBERT AT COMMERCIAL COURT: It is expected that case will focus on whether New Balance 'genuinely believed' it could match Nike's proposal to stock  kit in 6,000 stores.", "authors": ["Laura Lambert For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/13/19881884-0-image-a-65_1571400339878.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
