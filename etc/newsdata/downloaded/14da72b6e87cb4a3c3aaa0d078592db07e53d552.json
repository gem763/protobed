Scientists are despairing because we are almost out of time. They are telling us to panic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The weather won\u2019t wait for politics, and so we will gather in Westminster and stay until the Government tells the truth that families across this country need to know.\n\n\u2018This includes the terrifying likelihood that our supermarkets will fail us because the food system is too fragile to continually withstand the shocks of extreme weather happening in other parts of the world.\u2019\n\nMany protesters attended Sunday\u2019s opening with tents and supplies in preparation for the upcoming fortnight.\n\nPeople have travelled to London from across the UK as part of an international Extinction Rebellion (Picture: PA)\n\nMarble Arch will be used throughout the two-week protests as other sites are moved between (Picture: Jamie Lorriman)\n\nThey have set up camp in Hyde Park ahead of the planned demonstrations (Picture: Jamie Lorriman)\n\nThe group is expecting several thousand people to target different government departments, Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament over the next two weeks, according to a Extinction Rebellion spokesman.\n\nChay, a 23-year-old student from Bristol, said: \u2018We\u2019re here to hold our government to account for the shameful disregard for the climate crisis and wider environmental issues we\u2019re facing at the current time.\n\nDrivers who leave engine running while parked 'should be fined'\n\n\u2018We have many, many actions going on over the next two weeks, I won\u2019t give too much away as I want to leave something to the imagination but we are going to be focusing heavily on Westminster because we feel that our elected officials have let us down time and time again and we think it\u2019s time they learned that we are here for the long run.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday the group criticised the Metropolitan Police for alleged pre-emptive arrests and the confiscation of equipment including gazebos and beanbags.\n\nSunday\u2019s protest was policed by two vans of officers who were stationed by Marble Arch, a small distance from the main protesters.\n\nGroups of artists held a procession around Marble Arch as the protesters were told to \u2018surround\u2019 the upcoming demonstrations with love (Picture: LNP)\n\nMore than a thousand people attended an \u2018opening ceremony\u2019 at Marble Arch (Picture: LNP)\n\nMs Jones added: \u2018There is a misconception with Extinction Rebellion that to be involved you have to be arrested but that is not the case.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018At the moment we know we have 11 years to sort out our greenhouse emissions and that means in the next 18 months we have to have radical political change and the one way we have seen in history to get radical political change is to do non-violent political action.\u2019\n\nThe protesters ranged in age from small children to the elderly, with many referencing the urgency of climate change for young people.\n\nGrace added: \u2018If you look at the people who are in government most of them are a lot older and they\u2019re not going to be alive when this happens and they should be listening to us because they don\u2019t have to worry about it but I do and it\u2019s not fair.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
