The woman later gave mixed signals about her desire to die, but the doctor, in close consultation with the woman\u2019s family, decided to go ahead with the mercy killing.\n\nThe Hague District Court ruled that in rare cases of euthanasia on patients with severe dementia - and who had earlier made a written request for euthanasia - the doctor \u201cdid not have to verify the current desire to die.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said they disagreed with the Hague court and want the Supreme Court to rule on legal issues in the case.\n\nPending the outcome of the Supreme Court case, prosecutors said they are suspending consideration of other euthanasia cases that deal with the same issues.\n\nUnder Dutch law, people are eligible for euthanasia if they make a considered, voluntary request and if their suffering is hopelessly \u201cunbearable.\u201d Patients can draw up a written request for euthanasia to be performed sometime in the future, in an advance directive, which should specify the conditions determining when they want to be euthanized. Doctors must also seek the advice of at least one other independent physician before killing the patient.\n\nEuthanasia cases among people with advanced dementia are extremely rare in the Netherlands. There have been fewer than 20 cases since the procedure was legalized in 2002.\n\nThe Netherlands is one of five countries that allow doctors to kill patients at their request, and one of two, along with Belgium, that grant the procedure for people with mental illness.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Prosecutors have asked the Netherlands' Supreme Court to clarify legal matters in a landmark euthanasia case, saying Thursday they want to lay down unambiguous jurisprudence for the future.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mike Corder"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
