Much of the harbor area appeared to be abandoned farmland just a year ago, according to earlier images CSIS analyzed.\n\nIt dwarfs an existing harbor nearby, where destroyers and other warships are docked.\n\n\"We can see slow but steady progress on the hull, but I think the really surprising thing these images show is the extensive infrastructure buildup that has gone on simultaneously,\" said CSIS analyst Matthew Funaiole.\n\n\"It is hard to imagine all this is being done for just one ship,\" he added. \"This looks more like a specialized space for carriers and or other larger vessels.\"\n\nSingapore-based military analyst Collin Koh said the modern, purpose-built facility on a sparsely populated island in the Yangtze may provide better security than the congested shipyards of Dalian in northern China. It could also help deepen co-operation between commercial and military shipbuilders.\n\nThe London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies noted this year that China's military shipyards were focusing increasingly on larger surface warships, \"adding to the sense that Chinese naval-capability development may be entering a new phase.\"\n\nChina's navy has recently launched four large Type 055 cruisers and its first large helicopter carrier, known as the Type 075.\n\nChina's military has not formally announced the plans for the third carrier, designated Type 002, but official state media have said it is being built.\n\nThe Pentagon said it in its annual survey of China's military modernization, published in May, that work on the third carrier had begun.\n\nChina's Ministry of Defence did not respond to questions from Reuters.\n\nFunaiole said the latest images appeared to confirm the earlier photos, which suggested the latest carrier would be somewhat smaller the 100,000-tonne \"supercarriers\" operated by the U.S. but larger than France's 42,500-tonne Charles de Gaulle.\n\nThe images are due to be released by the CSIS China Power Project later Thursday.\n\nAsian and Western militaries are tracking developments closely. They say this carrier would represent a vital step in China's ambitions to create a far-ranging navy that can project power around the world to serve Beijing's expanding global interests.\n\nA series of recent Reuters Special Reports showed how that effort is challenging decades of U.S. strategic superiority in East Asia.\n\n(Click this link to read the series: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-army-xi/)\n\nIt is expected to be China's first carrier with a flat deck and catapult launch system, allowing the use of a wider range of aircraft and more heavily armed fighter jets.\n\nChina's first two carriers, which it has dubbed Type 001-class, are relatively small, accommodating only up to 25 aircraft that are launched from ramps built onto their decks. U.S. carriers routinely deploy with nearly four times the number of aircraft.\n\nForeign military attaches and security analysts say the Type 001 ships are expected to essentially serve as training platforms for what they believe will be fleet of up to six operational carriers by 2030.\n\nThey say the construction and deployment of aircraft carriers is considered exceptionally difficult to master. Protecting such a large and vital surface target with escort ships, submarines and aircraft is a core part of the problem.", "description": "HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - High-resolution satellite images show that the construction of China's first full-sized aircraft carrier is progressing steadily alongside expansive infrastructure work that analysts say suggests the ship will be the first of several large vessels produced at the site", "authors": ["Greg Torode", "Michael Martina"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/p585gaXvbUAUiKESx3_1Zg--~B/aD0yODk7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/05fd7ee1a8c51f3edbceaa244a628de1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
