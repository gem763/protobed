Shape Created with Sketch. 30 best children's books 1/30 30. Tom Brown\u2019s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857) This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling. And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn\u2019t have George McDonald Fraser\u2019s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 2/30 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902) Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past; but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter\u2019s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original. 3/30 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003) Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn\u2019t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 4/30 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan) The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature. 5/30 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001) Former Children\u2019s Laureate Malorie Blackman\u2019s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original. 6/30 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967) A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 7/30 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953) As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle\u2019s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world\u2019s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth\u2019s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed. 8/30 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001) A wondrously clever book that upturns children\u2019s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who\u2019s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 9/30 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981) I\u2019ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall\u2019s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy\u2019s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting. 10/30 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century) First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone blazed into the world\u2019s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon. 11/30 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973) Penelope Lively once said that \u201cChildren need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.\u201d Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving. 12/30 19. Tom\u2019s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958) Considered by many to be one of children\u2019s literature\u2019s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 13/30 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968) The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts. 14/30 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962) This has all the hallmarks of classic children\u2019s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie\u2019s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance. 15/30 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936) What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what\u2019s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 16/30 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963) A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it\u2019s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max\u2019s imaginative world grows; how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals; how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too. 17/30 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988) I\u2019m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl\u2019s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl\u2019s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature\u2019s great villains. 18/30 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894) Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a \u201csleepy brown bear\u201d, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination. 19/30 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902) A representative from the first Golden Age of children\u2019s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit\u2019s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or \u201csand fairy\u201d), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn\u2019t always offer a solution. 20/30 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958) Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White\u2019s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations; and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more. 21/30 10. The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame (1908) There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children\u2019s book, or whether it\u2019s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad\u2019s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life. 22/30 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937) In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits\u2019 world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in; and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 23/30 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995) Philip Pullman\u2019s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children\u2019s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility; his story spellbinding; and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 24/30 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century) The best children\u2019s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis\u2019 stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk; the knightly adventures of the children are gripping. 25/30 6. The Pilgrim's Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678) One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars; unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 26/30 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911) Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children\u2019s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint; however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland; the sense of unbounded imagination; and the dizzying allure of flight and magic. 27/30 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales) This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential. 28/30 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century) A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda\u2019s search for her brother Kay in \u2018The Snow Queen\u2019; the Little Mermaid\u2019s mute passion for her prince; gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 29/30 2. Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen (\u2018Nursery and Household Tales\u2019) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century) Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms\u2019 lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike. We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel; but have you read \u201cHans my Hedgehog\u201d, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 30/30 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century) Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children\u2019s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment. 1/30 30. Tom Brown\u2019s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857) This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.
