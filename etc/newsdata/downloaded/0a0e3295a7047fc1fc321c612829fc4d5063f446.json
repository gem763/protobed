late Uzbek leader still out in the cold", "language": "en", "text": "Tashkent (AFP) \u2013 Journalist and former prisoner Dilmurod Saidov knows a thing or two about the brutal rule of Uzbekistan\u2019s first leader, the late Islam Karimov.\n\nHis house is full of reminders of the wife and daughter who died in a 2009 car crash that he never accepted was an accident, en route to visit him in a jail where he should never have served time.\n\n\u201cGod gave me such a faithful wife and such a wonderful daughter,\u201d he told AFP, of his partner Barno, framed in a photo on a table in his flat, and five-year-old Rukhshona, who stared out from the desktop background of a battered computer in a festive frock.\n\n\u201cThen he took them back again.\u201d\n\nSaidov, 57, is one of more than 30 people imprisoned on politically motivated charges who have been released since Karimov\u2019s death in 2016 as new leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev takes steps to reverse the country\u2019s isolationist course.\n\nMirziyoyev\u2019s reforms have won plaudits, and seen the ex-Soviet republic \u2014 long ranked as one of the world\u2019s worst abusers of human rights \u2014 throw its doors open to tourists and foreign investments surge.\n\nBut the new president has not publicly renounced Karimov, a man he served as prime minister for more than 13 years before stepping up as acting head of state three years ago, and has kept much of the authoritarian system intact.\n\nIn a series of interviews with AFP in the capital Tashkent, former political prisoners like Saidov acknowledged that progress had been made, but said abuses were continuing and urged the world not to turn a blind eye.\n\n\u2013 Suspicious car crash \u2013\n\nSaidov, an independent journalist, was arrested in 2009 and convicted of bribery and forgery, charges he denies and says were punishment for years of reporting on corruption and rights abuses in Karimov\u2019s Uzbekistan.\n\nSentenced to 12 and a half years in prison after what Human Rights Watch called at the time \u201ca flawed trial brought on politically motivated charges\u201d, he was granted early release just over a year after Karimov died.\n\nSince emerging from prison he has tried to resume his rights work, but a bid with another prominent former detainee to register a campaign group called Restoration of Justice has been refused three times by the justice ministry.\n\nHis attempts to overturn his conviction and to investigate the car crash that killed his wife and daughter have been similarly stonewalled.\n\nJust before their deaths, he says, prosecutors threatened to take Rukhshona hostage if he did not confess to accusations of bribery and falsification of documents and testify against other citizens.\n\nHe found out about their deaths several days later from his brother.\n\nSaidov has never believed the official version of the crash \u2014 that a truck collided with the taxi they were travelling in, killing the driver and all five passengers.\n\nThe trucker sentenced over the crash was released one year into a seven-and-a-half-year sentence, Saidov says, and died the year after he left prison.\n\n\u201cThe staff at her kindergarten knew about (the threats),\u201d says Saidov, who said he contracted tuberculosis in prison.\n\n\u201cWhoever ordered this (car crash) must have been powerful, because prosecutors are still covering it up.\u201d\n\nThe late strongman ruled the country bordering Afghanistan with an iron fist for more than a quarter of a century.\n\nInternational organisations and foreign governments have acknowledged the scale of change in Uzbekistan, a landlocked Central Asian country which once showed little shame in its status as an elite rights offender.\n\n\u2013 \u2018House of Torture\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn August, Mirziyoyev won broad praise for ordering the closure of the notorious Jaslyk penal colony \u2014 known as the \u201cHouse of Torture\u201d for the extreme abuses inflicted on inmates \u2014 in the country\u2019s remote northwest.\n\nThe prison, a grim calling card of Karimov\u2019s rule, was briefly home to Akzam Turgunov, a rights activist who met Saidov during a stint in another jail and is now his partner in the Restoration of Justice group.\n\n\u201cIt was a place they sent prisoners they wanted to break,\u201d Turgunov told AFP.\n\n\u201cI thought I was mentally prepared, but when they began to drip boiling water (on my body) and told me I would not leave the place alive I was gripped by an intense fear.\u201d\n\nTurgunov, who was released a few months short of the end of a 10-year sentence for extortion, says Mirziyoyev\u2019s order was an important step.\n\nBut he fears it could be a maneuver \u201cto distract foreign rights organisations\u201d from other abuses that he says continue to take place in the majority-Muslim republic of 33 million.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says that thousands of people are still imprisoned in Uzbekistan for political reasons.\n\nIt also said last year that ex-political prisoners like Saidov and Turgunov continue to face \u201clegal and economic barriers\u2026 including restrictions on freedom of movement, inability to obtain court decisions needed to appeal unlawful sentences, surveillance, and inadequate medical care for health ailments stemming from their incarceration.\u201d\n\nUzbekistan\u2019s government has also been hailed for acknowledging and condemning the practice of forced labour, which was systemic in the country\u2019s lucrative cotton harvest.\n\nDuring the Karimov era, monitors who documented rights abuses including the use of school-age children as unpaid pickers were routinely detained and harassed by authorities.\n\nOne of these activists, Elena Urlaeva, was committed to state psychiatric institutions several times, and once suffered the humiliation of being watched by police as a gynaecologist cavity-searched her in a bid to locate a data storage device.\n\n\u201cThose times are in the past, and that is good,\u201d says Urlaeva, who now sits at the same table as government officials at events on the fight against forced labour, which the International Labour Organization said fell in Uzbekistan by half last year alone.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Obstructing civil society\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut \u2014 in part due to pressure on Western companies who buy the country\u2019s cotton \u2014 the harvest has long been a source of rare international attention on Uzbekistan.\n\nIn many other facets of public life, critics say there is more continuity than change.\n\n\u201cThings have relaxed a bit, but there is no space for complacency,\u201d says Umida Akhmedova, a well-known photographer and filmmaker.\n\nShe was convicted of slandering the country in 2010 after highlighting the difficult plight of young women in rural Uzbekistan.\n\nShe was amnestied immediately, following an international outcry.\n\nAkhmedova cites ongoing judicial and police abuses as causes for pessimism, as well as widespread rights\u2019 violations of homeowners, who have protested against forced evictions amidst a post-Karimov construction boom.\n\nThese are the sorts of issues that Saidov and Turgunov say the Restoration of Justice group would aim to address \u2014 if it were allowed to operate.\n\nThe refusal by authorities to register the group \u201cand tens of other organisations\u2026 casts serious doubts about how deep ongoing reforms run,\u201d says Marius Fossum, a regional representative for the Norwegian Helsinki Committee.\n\n\u201cMeaningful and systemic change cannot be achieved without partnering with, instead of obstructing, civil society,\u201d Fossum told AFP in emailed comments.\n\nFor Saidov, the last year and a half have brought freedom, but also some shock over the state of civil society, which he compares to \u201ca person in critical condition\u201d.\n\nThe problem, he says, is simple: \u201cThe old team is still in place.\u201d", "description": "Tashkent (AFP) \u2013 Journalist and former prisoner Dilmurod Saidov knows a thing or two about the brutal
