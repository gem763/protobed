Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)\n\nWall Street is sounding the alarm over Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rise in the Democratic presidential race, as investors start to grapple with the possibility the industry scourge secures her party's nomination.\n\nOne investor joked that the stock market wouldn't even open if the Massachusetts senator became president; a segment on CNBC featured the idea that married couples could get divorced rather than be subjected to Warren's \"wealth tax.\"\n\nFor now, the rising nerves are mostly evident in chatter. There's an emerging consensus that a Warren presidency would hurt the stock market -- yet there\u2019s little evidence that investors are pricing in the risk.\n\n\"From a pure markets perspective, a Warren nomination hardly seemed 'priced in,'\" Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group writes. He offers a few theories why that's the case: The election remains far away; Warren could be seen as a weaker Trump foe; or that Warren will moderate her pitch if she secures the nomination. \"In any event, buckle up.\"\n\nGreg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist for AGF Investments, dismissed the possibility of market fallout from the firestorm in Washington over reports Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden \u2014 and the renewed impeachment talk it has touched off.\n\n\u201cWhat could affect the markets, however, is what we have warned about for months: the growing possibility that [Warren] may be the Democrats\u2019 nominee,\u201d Valliere writes.\n\nHedge fund titan Leon Cooperman went further. \u201cThey won\u2019t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president,\u201d he said to the crowd at the Delivering Alpha Conference, apparently joking.\n\nHe later clarified the comment in a CNBC interview, saying the market would open, just \u201ca hell of a lot lower,\u201d estimating a 25 percent selloff and a bear market lasting at least a year. (Institutional investors, according to an RBC survey, view the Massachusetts Democrat as the candidate most threatening to the stock market, beating out Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 51 percent to 38 percent.)\n\nThe network just aired a piece suggesting married couples rich enough to face Warren\u2019s wealth tax, which proposes a 2 percent levy on a household's assets greater than $50 million, could avoid it by getting divorced. Richer couples stand to save even more by splitting, since the tax would apply an extra percent to assets over $1 billion. \u201cIf a couple worth $2 billion divorces, they would save $10 million a year in taxes,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Robert Frank explained.\n\nGordon Charlop and Christian Bader work at the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)\n\nCouples could continue living together, the piece suggested, and just legally end their marriages for the tax savings. No matter that Warren\u2019s proposal, if she is nominated then elected, still faces exceedingly long odds in what is expected to be a closely divided Senate.\n\n\u201cThe markets probably won't really focus on the campaigns until the candidates have been set next year at the parties' conventions, says Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management,\u201d Randall Forsyth writes in Barron\u2019s. \u201cEven so, Wall Street has taken notice of Warren's recent surge in the polls past Sanders, to second place behind [Biden].\u201d\n\nIndeed, Warren\u2019s growing traction in the Democratic race is making a possible presidency more vivid for financiers she wants to subject to higher taxes and tougher regulation.\n\nThe latest Des Moines Register poll showed the senator leading in Iowa for the first time, edging ahead of Biden, 22 percent to 20 percent, though still within the survey\u2019s 4 percent margin of error. And a new national Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll finds Biden and Warren separating from the rest of the field. Biden is backed by 31 percent, Warren pulled in 25 percent, and Sanders, at 14 percent, was the only other candidates with more than single-digit support.\n\nThe \u201cultimate irony,\u201d Valliere writes, is that Trump \u201cis going after the wrong opponent. His scorched earth assault on Biden comes as the former vice president is slipping into second place in the fight to win the nomination. Warren is the candidate Trump needs to worry about; simply calling her \u2018Pocahontas\u2019 will not be sufficient to stop her momentum.\u201d\n\nWarren's rise hasn't yet weighed on stock prices. But the rising level of alarm among investors suggests they may be clearer-eyed about Trump\u2019s challengers than the president himself.\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington. Not a regular subscriber?\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\n\u2014 Wall Street quant finds rising impeachment risk. The possibility of impeachment no longer drives market performance the way it did, say, in the opening months of Trump\u2019s presidency, when the prospect of his ouster clouded the outlook for his corporate tax cut. But GeoQuant CEO Mark Rosenberg, whose firm uses artificial intelligence-powered indexes to chart different kinds of political risks, says Trump now faces the highest risk of impeachment yet. His \"Mueller Risk Index,\" which measures institutional support for the president, shows the threat to Trump spiking early next month:\n\n\u201cI am a bit surprised that these events pushed us to an all time peak--higher than late June 2017, when Mueller expanded the probe to include obstruction and was reportedly ordered to be fired by Trump,\u201d Rosenberg emails. But he also notes his index shows the risk trailing off sharply after early next month, \u201csuggesting that a successful impeachment remains quite unlikely.\u201d\n\n\u2014 British court: Boris Johnson acted illegally. The Post's Karla Adam and William Booth: \"Britain\u2019s highest court dealt a major blow on Tuesday to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, ruling that his controversial decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful, in a landmark judgment that will have immediate implications for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. In one of the most high-profile cases to come before Britain\u2019s Supreme Court, the 11 judges ruled unanimously that Johnson had not acted lawfully in shuttering Parliament...\n\n\"The decision was a brutal one for the embattled prime minister, asserting that his move to suspend the Parliament was political maneuver, and suggesting that he might have misled the queen... Johnson, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session, said he will not resign.\"\n\n\u2014 NY Fed: Central bank did the right thing last week. CNBC's Jeff Cox: \"New York Fed President John Williams said Monday that the central bank acted quickly during last week\u2019s jolt to overnight lending markets and that the issue appears resolved for now. However, he cautioned that short-term lending markets face another crisis, though a few years in the distance, if banks don\u2019t prepare themselves for when the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, is phased out. LIBOR is used as an international benchmark for overnight lending.\n\n\"Williams also said that there\u2019s potential for further disruptions at the end of the quarter Sept. 30 and that the Fed is continuing to monitor the need for more reserves in the system.\"\n\nThe Fed May Have Shrunk Its Balance Sheet Too Much.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\n\u2014 Japan trade deal stalls: \u201cThe trade agreement [Trump] told Congress he had reached with Japan last week is now hung up amid Japanese concerns that Trump will still move to penalize their auto shipments to the United States, according to two people familiar with the negotiations,\u201d my colleague David J. Lynch reports.\n\n\u201cJapanese officials have insisted they should be able to back out of the deal if Trump imposes these tariffs, something he has threatened to do for more than a year. This concern has emerged as the principal substantive issue before a formal pact can be signed, said the people, who weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the private deliberations. Trump had wanted to ink the deal during the U.N. General Assembly session in New York, but that now appears unlikely.\u201d\n\nWhat might happen this week: \u201cThe finishing touches now are unlikely to be completed in time for Wednesday\u2019s scheduled meeting between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
