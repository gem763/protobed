He entered the game with a 6.28 ERA against the Braves when pitching at home.\n\nThe Nationals\u2018 chances of making the playoffs were 93.4% before Sunday\u2019s game, according to ESPN. The Braves still hold a 9\u00bd-game lead in the National League East standings.\n\nGetting another start at catcher, Yan Gomes had a two-run single as the Nationals took a 2-0 lead in the second.\n\nTop catcher Kurt Suzuki has missed the last week with right elbow inflammation.\n\nWashington added three more in the third, as Kendrick had a two-run single and Victor Robles walked with the bases loaded to make it 5-0.\n\nKendrick, who upped his average to .336, hit a long solo homer to left in the fifth for a 6-0 bulge and the Nationals had a run in the sixth on a double-play grounder for a 7-0 lead.\n\nBraves starting pitcher Max Fried (16-6) gave up five runs in just 2 1/3 innings in his shortest outing since May 7.\n\nThe Washington lineup again was missing slugger Matt Adams, who hurt his shoulder Thursday on the road against the Minnesota Twins. Washington manager Dave Martinez said Adams is day to day, as Kendrick got the start at first base over Ryan Zimmerman.\n\nThe Nationals bullpen had a 5.92 ERA before Sunday and had allowed 82 homers and gave up nine runs Saturday in the loss. Hunter Strickland took over for Sanchez in the eighth and pitched a scoreless frame and Sean Doolittle threw the ninth.\n\nWashington begins a three-game series Monday in St. Louis against the first-place Cardinals, who will start right-hander Dakota Hudson (15-7, 3.38). The Nationals will counter with Stephen Strasburg (17-6, 3.49), who leads the National League in wins.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
