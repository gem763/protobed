The advance this year comes alongside big rallies in both bonds and commodities.\n\nThe concurrent rise in historically safe assets like Treasurys alongside riskier bets like U.S. stocks highlights the uncertainty investors feel about the global economy, the state of trade talks with China and the Federal Reserve's path of monetary easing.\n\n\"Never in my 25 years of doing this has so much seemingly revolved around what will happen from a political perspective each and every day, \" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. \"There's always uncertainty.\"\n\nDespite this unease, many investors say they see few alternatives to U.S. stocks. The domestic economy remains on a stronger footing than most peers, and the amount of negatively yielding debt around the world swelled in the last quarter, leaving investors chasing yield.\n\nThe S&P 500 is now sitting just 1.6% below July 26's all-time high, but it has also risen a mere 2.2% from a year ago after a brutal selloff last fall -- encapsulating the sideways trading pattern that has gripped markets since the beginning of 2018.\n\nThe quarter ended on a relatively quiet note. The S&P 500 ticked up 0.5% to 2976.74 Monday, paced by Apple, which closed at its highest level this year.\n\nUnderneath the surface, it was a dizzying three months for markets.\n\nStocks surged to new highs in July ahead of the Federal Reserve's first cut to interest rates in a decade, but then dropped in August -- with the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffering its biggest decline of the year -- as the long-simmering trade war with China escalated and fears of a U.S. recession bubbled.\n\nMajor indexes clawed back those losses in the following weeks as investors rotated out of some of the momentum stocks that have propelled the decadelong bull market, in favor of shares that appeared undervalued.\n\nThe volatility in the quarter wasn't limited to stocks. Government bond yields in the U.S. and Europe tumbled in August -- with the 30-year Treasury yield touching a record low. Brent crude oil recorded its biggest percentage jump on record after an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure. And the Chinese yuan swung against the U.S. dollar, raising fears about a currency battle.\n\nInvestors have also turned to the U.S. dollar as fears about waning economic growth around the world have grown. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, has hit some of its highest levels of the year this quarter.\n\nMany investors say they are bracing for more turbulence ahead.\n\nBond yields have retraced some of their fall as the growth fears that gripped markets in August subsided, and oil prices pared gains. Although U.S. stock moves have been more muted recently, many are wary of a repeat of last year when the S&P 500 peaked in late September and then tumbled almost 20% over the next three months.\n\n\"The third quarter of 2019 was a momentous one,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. \"Heading into the fourth quarter the main drivers still remain U.S. corporate earnings and global economic data, both of which have been overshadowed by the trade war.\"\n\nAmong the potential catalysts on the horizon: U.S. leaders will meet with their Chinese counterparts for the next round of trade talks in October. Investors have been particularly sensitive to trade headlines -- and related tweets from President Trump -- in recent weeks, and they've spurred big intraday stock swings. They are also monitoring political drama in Washington as lawmakers proceed with an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\nOn the economic front, investors on Friday will parse the latest monthly jobs figures, which could have wide-ranging implications for bond, stock and currency markets as well as the Fed's next moves.\n\nHiring slowed in August, suggesting that a global economic slowdown has already crimped domestic growth at a time when manufacturing data around the world has weakened. The U.S. consumer has been a relative bright spot, but new data released last week showed that shoppers slowed spending in August while businesses cut back on investment.\n\nIn the coming weeks, investors will also parse third-quarter earnings reports, which are expected to show another period of lower profit. They will also be watching for clues on the Fed's path after the central bank cut interest rates twice in the third quarter. Investors are betting on up to two more rate cuts this year, though the central bank's latest meeting revealed a growing split among officials over the decision.\n\nThe Fed's moves are part of a trend around the world -- 16 central banks lowered rates in the third quarter, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts, who expect almost two dozen more to slash rates in the fourth quarter.\n\nUnexpected turmoil also crept into a little-watched corner of the market: repurchase, or \"repo\" agreements, considered the plumbing of financial markets. Interest rates on short-term loans banks make to each other overnight spiked in September, leading the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to flood the market with temporary funding to ease a cash crunch.\n\n\"Every time there's bad news, it's actually good news because it means our saviors at the central banks are going to continue to support the markets,\" said Nick Clay, a portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management.\n\nPaul J.
