That\u2019s a smart strategy for a presumptive frontrunner.\n\nJOE BIDEN WILL BE DEMOCRATS' 'COLLATERAL DAMAGE' IN QUEST TO IMPEACH TRUMP, CHARLES LANE SAYS\n\n\u201cI know there are times when only a bare-knuckle fight will do,\u201d Biden exclaimed in May the kickoff to cheers. At one point, the crowd even erupted in chants screaming, \u201cWe want Trump!\u201d and Biden repeated \u201cBeat Trump\u201d three times to emphasize this message.\n\nThe Team Biden strategy became clear: elevate Biden above the fray of the Democratic Primary and cast him as the \u201cmost electable\u201d fighter who can go toe-to-toe with Trump.\n\nSince May, Biden\u2019s surrogates have continuously touted the former vice president as the \u201cmost electable\u201d Democrat in the race. Trump is taking that claim seriously and he persists with allegations that Biden and his son, Hunter, are corrupt. Yet Biden isn\u2019t stepping in the ring to fight.\n\nAt a recent SEIU event in Los Angeles, Biden angrily responded to a reporters\u2019 question about the Ukraine-Biden imbroglio saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to respond to it. I\u2019m not going to talk about anything other than what the facts are. This is not about me, it\u2019s not about my son. There\u2019s not a shred of evidence that anything he\u2019s done is wrong\u2026[Trump\u2019s] unhinged\u2026I worry about what he\u2019s going to do\u2014not about me or my family\u2014I\u2019m worried about what he\u2019ll do in next year of his presidency.\u201d The press conference quickly devolved as Biden, finger-pointing and veins-bulging,\u2014said \u201cfocus on this man [Trump].\u201d\n\nAnd this week, Biden joined every other major 2020 Democrat running for president in calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nStill, that\u2019s not enough for voters who desperately want a fighter, not a deflector, and it\u2019s not enough to stop a political story that has many tentacles.\n\nDemocratic primary voters consistently say they want a candidate who can take on Trump. This is Biden\u2019s chance to take it to Trump and be the fighter he claims to be.\n\nAt some point, Biden will have to return a punch at Trump and address this issue. The sooner he can, the better. It may make all the difference between winning the Democratic nomination (and possibly the presidency) or becoming another politician vanquished by Trump\u2019s tricks.\n\nThis fight, this \u201cbare-knuckle\u201d bout with Trump is what Biden set himself up for in May, so why he is backing away?\n\nTrump is giving the scrappy Scranton streetfighter a gift\u2014by attacking Biden, and only Biden\u2014Trump is making this election a two-person race.\n\nBiden\u2019s wish is being served up to him on a golden platter. In an ill-advised-over-abundance-of-caution, Biden is missing his chance to crowd out his competition by showing voters he can go toe-to-toe with Trump.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not easy to blame a father for laying low as the president of the United States attacks his son\u2014Biden is burying his head in the sand.\n\nA deflection strategy may have worked against any other candidate, but Trump isn\u2019t just throwing a grenade and walking away\u2014he\u2019s setting up an outpost in the Democrats\u2019 territory and lobbing grenade after grenade at Biden\u2014often burning himself in the process.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, like a pinpoint laser beam, is focusing the impeachment inquiry narrowly on Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president and every time the media discusses the inquiry, Joe and Hunter Biden are likely to be invoked.\n\nThe media, rightfully so, will cover this conflict with new headlines every day provided that the Democratic House moves on with an impeachment inquiry and the president continues to toss those grenades without caution.\n\nFor Biden\u2019s Democratic primary rivals, this story continues to bruise their main opponents\u2014Trump and Biden. They will let this story drag on as long as possible in hopes of taking the Democratic frontrunner out of contention for the nomination while badly damaging Trump before the general election.\n\nThis story is enough to send Biden\u2019s supporters to other Democratic candidates who may quickly become \u201cmore electable\u201d as Biden dithers.\n\nTrump\u2019s strategy\u2014to take Biden out\u2014is working. Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic contenders also continue to chip away at Biden. But this race is far from over and if Biden can successfully answer Trump\u2019s attacks while throwing a strong counterpunch, he can crowd out the other Democrats and make this effectively a two-person race.\n\nDemocratic primary voters consistently say they want a candidate who can take on Trump. This is Biden\u2019s chance to take it to Trump and be the fighter he claims to be.\n\nNo single tweet, no statement, and no TV ad from Team Biden is going to put this to bed. Trump\u2019s thirst for a fight will only become more emboldened with Biden\u2019s silence. Biden must directly confront Trump if he hopes to win the nomination. Doing so will put every other Democratic contender in their shadows while he and Trump begin the inevitable slog to election day 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden can make this a two-person race, the election he asked for during his kickoff speech in May, but he must shed his over-calculated caution, openly defend his name, his family, and his candidacy and repeatedly confront Trump head-on.\n\nUntil Biden opens Trump\u2019s gift, the Trump fog machine will continue to choke him out and allow other candidates to vie for their own bare-knuckle fight with Trump.", "description": "Democratic primary voters consistently say they want a candidate who can take on Trump.
