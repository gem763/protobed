She even has a pet cat.\n\n(Image: Walt Disney)\n\nAs ever with Disney fantasies there's no lack of spectacle on screen, with the costumes, make-up, and locations breathtakingly rich in detail, and should be up for all the major awards.\n\nNewcomers such as Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ed Skrein play members of a threatened race, whose presence suggests a wider world for future films to explore.\n\n(Image: Walt Disney)\n\nThe first half scene-setting of politics and social oneupmanship may pass over the heads of very little kids, but there\u2019s always something great to look at, and the smaller woodland creatures are distractingly funny and super cute.\n\nPlus the second half is an exciting colourful battle which swoops about the turrets of a glorious castle, and the ending is everything you\u2019d expect from a Disney family movie.
