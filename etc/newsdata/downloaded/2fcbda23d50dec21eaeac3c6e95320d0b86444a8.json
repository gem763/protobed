He was berated by Hong Kong residents, received prank calls to his home and had his picture plastered on \u201cLennon Walls\u201d across the city.\n\nThe incident, however, gave Lau hero status in mainland China as a defender of law and order in the face of foreign backed troublemakers: He was invited to prime-time television shows, flooded with messages of support on Chinese social media and given red-carpet treatment when he arrived in Beijing for the parade. He was given preferential access to the Great Wall of China together with nine other officers, and scaled it with the Chinese flag held firmly in his right hand. The state press was there to cover it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe contrasting reactions to Lau after the incident underscores a new reality the Hong Kong police have to deal with. Here, they are seen increasingly as an occupying force, an arm of Beijing tasked with crushing the city\u2019s freedoms. In Beijing, they are seen as saviors and protectors of Chinese unity.\n\nHong Kong protester shot as police disperse anti-China demonstrations on National Day\n\nFor many protesters, China\u2019s warnings of military intervention are immaterial, as are fears of another Tiananmen-style crackdown: the oppressors are already here, and they are the Hong Kong Police Force.\n\nThe situation is likely to only worsen after officers fired live rounds at protesters on Tuesday. Some analysts now warn that this could be the start of years of unrest, and worry it could deteriorate into a situation comparable to places like Northern Ireland, where there was a complete breakdown between police and those they were meant to serve during the 1970s and 1980s and an increasing use of radical methods by protesters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe police actions in recent months have \u201cprofoundly damaged their standing in Hong Kong society while at the same time being utterly inefficient in the goal of actually curbing the protests,\u201d said Mike Chinoy, a Hong Kong-based nonresident senior fellow at the University of Southern California\u2019s US-China Institute and a former journalist who covered the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nA lack of political leadership, as well as mixed signals early on from police brass, meant the \u201cHong Kong police were being asked to solve on the street what is essentially a political problem,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Lau was enjoying the military firepower on display in Beijing \u2014 with a temporary tattoo of the Chinese flag on his hand \u2014 Hong Kong was descending into a new level of chaos. Despite warnings of violence and threats of arrest, protesters \u2014 both peaceful and those looking for a fight \u2014 gathered in half a dozen locations across the city.\n\nIn signs and chants, they rejected the notion that their semiautonomous city is anything like mainland China, pushed back on Beijing\u2019s control, and demanded free, direct elections for city leaders. Protests were sparked in June by a bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China, but have swelled into an all out rebuke of Hong Kong\u2019s political system where leaders are handpicked by and answerable to Beijing.\n\nDemonstrators are pushing for five demands, including an independent investigation of the police, but the government has only responded to the first demand, the full withdrawal of the bill.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA new escalation came when a riot officer shot an 18 year-old at close range in the chest, an apparent response to the protester hitting him with a bamboo stick, according to a video of the melee and the police. After he is shot and lying on the floor, surrounded by officers, a separate video shows another protester flinging a molotov cocktail at the group of police officers.\n\nAfter hearing about the shooting, prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong said in a tweet: \u201cThe true lesson Beijing learnt from 30 years ago is, perhaps, to ask someone else to undertake the butcher role,\u201d a reference to the use of Chinese army troops to crush the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy sit-in.\n\nAccording to police, 1,400 rounds of tear gas were fired on Tuesday, compared to just 150 canisters used in the June 12 protest at the start of the summer. Some 269 were arrested, raising the total detained to over 2,000. There were also 900 rubber bullets and six live rounds fired.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChina rolls out its military firepower with emphasis on \u2018Cold War-style\u2019 nuclear might\n\nThe Hong Kong police force was quick to defend the officer, who they say feared for his life, and said it was \u201csad\u201d that the situation has come to this.\n\n\u201cOur National Day is supposed to be a day to celebrate and be happy, but unfortunately some rioters choose to do all these sorts of criminal damages, arson, wounding, assaulting police officers and various behaviors, which are more or less equivalent to a riot offense,\u201d said Stephen Lo, commissioner for the Hong Kong Police Force, in a late-night news conference on Tuesday.\n\nYet, it was the gunshot wound through the chest of the protester, rather than the arson, petrol bombs and vandalism, that has left many here stunned and deeply worried about the future of their city, where police-involved shootings are rare and where the police force has for decades been respected and honored.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrancis Lee, director of the School of Communications and Journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the general public has remained sympathetic toward protesters despite \u201cheightened levels of violence\u201d because of perceptions both of government inaction and unresponsiveness, and because of \u201crepeated police misconduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this situation, many citizens find it hard to blame the protesters even if they might not feel entirely comfortable with some of the most violent tactics, such as the use of petrol bombs,\u201d said Lee.\n\nNumerous accounts from the demonstrations describe how residents often give shelter to protesters fleeing police.\n\nAD\n\nA public opinion survey from Lee\u2019s university shows the percentage of people who said they have no trust at all in the Hong Kong police has grown from 6.5 in early June \u2014 right before the start of the protests \u2014 to 48.3 in early September.\n\nAD\n\nProbably the most striking aspect of the ongoing #HKprotests is that ppl are rapidly losing trust in the police force. 48.3% of the ppl have ZERO trust in the police now. It was 6.5% before the protests started. No wonder ppl want an independent investigation. #StandwithHK pic.twitter.com/LbKysF4i6i \u2014 Leung Kai Chi \u6881\u555f\u667a (@LeungKaiChiHK) September 28, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, a spontaneous group marched through central Hong Kong in protest of the shooting, many of them apparently office workers in the city\u2019s financial district on their lunch break. The crowd grew to a few thousand. At one point, they collectively read out a post on a popular Hong Kong online messaging board, LIHKG, that said Hong Kongers are \u201cwise and have a conscience, and will never accept government lies or police rule\u201d over their city.\n\nEven before Tuesday, anger between residents and the police had been building. On Sunday, residents and restaurant workers emerged from the Wan Chai district to heckle and jeer at police, and throw bottles at their vans.\n\nAD\n\nAs riot officers marched down the street to clear protesters and make arrests, some residents followed behind, shouting vulgarities repeatedly and mocking them by making noises similar to a barking dog.\n\nAD\n\nMany police, like Lau, have turned instead to their admirers in mainland China for support. Lau began posting to the Chinese microblogging site Weibo in September, and has since amassed a fan base of more than 600,000. An introductory blurb on his profile simply says: I am Chinese.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, almost 500,000 people had liked Lau\u2019s post describing his experience on the Great Wall, which he described as \u201cmore spectacular\u201d than he could have imagined. Some praised him by the nickname they have adopted for the sergeant, Bald Lau Sir.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMainland Chinese people welcome you and all of your family, and other Hong Kong police officers like you!\u201d said one commenter. \u201cEnjoy the beautiful rivers and mountains of our beloved motherland!\u201d\n\nAt least 10 other Hong Kong police officers have recently opened verified Weibo accounts and been flooded with mainland praise, including, in one case, a marriage proposal.\n\nAD\n\nLau and other officers have also given frequent interviews to fawning Chinese state media. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, police at protests have called reporters \u201ccockroaches,\u201d accused them of being \u201cfake\u201d journalists and are increasingly blocking reporters from filming them in action.\n\nIn an interview with a Shanghai-based newspaper, Lau said he is mulling a move to mainland China, citing \u201cbetter values\u201d held by mainland Chinese students and worries over his children\u2019s safety.\n\nUnidentified flinching object: In Hong Kong protests, police wage assault on the facts\n\nHong Kong protesters target Beijing-friendly businesses in latest protest\n\nChinese leaders can\u2019t control the weather for their big 70-year bash. But they are still trying.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Yet while the police officers are despised in their own city, they have become heroes in mainland China.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Timothy Mclaughlin", "Tiffany Liang"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0AGziRzQnIyNF6iAyLFQWzo-hOs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TJYF4IXFAMI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg"}
