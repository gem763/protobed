He says it's harder than ever for a small business to get a loan \u2014 let alone a small internet business, which often don't have real estate or other physical assets to put up as collateral.\n\nRead more: The president of $20 billion Stripe explains how payments tech could 'change the trajectory of the internet economy'\n\nStripe Capital is generally best-suited for making loans of $10,000 to $20,000, Collison said. Those loans are backed by a banking partner, though Collison declined to share who that partner might be.\n\nThose amounts aren't much in the grand scheme, Collison said, but it can make all the difference in the universe for a company that needs to buy more servers or pull off a crucial marketing campaign to take things to the next level \u2014 a \"nitrous boost\" that can help a company \"take off a little bit faster.\"\n\nStripe Capital is open only to those who already use Stripe to take payments. That's important because as Collison notes, the company uses an applicant's history on the platform to make a data-driven decision on whether or not to approve the loan \u2014 the kind of data that a bank or other traditional lender might not have access to.\n\n\"We are looking at the corpus of businesses running on Stripe,\" Collison said, to make fast decisions. While he acknowledged that algorithms could introduce bias into any equation, he said that it was a game of give-and-take. After all, he said, Stripe's automated approach isn't prone to the proven biases of any human reviewer, and it can approve more applications, faster.\n\nWhat Stripe gets\n\nFor Stripe itself, Collison said that there were three major ways the company stood to benefit from moving into this new line of business.\n\nFirst off, Collison said, there's the interest paid on the loans themselves. Other companies like Square and Intuit have carved out lucrative niches for themselves in the moneylending business, though Stripe's focus on internet businesses helps set Stripe Capital apart, Collison said.\n\nSecond, there's the fact that it makes Stripe itself far more attractive as a vendor, Collison said. Stripe already offers its customers the Stripe Radar fraud-detection tool and benefits like chargeback protection. Adding the access to fast, easy capital is just one more reason why small businesses should choose Stripe, Collison said.\n\n\"We think this makes the overall Stripe proposition more compelling,\" he said.\n\nAnd finally, Collison said, there's the tie-in to Stripe's oft-repeated mission of increasing the GDP of the internet. Access to capital is a limiting factor for all kinds of online businesses, and the more Stripe can do to alleviate that burden, the better, Collison said. In so doing, it stands to increase both the number and scale of potential Stripe customers, he said.\n\n\"We think that Stripe will end up doing really well when we complete that mission,\" Collison said.", "description": "Stripe is perhaps best known as a payments processor, but it's getting into the moneylending business with Stripe Capital.", "authors": ["Matt Weinberger"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cb26f1353c7115e0a047b37-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
