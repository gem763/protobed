Last year more than 1,400 people wanted on European arrest warrants were held in the UK on behalf of police across Europe.\n\nIn the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK would lose access to the European arrest warrant and would have to rely on red notices issued by Interpol under the 1957 European convention on extradition.\n\nMartin said: \u201cAt the moment there is no domestic legislation for somebody who is wanted on the red notice. We would have to go and get a magistrate\u2019s warrant. What you could end up with is an officer being in an unenviable position where somebody in front of them is wanted overseas. Unless you have other grounds to detain them, you can\u2019t do anything about it. So what we are trying to do is close the loophole.\u201d\n\nPolice said they hoped the emergency law needed to plug the gap would be in the Queen\u2019s speech this month.\n\nMartin said at a briefing for journalists: \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing and advocating for it for some time. We\u2019ve been negotiating most of this year with the Home Office, it\u2019s just recently been drafted in the last few weeks and signed off by the home secretary.\u201d\n\nPolice said there had been a spike in hate crime in the second and fourth weeks of September, around the same time as key debates in Westminster about Brexit. Figures are expected to be released next week.\n\nPolice also said 26 out of 43 forces in England and Wales had restricted leave for officers in the run-up to the possible no-deal departure on 31 October. Two forces, Kent and Hampshire, have requested mutual aid, whereby officers from outside areas would be drafted in to help. Kent covers Dover and Hampshire covers ports including Portsmouth.\n\nNo-deal planning for police has cost \u00a326m so far and the final cost is expected to be far higher.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cNew legislation to create a power of arrest for Interpol red notices without having to apply to the court first will enhance policing capabilities regardless of the Brexit outcome.\u201d", "description": "Government must close loophole in law, says officer in charge of no-deal planning", "authors": ["Vikram Dodd"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fffa58f57a4d3d7d5ec598b08c7e4157b0111fa9/0_216_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=888c8a2568ba36e7e8ebd72742c1d72d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
