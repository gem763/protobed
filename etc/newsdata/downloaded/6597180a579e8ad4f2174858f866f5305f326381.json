The country\u2019s Perth Mint refinery is now releasing a new gold backed Ethereum token in western Australia.\n\nEthereum: Still the Blockchain of Choice\n\nKnown as the Perth Mint Gold Token (PMGT), it will be the first of its kind issued on a blockchain that\u2019s backed by government\u2019s reserves. A press release explains:\n\nIt offers institutional investors a competitive alternative to traditional gold products such as gold ETFs, with the additional benefits of real-time trading and settlement enabled by blockchain technology.\n\nMany are looking to attract institutional players to the digital token world thinking this will somehow legitimize the industry. However, this isn\u2019t necessarily true as we\u2019ve witnessed, and with the introduction of platforms like Bakkt, one is starting to wonder if maybe the idea of crypto and institutional investors working together is something of a myth.\n\nWith Bakkt, many touted the platform as a means of bringing legitimacy to the trading space. Many thought it would push bitcoin and crypto further into mainstream territory, but unfortunately, the tool was met with lackluster reception and failed to make any serious impact on the industry. Within 24 hours, less than 75 bitcoin futures contracts were traded on Bakkt, and the results were not good for the bitcoin price. The world\u2019s primary cryptocurrency ultimately dropped to roughly $8,100 from $9,500 within just a few short minutes.\n\nIn addition, building anything on the Ethereum network, at this stage, is somewhat questionable, considering the network\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently emerged to let people know that the blockchain wasn\u2019t scaling properly.\n\nIt appears that Ethereum has played host to too many applications and new crypto products. Ethereum is largely popular amongst blockchain product developers given its smart contracts capabilities, which has ultimately led to too many apps clogging up the network. This has resulted in very high gas prices and slow transaction times.\n\nOne of the big concerns regarding Australia\u2019s latest venture is the fact that the token will be bank-issued. This inherently makes it centralized, which goes against all the ideals and notions of cryptocurrency. Designed to alleviate customers from bank-based control, those who use crypto are given a chance to take charge of their own finances, but if the token is being issued by a financial institution, this control ultimately dissipates.\n\nWhat Could Digitizing Gold Really Do?\n\nStill, Perth Mint CEO Richard Hayes has high hopes for the token and believes it will do wonders for the industry.
