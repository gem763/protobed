Paul Jeffers\n\nFurthermore, the applicant argued that Myer breached its continous disclosure obligations \u2013 and so misled or deceived the market \u2013 by failing to update guidance by no later than November 11, 2015, when it knew its profit wouldn\u2019t hit the expected mark.\n\nBeach backed this view, setting out no less than seven points between November 21, 2014, and February 27, 2015, where Myer should have updated guidance.\n\n\u201cBy not having so corrected at each of these points in time, Myer engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct.\u201d\n\nNow that should have been great news for Elliott, who sat impassively though the short hearing on Thursday.\n\nBut Beach then dropped another bombshell: It\u2019s not clear that anyone suffered any loss from Myer\u2019s lack of disclosure, because the market didn\u2019t actually believe Brookes\u2019 forecast.\n\nEven in the days after Brookes predicted a profit above $98.5 million, the consensus of analysts on Bloomberg was for a profit of just $92 million \u2013 and in the view of Beach, this bearish view was built into the Myer share price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe applicant and group members may not have suffered any loss flowing from the contraventions that I have identified,\u201d Beach wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is because the market price for Myer securities at the time the contraventions occurred already factored in an NPAT well south of Mr Brookes\u2019 rosy picture painted on September 11, 2014.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the hard-edged scepticism of market analysts and market makers at the time of the contraventions had already deflated Mr Brookes\u2019 inflated views.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a bit of a blow for Bernie. But it\u2019s also a blow for Elliott, who after 12 months of hard graft finds himself facing even more work.\n\nWhile Beach wasn\u2019t convinced the entire group of investors in the action suffered a loss, he has left the door open for individuals to make a case that they did suffer a loss.\n\nPresumably, they will need to show they relied directly on Brookes\u2019 representations on the profit outlook for 2014-15, and not market consensus.\n\nThis may well require Elliott writing to each of them individually and then finding a way for them to make their own claim. So Myer isn\u2019t out of the woods yet.\n\nBut for those in the market closely watching this judgement, what does it all mean? Can boards and their advisers take Beach\u2019s judgment to mean that if a company misleads and no-one listens, the damage is minimal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProbably not.\n\nAt first blush, it seems Beach will force boards to reflect not only on the provision of guidance, but on how that guidance is interpreted by the market.\n\nBeach is clear that Myer should have made it clear in late November 2014 that Brookes' outlook statement was off the mark.\n\nBut the subsequent updates that Beach says should have been provided to the market are instructive. In each case, he appears to indicate that Myer should have taken into account not just its formal forecast, but where market consensus sat.\n\nAs mentioned, consensus for Myer\u2019s 2014-15 profit started at $92 million would subsequently fall to be at $89 million just before Myer dropped its profit downgrade bomb.\n\nBeach suggests that after telling the market in November that its profit would have been below the prior year, Myer should have said at a number of key points profit was likely below $90 million \u2013 that is, around where guidance sat.\n\nThis would appear to provide precedent to support the idea that a company can mislead not just by failing to correct guidance promptly, but also by failing to ensure market consensus is reasonable.", "description": "The verdict of the first ever shareholder class action can best be summed up with that most Australian of phrases: Yeah, nah.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_60/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7f88884436962a69a37ce669d2ef808222b294cd", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
