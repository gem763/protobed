COTODAMA makes two kinds of lyric speakers, both of which display a song\u2019s lyrics while music is playing.\n\nCOTODAMA\u2019s Lyric Speaker Canvas first came out last year and the original has a silver and black design. The silver back board is the actual speaker, while the black front board is the screen that displays song lyrics. It\u2019s one unit, but looks like two pieces, and is meant to evoke the idea of vinyl record jackets leaned up against your wall. The size is a bit bigger than an actual record sleeve, but not by much. The Lyric Speaker Canvas is 18.7 inches wide by 14.7 inches tall, so it\u2019s still pretty compact.\n\nWhen it plays music, the front panel links with databases like PetitLyrics to grab a song\u2019s lyrics. It then displays the lyrics in time with the song, and analyzes the song\u2019s mood to pick fonts and animations. Blocky text that bursts on the screen might be paired with a bold pop song, and a drifting, handwritten script would go with a slow ballad. If no lyrics can be found, the screen will show abstract animations that move in sync with the music instead. There\u2019s a nifty interactive demonstration on the COTODAMA website that lets you see how it visualizes lyrics for different kinds of songs.\n\nThe speaker connects via Wi-Fi with Airplay, Google Cast, and Spotify Connect on the iOS side, and Google Cast, and Spotify Connect if you have Android. If you\u2019re using Android, Amazon Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music are compatible, and the iOS version also supports Apple Music and a few other regional services like KK BOX.\n\nSaint Laurent x Cotodama made a new limited edition black on black lyric speaker that's meant to look like vinyl records and shut up and take my money pic.twitter.com/aidNlalDsX \u2014 Dani Deahl (@danideahl) July 19, 2019\n\nThis edition of the speaker has the same specs as the original, but comes with an all-black colorway and the Saint Laurent logo on the back panel. Slathering products entirely in black instantly makes them look more sleek, and this collaboration is no different. When Leica did an all-black Monochrom camera the result was gorgeous. The all-black OnePlus 3T was equally slick. It\u2019s also similar to another recent Saint Laurent collaboration, which took Bang & Olufsen Beoplay A9 and A1 speakers and drenched them in black.\n\nIf you want to grab this rare speaker, it costs several hundred dollars more than the original version, but in return you get the all-black aesthetic and Saint Laurent logo. The companies haven\u2019t said how many units will be produced, but it will set you back \u20ac1,995 ($2,241) and is only available at Saint Laurent Rive Droite stores in Los Angeles and Paris.", "description": "Japanese company COTODAMA and luxury brand Saint Laurent have teamed up for a limited edition all-black speaker that is only available to buy in the fashion house\u2019s Rive Droite stores.
