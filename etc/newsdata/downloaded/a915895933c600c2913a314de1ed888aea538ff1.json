Now. Just as we gave a billion dollars to Indonesia over a tsunami. This is a drought tsunami.'\n\nMr Morrison explained that he couldn't make it rain and that $318million has already helped in the past year.\n\n'The direct cash grant support is going into farming communities, including directly to farmers,' Mr Morrison said.\n\nBut Jones interrupted, saying: 'They're not getting it!'\n\nMr Morrison continued: 'Alan, if you could let me finish. There's $318.5 million...'\n\n'I don't know where the money is Prime Minister,' Jones interjected.\n\nAs Mr Morrison tried to make his point, Jones cut in with a blunt remark: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'\n\nMr Morrison continued trying to explain how aid has helped while a frustrated Jones kept interjecting and asking: 'How does that feed a cow?'\n\nJones then criticised the Farm Household Allowance scheme, which gives farmers fortnightly payments and, in some cases, lump sum payments of up to $12,000.\n\nJones (pictured) angrily interrupted the PM several times during the interview\n\n'You say Farm Household Allowance. Now PM, come on. You go and tell Jenny that she can live on $250 a week,' Jones said.\n\n'It's not $250 a week Alan. It's not just that,' Mr Morrison replied.\n\n'If you live in the city, and your business goes bust or you lose your job, then you have access to Newstart. But if you are on a farm property and you get access to the Farm Household Allowance.'\n\nJones did not accept his answer and pressed the PM further by asking: 'Why are they walking off? Why are they sending their cattle to slaughter?'\n\n'Because of the drought, that's why,' said the PM.\n\nMr Morrison then admitted he couldn't save farmers from some hardship.\n\n'The government, whether it's state, federal or anyone else, we can do a lot of things to try and help people get through this. But the government can't make it rain, and it can't make life as it was before the drought,' he said.\n\n'We both want the same thing. We want the farmers to be able to get through this drought. But we can't kid ourselves that there's a magic wand and a magic cash splash that's going to make this thing totally solved.'\n\nAt times during the interview, Jones became exasperated as he repeatedly interrupted the Prime Minister and sighed and tutted when Mr Morrison spoke.\n\nDespite Jones' combative stance, 2GB listeners said they were disappointed by the Prime Minister.\n\nOne said: 'My blood's boiling after hearing that. Complete failure as a Prime Minister. He's arrogant. They've been conning the public after the election.'\n\nAnother added: 'I'm a dairy farmer's daughter. That interview should sign the end of his Prime Ministership. Just absolutely diabolical.'\n\nAn aerial view of a severely drought affected farm 40km north-east of Coonabarabran, NSW\n\nThe tense interview came after Mr Morrison was in Tamworth on Sunday with Premier Gladys Berejiklian to announce a $1billion investment in dams and water infrastructure projects around New South Wales.\n\nThe 50/50 investment includes a $480million new Dungowan Dam near Tamworth, along with a a $650million upgrade of Wyangala Dam in the NSW Central West.\n\n'I love working with premiers that want to build dams,' a beaming prime minister told reporters.\n\n'And not just say they want to do it but are actually going to do it and roll-up their sleeves and ensure that we can get these built.'\n\nSuch infrastructure will aid regional and rural communities build drought resistance into the future.\n\nThe joint venture will also help free-up NSW funding to allow progress for critical town water projects across the state.\n\n'We want to get these projects underway because this is about water supply and security,' Mr Morrison said.\n\n'These projects don't happen overnight but we're working as quickly as possible to get all the necessary work done so we can start digging.'\n\nA boat ramp leads to the drought-affected Split Rock Dam near Tamworth in rural Australia\n\nMs Berejiklian estimated the new dam will take about four years to build.\n\nThere will also be an initial $24 million 50/50 investment for the proposed 100,000-megalitre Border Rivers project on the Mole River, near the Queensland border.\n\nMs Berejiklan described the announcements as 'historic' given the last dam built in NSW was in 1987.\n\nBut Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese was unimpressed by such promises after six years of federal coalition governments.\n\n'Tony Abbott's come and gone, Malcolm Turnbull's come and gone, Barnaby Joyce's come and gone, Scott Morrison's there, they haven't dug a hole yet,' Mr Albanese told reporters in Sydney.\n\n'Well wait and see what happens.What I do know is that this government has no national drought strategy.'\n\nThe Nature Conservation Council also warned the NSW government to retain thorough assessment of water infrastructure projects to avoid ecological catastrophes, like the mass fish kills earlier this year.\n\n'We need thorough assessment of water infrastructure projects now more than ever to ensure we don't make matters worse,' the council's chief executive Chris Gambian said in a statement.\n\n'The problems we are facing today are a direct result of this government refusing to listen to its own planning experts, who warned of this looming water crisis six years ago.'", "description": "In one particularly heated moment, the radio host interrupted Mr Morrison and bluntly told him: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'", "authors": ["Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/19716816-0-image-a-40_1571097408808.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
