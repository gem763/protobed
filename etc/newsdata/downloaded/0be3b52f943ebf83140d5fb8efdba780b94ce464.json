These updates will come with annual fee increases for most of the cards, but none of the fees will jump by much, and it could be well worth paying a bit more to get the new perks.\n\nThe Delta card updates won't take effect until January 30, 2020, but upon announcing these upcoming changes in early October, Delta and Amex also launched three limited-time welcome bonuses. New cardholders can currently earn more miles than usual \u2014 up to 75,000 miles \u2014 when they apply for the Gold Delta, Platinum Delta, and Delta Reserve cards, but these offers are only available until October 30, so it's your last chance to apply.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which will far outweigh the value of any points or miles. It's important to practice financial discipline when using credit cards by paying your balances in full each month, making payments on time, and only spending what you can afford to pay back.\n\nRead more: Gold, Platinum, or Reserve? We break down which Delta Amex credit card gets flyers the most value\n\nThe Gold Delta Amex has the lowest annual fee of the three cards: $95, and it's waived the first year. However, it will increase to $99 for applications received on or after January 30, 2020.\n\nUntil October 30, the card's offering a welcome bonus of 60,000 miles. To earn this, new cardholders will need to spend $2,000 in the first three months. If they make a Delta purchase in the first three months, they can also receive a $50 statement credit.\n\nRead more: Gold Delta Amex card review\n\nAlong with a slightly increased annual fee, in January 2020 the Gold Delta Amex will add new bonus categories that earn 2x miles: purchases at US supermarkets and at restaurants. This is in addition to the 2x miles you'll earn on Delta purchases, and it means the card could be worth a more permanent spot in your wallet, rather than it being the option you use for booking Delta flights and nothing else.\n\nOther upcoming changes to the Gold Delta card include a $100 Delta flight credit when you spend $10,000 on the card in a year, and the removal of the discounted Delta Sky Club access benefit. Additionally, the card will no longer be eligible for the Medallion Qualification Dollar waiver \u2014 with more premium Delta cards, if you spend $25,000 or more in a year, you can waive the MQD requirement for Delta elite status up to Platinum status.\n\nThe Gold Delta Amex, along with the Platinum Delta and Delta Reserve cards, also offers you a first bag checked for free on Delta as long as you connect your SkyMiles account to your credit card account.\n\nThe Platinum Delta Amex is the more premium of the two cards, with a $195 annual fee that isn't waived the first year. It's currently offering 75,000 bonus miles and 5,000 Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) after you spend $3,000 in the first three months, and a $100 statement credit when you make a Delta purchase in the first three months.\n\nBeyond a higher welcome bonus, the Platinum Delta Amex offers additional benefits compared to the Gold Delta card, including the ability to earn MQMs, which are part of the qualification requirement for Delta Medallion elite status, and an annual companion certificate for main cabin travel on Delta \u2014 essentially a two-for-one travel certificate, and you only have to pay for taxes and fees.\n\nRead more: Platinum Delta Amex review\n\nThe Platinum Delta card is getting one of the more significant makeovers among Delta Amex cards. In 2020, its annual fee will increase to $250, but it will also earn 3x miles (up from 2x) on Delta purchases, plus 2x miles at restaurants and US supermarkets. It will also add an application fee credit of up to $100 for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.\n\nThe highest-end consumer credit card in Delta's lineup, the Delta Reserve Amex, is offering an elevated welcome bonus of 75,000 miles and 10,000 MQMs when new cardholders spend $5,000 in the first three months.\n\nThis card will also get a hefty annual fee increase in 2020: Currently, the fee is $450, but for applications received on or after January 30, 2020, it will jump to $550. One of the Delta Reserve card's standout benefits is free Delta Sky Club access when you're flying Delta, and a Delta Sky Club membership costs $545, so some cardholders may find it's still worth it.\n\nThe Reserve's adding plenty of new perks in 2020, too. It will offer American Express Centurion Lounge access when you're flying Delta, two one-time Sky Club guest passes, 3x miles on Delta purchases, and access to complimentary upgrades for cardholders without Delta elite status. Like the Platinum Delta Amex, it will also offer up to a $100 statement credit to cover the cost of Global Entry or PreCheck.", "description": "Until October 30, the Gold, Platinum, and Reserve Delta Amex cards are offering elevated welcome bonuses of up to 75,000 miles.", "authors": ["Sarah Silbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db05b7ccc4a0a660245b8d3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
