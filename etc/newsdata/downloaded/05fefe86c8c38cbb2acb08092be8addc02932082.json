They say the rest of his arteries were normal.\n\nThe doctors said the rest of his stay was \"uneventful with good expected progress.\"\n\nThis marks the second time in two months that health problems forced Sanders to cancel campaign events. In September, he backed out of some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice.", "description": "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is leaving Las Vegas and returning home to Vermont after being treated for a heart attack.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
