He said he has a contact named 'Jenni', she is having problems with her vehicle and I must make contact with her. I can confirm that I met her on two or three occasions,\" he explained to the commisssion.\n\nNaidoo said that he met with Munusamy for the first time at an Engen Garage near her home, where she handed over the keys to her vehicle.\n\n\"She knew who I was. Commissioner Mphego sent me. She handed me the keys and I took the car to New World Motors under the instruction of General [Solly] Lazarus (former Crime Intelligence chief financial officer).\n\n\"The new tyres were replaced, the car was serviced, the radio was faulty and one of the seats in the car needed attention,\" he said.\n\nThe vehicle was subsequently returned to Munusamy by Naidoo, but he then received another call from Mphego regarding the vehicle.\n\n\"It was probably a week or two later when I got a call from Mphego and inquired why we did not put run flat tyres on the vehicle., I arranged to pick the vehicle back up again took it to New World Motors \u2013 had those tyres fitted on and took it back to her,\" he told the commission.\n\nNaidoo did not say what, if anything, was expected from Munusamy in return for the alleged assistance.\n\nMunusamy made headlines after senior Hawks investigator Colonel Kobus Roloefse previously revealed to the inquiry that the Hawks were able to uncover an amount of R143 621 78 - paid from the Atlantis Motors business account to a Wesbank vehicle finance account in the settlement agreement of the vehicle in the name of Munusamy - during an investigation into the alleged looting of the secret service account within Crime Intelligence, News24 reported.\n\nALSO READ: Journalist Ranjeni Munusamy placed on special leave after slush fund allegations made at Zondo commission\n\nMunusamy intends to defend herself against the allegations, News24 reported.\n\n\"I deny the allegations made against me at the Zondo commission today. They are baseless. I am working with my lawyers to draft a response to the allegations for the commission, with whom I am cooperating fully,\" she previously said.\n\nNaidoo detailed two other instances where journalists - who were not named - were paid R25 000 to make a story \"detrimental to intelligence\" disappear and where another journalist - who also wasn't named - was paid by an unknown figure under the alleged instruction of Lazarus.\n\nThe inquiry continues.", "description": "Police whistleblower Dhanajaya Naidoo has told the Zondo commission that several journalists, including Sunday Times associate editor Ranjeni Munusamy, were paid by Crime Intelligence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3314/eee88f9993f0446a8bd5111c9be90372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
