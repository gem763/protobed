Jamil says she hopes her I Weigh platform can provide a voice to a network of activists and reinvent how people perceive their bodies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not actually body positivity,\u201d Jamil recently told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe Ticker.\u201d \u201cBody positivity is a socio-political movement that exists for women who are larger who get discriminated against medically and in society because of their size. We are more of a body neutrality movement where we teach to not focus whatsoever on size\u2026 We are trying to encourage people to find their self esteem and worth outside of how little space they physically take up in the world.\u201d\n\n\u2018Really dangerous diet and detox products\u2019\n\nThe actress is building I Weigh from an Instagram account \u2014 which currently has nearly 860,000 followers \u2014 to an activist-driven company with a full staff. Jamil says body image issues specifically affect women, because dieting products are particularly geared toward female consumers. And Instagram\u2019s community of roughly 1 billion users has provided exposure to diet products with unintended consequences with the backing of celebrities like the Kardashians.\n\nCast member Jameela Jamil answers questions during the panel for \"The Good Place\" at the NBC Universal Television Critics Association press tour in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. August 2, 2016.

They didn\u2019t foresee it becoming this marketplace for really dangerous diet and detox products being sold on social media.\u201d\n\nIn a 2016 study of 1,765 adults between 19 and 32 years old conducted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, participants who spent the most time on social media each day were 2.2 times more likely to report body image issues. Meanwhile, a 2017 survey of 1,000 men and women found that 88% of women say they compare themselves to images in the media.\n\n\u2018A very big dent in the dark side of the diet industry\u2019\n\nJamil says she is \u201cwaging war\u201d against the diet industry. A recent petition she started on the dangerous side effects of diet and detox products gained 250,000 signatures in its first three days.\n\n\u201cI was able to take that to Instagram\u2019s headquarters and say \u2018I\u2019m either going to do this with you or without you, so you can work with me and we can do this together,\u2019\u201d Jamil says. \u201cAnd they chose to go with me because I\u2019m so annoying and they do genuinely seem to care about the mental health of young people.\u201d\n\nLast week Facebook (FB) and the photo-sharing site it owns, Instagram, unveiled a new policy focused on products including detox teas, diet pills, and even appetite-suppressing lollipops. Under the new rules, posts that promote weight loss products or cosmetic procedures will be prohibited from being viewed by users under 18.\n\nBut Jamil says that is just the beginning of her mission.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a very big dent in the dark side of the diet and the detox industry,\u201d she explains. \u201cReally I only got into this business so I could use it to whistleblow on all of the terrible things that are happening to young people. If anything, they\u2019ve been amplified because of how effective social media is at spreading good things, but also a lot of toxicity.\u201d\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman speaks with \"The Good Place\" actress Jameela Jamil on her I Weigh initiative to combat diet and detox products on social media.", "authors": ["Meghan Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wW4vLvbMAsn_wYxXTpKHBA--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/8eeb0e40-dd8c-11e9-b727-86d1151cd384", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
