Then he had a better idea.\n\n\u201cI asked her if she wanted to paint my nails,\u201d said Lloyd, 48, who has been with the North Davis Fire District for 19 years. \u201cShe absolutely lit up.\u201d\n\nThe girl, still strapped in her seat, started slathering purple polish on his nails and fingers.\n\nThat was when Battalion Chief Allen Hadley, also a 19-year-veteran, showed up to check on the scene.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cKevin had calmed her down and was in the process of getting his fingers painted,\u201d said Hadley, 42. \u201cThen I just put my hand in there.\u201d\n\nThe girl obliged, and she began to color Hadley\u2019s nails pink.\n\nBy this time, she was not only calm, but she was also happy.\n\n\u201cEvery time she\u2019d switch colors she\u2019d get really excited,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cI think she would have painted our toes if we let her.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother, who was about 12 weeks pregnant, was evaluated and was not injured, they said. She thanked them for helping her daughter feel better, and they all chuckled at the firefighters\u2019 nails and took some photos.\n\nThe firefighters, who both have daughters, said the moment reminded them of when their girls were small and used to paint their nails.\n\nAD\n\nThey brought the photos back to headquarters and showed them around. The department put them up on Facebook, and thousands of people responded, with many thanking the firefighters for going out of their way to calm down a terrified girl. In the Facebook post, the department called it \u201cawesome customer service to one of our young citizens.\u201d That, and the photos of the firefighters\u2019 manicures, were picked up by several media outlets.\n\nAD\n\nNorth Davis Fire District Fire Chief Mark Becraft said he has been surprised at all the attention. He said he\u2019s proud of his firefighters, and added that he has known members of the department who have hoisted a horse out of a ditch and others who stopped on their way back from a call to spontaneously help an elderly woman mow her lawn. Those things aren\u2019t part of the job, he said, but happen more frequently than people know.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to hear people still care,\u201d Becraft said.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the fact, Lloyd and Hadley had a small matter to tend to: the layers of polish heaped on their nails. They bought a bottle of nail polish remover, and used almost all of it.\n\n\u201cMine took close to an hour to get off with Q-Tips and elbow grease,\u201d Lloyd said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The firefighter saw the crying little girl was clutching several bottles of nail polish and asked her what colors they were.
