That\u2019s actually down one from last Friday, when Nevada Republican Mark Amodei made headlines as the first member of the House Republican caucus to back the inquiry.\n\nBut the backlash was swift, and the moderate Republican, who serves as Trump\u2019s campaign chair in Nevada, has repeatedly clarified his remarks in an attempt to thread what\u2019s becoming an impossible needle for some Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe trouble for Amodei started Friday when he told reporters that it makes sense for Congress to look into the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint regarding Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cListen, I want to see what the process produces,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd quite frankly, if there\u2019s something there that rises to that level, then guess what, that\u2019s not something that we can have by a Democrat or a Republican.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing government agencies to, if it\u2019s proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it turns out that it\u2019s something along those lines, then there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nThe headlines declaring Amodei the first backer of the impeachment inquiry followed.\n\nThe first Republican House member has announced support for the impeachment inquiry against President Trump: Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada\n\n\n\nSee the full list: https://t.co/nnYylNUBSA pic.twitter.com/7SUfyj48Sq \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) September 27, 2019\n\nBut the reaction from Team Trump was not far behind. On Twitter, Amodei was called a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cchicken shit RINO.\u201d Corey Lewandowski tweeted that it\u2019s time for a Trump \u201csupporter to challenge Amodei in a primary.\u201d And before Friday was over, Amodei was on the phone with acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney explaining his position. He spoke with House Republican leaders Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise too. Then he put out a statement that included the quote: \u201cIn no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Amodei sought to further clear his name in an interview with Breitbart News. He repeatedly said he does not support an \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d but he does support congressional investigations into the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint. Which is to say, he supports what many House Democrats do, an investigation of Trump\u2019s action related to Ukraine that will inform a vote on articles on impeachment.\n\nBut this is an increasingly untenable position for Republicans. If they express any concerns over the whistle-blower complaint that Trump has trashed, or the phone call that Trump has deemed \u201cbeautiful,\u201d they\u2019ll be pegged as supporting an impeachment inquiry. And so most Republicans have chosen two paths to avoid the headlines Amodei got \u2014 echo Trump, or say nothing at all.", "description": "Mark Amodei, a Nevada congressman, appeared to come out in favor of the House impeachment inquiry last week \u2013 but then he backed off.", "authors": ["Adam K.
