And that fact apparently kept them from signing CFL quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell.\n\nVia 3downnation.com, Mitchell recently said that he worked out last December for the Vikings, after being named the CFL\u2019s Most Outstanding Player. Coach Mike Zimmer, according to Mitchell, was present.\n\nAfter the workout, an unnamed team official met with Mitchell and asked how he could help the Vikings win.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Well, for one, I\u2019ve never been anywhere in football and not won a championship as a starter,'\u201d Mitchell said. \u201c\u2018High school, DI, DI-AA, now here in the CFL. Everywhere I\u2019ve ever been I\u2019ve won a championship within the first three years I\u2019ve been there. I can help you do that. I\u2019m going to come in here, I\u2019m going to take Kirk\u2019s job.'\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t what the Vikings wanted to hear, according to Mitchell.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018Oh, no, no, n-n-n-no, we don\u2019t want you to take Kirk\u2019s job. We want you to come in here, help him with his eyes, tell him what you see, do everything you can to make him a better quarterback. But we need a good quarterback room, we don\u2019t want you to cause controversy. At that moment I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not signing with the Minnesota Vikings.\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand that thought process. All that tells me is there\u2019s a culture in that building right now that, \u2018Hey, your job is secure because of the money we paid you. Don\u2019t worry about anything you do or the decisions you make or anything the media says, just do what we tell you to do and you\u2019re going to be fine.\u2019 It\u2019s mind-blowing. You don\u2019t even want a guy that\u2019s pushing him or creating competition.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Mitchell\u2019s version of the events may indeed be accurate, the Vikings wouldn\u2019t be the only team that wants a backup quarterback who knows his place. There\u2019s a way to push the starter and to create competition without having a clear and open effort by the backup to supplant the guy who holds the job.\n\nRegardless of the manner in which Mitchell interpreted the message from the Vikings, the contract given to Cousins says it all. Three years, $84 million, fully guaranteed. It\u2019s his job, unless and until the Vikings decide that they\u2019ve had enough, and that they\u2019re willing to pay all or part of his $29.5 million salary in 2020 for him to go away.\n\nDepending on what happens over the course of the next 12 games, that could be what happens.", "description": "The Vikings are stuck with quarterback Kirk Cousins through 2020.
