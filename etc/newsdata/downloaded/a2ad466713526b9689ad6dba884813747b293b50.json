It would also thrust Israel into further political turmoil and drag out policy paralysis at a time when diplomatic and regional security challenges are mounting.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s nationalist Likud and former military chief Benny Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White are running neck and neck, the exit polls indicated. But each would need to bring in governing partners, and neither has the support of 61 of parliament\u2019s 120 lawmakers, the polls showed. The political horsetrading will be hot and heavy in coming days as Netanyahu, who is battling corruption charges, and Gantz each try to line up the most support. There\u2019s also pressure to yoke their parties in a national unity government, a move that might require Netanyahu to step aside -- or be forced out.\n\nWhile the exit surveys suggest Netanyahu, popularly known as Bibi, may lose his grip on power, it\u2019s too early to eulogize him. Netanyahu is known as \u201cthe magician\u201d for his deft political maneuvering, and he\u2019s likely to try to peel away some supporters of the center-left camp.\n\n\u201cThe results here are less good for him than in April; and in April he didn\u2019t make a government,\u201d Simon Davies, a pollster and political consultant for Number 10 Strategies, said of Netanyahu. \u201cWhichever way you look at it -- if the exit polls are right -- Bibi is not in a great position. Bibi is a consummate politician, though, and you\u2019d never put it past him to get out of any situation.\u201d\n\nTo follow our Live Blog, click here\n\nBy 5:35 a.m., only 26% of the votes had been counted, showing Likud with a narrow lead over Blue & White. After a near-final tally is released Thursday, President Reuven Rivlin will consult with the various parties to see whom they recommend he tap to form a government.\n\nThe exit polls position former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, an on-again, off-again Netanyahu ally, to become this election\u2019s kingmaker. Liberman\u2019s objection to military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jewish men led to the collapse of coalition talks after the April 9 election, propelling Netanyahu to engineer a revote rather than let a rival try to put together a government.\n\nIn other worrisome news for Netanyahu, the Joint List of Arab parties is poised to become parliament\u2019s third-largest faction, increasing its representation and eating into the bloc allied with the prime minister, the exit polls showed. It hasn\u2019t ruled out recommending to Rivlin that Gantz form the government, a Joint List spokesman said. Throughout Israel\u2019s 71-year history, Arab parties -- which reject Israel\u2019s identity as the Jewish state -- have never sat in government, though some Arab lawmakers have served in Knesset on behalf of Zionist parties.\n\nGamble Backfired\n\nA defiant Netanyahu told cheering supporters at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv that he would enter into negotiations with prospective coalition partners \u201cto form a strong Zionist government\u201d and block a coalition that would rely on the support of the Joint List, which represents Arabs who constitute about 20% of Israel\u2019s population. The crowd chanted, \u201cBibi, king of Israel,\u201d and, \u201cWe don\u2019t want unity!\u201d\n\nPolitical newcomer Gantz ran a clean-hands campaign that, while lackluster, resonated with voters desperate for an alternative to Netanyahu, who has won four successive terms since 2009. Netanyahu was unseated after his first term in 1999 by another former military chief, Ehud Barak.\n\nGantz stopped short of declaring victory but told a cheering crowd that \u201ctonight, no matter how it evolves, begins the journey to repair Israeli society.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolarization and divisions are behind us, and unity and reconciliation are before us,\u201d he said, vowing to work to set up a national unity government. He\u2019s repeatedly said he would not team up with Netanyahu while he faces corruption allegations.\n\nWith his political survival at stake, Netanyahu appealed to his nationalist base with pledges dear to their hearts, such as vowing to annex West Bank territory claimed by Palestinians, and painting the liberal left and Israeli Arab leaders as bogeymen. That continued on voting day, when he convened what was billed as an emergency party meeting amid reports of high turnout in Arab and liberal areas of the country.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Israel\u2019s election do-over looked set to produce a dramatic deadlock between legally embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political opponents, with no clear sign who will form the country\u2019s next government.The lack of a decisive victory would be a setback for Israel\u2019s longest-serving", "authors": ["Amy Teibel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/57d4lkAkf8dOekTXjbmvxQ--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/3e5f044d866f427fd8ff2467eb6d71e6", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
