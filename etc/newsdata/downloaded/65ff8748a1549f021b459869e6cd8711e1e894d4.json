Developing Great Keppel Island is key to the region's tourism future,\" Mr Ludwig said.\n\n\"All the approvals are in place, but it needs someone to invest in and then activate the island. We are very keen to see it resolved.\"\n\nHowever, Altum's ability to develop a circa-$400 million resort has already been questioned by local groups, given it has to date only developed apartments, townhouse and residential estates and has no experience in delivering tourism projects.\n\nThe previous decaying resort on the island was demolished last year to make way for the new development.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Great Keppel was a famed party destination known by the slogan \"Get Wrecked on Keppel\".\n\nMr Agnew's Tower Holding's paid $16.5 million in 2008 for the island before shutting it down and unveiling plans for a $2.5 billion luxury resort shortly afterwards.\n\nHowever, numerous previous attempts to sell it proved unsuccessful.", "description": "Altum Property Group has exchanged contracts to acquire the leasehold but is awaiting approval from the Queensland government.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0bed2cd8869be5d6d0cda6a2b5ebf2e62761b838", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
