We are working towards that,\u201d Ms. Lahren said on Twitter.\n\nMs. Lahren\u2019s tweet was accompanied by a statement attributed to Amy Robbins, Alexo Athletica\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\n\u201cWe had to make a decision that millions of American companies, especially small businesses have to make, when starting a business and go with the America based company that happened to have their manufacturing facilities overseas,\u201d said the statement.\n\n\u201cDue to the increased labor costs and heightened regulations many US based manufacturers face we were left with little option but to manufacture overseas to start out,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMs. Lahren announced the athleisure line a week earlier, tweeting: \u201cFor those who love God, Guns and Country and are proud to show it. Freedom\u201d\n\n\u201cMy line is tailored to women of any age and any size, and it\u2019s very patriotic,\u201d she told Recoil last week. \u201cWe have camouflage prints, we have stars, and it\u2019s an interesting take on a lot of the traditional patriotic symbols. It looks very much like me.\u201d\n\nNeither Ms. Lahren nor Ms. Robbins acknowledged where the apparel is made.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
