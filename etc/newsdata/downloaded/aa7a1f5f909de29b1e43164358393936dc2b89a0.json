Don't recognise her from the glimpse of her photo.\"\n\nAnother tweeted: \"Knew Nate was Cain's son I think Faith has found that out now in the picture in Nate's caravan.\"\n\nA third agreed: \"There's no way we know Nate's mum so that history we have not seen. #Emmerdale excitement or what?\"\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode at 8pm on Thursdays.", "description": "Emmerdale fans think they've seen a first glimpse of Nate Robinson's mum, after the reveal he was Cain Dingle's son", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706823.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_emmerdale.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
