(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump campaign threatened to sue a Minneapolis arena for passing along a half-million-dollar security bill from the city to cover costs of the president\u2019s political rally there later this week.\n\nMinneapolis officials told the Target Center, where Trump is slated to appear on Thursday night, that it would be responsible for the $530,000 the city says it will need to beef up security for President Trump\u2019s visit. The Target Center then passed the bill along to the Trump campaign and said the campaign would have to pay it or it could not use the arena.\n\nThe ensuing battle over the security fees has infuriated the Trump team, which is accusing Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of trying to block Trump\u2019s visit.\n\nTrump slammed Frey in a tweet Tuesday morning, calling him a \u201clightweight.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, accused Frey of \u201cabusing his power.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s legal team sent the Target Center\u2019s parent company, AEG Management, a letter Monday declaring that refusing to allow Trump to hold his event there would be a breach of contract. The letter said the Trump campaign \u201cwill aggressively pursue all remedies available to it in law or equity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement accompanying the public release of the letter, Parscale accused Frey of extortion by \u201cconjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe radical Mayor of Minneapolis, @Jacob_Frey, is abusing his power in an attempt to block the President\u2019s supporters from seeing him speak on Thursday,\u201d Parscale tweeted Tuesday morning with a map of Minnesota showing the counties Trump won in 2016. \u201cWe refuse to be bullied by a left-winger resister & won\u2019t let him stifle the speech of @realDonaldTrump or his supporters!\u201d\n\nTrump retweeted his campaign manager and wrote: \u201cThe lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!\u201d Trump\u2019s rally is to be held in the congressional district of Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nFrey, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, responded to the president\u2019s tweet shortly thereafter.\n\n\u201cYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors,\u201d Frey tweeted back.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter Trump announced his intent to visit the city, Frey said in a statement that while there was \u201cno legal mechanism to prevent the president from visiting, his message of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\u201d", "description": "City officials want the arena to pay back security costs associated with Trump\u2019s visit.
