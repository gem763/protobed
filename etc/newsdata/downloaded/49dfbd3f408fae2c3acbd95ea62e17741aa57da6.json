Police arrested a man shortly after the attack.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, chief federal prosecutor Peter Frank said that the suspect \u2014 a 27-year-old German man named as Stephan B. \u2014 had planned a \"massacre\" in the synagogue and had been motivated by anti-Semitic and racist ideology.\n\n\"What we experienced yesterday was terror,\" he added.\n\nFrank said the suspect, who live-streamed the shooting online, had wanted to inspire further attacks. He is accused of two counts of murder and nine counts of attempted murder.\n\nIt is still uncertain how he was radicalized, how he was able to build weapons and explosives, and whether he had supporters, the prosecutor added.\n\nOfficials have not released details on the two victims. According to the German press agency DPA, a 40-year-old woman was killed in front of the synagogue while a 20-year-old man was killed in a nearby kebab shop after the gunman failed to enter the synagogue.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Horst Seehofer and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited the site of the attack on Thursday.\n\nIn a press conference, Seehofer described the shooting as \"a disgrace for our country,\" adding: \"Given our history, something like this cannot be allowed to happen in Germany.\"\n\nSeehofer said he planned to increase security around synagogues and Jewish institutions, and hire additional staff in security agencies. He added: \"We need to tackle [online] hate speech.\"\n\nThe leader of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, criticized that no police officers had been guarding the synagogue on Yom Kippur. Had the attacker managed to enter the synagogue, \"we would have had to mourn 60 deaths,\" he said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking at a union conference on Thursday, said she was \"shocked and depressed\" over the attack. \"There could have been many more victims,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \"I have said it yesterday ... and I will say it again here: We are glad for every synagogue, for every Jewish community and for all Jewish life in our country.\"", "description": "A shooting on Yom Kippur in the city of Halle left two people dead.", "authors": ["Louise Guillot"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174971852-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
