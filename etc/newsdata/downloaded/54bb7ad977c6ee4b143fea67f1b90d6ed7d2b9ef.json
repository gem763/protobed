Shortly after, fans started speculating that the track could be about her messy breakup with ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber.\n\nThe Disney Channel alum and the pop star \u2014 famously dubbed \u201cJelena\u201d as a couple \u2014 had been locked in an on-and-off love story for the ages, briefly rekindling their romance until splitting last year, shortly before Bieber started dating his now-wife, Hailey Bieber.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that fans are decoding Gomez\u2019s new track in reference to the split, as she teased that the song was inspired by \u201cmany things that have happened in my life\u201d since releasing her last album, \u201cRevival,\u201d four years ago.\n\n\u201cI thought it was important to share the music, as I know many can relate to the fact that the road to self-discovery generally comes through the scars in one\u2019s life,\u201d Gomez said in a statement of the new single. \u201cI want people to feel hope and to know you will come out the other side stronger and a better version of yourself.\u201d\n\nAnd her lyrics appear to reference how quickly Justin Bieber rebounded after their split.\n\n\u201cI gave my all and they all know it / You tore me down and now it\u2019s showing,\u201d Gomez sings on the track. \u201cIn two months you replaced us / Like it was easy / Made me think I deserved it / In the thick of healing.\u201d\n\nMonths after their breakup, Gomez sought treatment in October to help address her ongoing struggle with anxiety and depression following recent hospitalizations related to her Lupus and her kidney transplant. She\u2019s since been on a journey of healing and become increasingly vocal with her fans about mental health issues.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber arrive at the 2011 American Music Awards.\n\nElsewhere, on the song fans believe she calls out Justin Bieber once again, referencing his 2015 album, \u201cPurpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw the signs and I ignored it,\u201d Gomez sings. \u201cRose-colored glasses all distorted / Set fire to my purpose / And I let it burn.\u201d\n\nAnd to make matters even messier, Hailey Bieber was dragged into the drama after fans claimed she was slighting Gomez on the night of the song\u2019s release.\n\nShortly after \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d dropped, Hailey Bieber shared a screenshot of the song \u201cI\u2019ll Kill You\u201d from R&B artist Summer Walker\u2019s new album, which some interpreted as a dig in Gomez\u2019s direction.\n\nSelena Gomez dropped an honest and vulnerable song roastingJustin Bieber and minutes later Hailey Baldwin\u2019s posts this lmaooooooineedtogotobed pic.twitter.com/WCOmGLTxVq \u2014 CK (@ckmont) October 23, 2019\n\nI'm not trying to start any drama and I've never talked about Hailey Baldwin before I have neutral feelings for her first, I've never believed the things that Selenators says about her until now, I mean it's not a coincidence to post this story right after the song is dropped -1 \u2014 \ud83d\udc0d Ayah \ud83e\udd8b (@gomezsyria) October 23, 2019\n\nBut Hailey Bieber \u2014 who, let the record show, once stanned Gomez and Justin Bieber together \u2014 has since spoken out, explaining that her post was in no way connected to her husband\u2019s ex-girlfriend.\n\n\u201cPlease stop with this nonsense,\u201d Hailey Bieber told Just Jared about the controversy. \u201cThere is no \u2018response.\u2019 This is complete BS.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSorry\u201d singer has yet to comment on Gomez\u2019s new song, though he posted an image of what seems to be a cheetah with part of its face covered in blood on Instagram.\n\nSo make of that what you will, Jelena truthers.", "description": "The pop star's comeback single, \u201cLose You to Love Me,\u201d brought Hailey Bieber into Jelena drama.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db09dd72100009628ad3b50.png?cache=vk3sp1ccbe&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
