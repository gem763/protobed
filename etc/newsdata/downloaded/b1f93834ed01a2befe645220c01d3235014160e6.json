CEO Tim Cook repeatedly has declared the company\u2019s belief that \u201cprivacy is a fundamental human right,\u201d a phrase that cropped up again in Apple\u2019s apology.\n\nNow, Apple is giving consumers notice when installing the update, iOS 13.2. Individuals can choose \u201cNot Now\u201d to decline audio storage and review. Users who enable this can turn it off later in the settings.\n\nTech companies say the practice helps them to improve their artificial intelligence services.\n\nBut the use of humans to listen to audio recordings is particularly troubling to privacy experts because it increases the chances that a rogue employee or contractor could leak details of what is being said, including parts of sensitive conversations.\n\nApple previously disclosed plans to resume human reviews this fall, but hadn\u2019t specified when. Apple also said then that it would stop using contractors for the reviews.\n\nOther tech companies have also been resuming the practice after giving more notice. Google restarted the practice in September, after taking similar steps to make sure people know what they are agreeing to. Also in September Amazon said users of its Alexa digital assistant could request that recordings of their voice commands delete automatically.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Apple is resuming the use of humans to review Siri commands and dictation with the latest iPhone software update.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mae Anderson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/29/apple_siri_privacy_22522_c0-0-5472-3192_s1200x700.jpg?d097d528e72a2dc2eda9b136f682acf3fccf94da", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
