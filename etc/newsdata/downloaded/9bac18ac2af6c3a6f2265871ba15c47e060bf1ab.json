A simple animation by a former NASA scientist shows what that looks like.", "language": "en", "text": "caption An artist\u2019s concept of a newly formed planetary system. source NASA\n\nYou can\u2019t feel it, but we\u2019re rocketing through space at 1.3 million mph.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Earth is orbiting the sun, which is orbiting the center of the galaxy, which is barreling through the cosmic wind of radiation released during the Big Bang.\n\nA simple animation created by the planetary scientist James O\u2019Donoghue puts the whole thing in perspective.\n\n\u201cPeople often talk about how we are standing on a ball (Earth) which rotates at great speed, and that this ball orbits another at an even greater speed. Sometimes this is extended to how fast we orbit the center of our Milky Way,\u201d O\u2019Donoghue, who used to work at NASA and is now employed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn all the confusion of big numbers and directions, I simply wanted to put all this information into context in a single frame so people could understand where they\u2019re headed \u2013 and how fast.\u201d\n\nOn the left side of the animation, numbers indicate the speeds of Earth\u2019s rotation, its orbit around the sun, the solar system\u2019s orbit around the Milky Way\u2019s center, and the galaxy hurtling through space. The dots moving across the right side of the animation show how quickly each object travels 150 kilometers.\n\nAs you can see, Earth\u2019s rotation is relatively slow, whereas the Milky Way is barreling through space, traveling 600 kilometers (373 miles) every second.\n\nNormally, O\u2019Donoghue said, people portray the Milky Way\u2019s speed by how quickly it\u2019s approaching the nearby Andromeda galaxy. But that isn\u2019t necessarily the best point of comparison.\n\n\u201cThere are so many galaxies moving at different velocities relative to our own, so I figured I\u2019d skip that step and go straight to the biggest apparently moving thing I could think of \u2013 the CMB,\u201d O\u2019Donoghue said, referring to the cosmic microwave background. That\u2019s the faint radiation left over from the Big Bang that fills all of space.\n\n\u201cMeasurements of it indicate it is coming from a particular direction, kind of like a wind,\u201d O\u2019Donoghue added.\n\ncaption The oldest light in the universe, called the cosmic microwave background, as observed by the Planck space telescope. source Planck Collaboration/ESA\n\nBut since all of this is moving, speed is relative.\n\nSo although Earth orbits the sun at 66,600 mph, and the sun orbits the Milky Way at 514,500 mph, our solar system\u2019s speed relative to the CMB is about 827,000 mph. Zoom out further, and our entire galaxy is zipping through the CMB at about 1.3 million mph.\n\nOf course, in your everyday life on Earth, you don\u2019t notice that we\u2019re moving so quickly.\n\nAs Elon Musk said on Twitter, this video \u201cmakes it clear that you can only sense acceleration, not velocity.\u201d\n\nThat is, you can sense only changes in speed. When you\u2019re in a car, even though you might be driving at 80 mph, you don\u2019t feel that motion. You can watch the world whoosh past the car window, of course, just as astronomers observe the Earth\u2019s movements by looking to the sky. But you notice the speed only when someone hits the brakes or the gas.\n\nThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t sense the Earth\u2019s rotation, or the movement of the solar system as it rockets around the Milky Way\u2019s center. Those things are constant. As the animation shows, they\u2019re relative too.", "description": "Business Insider - Earth orbits the sun, which orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy, which is itself barreling through space..
