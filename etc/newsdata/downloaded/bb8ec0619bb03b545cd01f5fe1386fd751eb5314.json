But, as with so much else, President Trump has squandered that durable advantage.\n\nIn Ohio on Tuesday, Democrats sounded very much like Republicans of yore in denouncing Trump for jeopardizing national security.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\n\u201cWhen I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the flag on my shoulder represented a country that kept its word,\u201d said South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a veteran. \u201cYou take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next. This president has betrayed American values.\u201d\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden shouted: \u201cThis is shameful! Shameful what this man has done!\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) said Trump \u201cis basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail free card.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker (N.J.) declared that \u201cRussia and Putin understand strength, and this president time and time again is showing moral weakness.\u201d\n\nEven. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), no hawk, said that \u201cwhen you begin to betray people\u201d as Trump had done to Kurdish allies, \u201ctell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president?\u201d\n\nA dozen years ago, President George W. Bush memorably attacked Democrats who wanted to pull out of Iraq: \u201cThe party of FDR, the party of Harry Truman, has become the party of cut and run.\u201d\n\nNow, a Republican president has recklessly pulled U.S. troops out of northern Syria, to calamitous effect, and it can truly be said: The party of Ronald Reagan has become the party of cut and run.\n\nTrump\u2019s Syria debacle has, above all, been a tragedy \u2014 for our faithful Kurdish allies, for NATO, for the pride of the U.S. military, for national security and for American leadership. But, combined with Trump placing his political self-dealing above U.S. security concerns in Ukraine, the blunder has left an enormous opening for Democrats to establish themselves as the champions of national security.\n\nPolling shows that Trump, and Republicans, have lost some of their traditional advantage on matters of security. A Gallup poll released a couple of weeks ago showed the GOP with a six-percentage-point advantage on protecting the country from terrorism and military threats, compared with a 23-point advantage in 2014, before Trump took over the party.\n\nLast week, an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that a plurality believe Trump has worsened the nation\u2019s security. And the poll was conducted mostly before Trump gave a green light to Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria \u2014 exposing a loyal ally to a massacre, dividing NATO, expanding Russian and Iranian influence, reviving the Islamic State\u2019s prospects, strengthening Syria\u2019s criminal regime and forcing a humiliating retreat by U.S. forces. It had all the dignity of the evacuation of Saigon.\n\nEven those who favored a pullout were stunned by Trump\u2019s clumsiness. But then, this is a man who skipped Vietnam because of bone spurs, raided the Pentagon\u2019s funds for his pet project, relentlessly and posthumously attacked Sen. John McCain, used U.S. troops as political props, hijacked patriotic holidays, skipped memorial events for veterans and sided with the Kremlin over his own advisers.\n\nAnd what did Trump do Monday as the outcry built over his Syrian blunder? He tweeted out a plea to \u201cVote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars.\u201d What patriotic sentiments from a man who, after his Kiev Hustle ended badly and his Turkish Tango forced U.S. troops into a Kurdish Quickstep, is Dancing with the Strongmen, performing the Assad Samba, the Khamenei Can Can and the Putin Polka.\n\nDemocrats couldn\u2019t agree on much at Tuesday night\u2019s debate, which because of its format (a ludicrous 12 candidates onstage) was disjointed and desultory. If it established anything, it\u2019s that the titular front-runner, Biden, is a spent force: He seemed halting and a beat behind (\u201csecondly, I mean thirdly . . .\u201d). Though the polls don\u2019t yet reflect it, the candidates treated Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) as the front-runner, directing most of their challenges at her.\n\nBut for 25 minutes during the second of three tedious hours, Democrats asserted themselves as the defenders of the American military and American security. Though a couple of them (Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Tom Steyer) went their own ways, the others claimed the moral high ground once ceded to Republicans.\n\n\u201cSoldiers in the field,\u201d the veteran Buttigieg said, \u201care reporting that for the first time they feel ashamed \u2014 ashamed of what their country has done. We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with a lifeless body of her child in her arms asking what the hell happened to American leadership.\u201d\n\nWhat happened? Trump happened.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Tuesday\u2019s debate vividly demonstrated just how fluid the Democratic race really is\n\nFact-checking the fourth Democratic debate\n\nHighlights from the fourth Democratic debate\n\nKaren Tumulty: What Biden can learn from John Kerry\u2019s mistakes\n\nMegan McArdle: It\u2019s Democratic voters, not candidates, who might want to reassess", "description": "In Tuesday\u2019s debate, they sounded very much like Republicans of yore in denouncing Trump for jeopardizing national security.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIPVXY.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1236&y=1342", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
