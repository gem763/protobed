The last-minute replacement of the official responsible for screening Wong\u2019s candidacy also fueled concerns about the integrity of the process.\n\n\u201cI strongly condemn the government\u2019s implementation of political examination and selection, depriving me of my right to stand for election,\u201d Wong said in a statement Tuesday. He said that the election official was playing the role of the \u201cthought police.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government is not democratically elected \u2014 a key demand of the protest movement \u2014 but the city holds a quasi-democratic process to choose councilors in 18 local districts who advise the government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPublic fears over deteriorating political rights in Hong Kong are expected to result in a backlash against pro-Beijing candidates in next month\u2019s vote. A poll from the Chinese University of Hong Kong published by the Ming Pao newspaper on Thursday found 44.5 percent of people identified as pro-democracy, up from 27.9 percent in March. Only 6 percent of respondents supported the pro-Beijing camp.\n\nWong isn\u2019t a central figure in the current unrest, which is largely leaderless. But he remains the most internationally recognized of the city\u2019s democracy activists, having shot to fame as a leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement calling for universal suffrage. He was jailed three times for his role in the protests, and was most recently released in June, before being arrested again in August.\n\nSpeaking Friday while his candidacy was still in limbo, Wong said his situation was without precedent. The hasty replacement of the election official, he added, indicated that \u201cinterference from Beijing\u201d had blocked his candidacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI become the only candidate banned from running in November\u2019s District Council Election as Returning officer, Laura ARON ruled my nomination invalid this morning. It proved how Beijing manipulate the election with political cersorship and screening. pic.twitter.com/mwZNKUApFM \u2014 Joshua Wong \u9ec3\u4e4b\u92d2 \ud83d\ude37 (@joshuawongcf) October 29, 2019\n\nChina has characterized Wong as a separatist, and President Xi Jinping has said any effort to challenge Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong is a red line for the ruling Communist Party.\n\nAgnes Chow, another democracy activist and a member of Wong\u2019s party, was disqualified from running in elections in 2018 for her affiliation to Demosisto. A Hong Kong court overturned that decision in September, ruling that there was a breach of procedural fairness.\n\nWhile barring Wong from next month\u2019s contest, authorities permitted other pro-democracy figures to run, including some with more-radical views and others who have been disqualified from previous elections.\n\nAD\n\nStill, Wong\u2019s exclusion marks a snub for one of the Hong Kong\u2019s best-known faces of protest. The 23-year-old has fashioned himself into an unofficial ambassador for the movement, and has traveled to countries such as the United States and Germany to rally foreign support.\n\nAD\n\nHe has advocated passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bipartisan bill before Congress that could impose sanctions or asset freezes on individuals judged to be restricting basic freedoms in the city. The legislation would mandate a review of the special status that the United States affords Hong Kong, under which the territory is treated as separate from mainland China.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously in the House, and is being discussed in the Senate. It would need President Trump\u2019s sign-off to become law.\n\nAD\n\nThe Chinese government has described the bill as interference in China\u2019s internal affairs and vowed to retaliate if it becomes law.", "description": "The former student protest leader, who had sought to contest a district council seat, alleged interference from Beijing after he was disqualified from contesting the Nov. 24 vote.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NaSeIr6HDvaHQ9MJWC1KUzMQ7PU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IQXZOYX2AII6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
