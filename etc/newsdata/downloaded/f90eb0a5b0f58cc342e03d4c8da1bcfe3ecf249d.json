Now Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican and former White House hopeful, has been making waves in his own party instead. He is openly critical of President Trump in personal statements, in a damning op-ed for The Washington Post before he even took office, and Twitter of course \u2014 prompting some analysts to wonder whether Mr. Romney was again striking a presidential posture.\n\nWell, that\u2019s a thought. Mr. Romney has maintained an active campaign website ever since he lost the 2012 presidential election to President Obama. His campaign did develop a site in the event of Mr. Romney\u2019s victory that year. \u201cSmaller, simpler, smarter. Believe in America,\u201d the official motto read at the \u201cOffice of the President-Elect.\u201d The site was deactivated.\n\nSo. Is Mr. Romney ready to try a presidential run? Some question the possibility.\n\n\u201cAccording to people close to Romney, he\u2019s firmly decided against primarying Trump, an enterprise he believes to be a sure loser given Trump\u2019s enduring GOP support. Romney has also told people that, as an unsuccessful two-time presidential candidate, he\u2019s the wrong person to take on Trump,\u201d writes Vanity Fair correspondent Gabriel Sherman. \u201cInstead, a Romney adviser told me that Romney believes he has more potential power as a senator who will decide Trump\u2019s fate in an impeachment trial.\u201d\n\nThere are some noble frills.\n\n\u201cHe could have tremendous influence in the impeachment process as the lone voice of conscience in the Republican caucus,\u201d the adviser told Mr. Sherman.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Romney has been busy behind the scenes, privately reaching out to key players in what Mr. Sherman deems the \u201cRepublican resistance.\u201d Those key players certainly involve his GOP peers.\n\n\u201cRomney is the one guy who could bring along Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Ben Sasse. Romney is the pressure point in the impeachment process. That\u2019s why the things he\u2019s saying are freaking Republicans out,\u201d a source who has been briefed on this matter told Mr. Sherman.\n\nINDEPENDENTS WARM UP TO TRUMP\n\n\u201cA new IBD-TIPP poll shows President Trump has gained significant ground with independent voters in head-to-head matchups with the Democrat Party front-runners for president,\u201d writes Matt Margolis, a contributor to PJ Media.\n\nHe cites a few of the factors. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, for instance, leads Trump by just on percentage point among independents, down from Mr. Biden\u2019s 18-point lead in September. Against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 49% of independents backed Mr. Trump, 43% favored the Massachusetts Democrat. Against Sen. Bernard Sanders, Mr. Trump drew 48% support from independents, Mr. Sanders 44%, down from a previous 9-point lead.\n\n\u201cWhat caused such a dramatic swing in Trump\u2019s favor with independents? Is it a coincidence that this poll was conducted after Nancy Pelosi formally launched an impeachment inquiry into President Trump? Not to me,\u201d comments Mr. Margolis. \u201cImpeachment is not exactly popular amongst voters, and only a minority of independents support it. Many on the right have warned Democrats that impeachment fever will only benefit Trump in the long run \u2014 and they appear to be proven right by this poll.\u201d\n\nMATT SCHLAPP: FOUR MORE YEARS IMMINENT\n\nA longtime conservative leader agrees with many analysts that the Democrats are more or less in a panic over the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats did connect with voters on health care and other issues which Republicans fell back on. They had their opportunity to show the American people what there agenda was. And do you know what their agenda is now? It is to do nothing to but conduct a fishing expedition to find any scandal they can on Donald Trump,\u201d American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp tells Fox News.\n\n\u201cThey are transfixed with this idea that if they don\u2019t bring President Trump down with fake and phony scandals, that they won\u2019t win. They know if they don\u2019t win, Donald Trump will transform this country. Why? Because we then will have eight years of Trump being \u2018Wreck-It Ralph\u2019 to the deep state and the swamp \u2014 and also to the way we have done things in the past 30 years, which has ossified, and caused so much pain to the people around this nation. We need this change. And we need four more years of it,\u201d Mr. Schlapp told the network.\n\nMEANWHILE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nFormer Trump-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who is considering a Senate run in New Hampshire, led a sizable group of the state\u2019s Republicans to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s office in the Manchester on Tuesday for a \u201cStop the Madness\u201d rally \u2014 one of many being organized around the nation to call attention to the foibles of impeachment and other matters.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s campaign launched the volunteer outreach effort Friday, and it has quickly picked up speed with the locals. Mr. Lewandowski and the rallygoers had a message for the Granite State Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe crowd, which featured camo-wearing veterans, a smattering of state legislators and a strong contingent from Vietnamese-Americans for Trump, was there to show support for President Trump, but they seemed happy to hear from his former campaign manager,\u201d reports the New Hampshire Reporter.\n\nMr. Lewandowski used his time to vouch for the president, and tweak the Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey want to bring an impeachment against this president for doing nothing but putting America first. If that\u2019s a crime, guilty as charged,\u201d he told the enthusiastic group.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 72% of U.S. voters are \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d they will vote on the 2020 primary election in their state; 76% of voters who favor President Trump and 73% of those who do not favor Mr. Trump agree.\n\n\u2022 13% say it is \u201cvery likely\u201d they will vote; 13% of pro-Trump voters and 13% of non-Trump voters also agree.\n\n\u2022 10% say the chances are 50-50 they will vote; 8% of pro-Trump voters and 9% of non-Trump voters also agree.\n\n\u2022 3% say it is \u201cnot too likely\u201d they will vote; 1% of pro-Trump voters and 3% of non-Trump voters also agree.\n\n\u2022 3% say it is \u201cnot likely at all\u201d they will vote; 2% of pro-Trump voters and 3% of non-Trump voters also agree.\n\nSource: A Politico/Morning Consult poll of 2,488 registered U.S. voters conducted Sept. 27-30.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
