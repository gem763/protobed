Not any longer\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "The Booker-shortlisted novelist is in self-imposed exile from Turkey, where she fears arrest. But here in Britain, she likes food that brings back memories of Istanbul\n\nElif Shafak\u2019s most recent novel, 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World is built around the dying thoughts of Leila, a sex worker, in the time after her heart has stopped beating but her sensory memory remains. Each chapter begins with a taste \u2013 sugar, lemon, cardamom coffee, watermelon, spiced goat stew \u2013 that takes Leila back to a formative moment in her life, and begins to explain the brutal way in which it is ending. Taken together these memories conjure a city, Istanbul, in all of its contrasting flavours.\n\nThe novel \u2013 included on the shortlist for this year\u2019s Booker prize \u2013 displays all of its author\u2019s lyrical gifts for storytelling, but you guess that the memory device was also born out of an urgent personal necessity: for the past three years Shafak has been unable to return to the country in which she grew up for fear of arrest and prosecution.\n\nShe feels the absence keenly. We meet for lunch in Covent Garden, outdoors at the Petersham Nurseries\u2019 West End home La Goccia, and she confesses as she sits down that she is drawn to spaces like this, which remind her of her other home city. \u201cI seek out courtyards,\u201d she says. \u201cPreferably some water, some greenery, sun. I love eating in courtyards, and there are not that many here.\u201d\n\nShafak, 47, is an open and spirited presence. Though she writes with apparently equal fluency in English and Turkish she says she still feels \u201cher mind runs slightly ahead of her tongue\u201d in her second language, which makes her a very careful listener. She moved to London 10 years ago with her husband and two children after another novel, The Bastard of Istanbul, led to a trial for \u201cinsulting Turkishness\u201d (she was eventually acquitted). Her latest novel has been seized along with two earlier books and is being examined by the Turkish authorities for \u201ccrimes of obscenity\u201d.\n\n\u201cBecause I write about sexual harassment, violence against women, the police have taken my books to the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d she says. \u201cThey take one sentence, something a character has said, and attribute that to the writer. When you are a woman, the attacks are much more severe. And there is a call from these bots and trolls online to put you in prison. From that the Ministry of Justice claims there is a public demand to investigate \u2026\u201d\n\nDo the attempts to silence her \u2013 she was also recently subjected to months of online hate from conservative Islamic groups for having come out as bisexual \u2013 have an effect on her?\n\n\u201cI learned to pay attention to the readers and not to the madness,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause to be a writer in Turkey is a bit like being kissed on one cheek and slapped on the other.\u201d\n\nIf things are bad for novelists, she says, they are worse for journalists. Her husband, Ey\u00fcp Can, an ex-newspaper editor, is also on President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s wanted list. \u201cThere is a thin line between fact and fiction for us,\u201d she says, \u201cand if you are a novelist from my country, or Nigeria, Brazil, Hungary \u2013 the list is getting longer \u2013 you don\u2019t have the luxury of saying: \u2018I am not going to write about what is happening.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe tries to fight those political battles with weapons of nuance and imagination and language. The antidote to authoritarian nationalist politics and religious intolerance, she insists, is not more tribal politics \u2013 it is art and writing and music and food, the activities that bring people together, the creativity that mixes cultures. (In that spirit, in the sunshine, in the courtyard, we have ordered a number of plates to share, lemon sole, pork and summer beans, hake and anchovies, fritters made of courgette flowers, a dish that brings back for her more memories of Istanbul.)\n\nShafak doesn\u2019t cook well, she insists, but she loves food, eating it, reading and writing about it. \u201cPeople say in my novels there is too much food \u2026\u201d she says, but it is there for a reason \u2013 as the best argument against narrow nationalism that we all enjoy every day.\n\nShafak has given two Ted talks \u2013 each watched several million times online \u2013 which, like her books, make a powerful argument for plurality, multiplicity, a refusal to be closely defined. The talks were rooted in her own experience of shifting identity. She was born in France in Strasbourg, where her father was studying for a PhD in philosophy. \u201cThe first house that I remember,\u201d she says, \u201cwas full of leftist students, immigrants reading Althusser, Jean Paul Sartre, smoking Gauloises.\u201d\n\nIn a conservative environment, celebrating pleasure is a radical act\n\nBut then when her parents\u2019 marriage ended her mother brought her back home to a very conservative family in Ankara. \u201cMy mother had dropped out of university thinking love would be enough,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd suddenly she was a divorcee and a single mother.\u201d Usually at that time in Turkey women in that situation would be married off to someone older. It was Shafak\u2019s grandmother who intervened to insist her mother finish her studies; eventually she became a diplomat, which led to more travels.\n\nFrom her grandmother, Shafak also learned many of the folk tales and oral history that she has woven into her fiction. \u201cMany of those stories were a way of talking about women\u2019s sexuality, celebrating pleasure, delight, wine. And of course in a conservative environment celebrating pleasure is a radical act.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest They ate\n\nElif and Tim shared Courgette fritti \u00a37; wood-roasted hake with kalamata olive, caper and anchovy butter \u00a312; lemon sole, salsa verde, Haye Farm tomatoes \u00a314; cabbage slaw with dijon vinaigrette and gooseberry compote \u00a37; Haye Farm pork, summer beans, anchovy and caper dressing \u00a311\n\nThey drank\n\nElif and Tim shared Carafe of Pinot Grigio Grave, Vistorta \u00a328; flat white \u00a33.75. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer\n\nHaving watched at close quarters the ways in which attacks on intellectual freedoms have gone hand in hand with attacks on women and LGBT people in Turkey, she fears those sentiments are spreading, even here. \u201cWhen I first came to this country I thought British people were very calm when it came to politics. I admired that. I no longer think that is true,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThese men\u201d \u2013 Erdogan and Trump, obviously, but perhaps even the man the Istanbul papers call \u201cBoris the Turk\u201d for his Ottoman heritage \u2013 \u201csee politics as a zero sum game,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more ruthless you are with minorities, people think that\u2019s strength. But of course it is a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nShe believes that tendency must be understood before it can be overcome. Shafak lived for several years in the US, where she was a professor, first in Boston and later in Arizona. \u201cI used to listen to lots of rightwing radio stations,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd trying to understand that voice became a habit over the years.\u201d Her YouTube algorithm still believes she is a young American male white supremacist. \u201cI remember Rush Limbaugh saying all the time back then there are \u2018four pillars of deceit\u2019 controlled by the liberals: academia, media, government, science. He used to say we have to create our alternatives to them, and this is what you see these men now doing.\u201d\n\nShafak is often, rightly, described as courageous for her writing \u2013 is that how it feels to her?\n\n\u201cNo, I am a very anxious person,\u201d she says, \u201cfull of panic. But when I am writing a novel I feel more free.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI have met lots of women who have grown up in Turkey who cannot bring themselves to swear in Turkish. But in English they use the F-word all the time. Writing is like that for me.\u201d\n\nI wonder how frustrated she gets, as someone whose life has embraced ambiguity and possibility to hear herself marginalised as a \u201cTurkish writer\u201d, an exotic interloper into the western canon.\n\n\u201cSometimes when I look at the ways novels are being judged, we are very used to measuring them against the European classics,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there are other ways of storytelling, from China, the Middle East. There is not one way of writing a novel. It is a bit like food, there are other cuisines, other traditions, no less rich and no less real.\u201d\n\nBy this time we have been eating for a couple of hours. I note the contrast between the delights of the dishes we have shared and the depressing implications of the conversation, not least in the months ahead.\n\nShe laughs. \u201cThe grimmer things are, the more demoralised you are feeling, the more important it is to make sure you at least sit and have a lovely lunch.\u201d\n\n10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World (Viking, \u00a314.99) is out now.
