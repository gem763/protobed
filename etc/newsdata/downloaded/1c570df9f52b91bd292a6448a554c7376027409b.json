Its move sets it apart from Facebook, which continues to defend running paid political ads, even false ones, as a free speech priority.\n\n\u201cWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions,\u201d Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Wednesday in a series of tweets announcing the new policy.\n\nFacebook has taken fire since it disclosed earlier in October that it will not fact-check ads by politicians or their campaigns, which could allow them to lie freely. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress last week that politicians have the right to free speech on Facebook.\n\nIn Facebook\u2019s earnings conference call \u2014 which began less than an hour after Dorsey\u2019s tweet \u2014 Zuckerberg issued an impassioned monologue about what he called Facebook\u2019s deep belief \u201cthat political speech is important\u201d and stood by the company\u2019s decision to run unchecked political ads. He denied this choice is financially motivated, saying such ads make up less than half of a percent of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nTo put that in perspective, he added, Facebook\u2019s recent $5 billion Federal Trade Commission fine was more than 10 times that.\n\n\u201cThis is complex stuff. Anyone who says the answer is simple hasn\u2019t thought about the nuances and downstream challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can say that we are not doing what we believe or we haven\u2019t thought hard about these issues.\u201d\n\nGoogle did not have an immediate comment on Twitter\u2019s policy change.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign manager called Twitter\u2019s change a \u201cvery dumb decision\u201d in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said.\n\nThe presidential campaign for former Vice President Joe Biden said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that companies would think the only option was to completely ban political ads.\n\n\u201cWhen faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out,\u201d Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for Biden\u2019s campaign said in a statement.\n\nPolitical advertising makes up a small sliver of Twitter\u2019s overall revenue. The company does not break out specific figures each quarter, but said political ad spending for the 2018 midterm election was less than $3 million.\n\nCandidates spend significantly more purchasing ads on Facebook than on Twitter, company records show.\n\nThe issue suddenly arose in September when Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, refused to remove a misleading video ad from President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign that targeted Biden.\n\nIn response, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another presidential hopeful, ran her own ad on Facebook taking aim at Zuckerberg. The ad falsely claimed that Zuckerberg endorsed President Donald Trump for re-election, acknowledging the deliberate falsehood as necessary to make a point.\n\nCritics have called on Facebook to ban all political ads. These include CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who recently called the company\u2019s policy of allowing lies \u201cabsolutely ludicrous\u201d and advised the social media giant to sit out the 2020 election until it can figure out something better.\n\nMisleading political ads on social media burst into the spotlight during the 2016 presidential election, when Russian agents took out thousands of ads on Facebook in an attempt to sow political division and influence the election.\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock, another Democratic 2020 contender, retweeted Dorsey\u2019s announcement, adding the comment, \u201cGood. Your turn, Facebook.\u201d\n\nDorsey said the company is recognizing that advertising on social media offers an unfair level of targeting compared to other mediums. It is not about free expression, he asserted.\n\n\u201cThis is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address.\u201d\n\nTwitter currently only allows certified campaigns and organizations to run political ads for candidates and issues. The latter tend to advocate on broader issues such as climate change, abortion rights and immigration.\n\nThe company said it will make some exceptions, such as allowing ads that encourage voter turnout. It will describe those in a detailed policy it plans to release on Nov. 15.\n\nIt will also still allow politicians to freely tweet their thoughts and opinions, which can then be shared and spread. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed in particular is known for his often bombastic and controversial tweets that are shared widely.\n\nTwitter said in June that political figures and world leaders who tweet abusive or threatening messages might get slapped with a warning label, but the tweets would remain on the site. Twitter has not yet used this warning label.\n\nFederal campaigns are expected to spend the majority of advertising dollars on broadcast and cable channels during the 2020 election, according to advertising research firm Kantar, and about 20% of the total $6 billion in spending on digital ads.\n\nTwitter\u2019s policy will start on Nov. 22.\n\n___\n\nAP reporters Amanda Seitz in Chicago, Will Weissert in Washington, and Tali Arbel and Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this article.", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Twitter, reacting to growing concern about misinformation spread on social media, is banning all political advertising from its", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/30/3895e2_twitter-political-ads-ban-35467-in-sept-2018-file-photo-twitter-ceo-jack-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
