The shark is believed to have then attacked the other man, biting off his foot.\n\nThe tourists had been \"wrestling and thrashing about in the water in Hook Passage when the attack occurred,\" according to the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland , which coordinated the helicopter rescue.\n\nThere were two other passengers on board who were paramedics and provided immediate first aid, said Tourism Whitsundays.\n\nAn English tourist has had his foot bitten off by a shark while on a tourist vessel in Hook Passage - 11km from Cid Habour. #SharkAttack pic.twitter.com/bNn0wydgPi \u2014 RACQ (@RACQOfficial) October 29, 2019\n\nThe two men were airlifted to Mackay Hospital by helicopter, with one patient stable and the second \"serious,\" according to the Queensland Ambulance Service\n\nZigZag Whitsundays, the tour group operator, said in a statement it was \"saddened\" by the incident. \"Our thoughts are with them, their families and the other guests on the tour,\" the statement said.\n\nThe statement added that the group had suspended its remaining tours for the day and \"will work closely with authorities regarding our upcoming tours.\"\n\nThe Whitsunday Islands have a history of shark attacks -- a man died there last November, after he jumped into the water from his paddle board. Just months earlier, in September, two people were attacked by sharks in separate incidents in the same harbor within 24 hours, suffering injuries to their legs.\n\nAfter the three attacks, state authorities caught and killed six sharks in the area. Steve O'Connell, a local inspector, told CNN last year that the three major attacks were an anomaly for the Whitsundays.", "description": "Two British tourists were injured in a shark attack in northeastern Australia on Tuesday morning, with one losing his foot.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180702120052-worlds-best-sailing-destinations-whitsundays-stonehaven-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
