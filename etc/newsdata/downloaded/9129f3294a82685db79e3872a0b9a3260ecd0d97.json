The UN and other human rights organisations have already established the link between the Grand Prix and the human rights abuses suffered by Najah \u2013 F1 can no longer simply wait and watch from the stands.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by The Independent, Formula One insisted it has always been clear with \u201call race promoters and governments with which we deal worldwide\u201d, including Bahrain, that \u201cwe take violence, abuse of human rights and repression very seriously\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We have done this within the constraints of being a private business, without the powers of investigation (in terms of authority, resource and official channels) to fully uncover all the facts.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether races would no longer be held there, the organisation refused to comment.\n\nMs Yusuf, who is among only a handful of political prisoners to be pardoned since 2011, called for Formula One to recognise the alleged abuses she has been subjected to, as well as asking Lewis Hamilton to call for an investigation into her case.\n\n\u201cFormula One must recognise the abuses I was subjected to,\u201d she told The Independent in her first interview since being released from prison. \u201cIn calling for a boycott of Formula One, I was voicing my right of freedom of expression, but I was imprisoned. Formula One should take responsibility for what happened to me. A call from Lewis Hamilton is also important. What I personally experienced should not happen to anyone. There must be accountability for those who abused me.\u201d\n\nThe 42-year-old, who was sacked from her job as a civil servant over the saga, added: \u201cThe police beat me and threatened me with rape. They also threatened to kill me and told me they would kill my children. They said they would fabricate an accident which happened to the children but kill them \u2013 saying \u2018everything will look normal. We can do this to you.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhile being interrogated in police custody, I was also raped. My dignity was destroyed.\u201d\n\nBahrain has close ties with the UK and the British government has consistently refused to condemn wider allegations of human rights violations in the country.\n\nSayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird), said: \u201cThe UN ruling has confirmed manifold violations against Najah Yusuf, from the breach of her right to freely criticise, to her unlawful torture, sexual assault and unfair trial. This incontrovertible evidence has rightly triggered another U-turn from F1, as it is impossible for them to continue accepting false assurances from Bahrain and sportswashing the country\u2019s abuses.\n\n\u201cNow it is time for F1 to publicly use its full leverage to ensure Najah receives appropriate redress, including the restoration of her job and accountability on the part of those who violated her rights. If this is not achieved in a timely manner, F1 will be empowering the Bahraini regime to continue abusing their citizens for their legitimate criticism of the race.\n\n\u201cWhile Formula One has rightly raised the recent UN ruling with the Bahraini government, they need to make it clear that a failure to act on the ruling\u2019s recommendations will have consequences to their tangible business relationship. A failure to do so will only assure Bahrain that F1 will continue to sportswash their abuses and encourage the increasingly arrogant regime in their brazen attacks on freedom of expression.\u201c\n\nMr Alwadaei, whose own family are in jail in Bahrain allegedly over his human rights work, said there is \u201cno indication\u201d the Bahraini authorities plan to hold Ms Yusuf\u2019s abusers to account.\n\nThe original court judgment against Ms Yusuf, who was sentenced to three years in jail in June 2018 but was held in custody for almost a year before then, said she had written \u201cno to Formula One races on occupied Bahraini land\u201d and said Formula One presence in the wealthy country was \u201cnothing more than a way for the [ruling] al-Khalifa family to whitewash their criminal record and gross human rights violations\u201d.\n\nBahrain, which is one of the UK\u2019s longest-standing allies in the Gulf, is \u201cone of the Middle East\u2019s most repressive states\u201d, according to the US NGO Freedom House.\n\nThe UK has licensed \u00a3105m worth of arms to Bahrain since the pro-democracy Arab Spring uprising in February 2011.\n\nThe Bahraini authorities refused to comment on Formula One\u2019s letter to them.\n\nBut a spokesperson for the Bahraini embassy said Ms Yusuf\u2019s claims of mistreatment were fully investigated by the kingdom of Bahrain\u2019s independent ombudsman and no evidence was found to support the claims. They said she was convicted of terror offences.\n\n\u201cThe conviction of Najah Yusuf has no connection whatsoever to the Formula One race, nor to any other freedom of expression issues,\u201d the spokesperson added.", "description": "Formula One has promised to raise the alleged\u00a0rape and torture of a jailed activist with Bahraini authorities after previously failing to acknowledge human rights abuses in the country \u2013 but stopped short of saying this\u00a0would affect the decision to hold lucrative grand prix races there", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/29/10/bahrain-grand-prix-protest1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
