It'll have a 13-inch screen with the options of regular 1080p and sharp 4K resolutions, and it'll run on typical laptop specs like Intel Core processors, 8 to 16 GB of RAM, and 64 to 256 GB of storage.\n\nLike the Pixelbook, the Pixelbook Go will have a premium metal exterior, albeit not quite as sleek and sober. It'll have more rounded corners and edges and will be available in different colors. 9to5Google's video shows a \"Not Pink\" version of the Pixelbook Go with an odd \"ribbed\" texture on the bottom.\n\n9to5Google's Stephen Hall said the Pixelbook Go has the same keyboard as the original Pixelbook, which was surprisingly among the best keyboards I've tried.\n\nUnfortunately, there was no mention of a fingerprint sensor on the Pixelbook Go. It's something I would have loved to see on the original Pixelbook to sign into the device more easily rather than using my Google password.\n\nSo far, 9to5Google predicts a price tag of $800 and up.\n\nCheck out 9to5Google's full rundown of the upcoming Pixelbook Go:", "description": "Google's Pixel 4 has already been leaked to a comical extent, and now a hands-on video of a prototype of the upcoming Pixelbook Go Chromebook is out.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0968ecc4a0a2e806c4b45?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
