USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Los Angeles Lakers traveled for 15 hours and believed they would spend their week this way. They would host a handful of clinics. They would play a pair of preseason games. They would expand their business portfolio. The throngs of Chinese fans would cheer their every move.\n\nInstead, the Lakers\u2019 week played out much differently. They landed in Shanghai a day after Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted out support for the Hong Kong protestors. The Chinese government retaliated by pressuring the NBA to cancel community events. The Chinese\u2019 state-run TV refused to broadcast the games, and various sponsors terminated their deals. The NBA canceled all of its media appearances. While NBA Commissioner Adam Silver apologized to China while defending Morey\u2019s freedom of speech, the Lakers wondered if they would actually play. As Lakers guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope admitted, \u201cWe thought they were going to be canceled.\u201d\n\nMOST DISGRACEFUL MOMENT OF HIS CAREER: LeBron James undermines values he's espoused\n\nTERRIBLE WEEK FOR NBA: May open more eyes to price of doing business in China\n\nLakers guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (1) scores a basket against the Warriors during the second half at Staples Center.

Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSo while the NBA sought to rectify its business relationship with China, the Lakers spent their time with each other.\n\n\u201cThat trip really brought us together as a team,\u201d Lakers center Dwight Howard said. \u201cWe had some really good moments. We will never forget those. Despite everything that happened, we came out really good.\u201d\n\nHoward maintained those top moments \u201cwill stay between us.\u201d Yet, team accounts suggested the Lakers bonded in various ways.\n\nThey had team dinners. They played cards on the team plane and in the hotel. Even when construction workers tore down promotional ads for the Lakers\u2019 preseason game against the Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai, the Lakers practiced as if they would still play. Once they did, the Lakers became increasingly confident they would return to the court for another pre-season game against Brooklyn in Shenzhen, China.\n\n\u201cI want to commend our guys for really blocking everything out and focusing on our process of trying to get better. We had a really productive trip,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cThis is one of the most locked-in groups I ever coached in terms of hanging on every word in film sessions, talking out coverages in practices and walk-throughs and throughout the game. They are really focused on trying to be great. That showed up on this trip.\u201d\n\nGranted, the Lakers still felt frustrated. James argued that Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d on how his tweet could threaten both the players\u2019 safety over there and their business deals. Silver also met with players on the Lakers and Nets to hear their concerns about being caught in the middle of an international incident. Silver offered a specific message.\n\n\u201cJust be us,\u201d Caldwell-Pope said. \u201cStay within yourself and control what we can control.\u201d\n\nIf only those were the challenges that awaited the Lakers. After the trip ended, they flew back to Los Angeles and landed around 5 a.m. PT because of weather delays. After having a day off to recover from jetlag, the Lakers then made their preseason debut against the Warriors at Staples Center.\n\nThe Warriors could sympathize to an extent. After winning two titles in three Finals appearances from 2015-17, the Warriors made a pre-season trip to China in 2017. But they did not play another game until five days after their trip ended.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m just surprised they scheduled this game less than 48 hours after returning,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cIt took us about a few weeks to get us over the jetlag.\u201d\n\nIt might take that time for the Lakers, but they still had to play. Granted, the Lakers rested James, Danny Green, Avery Bradley and Rajon Rondo for that reason. The Lakers also sat Anthony Davis, whose MRI revealed a sprained right thumb and will be listed as day-to-day. And Kyle Kuzma missed his fourth exhibition game after just receiving clearance to complete non-contact drills while healing a stress reaction in his left foot.\n\nNonetheless, the Lakers still finished with a 104-98 win over a Warriors team that also sat Draymond Green and D\u2019Angelo Russell. While Stephen Curry scored 17 points on 6-of-17 shooting in 21 minutes, the Lakers relied on a starting lineup featuring Zach Norvell Jr. (22 points), Howard (12 points, 13 rebounds, six assists), Caldwell-Pope (11 points), Alex Caruso, and Jared Dudley.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is in uniform. We\u2019re trying to play to a standard and play a certain way,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to have an identity that we play harder than our opponent every night and we play more physical than our opponent every night.\u201d", "description": "Here's an inside look at how the Lakers handled their week in China amid an international incident spurred by a tweet from Rockets GM Daryl Morey.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published A.M.
