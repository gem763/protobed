(The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Waterfront Toronto is in the home stretch of negotiations with Sidewalk over the latter\u2019s plan. Sticking points include the amount of land Sidewalk proposes to develop for its IDEA District, which goes well beyond the agreed-to 12 acres, and how the Google sister company would collect and manage data. Toronto Mayor John Tory told The Financial Times that he would \u201cvery much like there to be a deal\u201d and that he was open to Sidewalk developing beyond the original site. Waterfront did not say whether Tory\u2019s remarks reflected the organization\u2019s position.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
