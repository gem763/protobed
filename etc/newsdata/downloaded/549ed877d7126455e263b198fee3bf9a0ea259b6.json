Which is really a shame, because generally speaking, there\u2019s a lot more to a person than his or her political leanings.\n\nNevertheless, here we are. As Twitchy pal @molratty explains, the constant holier-than-thou moralizing and rushes to judgment only serve to make our already messy political climate even more toxic:\n\nA few weeks ago, we were having a really nice dinner with my SIL, whom I adore. She is a pretty radical lefty, but that doesn't matter to me at all. I love her as my own sister. \u2014 Mo Mo (@molratty) October 14, 2019\n\nWe were having fun and laughing throughout dinner. During dessert, she decided to ask me, in the most condescending manner possible, how it could possibly be that my parents (whom she loves) voted for Trump, because they are otherwise so good and kind. \u2014 Mo Mo (@molratty) October 14, 2019\n\nShe \"didn't want to upset\" me, but felt like it was somehow an appropriate question to ask, as if my parents are some sort of freaks for voting for him. \"How can they vote for him when he acts the way he does?\" she asked me. \u2014 Mo Mo (@molratty) October 14, 2019\n\nMy parents, who have spent their whole lives helping other people: the homeless, battered women, the disabled. Giving endless time, their home, their food, their money to people who needed help. She acted like they are immoral for voting for him. \u2014 Mo Mo (@molratty) October 14, 2019\n\nEvery day here, I encounter someone who thinks he is morally superior because he votes the \"right\" way. These people go on and on about how they are the only civil people left while they call Trump supporters \"MAGAts\" and all other manner of names. \u2014 Mo Mo (@molratty) October 14, 2019\n\nThis is a sickness. You are not morally superior because you vote a certain way. If you think you are, you need to seriously evaluate your mental and moral health. \u2014 Mo Mo (@molratty) October 14, 2019\n\nIf you really want to contribute to healthy discourse, stop acting like and thinking people who disagree with you politically are subhuman. Otherwise, you're part of the problem with our discourse and you should probably stop pretending you want good discourse. \u2014 Mo Mo (@molratty) October 14, 2019\n\nWell said.\n\nThe bubble doesn\u2019t help. When all you hear is that Trump voters are fascist hicks, you eventually start believing it. Politics should never define anyone. There are wonderful people who voted on the other side, and assholes that voted with us. The opposite is also true. \u2014 Unagi (@brownrobin64) October 14, 2019\n\nIn this day and age, it\u2019s easy to forget that people are more than their politics. People on both sides are guilty of misjudging, and people on both sides have been misjudged. But the sooner we go back to focusing on a person\u2019s words and actions rather than just who they vote for, the better off we\u2019ll be.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Pm On October", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-supporters-rally.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
