The trolley problem, for example, is a classic philosophical thought experiment in which a runaway train is barreling toward either one of two groups of people, and the conductor has to choose who will die. This thought experiment is real for self-driving car engineers, who must equip a car to make real-time decisions with life-and-death consequences.\n\n\"What if a semi-autonomous car makes a decision on which person to crash into by analyzing LinkedIn and Facebook data to determine an individual's net worth?\" Ramanathan told Business Insider.", "description": "AI, drones, and self-driving vehicles raise many open-ended questions about the unintended consequences of technology.", "authors": ["Dave Johnson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9e9e4dee0194492008148?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
