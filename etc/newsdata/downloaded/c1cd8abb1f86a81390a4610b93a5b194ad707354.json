The decision by a party\u2019s previous nominee to avoid backing a sitting president is yet another norm-breaking episode in Trump\u2019s tumultuous time atop the Republican Party.\n\nRomney is a friend of one of Trump\u2019s primary challengers, Bill Weld, who served as Massachusetts governor before Romney\u2019s term in office. In an interview in April, Romney called Weld a \u201csuperb governor\u201d but declined to say if he would get behind the long-shot candidate.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Index.Html"], "top_image": ""}
