He added that his predecessors \u201cmade a bad decision\u201d when they involved the US \u201cinto the Middle East Wars.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the week, the US-led NATO bloc member, Turkey, launched a massive military operation against the Kurdish forces in northern Syria, who have been Washington\u2019s main allies in fighting the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS).\n\nHe rejected calls for the US to defend the Kurds, saying: \u201cOthers may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them!\u201d As for Washington, it will only be \u201cmonitoring\u201d the situation in northern Syria, he added.\n\n.....The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nTrump has ordered a \u201cdeliberate evacuation\u201d of the remaining 1,000 US troops from northern Syria as they were caught between the advancing Turkish military and the Kurdish forces, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CBS\u2019 Face the Nation program.\n\nThe president\u2019s order was made late on Saturday and urged the pullout to be organized \u201cas safely and quickly as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US has already recovered several dozen of its servicemen, who used to be embedded with the Kurdish-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), thus basically giving Ankara the green light to launch its military operation. The Kurds decried the move by Washington as a betrayal.\n\nAlso on rt.com Turkey will push 35km into Syria and Western arms embargoes won\u2019t make it turn back \u2013 Erdogan\n\nThe US initially tried to talk Turkey out of intervening in northern Syria, with Trump even threatening to \u201cwipe out\u201d the country\u2019s economy. But Ankara, who says it is looking to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d near its border with the Kurdish-held areas, dismissed the US threats.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
