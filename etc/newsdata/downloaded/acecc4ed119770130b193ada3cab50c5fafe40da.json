Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill Friday that will ban all new contracts and contract renewals with for-profit, private prisons starting January 1.\n\nCalifornia is the first state to enact a bill banning prisons of this nature, which also includes civil and immigration detention centers. Under the legislation, all existing contracts with for-profit, private prisons and detention centers will be phased out by 2028.\n\nThe state currently has four contracts with for-profit, private prison companies for criminal detention and has four civil detention centers operated by for-profit, private companies.\n\nAssemblymember Rob Bonta, who authored the bill, said in a press release that this is a \"historic moment for California.\"\n\n\"By ending the use of for-profit, private prisons and detention facilities, we are sending a powerful message that we vehemently oppose the practice of profiteering off the backs of Californians in custody, that we will stand up for the health, safety and welfare of our people, and that we are committed to humane treatment for all,\" he said.\n\nThe prisons and detention facilities impacted by the new law house more than 1,400 inmates and 4,000 detainees, respectively.\n\nCalifornia is banning the use of for-profit, private detention facilities, including those the federal government uses for immigrants awaiting deportation hearings. Governor Gavin Newsom announced Friday, October 11, 2019 he had signed a measure into law that helps fulfill his promise to end the use of private prisons. Chris Carlson / AP\n\nOne of the nation's largest immigrant detention facilities, the Adelanto Detention Facility, will be phased out as part of the new legislation. CBS San Francisco previously reported on the facility's poor conditions.\n\nIn 2018, the Office of the Inspector General found that the conditions at Adelanto were \"egregious.\"\n\n\"The inspection at the Adelanto facility revealed significant health and safety risks, including nooses in detainee cells, improper and overly restrictive segregation, and inadequate detainee medical care,\" a report by the office noted.\n\nThe new legislation is part of an ongoing process within the state to reform prison policies and facilities. The state has seen a decline in its inmate population and is on a path to end some mandatory sentences.", "description": "The state will completely phase out for-profit, private prisons or civil detention centers by 2028", "authors": ["Li Cohen"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/12/5cb61aae-105c-4a0e-bc46-c10246acb7b5/thumbnail/1200x630/3a88b2bf9f4c1f62d438cf3c60b7df9a/gettyimages-450371317.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
