Both Parnas, who was born in Ukraine, and Fruman, who is originally from Belarus, were photographed with Trump, the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr and the vice-president, Mike Pence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The booking photos of Lev Parnas, left, and Igor Fruman, right, provided by the Alexandria sheriff\u2019s office. Photograph: AP\n\nThe two men were also involved in helping Giuliani in an effort to gather compromising material on Trump\u2019s potential challenger for the presidency, Joe Biden. Parnas was with Giuliani when he met the former special envoy on Ukraine Kurt Volker in July, to discuss persuading the incoming Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate the Bidens.\n\nTheir attorney, John Dowd, another former Trump lawyer, said on Monday they would not comply with congressional demands to turn over documents and give depositions to the House committees investigating whether Trump abused his office in the pursuit of damaging information about the Bidens.\n\nDowd previously represented Trump in Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe House committees issued subpoenas to Parnas and Fruman on Thursday for their documents and depositions.\n\nNeither Giuliani nor the effort to discredit Biden are mentioned in the indictment, but it does give details of a political donation to an unnamed congressman in 2018, whose help they sought in seeking to oust the then US ambassador to Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch, who was putting pressure on the Ukrainian government at the time to tackle corruption.\n\nThe description of the congressman matches Pete Sessions, a former Republican representative from Texas, who met Parnas and Fruman in May and wrote a letter on 9 May to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, demanding Yovanovitch\u2019s removal, claiming \u201cconcrete evidence from close companions that Ambassador Yovanovitch has spoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current administration\u201d.\n\nTrump-Ukraine impeachment scandal: timeline of key events Read more\n\n\u201cParnas\u2019s efforts to remove the ambassador were conducted at least in part at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,\u201d the indictment said.\n\nYovanovitch was ousted in May, before she had completed her posting. Parnas and Fruman had predicted her removal and reportedly boasted they were working with Giuliani to bring it about.\n\nThe indictment also alleges Parnas and Fruman, with two other named defendants, sought to use foreign money to buy influence to help an abortive business venture to grow recreational marijuana; the scheme collapsed when they failed to apply for a business license on time.", "description": "Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested on charges including conspiracy, making false statements and falsifying records", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "Rebecca Solnit", "Katie Herzog"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c0101262cc7260dcdf779d6bd363982c8e245e8/0_15_1398_839/master/1398.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d3dfef1e9f71436fb29b8da934270374", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
