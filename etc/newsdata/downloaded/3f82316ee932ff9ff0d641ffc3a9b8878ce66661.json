While defending the company\u2019s decision not to ban outright false political ads, Zuckerberg described politicians\u2019 calls to regulate tech companies as an effort that would restrict freedom of expression.\n\nThe speech immediately drew criticism from Democratic presidential candidates. Senator Elizabeth Warren targeted the CEO on Twitter saying the speech showed \u201chow little he has learned from 2016 and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election.\u201d Over the past year, Warren has been leading the charge to break up big tech companies and she has brought the issue to the political stage. On Monday, Facebook announced steps it\u2019s taking to safeguard the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cI think it is very clear the impact social media has on the conversation, on politics, on so many parts of life,\u201d Alexis Ohanian, Reddit co-founder, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move, noting that he did not watch Zuckerberg\u2019s speech. \u201cI get nervous at the idea of any institution \u2014 any single institution governing what the sort of rules are outside of the more obvious ones. I think it's \u2014 it's obviously important we have laws in place for a good reason. And \u2014 and those are the sort of high level rules for the road.\u201d\n\nOhanian said one of the first things Reddit did in 2014, when he returned to the company, was update its content policy and enforce \u201ctighter rules for the road. And I think these platforms now have such a reach and such a scale that you can't escape that reality. And we also need to be thinking about ways to do it not just for the issues of today, but for the ones of the future,\u201d he said.\n\n(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) More\n\nHe added, \u201cI do think that for all of its imperfections, our model of government, and the fact that it is designed to evolve and has lots of checks and balances, is a good one for thinking about how many of these platforms should think about operating themselves. But I think there's a lot to be desired based on the effort that's been put forth so far.\u201d\n\nMost of the Democrats running for president have called for tougher regulations on the big tech companies. Warren, specifically, laid out a proposal that would lead to the breakup of Google, Amazon, and Facebook.\n\nBut Ohanian argues that lawmakers need to do their part before going up against these companies.\n\n\u201cI would recommend to the folks in Washington, that when they are getting a chance to speak with the leaders of these companies that they're doing their homework,\u201d Ohanian said. \u201cI think one of the most frustrating things for a lot of us in tech is we're seeing sitting members of government asking really fundamental questions like, what is your business model, to someone like Mark Zuckerberg, who really should be asked different questions and not ones that, you know, an intern could have Googled.\u201d\n\nLawmakers will get a chance to grill Zuckerberg once again this week. The CEO is in the hot seat on Wednesday. This time he will be defending Libra, the company\u2019s crypotocurrency project.\n\nValentina Caval is a Producer with Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\n\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian weights in on Washington's Big Tech debate.", "authors": ["Valentina Caval"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TOOJ9ZDS7esjORp22GQ1bg--~B/aD0yOTExO3c9NDI2NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/2e43a520-f4d4-11e9-9a5f-d3b67eefcf2f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
