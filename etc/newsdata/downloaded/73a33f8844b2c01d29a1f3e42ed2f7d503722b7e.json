REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nWhile cliffhanger negotiations for Britain\u2019s Brexit deal should dominate the summit, the crisis in Turkey and Syria and the EU\u2019s next seven-year-budget will also take up much of the leaders\u2019 time. Here is a rundown on the meeting\u2019s main themes.\n\nBREXIT\n\nThis is the last summit scheduled before Britain\u2019s current date of exit from the union of Oct. 31. The European Commission and Britain have been holding last-ditch talks to clinch a deal that leaders can agree on at the meeting.\n\nThe main stumbling block is the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland: how to prevent it becoming a backdoor into the EU\u2019s single market without erecting controls that could undermine the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence.\n\nPossible results include a framework deal for an orderly Oct. 31 Brexit with legal details agreed upon later, an extra EU summit a couple of days before the Oct. 31 deadline, a further Brexit extension, or possibly no deal at all.\n\nEU BUDGET FOR 2021-2027\n\nThe EU budget, called the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), is an enormous undertaking with the union deciding on its finances for the coming six years - 2021-2027. The biggest issue is how the union will cover the shortfall left by Britain\u2019s departure.\n\nMember states have yet to agree how much of individual countries\u2019 economies - gross national incomes (GNI) - should be contributed to the EU. Suggestions range from as much as 1.114% to as little as 1.0% of members\u2019 GNI.\n\nThe leaders will discuss how to make the budget fairer by ending the tradition of rebates, where certain member states have historically received reductions of their contributions to the EU budget.\n\nAlso on the budgetary agenda are reforms, investments and measures to mitigate financial shocks in the 19 countries sharing the single currency.\n\nEU ENLARGEMENT\n\nAlbania and North Macedonia are next in line to join the EU for what would be the bloc\u2019s first enlargement since 2013, when Croatia joined. But not all member states are on board.\n\nAt ministerial talks on Tuesday, France stuck to its hard line against membership talks for the Balkan countries, setting up a showdown between French President Emmanuel Macron and fellow EU leaders at the summit.\n\nFrance says challenges facing the EU - including Brexit; China as a \u201cstrategic rival\u201d; security threats posed by Russia; and migration - are already too extensive to admit two more states from a region still scarred by the legacy of 1990s wars and struggling with crime and corruption.\n\nFrance\u2019s stance has raised concerns in Brussels about further delays in an already protracted process that could backfire by spurring Balkan states to cultivate closer ties with Russia and China.\n\nTURKEY AND SYRIA\n\nOn Monday, EU countries agreed to limit arms exports to Turkey over its offensive in northern Syria, prompting condemnation from Ankara, even as they stopped short of a bloc-wide embargo against a NATO ally.\n\nTurkey was already being scrutinized for its drilling for oil and gas in the east Mediterranean, which has triggered condemnations from several EU states.\n\nEU CLIMATE TARGETS\n\nThe summit will be the scheduled gathering of EU leaders before the United Nation\u2019s climate summit in Chile in December. A few member states have not yet signed up to the EU goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050.\n\nOther member states are also pushing for more ambitious goals for 2030 goals relative to 1990, currently set at a 40% reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. The tensions prevented the bloc from taking a leadership role in fighting climate change during the UN summit in September.\n\nCONFIRMATION OF CHRISTINE LAGARDE AND CHARLES MICHEL\n\nChristine Lagarde is the nominee to be president of the European Central Bank and Charles Michel, currently Belgian prime minister, is slated to be the next head of the European Council, a role that will see him chair EU summits.\n\nLagarde, former director of the International Monetary Fund, is due to become the first woman president of the ECB on Nov. 1. Michel is due to assume office on Dec. 1.", "description": "EU national leaders will meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to discuss some of the biggest issues facing the bloc, including the prospect of a member state leaving for the first time and two countries looking to join.", "authors": ["Jonas Ekblom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441171487&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1IB", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
