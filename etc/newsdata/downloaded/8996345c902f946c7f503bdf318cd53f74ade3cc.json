Google is expected to announce its newest flagship phone October 15 at a hardware event in New York City, alongside a Nest-branded version of its Home Mini smart speaker. That means if you're a user who doesn't need the latest smartphone, this is an excellent time to buy last year's Pixel 3.\n\nBest Buy, likely attempting to clear out its old inventory before the new devices roll in, has announced multiple discounts on Pixel 3 phones. You'll save $350 if you buy the phone unlocked, $300 if you order through Verizon, and $200 if you order through Sprint and activate immediately. You'll also get a free Google Nest Hub smart display that normally costs $129 if you order an unlocked or Verizon model.\n\nWhy buy the Pixel 3? Despite being last year's model, Google's Pixel 3 is still an excellent phone, especially at a sub-$500 price. It supports wireless charging and ships with an excellent pair of USB-C earbuds. You also get a bright OLED screen that looks great and solid battery life that lasted 15-18 hours in our testing.\n\nBut the main reason to get the Pixel 3 is the camera. This phone contains a wide-angle selfie lens in addition to its standard front shooter, so you can now take ultra-wide photos with your friends. The rear camera takes better photos than competing iPhones, with excellent portraits and a night mode for low-light shots.\n\nWe don't know how long this deal will last, so take advantage soon if you're interested. Adding the unlocked or Verizon Pixel 3 to your cart will automatically add a Nest Hub as well.\n\nBuy the Pixel 3 (unlocked, 64GB) from Best Buy for $449.99 (originally $799.99) [You save $350 and get a free Nest Hub]\n\nBuy the Pixel 3 (Verizon, 64GB) from Best Buy for $499.99 (originally $799.99) [You save $300 and get a free Nest Hub]\n\nBuy the Pixel 3 (Verizon, 128GB) from Best Buy for $599.99 (originally $899.99) [You save $300 and get a free Nest Hub]", "description": "Google's Pixel 3 is an excellent, affordable smartphone with a great camera.
