So reformer Pilates is simply pilates done on a reformer.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK great. That clears that up. But there are other terms that you might not be familiar with too \u2013 so, what\u2019s \u2018dynamic reformer Pilates\u2019?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the newest take on Pilates and the one used in one version or another by many boutique fitness providers,\u2019 explains Justin.\n\n\u2018As the name suggests, it\u2019s a more intense and dynamic version of traditional Pilates.\n\nWhat is dynamic reformer Pilates? We increase the dynamic flow of the exercises\n\nWe increase the number of repetitions and level of exertion. By working the muscles to fatigue we grow stronger and adapt faster, and by building strength we can then work harder\n\nWe focus more on neutral spine to reduce the risk of posture-related injury\n\nWe add aspects of weights and circuit training into the sessions to increase the heart rate and challenge the body further\n\nWe make sets longer with less resting time, to add an aerobic component and increase stamina Ten Health and Fitness\n\n\u2018It offers all the postural, flexibility toning and injury-prevention benefits of traditional Pilates, but at Ten \u2013 I can\u2019t talk about what everyone else does \u2013 it goes a step or two further to provide a highly effective, prehabilitative and time-efficient full-body workout.\u2019\n\nThat all sounds great and, clearly Adele is a fan. But are we really going to take a popstar\u2019s endorsement at face value? Well, maybe. But Justin has expert insight into why it\u2019s such a beneficial form of exercise.\n\n\u2018We describe it as \u201cthe workout for the way we live now\u201d because it\u2019s ideal for stressed, time-poor, always-on 21st century desk-bound office workers who spend most of their days hunched over a computer.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWow. We have never felt more seen.\n\nThe benefits of reformer Pilates\n\nJustin has broken down the many benefits into bitesize chunks:\n\n1. It\u2019s great for addressing the postural impact of all that sitting, helping restore our natural spinal alignment and creating a strong, supportive core to prevent or reduce back pain and injury.\n\n2. It\u2019s ideal for the time poor. Although sessions last just less than an hour (including warm-up and cool-down), each one is a highly effective full-body workout.\n\n3. It has loads of benefits for your body, including:\n\nCorrecting posture\n\nStrengthening core muscle groups\n\nImproving flexibility\n\nSculpting lean, toned muscles\n\nCardiovascular benefits\n\nBoosting the resting metabolism\n\nReducing body fat and helping with both weight loss and weight management\n\n4. It\u2019s prehabilitative, meaning it offers a proactive, preventative approach to body maintenance that will keep you fitter, stronger and active for longer, and will help avoid/reduce the impact of future injury.\n\n5. Focusing as much on quality of movement as on intensity of effort, reformer Pilates requires so much focus, precision and control, that it\u2019s both immersive and mindful, making it a great time-out from day-to-day pressures and stresses.\n\n6.The dynamism and intensity of the workout helps to generate endorphins, increasing feelings of optimism, positivity and well-being. And, because you see the benefits fast, it\u2019s also a powerful way of boosting personal morale and maintaining motivation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho can do reformer Pilates?\n\nLuckily, Justin has a really simple answer for this one.\n\n\u2018Anyone.\n\n\u2018The reformer is one of the most effective and adaptable pieces of equipment available, and it\u2019s low-impact so safe for people of all ages and abilities.\n\n\u2018It can be used for anything from rehabilitation, helping recovery from the effects of illness, injury or surgery, to a highly intense and demanding workout that will challenge balance, flexibility, muscular strength and endurance, no matter how strong or fit you are.\u2019\n\nTips for first-timers Reformers can look a bit intimidating, but they\u2019re deceptively simple to use. If you\u2019re about to try it for the first time, don\u2019t try to learn it from a video or a book. Go to a class. Find a provider who offer beginner level classes \u2013 that way you\u2019ll get a proper introduction to the machine and how to use it. You\u2019ll also learn the basic techniques and exercises that underpin all Pilates routines, and you\u2019ll be with people who are all in the same position as you, so you wont have to compare yourself to people who\u2019ve been doing it for years, or be intimidated by exercises that you\u2019re not yet ready for.
