The Pumas had the lock Tom\u00e1s Lavanini sent off in the first quarter for a high tackle on Owen Farrell and their opponents took full advantage to book a guaranteed spot in the last eight.\n\nThey will now meet France in Yokohama on Saturday with the winners set to finish top of Pool C and, potentially, face Australia in the quarter-finals. England, in the meantime, will be sweating on the fitness of the No 8 Billy Vunipola, who hurt an ankle in the first half and did not reappear after half-time.\n\nEngland 39-10 Argentina: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 live! Read more\n\nBy then, however, the contest was in effect over, Lavanini having been sent off in the 18th minute for a tackle that made contact with the head of a stooping Farrell. Had the fly-half been standing upright it would probably have been a legal hit but players are now expected to allow some margin for error and, even at 6ft 7in tall, Lavanini should have aimed lower in the first instance.\n\nIt left the previously bubbling atmosphere around the ground suddenly as flat as a pancake, with the raucous Argentina fans not alone in feeling instantly deflated. Leicester may benefit if Lavanini arrives slightly earlier than planned in the east Midlands but, equally, Premiership referees will now be waiting for him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nigel Owens sends off Tom\u00e1s Lavanini (centre) with Argentina trailing only 5-3.

Youngs\u2019s effort was scored from closer range but was a nice way to mark his 92nd cap, putting him third on England\u2019s all-time Test appearance list.\n\nVunipola will have rather less fond memories of the evening. His departure left his side with three specialist flankers in the back row but, on this occasion, it mattered not. Ford, alert as ever, dived over for the bonus point score five minutes after the restart and Farrell, having rediscovered his kicking boots, added the conversion and a subsequent penalty.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nFurther late tries for the Exeter pair of Jack Nowell and Luke Cowan-Dickie completed a forgettable night for a frustrated Argentina, who last failed to qualify for the knockout stages at a Rugby World Cup back in 2003. Their only modest consolations was a second-half try for the winger Mat\u00edas Moroni and an 88th cap off the bench for their captain, Agust\u00edn Creevy, making him the most capped player in his country\u2019s history.", "description": "England are into the knockout stages of the Rugby World Cup with a game to spare after a 39-10 victory over an Argentina side who had Tom\u00e1s Lavanini sent off when trailing only 5-3", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99278063839d7f73bd1bd7b6ac771debcdad56c9/0_141_3331_1998/master/3331.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e7288fd572cb48e5e3d459ad16d7bc55", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
