The House is waiting for the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys to receive security clearances, said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,\u201d Mr. Schiff said on ABC. \u201cWe are taking all the precautions\u201d to protect his identity, he added.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nThe chairman said he hasn\u2019t set a timetable for concluding the investigation into Mr. Trump, a Republican up for re-election next year.\n\nA lawyer for the whistleblower said talks with lawmakers are ongoing. \u201cWe continue to work w/both parties in House & Senate and we understand all agree that protecting whistleblower\u2019s identity is paramount,\u201d the lawyer, Mark S. Zaid, wrote on Twitter. \u201cDiscussions continue to occur to coordinate & finalize logistics but no date/time has yet been set.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear how the whistleblower would testify without risking exposure of his identity. Any meeting with lawmakers would likely need to take place in a secure room\u2014known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF\u2014given the sensitivity of the information at issue, according to national security lawyers.\n\nWhile those rooms are available on Capitol Hill, appearing there likely would pose additional challenges to protect the whistleblower\u2019s anonymity given the number of people, especially reporters, in the halls of Congress. One alternative that the whistleblower\u2019s legal team and lawmakers may pursue would be to arrange a meeting in a SCIF at an executive branch agency, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nStephen Ryan, a lawyer at McDermott, Will & Emery LLP who specializes in congressional investigations, said there are two main hurdles: physically getting the whistleblower into Congress, and then limiting the number of people who hear him testify and read full transcripts.\n\n\u201cYou literally have to sneak them into the building\u2014you have to have a cordon that takes them in, perhaps through the House side, under the Capitol, coming out on the Senate side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know how to get people in and out of buildings without being identified. But when you share their identity with a group of people the chances of their exposure increases exponentially.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan added, \u201cAll you need is one [person] who wants to call a pal in the reporting world or who says something to their spouse or something to their boyfriend.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint, released last week, focuses on a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint alleges that Mr. Trump sought to use the powers of his office to push Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, and that White House officials acted to conceal evidence of the president\u2019s actions.\n\nMr. Trump struck out at Mr. Schiff on Twitter Sunday evening, saying the chairman falsely attributed words to him during Mr. Schiff\u2019s opening remarks at the Intelligence Committee\u2019s Thursday hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\n\u201cHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nMr. Trump also said he deserved to confront not only the whistleblower, who didn\u2019t have firsthand knowledge of the telephone call with Mr. Zelensky, \u201cbut also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u2018Whistleblower.\u2019 Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower complaint\u2019s description of the call with Mr. Zelensky aligned closely with the content of the reconstructed transcript released by the White House. The complaint said it drew from testimonials of more than a half-dozen unidentified U.S. officials who expressed concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nMr. Schiff has said his comments at the committee hearing were \u201cat least in part, parody.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing,\u201d Mr. Maguire said during the hearing. \u201cI think he followed the law every step of the way.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert on Sunday denounced the president for bringing up a debunked conspiracy theory during the call. Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to do another favor for the U.S. related to the U.S.-based cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which conducted forensic analysis of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer network after it was hacked in 2016.\n\nCrowdStrike concluded the hack was carried out by Russian intelligence officers, a finding corroborated by U.S. intelligence agencies and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election. But Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the conclusion of Russian involvement in the Democratic hacks, and said in an April 2017 interview that CrowdStrike\u2019s findings may not be credible because the company is \u201cUkrainian-based,\u201d which is false.\n\n\u201cThe DNC server and that conspiracy theory has got to go, they have to stop with that,\u201d Mr. Bossert, the former Trump adviser, said on ABC. \u201cIt cannot be repeated in our discourse.\u201d\n\nMr. Bossert was forced out of his job in April 2018 after months of internal frustration with his leadership and as the new national security adviser moved to establish power in the White House, the Journal reported last year.\n\nSeparately, Mr. Schiff said Sunday on NBC that he and other Democrats have yet to decide on whether to push for the president\u2019s personal attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to testify in the investigation.\n\nMr. Giuliani initially said Sunday on ABC that he wouldn\u2019t cooperate with Mr. Schiff\u2019s probe, accusing the congressman of lacking fairness. But he quickly changed his position, saying he would consider testifying.\n\n\u201cI have to be guided by my client,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s his privilege, not mine. If he decides he wants me to testify I will testify.\u201d\n\nMr. Schiff said in an interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night that the committee planned to issue a subpoena to Mr. Giuliani for evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s our intention as soon as first thing next week to subpoena him for documents,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there may very well come a time where we want to hear from him directly.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani is a key figure in the impeachment probe and is depicted in the whistleblower complaint released Thursday as eager to thrust himself into U.S. foreign policy. As the president\u2019s personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani pressed Ukraine to pursue an investigation of Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, according to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nProgressive advocacy group MoveOn.org on Sunday solicited donations to help the whistleblower, seeking $3 contributions it said would be split with Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit, nonpartisan legal organization that offers assistance to government employees who expose illegal activity.\n\nWhistleblower Aid operates a separate GoFundMe site seeking donations to assist the whistleblower. By Sunday night the site had raised about $162,000.\n\nA person familiar with the matter said the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys aren\u2019t involved in the fundraising and have never communicated with MoveOn. The person said the attorneys are working for the client pro bono, but Whistleblower Aid will be helping them financially.\n\nMoveOn and Whistleblower Aid didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.\n\nWrite to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com", "description": "The whistleblower at the center of the impeachment probe of President Trump will testify in the House \u201cvery soon,\u201d though in a way that will protect his identity, the Democrat leading the probe said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAI1ySv.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=476&y=471"}
