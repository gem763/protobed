Wie has spent nearly 20 years as one of women\u2019s golf\u2019s standard-bearers, but do not expect this Hawaii-born trailblazer to ride into the sunset any time soon.\n\nThe mini-sabbatical, which runs until early next year, has been refreshing, she admits. But approaching her 30th birthday on Friday, there is far more she wants to achieve.\n\n\u201cI know a big part of me doesn\u2019t want to end on an injury,\u201d she tells Telegraph Sport. \u201cI want it to be a voluntary end. I want to go out there and remember what it\u2019s like to play without pain. I want to go out there and remember how fun it was and how great the game is.\u201d\n\nIn Wie\u2019s whirlwind arrival in the sport she played alongside adults at 10, turned professional at 16, and entertained a queue of sponsors desperate to sign a girl who was out-driving the boys \u2013 and some men \u2013 on the golf course. It all meant that, by the time she was 18, Wie was ranked fourth in the 2007 Forbes\u2019 Top 20 earners under-25 list with an estimated \u00a315.4 million.", "description": "It was watching the pressure-soaked, hold-your-breath moment of Norwegian Suzann Pettersen sinking the winning putt at the Solheim Cup, and the shock retirement she announced straight after that reaffirmed Michelle Wie\u2019s position on her own future.", "authors": ["Vicki Hodges", "James Corrigan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212407981-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
