State broadcaster China Central Television and the livestreaming platform Tencent Sports both said they would no longer broadcast Rockets games.\n\nRead more:\n\n\n\nChina says it will stop broadcasting NBA games after Commissioner Adam Silver defended Daryl Morey\u2019s freedom to support Hong Kong protests\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the initial controversy, NBA commissioner Adam Silver has attempted to balance the league\u2019s values of free expression with its financial interests in spreading the game abroad.\n\nIn the NBA\u2019s first statement on the matter, Silver tried to split the difference, saying that Morey\u2019s comments causing offence to fans in China was \u201cregrettable,\u201d but clarifying that while they do not represent the feelings of the league or the Rockets, it \u201csupports individuals educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.\u201d\n\nSilver\u2019s initial statement didn\u2019t appear to appease the league\u2019s business partners in China. Multiple brands, ranging from streaming platforms to shoe companies, cut ties with the NBA.\n\nRead more:\n\n\n\nThe NBA has already felt \u2018economic impact\u2019 from Daryl Morey\u2019s pro-Hong Kong tweet \u2013 Here all the moves that have been made by China\n\n\n\nSilver put out a second statement on Tuesday, hoping to clear up the matter.\n\nIt began:\n\n\u201cI recognise our initial statement left people angered, confused, or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for. Let me be more clear.\n\nOver the last three decades, the NBA has developed a great affinity for the people of China. We have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China.\n\nAt the same time, we recognise that our two countries have different political systems and beliefs. And like many global brands, we bring our business to places with different political systems around the world.\u201d\n\nSilver also noted the diversity within the NBA, with 25% of the league\u2019s players were born outside of the United States. Also, the NBA has offices around the world, including Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Taipei.\n\n\u201cWith that diversity comes the belief that whatever our differences, we respect and value each other; and, what we have in common, including a belief in the power of sports to make a difference, remains our bedrock principle.\n\nIt is inevitable that people around the world \u2014 including from America and China \u2014 will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\n\nHowever, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees, and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nSilver concluded that the league believes sports \u201ccan be a unifying force that focuses on what we have in common as human beings rather than our differences.\u201d\n\nSilver also said he still planned to attend the scheduled preseason game between the Lakers and Nets on Thursday in Shanghai. He also hopes to meet with officials to discuss the matter and \u201cput those remarks from Daryl Morey and my remarks in the appropriate context of a decades-long relationship and see if we can find a mutual respect for each other\u2019s political systems and beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe NBA, and Silver\u2019s tenure as league commissioner, has been viewed mostly as a progressive presence in the American sports landscape in recent years. Silver\u2019s first major move as commissioner was the removal of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling. He was banned for life by the league after recordings of racist remarks became public.\n\nSince then, the league has defined itself as a place where athletes and coaches are free to speak their minds on issues relating to race and politics. Recent examples include head coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr speaking out against gun violence, and LeBron James calling the president a \u201cbum.\u201d This has stood in sharp contrast to the NFL, which has seemingly worked to stifle players\u2019 freedom of expression in favour of, for lack of a better term, \u201csticking to sports.\u201d\n\nBut the NBA\u2019s relationship with China \u2013 a market worth billions for the league \u2013 makes this controversy especially delicate and challenging to navigate. How Silver and the league attempt to resolve the issue will speak volumes.\n\nRead more:\n\nZion Williamson needed just 3 dunks in 28 minutes to have NBA fans drooling over his potential in his debut\n\nThe hype is growing around Mitchell Robinson, the Knicks\u2019 21-year-old centre who\u2019s drawing rave reviews in training camp\n\nJimmy Butler arrived for the first Heat practice at 3:30 a.m., and now other players are following suit\n\nNBA POWER RANKINGS: Where every team stands heading into training camp after a wild offseason\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
