It is building a network of 12,000 charging stations for it, and future electric vehicles. It will call its network FordPass.\n\nThe new Mach E will have Mustang styling, a 300-mile range and a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) price of about $40,000. If that sounds high, consider that a 2018 Ford F-250 pick-up truck was selling today on Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) for $45,000.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFord has bet $11 billion on electrics and hybrids under the name Project Edison. The Mach E will be the first of 16 electric vehicles it hopes to introduce by 2022. Within three years most of Ford\u2019s product line will have electric versions.\n\nElectric Vehicles Are the Future\n\nThe electric car market is growing. So far most of the growth is in China. The U.S. had 209,000 electrics delivered in the first half of the year, one-third of them were Tesla models.\n\nBut there may be as many as 40 different electric models on the road by 2025. Ford is betting a common platform it has endorsed with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY) will give it a leg-up on both electric and self-driving vehicles. Ford CEO Jim Hackett has called this the \u201cbiggest shift in in transportation\u201d since Henry Ford\u2019s Model T.\n\nWhen the Model T came out in 1908 there were electric cars on the road. But the U.S. electric grid was still primitive, still mostly used for lighting. Gasoline was cheap, plentiful and easily available. That\u2019s why the charging network, and self-charging kits Ford will produce for the home, are so important.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Skeptical Market\n\nThe stock market doesn\u2019t believe any of this. Since Hackett became CEO in May 2017 Ford stock is down 16.6% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28%. Even General Motors (NYSE:GM) is up 9%.\n\nFord continues to earn its 15 cents per share dividend most of the time, but the yield on that dividend is up to 6.6%, an indication the market doesn\u2019t consider it sustainable. A string of poor quarterly results, including the June quarter\u2019s 4 cents per share income, have the price-to-earnings ratio up over 16. Ford\u2019s stock recently bounced off a 10-year low and opens for trade Oct. 18 at about $9.09 per share.\n\nFord is next expected to deliver earnings on Oct. 23, with 26 cents per share expected on revenue of $34.1 billion. Right now, Ford stock is selling for barely one-fourth its annual revenue. By contrast retailer Kohl\u2019s (NYSE:KSS) sells for about half its revenue.\n\nWith the end of the GM strike in sight, Ford faces tough negotiations with the United Auto Workers, who will see the GM numbers as a benchmark.\n\nFord is also being hit by the U.S.-China trade war. Its sales in China dropped 30% in the third quarter.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Ford Stock\n\nDespite all the bad news, more hedge funds have been buying Ford shares recently. There are even some analysts serving small investors who recommend the stock in the near term. Its big pick-up trucks and SUVs continue to sell, and the U.S. consumer remains flush, giving it a bridge to the electric future.\n\nI\u2019ve had Ford in my own retirement account, but the fall of the stock price didn\u2019t make up for the dividend. I lost money and got out. Despite an incredible yield, Ford is still a speculation.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.
