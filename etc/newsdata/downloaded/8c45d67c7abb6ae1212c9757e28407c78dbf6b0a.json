His Liberals draw important benefits in the way the vote is split between regions and parties.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 A new POLITICO/Abacus Data poll that tracks campaign issues offers warning signs for both parties. Liberals have reason to fear, for instance, that voters back Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer on what they call their No. 1 issue: the cost of living. That was before Scheer announced Sunday a new tax cut proposal.\n\n\u2014 There\u2019s new optimism about passing USMCA this year. Developments in the U.S. are reviving the new North American trade pact as a Canadian campaign issue.\n\nC\u2019EST LUNDI \u2014 Welcome to POLITICO Pro Canada\u2019s morning newsletter.

An aggregate of polls that Abacus Data compiled puts Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives at 35 percent and Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals at 34 percent \u2014 well within the margin of error. Two minority parties are also showing strong, with the New Democratic Party at 12 percent and the Green Party at 11 percent.\n\nLiberal strongholds: We find two possible advantages for Trudeau within the topline numbers. First, the Liberals hold a 15-point lead in Quebec and a four-point lead in Ontario, where dozens of seat results will mostly decide the election.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s a near-perfect split to Trudeau\u2019s left: The Greens and NDP are virtually tied, which means progressive voters have no clear alternative to Trudeau if they want to beat the Conservatives. If Trudeau manages to keep progressive voters united behind him, and the big provinces in his column, he\u2019ll be tough to beat.\n\nMuch can change over 40 days: David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data, said it\u2019s too soon to read much into the horse-race numbers, as late-campaign shifts in the third- and fourth-party vote share can flip results in dozens of ridings and render meaningless the early national and provincial numbers. In this election, Coletto plans to track opinion on the underlying issues that motivate voters. In addition, Abacus has begun tracking groups of swing voters, who could drive the election.\n\n\n\nWHAT MATTERS TO VOTERS \u2014 Each week, POLITICO and Abacus Data will examine Canadian public opinion ahead of the election. The first POLITICO/Abacus Data poll indicates that cost of living is by far the No. 1 issue for Canadian voters, with 56 percent identifying it as one of their top five issues of concern. Here are other takeaways from the survey, and check out our interactive to drill down on the poll results:\n\n\u2014 Advantage, Scheer. The Conservatives hold an edge on the issue of cost of living. About 27 percent of respondents credit the Conservatives with having the best approach on this important topic, 18 percent credit the Liberals and 16 percent identified the NDP.\n\nBut the gap narrows when respondents are forced to make a binary choice between the top two parties: 52 percent say the Conservatives have the best approach, 48 percent say it\u2019s the Liberals. Scheer sought to press his advantage by announcing a new tax cut proposal on Sunday. Pros, read more from Catherine on this topic.\n\n\u2014 Polarization works for Trudeau. This poll offers striking evidence of what happens when you turn the election into an either/or choice between Trudeau\u2019s Liberals and Scheer\u2019s Conservatives: If voters perceive the race as a two-way contest, Trudeau benefits hugely.\n\nTake the question of climate change. If you list all the existing parties and ask voters who has the best climate policy, just 23 percent pick the Liberals, versus 40 percent for the Greens.\n\nBut ask voters to pick between the two leading parties and it\u2019s a rout: 75 percent of respondents prefer the Liberal climate approach, giving them a whopping 50-point advantage over the Conservatives. Expect Trudeau to explicitly make this case to progressive voters as the campaign enters its final stretch.\n\n\u2014 Immigration: warning sign for progressives. Respondents overwhelmingly sided with the Conservatives when asked which of the top two parties\u2019 approaches they most preferred on immigration: 69 percent, versus 31 percent for Trudeau\u2019s Liberals. That\u2019s despite the two front-running parties holding substantively similar policies.\n\nYet the immigration rhetoric has gotten more heated for two reasons: a spike in irregular border-crossings from the U.S., coupled with the creation of a fringe newright-wing populist party that wants to reduce Canada\u2019s immigrant intake.\n\n\u2014 There\u2019s no runaway winner on the issues. It\u2019s not just the horse-race that\u2019s close. The parties are running neck-and-neck on issues-based questions too. On a list of the top 10 issues identified by survey respondents, the respondents prefer the Liberal approach and the Conservative one five times each.\n\nWhen presented with that Liberal-versus-Conservative binary choice, respondents favor Trudeau\u2019s party on health care, climate change, poverty, housing and cost of medicines. They prefer Scheer\u2019s party on cost of living, taxes, economic vision, fiscal balance and immigration.\n\n\u2014 The broader calculus. With 338 seats up for grabs, a variety of issues can drive voters on the local level.

One private-sector official says the administration showed \u201csignificant flexibility\u201d in addressing Democrats\u2019 concerns about enforcement, labor, environment and pharmaceuticals. GOP House Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) has said he wants an implementing bill to clear the House before Canada\u2019s Oct. 21 election.\n\n\u2014 Event No. 2: A new book by Trump adviser Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the Blackstone Group. The Globe and Mail reports that in the book, \u201cWhat It Takes,\u201d Schwarzman takes credit for advising Trudeau to make concessions in order to save the new NAFTA.\n\nWe\u2019re a bit surprised by this account. In the fall of 2018, while talks were in trouble, Canadian officials told us that they had previously made clear they were ready to grant more access to Canada\u2019s dairy market \u2014 but only if they got what they wanted on other top priorities, like preserving the Chapter 19 anti-dumping dispute mechanism. And that\u2019s what happened in the final days of bargaining.\n\nMaking political hay: Scheer jumped onto the Schwarzman story. He tweeted a thread over the weekend that said: \u201cCanadians already know Justin Trudeau backed down to Donald Trump on NAFTA. Now we know that Trudeau sold them out at the express wishes of Donald Trump\u2019s billionaire friends.\u201d Despite those complaints, Scheer reiterated on Sunday that he would vote to ratify the new agreement.\n\nNORTHERN EXPOSURE\n\n\u2014 A former high-level RCMP intelligence official was charged with leaking state secrets. His arrest was reportedly based on a tip from the U.S. The official oversaw a Russian money-laundering investigation, according to Bill Browder, the force behind the global Magnitsky Act. Globe and Mail.\n\n\u2014 President Donald Trump pledged to respond after a drone attack halved Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production and drove up oil prices.
