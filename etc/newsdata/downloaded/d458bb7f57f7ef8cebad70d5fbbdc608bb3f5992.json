Walmart was the first to make a surprise announcement on its new gun policies Tuesday afternoon. CEO Doug McMillon sent a company-wide email outlining the retailers revised gun policies following two deadly shootings earlier this year at Walmart stores in El Paso, Texas and Southhaven, Mississippi. Walmart plans to stop selling two different kinds of short-barrel rifle ammunition and will completely stop selling handgun ammunition. The retailer also announced that it would be stopping the sale of handguns altogether in Alaska, which was the last state where handguns were sold in Walmart stores. Walmart currently commands about 20% of the total ammunition market share, but with the new move will bring down that market share to about 6% to 9%.\n\n\u201cWe know these decisions will inconvenience some of our customers, and we hope they will understand. As a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same,\u201d McMillon said. Finally, Walmart asked its customers to respectfully stop carrying firearms opening in its stores.\n\nOn the heels of Walmart\u2019s request, Kroger also formally asked its customers to hold off from carrying guns openly in its stores. Though it is not an official ban, Kroger is also attempting to use its influence to promote gun reform. \u201cKroger is respectfully asking that customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores, other than authorized law enforcement officers,\u201d Jessica Adelman, group vice president of corporate affairs, said in a statement. \u201cWe are also joining those encouraging our elected leaders to pass laws that will strengthen background checks and remove weapons from those who have been found to pose a risk for violence.\u201d", "description": "Stock rebounded Wednesday after investors cheered Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam\u2019s decision to withdraw the extradition bill that triggered months of violent protests.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rqeIz83NEyLyLG_Z.65jXQ--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/923e3f00-ca53-11e9-bfff-c317626bb60b"}
