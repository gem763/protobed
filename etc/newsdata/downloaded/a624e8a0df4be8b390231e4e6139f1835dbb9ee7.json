On Urban Dictionary, early definitions of the word describe females who play video games to lure men in with their \u201ccool girl\u201d personas.\n\n\u201cIn short, it\u2019s a misogynist insult born of boys fantasising that girls who share their hobbies are clamouring for their time and energy,\u201d writes BuzzFeed reporter Lauren Strapagiel.\n\nHowever, in recent years and alongside the rise in popularity of TikTok, teenagers have reclaimed the name and label as a clear indicator of their own popularity, as proven by their thousands of followers.\n\nOn Instagram, a search for the hashtag \u201cegirl\u201d results in more than 600,000 posts. On TikTok, where it can be argued the trend started, there are countless videos showing teens transform themselves into e-girls.\n\nWhile the term may have started as an insult, female teenagers have managed to embrace the label, turning it into a persona that is both cool and enviable.", "description": "An entire generation came of age on the internet, and high school cliques have morphed into an online phenomenon - creating\u00a0an entirely new group of subcultures.\u00a0 Hipsters have been replaced by the VSCO girl, while the characteristics that were once used to label someone \u201cscene\u201d or emo may now be applied to \u201ce-girls\u201d.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/16/istock-1005864440.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
