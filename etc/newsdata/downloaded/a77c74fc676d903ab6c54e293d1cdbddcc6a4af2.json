A handful of politicians have garnered attention recently by bringing their young children to work. Sen.Tammy Duckworth brought her 10-day old daughter onto the Senate floor for a vote last year. New Zealand's prime minister took her baby to the United Nations. A countryman of hers fed an infant while presiding over Parliament.\n\nAcceptance of children in the workplace is spreading beyond these high-profile examples. More and more companies are establishing rules that allow children to accompany their parents in the office, whether just on occasion or regularly.\n\nFour states \u2014 Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and Washington \u2014 have Infant at Work policies that permit some state workers to bring babies to the office up to age 6 months or until they can crawl.\n\nWhy there's debate:\n\nProponents of these policies say they can help alleviate the sometimes overwhelming cost of childcare and improve employee work-life balance. It can also benefit employers, some argue, because workers may choose to take less parental leave if their office environment is more flexible.\n\nSupporters also make the case that exposure to a parent's work life can help children better understand why their caregiver spends so much time away. It can also make a worker's colleagues see the individual as a complete person rather than just a co-worker.\n\nThe policies have gotten pushback for a number of reasons. Chief among them is how disruptive kids can be, especially toddlers. A parent bringing a child to work may benefit one employee, but it could hurt the productivity of an entire office. Others point out that only a limited number of workplaces are appropriate \u2014 either for logistical or safety reasons \u2014 for children to be present.\n\nSome favor a middle ground where it's understood that kids can be brought to the office only in the case of a rare emergency or that only infants who are too young to crawl are allowed.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nCalifornia's legislature recently passed a bill that would make it the fifth state to allow government workers to bring babies to the office. A similar bill was recently proposed in Utah.\n\nPerspectives\n\nSupporters\n\nExposure to working life can deepen the connection between parent and child\n\n\"I encourage all of you not just to bring your kids \u2014 girls and boys \u2014 to work. Bring them into your work. Whether you work from home or bring them to the office as I do, show them how hard and fulfilling and fun it can be, all at the same time. And help them understand how and why it fuels you personally and professionally to make an impact on the lives outside the four walls of your home.\" \u2014 Christine Taylor, CNN\n\nThe modern economy leaves parents with fewer childcare choices than in the past\n\n\"The reality is that most Americans can no longer rely on the traditional nuclear family to raise the next generation. Our villages have dissolved, and while we often call on family, friends or, as is usually the case, paid childcare to fill in the gaps, the idea that our work identities are somehow fully separate from our home selves clearly has damaging consequences for all.\" \u2014 Kaitlin Solimine, Guardian\n\nSeeing a co-worker as a parent can be humanizing\n\n\u201cThere will be times when your child is sick, or has an important event, and when people you work with know your kids, there\u2019s a caring there that they would not otherwise have.\u201d \u2014 Workplace expert Cali Williams Yost to New York Times\n\nBusinesses don't provide enough support to working parents\n\n\"In banning children from professional settings while failing to provide alternative childcare options, employers put working parents in an untenable position.\" \u2014 Darlena Cunha, Quartz\n\nDetractors\n\nChildren are too disruptive\n\n\"It turns out, kids can be noisy! And it can be tough to focus on work if your colleagues\u2019 kids are anything other than quiet and well-behaved.\" \u2014 Alison Green, Slate\n\nOnly children up to a certain age should be allowed\n\n\"There's a certain period \u2014 after that first crazy month but pre-crawling \u2014 when babies are super portable. Set up a bouncy chair or a Pack N' Play, and they're gonna make themselves at home (and sleep) wherever they are.\" \u2014 Heather Marcoux, Motherly", "description": "A push to allow some workers to bring their children to the office is gaining traction.
