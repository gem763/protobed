And on Tuesday evening they were put through the wringer.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat spent much of the evening\u2019s Democratic primary debate being dragged by her opponents. It was a different treatment from what she received in the past, when she often managed to skate through the debates without drawing attacks or ire.\n\nBut that ended on the stage inside Otterbein College\u2019s Rike Center. And it signified that Warren\u2019s steady rise in the polls has turned her insurgent candidacy into that of a frontrunner.\n\nAfter The New York Times\u2019 Marc Lacey asked Warren to answer yes or no whether her Medicare for All plan would raise taxes on the middle class\u2014as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has conceded would happen under his similar proposal\u2014Warren launched into a detailed, and now familiar, dodge.\n\nPressed again by the moderator, she did it again.\n\n\u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hardworking middle-class families, costs will go down,\u201d Warren said, side stepping the \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d request.\n\nWhen asked to respond, Mayor Pete Buttigieg called her out.\n\n\u201cYou heard it tonight: a yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said. \u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d\n\nThen Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) brought down the hammer.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is a plan is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nIt was the beginning of a sustained attack of Warren and her canon of plans, seemingly aimed at bringing her and her poll numbers down to earth as well as highlight the moderate options in a primary that has increasingly rewarded the most liberal proposals. The exchanges also provided a glimpse into what the next few months could look like for Warren should she remain at or near the top of the pack.\n\nDuring the conversation about Warren\u2019s wealth tax\u2014a plan to tax the ultra wealthy at 2 percent or 3 percent depending on their income, several candidates sought to shut down the senator\u2019s claim that she and Sanders were the only candidates willing to go up against the super rich.\n\n\u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax,\u201d Warren said during one defense of her proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is supporting billionaires,\u201d former vice president Joe Biden interjected.\n\nFrom there, Klobuchar picked up the baton. \u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d\n\nWarren responded, \u201cLook, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.\u201d\n\nTo which Klobuchar replied, \u201cYou know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re fighting for regular people.\u201d\n\nThe exchanges between Warren and several of the candidates weren\u2019t the only contentious moments of a three-hour marathon debate featuring 12 presidential hopefuls. A heated exchange over how the U.S. should extract itself from the conflict in Syria between Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) offered a stark contrast between the two military veterans on the stage.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump shocked the international community last week after his surprise removal of U.S. troops stationed on Syrian border triggered an immediate invasion from Turkey, whose forces slaughtered Kurdish fighters who have fought alongside U.S. troops against ISIS for years. The action drew condemnation from both sides of the aisle, and was viewed as a betrayal of a vulnerable ally.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/GettyWESTERVILLE, Ohio\u2014Elizabeth Warren has plans.
