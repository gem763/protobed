It was my first public appearance after being raped. And I thought, it was kind of like Russell Crowe and Gladiator when it comes out in the ring and he\u2019s like, \u201cAre you not entertained?\u201d\n\n\u2018And that was why I did that. That was my response to being assaulted.\u2019\n\nRose alleges that she was raped by Harvey Weinstein (Picture: Dave Benett/Getty Images)\n\nRose previously told Dr Oz that the dress was a \u2018political statement\u2019, saying: \u2018 Of course, there was no Twitter at the time or Instagram, no way to speak for yourself.\u2019\n\nMcGowan alleges that she was raped by Harvey Weinstein at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997.\n\nIn her autobiography Brave, McGowan refers to the shamed producer as \u2018the Monster\u2019 and alleges that after discussing her career in his hotel career, Weinstein held her down on the edge of a jacuzzi and raped her.\n\nShe wrote: \u2018I felt so dirty. I had been so violated and I was sad to the core of my being. I kept thinking about how he\u2019d been sitting behind me in the theater the night before it happened. Which made it \u2013 not my responsibility, exactly, but \u2013 like I had had a hand in tempting him. Which made it even sicker and made me feel dirtier.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeinstein has been accused of assault and sexual misconduct by over 80 women, and could face life in prison after being charged with five counts of sexual abuse, including rape.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
