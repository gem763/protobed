The tweet appeared to make light of that alleged incident.\n\n\u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun,\u201d it read. \u201cBut when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\u2019t belong at Yale in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe post sparked an immediate backlash from social media users who called out its insensitivity, prompting the Times to issue a follow-up tweet, writing, \u201cIt was offensive, and we apologize.\u201d\n\nProgrebin on Tuesday said she drafted the tweet \u201cto have actually the opposite effect, which is to anticipate those who would say, \u2018A guy pulling down his pants at a party when they\u2019re drunk is \u2015 on the spectrum of sexual misconduct \u2015 it\u2019s not sexual assault, it\u2019s not rape, what\u2019s the big deal?\u2019\u201d\n\nProgrebin said she also aimed to contextualize \u201cRamirez\u2019s experience and to say actually it was a big deal and that this can be quite meaningful, depending on what you come from.\u201d\n\nRamirez is described in the essay as the product of a sheltered Catholic household who spent summers working at an ice cream parlor and financed her tuition with loans and work-study gigs. She is also a person of color born to a Puerto Rican father and, Progrebin said, \u201cfelt like maybe she didn\u2019t deserve to be at Yale in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so having that happen, to have people laugh at her and target her, was actually hugely meaningful and made an impact on her life for the rest of her life,\u201d Progrebin added.\n\nPartially overshadowed by the controversy over the tweet was the new allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to another woman at Yale during a drunken party.\n\nThe new account was attributed to another of the justice\u2019s former classmates, Max Stier, who according to Progrebin and Kelly contacted the FBI about it during the confirmation process for Kavanaugh. Stier supposedly witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down at the dorm party while friends pushed his penis into a female student\u2019s hands.\n\nThe reporters said Stier declined to discuss the allegation publicly, but that they corroborated the account story with two unnamed officials who have communicated with him. The Times later made an addition to the online version of the article noting that Progrbein and Kelly\u2019s book says that the female student in question \u201cdeclined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.\u201d\n\nThe oversight in the original version of the article, in addition to the uproar over the tweet, spurred criticism that the story was mishandled by the Times\u2019 opinion desk, which operates separately from its news department.", "description": "A reporter owns up to writing the \"misworded\" post that described an act of sexual misconduct as seemingly \"harmless fun.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d81364a2300001c05569dde.jpeg?cache=robnbrfmob&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
