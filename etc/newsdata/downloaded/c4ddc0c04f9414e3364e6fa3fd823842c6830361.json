Among the questions he raised was whether the utility is too large, with a service area covering more than 40 counties.\n\nHe also faulted PG&E for putting what he called \u201cgreed\u201d ahead of investments in its infrastructure to protect the electrical grid from dangerous winds.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.\n\nPG&E Chief Executive Bill Johnson acknowledged that his company had left \u201cmillions of people\u201d without a \u201cfundamental service\u201d they expect and deserve.\n\n\u201cThis is not how we want to serve you,\u201d he told a media briefing in San Francisco, adding that PG&E \u201cwas not adequately prepared\u201d for such a large power outage.\n\n\u2018THIRD WORLD COUNTRY\u2019\n\nAs high winds moved south, a similar cutoff was under way by neighboring utility Southern California Edison, which warned that more than 173,000 customers could lose power in parts of eight counties, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Downtown Los Angeles is seen behind an electricity pylon through the morning marine layer in Los Angeles, California, U.S., August 20, 2019. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson /File Photo\n\nResidents, business owners and even public officials expressed frustration about the blackouts, which the utility began on a much smaller scale last year during times of high fire risk.\n\n\u201cNorthern California is not a Third World country,\u201d the San Jose Mercury Statesman said in an editorial. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that the region is being forced to endure this level of disruption as the long-term strategy for dealing with the threat of wildfires.\u201d\n\nPG&E, California\u2019s biggest investor-owned utility, said it had restored power to 126,000 customers by Thursday morning but a further phase of cuts was expected to hit 4,000 more.\n\nPower will be restored to areas once up to 77 mph (124 kph) winds die down and 2,500 miles (4,025 km) of transmission lines could be inspected.\n\n\u201cWe faced a choice between hardship or safety, and we chose safety,\u201d Michael Lewis, PG&E\u2019s senior vice president of electric operations, said in a statement.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the hot gusty winds that usually hit northern California in October, sometimes called the \u201cDiablo Winds\u201d, will continue into Friday morning.\n\nMuch of northern California, from San Francisco to the Oregon border, remains under a state \u201cred flag\u201d fire alert, although no major blazes have been reported.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the weather passes, PG&E will begin safety inspections with 6,300 field personnel and 45 helicopters standing at the ready once we get the all clear,\u201d the utility said in a tweet on Thursday.\n\nECONOMIC COST\n\nOakland supermarkets brought in refrigeration trucks to save food and Montclair businesses like Laurie Shepherd\u2019s dental clinic were unable to tell patients when they would reopen.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring,\u201d said Shepherd by phone, after she tore a tendon rushing to prepare for the outages. \u201cWe were just left up in the air.\u201d\n\nMichael Wara of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment estimated the economic cost of the shutdown could reach $2.5 billion, with small businesses hit hardest as they typically lacked back-up generators.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) workers walk during a gas line inspection in a neighborhood destroyed by the Tubbs Fire, in Santa Rosa, California, U.S., October 12, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo\n\nIn Santa Rosa, a California wine country town where entire subdivisions were destroyed by a deadly 2017 wildfire, restaurateurs Mark and Terri Stark said they had to close one of their six restaurants after it lost power.\n\n\u201cThis is preventative medicine and medicine sometimes is not good to take,\u201d said Mark Stark, 60, who lost one restaurant in the 2017 blaze. The fires in that region killed 46 people.\n\n\u201cThose fires and what they caused are still very real for people in our \u2018hood,\u201d he said.", "description": "California Governor Gavin Newsom called a widespread electricity shutdown triggered by a power company to prevent wildfires \"unacceptable,\" saying on Thursday it resulted from years of mismanagement by the utility.", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439469621&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF992DI", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
