Sarah stands behind a stall piled high with heirloom tomatoes, basil, okra, and acorn squash. With a towheaded baby in her arms, she greets customers and makes small talk. She and Douglas own Schooner Creek Farm in nearby Nashville, Indiana. They\u2019re crunchy\u2014even for Bloomington, a college town with a distinctly earthy vibe. You\u2019d never guess that in private far-right chat rooms, Sarah goes by \u201cVolkmom.\u201d She posts about home schooling, recommends books by neo-Nazis, and complains about the \u201cstrife\u201d faced by \u201cWhites\u201d who live in \u201cnon-white\u201d neighborhoods. She also occasionally writes about farming.\n\nFascists have long shared Volkmom\u2019s preoccupation with green living. The past few years have seen a resurgence of eco-fascist and eco-nationalist themes in the rhetoric of Europe\u2019s far-right parties and in the writings of online radicals. Some, inspired by Netflix\u2019s recent thriller about Ted Kaczynski, have embraced the Unabomber\u2019s nihilist primitivism. Others have adopted Norse aesthetics and a radically anti-humanist version of \u201cdeep ecology.\u201d Both the Christchurch and El Paso mass shooters included environmentalist themes in their white-nationalist manifestos.\n\nWhen writing about eco-fascists, the media often speaks of green politics \u201cmasking\u201d a darker racial vision. But most eco-fascists are sincere in their environmentalism. \u201cThe common theme,\u201d said Peter Staudenmaier, a professor of history at Marquette University, \u201cis this link between a yearning for purity in the environmental sphere and a desire for racialized purity in the social sphere.\u201d For people like Dye and Mackey, the nation is an ecosystem, and nonwhite immigrants are an invasive species.\n\nThe Nazi slogan \u201cBlood and Soil\u201d \u00adreentered public discourse two years ago, when torch-wielding neo-Nazis chanted it in Charlottesville. But the phrase actually predates the Third Reich. In the nineteenth century, German romantic writers like Ernst Moritz Arndt and Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl synthesized naturalism and nationalism. \u201cWe must save the forest,\u201d Riehl wrote in 1853, \u201cnot only so that our ovens do not become cold in winter, but also so that the pulse of life of the people continues to beat warm and joyfully, so that Germany remains German.\u201d", "description": "Eco-fascism is fashionable again on the far right, thanks to a rise in global temperatures and anti-immigrant nationalism.", "authors": ["Sam Adler-Bell"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/960c197c5a15b48ae1496d6831ec90fb0fdb7c30.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
