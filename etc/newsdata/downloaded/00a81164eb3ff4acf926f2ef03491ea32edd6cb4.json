Lived in basically very humble beginnings. Came out of it. Ups and downs, and this and that,' she explained. 'And public humiliation and going through the wringer.'\n\nMariah continued: 'But then you have an Emancipation of Mimi moment. You have to relish that moment, be around real people that care about you and just shake off the other nonsense.'\n\nThe singer released the Emancipation of Mimi, which she called a moment of real 'female empowerment' in her career, a few years after some major upheaval in her personal life.\n\n'Born to a black father and white mother. Lived in basically very humble beginnings. Came out of it. Ups and downs, and this and that,' she explained. 'And public humiliation and going through the wringer.' (Pictured the year she debuted her first album in 1990)\n\nShe had split from her husband Tommy Mottola and later suffered an embarrassing public breakdown in 2001 that led to her being hospitalized for two weeks due to 'extreme exhaustion.'\n\nIn the memoir, Mariah will delve into the breakdown which she called 'alleged' to Variety.\n\n'It was an emotional and physical breakdown, but it wasn\u2019t a nervous breakdown,' she explained, 'because you don\u2019t recover from that really.'\n\nIn the pages: Mariah told Variety that she won't shy away from tough topics like her 2001 breakdown which she referred to as 'alleged' (Pictured in 2001 following her hospitalization)\n\nAdding: And even my therapist was like, \"You didn\u2019t have a breakdown; you had a diva fit and people couldn\u2019t handle it.\"\n\n'And that is something we should explore, because if a woman gets too emotional or too loud or too abrasive or too real, suddenly it\u2019s like, \"What\u2019s wrong with her? She\u2019s crazy.\"'\n\nThe star then addressed her diva-like reputation: 'These people are here making money off me; why don\u2019t they care if nobody\u2019s got an umbrella for me, and it\u2019s a sunny shoot? And the minute I was like, \"I\u2019m not fine; I need a day off, I need a moment.\" Nobody could handle it because they infantilized me from the beginning.\"\n\nAddressing her diva reputation: 'These people are here making money off me; why don\u2019t they care if nobody\u2019s got an umbrella for me, and it\u2019s a sunny shoot?'\n\n'And by the way, I do need someone to be like, \"Ok, we\u2019ve got to go; you\u2019re running late.\" Yeah, I am like a petulant child. But my true fans know this. I\u2019m eternally 12. But we\u2019re artists.'\n\nAs an artist, the star said she's grown over her decades in the spotlight and has worked hard to get out from under the thumb of powerful men in the industry.\n\nShe plans on opening up in the book about her personal and professional relationship with her music exec ex Tommy Mottola, who was notoriously controlling, as well as sexism in the music industry on the whole.\n\nMariah still doesn't have a release date for the memoir but she said that it should be out late next year.", "description": "Mariah Carey will reflect on her insanely successful career in her upcoming memoir and opened up about the book in an interview for Variety's annual Power of Women issue.", "authors": ["Caitlyn Becker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/18/19453154-0-image-a-13_1570554400608.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
