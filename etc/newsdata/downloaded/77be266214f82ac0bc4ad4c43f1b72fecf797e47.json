His counterparts were Russian troops, many of which were airborne.\n\nTheir mission was to disrupt the movements of Albanian UCPMB rebels in the area. For six months, he and his Russian allies worked side-by-side, in the forests and mountains around Kosovo.\n\nThen one day, his coworkers put on what they called a \"Spetsnaz Show\" \u2014 and Giaconia realized who his tactical buddies really were.\n\nTo be clear, the \"Spetsnaz\" aren't any single part of the Russian military apparatus. They are any special operations unit of the Russian military, including the Russian Navy, Airborne troops, and FSB (formerly the KGB). Most often, when westerners refer to the Spetsnaz, they're referring to the special operations section of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service.\n\nMembers of the Russian Special Purpose Regiment (Spetsnaz) prepare to storm a building during a performanceat a military festival in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, February 21, 2012 Ilya Naymushin / Reuters\n\nGiaconia's experience with the Russians was his first \u2014 and it was the first time American Special Forces and Russian special operators worked together. The height of their mission in Kosovo was rolling on a rebel base that had killed one of the Russians' soldiers. The team captured a young rebel while on a patrol and extracted the location of the rebels' base of operations.\n\nGiaconia describes his time in Kosovo with his ODA in his book, \" One Green Beret: Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and beyond: 15 Extraordinary years in the life - 1996-2011.\"\n\nHe describes the joint US-Russian Special Forces outfit arriving in an area called Velja Glava, where the rebel camp was supposed to be. After dispatching the sentries, the joint team dismounted from their armored vehicles and moved through the forest to assault the camp. The Russians deftly traversed through the vegetation while Giaconia laid the forest bare with a Mk 19 grenade launcher.\n\nThe Russians captured the Albanian rebels that were still able to be captured, and the UCPMB camp was taken out of action permanently. When it came to the performance of the Spetsnaz in combat, Giaconia says they were keen on tactics and had great intuition and instinct. They could shoot well, took care of their weapons and equipment, and were in great shape, and were very well-disciplined.\n\nIn short, he says he had a lot of respect for these \"badasses in spirit.\"", "description": "They worked side-by-side in the forests and mountains around Kosovo to disrupt the movements of rebels in the area.", "authors": ["Blake Stilwell", "We Are The Mighty"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6e8cb32e22af7921360036-1334-667.jpg"}
