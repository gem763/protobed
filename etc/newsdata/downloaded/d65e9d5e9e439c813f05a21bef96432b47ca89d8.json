There was no facade. It's amazing that they're using their platforms to bring in young people and bring other people to the table and really try to make a difference.\n\n'She (Meghan) is loved and appreciated and looked to by so many of us and obviously the duke is also a role model of what a model man should be and how they should give the space to other identities and empower women, queer people and other minorities and look at people as people, and not just identities.\n\n'I think that anyone who tries to change a lot of things in the world is going to face all kinds of things. No one is going to be able to please everyone. If anything, it's an indication of how much she's trying to redefine and reshape a lot of the conversations we are used to traditionally.'\n\nThe roundtable is the couple's first public engagement together since their emotional television interview with tom Bradby on ITV, in which they described the struggles of the past year.\n\nIn the documentary the pair admitted to struggling with the media attention, but faced criticism in some quarters for their controversial views on and the public scrutiny they faced.\n\nIn contrast, Prince Charles' earned rave reviews for his show which aired on the same channel last night.\n\nSitting beside Meghan, on her right, is Amir Ashour, a human rights defender from Iraq.
