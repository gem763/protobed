That evening, demonstrators shattered the calm yet again.\n\nAbout two miles from the Four Seasons hotel where Ermotti was staying, protesters lobbed petrol bombs and started a massive fire outside a subway station. Police countered with tear gas and water cannons.\n\nBut by Monday morning, the streets were cleared and Hong Kong was back to business. Ermotti largely stuck to his itinerary, avoiding areas flagged by the firm\u2019s security team, a person familiar with the matter said. UBS\u2019s board meeting took place as scheduled and the firm hosted more than 200 clients and business leaders in a Four Seasons ballroom. There, over canapes, cocktails and Peking duck, Ermotti pledged that the Swiss bank would stay committed to Hong Kong.\n\nAlmost four months of protests have turned parts of Hong Kong into battle zones on weekends and holidays, wreaked havoc on the tourism industry and sent the $360 billion economy hurtling toward recession. Yet for all the chaos, the city has shown a remarkable ability to carry on with its role as one of the world\u2019s premier financial and commercial hubs.\n\nThe work week continues largely uninterrupted for most big companies, which have found ways to sidestep transport disruptions and pockets of violence. Their willingness, for now at least, to stick with with Hong Kong during its biggest political crisis since the 1997 handover to China underscores the city\u2019s importance as a gateway to Asia\u2019s largest economy.\n\nEven as speculation has grown that Chinese leaders will gradually sideline Hong Kong and elevate mainland financial centers in Shanghai and Shenzhen, the former British colony\u2019s advantages will be tough to match.\n\nHong Kong is a key market \u201cboth in its own right, as an entry point to China and to facilitate the cross-border business out of China,\u201d Ermotti said in an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg.\n\nAmong Hong Kong\u2019s biggest draws is an independent legal system that allows for the free flow of capital and information, something that\u2019s still lacking in mainland China. Investment banks such as UBS, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: )., and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) book large chunks of their China-related revenue in Hong Kong because they use the city to trade, finance and advise Chinese clients with overseas operations.\n\nAbout $16 billion of initial public offerings originated from Hong Kong this year, mostly involving mainland Chinese firms. Even as some smaller companies have reconsidered Hong Kong fundraising plans, Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd. went ahead with a $5 billion listing last month, the world\u2019s second-biggest IPO this year behind Uber Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc.\n\nAround the same time, international money managers flocked to Hong Kong for one of Asia\u2019s most important investment confabs, the SuperReturn Asia Private Equity Conference. Total attendance, at about 800, was little changed from previous years, said Dorothy Kelso, global head of SuperReturn.\n\n\u201dBy coming here I get a sense of what is happening with investors as Hong Kong is the gateway city to Asia,\u201d said Russell Deakin, managing partner at Aceana Group, who runs a family office based in Miami and visited Hong Kong for the conference.\n\nMany attendees said they simply scheduled their arrivals for times when their commutes from the airport were least likely to be disrupted by demonstrations. \u201cFor people who are truly serious and committed to China, the protests do not deter important business meetings,\u201d said Johan Riddergard, a Singapore-based partner at Venturous Group Ltd., one of the top sponsors of the SuperReturn conference.\n\nGlobal investors are taking their cues partly from Hong Kong\u2019s pragmatic residents, who have mostly continued to show up for work whether they\u2019ve taken part in protests or steered clear of them on weekends and holidays.\n\nThat remained true even after the city ground to a standstill on Oct. 1, when escalating violence on the 70th anniversary of Communist rule in China led the police to shoot a demonstrator for the first time. The next day, commuters headed back to their offices, financial markets operated normally and -- barring a few delays -- the city\u2019s famously efficient transportation system was up and running. The MSCI Hong Kong Index of local shares rose 0.3%, bucking regional declines.\n\nBusinesspeople that count on Hong Kong are learning to cope with the new normal. Lu Jianfeng, chairman of artificial intelligence startup Wiz Holding Pte, missed his flight after being stuck in traffic for hours in a cab during a September visit when protesters unexpectedly descended on a neighborhood he was passing through. But he returned for meetings with investors only a few weeks later, arriving on a Friday and leaving at the end of the day. \u201cI made sure my schedule was super compact,\u201d he said.\n\nThe risk, of course, is that the unrest escalates to the point that international businesses and investors start to lose patience with the city. For companies, maintaining a presence in Hong Kong also means navigating an increasingly fraught political environment.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways Ltd. came under fire from Chinese authorities after some of its employees joined the protests, with officials demanding that those workers be banned from flying over and into China. In August, the airline announced the resignation of its British-born chief executive officer, Rupert Hogg. Cathay\u2019s stock has tumbled 15% since mid-July.\n\nFor now though, global companies are finding it difficult to bypass the city. EY, better known as Ernst & Young, recently shifted a global management meeting from Hong Kong to London because of the protests, people familiar with the matter said. But the company is still hoping to hold a meeting in Hong Kong at a later stage because the city is a major hub for its business, the people said. An EY representative declined to comment.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s efforts to work around the unrest have at times made for some striking scenes. On a recent Sunday, construction workers with bulldozers and other heavy machinery made progress on a large-scale renovation of the city\u2019s landmark Hutchison House, part of the real estate empire built by billionaire Li Ka-shing. Work continued apace atop the building, even as a mass of protesters mobbed the streets around it.\n\n(Updates with added details on conference)", "description": "Violence on the Streets Can\u2019t Stop Deal-Making in Hong Kong", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf693ab7bf84d9b1411c3f6f9e880a395.jpg"}
