Here are a few tips.\n\nImage Credit Getty Images\n\nWhen you bring your baby home, you also bring home a bundle of new questions. Everyone has different opinions on the best way to do everything when it comes to raising babies; even a simple question like, \u201cHow often should I bathe this kid?\u201d can turn into a heated debate. To help you navigate the minefield of parenting advice, I spoke to a few experts to get the dirt on keeping baby clean.\n\nHow do I keep my new baby clean?\n\nIt may be tempting to follow the lead of commercials, slathering your baby daily in sweet-smelling soaps in the cute tub you got for your baby shower, then bundling her up in an adorable hooded towel. But hold on, doctors warn: Newborns and infants have delicate skin, and a soapy bath every day can do more harm than good.\n\n\u201cOver-bathing an infant may dry out the skin, making it itchy and rashy,\u201d explained Dr. Kelly M. Cordoro, M.D., a professor of dermatology and pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco who practices at UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cAn important distinction here is \u2018bathing\u2019 with soaps or other cleansers, versus \u2018soaking\u2019 in just water.\u201d Dr. Cordoro, who is also a committee chair for the Society for Pediatric Dermatology, advises new parents to use soap conservatively. \u201cIt can be very irritating and unnecessary, as it can wash away the top layer of protective skin cells, natural oils and normal healthy bacteria, leaving the skin dry, itchy and vulnerable to irritation and possibly skin infections.\u201d\n\nExperts suggest a warm bath at bedtime can be helpful in getting an otherwise unwilling baby to rest, but there\u2019s no need to use cleansers that often. A 10-15 minute soak in warm water followed by a liberal coating of moisturizer does the trick, leaving baby cozy and relaxed without the potentially damaging effects of soap on the skin. According to Dr. Cordoro, soapy baths no more than three times a week are sufficient as long as diaper areas are thoroughly cleaned at changing time.\n\nSince bathing can be stressful in the beginning, there are a few things all parents should keep in mind:\n\nAlways check the temperature of bath water. Baby skin is delicate and can scald easily. Check the water with your elbow, which is more sensitive to temperature than your hand. The water should be close to normal body temperature and feel neither hot nor cold to the touch.\n\nNever leave children unattended in the bath. Accidents can happen in a split second. Infants can slide from their bathing seats, and toddlers can slip and bump their heads. Err on the side of caution and, if you need to leave the room, ask another adult to step in \u2014 or grab a towel and take your child with you.\n\nBabies who are too young to sit unassisted should be bathed in an infant tub with a removable sling or seat that helps support their weight and keeps them from slipping. As babies get older and can sit on their own, the sling can be removed, allowing the baby to sit up in the tub. If a full-size tub must be used, ensure there is a non-slip mat in the bottom to prevent slips.\n\nWhat if my baby has a skin condition?\n\nEczema, the name for a group of skin conditions including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis, is characterized by red, itchy, localized skin inflammation. It\u2019s one of the most common childhood skin issues, affecting about 10 percent of children under 18, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive to give as few as two baths per week to babies with eczema; you want to keep inflamed areas clean, right? But soap and other cleansers can worsen eczema or make an infant more likely to develop the condition, especially if there\u2019s a family history.\n\nIn her practice, Dr. Cordoro recommends that parents use a bathing method she calls \u201csoaking and sealing\u201d: soaking the infant in lukewarm water without using soap, then patting dry and applying a gentle moisturizer \u201cto seal in the moisture layer.\u201d Applying a moisturizer to infant skin daily, not just after baths, can decrease the risk of eczema developing or worsening.\n\nWhat about my older child?\n\nToddlers and preschoolers live life like it\u2019s their job to get dirty. Surely you need to bathe them every day, right? Maybe not, according to Connecticut-based pediatric dermatologist Dr. Brittany Craiglow.\n\n\u201cBathing should increase in frequency as children age, but this doesn\u2019t mean that a daily bath is always necessary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is perfectly fine to spot clean when kids get messy with paint or markers, for instance.\u201d Break out the wipes or the wet wash-cloth to clean obvious messes and diaper areas, but save the soap for days when toddlers or preschoolers do what they do best: \u201cIf they truly get dirty \u2014 such as from playing in the mud \u2014 then a bath is a better option.\u201d\n\nThere are other exceptions to the no-soap rule. \u201cKids also should have a bath after being outdoors wearing sunscreen and/or bug spray, swimming or sweating,\u201d Dr. Craiglow said. Soap should be used in these scenarios, but for routine bathing stick to using it only on feet and diaper areas, particularly if kids are prone to dry skin.\n\nWhat soaps are best?\n\nInfant care is a multi-billion dollar industry, raking in close to $17 billion annually, and skin care products make up a large percentage of overall sales, according to the market research firm Grand View Research. The glut of products on the market coupled with flashy advertising and keywords that trigger the ever-present \u201cmom-guilt\u201d make it difficult to sniff out what\u2019s actually best for your baby versus who simply has the best marketing campaign.\n\nDr. Cordoro advises parents to use the less-is-more approach when choosing grooming products for their children: \u201cIt is best to avoid or reduce fragrances, perfumes, dyes and other additives when it comes to cleansers and moisturizers, especially if your child has sensitive skin or eczema.\u201d Does that mean parents should opt for the more expensive organic products? Bear in mind that aromatics, botanicals and essential oils can trigger allergic reactions just as synthetic ingredients can. Some organic ingredients can also dry skin or worsen skin problems like eczema.\n\nIf your baby has a known skin condition, your safest bet is to consult with your pediatrician or dermatologist before choosing any topical grooming products. As with everything parenting-related, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. What works best for your baby may not be what works best for someone else\u2019s child \u2014 or even what worked best for your other children. Talk to your child\u2019s health care provider and do what works best for your baby.\n\n[Read more about how to care for your newborn, baby or toddler.]\n\nCorrection: June 25, 2019\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the type of mat used to prevent bathtub slips.
