(Picture:\n\nColeen Rooney looked particularly chirpy this morning while out on her daily morning routine, just as she took to social media to accuse fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy of selling fake stories about her, which have been denied.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who is married to footballer Wayne Rooney, was spotted out in Alderley Edge, Cheshire on Wednesday morning, running her usual errands which typically includes a workout at the gym, popping to the cash machine and grabbing a cup of coffee from Costa.\n\nBut Coleen was suspiciously happier than usual and was seen smiling cheekily while scrolling through her phone.\n\nPerhaps she was reading through comments after she admitted to setting up a plot to \u2018expose\u2019 Rebekah, 37, whom she claims has been leaking stories about her to the press.\n\nIn a message posted to her Twitter and Instagram accounts, Coleen said: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\u2019\n\nRevealing her plan of action to set the trap, Coleen continued: \u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.\n\nWonder what she could possibly be looking at (Picture: Eamonn and James Clarke\n\nColeen seemed pretty chirpy on her morning errands (Picture: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\nNo doubt her phone\u2019s been popping off today (Picture: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\n\u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\u2019\n\nColeen even claimed to have screenshots of the Instagram Stories, which reportedly showed the one person who had viewed them.\n\nShe then added: \u2018It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nColeen stepped out with her eldest son Kai (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nHowever Rebekah, wife of footballer Jamie Vardy, has denied leaking the fake stories and suggested she was hacked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRebekah, who is currently pregnant with her fourth child, said in a Twitter statement: \u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
