Biden Jr.\u2019s son, acknowledged in an interview to be broadcast on Tuesday that he probably would not have been named to the board of a foreign company if his last name weren\u2019t Biden, but he rejected suggestions by President Trump that he and his father had engaged in wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cDid I make a mistake? Maybe in the grand scheme of things,\u201d Mr. Biden said in an interview with ABC News, which published excerpts from it on Tuesday morning. \u201cBut did I make a mistake based on some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden,\u201d Mr. Biden told Amy Robach of ABC.\n\nMr. Trump has seized on the younger Mr. Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine and China to launch a series of attacks against the former vice president, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, over the past month. There is no evidence for the president\u2019s claims that Mr. Biden, while in office, improperly intervened to aid his son, but that has not stopped him and other Republicans from raising questions about possible conflicts of interest.", "description": "In an interview with ABC News, the former vice president\u2019s son rejected as \u201cridiculous\u201d President Trump\u2019s suggestions that he and his father had engaged in wrongdoing.", "authors": ["Katie Glueck", "Stephanie Saul"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/us/politics/15hunterbiden-abc/15hunterbiden-abc-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
