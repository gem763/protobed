Pumpkins walked so Unknown Singing Ghost could run. When some teenagers are subjected to a ditty of the damned listening party from a quartet of graveyard ghosts, you might assume that Chance the Rapper\u2019s spirit did not die from a lifelong addiction to sticking nine-volt batteries up his ass. (Hey, the jolts felt really good, okay?) But that would deprive you of one hell of a disturbing bop, which culminates in his quest to get the ultimate voltage strike on his roof: \u201cLike Benjamin Franklin with his key and kite / That lightening hit my pole that night / I squealed with delight but I quickly stopped / When my insides fried and my colon popped.\u201d We\u2019ll stop there, since he also shits himself. And, uh, since his penis caught on fire.\n\nRelated", "description": "Chance the Rapper\u2019s spooky SNL death song is about how he got electrocuted in the ass, and his fellow ghosts are disturbed.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/26/27-chance.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
