His No. 21-ranked Terrapins are going places.\n\nLocksley is 2-0 in just his first season as the coach brought in to clean up a troubled program. He uncorked an extended road metaphor for reporters Tuesday, likening the young season to a cross-country drive from California to the District, with stops along the way for football.\n\nMost travelers on this hypothetical journey, the coach said, would be happy after arriving in, say, Phoenix, without a flat tire, accident or other mishap.\n\nSo too is Locksley pleased, arriving at this crossroads of the season with a 2-0 record.\n\n\u201cWe are on a journey right now. We have a lot of the trip left,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next step this week is against a very good Temple program.\u201d\n\nRanked nationally for the first time since 2013, the Terrapins play the Owls on Saturday at noon in Philadelphia in a nonconference contest.\n\nLocksley said to expect the Owls to play like the city they call home \u2014 tough.\n\nThe American Athletic Conference team actually humbled the Terrapins last season in College Park, 35-14.\n\n\u201cThey beat us pretty good last year. We are definitely not taking them lightly,\u201d Maryland quarterback Josh Jackson said. \u201cI know their front seven are very good. They put their best players on the front seven.\u201d\n\nJackson completed 21 of 38 passes for 296 yards and three touchdowns in a stunning 63-20 win at home Saturday over Syracuse, which entered the game ranked No. 22. Four Maryland receivers had at least three catches: Tyler Mabry, Darryl Jones, Chigoziem Okonkwo and Dontay Demus.\n\nJackson is the first Maryland quarterback since at least 1977 to throw seven touchdowns in the first two games of the season. The Terrapins racked up 354 yards rushing against Syracuse, with 107 from Javon Leake, 94 from Damascus High product Jake Funk, and 75 from DeMatha High product Anthony McFarland.\n\nTemple comes off a bye week. The Owls won 56-12 over Bucknell at home on Aug. 31. Temple\u2019s Anthony Russo became the first Owls quarterback to record two games of at least 400 yards passing with 409 against Bucknell.\n\nMaryland had a crowd of 33,493 fans on hand for the win over Syracuse.\n\n\u201cIt was a great win for our program,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cIt was a great opportunity for us to play a ranked team here at home. I am very thankful for the student section that came out.\u201d\n\nLocksley asked his team Monday if anyone was surprised about a 2-0 start.\n\n\u201cNobody raised their hands,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe are happy with where we are on Day 2 of the journey.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
