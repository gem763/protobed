Chinese streaming service Tencent \u2014 which drew 500 million NBA viewers last year \u2014 also has said it will not be showing Rockets games this year. On Sunday, the Chinese Consulate in Houston released a statement on Morey\u2019s \u201cerroneous comments\u201d and said it had contacted the franchise.\n\n\u201cWe have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets, and urged the latter to correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nMorey has since deleted the tweet, which read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d and issued a statement on Sunday saying he did not intend for the tweet to offend. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\u201d he wrote. In the immediate aftermath of the tweet, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta attempted to assuage the tension by distancing the organization from Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nListen\u2026.@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\nThe NBA, which has taken an active business interest in promoting the league in China in recent years, responded to the situation on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,\u201d the NBA said in a statement. \u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.\u201d\n\nBrooklyn Nets owner Joseph Tsai, the co-founder of Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba, took to Facebook to voice his displeasure at Morey\u2019s comments, saying \u201csupporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues\u201d and that \u201cthe hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\nThe NBA\u2019s response has drawn bipartisan criticism, as Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) condemned the league for \u201cshamefully retreating\u201d and \u201cassisting Chinese communist censorship.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro urged the NBA to recognize that \u201cChina is using economic power to silence critics,\u201d and called for the league to \u201cnot allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) blasted the NBA\u2019s decision making. \u201cThe NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights. In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing,\u201d Sasse\u2019s statement read.", "description": "A tweet from Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, offered support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
