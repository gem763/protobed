Those individuals include Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and two associates of President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, who were arrested Thursday on campaign finance violations. The White House, Office of Management and Budget, Department of Defense, and State Department have all been subpoenaed as well.\n\nThe White House, however, said on Tuesday it would refuse to comply with requests from House Democrats.\n\nSchiff's letter confirmed that the House scheduled depositions with a former Senior Director of the National Security Council Dr. Fiona Hill, who oversaw European and Russian affairs and left her post in August. Other future testimonies include those from State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbul, and E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland.\n\nEarlier Friday, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified to House impeachment investigators that President Trump personally pressured the State Department to oust her.\n\nCNBC's Ganesh Setty contributed to this report.", "description": "The chairman of one of the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives committees leading the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump said on Friday the committee would continue and \"accelerate\" its efforts.", "authors": ["Kevin Breuninger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106150369-1569502264567rtx74kyd.jpg?v=1569846098", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
