Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\nIn a lengthy video posted on YouTube ahead of the world championships in Doha, Coleman said the charge had damaged his reputation as a clean athlete and he had foregone over $150,000 in potential earnings to fight it.\n\n\u201cI can afford a lawyer and have the best people defending me but a lot of people don\u2019t make a lot of money and if you\u2019re a lower name you might get run over by USADA,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI feel you can\u2019t put a price on the fact I have to deal with this situation ... and the smear of my reputation.\u201d\n\nThe case had been scheduled to go to arbitration but USADA withdrew the charge after receiving guidance from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on how to calculate the 12-month window for whereabouts breaches.\n\nColeman said he had forfeited over $150,000 by missing part of the European circuit to stay home and fight the charge.\n\n\u201cMy plan was to run in these two meets and then go to world championships but I had to all of a sudden, at the drop of a dime, switch up my schedule,\u201d he said.\n\nColeman, 23, claimed the silver medal in the 100 meters at the 2017 world titles in London, relegating Usain Bolt to third in the Jamaican\u2019s final solo race.\n\nColeman explained why he had racked up three whereabouts violations, each the result of different situations.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how easy it is to miss tests,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you forget to update the app, but it has nothing to do with doping or trying to dodge tests.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have a misunderstanding of how the system works. I\u2019m tested 30-40 times a year. It\u2019s a crazy amount of times. I\u2019m a human being. I forget sometimes.\u201d", "description": "Christian Coleman wants an apology from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) now that the body has dropped a whereabouts charge against him, the American sprinter said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428928694&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B07A-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
