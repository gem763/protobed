Neither is revising and rewriting U.S. history to make it seem as if the founding fathers were completely devoid of religion, faith and belief in a higher power \u2014 and that they wanted the rest of us, including the government of, by and for the people, to be that way, too.\n\nBut oh how so Democratic.\n\nIf it\u2019s not \u201cimpeach Trump,\u201d it\u2019s denying and disdaining God. Truly, Democrats don\u2019t have much to offer America at all.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
