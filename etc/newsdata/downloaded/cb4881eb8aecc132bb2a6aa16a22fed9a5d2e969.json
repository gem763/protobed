About 1000 of the cuts will hit employees such as cleaners, which WeWork is looking to move to an outsourcing company.\n\nWeWork is also looking to prioritise three markets \u2014 the US, Europe and Japan \u2014 and will pull back from other regions including China, India and much of Latin America. It has already begun looking at building closures in parts of its portfolio, including in China and other regions.\n\nThe news comes as WeWork employees and investors digested a $US9.5 billion ($14 billion) SoftBank rescue plan that helped the company avoid bankruptcy and included terms that will hand up to $US1.7 billion to Adam Neumann, the crisis-hit group\u2019s cofounder.\n\nThe SoftBank-controlled company has set a goal of boosting occupancy rates in its most important markets to about 90 per cent, the people said, compared with an occupancy that had dipped below 80 per cent as it pursued a business model more focused on global expansion.\n\nMarcelo Claure, the SoftBank executive who has been named executive chairman of the office space provider, told WeWork staff on Wednesday that the company would have to \u201cright-size\u201d its business to reach profitability and that would include job cuts.", "description": "The job cuts will amount to just under 30 per cent of WeWork\u2019s global workforce of around 14000 people, according to people with direct knowledge of its plans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2023%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/266127a0a5a6bcc826a90300577ec60eea1890ba", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
