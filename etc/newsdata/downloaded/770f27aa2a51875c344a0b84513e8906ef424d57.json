And that's not true.\"\n\nInstead, Angelina says \"you have to just do your best and be willing to put your child before you\".\n\n\"She loves being a mom, and I do too\", she added.\n\n\"It's my everything.\"\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nThe star is mother to six children: Maddox, 18, Pax 15, Zahara, 14, Shiloh, 13, and twins Vivienne and Knox, both 11.\n\nShe brought Vivienne, Zahara, Shiloh and Knox to the London premiere of the film last night.\n\nMaddox, Zahara and Pax were adopted from orphanages in Cambodia, Ethiopia and Vietman respectively. The remaining three are biological children with ex husband Brad Pitt, who she divorced in 2016 after 12 years together.\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nAngelina explained that the film holds an important lesson about being ourselves in a society that can make it hard to do so.\n\n\"You shouldn't judge people, it would be wrong to, we all have something inside of us that we feel is misunderstood, or that if we let it out completely and are completely who we are, it might not be accepted\", she said.\n\n\"But then I think, what are we doing on this earth if not to figure out what that is that makes us uniquely us, and find those who accept us for it?\"\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\n\"I hope everybody just pushes back, there's so much oppression and judgement these days. I think the only way to respond to it is to become more and more and more yourself, and shut it down.\"\n\nSpeaking about her co-stars Elle Fanning, 21 and Michelle Pfeiffer, 61, Angie called them \"amazing\" to work with.\n\n\"Elle's grown into such an extraordinary young woman, and with all her fame and everything she's gone through she is as kind and as grateful as ever\", she said.\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\n\"Michelle is brilliant, funny and wonderful. It was just a dream. It was one of those where you just got lucky at work, where everybody is really nice to each other.\"\n\nHer co-star, Brit actor Ed Skrien called Angelina \"as nice as anyone\" and \"humble\".\n\n\"She put me at ease, she's lovely. I can't wait to work with her again\", he said.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Netflix)\n\nAnother huge star in the film was Warwick Davis, who discussed how intimidating it was working with \"legendary, huge star\" Michelle.\n\n\"There's a presence about her when she walks on set, even when she's not in costume.\n\n\"And then with her queen costume on she's quite intimidating. So when I was acting scared, I wasn't really acting at all!\"\n\n\"But she's a lovely lady,\" he added.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDavid Gyasi also gushed about working with the A-list cast, and he said they had a lot of fun hanging out together on set.\n\n\"They are humble and beautiful-hearted people\", he said.\n\n\"It wasn't nerve-wracking, I just took it as an opportunity to learn and to hang out with some experienced and wonderful people.\n\n\"Their professionalism was sublime, I was really fond of both of them. They're great people.\"\n\n*Maleficent 2: Mistress of Evil comes out on 18th October", "description": "Angelina Jolie discussed parenthood and what being a good mum means - while her co stars dished the dirt on working with the Hollywood superstar", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Rex", "Getty Images For Netflix", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554784.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Maleficent-Mistress-of-Evil-European-Film-Premiere-in-London-UK-09-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
