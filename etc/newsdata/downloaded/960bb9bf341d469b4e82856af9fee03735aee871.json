I think it was sloppy language and the wrong thing to say, but I but I don\u2019t think that he is an evil man.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat isn\u2019t legitimate is to co-opt her memory or her beliefs for things that she didn\u2019t believe in or didn\u2019t say. I was thinking about how Jo would respond to it last night. She would have tried to take a generosity of spirit to it. And thought about how in this moment, you can step back from this growing inferno of rhetoric.\u201d\n\nCox urged politicians of both sides of the Brexit debate to tone down the rhetoric used and stop portraying each other as good or evil. \u201cWe just have to have a more nuanced understanding to remember our common our common humanity,\u201d Cox said.\n\nHe added:", "description": "The prime minister sparked fury yesterday when he dismissed concerns about his language when speaking about Jo Cox and Brexit as \u2018humbug\u2019", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a385a13727a3e828f265e15f6b06f52ece8c630/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5fbfe9248dd90af1a735c33d4d88e904", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
