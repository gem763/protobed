No real surprise.\n\nThe reputation as a tough sports town is certainly well-earned.\n\nEric Furda, dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, became a bit of an Internet sensation on Sunday for a GIF that emerged of him berating the referees during FOX's broadcast of the game. There may have even been some salty language involved. The Eagles 27-24 home loss to the Detroit Lions dropped their record to 1-2 on the year.\n\nThe calls during the game were repeatedly booed by the Eagles fan base.\n\nBut to learn that the face of that frustration is a high-ranking dean in one of the most prestigious institutions in the country only underscores just how deep sports runs in Philadelphia.\n\nAfter the game, Furda tweeted about the officiating.\n\nThen on Monday morning, he poked a little fun at himself and his behavior. But while Furda gave himself a penalty for \"unsportsmanlike conduct,\" it doesn\u2019t seem like any relatives from Sunday\u2019s officiating crew have a chance at getting into UPenn anytime soon.\n\nIn September\u2019s ranking of top universities by the Wall Street Journal, UPenn rose six spots to fourth in the nation.\n\nAnd the fact that there is a young child in the foreground of this video who doesn\u2019t even look dazed by what is going on around him is perhaps the most typical Philadelphia thing about this moment.", "description": "Philadelphia Eagles fan caught on television screaming (and cursing) at the officials is the dean of an Ivy League school.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP19265708192592.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
