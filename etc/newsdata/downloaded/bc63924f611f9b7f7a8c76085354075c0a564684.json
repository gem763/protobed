The team were poor with and without the ball, while defensive frailties remain a concern. England now travel to Sofia where they will face Bulgaria on Monday.\n\nCzech Republic inflict first qualifier defeat on England in 10 years Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of plaudits but we\u2019ve always maintained that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done to be a really top team,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI think tonight was clear evidence of that. We\u2019ve got to get a response and it\u2019s going to be an interesting couple of days for all of us because we haven\u2019t had a result like that, we haven\u2019t had a performance like that and we\u2019ll learn a lot more about ourselves over the next 48-72 hours. Football is all about responding to setbacks. We haven\u2019t had too many so it feels even more unpleasant because it\u2019s a while since we\u2019ve felt this way. None of us like it but that\u2019s the reality and to sail through a qualifying group with no issue is very unusual.\u201d\n\nSouthgate came under fire for his tactical approach, with his starting 4-2-3-1 system \u2013 with Mason Mount as the No 10 \u2013 leading to a first-half in which the Czechs were dominant. He switched to 4-3-3 after the interval, when England did look more cohesive.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cI always have to accept responsibility,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t look any more solid without the ball and we were poor at using the ball in the first half. I think we were better in the second half and we created chances to win the game. But we collectively have to accept the result and, as the manager, I\u2019ve got to accept that as well, absolutely.\u201d\n\nGareth Southgate\u2019s misfiring England lose control in haunting defeat | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nSouthgate was asked whether he attributed some of the defensive problems to the fact that John Stones was missing because of injury and Joe Gomez is not playing regularly at Liverpool. England looked vulnerable in central defence, where Michael Keane endured a tough night.\n\nSouthgate said he \u201ctotally understands the question\u201d and added: \u201cI think there are players who aren\u2019t playing well for their clubs but that\u2019s the situation we\u2019re in at the moment, certainly in a couple of positions. We didn\u2019t play well enough, simple as that. We conceded possession too cheaply and particularly in the first-half we didn\u2019t create enough chances. Throughout the night, we were too open.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate suggested that England\u2019s Euro 2020 hopes had been given a wake-up call after they were beaten by the Czech Republic", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4c39cd375262b46bd8023788b8c68893639447/0_123_3383_2030/master/3383.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5a52c84ff2b4b75c6f198c7173c62d74", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
