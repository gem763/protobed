Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, is Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nCorreia, 44, was to make an initial appearance later Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan. There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment from Correia's lawyer.\n\nProsecutors said Correia, an American-born businessman who owns a home with his wife in West Palm Beach, was part of efforts by co-defendants Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to leverage outsized political donations to advance their business interests.\n\nBoth Parnas and Fruman \u2014 U.S. citizens who were born in Ukraine and Belarus, respectively \u2014 have a history of business dealings with Giuliani.\n\nThe pair made campaign contributions with the intent of lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the country's ambassador to Ukraine. At the time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump's potential Democratic challenger Joe Biden.\n\nGiuliani has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations and hadn't seen any evidence that Parnas and Fruman did anything wrong.\n\nCorreia is accused in a separate scheme of conspiring with the other defendants, including Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen Andrey Kukushkin, to make political donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states with the aim of trying to get support for a new recreational marijuana business.\n\nCorreia is listed as the registered agent for a Florida corporation tied to a series of wire transfers that prosecutors allege was part of an elaborate effort to hide the true source of funds used to make the donations.\n\nHe posed with then-Rep. Pete Sessions in a 2018 photo taken inside the Texas Republican's Capitol Hill office that Parnas posted on social media with the caption \"Hard at work !!\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported last week that Sessions fits the description in the indictment of a congressman who prosecutors allege was part of a coordinated effort to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nAt least some of the defendants are expected to appear in court Thursday for an arraignment.\n\n___\n\nMichael Biesecker reported from Washington.", "description": "A Florida man wanted in a campaign finance case involving associates of Rudy Giuliani is in federal custody after flying Wednesday to Kennedy Airport in New York City to turn himself in, federal authorities said.
