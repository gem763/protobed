The scheme provides insurance for the poorest 100 million families of the country. Prime Minister Modi arrived at Vigyan Bhavan at the designated time, but instead of entering the main hall to make his address, he stopped outside at a makeshift meeting hall. He then spent half an hour interacting with about 30 people who had availed the scheme over the past year. I was delighted to see this \u2013 direct interaction between the PM and the users of the scheme sends a powerful message through the ranks.\n\nMy joy was short-lived. I heard the discussion being referred to as \u201can interaction with beneficiaries\u201d. I noticed that the designated seats in the auditorium for the group of 30 were marked \u201cReserved for Beneficiaries\u201d. When the PM addressed the gathering, he repeatedly used the Hindi word for Beneficiaries, Labharthi, to refer to the users of the insurance scheme. Why am I harping on the use of one word?\n\nBecause it changes everything.\n\nBeneficiary is not a mere word, it\u2019s a mindset that permeates governments and many NGOs. What image does the word beneficiary evoke? Foremost, it necessarily implies a benefactor. The generous one. As a benefactor, one is so delighted with the noble act itself that thoughts of doing it with any rigour are secondary. Moreover, beneficiaries do not ask questions of their benefactor. They are supposed to take what they get. I like to imagine the State, as the benefactor, standing on a pedestal, and the beneficiary with folded hands, sitting patiently on his haunches.\n\nWhen the word is used at the top, the lowest state functionary carries the same attitude. Let me elaborate with a few examples to highlight the contrast between a customer and a beneficiary mindset. You provide customers comfortable waiting areas designed by human centred design experts, while beneficiaries huddle on the floor before meeting the doctor. You win over customers with 21 st century marketing. What does \u201cDaag Acche Hain\u201d (\u201cstains are good\u201d) have to do with a detergent commercial? Everything, the modern-day marketer will tell you, because you are celebrating childhood to evoke certain emotions among parents to drive them to purchase that brand. On the other hand, you attempt to win over beneficiaries by giving them poorly formatted leaflets and unbearable jingles that tell them rather casually to make drastic changes to their lifestyles. You design great products taking the customer\u2019s inputs; sometimes you even co-design with them. On the other, you shove your \u201cdesigned in a fancy conference room\u201d product down the beneficiaries\u2019 throats. The list could go on. At the heart of it is this belief: the poor do not know what they want or need.\n\nOn the contrary, many of the poor do, in fact, exercise choice and vote with their feet when they see a bad product or service. India\u2019s primary (and sometimes) secondary health facilities see underutilization, while neighbouring quacks thrive. Enrolment into public schools is falling while the share of private has been steadily rising. Parents are paying an arm and a leg to put their children through private schools, often with poorer quality but superior customer experience. Many private start-ups and corporates are providing marginal farmers with just in time information for a nominal charge, while the same information is available with government extension workers for free. There are many things at play here, but not having in a customer mindset is at the front and centre of it.\n\nOccasionally, governments and NGOs stumble upon improving the \u201cbeneficiary experience\u201d in a piecemeal manner. Hence, you have a large international Management Consulting firm designed patient flow process at AIIMS, India\u2019s premier public hospital. You have a well-designed media campaign for Swachh Bharat. These are isolated examples, few and far in between. When you believe that the poor are your customers, these become the norm, not the exceptions.\n\nIt\u2019s time that the government and NGOs do away with the use of the word, Beneficiary and replace it with Customer. Perhaps, the PM could lead the change? If he does, that squat will turn into an upright stance, the folded hands will melt away to the sides, and the infinite wisdom of the customer will flow into our programs and policies.", "description": "Earlier this week, I was invited to an event marking the 1 st year anniversary of Ayushman Bharat, India\u2019s flagship health care program.
