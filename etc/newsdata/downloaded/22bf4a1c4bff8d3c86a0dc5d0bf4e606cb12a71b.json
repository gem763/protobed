The song \u201chas given people hope.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCalma\u201d has become a global hit, appearing on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping several countries\u2019 charts. It has been played on El Zol 2,531 times (and counting) since Oct. 30, 2018. And now it\u2019s being used as a specific kind of anthem: the unofficial celebration song for the Washington Nationals baseball team.\n\nAD\n\nOverjoyed Nats players have celebrated their recent big postseason wins by spraying beer and champagne while singing and dancing to the tune. Videos of the festivities have gone viral online (boosted at first by Washington City Paper reporter Kelyn Soong). At the center of several of them: second baseman Brian Dozier, a white man with a Mississippi accent, who often offers a slight twerk as he recites the Spanish lyrics.\n\nProbably the best video I\u2019ve ever take pic.twitter.com/TSyrgphebj \u2014 Kelyn Soong (@KelynSoong) September 25, 2019\n\nDozier decided to learn Spanish after he saw how much his best friend and former teammate, Eduardo Escobar of Venezuela, struggled with English. \u201cA way for me to learn more Spanish and interact is through music, Spanish songs,\u201d Dozier said. \u201cWe have some Latinos obviously on the team, and so they let me know the number ones out and stuff, the best songs to dance to listen to. And so I just go and try to learn it, and you learn words through that way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPitcher An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez introduced Dozier to \u201cCalma\u201d during a plane ride, and throughout the year, Nationals players have posted videos on their Instagram stories that show Dozier cutting loose and singing along to it at parties and while traveling.\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cCalma\u201d and reggaeton postgame celebrations started with players like outfielder Gerardo Parra, who controls the clubhouse playlist, infielder Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera and Dozier. \u201cThe Latino players brought that energy, and we liked it and kept doing it,\u201d center fielder Victor Robles said in Spanish. Now the team has a routine, playing \u201cCalma\u201d whenever they win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a type of music, you know, of a lot of movement,\u201d Robles added. \u201cThat\u2019s why we like to listen to reggaeton, because it energizes us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe reggaeton song allows you to dance and have a good time, pitcher Roenis El\u00edas said in Spanish. \u201cEven non-Latinos are now dancing and enjoying it. Since they see we like it, I think they feel the same way. \u2026 We\u2019re a family, and we\u2019re all trying to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nPlayers who can\u2019t sing along with Farruko and Cap\u00f3 appreciate the party vibe. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re saying, but I love the energy, and it gets everybody in the clubhouse going, gets everybody dancing,\u201d pitcher Sean Doolittle said. \u201cI think we\u2019re lucky to have guys like Parra, An\u00edbal [Sanchez], Fernando [Rodney], these guys that have come here and changed the culture in the clubhouse and got a lot of guys in here to kind of loosen up and play the game with a little bit more fun, to be honest.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVideos showing players of many backgrounds \u2014 Dominican, Venezuelan, Cuban, North American \u2014 partying to the track have become so popular that the Nationals\u2019 official social media accounts have been posting \u201cCalma\u201d-related content. A photo of a \u201cCalma\u201d celebration graced the front page of The Washington Post\u2019s sports section after the team clinched a spot in the World Series, which starts Tuesday night. Cap\u00f3 has been enthusiastically tweeting about the team, as well.\n\nAD\n\nThe popularity and vibe of the song, Cintron said, \u201cranks up with there with \u2018Despacito,\u2019 \u201d the popular track by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee that became a worldwide sensation in 2017 after Justin Bieber jumped on a remix. But whereas the viral video of Dozier singing \u201cCalma\u201d in a clubhouse shows off his linguistic prowess, the viral video of Bieber singing \u2018Despacito\u2019 in a club doesn\u2019t demonstrate a similar command of Spanish. \u201cI don\u2019t know the words, so I say 'Dorito,\u201d Bieber sings, then adds, \u201cAbba Abba Abba.\u201d\n\nDozier used to dance a lot with Escobar when they both played for the Minnesota Twins (their signature handshake was a dance). \u201cI just think it\u2019s something for an American to dance to Latin songs, just because a lot of people don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re saying,\u201d Dozier said. \u201cReggaeton is a very, I guess, flowing-and-moving-of-the-hips type of genre.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn some ways, \u201cCalma\u201d serves as an odd choice for a postgame celebration song. It doesn\u2019t have a hard-core, intense beat. But its laid-back vibe and slow energy provide a nice release valve for the pressure built up over needing a win. \u201cVamos pa\u2019 la playa,\u201d goes the chorus, \u201cPa\u2019 curarte el alma.\u201d (\u201cLet\u2019s go to the beach, to cure your soul.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor the Washington Nationals, they\u2019re having a good time while they\u2019re playing, and they\u2019re definitely taking the song to heart, because it\u2019s like, easy does it,\u201d Cintron said.\n\nThe original \u201cCalma\u201d remix (Alicia Keys has one, too) turned into Cap\u00f3\u2019s first Billboard Hot 100 hit, peaking at No. 71 in May, and the music video has amassed 1.6 billion YouTube views. On El Zol, \u201cCalma\u201d became especially popular in January. \u201cSomehow it spoke to our people, our listeners. I guess it just makes them feel a little warmer,\u201d Cintron said. Now it\u2019s played no fewer than five times a day. \u201cIt\u2019s a song that, a year later, I cannot take off from my playlist.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCap\u00f3 explained that nostalgia helped inspire the song. \u201cWe were trying to re-create this familiar scene [in Puerto Rico] where we go to the beach, disconnect and be present,\u201d Cap\u00f3 told Billboard in June. After the singer released the original version, reggaeton artist Farruko direct-messaged the singer on Instagram, telling Cap\u00f3 how much he connected with the song as a fellow Puerto Rican.\n\nAD\n\nIn the remix, Farruko references \u201cDespacito\u201d and raps about beach-hopping and the warmth of the Puerto Rican sun. \u201cWhat he put in the song was his true feelings,\u201d Cap\u00f3 said. \u201cI feel that his honesty and the way that he opened up, almost vulnerable, and connected with the song has a lot to do with [its success].\"\n\nCintron, who hails from Puerto Rico, first heard \u201cCalma\u201d during a trip there last year. Since then, she witnessed hundreds of thousands of fans at a massive music festival in Chile \u2014 \u201ca world away\u201d from Puerto Rico \u2014 join Cap\u00f3 in singing a joyful song about her home island.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a lot with Maria: not being able to get in touch with your family or your cousins for three weeks, and all we could do is run around and get water and all these different things to send to Puerto Rico,\u201d Cintron said, holding back tears. And now, \u201cto see the Nationals bring another life to the song, it\u2019s pretty emotional for me.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Pedro Cap\u00f3 and Farruko song is an ode to having a good time, the song of hope for Puerto Rico and now the soundtrack to the Washington Nationals' World Series run.", "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OrzA5tT2UGUm7Hm2U3VopX0iSRw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIYLLRXPZUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
