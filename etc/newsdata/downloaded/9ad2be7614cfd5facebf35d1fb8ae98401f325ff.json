It's unclear yet who they are or how long they had been buried.\n\n\"The Attorney General's Office, which has been joining the collective of women searching, recovered the remains for transportation and their eventual analysis that will allow for the identification of these deceased persons,\" the state agency said in a statement.\n\nBotched raid: Attempt to arrest El Chapo's son led to massive firefight in Mexico\n\nAt least one of the bodies was still in a stage of decomposition, meaning it was buried recently. The remaining 12 bodies were largely skeletal remains, indicating they had been there for a longer period of time. At least two of them could be women, the state added.\n\nThe group has not responded to requests for comment on the discovery. But a post on their Facebook page from Wednesday alluded to the discovery of the mass grave in Rocky Point on that day.\n\nA second post from Thursday showed pictures of the women and forensic workers digging up the grave in the middle of a remote desert area, surrounded by Mexican Federal Police officers and National Guard troops.\n\nThe Searching Mothers of Sonora describe themselves as \"mothers searching for missing persons or human remains, to bring peace to other families that are going through the same pain,\" according to their Facebook page.\n\n\"We are not looking for the perpetrators, we just want back what was taken from us one day,\" their description said.\n\nA group of women and Sonora investigators dig up a mass grave with 13 bodies near Rocky Point on Oct. 24, 2019, as federal police and National Guard soldiers look on.

The city was the scene of especially heavy fighting among criminal groups and the Mexican military in the early 2010's.\n\nRecently, the Sonoran state government, with the help of Arizona officials, has invested greatly in improving safety in and around the beach resort town, as well as the main highway from Arizona leading to the city.\n\nThe city is a key source of tourism revenue for the state, but an increasing number of visitors come from Arizona, making it a priority for both states.\n\nFollow Rafael Carranza on Twitter: @RafaelCarranza.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/25/mass-grave-mexican-mothers-rocky-point-sonora/2460430001/", "description": "Searching Mothers of Sonora uncovered a mass grave with the remains of 13 people inside, located near the popular beach resort town of Puerto Pe\u00f1asco.", "authors": ["Rafael Carranza", "Published P.M.
