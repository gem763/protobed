It also reveals new details about the rape allegation that ended Matt Lauer\u2019s career at NBC, according to Variety. In 2017, former NBC employee Brooke Nevils came forward with a complaint against Lauer, but the specifics of the allegation were kept private, until now.\n\nIn the book, through interviews with Farrow, Nevils claims that Lauer anally raped her in a hotel room while at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. She describes going out for drinks with another co-worker, running into Lauer, and going to his hotel room twice (first, to take back her press credential, which Lauer took as a joke and second on invitation from Lauer), and being \u201ctoo drunk to consent.\u201d Farrow writes that Nevils had \u201cno reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.\u201d Instead, according to Nevils\u2019 account, Lauer began \u201cflipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex\u201d and penetrating her anally despite Nevils repeatedly refusing. \u201cLauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cThe encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u2018It hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u2019 She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d When he asked, Nevils told Lauer she liked it. She says she bled \u201cfor days\u201d afterward.\n\nBack in New York, Nevils and Lauer began a sexual relationship that she described as \u201ccompletely transactional.\u201d When it ended, Nevils told \u201clike a million people\u201d about the relationship, including her bosses and co-workers at NBC. Nothing happened, Nevils says, until the Me Too movement set off bells for her colleagues. Even after Lauer was fired, tensions in the office and allegiances to the anchor made her life \u201ctorture.\u201d Eventually, she was placed on medical leave and paid \u201cseven figures\u201d by the company, according to Farrow. The journalist also claims NBC News president Noah Oppenheim obstructed him from looking into Harvey Weinstein. The pushback led him to take his story to the New Yorker. NBC told Variety that it plans to defend any of the company\u2019s decisions in Farrow\u2019s book, after they read it. Catch and Kill comes out on October 15.", "description": "Journalist Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book, \u2018Catch and Kill,\u2019 exposes details about the investigation into Harvey Weinstein and the story behind Matt Lauer\u2019s rape allegation.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/09/09-matt-lauer.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
