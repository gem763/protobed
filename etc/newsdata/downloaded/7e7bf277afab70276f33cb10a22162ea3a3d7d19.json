That was a bad omen for Atlanta starter Mike Foltynewicz, who didn\u2019t walk a single batter in seven innings during his winning start in Game 2.\n\nMike Foltynewicz was removed in the first inning.

The Cardinals put their first run on the board when Marcell Ozuna, who came into the game batting .471 for the series, singled.\n\nThe Braves could have limited the damage there, but they didn\u2019t. First baseman Freddie Freeman booted a potential double-play ground ball from Yadier Molina that loaded the bases.\n\nThen Foltynewicz walked Matt Carpenter for the Cardinals\u2019 second run. He was pulled one batter later when Tommy Edman smoked a double down the right-field line to make it 4-0 in favor of Max Fried, who immediately came into the game and walked Cardinals pitcher Jack Flaherty.\n\nThe avalanche happened quickly from there as Fowler and Kolten Wong hit back-to-back doubles, taking the lead from 5-0 to 9-0.\n\nThen, in the ultimate indignity, the Cardinals scored their 10th run when Ozuna swung at a third strike that got away from McCann, scoring Wong on the wild pitch. Ozuna ended up at first as McCann\u2019s throw missed the bag by several feet.", "description": "The Cardinals scored 10 runs in the top of the first in the winner-take-all Game 5, the most first-inning runs in postseason history.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
