Lauren Joy Fleishman\n\nBut the dresses were evidently special, and requests began pouring in. \u201cThe demand for the dresses just keeps growing and we are frantically running to keep up with the expansion of the brand,\u201d she says.\n\nTypically, a designer in her position would team up with a luxury fashion conglomerate or, at the very least, a deep-pocketed investor. But Cave says she has no interest in such a move. She still designs everything herself, in her modest atelier in the seaside town of Brighton. The Vampire\u2019s Wife does not hold runway shows and Cave simply releases new collections when they are ready (her latest came out in August).\n\nMy dresses feel like ghost-like memories and fever-dreams that re-connect me to the world. \u2014 Susie Cave\n\n\u201cOur strategy is to remain authentic and real and to work at my own pace,\u201d she says. \u201cUltimately, I need to love my work, and the way to do that is to stay intimately connected to the dresses and the designs by doing small production runs.\u201d\n\nFor Cave, this approach is about more than creative fulfilment: in July 2015, just as The Vampire\u2019s Wife was taking flight, her 15-year-old son Arthur died in a fall from a cliff in Brighton.\n\nNow, she says, \u201cwork is simply a matter of survival. It has literally saved my life. It has momentum and flow, and it feels like I am creating a parallel universe that exists beyond the trauma of the loss of my son. To sit and dream and design a dress and to watch it grow into something is a source of great joy for me.\u201d\n\n\"Our strategy is to remain authentic,\" says Cave of the label's small production runs.\n\nShe adds: \u201cMy dresses feel like ghost-like memories and fever-dreams that reconnect me to the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the wake of Arthur\u2019s death, Susie, Nick and their surviving son, Earl, contemplated leaving Brighton. But, for now, they remain. \u201cBrighton will always feel like home,\u201d Cave explains. \u201cIt is so beautiful \u2013 all that lovely late-afternoon coral-coloured light and the sparkling sea. But it is a town full of sadness for me and sometimes I need to get away. We tend to head to LA \u2013 a very different kind of place.\u201d\n\nCave also spends time on the road with her husband, who has played some of the best-received concerts of his career in recent years and has just released a two-part album, Ghosteen, an achingly beautiful meditation on loss and survival. \u201cThe songs on the first album are the children. The songs on the second album are the parents. Ghosteen is a migrating spirit,\u201d he writes on his website.\n\nThe cover for Nick Cave's new album, available digitally now and out on vinyl and CD on November 8. VMPR\n\n\u201cThese are probably the most painful songs Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds have ever recorded,\u201d the British music website NME wrote, \u201cbut they\u2019re also the most beautiful: it is a work of extraordinary, unsettling scope.\u201d\n\nTogether, the couple makes plans for the fashion label\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cMy husband is very involved,\u201d Cave says. \u201cYou know, he just loves clothes \u2013 especially women\u2019s clothes. He has an intuitive understanding of what looks good on a woman, so I run a lot of designs by him.\n\n\u201cHe acts as a kind of beauty barometer. He is at his happiest flicking through a swatch of fabric.\u201d\n\nNEED TO KNOW\n\nThe new collection is available at Brown\u2019s, Net-A-Porter and from thevampireswife.com", "description": "Susie Cave reflects on the runaway success of The Vampire\u2019s Wife fashion label, the brand she founded in 2014 \u201cto make some dresses for my friends\u201d.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2147%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_70%2C$y_228/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0bff68a8d33b8223006c2c252438a86a1534d2ac", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
