Scottish nationalists to seek 2nd referendum on independence from the UK \u2018within weeks\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "With a UK general election looming large, the Scottish Nationalist Party has pledged to fight the campaign on the basis of the need to give the Scots another chance to vote for independence, possibly as soon as next year.\n\nAn election has yet to be triggered but political machinations mean it is a matter of \u2018when\u2019 Brits will be going to the polls rather than \u2018if\u2019. And, when the starting gun is finally fired, the SNP wants the Scottish electorate to know that they\u2019re redoubling their efforts to fight the election on an independence footing.\n\nSpeaking at the party\u2019s conference in Aberdeen on Sunday, the SNP\u2019s House of Commons leader, Ian Blackford, said that a general election is the only solution to years of \u201cBrexit chaos.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Independence is coming\u2019: Thousands march through Edinburgh in support of Scottish independence\n\nBlackford cited polls showing an uptick in support for Scottish independence and a similar increase in support for another referendum on the matter.\n\n\u201cThose same polls show that a majority of people across the UK, not just Scotland, believe that we have the right to decide our own future,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut if the Tories are so scared of putting Scotland\u2019s future into the hands of Scotland\u2019s people, if they are determined to prevent us taking that democratic step \u2013 then the right to decide Scotland\u2019s future will be at the heart of the next election campaign,\u201d he added.\n\nBlackford also told Sky News that the vote should take place next year. \u201cWe\u2019re putting legislation through the Scottish parliament now, that will enable [a second independence referendum] to take place\u2026 That referendum should take place in 2020,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso on rt.com With Boris Johnson steering Brexit towards disaster capitalism, Scottish indy is a lifeboat\n\nThe rallying speech comes the same day as SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said that she will request another independence referendum from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in \u201ca matter of weeks.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Sturgeon outlined plans to formally ask the British government for another section 30 order of the Scotland Act 1998 which, if granted, would pave the way for \u201cindyref2\u201d.\n\nIndependence from the United Kingdom was rejected by Scottish voters in a 2014 referendum. However, that result came before the UK voted to leave the European Union. Scotland voted overwhelmingly against Brexit and many feel that the UK leaving the bloc warrants a rerun of the independence vote.\n\nLike this story?
