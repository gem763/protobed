At one point it will travel more than the width of the full Moon within a minute and it will get as bright as the stars in the Little Dipper. But it won\u2019t be a satellite or an airplane\u2014it will be a 340-meter-wide near-Earth asteroid called 99942 Apophis that will cruise harmlessly by Earth, about 19,000 miles (31,000 km) above the surface. That\u2019s within the distance that some of our spacecraft that orbit Earth. \u2018It\u2019s rare for an asteroid of this size to pass by the Earth so close. Although scientists have spotted small asteroids, on the order of 5-10 meters, flying by Earth at a similar distance, asteroids the size of Apophis are far fewer in number and so do not pass this close to Earth as often. \u2018The asteroid, looking like a moving star-like point of light, will first become visible to the naked eye in the night sky over the southern hemisphere, flying above Earth from the east coast to the west coast of Australia. It will be mid-morning on the East Coast of the United States when Apophis is above Australia. It will then cross the Indian Ocean, and by the afternoon in the eastern US it will have crossed the equator, still moving west, above Africa. At closest approach, just before 6 p.m. EDT, Apophis will be over the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 and it will move so fast that it will cross the Atlantic in just an hour. By 7 p.m. EDT, the asteroid will have crossed over the United States.\u2019\n\nSeveral views of Apophis released in 2013 (Image: Nasa)\n\nIn 2013, Nasa calculated that Apophis would not hit Earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We have effectively ruled out the possibility of an Earth impact by Apophis in 2036,\u2019 said Don Yeomans, manager of NASA\u2019s Near-Earth Object Program Office at JPL.\n\n\u2018The impact odds as they stand now are less than one in a million, which makes us comfortable saying we can effectively rule out an Earth impact in 2036. Our interest in asteroid Apophis will essentially be for its scientific interest for the foreseeable future.\u2019\n\nHowever, it said the \u2018April 13, 2029, flyby of asteroid Apophis will be one for the record books\u2019 because of how close the object will come to our planet.\n\n\u2018The Apophis close approach in 2029 will be an incredible opportunity for science,\u2019 said Marina Brozovi\u0107, a radar scientist at Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\n\\\u2019We\u2019ll observe the asteroid with both optical and radar telescopes. With radar observations, we might be able to see surface details that are only a few meters in size.\u2019", "description": "We're due for close encounters with more than a dozen space rocks this week.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PRI_78479991_1570490629.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
