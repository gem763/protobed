More iPads are sold than any other company\u2019s entire laptop lineup! The new iPad Pro with an eight-core A12X processor is faster than 92 percent of portable PCs sold today! The graphics performance is 1000 times faster than the first-generation iPad and now rivals an Xbox One S! It has a USB-C port that can drive 5K displays!\n\nAll of this data was used to support equally spectacular claims about what an iPad really is. It is a \u201cmagical piece of glass that can be anything you need it to be,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said, adding that all that power is \u201cgoing to push what you can do on iPad, or on any computer, even further.\u201d The overwhelming message was the iPad is more powerful, more capable, and more the future than any laptop \u2014 Apple\u2019s own new MacBook Air included.\n\nBut computers are about more than just sales and processor specs: they\u2019re about software. And the one thing Apple didn\u2019t really change on the iPad Pro is iOS 12, which has all of the same capabilities and limitations iPad users have come to expect. Apple wants you to think that the iPad Pro is the future of computing, but if you\u2019ve already used iOS 12 on an iPad Pro, you know exactly how you feel about that idea.\n\nApple gave me a completely maxed-out 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 1TB of storage, LTE, and the optional $199 Smart Keyboard Folio and $129 Apple Pencil to review. That makes for $2,227 of iPad Pro \u2014 more than all but one standard MacBook Pro configuration. It is impossible to look at a device this powerful and expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop for day-to-day work.\n\nIt\u2019s also impossible to look at the iPad Pro and not be struck by its design. This is the first truly new Apple mobile hardware design in a long while, and it has a deeper connection to the MacBook Pro than the iPhone or previous iPads. Instead of rounded corners and soft shapes, the iPad Pro is all hard corners and flat sides, with massive, asymmetrical antenna lines on the back and a huge camera bump. Most people I showed our space gray review unit to thought it looked cool, but I think it\u2019s kind of brutal looking \u2014 almost like a reference design.\n\nIt is impossible to look at a device this expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop\n\nThose squared off edges and smaller bezels change the screen-to-body ratio in positive ways: the 11-inch model fits a larger screen in the same size body as the old 10.5-inch model, and the 12.9-inch model shrinks the body down to fit the screen, making it much less clumsy to use than the outgoing model.\n\nApple keeps saying the iPad Pro now has an \u201call screen design\u201d that \u201cgoes from edge to edge,\u201d but let\u2019s just be honest: nothing about these bezels is edge-to-edge. It is, however, an extremely nice 264ppi LCD screen, and I continue to be a fan of Apple\u2019s fancy technique to round off the corners of LCDs.\n\nApart from the corners, the new iPad Pro display is substantially the same as last year\u2019s Pro, with Apple\u2019s extremely smooth 120Hz ProMotion variable refresh rate system, True Tone automatic color calibration, and wide color support. This is one of the best, most accurate mobile displays you can look at.\n\nOf course, expanding the display means there\u2019s no home button or TouchID sensor. Instead, the iPad Pro has the same TrueDepth camera and Face ID system as the iPhone XS, with a 7-megapixel camera, infrared projector, and IR camera. The big change is that it now works in any orientation, so you can pick up and unlock the iPad any way you want.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on when you swipe up\n\nThere are some neat affordances to handle that flexibility: if you hold the iPad in landscape and cover the camera with your hand, it\u2019ll tell you, with an arrow pointing to the camera on the lock screen so you can uncover it. If you have the camera at the bottom, the lock screen will instruct you to look down so FaceI D can properly see your face. And if you have the keyboard cover on, you can double-tap the spacebar to quickly unlock with Face ID, which is very fast \u2014 and very reminiscent of Windows Hello. If only Apple put this system on its laptops, too.\n\nThe lack of a home button also means that you now navigate the iPad Pro using the same gestures as the iPhone: you can tap on the screen to wake, swipe up to go home, and swipe up a bit more to open the app switcher, and swipe along the bottom to switch between apps. The iPad version of iOS also has a dock, so you can swipe up just a little in an app to bring it up, which is how you slide a second app onto the screen, or quickly pop an app over your workspace to get something done.\n\nThese new gestures are all intuitive to pick up, especially if you\u2019ve been using a recent iPhone, but there\u2019s a lot going on when you swipe up \u2014 it definitely took me a second to figure out how to get the dock to appear instead of going home or opening up the app switcher.\n\nThe significant camera bump on the back houses an f/1.8 lens and a 12-megapixel sensor. Apple says this is an all-new camera that matches the performance of the old iPad Pro in a much thinner package so it can fit behind the display. You do get the benefit of Apple\u2019s Smart HDR processing, so you\u2019ll see flatter images with more detail in the shadows than before, but the images are not quite as good as the iPhone XS wide-angle camera.\n\nThe back of the iPad is also where you\u2019ll find the smart connector for keyboards. Apple\u2019s new Smart Keyboard case has the same keys and feel as the old model, but the folding design is all new. On the plus side, it protects both sides now, and it\u2019s much simpler and cleaner looking: that weird hump is gone, and there\u2019s no more origami folding required. But it\u2019s also less flexible: if you just want to open it up and use the iPad as a tablet, you have to flip the keyboard all the way around, where you\u2019ll feel the keys on the back. And there are only two angles when it\u2019s open, while both the Surface Pro and Google Pixel slate offer near-infinite adjustments. I\u2019d bet third parties like Logitech offer much nicer keyboard covers in the future, just like they did with the older iPad Pro.\n\nI gave the new Apple Pencil to Verge tech reporter Dami Lee, who is also a published cartoonist, and she thought the new magnetic charging system was a huge improvement over the clunky Lightning jack design of the previous pencil. But she was less impressed with the double-tap-to-switch-tools touch control on the side, which she found a little awkward. \u201cIt\u2019s just not as natural as having a button on the side,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat you will not find anywhere is a headphone jack, which is a curious omission since so many iPads are used essentially as televisions, and so many pro media workflows demand low-latency audio monitoring. Apple put AirPods in the reviewer package, so the company isn\u2019t being entirely shy about how it expects iPad Pro customers to solve this problem. (That\u2019s now a total of $2,356 for this iPad, in case you\u2019re keeping track.)\n\nThere are four sets of speakers \u2014 a tweeter and woofer in each corner \u2014 five microphones, and the new USB-C connector around the sides. Like everything about the new iPad Pro, that USB-C connector is both remarkably powerful and incredibly frustrating.\n\nWith one huge exception, most normal stuff you\u2019d plug into a USB-C port works without fuss, and a bunch of other things work if you have an app that supports it. I tried a handful of USB-C hubs with an assortment of USB-A, HDMI, card readers, and Ethernet ports, and everything worked as intended. An extremely corporate Dell USB-C hub even let me plug an external display into the iPad over VGA, which was truly a vision of the future.\n\nExternal displays work just like the old Lightning-to-HDMI adapter: the system will simply mirror the iPad Pro by default, but apps that support an extended screen can do different things. Keynote will use the external display as the presentation monitor and show you the next slide on the iPad, for example. Djay will show visualizers on the second screen. But most apps don\u2019t do anything except mirror, so don\u2019t get too excited about your crazy multiple-monitor iPad Pro rig just yet. All of this is exactly the same as the older iPad Pro, which supported external displays using a Lighting-to-HDMI dongle. The only real changes are that the new Pro can support up to 5K displays, and run a display simultaneously with other USB-C devices.\n\nKeyboards worked. A USB microphone showed up in GarageBand. You can plug a phone or Nintendo Switch into it and get up to 7.5 watts of power to charge them. (That\u2019s not really enough for a Switch, by the way.) Apple supports both analog and digital audio out, so virtually all USB-C headphones and audio dongles work, a huge improvement over the Android ecosystem.\n\nThis $1,899 tablet simply won\u2019t talk to a flash drive\n\nOther stuff didn\u2019t work, though: printers didn\u2019t do anything. A Native Instruments Maschine mk3 audio controller sat in silence. A Beyerdynamic USB-C microphone only worked when we used an A-to-C cable plugged into a hub. USB-C is still kind of messy and weird, so you\u2019ll just have to try things and see what works for you.\n\nBut one extremely important category of devices will definitely not work: iOS does not support external storage. You can plug as many flash drives or hard drives as you want into the iPad Pro\u2019s USB-C port, and nothing will happen. Apple says third parties can write apps to talk to external storage, but out of the box, this $1,899 tablet simply won\u2019t talk to a flash drive.\n\nThe one thing iOS can do with external storage devices is import photos: if you plug in a camera or a memory card from a camera, iOS 12 will automatically pop open the camera import screen and let you import photos into your camera roll.\n\nThat\u2019s it. That is the sole way iOS 12 can address external storage. And to make matters worse, you are required to import to the system camera roll \u2014 you can\u2019t import photos directly into an app like Lightroom CC. Apple has to be in the middle.\n\nI use Lightroom CC all the time, and I would love to manage and edit all my photos on an iPad Pro, especially since editing with the Apple Pencil is so much fun on this display. But I have no desire to import hundreds of RAW files into my camera roll and iCloud photos account. When I brought this up, Apple very proudly pointed to a new Siri Shortcut from Adobe that imports photos from the camera roll into Lightroom and then automatically deletes them from the camera roll.\n\nEither you understand iOS so well you can get around its limitations, or you give up and use a real computer\n\nI couldn\u2019t test that Lightroom Siri Shortcut, since it\u2019s not yet available. But I can tell you that macro-based hacks around the limitations of an operating system are not usually included in bold visions of the future of computing, and that Siri Shortcut is a pure hack around the limitations Apple has imposed on the iPad Pro.\n\nOh, but it gets worse. I shoot photos in JPG+RAW, and the iOS PhotoKit API only allows apps to grab one or the other from the camera roll. So I could only import my RAW images into Lightroom, leaving the JPGs behind to clutter up my camera roll and iCloud storage. That\u2019s untenable, so I just gave up and imported everything directly into Lightroom using my Mac, because my Mac doesn\u2019t insist on abstracting the filesystem away into nonsense.\n\nThis little Lightroom vignette is basically the story of the iPad Pro: either you have to understand the limitations of iOS so well you can make use of these little hacks all over the place to get things done, or you just deal with it and accept that you have to go back to a real computer from time to time because it\u2019s just easier. And in that case, you might as well just use a real computer.\n\nThese roadblocks are made all the more heartbreaking by the A12X processor, which appears to be absolutely lightning-fast. Nothing is ever slow, and it always feels like there\u2019s more headroom to work with. We have an early build of Photoshop for iPad, which is coming next year, and it handled a file with tons of layers just fine. Games were super-smooth, although no iOS games really offer Xbox One-quality graphics. We were able to import several minutes of 4K footage into Adobe Premiere Rush, edit them, and export without breaking a sweat. We were not, however, able to export that footage in 4K, because Premiere Rush is yet another disappointingly limited iPad version of an app, and only exports in 1080p.\n\nThere is no way to watch YouTube in 4K on the iPad Pro\n\nI would love to use all the power offered by the A12X, but the iPad app ecosystem is still full of cut-down apps, limited feature sets, and compromises. Yes, this new iPad Pro benchmarks faster than my daily-driver 2015 MacBook Pro, but Safari on the iPad simply isn\u2019t a desktop-class browser, so desktop websites often kick me out to mobile apps that don\u2019t have the features I need either. Microsoft Excel for iPad still doesn\u2019t support macros. If you want to write an iPad app, you have to use\u2026 a Mac.\n\nAnd, most irritatingly, Apple refuses to support Google\u2019s VP9 video codec, so there is literally no way to watch YouTube in 4K on the iPad Pro. You just can\u2019t do it.\n\nI can see any number of ways for me to get rid of my laptop and use the iPad Pro as my main computer \u2014 using an iPad is extremely pleasant, and it\u2019s nice to use a computer with a touchscreen. But over and over again, some annoying iOS limitation stopped me from making the switch. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m just stuck in some old way of thinking or that I need to spend more time inventing a new workflow out of Siri Shortcuts and glue. It\u2019s just basic stuff, like plugging in a flash drive to grab a file or quickly changing the name of a document before emailing it off.\n\nI don\u2019t think people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.\n\nApple seems to want it both ways with the iPad Pro: it loves to tout the iPad\u2019s laptop-dwarfing sales figures and industry-leading performance, but when pushed on the iPad\u2019s limitations, the company insists that the iPad is still an ongoing attempt to build the future of computing, not a laptop replacement.\n\nBut after eight years, this double-sided argument is no longer tenable. Unlike virtually every other computer, the iPad is a product of Apple\u2019s singular vision: the company designs the display, the processor, the operating system, and the limits of the applications and accessories that plug into it. And after all this time, it\u2019s clear that whatever roadblocks and frustrations exist in using the iPad Pro are there because Apple wants them there. There just aren\u2019t that many excuses left.\n\nIt\u2019s an iPad\n\nLast year, when Dieter Bohn reviewed the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, he wrote that he hoped iOS 11 would make for a \u201csignificantly more powerful experience of using the iPad Pro as a computer, not just for \u2018iPad things.\u2019\u201d Well, we\u2019re on to iOS 12 and a new iPad Pro now, and I can say that we\u2019re still stuck just doing iPad things.\n\nIf you\u2019re the sort of person who might spend over $2,000 on a maxed-out iPad Pro, you probably know exactly why you need one, what you\u2019ll use it for, and whether it\u2019s worth it to you. You\u2019ll undoubtedly find the switch to USB-C convenient, the new Pencil to be much nicer, and the A12X to be a significant performance boost over previous iPads. You will get what you\u2019re paying for.\n\nBut if you\u2019re thinking about spending $799 on the cheapest 64GB 11-inch iPad Pro to replace your laptop, you should really ask yourself what you need a computer to do. There isn\u2019t a single other tablet on the market that can compete with the raw hardware of the iPad Pro, and there aren\u2019t many laptops that can either. But Apple\u2019s approach to iOS is holding that hardware back in serious and meaningful ways, and while USB-C makes life with this new iPad Pro slightly easier, it still has the same basic capabilities and limitations of last year\u2019s iPad Pro.\n\nIs the new iPad Pro a stunning engineering achievement? Without question. Has Apple once again produced mobile hardware that puts the rest of the industry to shame when it comes to performance, battery life, and design? Yep. Is the iPad Pro the best, most capable iPad ever made? It certainly is.\n\nBut you know what? It\u2019s still an iPad.", "description": "Apple completely redesigned the iPad Pro, and we spent a few days with it to review it.
