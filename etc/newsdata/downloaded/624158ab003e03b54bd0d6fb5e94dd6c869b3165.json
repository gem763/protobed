It\u2019s not just you\u2026there\u2019s too much animal cruelty in our community,' he said.", "description": "In August the dog's owner, from Sydney, was found to have severely neglected her dog, named JayZ, and was convicted of multiple counts of animal cruelty.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/04/20360220-0-image-a-28_1572410403904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
