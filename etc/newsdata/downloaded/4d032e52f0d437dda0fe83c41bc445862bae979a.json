That reality check may prove to be uncomfortable.\n\nA view of the city skyline and River Nile from Cairo tower building, October 27, 2011. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Files\n\nRare protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi served as a reminder of the turmoil that followed the 2011 overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, briefly upsetting the country\u2019s $12 billion stock market and putting pressure on its sovereign debt.\n\nMarkets stabilized this week after security forces managed to deter more dissent, reassuring investors who had piled in since Cairo struck a $12 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund in 2016.\n\nDevaluing its currency in 2016 and embarking on reforms, Egypt implemented austerity to help cut the deficit.\n\nYet investors fear authorities might roll back measures such as a cut in subsidies for fuel and other goods which have proved painful for Egyptians, a third of whom live below the poverty line.\n\n\u201cInvestors are wary of the risk of fiscal slippage through the reversal of subsidy reforms or raising spending on public sector wages or cash transfers,\u201d said Farouk Soussa, senior economist with Goldman Sachs.\n\n\u201cThe main risk is that any fiscal slippage could reduce the likelihood of Egypt coming to an agreement with the IMF over a new deal after the current one expires in November.\u201d\n\nIn a possible first sign of such slippage, the supply ministry said it had returned 1.8 million people to its food subsidy plan since February, following earlier cuts in the programme.\n\n\u201cWe are watching the government\u2019s response to this vocal but small minority to see if there\u2019s any type of populist policy response which would derail the economic reform programme,\u201d said Marshall Stocker, a portfolio manager at U.S.-based investment management firm Eaton Vance.\n\nHEFTY EXPOSURES\n\nEgypt\u2019s domestic government bond market has proven a hit with investors hunting for yield in a world where central banks are pushing interest rates ever lower. Yields of Egypt\u2019s sovereign bonds in the JPMorgan emerging local bond benchmark are near 14% - the highest across the index.\n\nIn August, foreign holdings of government debt including bills and bonds reached $20 billion, a sharp recovery from the $31 million trough in 2015 in the wake of the Arab Spring.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that as a foreign investment destination these past few years Egypt has not been attractive beyond the sale of short term debt, thanks to offering some of the highest interest rates on the market,\u201d said Timothy Kaldas from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.\n\nBut the combination of large financing requirements - Cairo needs to raise $6-7 billion in the next financial year, analysts say - and lack of detail on future engagement with the IMF beyond November means the best times for investors may be over.\n\nEgypt has a large financing need and \u201cthat can be challenging without an IMF backstop\u201d, said Ray Jian, head of EM aggregate debt at Amundi.\n\nEquities listed on Cairo\u2019s $12.2 billion bourse have also been popular: MSCI\u2019s Egypt stock index has soared 32% since the start of the year compared to the overall emerging equity index which has eked out a 3.6% gain over the same period.\n\nAllocations to Egyptian stocks among emerging market equity fund managers have ticked up in recent months with average holding weights hitting 4-year highs, according to Copley Fund Research.\n\nThere is some genuine discontent among ordinary Egyptians, said Andrew Brudenell, lead senior portfolio manager for frontier markets equities at Ashmore Group, adding that reforms were taking time and benefits had not yet trickled down to much of the population. \u201cHopefully this is just on the cusp of changing,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Hasnain Malik, managing director, frontier markets equity strategy at Tellimer, said last week\u2019s fall of 6% in the benchmark was not justified.\n\n\u201cThe Egypt market is still attractive compared to other emerging markets,\u201d he said.\n\nThe reforms have helped temper inflation but have failed to create jobs to meet the demands of a country of 100 million.\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) fell to $5.9 billion in the 2018/19 fiscal year from $7.7 billion the previous year - a far cry from the $11.5 billion foreseen by the IMF at the outset of its Egypt programme and the revised $9.5 billion from April.\n\nBusinessmen blamed bureaucracy, a slow judiciary and an expansion of firms linked to the military. Growth rose to 5.6% in 2018/19.\n\n\u201cEgypt needs growth of 6,7,8% of private sector led growth if people are going to feel it and living standards are generally going to increase,\u201d said Gregory Smith, sovereign debt strategist at Renaissance Capital.", "description": "Egypt's reputation as an emerging market star lost some of its sparkle last month when street protests revealed a population yet to benefit from years of economic reforms that had impressed investors.
