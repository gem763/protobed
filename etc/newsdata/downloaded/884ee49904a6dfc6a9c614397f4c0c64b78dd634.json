(CBC)\n\nSpring 2020\n\nSTO spokesperson Karine Sauv\u00e9 confirmed no date has been set for the switchover to Lyon station. She said the transit service needed six months notice to prepare its fall schedule, and said the change likely won't happen until next spring.\n\nSauv\u00e9 said the STO needs time to test the tweaked routes to ensure a smooth transition for both drivers and passengers.\n\nStarting Saturday, STO passes encoded with the capability to transfer can be used to board the Confederation Line, according to Pat Scrimgeour, OC Transpo\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b's director of transit customer systems and planning.", "description": "Transit riders from Gatineau hoping to transfer directly onto Ottawa's new Confederation Line once it opens Saturday will have to wait a while longer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4583331.1521496104!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ottawa-sto-bus-wellington-street-langevin-building.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
