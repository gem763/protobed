Gerhardt, an impeachment scholar at the University of North Carolina, as saying.\n\nAnd Trump, the Times said, \u201cmade clear he was ready for a fight.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post cover went with \u201cHouse opens impeachment inquiry,\u201d with stories on the shadow Ukraine policy ran by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, an analysis about the uncertain process, and Trump\u2019s attack on globalism that he delivered at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cSeveral officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president\u2019s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump\u2019s political gain,\u201d read the Post story on Giuliani.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal cover was \u201cImpeachment inquiry begins,\u201d and an analysis on the risks to both Trump and Democrats.\n\nPelosi, notes the Journal\u2019s Gerald Seib, had \u201cresisted pressure bubbling up from the liberal base\u201d for months. But \u201cwhat had started as a fringe idea within the party became a mainstream demand with remarkable speed.\u201d The trigger, he wrote, was an op-ed from seven House Democratic freshmen \u2014 all of whom had served either in the military or national-security agencies, all of whom hailed from swing districts.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Dow industrials DJIA, -0.53% ended 142 points lower.
