He came off the bench in the second half with the Pumas in charge against Tonga at 28-7. They prevailed 28-12. But Sanchez missed out on the matchday 23 to play England, and was replaced in the reserves by Lucas Mensa, who was surprised. Mensa prefers to play inside center but said he can back up starting flyhalf Benjamin Urdapilleta.\n\n\u201cThese are games where everyone has to play a part, but we know the important thing is the team,\u201d reserve scrumhalf Felipe Ezcurra said at the captain\u2019s run on Friday. \u201cNico (Sanchez) is an example to the whole team in that sense, in terms of how he is conducting himself and how he transmits to everyone that the important thing is the group and not individuals. That makes us very strong.\u201d\n\nLoosehead prop Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro expects Argentina\u2019s scrum to be targeted because it has been mediocre of late for the Pumas.\n\n\u201cThe scrum will be a barometer,\u201d Tetaz Chaparro admitted. \u201cThey\u2019re very explosive, that\u2019s why we have to be dynamic. We have to try to steal a march, both in the maul and the scrum. We also have to be firm and play on our terms. If we have to slow the ball down, so be it.\u201d\n\nEngland will face a challenge of its \u201cmanlihood,\u201d according to coach Eddie Jones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a test of manlihood, so you have to take them on up front; scrum, maul, ruck attack, ruck defense. That\u2019s where it will be won,\u201d he said.\n\nJones added that England can\u2019t be thinking of eliminating the dangerous Pumas. Instead, they must think of advancing themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is not a matter of us taking advantage (of Argentina\u2019s desperation), it\u2019s a matter of us preparing well for the game,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe have prepared well, and physically we are in the best position we have ever been in.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be seduced by Argentina\u2019s state. We know they play with a lot of pride and a lot of passion and that will be multiplied by the fact they are in a game that\u2019s very important to them. The passion and pride come down to the toughness of your play. But then there\u2019s emotional control because when you have a lot of passion and pride, it tends to multiply your strengths and multiply your weaknesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a tea bag isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t know how good it is until you put it in hot water.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Argentina is using the selflessness of axed flyhalf Nicolas Sanchez to bond even more before it make-or-break Rugby World Cup match against England on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
