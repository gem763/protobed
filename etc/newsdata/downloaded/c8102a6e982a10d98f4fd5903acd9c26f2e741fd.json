The report said \u201cI Love America\u201d was founded in 2017 but had moved heavily into pro-Trump content and conservative memes in recent weeks, building a huge audience in the process.\n\nData showed the \u201cI Love America\u201d pages collectively generated tens of millions of \u201cinteractions,\u201d a metric capturing how many people like, share or comment on a post, on par with several of the largest American news sites. \u201cI Love America\u201d also reposted memes from Russian sources, such as the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg troll farm that faces criminal charges stemming from its efforts to manipulate the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe problem of foreigners controlling political pages aimed at Americans is a persistent issue on Facebook. Macedonian businessmen ran the \u201cVets for Trump\u201d Facebook page for several months after one of them hijacked it in March. It took until August for the longtime administrators \u2014 who were in fact veterans who supported President Trump \u2014 to regain control of the page.\n\n[The Facebook page \u2018Vets for Trump\u2019 was hijacked by a North Macedonian businessman]\n\nFacebook initially did not act against \u201cI Love America,\u201d according to Popular Information, which quoted the company saying that it didn\u2019t violate the platform\u2019s rules against \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d After the story spread widely on Monday, Facebook removed the page, citing alleged violations of its policies against spam and fake accounts.\n\n\u201cWe are removing these pages for violating our policies against spam and fake accounts and are continuing to investigate for any further violations,\u201d Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said.\n\nFacebook removed nine pages in all, including several devoted to dogs and others with political content, including \u201cI Love Jesus Forever\u201d and \u201cGod Bless Donald Trump and God Bless America.\u201d The pages appeared to work in concert by cross-posting content, according to Popular Information.\n\nFacebook said it had not detected links to any nation-state actor but that its investigation was still ongoing.\n\nAmong the several politically charged memes posted by \u201cI Love America\u201d was one showing the image of a grieving widow with text reading, \u201cTHOSE WHO DISRESPECT OUR FLAG HAVE NEVER BEEN HANDED A FOLDED ONE\u201d \u2014 a reference to the flags given to the families of service members and veterans after they die. This meme was previously posted by the Internet Research Agency.", "description": "Facebook took action against the page \u2014 which had 1.1 million followers \u2014 and several affiliated ones after a report in Popular Information detailed the page\u2019s Ukrainian management and remarkable reach.", "authors": ["Craig Timberg", "National Reporter Covering Technology", "September At Pm", "Craig Timberg Is A National Technology Reporter For The Washington Post.
