The emergence of Serge Gnabry as a regular starter and the arrival of Philippe Coutinho have pushed him out of the picture.\n\nCoutinho has struck up a superb partnership with Robert Lewandowski and that has left Niko Kovac with no option but to bench Muller.\n\nThe German's people have made United aware he's available but he ideally wants Champions League football. Unfortunately Solskjaer doesn't look likely to be in a position to offer that any time soon.\n\nThomas Muller has found himself dropped to the bench in recent weeks for Bayern Munich\n\nJames Maddison\n\nUnited spent big on British talent this summer, welcoming Harry Magurie, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Dan James. They want to continue that trend by welcoming James Maddison next.\n\nThe attacking midfielder would provide the creativity United are lacking and his performances this season have been sensational. He scored in the win over Spurs and netted in front of the Kop last time out.\n\nLeicester do not want to lose their prized asset in January though with Brendan Rodgers refusing to let Maddison go amid the club's push for European football.\n\nBrendan Rodgers is unlikely to let James Maddison leave Leicester before the season is over\n\nJadon Sancho\n\nSancho would solve United's problem on the right side for years to come but they must fork out close to \u00a3100million to land the England star.\n\nHe has excelled for Borussia Dortmund since leaving rivals Manchester City and breaking into the first team and is wanted by almost every European giant.\n\nDortmund are also against losing him in January and it is thought a lack of Champions League football may steer Sancho to one of United's rivals instead.\n\nDortmund star Jadon Sancho would solve United's long-standing problems on the right wing\n\nSean Longstaff\n\nThe Newcastle midfielder came onto United's radar last season when he burst onto the scene under Rafa Benitez.\n\nHe was on the summer shortlist at Old Trafford but a \u00a350m asking price meant a deal was always unlikely, especially given the 21-year-old had only played a handful of times in the Premier League.\n\nLongstaff was also recovering from knee-ligament damage and his form this season has been nowhere near the standard he set last term. The Magpies are still holding out for \u00a350m-plus based on what United paid for Wan-Bissaka in the summer.\n\nNewcastle are holding out for \u00a350m plus for Sean Longstaff if they are to sell to United\n\nEric Dier\n\nThe dramatic fall in Nemanja Matic's form has left a huge hole at the base of United's midfield, which has not helped their defence so far this season.\n\nDier could be the man to fill the gap after being relegated to the bench after falling out of favour under Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nNegotiations with Spurs chief Daniel Levy are always tough though and the uncertainty surrounding Pochettino's future may mean they are unwilling to do business in January.\n\nEric Dier has dropped to the bench after falling out of favour under Mauricio Pochettino\n\nMoussa Dembele\n\nSportsmail understands United have sent a scout to watch the French striker three times so far this season.\n\nDembele has been in fine form and already has six goals from eight appearances in Ligue 1. His previous spell in the Premier League with Fulham would also mean he'd need little time to settle in.\n\nLyon are in the midst of a crisis at the moment though, suffering their worst start to a season since 1995, and it would take a huge offer to lure away their main man over the winter.\n\nUnited have sent a scout to watch Lyon's Moussa Dembele three times so far this season\n\nOdsonne Edouard\n\nEdouard is a slightly left field option but could prove to be great value for United at around \u00a330m as an alternative striker.\n\nThe Celtic forward has scored nine goals already this season and some of Europe's leading clubs are starting to take note of his maturing performances over the past two years.\n\nUnited's chances of landing him may be damaged by interest from Napoli and Borussia Dortmund but a deal could be possible if scouts can convince him Old Trafford is the place to be.\n\nCeltic's Odsonne Edouard is starting to attract interest from some of Europe's biggest club\n\nSamuel Chukwueze\n\nThe Nigeria winger is one of Europe's hot prospects at 20-years-old after bursting onto the scene with Villarreal.\n\nHe has drawn comparisons with Arjen Robben due to his dribbling technique and featured regularly for Villarreal throughout the 2018-19 season, where they finished 14th in La Liga and reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League.\n\nSimilarly to Valencia's Ferran Torres, another wide man of interest to United, other clubs are interested in Chukwueze and a lack of Champions League football may prove costly in their pursuit.", "description": "January will be crucial for Manchester United as they continue the overhaul of their squad.
