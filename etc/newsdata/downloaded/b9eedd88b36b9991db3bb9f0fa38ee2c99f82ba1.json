(Getty Images)\n\nHe\u2019s got the frame of Jon Jones, the dynamism of a prime Anderson Silva and the ability to sell a fight like Conor McGregor.\n\nIsrael Adesanya is not only the undisputed middleweight champion after a rousing second-round knockout of Robert Whittaker Saturday before a record crowd of 57,127 at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia, in the main event of UFC 243, he\u2019s also a bonafide superstar.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nGuys are going to be moving up from welterweight and down from light heavyweight with the hope of landing a fight with him, because they\u2019ll make their biggest paychecks against him.\n\nHe danced his way to the cage on Saturday, having fun and appearing relaxed as if he was heading to the park to chug a few beers and play a softball game with the guys in the neighborhood. But he fought with the precision and cool of Jones and Silva, two of the greatest to ever set foot in the Octagon.\n\nIt\u2019s always hard to put a finger on what makes someone a star, but you know it when you see it. Fans react to fighters who give them something they can\u2019t get elsewhere and you know the instant you see and hear Adesanya that he has the ability to move people. He did an elaborate entrance with three dancers that needed special approval by UFC president Dana White.\n\nAs Whittaker walked to the cage, Adesanya grooved to the champion\u2019s entrance music.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m Hollywood,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was composed and in his element once the bell sounded, a guy who was where he knew he was meant to be and was doing what he loved. Whittaker tried to close the gap by leaping it and hitting Adesanya with a few jabs, but there was never a moment of worry or look of concern on Adesanya\u2019s face.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe was moving out of the way of Whittaker\u2019s punches, but not so much so that he took himself out of range. And when the moment presented itself, he took advantage.\n\nHe dropped Whittaker just before the bell sounded to end Round 1, a round that Whittaker probably would have won had Adesanya not landed that shot to drop him.\n\nThe end came just as quickly in the second, when Adesanya avoided a Whitaker shot and hit him with a right hand-left hook combination that finished the fight.\n\nWhittaker gave up four inches of height and 6\u00bd inches of reach, and struggled to lay hands on Adesanya.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tricky to hit,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cHe\u2019s very tall and he\u2019s good at leaning back.\u201d\n\nAdesanya was like a cobra, waiting for the right moment to lunge forward and strike. As a result, Whittaker had the sense he was in control of the bout.\n\n\u201cI was doing well until I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Whittaker said, grinning ruefully.\n\nWhittaker spoke of a rematch, and while he may get one down the line, he didn\u2019t do anything Saturday to make the UFC believe the outcome would be any different. Whittaker is a world-class fighter and Adesanya clinically took him apart.\n\nRobert Whittaker and Israel Adesanya trade punches in their UFC middleweight championship fight Saturday in Melbourne, Australia. (Getty Images)\n\nTiming always plays a role in a fighter\u2019s rise to stardom and Adesanya\u2019s entrance onto the scene comes at a perfect spot. He\u2019s got potentially great opponents, led by unbeaten Brazilian Paulo Costa, who was cageside Saturday.\n\nCosta, who is built like a tank, is coming off a stirring victory over Yoel Romero at UFC 241 in August.\n\nGiven their ability to put people to sleep, an Adesanya-Costa fight figures to be big business.\n\nBut Costa isn\u2019t alone. Adesanya has a burgeoning rivalry with Jones, the UFC\u2019s light heavyweight champion and the sport\u2019s OG until this point. Adesanya, though, has dared to taunt Jones and \u201cBones\u201d has reacted angrily.\n\nAdesanya even suggested at one point before the card that he\u2019d be down for a superfight with heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic, who is also 6-4 with an 80-inch reach but who has 50 or 60 pounds right now on Adesanya.\n\nUFC officials have to be salivating over a future with Adesanya, who seems poised to become the sport\u2019s biggest star.\n\n\u201cI think Israel Adesanya can fill stadiums anywhere in the world,\u201d said Lawrence Epstein, the UFC\u2019s chief operating officer who pinch hit for White at the post-fight news conference. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this guy\u2019s going to be a huge star. He\u2019s incredibly charismatic. He\u2019s got a style that is really, really interesting. He\u2019s got an incredible personality, so I think you\u2019re going to see him involved in a lot of big events in Las Vegas, Australia and who knows where else. There are a lot of big events for this guy in his future.\u201d\n\nWhile still in the Octagon, Adesanya asked Marvel Comics, \u201cLet\u2019s do something together.\u201d One gets the impression that Marvel executives were probably giddy hearing that and that many major companies will look to do business with him.\n\nHe made the win Saturday sound simple, and said he was ready to adjust if necessary.\n\n\u201cHe threw everything we expected,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cLike I said in the New York fight [against Derek Brunson], we had everything from Plan A to Plan B to Plan C. In this one, we had plans all the way up to Z. It\u2019s honestly unreal.\u201d\n\nBut it is very real. This is a guy with otherworldly talent and the charisma to match.\n\nFortunes change in the fight game, particularly MMA, in an instant, but Adesanya is going to be around for a while.\n\nMuch like for the last five years everyone around 145 or 155 pounds mentioned McGregor\u2019s name, the same is going to happen for the next few years with Adesanya.\n\nThat tells you all you need to know about how big Adesanya has become in his less than two years in the UFC.\n\nHe\u2019s the money fight even for some of the best fighters in the world.\n\nThe good times are about to roll.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "He\u2019s got the frame of Jon Jones, the dynamism of a prime Anderson Silva and the ability to sell a fight like Conor McGregor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oWMtPES3LzgrpmZRqbsnxQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NDYuOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DFQhfJchGcFgflOqCSVWHg--~B/aD0zMTc2O3c9NDgwMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/11ea1780-e807-11e9-bde7-1c85937e96c3", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
