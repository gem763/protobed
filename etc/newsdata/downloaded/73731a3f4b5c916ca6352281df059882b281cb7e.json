La determinaci\u00f3n de reparar el sufrimiento de las v\u00edctimas del franquismo guio siempre la acci\u00f3n del Gobierno. El Supremo avala la exhumaci\u00f3n de los restos de Franco y su traslado a El Pardo. Justicia, memoria y dignidad. \u2014 Pedro S\u00e1nchez (@sanchezcastejon) September 24, 2019\n\nThe decision \u2014 which is directly enforceable, even though relatives could still appeal to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights \u2014 sets the stage for a highly political showdown as Spain gears up for a general election on November 10.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo told reporters on Tuesday that the government wantsd to carry out the disinterment \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d suggesting it will be done before the official electoral campaign kicks off on November 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very satisfied,\u201d Calvo said of the court\u2019s decision. \u201cWe were the only European democracy which had a dictator in a state mausoleum.\u201d\n\nFranco's descendants had attempted to block the exhumation in the courts, with successive appeals. They had also demanded that his remains be reburied in La Almudena Cathedral in downtown Madrid if they were removed from the Valley of the Fallen.\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected both appeals on Tuesday.\n\nSocialist 'campaign plan'\n\nThe ruling has the potential to play a significant role in the November election.\n\nOn one hand, the Socialists successfully mobilized the electorate in the last national ballot in April in part by warning of the rise of the far right \u2014 and the unearthing of Franco's remains could once again play that role if it sparks protests by franquistas.\n\nOn the other hand, the rise of the far-right party Vox, which entered parliament in April, is set to complicate the position of the whole right-wing spectrum in Spanish politics on this subject.\n\n\u201cWe have to leave the dead in peace,\u201d Vox\u2019s spokesperson Iv\u00e1n Espinosa told reporters in Congress. \u201cThis is nothing other than the campaign plan of the Socialist Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunately, the dictatorship of Franco ended 44 years ago. S\u00e1nchez has been playing with his bones for one year to divide us between reds and blues,\u201d tweeted the center-right Ciudadanos\u2019 leader Albert Rivera.\n\n\"We have to leave the dead in peace\" \u2014 Spanish far-right party Vox's spokesperson Iv\u00e1n Espinosa\n\nPablo Casado, leader of the conservative Popular Party, which was founded in the late 1970s by a former Francoist minister, didn\u2019t immediately react to the news.\n\nIn September 2018, the Spanish parliament approved a law allowing the government to carry out the exhumation. The bill was promoted by the Socialists and backed by the far-left and regional nationalists. Both the Popular Party and Ciudadanos abstained in the vote.\n\nFranco launched a military coup against the democratic government of Spain in 1936, emerged victorious after a three-year-long civil war which left hundreds of thousands of victims and ruled the country until his death in 1975.\n\nHe ordered the construction of the Valley of the Fallen after the civil war and inaugurated it in 1959. Some 34,000 victims of the conflict and repression, from Franco\u2019s side and the defeated Republicans, are buried in the site, some of them unidentified.\n\nThe associations for historical memory and victims of Franco had long demanded that his remains be removed from the Valley of the Fallen, essentially arguing that he wasn\u2019t a victim of the civil war \u2014 as was the case with the other people buried at the site \u2014 but the leader who provoked it.\n\nIn 2011, a national commission of experts argued that Franco\u2019s remains should be removed, a position that was endorsed in 2014 by U.N. human rights expert Pablo de Greiff in a series of recommendations to Spain on how to deal with Franco's legacy.", "description": "Digging up the dictator\u2019s bones could stir the left-right divide in Spain\u2019s election in November.", "authors": ["Diego Torres"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-2637603-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
