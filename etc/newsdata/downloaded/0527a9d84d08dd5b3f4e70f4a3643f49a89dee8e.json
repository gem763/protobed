But it\u2019s also a story about a death threat, a million dollars, a tragic car accident, and organic mint jelly.\n\nLet\u2019s start from the beginning.\n\nThe nine lambs arrived at Antioch College, a private liberal arts school in Ohio, last spring as part of a \u201cliving laboratory\u201d and sustainability program on the Antioch College Farm.\n\nUltimately, they were destined to feed students in the nearby dining hall. But as they grazed in their solar panel-adorned meadow and matured into sheep, they also drew the fevered attention of animal rights activists who hoped to save them from slaughter.\n\nOn Thursday, school officials told The Daily Beast that they would let go of the sheep for $1 million\u2014but that they would use the money to buy more lambs to butcher for next year\u2019s living laboratory. (For reference, a lamb costs between $50 and $250 to purchase, depending on age and location, and then about $20 per month to sustain until, well, you know.)\n\nThe campaign to save the animals began over the summer when Dr. David Nibert, a neighbor of the college and a sociology professor at Wittenberg University, said he felt called to be \u201can advocate\u201d for the creatures. Despite Nibert\u2019s fervor, his Committee to Save the Antioch Lambs, his phone calls, his letters to the college, his fliers, his collection of 100 scholar signatures, and his Change.org petition, the college has doubled down on its plan.\n\n\u201cOur dining hall serves mostly organic food grown on local farms, including our own working farm on campus,\u201d the university said in a statement. \u201cVegan and vegetarian options are an important part of every meal served, along with ethically sourced meat from our farm and other local farms because the majority of our students are omnivores.\u201d\n\nBut, in Nibert\u2019s view: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that one of the most progressive colleges probably in the history of the United States is also now involved in the raising and killing of animals.\u201d\n\nOthers clearly agree, as the petition he started three months ago has received nearly 79,000 signatures.\n\n\u201cYet Another Act of Senseless Violence\u201d\n\nThen, last month, Nibert\u2019s campaign caught PETA\u2019s attention.\n\nThe organization sent a letter to Antioch College President Tom Manley, in which it offered to cover the costs of re-homing the animals and to donate the equivalent amount of food in the form of \u201chealthy vegan meat.\u201d\n\nKilling the animals, the group wrote, \u201cwould subject the Dayton area to yet another act of senseless violence.\u201d The letter apparently referred to the mass shooting on Aug. 4, in which 10 people were killed and 27 others were injured in Dayton.\n\n\u201cAntioch College prides itself on being progressive, but this plan is out of touch and flies in the face of efforts to help young people relate to others, stop bullying, object to the burning of the Amazon rainforest for meat production, take personal responsibility for healthy and humane living, and more,\u201d said PETA President Ingrid Newkirk.\n\n\u201cThe school is putting its students on a path to insensitivity toward those who are different from them and promoting a filthy meat-eating habit that's linked to heart disease, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer later in life,\u201d she added.\n\nFrom there things escalated, culminating in a death threat against a member of the college\u2019s staff.\n\nYellow Springs Police Chief Brian Carlson told The Daily Beast on Thursday that a caller to a receptionist\u2019s private cell number allegedly said: \u201cI just got a message from PETA about the animals that you people want to slaughter. Nine lambs to feed your college students. I should slaughter your fucking family, bitch.\u201d\n\nAnother caller left a recorded message on the same woman\u2019s private cellphone, threatening to share her contact information with other activists, said Carlson. Officers collected the cellphone numbers of both callers and are investigating the case as \u201ctelephone harassment,\u201d he added.\n\nYellow Springs police, along with campus security, have also \u201cstepped up patrols\u201d near campus over protests by PETA activists in the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cThey were peaceful, they just had signs,\u201d said Carlson.\n\nAmid the intense backlash and harassment, the college maintains that Nibert and his supporters have used a rabid campaign to force the school to bend to the will of outsiders who aren\u2019t even part of the Antioch community.\n\n\u201cIt is ironic that our community, which seeks to find better and more sustainable ways of living, has become a target because of our commitment to sourcing ethically and locally raised food,\u201d a college spokesman in a statement.\n\n\u201cEven while Antioch College students are engaged in meaningful work on campus and out in the world\u2014addressing serious issues facing humanity and our planet, including sustainable food production and environmental justice\u2014they are facing online stalking and harassment from people with no knowledge of their work or the college\u2019s programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne Million Dollars\u201d\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Barbara Pearl heard about the sheep. Pearl is a vegan, as was her son Jason Seth Houten, who attended Antioch College before he was struck and killed by a car while walking in a crosswalk in 2002, at the age of 23.\n\n\u201cHe would never condone this,\u201d said Pearl. \u201cHe would be horrified by this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can look at them in their face and then exploit them and slit their throats. They have a heartbeat and a mother and a face,\u201d Pearl told The Daily Beast this week. \u201cThey also have a will to live. Nothing goes to its death willingly. If you gave these lambs a choice, I\u2019m sure they would choose life.\u201d\n\nPearl, who lives in Philadelphia and said she teaches mathematics at local community colleges, wrote an open letter last week to Manley on Jason\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cI have never been able to find a way to honor his memory,\u201d Pearl wrote in her letter. \u201cI am asking you to stop this practice in honor of my son and as a memorial to him.\u201d\n\nPearl also contacted the school directly to plead with administrators to save the animals. She told The Daily Beast that she asked Susanne Hashim, vice president for advancement, what it would take to save the lambs.\n\nHashim allegedly responded: \u201c$1 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made arrangements with a sanctuary and am willing to give a donation to the school,\u201d Pearl told The Daily Beast, but she said she wasn\u2019t sure whether she would be able to pull together the money.\n\nWhen contacted by The Daily Beast about this purported offer, a university spokesperson replied: \u201cThe college would willingly sell the sheep for $1 million as this would be a good business decision. Our students might not have the full farm-to-table experience, but a portion of the $1 million would be applied to the cost of purchasing locally-grown humanely and sustainably farmed meat for consumption by our students who are omnivores and towards the purchase of next year\u2019s solar sheep.\u201d\n\nAnd so, in effect, Pearl\u2019s money would ultimately buy more lambs for the slaughter.\n\n\u201cAntioch College is not planning to alter its farm-to-table and sustainability programs,\u201d said the school\u2019s statement.\n\nA spokesman declined to comment on the date the sheep would meet their maker and so could not say how long Pearl would have to raise the money, if she decided to attempt it.\n\nPearl said on Thursday that she was \u201cgravely disappointed\u201d by the school\u2019s reaction to her offer, calling the statement an \u201cattempt to extort a million dollars in response to a mother\u2019s plea to memorialize her son.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is heartbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cMy son Jason chose to be a vegan after attending Antioch College, embraced helping others in need, and was proactive against animal exploitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBanning this program is a call for compassion and an opportunity for the college to demonstrate the progressive values they so strongly advocate in the eyes of the public, which in turn could encourage donations and attract more students to the college,\u201d Pearl added.\n\nWhen reached on Thursday, Nibert also condemned the school\u2019s response, calling Pearl\u2019s letter to the college \u201cbeautiful and poignant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is shocking and appalling that Antioch has responded to this appeal with the demand of one million dollars, money they say will then be used to buy even more young lambs who similarly will be destined for the slaughterhouse,\u201d said Nibert.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Antioch\u2019s reaction thus far to the outpouring of support for the lambs on their campus has been reflexive, insular, mean-spirited, and now extortive. In a world characterized by so much cruelty and violence, many around the country and the world are dismayed to learn that Antioch College is raising and killing animals,\u201d he continued.\n\nOrganic Mint Jelly\n\nBut graduates of the school remain divided on the issue, according to screenshots of a private Antioch College alumni Facebook group obtained by The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cAnyone advocating for PETA to come in and harass Antioch is the enemy of the staff, teachers, students, and administration of the college,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cWe have reached peak stupidity with this.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote: \u201cIf Antioch kills these lambs, I will be ashamed to say I went to Antioch.\u201d\n\nIn the heat of the back-and-forth, Tex Clark, a public defender based in Portland, Oregon, shared a GoFundMe campaign she created to buy $500 of organic mint jelly for students at the school to use when they finally sit down to eat their locall -raised mutton.\n\nSome in the alumni group found humor in the campaign, which, at press time, had raised $451. Another alum, by contrast, wrote that he found it \u201cremarkably insensitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very Antioch to raise money through something funny and irreverent that has something serious behind it,\u201d Clark, a 1995 Antioch graduate, told The Daily Beast on Thursday. \u201cBut it was mostly to make us feel better.\u201d\n\n\u201cLamb for dinner is not the principle that is motivating this,\u201d Clark added.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s lazy activism to seek attention targeting a small college with a sustainable farming program,\u201d said Clark. \u201cYellow Springs is surrounded on four sides by big agriculture, factory farms, pig operations, etc. But challenging bad actors is hard and doesn\u2019t make the news.\u201d\n\nClark also said that she has compassion for Pearl\u2019s personal tragedy, but that, in her mind: \u201cWhen you ratchet up the stakes like that, it\u2019s a tough way to have a dialogue.\u201d\n\nOthers, meanwhile, were just happy to see their alma mater in the news.\n\n\u201cHey, press for Antioch!\u201d one commenter wrote.", "description": "The mother of a vegan alum who died in a car accident has joined the months-long campaign to save the animals in honor of her son.
