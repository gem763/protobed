All were aged between 19 and 22.\n\nMilat was arrested after targeting another backpacker, British man Paul Onions, who escaped and alerted police.\n\nA subsequent trial heard that Milat had searched for hitchhikers to abduct from a major highway between Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nThe bodies of his victims were found buried in the Belanglo State Forest, 120km (75 miles) south-west of Sydney, in 1992 and 1993.\n\nMilat was diagnosed with terminal oesophagus and stomach cancer earlier this year.", "description": "Milat murdered seven hitchhikers between 1989 and 1992 and dumped their bodies in a state forest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/53AB/production/_107091412_9c0b4786-1a57-4f06-bf54-4e3852521b40.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
