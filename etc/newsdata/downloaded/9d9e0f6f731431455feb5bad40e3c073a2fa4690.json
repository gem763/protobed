Ward said he thought the manager was making a joke. But then, he said, the manager started yelling and threatening to call the police. Ward said that the waitress indicated that she was there on her own accord, but got out of the vehicle and he didn't see her for the rest of the night.", "description": "Insider uncovered the story while investigating Los Angeles nightlife company The H.wood Group, which is popular among celebrities.", "authors": ["Ashley Collman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A0Pfsrk2SX0u23Cs3K_2FA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/da4e605b437b8743308cdad612892b05", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
