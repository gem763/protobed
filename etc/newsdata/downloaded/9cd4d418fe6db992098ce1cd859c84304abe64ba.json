But his narrow victory didn\u2019t erase questions about whether President Donald Trump and his party\u2019s congressional candidates face troubling headwinds approaching 2020.\n\nBishop, 55, a state senator best known for a North Carolina law dictating which public bathrooms transgender people can use, defeated centrist Democrat Dan McCready. Bishop tied himself tightly to Trump, who staged an election-eve rally for him in the district, and Tuesday\u2019s voting seemed no less than a referendum on the president, who quickly took credit for the triumph.\n\n\u201cDan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race. Big Rally last night,\u201d Trump tweeted. No polling has emerged publicly that showed Bishop with a deficit of that magnitude. Operatives from both parties and analysts had long said the race was too close to call.\n\nThe results in the district underscored the rural-urban split between the parties, with Bishop running up substantial numbers in outlying areas and McCready eroding GOP advantages in suburban areas. McCready\u2019s moderate profile resembled that of many Democrats who won in Republican-leaning districts in the 2018 midterms and, even with the loss on Tuesday, showed the durability of that approach.\n\nBishop\u2019s margin was far less than the 11 percentage points by which Trump captured the district in 2016. And it was only slightly greater than when then-GOP candidate Mark Harris seemed to win the seat over McCready, 36, last year \u2014 before those results were annulled after evidence surfaced of vote tampering.\n\nRepublicans have held the seat since 1963, and its loss would have been a worrisome preface to the party\u2019s presidential and congressional campaigns next year.\n\n\u201cI think it means Trump is going to get a second term and Republicans will retake the majority,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in an interview with The Associated Press. Many analysts think a GOP takeover will be difficult.\n\nSpecial elections generally attract such low turnout that their results aren\u2019t predictive of future general elections. Even so, the narrow margin in the GOP-tilted district suggested that Democrats\u2019 2018 string of victories in suburban districts in red states including Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas could persist next year.\n\nThere is almost no pathway to Republicans regaining House control next year unless they avoid losing more suburban districts and win back some they lost last year.\n\nThe district stretches from Charlotte, one of the nation\u2019s financial nerve centers, through its flourishing eastern suburbs and into less prosperous rural counties along the South Carolina line. More than half its voters were expected to come from the suburbs.\n\nSince Trump became president, voters in such communities \u2014 particularly women and college-educated voters \u2014 have abandoned Trump in droves over his conservative social policies and vitriolic rhetoric on immigration and race.\n\nSuburban defections would also jeopardize the reelection prospects of Trump, who\u2019s already facing slipping poll numbers. Limiting the erosion of those voters will be crucial for him to retain swing states like North Carolina, which he won by less than 4 percentage points in 2016.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s vote showed that Bishop benefited from the district\u2019s conservative leanings.\n\n\u201cBishop, his policies follow my convictions \u2014 after hearing Bishop, knowing that he\u2019s for the Second Amendment and he\u2019s against illegal immigration,\u201d said Susie Sisk, 73, another retiree from Mint Hill. The registered Democrat said she voted for Bishop.\n\nMcCready, a former Marine turned financier of solar energy projects, was banking on the district\u2019s suburban moderates to carry him over the top.\n\nAlong with a GOP victory in a second vacant House district in North Carolina, Republicans pared the Democratic majority in the House to 235-199, plus one independent. That means to win control of the chamber in 2020, Republicans will need to gain 19 seats, which a slew of GOP retirements, anti-Trump sentiment among moderate voters and demographic changes suggest will be difficult.\n\nIn the day\u2019s other special election, Republican Greg Murphy, a doctor and state legislator, as expected defeated Democrat Allen Thomas to keep a House district along North Carolina\u2019s Atlantic coast.\n\nThat seat has been vacant since February, when 13-term GOP Rep. Walter Jones died, and Trump won it handily in 2016.\n\nThe bathroom law that Bishop sponsored was repealed after it prompted a national outcry and boycotts that The Associated Press estimated cost North Carolina $3.7 billion.\n\nBishop bound himself tightly to Trump, backing his proposed border wall with Mexico and accusing Trump critics of being intent on \u201cdestroying him.\u201d In a TV spot airing Election Day, he said his opponent is \u201cbacked by radicals\u201d as the screen flashed the faces of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders and outspoken liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nMcCready used his creation of a company that\u2019s financed solar energy projects to cast himself as a job creator and environmental champion. He also focused on containing health care costs and ran a spot featuring his trademark promise to prioritize \u201ccountry over party.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, McCready lost by 900 votes to Harris, the Republican. That decision followed allegations of vote fraud by a Republican political consultant, and Harris opted to not run again.\n\nAnother jolt of notoriety occurred in July when Trump staged a rally for Bishop in nearby Greenville. Trump said four Democratic women of color should \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, though all but one was born in the U.S. The crowd began chanting \u201cSend her back.\u201d", "description": "Conservative Republican Dan Bishop won a special election Tuesday for an open House seat in North Carolina, averting a Democratic capture of a GOP-leaning...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR054_bishop_ZG_20190910222141.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
