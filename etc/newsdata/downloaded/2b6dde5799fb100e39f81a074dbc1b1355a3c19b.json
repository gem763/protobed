And there have been times when I have been fighting as well.\n\nThinking: The Korean-Canadian actor (pictured as Eve Polastri) is interested in figuring out is what it means to be Asian in the West\n\nEve was shot (on the ground) by Villanelle in the season 2 cliffhanger\n\n'This has something to do with the psychological depths Eve has gone to and she wonders if that\u2019s why the show has struck such a nerve, particularly among women: \u201cEve is changing, and the deeper you go, the deeper the resonance can be\".'\n\nThe Korean-Canadian actor is interested in figuring out is what it means to be Asian in the West.\n\nShe explained that when she first received the script for Killing Eve, she couldn\u2019t make out which role was for her, taking for granted that it wasn\u2019t the lead.\n\nVillanelle: Jodie Comer (pictured) plays Sandra's lovesick partner - the pair have a love hate relationship and often try to kill one another\n\nShe said: 'I still wonder what that was about. That was one of those moments when you believe you are on a journey, making progress, and then you realize, inside you are back here.\n\n'I was filled with shame, anger, humiliation, heartbreak. And that was only three years ago.'\n\nThe success of Killing Eve has helped her to move on, and has also led to a number of breakthroughs, including Oh becoming the first Asian-American woman to be nominated for a Lead Actress Emmy, to host the Golden Globes, and to win multiple Golden Globes (after her Best Supporting Actress gong for Grey\u2019s Anatomy in 2006).\n\nSad: 'I was filled with shame, anger, humiliation, heartbreak. And that was only three years ago' - Sandra on why she had ruled out that she could be the lead when she got the script for Eve\n\nSandra revealed she took her mother and father to see the billboards for Killing Eve in 2018.\n\nShe said: 'This is what I really love about my parents. Not only is it, this is my daughter on this billboard, it\u2019s absolutely an Asian face too, and that has a profound meaning for them, which we don\u2019t need to talk about, but I know they carry it.\n\n'And I know they carry it for everyone in their generation.'\n\nThe star also discussed her first role outside of college, a TV film about Canadian poet Evelyn Lau.\n\nShe said: 'It was very difficult subject matter. With scenes of Evelyn doing drugs and being a prostitute.\n\n'[My mom had] this very old-school mentality that acting is one step above prostitution, and the first thing I do is play a prostitute!\n\n'It aired and the next week at church some people were not [supportive]. But I never felt any pressure because [my parents sided with me] and that was clearly very difficult.\n\n'The only thing I remember [my mom] saying to me afterwards was, \u2018That must have been very hard.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing the ways we feel understood by our parents.'\n\nTo read Porter on iPhone, iPad and Android, visit www.net-a-porter.com/porter or download the NET-A-PORTER app from the App Store and Google Play", "description": "She plays Eve Polastri in BBC's hit show, Killing Eve and Sandra Oh revealed a major spoiler ahead of season three's debut next year.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19880288-0-image-a-43_1571395638619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
