She kept her cool completely. But he called her a third-rate politician. He said that there are communists involved and you guys might like that. This was not a dialogue. It was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts.\"\n\nMichael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/REX via Shutterstock\n\nPelosi said the president was \"shaken\" because the House had just voted overwhelmingly, 354-60, on a non-binding resolution criticizing the president's decision to withdraw troops from northeastern Syria.\n\nOn returning to the Capitol, Pelosi continued her criticism.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very sad commentary on the president of the United States that he doesn\u2019t have enough confidence in what he\u2019s doing to listen to other points of view \u2013 especially the overwhelming vote of the House of Representatives and have some level of respect for that,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt shook him up, melted him down and he behaved accordingly.\u201d\n\n\"Very sad,\" she said. \"It was very sad,\" she said.\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, also in the meeting, said the subject of Trump's possible impeachment didn't come up but this was the first face-to-face meeting between her and Trump since she announced that the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry, which earlier in the day he called \"absolutely crazy.\"\n\nAs she has before, Pelosi said she prayed for the president, but this time she went a step further.\n\n\u201cI pray for his safety and that of his family, now we have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president,\u201d Pelosi said, later adding \u201cI\u2019m not saying mentally, I'm just talking about handling just handling the truth.\u201d\n\nShe also said she recalled Trump calling her a \"third-grade politician.\"\n\nLate Wednesday afternoon, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement blasting Pelosi.\n\n\"The President was measured, factual and decisive, while Speaker Pelosi\u2019s decision to walk out was baffling, but not surprising,\" Grisham said. \"She had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues. While Democratic leadership chose to storm out and get in front of the cameras to whine, everyone else in the meeting chose to stay in the room and work on behalf of this country.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans in the closed-door meeting also gave a very different version of what happened.\n\n\"I see a pattern of behavior with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She storms out of another meeting trying to make it unproductive. The other Democrats stayed and actually had a very productive meeting with the general from the Joint Chiefs, with the secretary of defense,\" McCarthy said.\n\nHe argued the meeting with Trump became more productive after the she left the room.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been in a lot of meetings where individuals get heated with one another. I do not believe in that process, that you should get up and you walk away. The other Democrats did not walk away. They stayed in the room, and you know what happened when Speaker Pelosi left the room? McCarthy said. \"They seemed pretty much calmer. It seemed much more productive. It seemed as though when the speaker was in the room, she was there for one reason and one reason only, and that\u2019s really unbecoming of a speaker.\"\n\nEarlier, Pelosi had tweeted that a classified full House briefing on Syria scheduled for Thursday afternoon had been canceled.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned that the White House has canceled an all-Member classified briefing on the dangerous situation the President has caused in Syria, denying the Congress its right to be informed as it makes decisions about our national security,\" she said.", "description": "Top Democrats walked out of a White House meeting on Syria Wednesday after they said President Donald Trump insulted them.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/pelosi-speaking-rt-jt-191016_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
