They have also been spotted in interstellar molecular clouds, or the vast, gaseous clouds that are strung between stars.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But it is still unclear how they might have formed, a question to which the answer could shed important light on how humanity and all other life on Earth was able to begin.\n\nTo conduct the experiment, the researchers used an ultra-high vacuum reaction chamber to create a simulation of the conditions inside of those huge gaseous clouds. They constantly sprinkled a gaseous mixture of water, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol onto a material made to simulate cosmic dust, which was cooled down to -263C, and then hit with lamps that could kick off chemical reactions.\n\nOut of that machine came an icy film that gathered on the simulation of the dust that was inside the chamber. When researchers warmed that up and then analysed it, they found those nucleobases that are required to create DNA and RNA, which are in turn required for life.\n\nThey also found other interesting materials, such as amino acids, which make up proteins.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that the processes we reproduced could lead to the formation of the molecular precursors of life,\" said Yasuhiro Oba in a statement. \"The results could improve our understanding of the early stages of chemical evolution in space.\n\nPrevious experiments might actually have created those nucleobases, the researchers said, but those conducting them did not have the highly precise measuring techniques to see that they were there.", "description": "The building blocks of life could have formed in vast, ancient clouds hanging between the stars, according to new research.
