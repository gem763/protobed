And it\u2019s really fucked up that we live in this era where you cannot make mistakes. Because I know that growing up, that\u2019s how I learned. I learned from mistakes.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo I should be allowed to make mistakes and learn from them, but this culture nowadays, they\u2019re like, man, if you mess up it\u2019s off with your head. And it\u2019s sad because I don\u2019t trust that you really know what you\u2019re doing, if you\u2019re that perfect and you don\u2019t make no mistakes. You have to allow someone to grow with the times. The way things were then aren\u2019t the way they are now. And the way things are now won\u2019t be the way they are in the future.\u201d\n\nDuring the conversation, Cole said that he approaches college campus engagements with some trepidation owing to the millennial generation\u2019s sensitivities.\n\n\u201cIf I decide to do a college, which is very, very, very rare, I just stay as P.C. as possible,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy point of view really isn\u2019t important. Let me just make them laugh the best way I can, but I\u2019m not trying to change the world. I\u2019m not trying to give my point of view on anything at any college at all. I\u2019m in and out. I just don\u2019t know about that generation being able to handle what I have to say. It\u2019s about me protecting their feelings and protecting myself.\u201d\n\nCole is the latest Hollywood figure to speak out against cancel culture \u2014 where left-wing political activists working in conjunction with the mainstream media apply social media pressure to get their targets and adversaries fired or deplatformed,\n\nPerformers including Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chappelle, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, and Marlon Wayans have all expressed loathing and misgivings about cancel culture and the destructive effect it has on the entertainment industry.\n\nSouth Park co-creator Matt Stone has also slammed cancel culture, laying blame at the feet of entertainment journalists who he believes took a hypocritical stance on Chappelle\u2019s latest Netflix show.\n\n\u201cThey may have laughed like hell at that, and then they went home and they know what they have to write to keep their job,\u201d Stone recently told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
