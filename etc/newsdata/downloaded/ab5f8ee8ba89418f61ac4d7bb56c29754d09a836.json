(MDSO) and that it has set new financial targets for 2019 due to the addition of the U.S. medical-software maker in its account.\n\nThe French software maker said the CFIUS clearance was one of the final conditions for the merger, which should be completed in the coming days.\n\nDassault Systemes set new goals for its full-year and fourth quarter due to the addition of Medidata. The company now expects its 2019 non-IFRS revenue to come between 4.02 billion and 4.06 billion euros ($4.47 billion-$4.52 billion), while non-IFRS revenue for its fourth quarter should range from EUR1.17 billion to EUR1.21 billion. Non-IFRS operating margin for 2019 should be around 32%, it says, while earnings-per-share growth should be between 13% and 14% in 2019.\n\nOn an IFRS basis, revenue for its third quarter rose 14% to EUR914.8 million from EUR804.5 million, Dassault said.\n\nDassault said Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) has selected its 3DExperience Platform to support digital-engineering initiatives, but it didn't specify the financial details of the deal.\n\nWrite to Olivia Bugault at olivia.bugault@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 01:48 ET (05:48 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
