(Photo: Andrew Meredith)\n\nMany Olympics host cities experience a spate of hotel openings in the run-up to the games. But even two years after the event, London's high-end hotel boom shows no sign of stopping, with several of the world's most exclusive brands launching outposts in the U.K. capital. Chiltern Street, Andre Balazs's first London property, is opening imminently (its restaurant, already up and running, is the hottest table in town), and the city's first Mondrian and Nobu hotels are coming in the next few months. This comes as the city welcomed nearly 17 million international visitors last year, a record for a one-year period. Meanwhile, here are some notable newcomers you can book now:\n\nShangri-La Hotel, At The Shard\n\nDesigned by noted architect Renzo Piano, the distinctive glass-clad spire of the Shard, Western Europe's tallest building, dominates the skyline near London Bridge and the Tate Modern. Perched between floors 34 and 52, the first U.K. Shangri-La offers stunning vistas over the city from each of its larger-than-average 185 rooms and 17 suites. All have the usual five-star touches like marble bathrooms, but the real luxury is the floor-to-ceiling windows with those bird's-eye views (binoculars are provided). The brand's Asian roots are apparent in Oriental decorative motifs and Asian-influenced menus, though the Ting Restaurant serves largely locally sourced Modern British food. Don't miss the remarkable infinity pool on the 52nd floor that suggests you're swimming off into the sky.\n\nHighlight: Panoramic views, high-rise infinity pool\n\nRates: $640\u2013$19,900\n\nInfo:shangri-la.com/london/shangrila\n\nAce Hotel London Shoreditch\n\nThe hipster's favorite hotel brand has opened its first European property in trendy Shoreditch, London's cross between New York's Williamsburg and Silicon Valley. The aesthetic is stripped-down industrial chic \u2014 gray carpets, monochrome walls, minibars in gray plastic trays \u2014 rather than traditional well-padded luxury. Instead, there are loads of curated media (the hotel employs a \"cultural engineer\" to choose the gallery exhibits as well as the DVD selection and vinyl LPs available to borrow) and in-house outlets for local businesses such as a juice bar, a (locally roasted) coffee bar, and a florist, plus extras such as tech workshops and bike tours of the area. There's also an excellent Modern British brasserie called Hoi Polloi. If you like the idea of a lobby filled with people hunched over Apple laptops by day and indie tunes spun by a DJ at night, the Ace is for you.\n\nHighlights: Access to local culture, high-tech amenities\n\nRates: $410-$680\n\nInfo:acehotel.com/london\n\nHam Yard Hotel\n\nThis latest stylish offering from hotelier couple Tim and Kit Kemp (their other properties include New York's Crosby Street Hotel) has been built from scratch around a new oak tree-filled courtyard that provides a quiet oasis behind the bustle of Piccadilly Circus and the theaters of Shaftsbury Avenue. Kit Kemp's signature textiles add color to the airy, loft-like public rooms, and to the 91 spacious bedrooms, where pale wood floors and neutral walls are enlivened by touches of fuchsia or lime green. There are also five apartment-like suites with kitchenettes and walk-in closets and a roof terrace with bar, olive trees, and kitchen garden for the hotel restaurant. Below ground there's a spa, a state-of-the-art cinema with 188 tangerine leather seats, and an original 1950s bowling alley imported from Texas (with its own bar and dance floor).\n\nHighlights: Stylish rooms, central location, retro bowling alley\n\nRates: $530-$5,970\n\nInfo:firmdalehotels.com/london/ham-yard-hotel\n\nThe London Edition\n\nFrom his earliest days co-owning the legendary Studio 54, Ian Schrager has known how to appeal to the fashionable and famous, and in this partnership with Marriott, he sprinkles some stardust over a brand usually noted for its unfussy appeal to business travelers. The Edition has retained the grand Belle \u00c9poque public rooms, all marble columns and spectacular ornate plasterwork, of the Edwardian hotel that formerly occupied this central London spot. The legacy is also commemorated in the name of the outstanding in-house restaurant, The Berners Tavern, supervised by noted chef Jason Atherton. The 153 rooms and 20 suites, by contrast, are restful, intimate shrines to minimalist luxury, decorated in shades of taupe with dark walnut or light oak paneling. There's also a cozy wood-paneled bar that evokes a country house library and a private members' nightclub that hotel guests can access.\n\nHighlights: Excellent restaurant, glamorous scene\n\nRates: $420-$8,100\n\nInfo:editionhotels.com\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/hotelcheckin/2014/05/23/new-london-hotels/9121963/", "description": "Many Olympics host cities experience a spate of hotel openings in the run-up to the games.
