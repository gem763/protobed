His team will also take into account his body\u2019s circadian rhythm.\n\nKipchoge arrived in the Austrian capital from his Kenyan training camp in Kaptagat on Tuesday morning, saying he was looking forward to \u201cshowing the world that no human is limited.\u201d\n\nThis is Kipchoge\u2019s second attempt at breaking the two-hour barrier, after coming up 25 seconds short in a similar event, Breaking2, at Italy\u2019s Formula One track in Monza in May 2017.\n\nJust like then, Saturday\u2019s finishing time will not be ratified by the IAAF as an official world record, because of variables such as pacemakers entering mid-race. That won\u2019t hurt Kipchoge too much as he owns the world record mark of 2:01:39 from the Berlin Marathon last year, when he knocked more than a minute off the previous record set by Dennis Kimetto.\n\nTo succeed at Saturday\u2019s challenge, Kipchoge will need to shave off more than 99 seconds, and nothing is being left to chance.\n\nA team of 41 pacers includes: Olympic 1,500-meter champion Matthew Centrowitz from the United States; Ethiopia\u2019s Selemon Barega, who won silver in the 5,000 at the world championships in Doha and holds this year\u2019s world leading time in the 3,000; and Uganda\u2019s Ronald Musagala, who won two 1,500 races on the Diamond League circuit this year.\n\nThey will help keep Kipchoge at pace on the flat and 4.3-kilometer straight course, which is for most parts protected from the wind by high trees and has large roundabouts at both ends, enabling to make turns without slowing down. In August, organizers made the surface of the park\u2019s road smoother than ever by giving it a new coating.\n\nTo make the conditions completely perfect, though, Kipchoge also wants a bit of noisy crowd support.\n\n\u201cOne element that is very important for Eliud is the crowd,\u201d the runner\u2019s coach Patrick Sang said, making an open plea for locals to come out \u201cand cheer him on to help him make history.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Eliud Kipchoge's family finally gets to see him at a marathon, it will likely be the fastest one the Olympic champion has ever run.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Willemsen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/athletics_kipchoge_2-hour_marathon_attempt_55968_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
