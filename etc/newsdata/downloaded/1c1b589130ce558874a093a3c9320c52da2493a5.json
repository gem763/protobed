I am glad to see that Wetherspoons have taken action and are supporting the charity\u2019s campaign following speaking up about the issue and I hope that they follow through with implementing their proposed changes, understanding and behaviours.\n\n\u2018Through my social media platform, I will continue to be transparent about living with a hidden disability and a stoma also in hope that eventually, society thinks inclusively of everybody.\u2019\n\nThey\u2019re the first major pub chain to sign up to the charity\u2019s Not Every Disability is Visible campaign, which aims to stop the stigma and discrimination towards people with hidden health conditions.\n\nA survey found that half of people with conditions said they have felt prevented from going to restaurants (49%) and pubs (43%) because they fear discrimination.\n\nThe hidden illness means people look fine on the outside but they suffer from frequent diarrhoea and an urgent need to go to the bathroom. Some, like Amber, also have ostomy bags, where waste is collected in a bag outside the body, and need to use the bathroom to empty the bag.\n\nWhilst someone may look \u2018okay\u2019 on the outside, they may crucially need to use the accessible toilets, due to symptoms such as urgent and frequent diarrhoea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charity launched the campaign in April and say they have sent over 48,000 emails to the 15 largest pub and restaurant chains across the country but JD Wetherspoon leading the way as the first chain to come on board with the campaign.\n\nThey will put signs in all bathrooms and train staff to help them better understand invisible conditions.\n\nThe charity said over 80% of people with Crohn\u2019s or Colitis said they feel more comfortable visiting places with the Not Every Disability is Visible signs installed, powerfully demonstrating that these signs have a real impact on people\u2019s lives.\n\nSarah Sleet, Chief Executive at Crohn\u2019s & Colitis UK said: \u2018JD Wetherspoon has made a simple but significant change in minimising the impact Crohn\u2019s and Colitis can have on people\u2019s lives \u2013 we know that these signs make a real difference to people living with these devastating conditions.\n\n\u2018We are grateful to the company for joining our campaign and showing their commitment to tackling stigma and discrimination for all their customers.\u201d\n\nWetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: \u2018We want to make sure all of our customers feel comfortable when visiting any of our pubs. We\u2019re delighted to install these new signs that help to both increase awareness that not all disabilities are visible, and to ensure that anyone who needs to, can feel confident using our accessible toilets.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: 9 ways to keep your dog safe and stress free on Bonfire Night\n\nMORE: There\u2019s a bank that gives out ice cream with an ATM that dispenses free toppings\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Pub chain first to install signs about invisible illnesses and disabilities after Crohn's & Colitis UK campaign.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NEDIV-Collage-89ad_1571930549.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
