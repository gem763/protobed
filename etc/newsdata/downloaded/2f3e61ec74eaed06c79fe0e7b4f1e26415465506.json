Party officials, who for months have been playing to Trump supporters\u2019 distaste of the left through a merchandising effort, are convinced the inquiry could turn into a cash windfall \u2014 and not just for Trump himself.\n\nMost of the proceeds of Tuesday\u2019s fundraising drive will benefit Trump\u2019s campaign. But the effort was partly aimed at Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, one of a swelling group of freshmen Democrats who represent districts Trump carried in 2016 and have come out in support of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Republican officials hope the site will finally enable them to compete with the Democratic small dollar juggernaut ActBlue, which raked in around $1.6 billion during the 2018 midterms.\n\nRepublicans had long lacked a centralized apparatus that allowed them to engage in the kind of digital fundraising they did on Tuesday. The appeal allowed givers to evenly split their donations \u2014 a process known as conduit fundraising \u2014 to Trump and the Slotkin\u2019s GOP opponent with a click of the mouse.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nSlotkin and dozens of other House Democrats benefited from similar programs in the 2018 election, when donors around the country socked away money in online \u201cnominee funds\u201d during big moments like the attempted Obamacare repeals of 2017. The next year, those funds disbursed hundreds of thousands of dollars each to swing-district Democratic primary winners.\n\nOver the coming days, WinRed is expected to launch fundraising campaigns targeting nearly a dozen other House Democrats from pro-Trump districts who have come out in favor of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe fundraising push is partly designed to win over wary House Republicans who are skeptical of WinRed and believe party leadership is trying to foist it upon them. Just over half of House GOP incumbents, 56 percent, have adopted the system since it was unveiled in late June \u2014 a far lower rate than Senate Republicans and state parties, according to a memo WinRed released this week.\n\nSlotkin, who hails from a Lansing-area district and served in a range of intelligence-related positions before running for Congress, was one of seven first-term Democrats from swing districts to co-author a Washington Post op-ed announcing support for impeachment over revelations that the president allegedly pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son.", "description": "A fundraising drive from Trump and the RNC netted a million dollars Tuesday.", "authors": ["Alex Isenstadt"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/67/1f/80d39f5643bcac6eba0cf2f45f8a/190924-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
