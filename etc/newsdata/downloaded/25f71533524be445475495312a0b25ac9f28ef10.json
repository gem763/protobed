It wasn\u2019t considered beautiful, worthwhile.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe series encouraged Tamil people to share images of themselves to honour their heritage.\n\nSinthujan wanted to address discrimination against Tamils (Picture: Sinthujan Varatharajah)\n\nSinthujan, who says \u2018Tamil\u2019 has almost become a swear word, grew up in the UK, where he felt the effects of discrimination.\n\nHe adds: \u2018I started a discussion on it on Instagram in which people shared their experiences of discrimination based on anti-Tamil racism and internalised anti-Tamilness.\n\n\u2018It was my way of assembling and archiving the collective and structural nature of such forms of racism, which you\u2019ll hardly read about or even hear about.\n\n\u2018I want other Tamils to know that we\u2019ve no reason to feel ashamed to look the way we do. We are beautiful the way we are.\u2019\n\nThe replies from other Tamil people poured in (Picture: @ _indu_/Instagram )\n\nSinthujan added that Tamils are often excluded from the South Asian narrative, often feeling like the \u2018stepchild\u2019. He is also not optimistic about representation in mainstream media as a whole, feeling it\u2019s superficial.\n\nHe reckons social media does a better job of representing people than traditional media.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have any reason to be optimistic considering how slow changes are and how little there is actually done to address it beyond surface discussions and feel-good campaigns.\n\n\u2018Social media is where some ruptures are happening. But even social media mostly reproduces the same visuals and stereotypes.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe images have elicited a strong reaction on social media where users have said they feel seen.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never felt less alone and more proud than when scrolling through this thread,\u2019 wrote one person.\n\nAnother wrote: \u2018It\u2019s incredibly heartwarming and pride-inducing to see the many ways we look. We\u2019re beautiful, resilient, brave, and worthy\u2019.\n\nHere are some more of the beautiful pictures shared in the series:\n\nFollowers said the images were \u2018heartwarming\u2019 (Picture: @suntharv/Instagram )\n\nSinthujan feels that there is Anti-Tamil sentiment in the Asian community (Picture: Ruvin De Silva)\n\nProducer and director Thurka Gunaratnam pictured (Picture: @Sharanguru)\n\nSome people feel being Tamil is like being a \u2018stepchild\u2019 to other South Asians (Picture: Thushaa Lalita)\n\nTamil and proud (Picture: Julian Bell )\n\nThere\u2019s great diversity among the group (Picture: Tharsiha)\n\nMORE: Punjabi and diaspora communities in the West Midlands are celebrated in new exhibition\n\nMORE: Stunning photos show men\u2019s beauty pageant contestants decked out in national dress\n\nMORE: Photo series helps women with acne break down the stigma of living with a skin condition\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sinthujan Varatharajah shared stories of Tamil people - one of the largest and oldest groups from India and Sri Lanka.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tamil-pride_1570356454.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
