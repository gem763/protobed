Or there was, long ago, and now it's found in isolated pockets. The past 20+ years of Mars missions from NASA, ESA, and other space agencies have pointed to a world that was once warm and wet, and is now cold and dry.\n\nNow that we know Mars once had water, though, we're unlocking deeper questions like \"when\" and \"for how long.\" A new discovery reported today in Nature Geoscience gives a glimpse into the watery past of Mars\u2014and may point to when the world began to dry out.\n\nWhat Was Discovered?\n\nPhoto credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech More\n\nThe Curiosity rover is exploring the Gale Crater region of Mars, which is widely believed to be an ancient lakebed, a case that's been further bolstered by evidence gathered by the rover.\n\nThe new results come from the upper Murray formation, which has outcroppings on which mission scientists can actually see sedimentary layers. This makes it a perfect place to really see how Mars changed over time.\n\nThe particular materials in the new study had a high concentration of sulfate salts. They were in greater abundance than other materials sampled thus far, meaning they come from a very particular era in the history of Mars\u2014the late Hesperian era.\n\nWhat Is the Hesperian?\n\nThe Hesperian era was a time, starting around 3.7 billion years ago, when Mars had active volcanoes and plenty of water in shallow seas and lakes. The exact end date isn't well constrained, but the paper points to around 3.3 billion years ago.\n\nThe Hesperian drew to an end when Mars lost its atmosphere, which made it harder to hold onto its seas and lakes. Some of them froze, and exist today as underground glaciers. There may even be some underground lakes that are still liquid. But a lot of the once-abundant water on the planet evaporated away as Mars' climate grew more and more inhospitable.\n\nWhere Does This Sample Fit In?\n\nThe high concentration of salts points to a time of rapid evaporation. In other words, the sample is coming from the end of the Hesperian, when Mars began the transition to the cold desert we know today. The world was likely dotted with saline lakes clinging on during a time of atmospheric loss and may have been some of the last surface waters on Mars.\n\nHow Did Mars Lose Its Atmosphere?", "description": "Curiosity discovered salty deposits that point to a time when the atmosphere was in decline\u2014and it was taking the seas along with it.", "authors": ["John Wenz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wW3KTOQonS_Z3NpkcVERwQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/692b15336ccfbd9624b475dbb72dd003", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
