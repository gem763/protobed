China is breeding GIANT pigs as big as polar bears to cope with a pork shortage", "language": "en", "text": "A Chinese farmer is said to have bred a giant pig the size of a polar bear as part of efforts to cope with the pork shortage in the country following a devastating outbreak of African swine fever.\n\nThe super sized swine weighs more than 1,100 pounds and could fetch owner Pang Cong up to $1,399 at market - more than three times the average monthly disposable income where he lives in Nanning, Bloomberg reports.\n\nIt's part of a growing move to produce bigger pigs as China, the world's largest pork consumer, looks to fix its shortage of the meat. In Jilin the average hog now weighs 385 pounds to 440 pounds, compared to the the normal 275 pounds.\n\nThe country\u2019s top pig breeder, Wens Foodstuffs Group Co, is also said to be trying to increase the average size of their animals too.\n\nChina is said to be breeding Ggiant pigs as big as polar bears that weigh more than 1,100 pounds to cope with a pork shortage after a swine fever outbreak (stock image)\n\nChina, the world's largest pork consumer, looks to fix its shortage of the meat with giant pigs. Pork prices surged in August from a year earlier, hitting consumers hard (stock image)\n\nFarmer Zhao Hailin said they want pigs 'as big as possible'. One expert, Lin Guofa, said the average weight at some larger farms is now around 310 pounds compared to the previous norm of around 240lbs.\n\nThe Chinese government had already announced a nationwide initiative to boost pork production following a price spike blamed on a devastating outbreak of African swine fever.\n\nThey said they will take steps to accelerate the revival of hog production, prevent and control African swine fever and upgrade farms to further ensure pork supply and stable prices.\n\n'We are confident and capable of rising to the challenge, dissolving the risks and doing well in keeping prices in the pig market stable,' Peng Shaozong of the National Development and Reform Commission said last month.\n\nHe said government agencies will closely monitor and analyze pork prices, stabilize production and regulate the market price.\n\nPork prices surged 46.7% in August from a year earlier, contributing 1.08 percentage points to a 2.8 percent rise in the consumer price index, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics in September.\n\nThe soaring price has hit Chinese consumers hard as pork, essential in most Chinese households, accounts for more than 60% of meat consumption.\n\nA worker feeds pigs at a farm in Xibaishan village in Hebei province, China, in August 2018. China\u2019s hog herd fell by half in the first eight months of 2019 due to a devastating outbreak of African swine fever, according to experts\n\nChina raises about half of the world's pigs, and stable pork production is of great importance to people's well-being and a steady national economic performance, said Yu Kangzhen, vice minister of agriculture and rural affairs.\n\nThe implementation of these policies will play a powerful role in mobilizing farmers, promoting breeding and ensuring the pork supply in the market, he said.\n\nPork production fell as African swine fever ravaged pig farms in China beginning in April. While the disease doesn't infect humans, it spreads among pigs quickly.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua said the situation was 'extremely severe'.", "description": "The super sized swine  could fetch its owner Pang Cong up to $1,399 at market - more than three times the average monthly disposable income where he lives in Nanning (stock images).", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19374708-0-image-a-8_1570403458263.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
