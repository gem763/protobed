Kallie Bender, who was born at 25 weeks gestation, weighed just 13 ounces at birth, and was facing a heart defect, Fox 10 Phoenix reported.\n\n\u201cThe scariest thing for me, to know if she was born and if she was even smaller than the 13 ounces, [was] what her survival chances were,\u201d Ebonie Bender, Kallie\u2019s mother, said in a news conference.\n\nBABY BORN WITH RARE HEART TUMOR TO SEEK SURGERY IN US: 'EVERY DAY IS AN UNKNOWN,' MOM SAYS\n\nIt all started when Bender went for a 25-week ultrasound which revealed that there was no fluid surrounding Kallie in her mother\u2019s womb. They then found that a condition Bender had was reducing blood flow and nutrients to the baby, and determined she had to be delivered, Fox 10 Phoenix reported.\n\nBabies born before 37 weeks gestation are called preterm or premature, with those born before 28 weeks of pregnancy considered extremely preterm, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Babies born between 23 weeks and 25 weeks of pregnancy may face serious complications or disabilities, but Kallie's doctors said she shows no signs of neurological delay thus far.\n\nKallie was born on May 24, and began her 150-day NICU stay at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center. For the procedure to address Kallie's heart defect, doctors warned Bender that the breathing and feeding tubes might not be small enough to fit Kallie\u2019s tiny body. Even the NICU\u2019s tiniest diapers were too big for Kallie.\n\nBABY BORN WITH AMNIOTIC SAC INTACT, PHOTOS SHOW\n\n\u201cThey explained to her right away, there\u2019s good days and bad days,\u201d Bender told Fox 10 Phoenix.\n\nKallie, who has two older brothers waiting for her at home, was finally able to be held by her parents after 37 days.\n\n\u201cBeing educated helped us to stay more calm,\" Dameon Bender, Kallie\u2019s father, said in a news conference. \"Each day was a new journey and we were super excited for it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKallie, who now weighs about 7 pounds, was sent home with an oxygen tank and feeding tube, but doctors are confident she will outgrow both, Fox 10 Phoenix reported.", "description": "She was born weighing just 13 ounces.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/22/694940094001_6096782256001_6096783550001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
