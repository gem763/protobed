The people of Northern Ireland will be in charge of the laws that they live by, and \u2013 unlike the backstop \u2013 will have the right to end the special arrangement if they so choose. #GetBrexitDone #TakeBackControl \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 17, 2019\n\nThe Prime Minister tweeted it removes the \u201canti-democratic\u201d Irish backstop.\n\nThe case will be heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said under the new agreement Northern Ireland would be part of the UK\u2019s customs territory, not the EU\u2019s, but would \u201cremain an entry point\u201d into the EU single market and aligned to some EU rules on goods.\n\nThis means they must be checked on entry to the island of Ireland, rather than border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nMr Maugham, whose legal team earlier took legal action to try to prevent a no-deal Brexit by ensuring the Prime Minister obeys by the Benn Act, is seeking a court order, or interdict, banning the Government from putting the new deal before Parliament for a vote on Saturday.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cWe do not understand how the Government might have come to negotiate a Withdrawal Agreement in terms that breach amendments tabled by its own European Research Group.\n\n\u201cUnless and until Section 55 is repealed by the UK Parliament, it is simply not open, as a matter of law, for the United Kingdom to enter into such an agreement.\u201d\n\nHe said if the court rules the new deal is \u201cunlawful\u201d, the Government will have to request a Brexit extension.\n\nMr Maugham added: \u201cIf the Government wants to seek Parliament\u2019s consent to repeal section 55, it can and should seek that consent.\n\n\u201cBut it must not negotiate unlawful trade deals and then present them to Parliament as a fait accompli.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the new deal on Thursday, Mr Johnson tweeted: \u201cWe will leave the EU\u2019s Customs Union as one United Kingdom and be able to strike trade deals all around the world.\u201d", "description": "Campaigners argue the new deal struck between the Government and the EU contravenes existing law on customs arrangements.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/02/wire-19866334-1571363354-818_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
