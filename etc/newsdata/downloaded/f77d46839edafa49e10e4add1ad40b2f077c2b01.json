In response, they issued non-binding safety recommendations to the FAA.\n\nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said that the NTSB recommendations suggest that in designing and certifying the 737 MAX Boeing and the FAA, \"may not have made realistic assumptions about how pilots respond to multiple simultaneous and potentially confusing warnings in emergency situations.\"\n\nThe path to certification\n\nThe FAA has been working with Boeing, international authorities, the aviation industry and a team of technical experts to return the Boeing 737 MAX to service.\n\nIn June, Boeing announced that they completed development of the updated software for the 737 MAX, along with engineering test flights.\n\n(MORE: Boeing to start paying more than $144K each to families of Max 737 crash victims)\n\nBoeing then worked to address FAA requests for additional information on the system architecture, detailing how pilots interact with the airplane controls and displays in different flight scenarios.\n\nOnce the FAA completes their review and schedules test flights, Boeing will submit final certification documents.\n\nFederal regulators have not yet set a date for certification flights, but in an interview with ABC News last month, the head of the FAA, Stephen Dickson, said that no U.S. commercial carrier will fly the Boeing 737 MAX until he is \"completely assured\" that it is safe to do so.\n\n\"I'm not going to certify this plane until I'm satisfied,\" he said.", "description": "American Airlines announced in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday that it will start flying the troubled Boeing 737 MAX aircraft on Jan. 16.
