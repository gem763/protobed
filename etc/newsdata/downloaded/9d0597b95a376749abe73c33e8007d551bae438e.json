(Alberto Pizzoli/Agence France-Presse)\n\nA good sign that the Wall Street Journal was accurate in reporting that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on a call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was the lack of denial from the White House. The White House and the president deny true things all the time, but generally around the edges \u2014 as when press secretary Stephanie Grisham tried to claim that Trump hadn\u2019t urged Zelensky to work with his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani because \u201cZelensky mentioned [Giuliani] first.\u201d\n\nAfter the Pompeo report, though? Nothing. No \u201cfake news!!\u201d tweet from Trump; nothing from Grisham suggesting that the Journal was bent on Trump\u2019s destruction. And, sure enough, on Wednesday, Pompeo admitted his participation on the call.\n\nWhen the Journal story broke, it came as a surprise. A complaint filed by an intelligence community whistleblower mentioned that they\u2019d been told that a senior State Department staff member was on the call, but not Pompeo himself. So when Pompeo was asked about the call after it became public knowledge, he knew something no one else did: He was privy to it in real time.\n\n[Trump impeachment inquiry]\n\nThat was not information he revealed when asked about the issue. Instead, he offered a master class in misleading the public without technically saying anything untrue.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sept. 22 \u2014 before the White House had released a rough transcript of the call \u2014 host Martha Raddatz raised the issue of the whistleblower complaint and the call with Pompeo.\n\n\u201cThe Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump pressed the president of Ukraine eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son,\u201d Raddatz said. \u201cWhat do you know about those conversations?\u201d\n\nThe honest answer is that Pompeo knew a lot, having been on the phone. That\u2019s not what Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cSo, you just gave me a report about a I.C. whistleblower complaint, none of which I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Pompeo replied. That appears to be true: He hadn\u2019t yet seen the complaint. But, of course, he didn\u2019t need to have seen the complaint to say what he knew about the conversations.\n\n\u201cI can tell you about this administration\u2019s policies with Ukraine,\u201d Pompeo pivoted. He transitioned to disparaging how the administration of Barack Obama handled Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see President Zelensky this week,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe want a good relationship with the Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say you know nothing about this, but let me ask you this question,\u201d Raddatz pressed. \u201cThe Ukrainian presidential readout of the conversation said they discussed \u2014 quote \u2014 \u2018investigation of corruption cases which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u2019 The president tweeted Saturday: \u2018It was a perfectly fine and respectful conversation.\u2019 Do you think it\u2019s \u2014 quote \u2014 \u2018perfectly fine\u2019 to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I saw a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister yesterday, said there was no pressure applied in the course of the conversation,\u201d Pompeo said. Again: He knows what happened on the call but relies on a statement from Ukraine to bolster his point. (That statement, incidentally, should be taken with a grain of salt.)\n\nPompeo then pivoted again, this time to insinuate improper behavior by former vice president Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cIf the conversation was perfectly fine, as President Trump said,\u201d Raddatz continued, \u201cwhy not release the transcript or a portion to the public?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House will have to explain,\u201d Pompeo said, this time putting it on his boss to deal with questions about what happened. \u201cWe don\u2019t release transcripts very often. It\u2019s the rare case. Those are private conversations between world leaders. And it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to do so, except in the most extreme circumstances.\u201d\n\nThen, for the first time, he said something that would specifically suggest that he was as unaware of what happened on the call as anyone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that that would be appropriate here at this point,\u201d he said.\n\nRaddatz, of course, didn\u2019t know to press Pompeo because there was no reason to assume that he was on the call. Pompeo knew that he was, and he carefully avoided volunteering that information. The interview ended.\n\nPompeo was also asked about the Ukraine situation on Sept. 26, after the rough transcript and the whistleblower complaint had been released.\n\n\u201cMr. Giuliani has said that the State Department instructed him to get involved with Ukraine, to reach out to President Zelensky and his aides. Is that correct?\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cAnd if so, what exactly was he told to do by the State Department, by whom? And just more broadly, the whistleblower complaint does not appear to suggest any allegation of impropriety from people in the State Department. Is that correct? Are you confident that none of your staff \u2014 that you or none or your staff did anything improper in this whole situation?\u201d\n\nThe problem here is obvious at the outset. During press availabilities, each reporter has a lot of questions they would like to have answered but generally get only one opportunity to ask anything. So there\u2019s a temptation to ask a lot of things, assuming, perhaps, that the official being questioned will walk through each one. Instead, officials tend to pick out the one they most want to answer.\n\nWhich is what Pompeo did here.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to actually read the whistleblower complaint yet,\u201d Pompeo said, replying only to the question about what the complaint itself suggested. \u201cI read the first couple of paragraphs and then got busy today. But I\u2019ll ultimately get a chance to see it. If I understand it right, it\u2019s from someone who had secondhand knowledge.\u201d\n\nIf only someone with firsthand knowledge of the call were available to answer the reporter\u2019s question!\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ll say this morning about the engagement of the State Department,\u201d he continued. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, so from what I\u2019ve seen so far, each of the actions that were undertaken by State Department officials was entirely appropriate and consistent with the objective that we\u2019ve had certainly since this new government has come into office.\u201d He continued on, praising his department and outlining broad foreign policy goals.\n\nNote that bit of self-exoneration: \u201ceach of the actions that were undertaken by State Department officials was entirely appropriate.\u201d\n\nPompeo probably wasn\u2019t actually giving a little wink to his own role, but, seeing the comment now, it certainly could be read that way.", "description": "The secretary of state created a false impression using true statements.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MoC-e-wSfxmenvjWdlwpVuURKvg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TO5SJWHFBAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
