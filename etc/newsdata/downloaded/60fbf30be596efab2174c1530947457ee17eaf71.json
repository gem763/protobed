He was caught after he allegedly used a recording device to view someone in the bathroom without their knowledge.\n\n\"Nickey Stane is every woman's nightmare,\" Fresno County District Attorney Lisa Smittcamp said. \"He appears to be a regular person and he is a sexual predator who has terrorized women throughout this valley.\"\n\nStane is also the \"primary suspect\" in the 1996 murder and rape of Debbie Dorian, but has not yet been charged and authorities are still gathering evidence, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said.\n\nVisalia Police Department\n\nDorian's body was found by her father. She had been bound, gagged, and raped, according to Dyer.\n\nDNA found at the scene was a match to DNA in one of the sexual assaults in Visalia, according to police.\n\nThe DNA from Visalia was collected at a bus stop, where a woman said a man wearing a hood took out a gun and told her he would kill her if she ran, according to KSFN. He then fondled her breasts and walked away.\n\nPolice have charged Stane in that case and two others, according to court documents. He has pleaded not guilty to the eight felony charges he faces, including sexual battery by restraint and kidnapping to commit another crime.\n\n\u201c \u201d Nickey Stane is every woman's nightmare.\n\nDyer applauded the judge's handling the case for not allowing Stane to be released.\n\nThe technology used in Stane's case was the same technology used to catch the Golden State Killer.\n\nStane faces more than 70 years to life in prison if convicted of the eight felony charges in Tulare County. He's currently being held at the Tulare County jail with no bail.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if he has retained a lawyer.", "description": "Nicky Stane, an alleged sexual predator, has been caught thanks to DNA technology.
