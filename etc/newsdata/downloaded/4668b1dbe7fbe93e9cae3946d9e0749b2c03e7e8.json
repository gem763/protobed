USA TODAY\n\nJalen Hurts has a very real chance to make college football history as one of the top-3 Heisman Trophy favorites after Week 8.\n\nShould he beat out LSU's Joe Burrow, Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa and the rest of the field in December, he would make Oklahoma the first program to have three consecutive Heisman winners \u2014 and with three different quarterbacks, all of whom transferred in. Following Baker Mayfield in 2017 and Kyler Murray in 2018, Hurts would also be the Sooners' eighth winner overall.\n\nAs a grad transfer from Alabama, Hurts is thriving with his new team and putting up some ridiculous numbers \u2014 even when he's not having his best performance \u2014 particularly against Big 12 defenses that have absolutely no idea how to slow this dynamic quarterback down. He's coach Lincoln Riley's third passer in three years, and that powerhouse offense not only helped Mayfield and Murray put up huge enough numbers to win the Heisman but also led to both being No. 1 NFL draft picks.\n\nNow, we won't know if Hurts keeps that tradition going for a while, but statistically, how does his Heisman campaign compare with Mayfield's and Murray's successful ones?\n\nHere's a look at how Hurts' stats for the Sooners' first seven games of the season match up with Mayfield's and Murray's through the same number of games.\n\nThere are 16 key categories to compare, ranging from Oklahoma's record to their highest and lowest passer efficiency ratings. Another important metric we're including is total quarterback rating, which, as ESPN notes, is still on a scale from one to 100, but it adjusts the raw QBR to consider the quality of defenses faced and \"efficiency associated with throwing the ball, running the ball, drawing penalties, and avoiding sacks and turnovers\" within the context of downs, field position, the score and time on the clock.\n\nSTAFF PICKS: LSU, Ohio State face major tests at home\n\nMORE: Bold predictions for Week 9 in college football\n\nIMPACT GAMES: Five matchups that will shape the playoff race\n\nJalen Hurts, 2019 Heisman candidate\n\nJalen Hurts' stats for the Sooners' first seven games of the season match up with Baker Mayfield's and Kyler Murray's through the same number of games.\n\nRecord through 7 games: 7-0\n\nRanked opponents played: No. 11 Texas\n\nCompletion percentage: 74.03 percent\n\nPassing yards: 2,074\n\nPassing TDs: 20\n\nPassing yards/game: 296.29\n\nInterceptions: 3\n\nSacks: 5\n\nRushing: 84 carries for 705 yards\n\nRushing TDs: 10\n\nRushing yards/game: 100.71\n\nTotal yards: 2,779\n\nTotal TDs: 30\n\nTotal QBR high/low: 99.0 (W vs. UCLA, W vs. Texas Tech)/79.4 (W vs. Texas)\n\nGames with total QBR 95.0+: 4\n\nPasser efficiency rating high/low: 308.5 (W vs. West Virginia)/155.9 (W vs. Texas)\n\nJalen Hurts had five times as many TDs as incompletions. That seems good.\n\n\n\nRecap \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/nLC1luJ1vbpic.twitter.com/IyV1NGOUdF \u2014 Oklahoma Football (@OU_Football) October 19, 2019\n\nHurts is killing it. His best game was in Week 8 in Oklahoma's 52-14 thrashing of West Virginia. He was nearly perfect, completing 16-of-17 passes for 316 yards and three passing touchdowns while adding 75 yards on the ground and two more rushing touchdowns.\n\nFans will easily recall his worst game so far, which was against Texas when he fumbled and threw his third interception of the season in the first half. Oklahoma still won, 34-27, and Hurts still finished with four total touchdowns. But his completion percentage hit a season-low at 57.1 percent.\n\nCompared with Mayfield and Murray through seven games, Hurts has an edge over Oklahoma's last two quarterbacks in a few categories, including completion percentage and rushing yards and touchdowns. The latter is not a huge surprise when compared with Mayfield \u2014 who averaged only slightly more than 24 yards on the ground \u2014 but Hurts is running more than Murray did while keeping pace with his passing game.\n\nHurts currently has a 74.03 completion percentage; Mayfield's was 73.76 percent and Murray's was 72.33 percent. Hurts has only taken five sacks while Mayfield and Murray had 12 and eight, respectively, by this point in the season. Hurts has a better peak passer efficiency rating than Mayfield, but his lowest one is worse than that of both former Sooners.\n\nBut twice Hurts' total QBR was 99.0 and he tied Murray with four games with a rating of at least 95.0, and Mayfield only had two.\n\nRAMBOOOO \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\n\n\n\nJalen Hurts finds Charleston Rambo on yet another deep completion for @OU_Football. pic.twitter.com/wNZ7eqsIK7 \u2014 FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) September 28, 2019\n\nAnd on the ground, the Alabama transfer is blowing them away, which, again, is hardly surprising compared with Mayfield. But Hurts is proving to be a better runner than Murray with 10 touchdowns and 705 rushing yards while averaging more than 100 yards on the ground per game. Through seven games, Murray was still awfully impressive with 428 rushing yards, five touchdowns and a 61.14 average, but Hurts is on another level.\n\nBaker Mayfield, 2017 Heisman winner\n\nBaker Mayfield celebrates beating Texas in the Red River Showdown.\n\nRecord through 7 games: 6-1 (L vs. Iowa State)\n\nRanked opponents played: No. 2 Ohio State\n\nCompletion percentage: 73.76 percent\n\nPassing yards: 2,347\n\nPassing TDs: 19\n\nPassing yards/game: 335.29\n\nInterceptions: 2\n\nSacks: 12\n\nRushing: 48 carries for 170 yards\n\nRushing TDs: 3\n\nRushing yards/game: 24.29\n\nTotal yards: 2,517\n\nTotal TDs: 22\n\nTotal QBR high/low: 96.1 (W vs. UTEP)/80.7 (W vs. Texas)\n\nGames with total QBR 95.0+: 2\n\nPasser efficiency rating high/low: 282.7 (W vs. UTEP)/170.6 (L vs. Iowa State)\n\nKyler Murray, 2018 Heisman winner\n\nKyler Murray gave Oklahoma its second straight Heisman-winning quarterback last season.\n\nRecord through 7 games: 6-1 (L vs. No. 19 Texas)\n\nRanked opponents played: No. 19 Texas\n\nCompletion percentage: 72.33 percent\n\nPassing yards: 1,977\n\nPassing TDs: 25\n\nPassing yards/game: 282.43\n\nInterceptions: 3\n\nSacks: 8\n\nRushing: 66 carries for 428 yards\n\nRushing TDs: 5\n\nRushing yards/game: 61.14\n\nTotal yards: 2,405\n\nTotal TDs: 30\n\nTotal QBR high/low: 99.6 (W vs. FAU)/89.6 (W vs. UCLA)\n\nGames with total QBR 95.0+: 4\n\nPasser efficiency rating high/low: 348.0 (W vs. Baylor)/159.4 (W vs. UCLA)\n\nFar less of a runner than Hurts or Murray, Mayfield still had a higher yards per game average (335.29) and fewer interceptions. And Murray has the advantage with 25 passing touchdowns and the best peak total QBR. But Hurts has 262 total yards more than Mayfield and 374 more than Murray through seven games.\n\nokay so this Kyler Murray to Ceedee Lamb connection is getting outta hand \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/wOvIv34lPB \u2014 FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) September 8, 2018\n\nIt's also worth noting that Oklahoma currently leads the country in total offense with 612.9 yards per game and 50.4 points per game. Similarly, in 2017 and 2018, Mayfield and Murray helped the Sooners finish with the No. 1 offenses with 579.6 yards and 570.3 yards per game, respectively.\n\nOf course, there are other factors to consider \u2014 like the talent pool among wide receivers, varying offensive lines or Riley's development as a coach \u2014 that can have a huge impact on these numbers. And it's not like Hurts is guaranteed to win the Heisman if his numbers end up being better than Mayfield's and Murray's. Even if his stats are favorable compared with them, Burrow's or Tagovailoa's (or someone else's) could be better.\n\nPlus, only once in the first five years of the College Football Playoff has the Heisman winner not been on a playoff team \u2014 Lamar Jackson won in 2016 when Louisville finished 9-4 \u2014 so Hurts will likely keep his team on track to be among the final four as well, regardless of his stats.\n\nBut if he continues at this pace with absurd passing and rushing numbers, he's practically guaranteed to be a Heisman finalist \u2014 if not the ultimate winner.\n\nFollow For The Win's Michelle R.
