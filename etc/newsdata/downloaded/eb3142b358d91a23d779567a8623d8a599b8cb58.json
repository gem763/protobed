But, while the Italian\u2019s back-five may be hard to break down, the individual quality of the home side should eventually shine though, despite a wavering start to this season.\n\nBarcelona 2-0 Inter Milan\n\nTeam News\n\nLionel Messi is expected to miss out with an adductor problem, however, the Argentinian may be able to make the bench. Ousmane Dembele is also returning from injury and has only recently returned to training meaning he is unlikely to feature.\n\nInter boast an injury-free squad with Alexis Sanchez expected to make the starting line-up after scoring twice before being sent off against Sampdoria last week.\n\nPredicted Line-ups:\n\nBarcelona: Ter Stegen; Semedo, Pique, Lenglet, Firpo; Busquets, Arthur, De Jong; Griezmann, Perez, Suarez.\n\nInter: Handanovic; D\u2019Ambrosio, Godin, De Vrij, Skriniar, Asamoah, Sensi, Brozovic, Barella; Sanchez, Lukaku.\n\nWhen is it?\n\nKick-off at the Camp Nou is at 8pm (BST) on Wednesday 2 October.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nThe match will be broadcast live on BT Sport ESPN and can be streamed live online via the BT app and website.\n\nOdds\n\nBarcelona 1/2\n\nDraw 10/3\n\nInter 5/1", "description": "Barcelona host Inter Milan at the Nou Camp to bring back memories of their famous tie from 2010.
