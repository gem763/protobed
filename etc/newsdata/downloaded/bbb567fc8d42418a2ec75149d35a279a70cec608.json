The SAHRC said it hoped the legal action would provide clarity.\n\n\"Despite guidance having been provided by international human rights bodies confirming that the right is guaranteed to all persons irrespective of documented or legal status, the current legal system in South Africa does not provide adequate protection to such learners,\" it said in a statement.\n\n'Term 'undocumented' often misperceived'\n\n\"Human rights are guaranteed to all persons by virtue of the fact that they are human, and the exclusion of children from accessing a basic education would have devastating implications, not only on the individuals concerned, but on the country and the region as a whole.\"\n\nSAHRC commissioner Andr\u00e9 Gaum and research advisor Eden Esterhuizen said in February that the debate around undocumented pupils in South Africa often centred around migration.\n\n\"The term 'undocumented' is often misperceived as a consequence of irregular migration, where, in fact, the lack of documentation affects South Africans without birth certificates, stateless people, as well as undocumented migrants,\" they said.\n\nThey explained that most pupils adversely affected by a lack of documentation were poor, black pupils from predominantly rural areas.\n\n\"So even where an argument is made around the need to comply with immigration laws, or to put measures in place to stop schools from artificially inflating pupil numbers to receive additional funding, the state\u2019s current position on the matter, quite frankly, has failed to take key considerations into account,\" they said.\n\nThe case is expected to be heard in September.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
