What\u2019s more, about 12% of preventable patient harm results in \u201cprolonged, permanent disability\u201d or even death.\n\nLead study author Maria Panagioti and her co-authors conducted a meta-analysis of international data from 70 studies involving 337,025 patients, finding the same results across the U.S. and Europe.\n\nThe largest share of this preventable harm, they found, was related to medication and other treatments.\n\nPanagioti, a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester, says providers and health-care systems need to \u201ctrain and empower patients to be active partners\u201d in their own care. Under-trained and burned-out providers along with understaffed services are also key contributors to preventable patient harm, making training and funding for the workforce vital, she added in an email.\n\n\u201cPatient harm has multiple causes, and unless coordinated quality-improvement strategies are implemented, just intervening [at] one point of this chain is less successful,\u201d Panagioti told MarketWatch.\n\nPrevious research has sounded the alarm on this problem: One 2016 BMJ study, for instance, analyzed four studies of medical death rates from 2000 to 2008 and used hospital-admission rates from 2013. The researchers estimated that an annual 251,454 U.S. deaths \u2014 or 9.5% of all annual U.S. deaths \u2014 resulted from medical error, making it the third leading cause of death in the country.\n\nWhile much of the remedy may lie at the health-care provider and systemic level, there are still measures any patient can take to minimize their risk. \u201cPatients should be equal partners with health professionals for improving the safety and quality of their medical care,\u201d Panagioti said.\n\nHere\u2019s what she and other experts recommended:\n\nMake sure you fully understand any procedure or medication your doctor is recommending \u2014 and why. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for physicians to speak in medical language that is not readily understandable by most people,\u201d American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) president John Cullen, who practices family medicine in Valdez, Alaska, told MarketWatch. \u201cGetting common-sense explanations about what is actually happening and what the plan is, and really holding their physicians to that, is important.\u201d\n\nBrief the doctor on your allergies and health conditions, as well as on any medications you take. \u201cIf you have someone with you, make sure they know this information, and if not, have it written down and in sight so that any staff attending to you is aware and the information doesn\u2019t get lost during a rotation,\u201d Caitlin Donovan, a spokeswoman for the National Patient Advocate Foundation, said in an email. That list should include any vitamins or supplements you\u2019re taking, added Erica Mobley, the director of operations at the Leapfrog Group, a health-care watchdog.\n\nDon\u2019t assume every provider has access to all of your health-care information. Instead, be prepared to communicate it to each individual doctor. \u201cBetween specialists and their primary-care physician [and] even going in for surgery, the assumption is that all that information is there, and it may not be,\u201d Cullen said. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to check on the medical history in your file if possible, he added, as it can sometimes contain incorrect information.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this era of cloud information, and it just is not that way yet in medicine,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cThe whole information thing will improve. But we\u2019re sort of in this awkward phase at the moment.\u201d\n\nBring a friend or family member, especially if you have \u201cpoor health literacy or communication difficulties,\u201d Panagioti said. \u201cMost people, when they\u2019re hospitalized, are not operating at full capacity \u2014 so having a family member or friend with them in the hospital to keep a careful eye on things and speak up if they do sense that something may be wrong \u2026 can really be tremendously effective in preventing any potential error,\u201d Mobley said.\n\nIf it\u2019s not possible to bring an in-person advocate, Mobley added, try enlisting one remotely through tools like FaceTime AAPL, +0.48% . \u201c[It\u2019s] not exactly the same, but certainly can help,\u201d she said.\n\nKeep close track of your medications and results. Patients should \u201cdouble check with their health professional/pharmacist that this type/dose of medication is, indeed, the correct one for their condition, especially if this is the first time that they receive this medication or if there is a substantial change in the dose,\u201d Panagioti said. They should also keep track of prior clinical results \u201cand be able to identify any massive differences between time-points,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019ve been every day getting two pink pills and then next time the pills are yellow, [they should] speak up and say, \u2018What\u2019s going on? This is different from what I\u2019ve been getting,\u2019\u201d added Mobley. The discrepancy could just mean your prescription changed from brand-name to generic, but it could also mean you received the wrong drug.\n\nMake sure your doctor washes their hands. Handwashing is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of spreading infection, but research shows not all health-care providers practice proper hand hygiene. While it might seem intimidating or uncomfortable to call your doctor out, Mobley said, it\u2019s important that you speak up. She suggested saying something like, \u201cCould you please wash your hands?\u201d or \u201cI might have missed it, but can you please make sure you wash your hands before you come examine me?\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still hesitant, take it from a doctor: \u201cHand-washing is vitally important, and it\u2019s OK for patients to ask if providers wash their hands,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cThat\u2019s totally appropriate.\u201d\n\nResearch wisely. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said for looking at what procedures do \u2014 ideally, what the risks and benefits are,\u201d Cullen said. But it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t over-Google GOOG, -0.60% GOOGL, -0.67% and arrive at the doctor\u2019s office with a predetermined idea of your condition, he said, and that you make sure you\u2019re getting information from reputable sources like the Mayo Clinic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Medscape or the AAFP-operated FamilyDoctor.org. You can also check sites that provide hospital ratings, added Mobley.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to speak up. \u201cThey have to be their own advocate,\u201d Mobley said. \u201cThe likelihood of an error really does decrease significantly if they are willing and able to speak up if they have any questions or sense that something might be wrong.\u201d This advice may be particularly relevant for women, as research shows they are more likely to be under-treated for pain, less likely to have their symptoms taken seriously and more likely to be misdiagnosed.\n\n\u201cWomen should make sure they mention their top concern first when they meet with their provider \u2014 too many wait until the end of the appointment as the doctor is finishing up,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cBring an advocate with you who can further substantiate and vouch for your experience. It\u2019s not fair that a patient\u2019s word isn\u2019t enough, but often having another person there can reinforce your words.\u201d The person could be anyone you know and trust, she said, as long as they can be firm while remaining diplomatic.\n\nAsk your provider what they\u2019re doing to prevent errors. Mobley suggested asking whether they have technology in place to safeguard against medical errors, and if not, whether there are any other preventative measures in place. Inadequate responses to such a question might include \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019re taking care of that; you don\u2019t need to worry about it,\u201d Mobley said. If the physician is dismissive or demeaning of your concern, she added, that\u2019s a red flag.", "description": "Around 12% of preventable harm to patients is severe or leads to death, a new study finds.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN805_errors_ZG_20190719174344.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-22"}
