(AP) - Washington was pushed around in its last game, a bruising 23-13 loss to big, powerful Stanford.\n\nThe Huskies face a different kind of challenge Saturday night in the desert. Arizona is not oversized nor bruising. The Wildcats like to spread it out, beat teams with quick-hitting plays and their cache of explosive play-producing skill players.\n\n\u201cThat spread offense where they spread you out, there\u2019s creases and they\u2019re really good runners,\u201d Washington coach Chris Petersen said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got three or four guys, and JJ Taylor is exceptional. He\u2019s a different-type back that you don\u2019t see a lot in terms of one cut and away he goes.\u201d\n\nTo bounce back from their second loss of the season, the Huskies (4-2, 1-2 Pac-12) will not only need to keep track of Taylor, but Gary Brightwell, quarterback Khalil Tate and Darrius Smith.\n\nPetersen singled out Taylor, but he\u2019s been dealing with an ankle injury and the other three average more yards per carry, topped by Smith\u2019s 7.4.\n\nTate also has thrown for 1,088 yards and nine touchdowns while completing 67.5% percent of his passes.\n\nArizona\u2019s offensive balance has allowed the Wildcats (4-1, 2-0) to move atop the Pac-12 South after a 35-30 win over Colorado last week.\n\nThe win in Boulder was Arizona\u2019s fourth straight since an opening loss to Hawaii and third in a row as an underdog. The Wildcats will play the underdog role again this week despite being at home.\n\nThe reason: Washington\u2019s defense.\n\nThe Huskies may have given up explosive plays in each of the past two weeks, a rarity for them, but they\u2019re still among the Pac-12\u2019s best on D.\n\n\u201cTheir defense has been one of the best in this league for the last few years and they\u2019re also one of the top teams in the country every year in turnover margin,\u201d Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give it away. Their defense is fast, big guys inside. They can run really well, but also pride themselves in taking the ball away from you. We have a big challenge this week.\u201d\n\nA few more things to look for when Arizona hosts Washington on Saturday night:\n\nBETTER EASON\n\nWashington QB Jacob Eason has not been at his best in conference games. Through his first three Pac-12 matchups, Eason is completing 54.3% of his passes and averaging 149.3 yards passing. The numbers might not be so dramatic if Eason hadn\u2019t played so well in Washington\u2019s nonconference games, particularly the Huskies\u2019 win at BYU where he threw for 290 yards and three touchdowns in his first road start.\n\nLast week in the loss to Stanford, Eason was 16 of 36 for 231 yards, but after starting the game hot he struggled over the final three quarters.\n\nFOURTH QUARTER CATS\n\nOne reason for Arizona\u2019s winning streak has been its ability to close out games, something that had been missing in the past.\n\nThe Wildcats have outscored opponents 29-3 in the fourth quarter the past two games, including holding Colorado to three points in the final quarter despite playing at altitude.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, you\u2019ve got to be in shape,\u201d Sumlin said. \u201cWe were playing at 5,000 feet and it didn\u2019t bother us. A lot of things happened in this game and these guys are confident in that fourth quarter because they know they\u2019re in really good physical condition and they trust each other.\u201d\n\nWHERE\u2019S SALVON?\n\nWashington RB Salvon Ahmed had a career day against USC two weeks ago, then through a combination of circumstance and rotation of running backs, barely saw the ball against Stanford. Ahmed had just six carries for 28 yards versus Stanford a week after rushing for a career-best 157 yards against the Trojans. Part of the reason for Ahmed\u2019s absence was the strong running of Richard Newton, who averaged 6.4 yards per carry before leaving the game with a foot injury. The severity of Newton\u2019s injury is unclear but he\u2019s unlikely to play against Arizona, meaning Ahmed and Sean McGrew will likely carry the running load for the Huskies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it goes. Like I said before, I like how we rotate our backs. I don\u2019t think we have one guy that needs to be in there the whole time,\u201d Petersen said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Booth in Seattle contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington was pushed around in its last game, a bruising 23-13 loss to big, powerful Stanford.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/washington_stanford_football_24787_c0-139-3326-2079_s1200x700.jpg?e157520bff41d5c92d2a60ddacb465c6d03c4980", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
