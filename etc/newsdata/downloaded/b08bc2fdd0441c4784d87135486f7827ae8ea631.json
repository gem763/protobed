She\u2019s probably the only celebrity who both has the receipts and the spine to cuss the doubters out. But her new visual autobiography (simply named Rihanna) somehow doubles down on the cool by showing the less glamorous parts, not just the glossy ones. Eating a mango? Stunning. Gone swimming? Graceful. Getting ready in a car? Masterful. It\u2019d be rude if it wasn\u2019t so iconic. With the massive coffee-table book out today, available online at therihannabook.com, here are some of our favorite everyday Rihanna moments from Rihanna.\n\nRihanna onstage in white \u2014 Estadio Nacional, Santiago, Chile, 2015 (pages 6-7).

Photo: Dennis Leupold/Courtesy of Phaidon\n\nShe could drop just this photo, say, \u201cThis is the album,\u201d and never work again and we would support that.\n\nRio de Janeiro, 2014 (pages 220-221). Photo: Dennis Leupold/Courtesy of Phaidon\n\nRihanna\u2019s staple vacation look. See: her recent Instagram catwalk wearing a similar all-black bikini. If it ain\u2019t broke \u2026\n\nEn route to Christian Dior show, Paris, 2014 (pages 12-13).
