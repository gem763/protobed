More than a week after Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) announced it would eliminate commissions on online trades, Fidelity Investments adopted the same strategy for its 21.8 million accounts.\n\nFidelity will no longer charge its retail investors fees for e-trades of U.S. stocks, options or ETFs, and it will cut commissions for investment advisers Nov. 4.
