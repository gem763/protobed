Show Hide The new Brexit deal is essentially the old Brexit deal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a link to the full text. The backstop is replaced The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly. Consent Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years. The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge. That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020. Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not. Checks on border, ports and airports Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d. Future trade deals The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched. Customs Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods. No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use. Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above. A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed. West/east trade The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated. VAT EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland. Single electricity market The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change. Level playing field This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement. Lisa O'Carroll Brexit correspondent\n\n\u201cAnd that is why, I will later today be chairing a cabinet committee meeting \u2013 extraordinarily, on a Sunday \u2013 in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no deal is accelerated.\n\n\u201cIt means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer. It means that we are preparing to ensure that if no extension is granted \u2013 and we cannot guarantee that an extension will be granted \u2013 that we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.\u201d\n\nThere is no particular indication that the EU would refuse an extension if needed, and Gove\u2019s comments seem primarily aimed at increasing pressure on MPs to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal after the Commons voted on Saturday to withhold immediate support until it can scrutinise the surrounding legislation.\n\nThis prompted a backbench-instigated law obliging the prime minister to send a letter to the EU seeking a delay beyond 31 October, which Johnson did \u2013 albeit accompanied by another letter arguing against this.\n\nGove insisted the UK would still definitely leave on 31 October, saying he had even made a bet with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, that it would happen.\n\n\u201cWe are going to leave by 31 October,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the means and the ability to do so and people who \u2013 yesterday we had some people who voted for delay, voted explicitly to try to frustrate this process and to drag it out. I think actually the mood in the country is clear and the prime minister\u2019s determination is absolute and I am with him in this: we must leave by 31 October.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:41 Michael Gove insists UK will leave EU by end of October \u2013 video\n\nAt the same time as threatening no deal, Gove lavished praise on former Conservative MPs such as Amber Rudd, the ex-work and pensions secretary, who quit the government and party last month in protest at Johnson\u2019s seeming intent on no deal.\n\nRudd told the Ridge show earlier that she had backed the amendment on Saturday not to seek delay but as \u201can insurance policy\u201d, to try to prevent hardline Brexit MPs forcing no deal at a later point in the process.\n\nEU will wait until MPs debate Brexit deal before extension decision Read more\n\n\u201cI support the prime minister\u2019s deal, and I have told him I will support it next week,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cI understand people\u2019s fatigue \u2013 let me tell you, I suffer from it myself \u2013 but we have to make sure we don\u2019t leave with no deal.\u201d\n\nRudd said she expected most of the larger group of ex-Tory MPs who lost the party whip for rebelling over Brexit would also back the deal \u2013 even though, she said, it was a less good plan than that of Theresa May, and could well damage the economy.\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan was \u201cless good\u201d for the union in terms of both Scotland and Northern Ireland, Rudd said, saying she understood the reasons why the DUP did not back the plan.\n\nAsked about its economic impact, Rudd said: \u201cOur government\u2019s own assessments are that it will hurt the economy, I think, by 4% to 6% a year. So it\u2019s serious stuff. But I still think that it\u2019s the right thing to do, because we had the referendum in 2016, and there\u2019s other steps we can take to try and mitigate that.\u201d", "description": "Operation Yellowhammer begins as government pressures MPs to back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/466927d9d8b751b07079fe36037b9e75101420aa/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c820d1d929b4b74931fe32bc636092b6", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
