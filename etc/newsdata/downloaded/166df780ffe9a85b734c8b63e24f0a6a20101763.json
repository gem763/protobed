Austin Nola then hit a chopper to second baseman Kevin Kramer - rather than flip the ball to second, he ran at Narvaez, who alertly stopped and began to retreat.\n\nKramer then threw to first, and Narvaez was eventually tagged in a 4-3-6-2 rundown as Long scored.\n\nLong also drove in two runs and is hitting .288 with four home runs in 33 games. He is primarily a second baseman but started in left field in the series finale.\n\n\u201cEvery game for me is important,\u201d Long said. \u201cThese last few games I\u2019m definitely trying to put in the back on their heads to keep me in mind for next season where I can be in consideration for a job in spring training. I\u2019m putting in the work and trying to do the best I can when I get the chance to play.\u201d\n\nPirates manager Clint Hurdle did not fault Kramer for attempting a double play.\n\n\u201cI think the play is to immediately go to second base to start to initiate a double play or try to tag the runner and get the ball to first,\u201d Hurdle said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he had a play at the plate. Ball\u2019s hit too soft.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s Jake Elmore had three hits and two RBIs.\n\nBrandon Brennan (3-6) pitched one scoreless inning and rookie Erik Swanson worked around a walk in the 11th for his first career save. Clay Holmes (1-2) took the loss, though the winning run was unearned.\n\nMariners left-hander Yusei Kikuchi lasted four innings in his next-to-last start of the season, allowing four runs and eight hits with one strikeout and one walk.\n\n\u201cHis stuff wasn\u2019t as sharp or as good as we\u2019ve seen it in the past,\u201d Servais said.\n\nSigned from Japan to a three-year, $43-million contract in the offseason, Kikuchi has made 31 starts and pitched 155 2/3 innings. He is 6-10 with 5.55 ERA after never starting more than 26 games in any of his eight seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball.\n\n\u201cIt has definitely been an adjustment pitching every five days here,\u201d Kikuchi, who normally started once a week in Japan, said through a translator. \u201cIt\u2019s been a learning experience and I want to finish strong in my last start.\u201d\n\nPirates starter Joe Musgrove gave up four runs - two earned - and five hits in five innings. He struck out six and walked two.\n\nSeattle tied the score at 5-all in the seventh on Nola\u2019s two-out single after Elmore put Pittsburgh ahead 5-4 in the fifth with an RBI single.\n\nBoth teams had four-run second innings.\n\nLong\u2019s two-run single capped the Mariners\u2018 half in which Braden Bishop hit an RBI single and another run scored on shortstop Cole Tucker\u2019s throwing error. The Pirates got-run scoring doubles from Elias Diaz, Elmore and Musgrove before Kevin Newman capped the inning with an RBI single.\n\nElmore\u2019s hit snapped a 0-for-19 skid. The veteran utility player had gone home to Phoenix after Triple-A Indianapolis\u2019 season ended two weeks ago but was called up Tuesday because injuries had depleted the Pirates\u2018 depth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say, probably, the toughest thing, aside from physical, is turning it back on mentally because once you shut it down for the offseason, you\u2019re probably having a couple too many beers just for a couple weeks and not working out,\u201d Elmore said.\n\nPARTIAL DAY OFF\n\nThree of the Mariners\u2018 starting infielders - 2B Dee Gordon, 3B Kyle Seager and SS J.P. Crawford - were not in the starting lineup for a day game following a night game. Gordon and Seager were used as pinch-hitters, then remained in the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners: Open a three-game series at Baltimore on Friday night with RHP Felix Hernandez (1-6, 6.31 ERA) scheduled to face RHP Chandler Shepherd (0-0, 4.91). Hernandez\u2019s lone win came in his first start of the season April 1 against the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nPirates: LHP Steven Brault (4-5, 4.98) will start against Brewers RHP Chase Anderson (6-4, 4.50) on Friday night in the first game of a three-game series at Milwaukee. Brault is 1-4 with a 6.17 ERA in his past eight starts, including giving up 10 runs in 2 2/3 innings to the Chicago Cubs in his last outing Sept 13.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Seattle Mariners are on their way to finishing at the bottom of the AL West, but they plan to do more than merely play out the string over the final two weeks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Perrotto"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/mariners_pirates_baseball_11154_c0-159-3780-2362_s1770x1032.jpg?bc236445e90f1727f64806be5667ec2179e40c1c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
