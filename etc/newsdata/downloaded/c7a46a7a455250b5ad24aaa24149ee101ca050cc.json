The law, the first of its kind in the nation, was brought about specifically to target President Donald Trump.\n\nU.S. District Judge Morrison England Jr. issued the injunction, saying Trump and other candidates would face \u201cirreparable harm without temporary relief\u201d if a decision wasn't made. The judge will issue his final ruling in the next few days.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, candidates would have to provide five years worth of tax returns to the State of California by November in order to be on the March 2020 primary ballot.\n\nAttorneys for the State argued they have the administrative authority to determine ballot access rules, the Sacramento Bee reported.\n\nTrump's attorney Jay Sekulow applauded the judge's decision.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged that the federal court has tentatively concluded that a preliminary injunction should be granted. We look forward to the court\u2019s written order,\" Sekulow said in a statement. \"It remains our position that the law is unconstitutional because states are not permitted to add additional requirements for candidates for president, and that the law violated citizens\u2019 1st Amendment right of association.\"\n\nState officials, however, disagree with the decision.\n\n\u201cWe remain firm in our belief that SB 27 is constitutional and provides invaluable transparency for voters as they decide who will hold the most powerful office in the United States,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Padilla said in a statement. \u201cWe will determine our next course of action after the judge issues his written ruling.\u201d\n\nFrom The Hill:", "description": ".09/19/2019 19:46:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/260/04609b62-a977-4989-aa1a-9660ff208bd1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
