Chris Albury, specialist at Dominic Winter, said: 'There is a fantastic vitality to these watercolours, the sketches largely taken on the spot with some colouring added later. We have become so used to photography as the dominant medium of how we see so much of 20th century history and it is startling to see such vivid depictions of these terrible events drawn in real time as the events of the London Blitz unfolded. These drawings were made entirely unprompted as documentary work which Beddoes submitted to the War Artists' Advisory Committee'\n\nBeddoes' drawing of workers filling sandbags which were used to build shelters.
