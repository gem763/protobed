I mean, you don\u2019t smell like rosewater or Axe Body Spray, but you don\u2019t smell like B.O., either. You just smell like a person.\n\nBecause, evolutionarily, why would we be so disgusting that we need constant cleaning? And constant moisturizing and/or de-oiling? If we do more to allow our oil glands and bacteria to equilibrate, the theory goes, skin should stop fluctuating between oily and dry.\n\nIn our video series If Our Bodies Could Talk, we\u2019ve been exploring the microbiome in a three-episode series. The final segment is out today, embedded below. In it, I talk with microbiologist Martin Blaser about the consequences of cleaning our bodies as avidly as many people do. I also talk with a scientist at a biotech company called AOBiome that is selling live bacteria for people to spray on their skin in attempt to create a more Earthy ecosystem. Here\u2019s the episode:\n\nIn the course of meeting these people and thinking more about skin microbes, I started using less soap, and less shampoo, and less deodorant, and showering less. I went from every day to every other day to every three. And now I\u2019ve pretty much stopped altogether.\n\nI still wash my hands, all the time, which remains an extremely important way to prevent communicable diseases.\n\nI still rinse off elsewhere when I\u2019m visibly dirty, like after a run when I have to wash gnats off my face, because there is still the matter of society. If I have bed head, I lean into the shower and wet it down. But I don\u2019t use shampoo or body soap, and I almost never get into a shower.\n\nAt first I did smell bad, especially as I went without deodorant. I didn\u2019t quit cold turkey, but transitioned from a traditional aluminum-based stick to Soapwalla, which is just some plant oils and starches. Aluminum is the \u201cactive ingredient\u201d in many deodorants, specifically because it works as an antibiotic. As annoying as it is when things that are marketed as \u201cnatural\u201d\u2014because, what does that mean\u2014Soapwalla works well. But I\u2019ve lately stopped that, too.\n\nAnd everything is fine. I wake up and get out the door in minutes. At times when I might\u2019ve smelled bad before, like at the end of a long day or after working out, I just don\u2019t. At least, to my nose. I\u2019ve asked friends to smell me, and they insist that it\u2019s all good. (Though they could be allied in an attempt to ruin me.)\n\nObviously if you work in close quarters with people who are upset by the smell of bodies, trying this is inconsiderate. You may have to move to the wilderness first, or to a sailboat house (which you could buy with the money you save on skin and hair products). And as with anything I suggest, consult the people you love and your life coach before attempting.\n\nI don\u2019t know if everyone will achieve detergent-free steady state, which is extreme, but I do think there\u2019s room to question the endless marketing of cosmetic skin and hair cleansers and the need for daily showers.\n\nThe biggest dilemma might be what to do with all the extra time.\n\nTwo extra years of life.\n\nHow to fill the days?", "description": "We spend two full years of our lives washing ourselves.
