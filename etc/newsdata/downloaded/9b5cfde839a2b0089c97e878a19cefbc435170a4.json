Andrew Cuomo chastised the intent of the rule and said the court decision was an \"important win.\"\n\n\"The discriminatory rule was clearly crafted to target low-income immigrants of color and punish them for being poor by denying them entry to our country,\" he said.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said the decision \"is only further proof of something we already know \u2014 the President\u2019s policies are xenophobic and hateful, with no basis in fact or reality.\"\n\nThe city joined James' lawsuit in September, which argued that the public charge rule would cause irreparable harm to hundreds of thousands of immigrants as well as the economy. It was one of nearly a dozen legal challenges that popped up across the country around the attempted change.\n\nIn his ruling, Daniels inveighed against what he said were the \"repugnant\" aims of the administration.\n\n\"The rule is simply a new agency policy of exclusion in search of a justification. It is repugnant to the American Dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upward mobility,\" Daniels wrote. \"Immigrants have always come to this country seeking a better life for themselves and their posterity. With or without help, most succeed.\"\n\nCouncil Speaker Corey Johnson said the court ruling was \"fantastic news.\"\n\n\"Our nation was built by immigrants, and we will continue to stand with our immigrant New Yorkers and fight for their right to thrive and prosper in our City,\" Johnson said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "On a call with reporters after the decision, Tish James added the proposal was \"a drastic deviation of the original intent of Congress.\"", "authors": ["Amanda Eisenberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/da/d0/6222f299481bbc80c3ae04f9ffe7/ap-james-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
