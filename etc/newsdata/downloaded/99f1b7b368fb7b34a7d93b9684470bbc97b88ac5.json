Shortly afterward, Ukrainian authorities launched an investigation of their own.\n\nSome in the media, such as the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker, have repeated the claim that the Burisma investigation had been \u201cshelved\u201d by late 2015, when Joe Biden called for the prosecutor in charge to be fired.\n\nBut according to Burisma\u2019s own attorneys, the case was not formally closed until September 2016, months after the prosecutor was fired. Others, such as Transparency International, say the matter remained open until November 2016.", "description": "", "authors": ["Schweizer", "Foxnews.Com Opinion Peter-Schweizer-Busting-Biden-Myths-On-Ukraine-Conduct-Of-Joe-And-Hunter-Raises-Troubling-Questions"], "top_image": ""}
