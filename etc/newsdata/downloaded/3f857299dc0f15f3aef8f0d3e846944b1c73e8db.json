People were immediately off to the races claiming the photo was staged.\n\nThe raid, as reported, took place at 3:30PM Washington time. The photo, as shown in the camera IPTC data, was taken at \"17:05:24\". https://t.co/XV0MFfFiTt \u2014 Pete Souza (@PeteSouza) October 27, 2019\n\nWhile Souza did eventually correct himself and admit that the picture was taken after Trump was back in the White House, he didn\u2019t delete the original tweet.\n\nThe latest reporting from the NYT: the helicopters left Iraq at 5PM (Washington time), and they reported it was about a 70-minute flight to Syria. So actual raid had to happen some time after 6:10PM. https://t.co/rErbPLJlpD \u2014 Pete Souza (@PeteSouza) October 27, 2019\n\nBut as always, the correction never gets the attention of the original viral tweet and the conspiracy is still being promulgated.\n\nFolks on the left tried to compare the picture Pete Souza took when they got Osama bin Laden. Souza noted that every picture he made was saved according to the Federal Records Act and would eventually be made public.\n\nBut as Twitchy reported, journalist Sharyl Attkisson made a couple of important observations about Souza\u2019s comments.\n\nThis is interesting (\"all photos saved under the law\"). When I asked for White House & situation room photos the nite of Benghazi, White House photo office said I could likely have them by day's end. But Josh Earnest blocked release \u2014 and they've never been seen to this day. pic.twitter.com/pYAoLuXnyJ \u2014 Sharyl Attkisson\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@SharylAttkisson) October 28, 2019\n\nSo why was her request for the Benghazi pictures blocked by Obama White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest?\n\nAs we can see, the Trump administration had no problem publishing the pictures of the situation room during the Baghdadi raid. And that\u2019s on Saturday. The Obama administration had no problem posting the pictures of the situation room from taking down bin Laden and that\u2019s from 2015.\n\nPerhaps Souza or someone else in the Obama administration could shed some light on why those Benghazi pictures are still not released since September 2012, some seven years later?", "description": "Sharyl Attkisson Notices Something Obama Photographer Reveals, in Relation to Benghazi", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Stu Cvrk", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Kira Davis", "Brad Slager", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/benghazi-consulate-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
