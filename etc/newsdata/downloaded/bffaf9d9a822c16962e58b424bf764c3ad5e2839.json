But it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.'\n\nTom asks her: 'And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really OK, as in it's really been a struggle?' Meghan, visibly upset, then replies: 'Yes.'\n\nThe interview comes following months of controversy involving Meghan and Harry.\n\nThey came under fire for their privacy demands over Archie's christening, their use of private jets, and Meghan's Wimbledon appearance when she banned fans from taking photos.\n\nJust two weeks ago the couple waged war on the media, announcing they were suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of Meghan's father's letters.\n\nThe letter was revealed by Thomas Markle in an interview in which he said how hurt he was by comments made by the Duchess's friends in an article for People magazine.\n\nThe 75-year-old said he did not intend to share a private letter sent by Meghan, but felt pressured to do so after he was 'mischaracterised' in the People article.\n\nA spokesman for the Mail on Sunday said: 'The Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.'\n\nThe couple are also taking legal action against the Sun and now defunct News of the World over phone hacking allegations.\n\nFor the documentary presenter Tom Bradby followed the couple, and five-month-old Archie throughout their African tour which saw Prince Harry undertake solo engagements.\n\nMeghan Markle's interview with Tom Bradby for ITV documentary Tom Bradby: 'He's obviously very concerned about protecting you, and protecting you from what he felt his mother went through. 'Its obviously an area one has to tiptoes into very gently. But I don't know what the impact is on your physical or mental health of all the pressure that you clearly feel under Meghan: 'Look, any woman especially when they are pregnant you're really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a new born \u2013 you know\u2026' Tom: 'It's a long time ago but I remember yeah!' Meghan: 'And especially as a woman, it's a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it's, well\u2026 'And, also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I'm OK. But it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.' Tom: 'And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really OK, as in it's really been a struggle?' Meghan: 'Yes.'\n\nThe hour-long documentary features interviews with the royal couple as well and how they\u2019re balancing public and private life.\n\nAlso in the documentary Prince Harry has given a searingly open interview about the 'festering wound' his mother's death left in his life.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 35, told Bradby that every click and flash of a camera in the public eye gives him 'the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best'.\n\nHe says he felt significant pressure being a member of the royal family in the spotlight, and was particularly stressed by the memories of his mother's relationship with the press.\n\nHe was asked: 'Do you feel at peace in a way yet or is it still a sort of wound that festers?'\n\nTo which he replied: 'I think probably a wound that festers.\n\n'I think being part of this family, in this role, in this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash it takes me straight back, so in that respect it's the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.'\n\nMeghan and Harry made the comments during his and his wife's recent 10-day tour of Africa during which the prince emotionally retraced his mother's footsteps 22 years after her death.\n\nDuring the interviews, due to be broadcast on Sunday at 9pm on ITV, Prince Harry says that media focus around being a member of the Royal family means he 'gets reminded of the bad stuff'.\n\nHe added: 'Being here now, 22 years later, trying to finish what she started will be incredibly emotional. But everything I do reminds of her.\n\nIn a heartbreaking interview, the Duke of Sussex, 35, (pictured) told ITV News at Ten anchor, Tom Bradby, (also pictured) that every click and flash of a camera in the public eye gives him 'the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best'\n\nHarry made the comments during his and his wife's recent 10-day tour of Africa during which he emotionally retraced his mother's footsteps 22 years after her death (Diana is pictured with Harry on holiday in Majorca, Spain on August 10, 1987)\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their son Archie meet with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Mrs Tutu at their legacy foundation in Cape Town, on day three of their tour of Africa last month\n\n'But as I said, with the role, with the job and the sort of the pressure that come with that I get reminded of the bad stuff, unfortunately.'\n\nDuring the tour Prince Harry paid an 'emotional' visit to a street in Angola that was once a minefield visited by his mother Diana shortly before her death.\n\nPrincess Diana walked across a cleared minefield near the central city of Huambo in 1997 to highlight the plight of a country that remains plagued by land mines 17 years after the end of its civil war.\n\nThe images of her in body armour and a mask gave the anti-landmine campaign global recognition.\n\nJust months later Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris, when Harry was 12.\n\n'It has been emotional retracing my mother's steps along this street 22 years on,' said Harry, standing on Huambo's now-paved Princess Diana Street during the tour.\n\n'Being here on this transformed and bustling street... shows the tremendous impact that clearing landmines has on communities and their futures.'\n\nLast month the Duke of Sussex walks through a minefield in Dirico, Angola, during a visit to see the work of landmine clearance charity the Halo Trust\n\nHarry's mother Diana visited a minefield in Angola in January, 1997.
