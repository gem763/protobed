The vote is set to become a proxy referendum on European Union membership.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nJohnson won a vote in the House of Commons for a bill to set the date of the next election as Dec. 12 by 438 to 20.\n\nMPs voted 315 to 295 to reject a Labour bid for the election to be held on Dec. 9\n\nElection Bill now passes to the House of Lords\n\nTen Tories who were kicked out of the party for opposing Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy have been re-admitted\n\nMPs Approve Dec. 12 General Election (8:25 p.m.)\n\nMPs agreed to hold a general election on Dec. 12, voting in favor of Boris Johnson\u2019s bill by a margin of 438 to 20.\n\nThe prime minister earlier saw off an attempt by opposition parties to change the date to Dec. 9 (see 8 p.m.).\n\nThe bill now heads to the House of Lords, where it can still be amended. The unelected upper chamber typically yields to the view of the lower one \u2013 meaning that an early general election is now a near certainty.\n\nMPs Reject Election Date of Dec. 9 (8 p.m.)\n\nMPs rejected a bid by the opposition Labour Party to change the proposed election date to Dec. 9 from Dec. 12. The amendment to change the date was defeated by 315 votes to 295.\n\nOpposition politicians had argued an earlier date would make it more likely that students would be able to vote, as many universities break up for the holiday in the week of Dec. 9.\n\nBut the government won the day with its argument that the earlier date would make it hard to pass vital legislation relating to Northern Ireland before Parliament dissolves (See 6 p.m.)\n\nJohnson Flexible on Date, Official Says (6:40 p.m.)\n\nThe wrangling over the date of the election is continuing, but Boris Johnson is not tied to his preferred date of Dec. 12 at all costs.\n\nMPs in the House of Commons are now discussing Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal to move the election date to Dec. 9.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to wrap up Parliamentary business in time for a Dec. 9 election, the premier would probably not abandon his plan if that date were forced on him by Parliament, a Tory official said.\n\nThis all points to an election being agreed to by Tuesday night.\n\nTen Expelled Tories Back in the Fold (6:30 p.m.)\n\nJohnson met in private with 10 of the 21 MPs Conservative MPs who were thrown of the party for opposing his Brexit strategy and they have been re-admitted, a party spokesman said.\n\nThey include two former Cabinet ministers: Greg Clark and Caroline Nokes. Some of the other notable names are Alistair Burt, Nicholas Soames -- the grandson of Winston Churchill, Stephen Hammond and Margot James. The door has been left open for others to be brought back as well, the spokesman said.\n\nThe development is good news for Johnson as it points to some of the former rebels planning to vote with the government and may help to heal rifts in the party.\n\nWhat does the EU make of all this? (6:15 p.m.)\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said a prospective snap election in the U.K. won\u2019t have a material effect on the concrete negotiations involving Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe problems to be solved remain the same -- and the solutions would also be the same,\u201d Barnier told Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe spent two years negotiating a 600-page treaty with Theresa May. With Boris Johnson we negotiated for a comparatively short amount of time,\u201d he said. May was \u201ccourageous and tenacious,\u201d and Johnson is \u201calso tenacious and a strong character,\u201d he said.\n\nGovt. Rejects Changing Election Day (6 p.m.)\n\nCabinet Office Minister Oliver Dowden said if MPs opt for a Dec. 9 election, as proposed in an amendment, there\u2019s a \u201creal danger\u201d nurses, teachers and police officers in Northern Ireland won\u2019t get paid after the end of the month as there won\u2019t be time to approve a budget for the province.\n\nA Dec. 12 election \u201cgives Parliament enough time to progress essential business, and specifically the Northern Ireland budget Bill,\u201d Dowden said.\n\nAsked twice whether it would be possible for the House of Commons to sit on Friday in order to ensure the Northern Ireland legislation goes through, he replied that the bill needed to be \u201cproperly\u201d considered.\n\nEarly Election Bill Proceeds to Next Stage (5:45 p.m.)\n\nThe House of Commons just gave approval in principle to the government\u2019s bill calling for an early general election. There was no need for a vote, and the bill passed its so-called second reading on the nod. It now goes to the committee stage, when it can be amended.\n\nParliament Won\u2019t Vote on Expanding Electorate (5:20 p.m.)\n\nDeputy House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rejected proposals to lower the voting age to 16 and to give EU nationals living in the U.K. a vote in the upcoming general election. The government said it would pull its election bill rather than accept either measure.\n\nThe only amendment Hoyle selected was Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal to change the date of the election from Dec. 12 to Dec. 9. The Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party have indicated they would support such a move. The government said it wouldn\u2019t rule out a vote on Dec. 9, but said it would be a rush.\n\nFarewell and Good Luck from Tusk (4:30 p.m.)\n\nEU Council President Donald Tusk warned that the Brexit extension to Jan. 31 \u2018may be the last one,\u2019 after announcing the bloc has formally adopted its decision to allow a delay.\n\n\u201cPlease make the best use of this time,\u201d Tusk said in a tweet. \u201cI will keep my fingers crossed for you.\u201d\n\nEx-Tories Add Backing to Votes at 16 (3:40 p.m.)\n\nAt least four former Conservative MPs have signed a proposed amendment that would expand the electoral roll to include 16 and 17 year olds.\n\nAnna Soubry, who quit the party in February, and Guto Bebb, Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve, who were expelled in September for rebelling against Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans, have all put their name to an amendment by Labour backbencher Stephen Doughty calling for the change.\n\nBut the issue may not come to a vote. The list of amendments chosen for debate will be announced sometime after 5:45 p.m.\n\nJohnson to Pull Bill If Franchise Amendments Pass (3:20 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson would abandon his attempt to hold a general election next month if amendments are passed to allow EU nationals and 16-year-olds to vote, his spokesman told reporters in Westminster.\n\nExpanding the franchise would be a bad idea and would force a six-month delay until there can be a national vote, the spokesman said.\n\nBut he said the prime minister may press on if MPs vote to hold the election on Dec. 9 instead of Dec. 12. A vote on Dec. 9 would be a rush but the government isn\u2019t ruling it out, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which amendments the speaker will select, so these issues may not come to a vote.\n\nLib Dems and SNP Back Votes at 16 (3:10 p.m.)\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party will join Labour in backing any amendment to allow 16-year-olds and EU nationals with settled status in the U.K. to vote in the general election, according to a Lib Dem official.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat stance is a change from Monday, when party officials briefed they were likely to abstain on any such amendment. That\u2019s because, while they want 16-year olds to have the vote, they think there isn\u2019t time to change the electoral register in time for a December election.\n\nIan Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, reminded lawmakers that EU citizens are already on the electoral roll for local elections so it would be easy to give them votes in a general election.\n\nCorbyn Backs Expansion of Electorate (2:50 p.m.)\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he will back amendments to allow 16-year-olds and EU nationals with settled status in the U.K. to vote in the general election.\n\nIf the measures pass, it could torpedo the legislation, and therefore the early national poll.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s spokesman, James Slack, earlier told reporters that the Electoral Commission recommends changes to the electoral register shouldn\u2019t be made less than 6 months before a vote, and that the government has no plans to expand the franchise.\n\nJohnson Makes Case For Early Vote (2:35 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson made his case for an early election in the House of Commons, saying the current crop of members wouldn\u2019t vote through his Withdrawal Agreement Bill and accusing opposition MPs of not wanting to deliver Brexit.\n\n\u201cThere is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism,\u201d he told the chamber. \u201cThat is, Mr speaker, to refresh this Parliament and to give people a choice.\u201d\n\nMPs Vote to Allow Amendments to Election Bill (2:20 p.m.)\n\nMPs backed the amendment by Labour backbencher Stella Creasy (see 2:10 p.m.) enabling them to add changes to Boris Johnson\u2019s bill to force through a general election.\n\nThe government had sought to by bypass normal Parliamentary rules and limit the opportunity for rank-and-file lawmakers to change the proposed law.\n\nIt now opens up the bill to possible amendments, including from those who want to change the date of the election, or to add 16 and 17-year-olds and EU nationals to the electorate.\n\nMPs Voting to Allow Election Bill Amendments (2:10 p.m.)\n\nMPs are voting on an amendment to the government\u2019s schedule for proceeding with the general election bill in the House of Commons.\n\nIn essence, the amendment, proposed by Labour backbencher Stella Creasy, would allow MPs to amend the legislation calling for an early general election. The government is trying to bypass normal Parliamentary rules to speed its passage through parliament.\n\nCreasy said her amendment aims merely to put the concept of \u201cfair play\u201d back in the Commons. \u201cWhat the government was trying to do, in simple terms, was rig today\u2019s debate,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cLetting this program motion go through without the full list of rules, is like letting Lance Armstrong keep all his medals.\u201d\n\nElection Bill Presented to Parliament (1:45 p.m.)\n\nThe bill calling for an early general election has been presented in Parliament \u2013 what\u2019s called its first reading. That\u2019s just a formality. MPs have 6 hours to get it through all of its stages in the House of Commons.\n\nThat includes a vote on second reading \u2013 expected by about 6 p.m. and then debate on possible amendments at what\u2019s called the committee stage of the bill. If it stays to schedule, the final vote should be no later than 7:45 p.m.\n\nOBR Forecasts Still Due on Nov. 7 (12:45 p.m.)\n\nThe government\u2019s fiscal watchdog said it will still publish its economic forecasts on Nov. 7, even though Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid\u2019s Budget the day before has been canceled.\n\nThe forecasts, which were due to be presented in response to the Budget, will include updated assessments of the impact of the Brexit deal Boris Johnson agreed with the EU on Oct. 17. Javid has ruled out publishing any government impact assessments of the deal.\n\nIn a letter to the Treasury, Robert Chote, Chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said it is required by law to publish at least two forecasts per year and will go ahead with its plans.\n\nChote said in his letter that the new deal is unlikely to have made a \"significant quantitative difference\u201d compared to the last forecast in March, which was based on Theresa May\u2019s deal and assumed a transition period to Dec. 2020.\n\nJohnson Will Consider Other Election Dates (12:30 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson is open to considering other dates for a general election, but doesn\u2019t consider a poll on Dec. 9 as logistically possible, his spokesman James Slack told reporters in Westminster.\n\nThat means Dec. 10 or 11 could emerge as the date for a pre-Christmas election, rather than the Dec. 12 vote proposed by the prime minister.\n\nSlack also said that Johnson wouldn\u2019t countenance the lowering of the voting age to 16, or the inclusion of EU nationals in the vote, both of which have been proposed by opposition parties. Even if he supported the changes, there would be practical issues with either happening in time for an election next month, Slack said.\n\nMixed Reaction to Election From Labour MPs (11:50 a.m.)\n\nNot all Labour MPs seem happy about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to back a general election.\n\nDarren Jones, who represents a constituency in Bristol, tweeted a painting of the Charge of the Light Brigade \u2013 one of Britain\u2019s best-known military disasters. Another, Ben Bradshaw said an election shouldn\u2019t be a tool to resolve Brexit. \u201cA general election is about everything about governing the country,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nBut others threw their support behind the plan. Laura Pidcock tweeted \u201cBRING IT ON,\u201d while Clive Lewis tweeted an abbreviated version of the same message: \u201cbring it.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Time,\u2019 Corbyn Says (11:30 a.m.)\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted that his party will back a general election, confirming earlier statements from his office (see 10:50 a.m.). \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said.\n\nPound Erases Loss With Election Likely (11:10 a.m.)\n\nThe pound reversed an earlier decline as traders judged a vote in Parliament on an early election vote was likely to pass with the Labour Party\u2019s backing (see 10:50 a.m.). The currency gained as much as 0.1% to $1.2873 before paring gains.\n\nMarket participants judge a snap poll could bring back a Conservative majority and end the Brexit deadlock, according to Nomura International Plc analyst Jordan Rochester.\n\nCorbyn Backs December Election (10:50 a.m.)\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated his party will back a general election in December, meaning Johnson will be able to go to the polls by the end of the year.\n\nCorbyn told his team: \u201cFor the next three months, our condition of taking no deal off the table has now been met,\u201d according to a statement. \u201cWe will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe parties are haggling over the date of the election, with a day between Dec. 9 and Dec. 12 currently on the table. Amendments to Johnson\u2019s bill are being written now.\n\nTrust Is Key as SNP Deliberates Over Election (10:45 a.m.)\n\nScottish National Party MPs are scrutinizing the contents of the government\u2019s election bill ahead of a debate later today, according to a spokesman.\n\nThe party wants an election, but its lawmakers don\u2019t trust Boris Johnson to keep to his word, he said.\n\nGovernment Offers Dec. 11 to Win Lib Dem Support (10 a.m.)\n\nThe negotiations have begun in Westminster ahead of the vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a Dec. 12 general election. With the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party seeking a Dec. 9 poll, a U.K. official said the government has offered Dec. 11 as a compromise.\n\nA spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said the party is looking at the offer.\n\nThe government needs some opposition votes to reach a simple majority for its election bill to pass, but it also wants to avoid amendments being attached to the legislation.\n\nStudents\u2019 Vacation Key to Election Date Battle (9 a.m.)\n\nThe biggest sticking point in Boris Johnson\u2019s bid for a Dec. 12 general election is the date itself. Two smaller opposition parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, whose support could be key to the government\u2019s chances, want an earlier poll on Dec. 9 to ensure students are still at their universities to cast their ballots.\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Chuka Umunna told BBC radio on Tuesday his party would not accept Dec. 12. But Conservative minister Brandon Lewis said Dec. 12 is the \u201cright date\u201d and accused the opposition parties of seeking to stop Brexit altogether. The government has said it needs time before Parliament breaks up for an election to secure key Northern Ireland legislation.\n\nJohnson lacks a majority in Parliament, so will need at least some opposition votes to secure an early election. But the Liberal Democrats and SNP, both staunchly pro-EU and anti-Brexit, regard students as a key constituency.\n\nMeanwhile, even though the main opposition Labour Party abstained in Monday\u2019s vote on a snap poll, their position appeared to be softening on Tuesday. Labour\u2019s trade spokesman, Barry Gardiner, hinted his party could back a Dec. 9 election, telling BBC radio: \u201cThe first thing is to make sure that students are not disenfranchised by the date of the election.\u201d\n\nHammond: Election Will Usher in Tory Hardliners (8:30 a.m.)\n\nFormer Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who is still suspended from the party after defying Boris Johnson over Brexit, warned an election would usher in \u201chardliner\u201d pro-Leave MPs to the Tory benches.\n\n\u201cI fear that the real narrative here is that the Vote Leave activists, the cohort that has seized control in Downing Street -- and to some extent in the headquarters of the Conservative Party -- wants this general election to change the shape of the Conservative Party in Parliament,\u201d Hammond told BBC radio.\n\nHammond also disputed the government\u2019s narrative that he and other expelled Tories, and MPs in general, are the ones blocking Brexit. The House of Commons voted in favor of the initial passage of Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill before the government pulled the legislation over its failure to win backing for an accelerated timetable, Hammond said.\n\nRees-Mogg: No Plan to Bring Brexit Bill Back (Earlier)\n\nIn his business statement to Parliament late Tuesday, Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government wants to get the early election bill through all stages of the House of Commons on Tuesday.\n\nHe also said the government had no plan to bring back the Withdrawal Agreement Bill -- the legislation that puts the Brexit deal into U.K. law -- before Parliament breaks up for the election. That\u2019s a key demand of the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, who opened up the legislative route to an early election when they expressed willingness to vote for a snap poll, subject to Brexit not being concluded beforehand.\n\nAccording to Tuesday\u2019s House of Commons order paper, debate on the election bill is due to begin at 12:30 p.m. -- subject to ministerial statements and urgent questions -- and can continue \u201cuntil any hour.\u201d\n\nEarlier:\n\nBoris Johnson Won\u2019t Give Up on Trying to Force a U.K. ElectionBrexit Bulletin: Fourth Time Lucky?Two Foreign Exchange Traders, Three Votes and a Brexit Meltdown", "description": "Johnson Wins Commons Support For Dec. 12 Election: Brexit Update", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picd0c3d4828bf4b569a26c222114d90b5d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
