Kyle Sandilands, 48, has teased some of the bizarre cases that will be heard on Trial By Kyle this season\n\n'The daughter had broken the bed while she (the mother) was away on holidays and was refusing to fix it,' he explained.\n\nKyle was able to reveal that the daughter had in fact had a lover in the bed and that they caused the damage.\n\n'The mum just went to town on this kid\u2026 and it's just amazing what people will say to their most treasured loved ones on television,' he laughed.\n\nIn court: Speaking on The Kyle And Jackie O Show on Monday, the radio shock-jock described the bizarre case of a mother (left) who was suing her own daughter (right) over a bed she had broken during sex\n\nHe also spoke about a backpacker who claimed that another backpacker had stolen his belongings, including a bag of pistachios.\n\nKyle recalled: 'I was like, 'Are you joking?' But there was video footage and this guy was denying and denying and denying it.\n\n'And then we roll up the footage and he still denies it and it's obvious it's him.'\n\nThat's nuts! He also spoke about a backpacker who claimed that another backpacker had stolen his belongings, including a bag of pistachios\n\nIt comes after Kyle revealed to TV Tonight that he had refused to include fame-seekers on his program, especially those who had previously appeared on another reality show.\n\n'I would sometimes film a case for an hour, because we were rushing the pilot too much. And there were too many 'TV losers' on,' he explained.\n\n'Little tryhards from other shows. So I said: 'Let's forget about that rubbish. Let's do more real cases that are serious.'' he added.\n\nEvidence: Kyle said there was even video footage of the backpacker incident that apparently proved the defendant was the culprit (pictured)\n\n'If someone was on there just to get noticed I would stop filming it and say ''Let's f*** these people off.'' They're not here for the right reason.'\n\nIt may be that the radio shock jock is referring to the first season where former Big Brother star Sky Wheatley and former Married At First Sight's Nasser Sultan appeared on the show.\n\nJoining Kyle in the courtroom is Bachelor season one winner and criminal lawyer Anna Heinrich as his legal expert and model Toks James as security.\n\nTrail By Kyle will premiere on Channel 10 on Thursday at 8.30pm", "description": "Trial By Kyle is one of the year's most anticipated shows.", "authors": ["Alisha Buaya For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/02/19972814-0-image-a-7_1571620031899.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
