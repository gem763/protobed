Queensland's shark control program is again in the spotlight after a British backpacker lost a foot and another man was injured during a shark attack in the Whitsundays. The Opposition criticised the state government for recently dialing back its shark control program after it removed 27 shark drum lines from beaches stretching from the central to north Queensland coastline. Mr Mander told Sky News \u201cnot only have swimmers been put at risk but our tourism industry has been put at risk as well\u201d. \u201cThese headlines around the world that people are being attacked by sharks in one of our prime tourist areas is just terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Palaszczuk government has no plan B, they have taken these drum lines out and have no alternative.\u201d Image: News Corp Australia", "description": "Watch the Latest News.com.au Videos including Featured News Videos and Sports Videos and News Highlights.
