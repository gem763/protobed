That\u2019s the way this country works.\u2019 To tell a tech company that it can sell products, but not buy an operating system or chips, is like telling a hotel company that it can open its doors, but not put beds in its hotel rooms or food in its restaurant. Either way, you put the survival of that company at risk.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Smith is on the circuit right now to discuss his new book, Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age, in which US and China tensions feature heavily.\n\nREAD MORE: Former Homeland Security Chief: Change in UK prime minister should lead to change in policy on Huawei\n\nThe US, as well as a number of other countries and agencies, have continually pointed out Huawei\u2019s ties to the Chinese government as well as emphasising China\u2019s National Intelligence Law that says organisations must \u201csupport, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work.\u201d\n\nSince then, Australia, the US and New Zealand, have barred local firms from using Huawei to provide the technology for their 5G networks. The UK is yet to make a decision.\n\nLast month, former US secretary of state for Homeland Security Tom Ridge told Yahoo Finance UK about the threat of Huawei over 5G servers.\n\nRidge, who was the inaugural Homeland Security chief under George Bush described exploitation by Huawei in order to ensure information makes it to the Chinese intelligence services is \u201cvirtually guaranteed.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have a company obliged in their intelligence law in helping their government get information, [would mean] exploitation is virtually guaranteed. Hopefully the next prime minister [now Boris Johnson] will sit down with Five Eyes and they will persuade him risk above cost.\u201d\n\nRidge continued that allowing Huawei into the UK \u201cwould alter information sharing, it would be more cumbersome. This change in government will hopefully bring about a change in policy.\u201d", "description": "Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith hit out at the trading ban between US firms and Huawei.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Xe_bmZHKEM0I56_4Q4gbkw--~B/aD0yODM4O3c9NDI1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/e7e532c0-d213-11e9-87dd-a524fe1ae644", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
