In the coming episodes, they beg Breda to see a psychiatrist and, she agrees to do so simply to placate them. However, things don\u2019t exactly go according to plan.\n\nBreda has been disposing of those whom she deems to be bad dads for the best part of a year, but her plan has started to unravel as of late, as she never planned for Tony to get caught up in her mission. Trying to do what she believes is right, she\u2019s allowed Tony to live, but in doing so she\u2019s created a whole lot of problems for herself, as she\u2019s desperately tried to keep his presence up at the pig farm a secret.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt didn\u2019t take Goldie too long to notice her mum\u2019s odd behaviour, and both Sylver and Jack (Jimmy McKenna) copped on to the fact that something\u2019s not quite right too, and thus they set a plan in motion in the coming episodes, as Goldie books her an appointment with a psychiatrist \u2014 much to Breda\u2019s dismay.\n\nYes, Breda isn\u2019t pleased about what Goldie\u2019s done, and thus she rants to Tony about it. However, she later realises that going to the appointment could well prove to be the answer she needs, as it would get her children of her back.\n\nHowever, things don\u2019t go according to plan, and Breda gets frustrated during the appointment, as she feels like she\u2019s being interrogated. She gets incredibly defensive, but the psychiatrist misinterprets Breda\u2019s actions and words, and believes that she\u2019s demonstrating confusion.\n\nLater, the psychiatrist informs a worried Goldie, Sylver and Jack that she thinks Breda may have dementia.\n\nWill they work out what\u2019s really going on?\n\nHollyoaks continues Friday 18th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Every suspect revealed as Mercedes McQueen is shot and left to die\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Jake Quickenden\u2019s Woody charmed into dangerous action by Cindy Cunningham\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Breda's frustrations get the better of her during a meeting with the psychiatrist \u2014 which leads to a rather shocking turn of events.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GOLDIE-AND-BREDA-copy-d13c_1571341085.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
