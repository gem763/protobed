It has already recruited five employees in the southeastern city over the past year, LinkedIn data shows.\n\nIn April, CEO Tobi L\u00fctke said the company was looking to sign Chinese exporters up to the platform. \u201cThere (are) a lot of Chinese brands now out there which are trying to go global, and do so directly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have worked with them (and) they are seeing significant success using the Shopify platform.\u201d In June, the firm announced merchants would be able to use its platform in traditional and simplified Chinese.\n\nSome analysts believe there\u2019s also an opportunity for Shopify to focus on merchants selling to Chinese shoppers.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the China opportunity, there\u2019s a massive commerce market there, (a) huge number of eyeballs that they can they can potentially reach out to,\u201d said Guggenheim Partners director Ken Wong, who covers the company\u2019s stock.\n\nHe noted that some multinational brands that use the company\u2019s Shopify Plus service \u2014 which gives larger merchants access to dedicated engineering and support resources \u2014 are already selling to Chinese customers through the platform.\n\nThe firm\u2019s sales are heavily focused in North America; 77 per cent of its 2018 revenue came from merchants in the U.S. and Canada, and another 11 per cent from the U.K. and Australia. (The company does not break out the remaining 12 per cent of revenue by country.)\n\nShopify declined The Logic\u2019s request for comment, but the company said in April it had made international growth one of its investment priorities for 2019.\n\nIts core markets are \u201cnot tapped, but they\u2019re definitely a little more saturated,\u201d said Wong. The company added fewer new merchants in 2018 than the previous year, he noted. It ended 2018 with about 820,000 merchants on the platform, compared to approximately 609,000 in 2017 and more than 377,500 in 2016.\n\nR. \u201cRay\u201d Wang, founder of Silicon Valley-headquartered Constellation Research, also sees a domestic opportunity for Shopify. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of interest for cross-border commerce \u2026 coming from merchants who want to sell in China,\u201d he said.\n\nChina\u2019s shoppers continue to spend, despite the tariffs on U.S. goods born of the countries\u2019 ongoing trade dispute. The country\u2019s consumer market will become the world\u2019s largest in 2021, according to a July report from eMarketer, a research agency. It predicted e-commerce sales would reach US$1.9 trillion this year, more than half the global total.\n\nBut Shopify could also build a Chinese merchant base by signing up firms that want to export. Ross MacMillan, vice-president at T. Rowe Price, said some Chinese manufacturers whose products are listed on online marketplaces or sold by dropshippers \u2014 merchants who take orders but do not handle production or shipping \u2014 are interested in cutting out those middlemen and selling \u201cdirectly to the U.S. consumer.\u201d It\u2019s the direct-to-consumer model favoured by many of Shopify\u2019s biggest clients. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a fraction of the Chinese market that wants a branded presence, it\u2019s still a big opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the job posting, the new head of business development will be tasked with developing \u201cstrategic relationships for Shopify with leading players in e-commerce.\u201d They will join a head of enterprise business for the country, hired in April. The company is also hiring someone to sign up new partners \u2014 the firm\u2019s term for the developers who build third-party apps for its platform \u2014 as well as a person to oversee the \u201ctranslation and localization of Shopify\u2019s product content\u201d into simplified Chinese.\n\nMacMillan noted that Shopify\u2019s playbook for international expansion over the last two years has included investing in localization, like translating the platform into local languages, offering regionally specific payment methods and letting merchants list products in multiple currencies. The company also hires in the target country \u2014 particularly business development staff \u2014 and works with domestic companies that can build products for its app marketplace.\n\nThe company\u2019s moves to date in China appear to fit this pattern.\n\nChina\u2019s e-commerce market is already crowded with major domestic players. Baozun, an e-commerce platform that Wong called China\u2019s Shopify equivalent, had net revenues of over US$748 million in 2018, compared to the Canadian firm\u2019s US$1.07 billion that year. Chinese tech giant Alibaba\u2019s Tmall marketplace also allows brands to set up online storefronts to sell to consumers. \u201cYou already have large marketplaces that \u2026 keep Shopify from being able to penetrate in quickly, which is what they did here,\u201d said Wong.\n\nShopify could also face challenges integrating with local social media platforms, e-commerce websites and payment processors \u2014 a key part of its strategy in North America. For example, merchants can sell through their Facebook pages and buy ads on Snapchat through their Shopify accounts. They can also list products on eBay and Amazon.\n\nWong said it\u2019s not clear that Chinese tech companies will offer the same kinds of integrations. \u201cMy external perception is that it\u2019s a little more walled garden in China than it is here,\u201d he said, noting that WeChat, the country\u2019s biggest messaging app, already has its own store functionality.\n\nShopify has already been courting the big Chinese marketplaces, according to MacMillan. \u201cAlibaba, for example, has organized conferences and events here in the U.S., and you\u2019ll often find that Shopify is a sponsor,\u201d he noted, adding that he\u2019s \u201ca little surprised\u201d that it has yet to announce such a partnership.\n\nWang said Shopify could seek a relationship with JD.com, a Chinese online marketplace with a large network of warehouses, trucks and bikers to deliver orders across the country. \u201cAnybody who wants to get commerce into China basically uses JD the way we would use a FedEx or UPS,\u201d he said. Shopify is partnering with local logistics and technology companies to build a fulfillment service guided by artificial intelligence in the U.S.\n\nHowever, all three analysts cautioned that Shopify is still just starting out in China. \u201cThey have a very nascent position there,\u201d said MacMillan. \u201cThe product\u2019s not really available.\u201d\n\nThe Logic", "description": "Shopify is recruiting a head of business development to forge partnerships in China\u2019s competitive online shopping space", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/shopify.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
