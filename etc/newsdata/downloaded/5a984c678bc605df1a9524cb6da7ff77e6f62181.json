While some people might do this with a variety of different speakers, I\u2019ve been using the same speaker in all of those places: Sonos\u2019 new $399 Move.\n\nThe Move is a milestone product for Sonos, a 17-year-old independent company that sells popular wireless home audio products. It\u2019s the first model from the company with a battery and support for Bluetooth audio, which means it\u2019s the first Sonos speaker you can easily transport \u2014 or move, if you will \u2014 from place to place. It\u2019s more than a typical Bluetooth speaker, though, because the Move also supports the classic Sonos Wi-Fi system and integrates seamlessly with Sonos\u2019 other speakers. It\u2019s also a smart speaker with always-on microphones that you can use to speak to Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google Assistant.\n\nAs the first portable Sonos product, the Move has a lot riding on it. For the most part, it shoulders that burden well. It is an excellent speaker. But you might want to read on if you\u2019re thinking of dropping nearly $400 to replace that cheap Bluetooth speaker in your travel bag with a Move.\n\nOur review of Sonos Move Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Loud, full sound\n\nReliable wireless connectivity\n\nSeamlessly integrates with other Sonos products\n\nAmazon Alexa and Google Assistant on board\n\nSounds great indoors or out Bad Stuff Pricey\n\nSome significant setup bugs and headaches\n\nToo big and heavy to travel with\n\n10-hour battery life is shorter than other Bluetooth speakers Buy for $399.00 from Amazon Buy for $399.99 from Best Buy\n\nThe first thing to notice about the Move as you take it out of the box is just how big and heavy it is. This isn\u2019t your typical portable Bluetooth speaker. The Move is a substantial thing that weighs over 6.6 pounds and towers almost 10 inches tall. As a result, it\u2019s not really well-suited for light travel. Dragging it to the playground for some tunes while my kids played wasn\u2019t trivial, unlike the typical UE Boom I just throw in a bag while walking out the door.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s best to view the Move as a speaker that you can easily move from place to place in your home or from inside your house to your outside patio, as opposed to something you\u2019ll really want to travel with. Sonos designed a handle into the speaker\u2019s molded plastic shell, making it easy to quickly pick it up and place it down in a new location, but it isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll want to carry the Move around by on long trips.\n\nThe Move\u2019s size and weight make it cumbersome to travel with\n\nCompared to the popular Sonos One speaker, the Move is a bit taller and has an oval shape instead of a rounded square. Most of that size difference is due to the battery in the base of the Move. The actual drivers (one woofer and one tweeter) in the Move aren\u2019t much larger or more powerful than the One\u2019s. It\u2019s also considerably taller than Apple\u2019s HomePod, though it doesn\u2019t take up any more shelf space. The Move\u2019s size isn\u2019t much of an issue inside the home \u2014 you\u2019ll need about as much space for this as you do for a HomePod or Sonos One \u2014 but it\u2019s definitely noticeable when you bring the Move on the go.\n\nIn a pleasant surprise, the battery in the Move is replaceable, so when it eventually stops holding a charge, you can swap it out for a new one. Sonos says the battery should last for 900 charge cycles (or roughly three years of use), and it will be selling replacements at a later date for a to-be-announced price. The company says the Move will last about 10 hours off of a charger, and I was able to hit that mark listening to music at 50 percent volume. While 10 hours is plenty of playtime for hanging out on my patio, it is far less than what popular Bluetooth speakers provide, though you can run the Move off of a USB-C power bank if you need even longer playtime.\n\nCharging the battery takes about three hours and is done via the oval \u201cdock\u201d that comes with the Move. There are two contact points on the back of the speaker that line up with contacts on the dock, so you just have to place the speaker down on the dock to start charging. I love this design. I didn\u2019t have to fumble with plugging in a wire to charge the speaker, and it provides a home for the Move to live in when I\u2019m not using it in other locations. The experience is just like the wireless chargers I have on my desk and nightstand for my phone.\n\nSonos is selling the Move in just one color: a grayish-black that\u2019s not as dark as the black Sonos One. It\u2019s also not any more resistant to fingerprints than the One, even though this is a speaker that\u2019s meant to be handled and moved around, not just sit in one place. I\u2019d love to see a white option, as most Sonos speakers are available in two colors, so perhaps this is something the company will offer in the future.\n\nThe design features are all appreciated, but what really matters with the Move is the sound, and that\u2019s where Sonos really delivers. The Move gets surprisingly loud and is able to fill even large rooms without sounding like it\u2019s struggling or overwhelmed. Its sound output is closer to a Sonos One than a Sonos Play:5, with perhaps just a little more volume than the One. You can hear the bass coming from the Move, but you can\u2019t feel it the way you can with a Play:5. But you can\u2019t take that Play:5 outside with you, either.\n\nThe Move has a downward-firing tweeter, which is designed to provide an omnidirectional soundstage, so you can hear the music regardless of where you\u2019re positioned in relation to the speaker. Compared to the One, which has a front-firing tweeter, the Move does envelop a room with sound a little better, and it doesn\u2019t rely on you being in the \u201csweet spot\u201d for the best experience quite as much. Overall, the sound output between the One and the Move is very similar, with a punchy bass, clear highs, and warm mids.\n\nLike most Sonos speakers, the Move sounds great across a wide variety of genres and at both low and high volumes\n\nIt sounds great across a wide variety of genres and at both low and high volumes, so you don\u2019t have to crank it to 11 to really enjoy it. I really appreciate this versatility when I just want some background music in my home office or during dinner and still want to be able to carry a conversation over the music. Sonos speakers all have a similar sound signature, which is not quite clinical but very pleasing to listen to. And the Move fits right in with the rest of the lineup.\n\nI also compared the Move to Apple\u2019s HomePod, and I was surprised by how much louder the Move was able to get. At 70 percent volume, the Move easily outgunned Apple\u2019s speaker at the same settings and was able to maintain clarity just as well. The HomePod is a great-sounding speaker, but the Move actually sounds clearer and crisper to my ears and is able to maintain a louder volume to boot.\n\nImpressively, the Move doesn\u2019t lose any of its punch when it\u2019s running on battery, as opposed to being plugged into the wall. Outside, the Move is able to hold its own, projecting a lot of sound without losing it all to the atmosphere or degrading into distortion. It was surprising how similar the Move sounded no matter where I placed it, which is due in large part to Sonos\u2019 new automatic TruePlay tuning that uses the speaker\u2019s onboard mics to tune its output to whatever environment it\u2019s in.\n\nAgree to Continue: Sonos Move Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. To use the Sonos Move, and any other Sonos speaker, there\u2019s one mandatory thing you need to agree to: Sonos\u2019 privacy policy. You will be forced to agree to it while creating a Sonos account, which is required to set up a Sonos speaker. If you were hoping to bypass this by just using the Move over Bluetooth, sorry, you can\u2019t use it on Bluetooth without first setting it up with a Sonos account. There are also two optional things you need to agree to if you want to add voice controls: An Amazon account to use Alexa\n\nA Google account to use Google Assistant Final tally: one mandatory agreement and one or two optional agreements for Amazon or Google. For the latter two, these agreements extend other products that likely involve significantly more agreements.\n\nApple does a similar thing with the HomePod, and I\u2019m glad that Sonos is finally enabling it automatically, without the need to go through a convoluted setup process that involves waving a beeping iPhone around the room to acoustically map the space. The company says it\u2019s likely that automatic TruePlay will be added to other Sonos speakers that have microphones in the future.\n\nThe Move also sounds almost exactly the same whether I used it over a Bluetooth connection to my device or via the usual Wi-Fi setup. Switching between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is done by a button on the back of the speaker, and the Move will try to connect to the last device it was paired to when you switch modes. It\u2019s just as loud and enjoyable to listen to on Bluetooth versus Wi-Fi, though the automatic TruePlay tuning is only available when using the speaker on Wi-Fi. Due to the Move\u2019s large size and weight, I don\u2019t think most people will use it over Bluetooth very often, and it had no problem hanging on to my Wi-Fi network\u2019s signal when I took it outside to my patio.\n\nIf you want even more volume, you can pair two Moves together in a stereo formation, much like Sonos\u2019 other speakers. But I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d use the Move for this kind of setup, as the stereo pair will get broken whenever you move one of the speakers from its base and use it in a different location.\n\nLike the Sonos One and Beam soundbar, the Move has onboard microphones and support for either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant for voice controls. I was able to bark commands to adjust the volume, skip tracks, or control other smart home gadgets even while the Move was playing music at high volumes, and it responded without issue.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to run Alexa and Google Assistant at the same time, but the Sonos app does make it easy to switch between the two platforms whenever you want. On battery, the speaker will go to sleep after a few minutes of not being used, and it took a couple of attempts to \u201cwake\u201d it with a voice command when it\u2019s in this power-saving mode. Voice commands are also not available over Bluetooth; you have to use the Move on your Wi-Fi network to take advantage of them.\n\nBluetooth loses some features over Wi-Fi, but it still sounds great\n\nBecause the Move is a Sonos speaker, it\u2019s compatible with almost every streaming music service available, plus services like Audible and Pocket Casts. You can play music on it through voice commands, via Sonos\u2019 app, directly through Spotify using Spotify Connect, or via AirPlay 2 on an Apple device. If you have a receiver or turntable plugged into other Sonos devices, like a Connect or a Play:5, you can play that music through the Move, too. As you\u2019d expect, you can also group the Move with other Sonos speakers in your home for simultaneous whole-home listening. If you\u2019re paired to the Move over Bluetooth, whatever audio app you have on your phone will now play through the Move, just as you\u2019d expect with any other Bluetooth speaker.\n\nWhile most of my experience testing the Move was positive, it wasn\u2019t all perfect. I had some significant problems getting Alexa and Google Assistant to play music through the Move due to some apparent incompatibilities between the Move and my mesh router system, which I was able to eventually resolve by forcing the Move to connect to the main router node during setup. Sonos says the problems I encountered were out of the ordinary, and other reviewers I spoke to said they had no issues getting the Move up and fully operational on their networks, so your mileage may vary here. When everything did get set up correctly, the experience was great. But it took a lot of time and work with Sonos\u2019 support team to get there, and the app wasn\u2019t very helpful when troubleshooting the problems. I also have not encountered any issues with other Sonos speakers on this network, so something must be different with the Move\u2019s Wi-Fi hardware or configuration.\n\nThe biggest question that most people seem to have about the Move is about whether it\u2019s worth the nearly $400 price tag. Frankly, it\u2019s a tough price to swallow for what largely amounts to a $200 Sonos One with a battery bolted to the bottom of it. It\u2019s also a lot more money than the typical Bluetooth speaker costs. But the Move also does things that no other Sonos speaker nor any other Bluetooth speaker can do, and it does it all without compromising on sound quality, volume, or features.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a truly portable Bluetooth speaker to take to the park or the beach, the Move is not the right solution. But if you\u2019ve been wanting the ability to take your Sonos speaker out to the patio, down to the basement, in the garage, or anywhere else where you don\u2019t need a full-time dedicated speaker but where you want to occasionally listen to music, then the Move is exactly the thing you\u2019ve been looking for.\n\nI have a feeling a lot of people have been wanting just that kind of speaker. I\u2019m one of them. We\u2019re just going to have to pay $400 to get it.\n\nPhotography by Dan Seifert / The Verge", "description": "Sonos has finally come out with a speaker that you can take outside of the house: the Move.
