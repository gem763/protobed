Whether it\u2019s opioids ... or human smuggling on the other side ... you want to know who that person is.\u201d\n\nBlanco told the audience that it is not that hard to obtain that information. \u201cAll we\u2019re asking for is name, address, account number, transaction, recipient, and amount,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cSo when you tell me you don\u2019t know who\u2019s on the other side, you\u2019ve got a big problem. Because you are required to know, and that is what our expectation is going to be.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the chairmen of the three primary financial regulators in the U.S. released a joint statement warning crypto users of AML and Combating the Financing of Terrorism obligations, reminding crypto companies that they are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Blanco said in this regard:\n\n\"Your BSA obligations are still going to be there [...] Whether you're stablecoin, centralized, decentralized \u2014 [it] doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll still have to be able to comply.\"\n\nAlthough Blanco did not address Facebook\u2019s Libra stablecoin, he did make it clear that as far as FinCEN is concerned, there is no distinction between stablecoins and any other types of cryptocurrency.\n\nFinCEN was directed by Congress to study blockchain tech\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill that calls for FinCEN to study blockchain technology in its fight against financial crime. The bill requires director Kenneth Blanco to carry out a study on the use of emerging technologies, such as blockchain technology, within FinCEN.", "description": "FinCEN Director Kenneth Blanco says that the agency expects fintech firms that provide anonymous services to comply with Anti-Money Laundering standards", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9hYTQ4OThmOTkwMWEyODY5MWYwOWMyMjU1Njk0MTVkYS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
