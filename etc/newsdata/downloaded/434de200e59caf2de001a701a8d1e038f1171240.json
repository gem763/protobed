Turkish Markets Rally as Erdogan Clinches Syria Deal With U.S.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The jumped to its strongest level in almost two weeks while bonds and stocks rallied after the U.S. agreed not to impose any further sanctions on Turkey as part of a temporary cease-fire deal in Syria struck between Ankara and Washington on Thursday.\n\nThe currency gained as much as 1.3% to 5.7585 per dollar, erasing losses that were fueled in recent days by concern Washington would impose punitive measures against the Turkish economy in response to the offensive against Kurdish rebels in Syria.\n\nThe benchmark stock gauge jumped almost 4% at the open, its biggest advance since June. The yield on five-year benchmark bonds dropped more than 160 basis points, falling below 15% for the first time in a week.\n\n\u201cThe truce deal, even a temporary one, fueled optimism among investors that the risk of sanctions has diminished significantly,\u201d said Can Oksun, senior manager of institutional sales at Global Securities in Istanbul. \u201cThe mood is broadly more positive.\u201d\n\nThe agreement enshrines Turkish control of a 20-mile deep \u201csafe zone\u201d in northern Syria, representing a victory for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had been seeking one for years. The U.S. has also promised to withdraw sanctions announced earlier this week once a permanent cease-fire takes effect.\n\n\u2018Brutal\u2019 House Bill\n\nStill, risks remain. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have vowed to move ahead with sanctions despite Thursday\u2019s announcement. The measures would penalize Turkish leaders, financial institutions and its energy sector, as well as prohibit any U.S. firms or individuals from buying the country\u2019s sovereign debt.\n\n\u201cIf this bill holds as is and is passed it would be brutal,\u201d said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. \u201cSanctioning sovereign debt would be lights out for Turkey, given it has $180 billion in short-term external debt to finance every year.\u201d\n\nWhile there is strong bipartisan opposition to Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria, Senate leaders haven\u2019t committed to bringing a sanctions bill to a vote.\n\nThe lira was trading 0.9% stronger at 5.7803 per dollar as of 10:53 a.m. in Istanbul. The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index trimmed its advance to 3.5%, with gains being led by Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS and Akbank TAS, the nation\u2019s largest listed lenders.", "description": "Turkish Markets Rally as Erdogan Clinches Syria Deal With U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBB70M3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
