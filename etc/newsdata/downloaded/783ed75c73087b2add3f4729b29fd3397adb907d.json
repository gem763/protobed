their demands to include democratic reforms.\n\n\"It would perhaps be not the most cost-effective way to use government resources to launch any campaign to rebuild Hong Kong's reputation, but sooner or later, we will have to do it because I have every confidence in Hong Kong's fundamentals,\" Ms Lam told a news conference Tuesday.\n\n\"The time will come for us to launch a major campaign to restore some of the damage done to Hong Kong's reputation.\"\n\nHong Kong's economy, already reeling from the US-China trade war, is facing its first recession in years, with tourist arrivals plunging
