Her son, who was unaware of the scheme, reportedly got a 35 out of 36 on the test.\n\n\u201cI committed this crime for myself,\u201d she wrote in a letter to the court. \u201cNot because I wanted my son to go to any particular school, but because I needed to make myself feel like a better mother.\u201d\n\nNearly a dozen other parents, including Emmy Award-winning actress Felicity Huffman, have also received prison time in the wide-ranging FBI case dubbed Operation Varsity Blues. Investigators have charged more than 50 defendants nationwide.\n\nHuffman was sentenced to two weeks in prison after she confessed to paying a Harvard graduate $15,000 to correct her eldest daughter\u2019s answers on the SAT, which secured her a 400-point bump on the college entrance exam. She reported to a federal prison in Dublin, Calif., last week.\n\nOthers, including Full House actress Lori Loughlin, have pleaded not guilty in the sprawling federal case. Loughlin was charged on Tuesday with additional counts in a new indictment that alleges she conspired to commit federal program bribery. Prosecutors have said Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, paid the scheme\u2019s ringleader Rick Singer nearly $500,000 to get their daughters into the University of Southern California as purported crew recruits.\n\nBuckingham, a single mom, reportedly choked up as she apologized in court on Wednesday and has said she has \u201cabsolutely no excuse\u201d for her actions. Her lawyer requested probation, and prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence her to six months in prison.\n\n\u201cUnlike other defendants, this defendant orchestrated a complete fraud, none of her son\u2019s score was his own and that\u2019s how she planned it,\" prosecutor Justin O\u2019Connell reportedly said in court.", "description": "Jane Buckingham was sentenced to three weeks in prison and a $40,000 fine for paying a test proctor to take her son\u2019s ACT.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1716,w_3051,x_0,y_182/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571864564/RTS2SIMG_1_uhqvdf", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
