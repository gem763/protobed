Prices start at $245 for a flight from Oakland to San Jose and climb as high as $425 from San Francisco International Airport to Napa.\n\nRead more: I took a $120 Blade helicopter flight from midtown Manhattan to JFK Airport \u2014 here's what it was like\n\n\"The key with Voom is that we have Airbus to understand how these markets behave,\" Monnet said, brushing off the intense competition from the bevy traditional helicopter chartering services.\n\nUber's launch in particular, he says, \"is great because it validates the assumptions we made three years ago when we decided that the best way to make UAM a reality was to incorporate first with helicopter as prep for the arrival of EVToL (Electric, vertical takeoff and landing).\"\n\nEarlier this year, Airbus' other UAM subsidiary showed off its vision for a flying taxi. The \"Vahana\" is an all-electric, four-seat aircraft, and successfully completed 50 full-scale test flights, the company said.\n\nVoom declined to share ridership or revenue figures thus far, but Monnet said the company has shuttled \"tens of thousands\" of passengers in Mexico and Brazil so far. More cities are in the company's sights, he said, though any announcements are still under wraps.\n\n\"We want to make Voom the platform of reference for Urban Air,\" Monnet said. \"Thanks to our experience working in previous markets, and leveraging Airbus' expertise to work with the best in class operators in the world so that we can safely integrate with any type of platform to offer mobility services to passengers.\"", "description": "Airbus' Voom will provide helicopter flights around the San Francisco Bay area for prices that are competitive with Uber and Blade.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8e528f2e22af7e885ad744-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
