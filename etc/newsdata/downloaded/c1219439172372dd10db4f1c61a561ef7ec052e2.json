These allow foreigners to take legal action against Australia if their commercial interests are hurt by government policy action.\n\nThe government will consider separate legislation to render void a 1993 bilateral investment agreement and its ISDS clause, which had no safeguards.\n\nUnder the new FTA, the ISDS comes with safeguards to do away with frivolous claims and carve-outs to protect claims against Australia in any area of public health.\n\nThis, for example, protects the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from challenge by a foreign government, and decisions such as that taken in 2011 to introduce plain packaging for tobacco.\n\nThe government has also been asked to consider having future FTAs subject to modelling by the Productivity Commission, and to consult more closely with Labor and unions during the negotiation phase. It has yet to agree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not support an additional call by Labor that should the agreement involve Indonesia sending workers to Australia for an Indonesian-backed project, the local job market would have to be tested first.\n\nTrade Minister Simon Birmingham said at a time of global economic uncertainty driven by the US-China trade dispute, ratifying the FTAs was more important than ever.\n\n\u201cThese free-trade deals also send a positive signal that Australia supports an open, global, and rules-based trading system \u2013 a message that is more important than ever before given the current global trade headwinds,'' he said.\n\n\u201cIf Labor are genuine in their arguments that Australia should defend the rules-based trading system, engage more deeply with Indonesia and diversify our export markets, then they should support the legislation required to implement these agreements, which deliver against all of those objectives.\u201d\n\nLabor MP Peter Khalil, who was the senior Labor member on the treaties committee, said the concessions obtained on ISDS and consultation \"reflect Labor principles on trade\".\n\n\u201cIt is important for us to develop our economic ties with Indonesia. In a decade it will be the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, and it\u2019s a market of 260 million people on our doorstep, yet it accounts for only 2 per cent of our exports currently.\u201d", "description": "Labor is poised to pass legislation ratifying\u00a0free trade agreements with Indonesia and Hong Kong after winning some concessions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2534%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_22%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3603fac072f7dcef194923c599f3e9d34c90c176", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
