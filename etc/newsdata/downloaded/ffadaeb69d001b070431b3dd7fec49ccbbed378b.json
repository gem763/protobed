The Movie Week extravaganza took in blockbuster hits and box office flops.\n\nHere are all the talking points and social media reaction from Sunday night's results show\u2026\n\nAnneka Rice was gracious loser but deserved to go\n\nMany viewers would have been saddened to see Eighties TV favourite Anneka Rice bow out so early but let\u2019s face it, she deserved to depart the dancefloor for that lumpen, leaden-footed routine. As judge Bruno Tonioli declared, it \u201cwasn\u2019t so much Kill Bill as Slaughter The Charleston\u201d.\n\nPoor Anneka struggled with timing, bounce, the crucial swivel and those martial arts props, looking as wooden as the kendo stick she was wielding. Indeed, it was often hard to tell which dance she was performing as she jogged and plodded around the ballroom floor. She promptly scored 11 points, her lowest yet, and such a low total sealed her fate.\n\nAnneka took all the panel\u2019s criticism with a gracious smile and was winningly self-deprecating, jokingly comparing herself to \u201cthe Ann Widdecombe figure\u201d She came into the contest admitting she wasn\u2019t sure if she had any dancing ability because she\u2019d never really tried and that her yoga teacher calls her \u201cStiff Annie\u201d.\n\nHer flat-footed cha-cha in week one was almost as bad as her Charleston but it was the dance in between which was Anneka\u2019s high point: a smooth, simple waltz full of sweet storytelling and elegant glide. Anneka looked much more comfortable in hold, so it\u2019s a shame we won\u2019t get to see her do ballroom again.\n\nStill, at least she won\u2019t have to face her aversion to frocks any more and can get back into comfy trousers.", "description": "And action!", "authors": ["Michael Hogan", "Victoria Coren Mitchell", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000212110259-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnovVTiJx1-CJOCPnC8SeZ1q8dTvX9FttOea5MabsGgY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
