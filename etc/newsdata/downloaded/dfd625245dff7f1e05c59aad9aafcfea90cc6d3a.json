Against a good Ravens defense, Mahomes led three second-quarter touchdown drives that included TD passes to Demarcus Robinson and rookie Mecole Hardman.\n\nRobinson\u2019s brilliant fingertip grab in the corner of the end zone was a reminder of just how potent this Chiefs offense can be, even in a game where the team didn\u2019t have its starting running back (Damien Williams), No. 1 receiver (Tyreek Hill) and starting left tackle (Eric Fisher).\n\nMahomes finished the game 27-of-37 passing for 374 yards and three TDs.\n\nPatrick Mahomes was brilliant against the Baltimore Ravens.

After leading a brilliant 14-play, 84-yard drive on their first possession, the Ravens gave a glimpse of their aggressive gameplan to come. Head coach John Harbaugh went for the two-point conversion (which failed) \u2014 an unusually aggressive approach so early in the game.\n\nIt was a sign the Ravens knew what they were up against with a dangerous Chiefs team at Arrowhead Stadium. Harbaugh also would go for it on fourth down four times in the game, converting three of them.\n\nThe Ravens also took another unorthodox approach, later going for two after a Mark Ingram touchdown run \u2014 his third of the game \u2014 put them down 30-19. That try missed, and the Chiefs kicked a late field goal to make it a two-score game with 4:39 remaining.\n\nStory continues\n\nJackson still showed extremely well in his best test of the season. Despite missing on some passes early, he kept the Ravens alive with his athleticism and some creativity. Jackson led the Ravens on a quick scoring drive by running for a brilliant score with 2:01 remaining. The two-point try was no good.\n\nJackson finished the game 22-of-43 passing for 267 yards and running eight times for 46 yards and a TD, with the stats not fully telling the story of how he dazzled at times.\n\nOne of the more improbable completions was a fourth-and-5, run-around prayer for a conversion that set up the Ravens\u2019 final score. Jackson also completed a miracle heave to Willie Snead on 3rd and 17 that went down as a 23-yard completion, but it certainly won\u2019t pass scrutiny when the coaches review the tape on Monday.\n\nStill, Jackson kept the Ravens in the game \u2014 one where the final score might not have been indicative of how the game actually went. Justin Tucker attempted a bizarre drop kick on the kickoff after the Ravens\u2019 final TD, but the Chiefs recovered and were able to run down the clock after Mahomes converted a late first down.\n\nAggression, talent, big plays \u2014 this game had it all. And a big reason why where the two star quarterbacks involved.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson put on a show, living up to the big hype entering the game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BIDRA_AWxTDhecu1dAqBew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YUPfBs9kjDP.hdZtATXo0w--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/1812ace0-dd75-11e9-af6e-d77176e8b547", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
