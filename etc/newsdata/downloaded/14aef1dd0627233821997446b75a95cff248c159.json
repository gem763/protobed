The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.

But Johnson said that Trump denied that was the case when he followed up with the president on his own.\n\nSondland is shown defending Trump in other text messages that Volker provided to Congress.\n\nIn one message from just days before the Trump-Zelensky call on July 25, Taylor warned that \"Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\"\n\nSondland replied, \"Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.\"\n\nOn Sept. 1, Taylor asked Sondland about the prerequisites for a White House visit by Zelensky.\n\n\"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Taylor asked.\n\n\"Call me,\" Sondland replied.\n\nA week later, Sondland texted Volker and Taylor that there had been \"multiple convos with Ze, Potus\" and suggested they speak over the phone to discuss.\n\n\"The nightmare is they give the interview and don't get the security assistance. The Russians love it. (And I quit.),\" Taylor wrote.\n\nSondland is also mentioned in the intelligence community whistleblower complaint, which said Sondland accompanied Volker to meetings in Kiev with Zelensky and other Ukrainian political figures providing advice about how to \"navigate\" Trump's demands.\n\nThe complaint also said Sondland and Volker had spoken with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Former George W.

The two diplomats allegedly met with members of the Ukrainian government to help them understand the different messages they were receiving from \"official U.S. channels on the one hand and from Mr. Giuliani on the other.\"\n\nSondland wasn't always so aligned with Trump.\n\nIn the 2016 cycle, he initially backed Jeb Bush in the GOP primary, giving $25,000 to the PAC supporting the former Florida governor. And in an episode widely reported by local news outlets at the time, Sondland was among several regional executives to cancel an appearance at a Trump fundraiser in Seattle just months before the elections, largely to protest Trump's attacks on the parents of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq.\n\nWhen Trump won the White House, Sondland changed his tune, donating $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee. He was nominated for the E.U. ambassador post in May 2018, and the Senate confirmed him with bipartisan support a month later.\n\nSondland has lent financial support to both political parties, spanning almost four decades, though the donations have tilted heavily toward Republicans, to whom he has given more than $450,000, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe three House committees \u2014 Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight \u2014 are still trying to secure dates for depositions with other potential witnesses for their impeachment inquiry, including George Kent, the State Department\u2019s deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, and State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl.\n\nThey have also requested depositions with three of Giuliani\u2019s business associates \u2014 Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Semyon Kislin \u2014 but so far none have been confirmed. The attorney for Parnas and Fruman said Monday that they would not comply with the requests.\n\nBut Marie Yovanovitch, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until May when the Trump administration recalled her from the post, is set to testify in closed session on Friday, committee aides said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Trump ordered Yovanovitch\u2019s removal after Giuliani and other outside allies said she was undermining efforts to persuade the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cWe need to learn more about what exactly was done within the State Department to visit retribution on people who weren't on the Giuliani train,\u201d Rep.
