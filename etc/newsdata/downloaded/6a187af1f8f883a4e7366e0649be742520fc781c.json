The corner said cannabis was also detected in his blood.\n\nRick died in August 2018 (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nDuring the police investigation, it was previously reported he may have died by suicide, however friends and family denied suggestions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGenest\u2019s manager Karim Leduc said on Monday following the findings: \u2018Rick was always somebody who had a lot of ambition, he was someone who had a lot of ideas for new projects and certainly we had things scheduled. It made absolutely no sense.\u2019\n\nHowever, Gagnon mentioned in her report that she cannot rule out suicide when it comes to the performer\u2019s death.\n\nShe added, though, Genest \u2018did not seem to be in a state of psychosis or delirium when he went out on the balcony to smoke\u2019.\n\nGagnon concluded: \u2018After analysis, given that the investigation did not reveal a clear and unequivocal intention to end his life on Mr Genest\u2019s part, I cannot state that the death was a suicide.\u2019\n\nAdding of the accidental nature she found, the coroner continued: \u2018Some of Mr Genest\u2019s close friends indicated that he had a habit of sitting on the railing of the building\u2019s balcony when he went out to smoke.\u2019\n\nThe model rose to international fame thanks to his striking tattoos, which gave him the appearance of a corpse, and his appearance in Lady Gaga\u2019s Born This Way video.\n\nGenest also starred in a number of movies including 47 Ronin opposite Keanu Reeves.\n\nNeed support?
