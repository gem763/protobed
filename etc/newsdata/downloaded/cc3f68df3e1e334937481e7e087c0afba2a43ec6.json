But in the case of Chromebooks, shortcuts can also help new users cope with some of the differences between the design of the Chromebook and other systems, such as Macs and Windows PCs.\n\nFor example, instead of the usual Caps Lock key that most keyboards have, Chromebooks have a Launcher key, which is used to bring up the Launcher (the equivalent of the Mac Launchpad or the Windows Start Menu). If you prefer to reinstate the Caps Lock (as I usually do), you can use the keyboard shortcut Alt + Launcher to change the Launcher into a Caps Lock key, or you can combine the Launcher and the Backspace key to do a forward delete.\n\nThere are quite a few of these useful keyboard shortcuts, and you don\u2019t have to know them by heart. Just use the following keyboard combination:\n\nCtrl + Alt + /\n\nThat will bring up a window that contains all of the shortcuts you can use, divided into categories. There is also a search window so you can search for, say, \u201cclose,\u201d and you\u2019ll find ways to close the current tab or the current window by just using your keyboard.\n\nOne suggestion, though: when you do a search for a keyboard shortcut, start with a single search term. When I typed the word \u201cclose,\u201d I got the answers I needed. But when I typed the phrase \u201cclose tab,\u201d nothing came up because the phrase that the shortcuts list uses is \u201cClose the current tab.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it!", "description": "In the case of Chromebooks, keyboard shortcuts can help new users cope with some of the differences between the design of the Chromebook and other systems, such as Macs and Windows PCs.", "authors": ["Barbara Krasnoff", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8C7BNGg08ED2R8_imS6aVaHRnjM=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9379045/jbareham_170921_2006_0441.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
