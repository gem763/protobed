I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nFar from clearing up the confusion, LeBron\u2019s tweets seem to only add to it.\n\nIf the Lakers star merely had an issue with the timing of Morey\u2019s tweet, he could have just said that. Instead, James said that Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand.\u201d Which sounds a lot more like James had issue with the substance of Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting that LeBron \u2013 not a college graduate \u2013 believes that Morey \u2013 a graduate of Northwestern and MIT \u2013 \u201cwasn\u2019t educated\u201d on the issue. Does LeBron believe he knows more about the issues between Hong Kong and mainland China than Morey does? Morey\u2019s tweet was simply a message of support for democracy. Does James believe the alternative to democracy is the better alternative? If democracy is the best answer (it is) then why would anyone need to be reeducated for supporting it?\n\nNot to mention James\u2019 lamenting of the NBA\u2019s \u201chard week\u201d in China, while pro-democracy demonstrators were facing violent police crackdowns in some cases less than 50 miles from the luxury hotels where NBA players were staying.\n\nLeBron James will likely get many opportunities to answer these questions in the coming days. In taking a story that was fading from the headlines and breathing new life into it, James has needlessly and recklessly reignited the flames of the NBA-China controversy. Moreover, in defending China and attacking Morey, he has thrown his weight behind a ruthlessly oppressive dictatorship which stands against every principle he has spent the last few years claiming to believe in.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "On Tuesday night, NBA star and social justice warrior LeBron James said that Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey \"wasn't educated,\"", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images_Zhizhao-Wu-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
