Experts Weigh In", "language": "en", "text": "Twitter can\u2019t tell us whether, or how, Tuesday\u2019s CNN/New York Times debate might change voters\u2019 minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.\n\nHere is a sampling of their reactions.\n\nWarren took fire from all sides\n\nThe strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else\u2019s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.\n\n\u201cWarren took almost everyone\u2019s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.\u201d \u2014 Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton \u201cHeading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.\u201d \u2014 Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman \u201cThis is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she\u2019s the one who is setting the tone and she\u2019s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.\u201d \u2014 Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics\n\nButtigieg stood out \u2026\n\nSeveral consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.\n\n\u201cVery strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.\u201d \u2014 David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama \u201cI am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.\u201d \u2014 Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance \u201cThis has been @PeteButtigieg\u2019s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.\u201d \u2014 Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster\n\n\u2026 and so did Klobuchar\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.\n\n\u201c@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don\u2019t subscribe to most left views. It\u2019s a theme that\u2019s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama \u201cWith 11 other people on stage, you don\u2019t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she\u2019s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.\u201d \u2014 Mo Elleithee \u201cEvery time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it\u2019s nice to hear.\u201d \u2014 Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton\n\nSanders was reassuring\n\nAfter his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.\n\n\u201cWhat heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.\u201d \u2014 Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign \u201cBernie Sanders making a damn important point here \u2014 stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.\u201d \u2014 Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist \u201cThis was @BernieSanders\u2019 best debate by far, but I still don\u2019t hear him making a pitch to people who don\u2019t already support him.\u201d \u2014 Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator\n\nBiden had an uneven performance\n\nMr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy \u2014 frequently a strong area for him \u2014 but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren\u2019s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\u201cBiden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked \u2018did you make a mistake?\u2019 he snaps back with a much sharper line.\u201d \u2014 Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.\u201d \u2014 Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton \u201cBiden yelling \u2018I GOT you votes\u2019 at Warren is not the best look.\u201d \u2014 Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University\u2019s Center for American Women and Politics\n\nOther standout moments\n\nSeveral other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro for the statement, \u201cPolice violence is also gun violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women\u2019s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.\u201d \u2014 Kelly Dittmar \u201c@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.\u201d \u2014 Adrienne Elrod \u201cCastro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.\u201d \u2014 Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver\n\nThe bottom line", "description": "Elizabeth Warren fielded all the attacks that being a front-runner brings, and Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar made their cases as moderate alternatives.", "authors": ["Maggie Astor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/us/politics/16debate-whowon/16debate-whowon-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
