In the UK, nine out of 10 teenagers use social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook and Whatsapp.\n\nImage copyright Philipp Lipiarski Image caption The museum will be open for about six months and could move to other cities\n\nThe museum is filled with interactive exhibits which, Ms Scharinger says, invite people to really have fun.\n\nThere are 24 different rooms at the museum. Visitors can take pictures in front of various different-coloured walls for the perfect outfit snap.\n\nThere are also ball pits, floral walls and glitter confetti, designed for creative selfies. There is even a room filled with fake food such as cupcakes and macaroons.\n\nImage copyright Philipp Lipiarski Image caption Co-creators Nils Peper and Petra Scharinger in the ball pit room\n\nNofilter_museum joins a number of establishments across the world targeting heavy users of social media.\n\nA number of major influencers have already expressed interest in coming to the museum for shoots.\n\nBut the idea of attracting influencers is controversial, because of the often close relationship between popular influencers and brands. Much advertising on social media is subtle or even subliminal.\n\nThe Museum of Ice Cream in the US has proved popular with Instagram influencers and has more than 390,000 followers on its own Instagram account.\n\nThe company behind that museum has since been valued at $200m (\u00a3161m), according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nImage copyright Philipp Lipiarski Image caption Instagram has inspired a number of social media-friendly exhibitions\n\nBased on the figures from other social media-friendly museums, Ms Scharinger, a business graduate, expects around 300-500 people a day to visit her museum.\n\n\"I think it's the future of museums,\" she says. \"The main point is that it's not only about selfies, but also about having a good time, being able to interact while experiencing art.\n\nImage copyright Philipp Lipiarski Image caption Some influencers have already expressed interest in photo shoots at the museum\n\n\"I do think that people spend a lot of time on their phones and that's why we try to combine that with something real and something fun. But I don't think it is our responsibility to educate them,\" she adds.\n\nThe museum is temporary, however; Ms Scharinger and co-creator Nils Peper hope to take it on tour to other cities and countries.", "description": "A new Instagram-friendly museum in Vienna invites young people to be \"part of the art\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/144B9/production/_109092138_-cphilipplipiarski-4155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
