The hires in question, data specialists Eric Mayefsky and Nina Wornhoff, were recommended to campaign manager Mike Schmuhl by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.\n\nThe campaign has aggressively fought back against allegations of even a whiff of impropriety, noting that Zuckerberg\u2019s emails were sent at the applicants\u2019 request, and that Buttigieg\u2019s team had received more than 7,000 job applications between Buttigieg\u2019s breakout appearance on a CNN town hall in March and his campaign\u2019s official launch the following month.\n\n\u201cOther people we have gotten staff recommendations from: former Presidents, civil rights leaders, members of Congress, Pete\u2019s high school teacher,\u201d tweeted Lis Smith, Buttigieg\u2019s communications director. \u201cWe make staff decisions on how to build the best team in politics, which I\u2019m proud to report we have!\u201d\n\nUsers Flee Facebook Over Privacy Concerns. Facebook\u2019s Solution? All-Seeing Eye.\n\nBut as some fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls call for the government to potentially break up large tech companies, and Facebook\u2019s leadership continues to defend the company\u2019s position that politicians should be considered exempt from its rules regarding hate speech, harassment and false advertising, the relationship between Buttigieg and Silicon Valley is under renewed scrutiny.\n\nFor Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose political life has been defined by curbing corporate power, the appearance of any coziness between Zuckerberg and a political campaign\u2014particularly one that\u2019s hot on her tail in Iowa\u2014is bad enough as it is, regardless of the fact that the two staffers hired were not in political roles.\n\n\u201cMy views on Mark Zuckerberg are pretty clear: He runs a company that has too much political power,\u201d Warren told a gaggle of reporters on Monday, when asked about the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 exchange. \u201cThey already have way too much influence in Washington and they are helping drive every conversation in a way that will protect Mark Zuckerberg and his company but that undermines our democracy. That is why I have said I think it\u2019s time to enforce the antitrust laws that are already on the books\u2014we need to break up these big tech companies.\u201d\n\nWarren has pointed to Facebook\u2019s outsized influence and alleged disinterest in preventing the spread of fake news as evidence that the company has failed to learn the lessons of the 2016 presidential campaign, when pages dedicated to sharing fake news\u2014sometimes with the assistance or orchestration of the Russian government\u2014targeted voters in the lead-up to the election.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Mark,\u201d Warren tweeted last week, after Zuckerberg gave a defensive address at Georgetown University. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t just posting a lie on his own page for his own followers. Facebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies\u2026 Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again\u2014and profit off of it.\u201d\n\nBy one measure, at least, Buttigieg is far and away the preferred candidate of Facebook\u2019s employees. According to a review of Federal Election Commission data by The Daily Beast, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, raked in $23,095.36 in donations from Facebook employees in the first six months of 2019, a sum that includes checks written by some of the company\u2019s most senior employees. David Marcus, the former president of PayPal and current head of Facebook Messenger, donated $2,800 to Buttigieg the day before he officially launched his campaign; Naomi Gleit, senior director of the growth, engagement, and mobile team at Facebook and the company\u2019s vice president of \u201csocial good,\u201d also donated $2,800.\n\nOther high-level donors from Facebook\u2019s upper ranks include Maz Sharafi, global head of marketing for WhatsApp ($2,000), Victoria Grand, WhatsApp\u2019s vice president of policy and communications ($2,000), and Elliot Schrage, the company\u2019s former vice president of global communications, marketing, and public policy who led its response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal ($2,000).", "description": "Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photos GettyIn the spring of 2004, when Facebook was little more than an online portal for students at Harvard University to stalk their crushes, senior Pete Buttigieg was the website\u2019s 287th user.Fifteen years later, the relationship between the world", "authors": ["Scott Bixby"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/05BL9OQx9mq1zOBb_GG85g--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/4e819ba72442f82fd2e9aa56c6ca0514", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
