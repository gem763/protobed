The U.K., Bahrain and Australia are the only countries to join the U.S led-operation in the strait \u2014 through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes in transit.\n\nBoth Germany and France have publicly rejected the U.S.\u2019s request to join its mission, with EU diplomats expressing concern that doing so could escalate tensions between Iran, Washington and EU countries. London, Paris and Berlin are all signatories to the international nuclear deal struck with Iran during Barack Obama\u2019s time as U.S. president, from which Donald Trump later withdrew.\n\nFrance and Germany previously discussed launching a European initiative, which would be \u201caimed at defusing tensions and facilitating de-escalation. It differs from the American approach of maximum pressure,\u201d a spokeswoman for the French ministry of foreign affairs said last month.\n\nMogherini said the EU initiative announced Thursday is \u201cfirst conceived from our side a few months ago\u201d and is \u201cnot in particular related to the tensions around the Gulf of the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d\n\nStating that maritime security is under threat from \u201cgrowing geostrategic rivalries\u201d as well as piracy and organized crime, the EU diplomat said: \u201cWe are seeing a growing demand for the European Union role as maritime security provider not only in our region but also further away, [for example] Asia or the Pacific, the Indian Ocean.\u201d\n\nThe ships involved will remain under the command of their national authorities, she said, adding it would not substitute EU military operations but would be \u201can additional tool.\u201d She said she hopes the concept will be finalized in the next couple of months.", "description": "Expanding the initiative to the Strait of Hormuz \u2018could be an option.\u2019", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Zia Weise", "Zoya Sheftalovich"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/h_55355401-1200x628.jpg"}
