Goldman Sachs had opened its new \u00a31 billion European headquarters in July, just over three years since the UK voted to leave the EU. While in January, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief executive, James Gorman, reportedly said during an analyst call that he is hardly concerned about Brexit: \u201cThat\u2019s not in my top 200 issues today.\u201d\n\nOn the ground, senior bankers are reportedly not looking to move to mainland Europe after Brexit, as project fear reports had claimed before the 2016 vote. One chief executive of a top European bank told Reuters he would even consider a 20 per cent salary cut to stay in London.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you are an Italian banker, who moved out to London 20 years ago, and your kids go to private school around the corner then you are not going to move to Frankfurt.\u201d\n\nBrexodus?

London is the largest net exporter of financial services in the world. The city overtook New York City as a top destination for fin-tech (financial technology).
