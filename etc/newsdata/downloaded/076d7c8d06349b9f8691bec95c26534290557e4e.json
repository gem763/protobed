The city's 413 murders so far this year is high compared to other US cities, but it's nowhere near the brutality and scale of violence in Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2018, according to the UN peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan, 3,804 civilians were killed in conflict, including 927 children. In recent months, terrorist attacks by both the Taliban and ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) have brutalised Afghans and horrified the international community.\n\nIn June, the Australia-based think tank Institute for Economics and Peace released its 2019 Global Peace Index, ranking Afghanistan as the least peaceful country in the world.\n\nThe IEP, which develops methods to \"analyse peace and to quantify its economic value,\" has released the GPI annually since 2007. The index measures the peacefulness of 162 countries by rating each one on 23 qualitative and quantitative metrics - such as deaths from conflict, violent crime, and access to weapons - which are divided into three categories.\n\nIn 2019, overall global peacefulness increased for the first time in five years, but the world is still less peaceful than it was 10 years ago, the report says. This year, Afghanistan replaced Syria as the least peaceful country in the world.\n\nRussia makes the top 10 list of least peaceful countries.\n\nRussia has one of the highest per capita rates of weapons exports, according to the report, and is highly militarised, which partially explains its rank on this list.\n\nIts engagement in the Syrian conflict increased the country's number of deaths from external conflict, and overall approval of its leadership declined from 35% to just over 30% from 2008 to 2018.\n\nIt is the least peaceful country in its region, according to the report.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is at high risk for severe flooding, contributing to the likelihood of future conflict.\n\nViolence in the DRC is interfering with health workers' ability to treat the country's most recent Ebola outbreak, which has claimed 1,396 lives in that country, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nGangs and militia groups attack healthcare facilities, killing a Cameroonian doctor working to control the outbreak earlier this year.\n\nRising violence in Libya, coupled with its high risk for flooding, make it the eighth-least peaceful country in the world.\n\nViolence in the Central African Republic costs the country approximately 47% of its GDP.\n\nSeleka rebels and Anti-Balaka militia members continue to clash in the Central African Republic, pushing the country into chaos and creating an internally displaced population of 620,000, with 570,000 refugees headed to neighbouring countries like Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to Reuters.\n\nSomalia is at significant risk for drought, making the country more prone to conflict.\n\nIn 2018, Iraq saw a decrease in state-backed violence and in the number of refugees and internally displaced persons as a percentage of its population.\n\nStill, Iraq deals with significant conflict, both internal and external. The are still remnants of ISIS, despite its official defeat, in part because divisions in Iraq's security forces have undercut efforts to eliminate the group.\n\nYemen remains the site of the world's worst humanitarian crisis, as it is still locked in a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nSouth Sudan's ongoing conflict, as well as its high risk for climate disaster, contribute to its placement in the GPI.\n\nSyria's conflicts place it high on the list, although it is no longer the least peaceful country.\n\nSyria is now GPI's second least peaceful country in the world. The GPI cites ISIS' defeat in the town of Baghuz earlier this year as key to moving the country from the first spot to the second.\n\nAfghanistan is the least peaceful country in the world, according to the index.\n\nAfghanistan was designated the least peaceful country in the world by the GPI in 2019, supplanting Syria.\n\nViolence in Afghanistan cost it 47% of its GDP, and the ongoing conflict killed 3,804 people last year, including 927 children - the highest number ever in the country, according to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.\n\nAfghan citizens feel 20% less safe than they did in 2008, according to the GPI. Confidence in the country's military has fallen by more than 31 percentage points since 2013.", "description": "The latest Global Peace Index has a new least peaceful country, assessed on metrics like political instability and deaths from conflict.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7994/db68f19c9012412ead95e201a1a8f59e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
