Landry, however, said the business is growing and has expanded this year to areas like Nashville, Orlando and Las Vegas.\n\nAmazon last week forecast revenue and profit below Wall Street's target, amid intense competition and surging costs related to its drive to speed up shipping times around the world.\n\nSales at Amazon's Whole Foods Market chain and other physical stores stalled in the second quarter and fell 1 percent in the third quarter.\n\nProfits from grocery sales are notoriously slim. But selling staples like bananas, milk and toilet paper gives retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target Corp <TGT.N> the opportunity to upsell shoppers who make frequent visits to replenish such necessities.\n\nTuesday's move from the world's biggest online retailer is yet another salvo in the continuing delivery \"arms race,\" Charlie O'Shea of Moody's said.\n\nAmazon is already cutting delivery times to one day for its Prime loyalty members in a bid to outmaneuver Walmart and other retailers who offer competing two-day shipping without subscription fees.\n\n\"This new delivery effort is yet another example of Amazon's willingness to suffer short-term for the potential for long-term benefit,\" O'Shea added.\n\nShares in Amazon slipped 0.6% in afternoon trading, while Kroger Co <KR.N> and Walmart were down 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively.\n\nWalmart plans to offer its \"Delivery Unlimited\" grocery membership to shoppers in more than half of the United States by the end of the year. Members have the option of paying the $98 annual fee or $12.95 per month instead of the usual $9.99 delivery fee.\n\nKroger charges a $5.95 delivery fee and a $6.00 service fee to drop groceries at shopper doorsteps.\n\nA recent study from Capgemini found that 38% of U.S. consumers order groceries online, but that only 14% were willing to pay more for two-hour deliveries.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru, Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Maju Samuel, Shailesh Kuber and Sandra Maler)", "description": "Amazon is dropping its $14.99 delivery fee as Walmart - the No. 1 grocery seller in the United States - rolls out a $98 annual \"Delivery Unlimited\" grocery membership to compete with Amazon's $119 Prime delivery subscription.
