It was identified from the remains of at least four individuals.\n\nThey included the skull and spine \u2013 as well as limb and hip bones. The fossils were dug up at a dinosaur graveyard in the north eastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima.\n\nNamed Siamraptor suwati, it may have rivalled T Rex \u2013 which is now believed to have originated in Asia.\n\nIt was more than 26 feet long and weighed at least three-and-a-half tons. It belonged to a group known as the carcharodontosaurs.\n\nThese include some of the biggest known carnivorous dinosaurs \u2013 as big and ferocious as T Rex.\n\nThis is the skull of a baby T rex.\n\nSpeaking from Thailand, study lead author Dr Duangsuda Chokchaloemwong, of Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University, said:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Siamraptor would have been more than 8 metres long and weighed at least 3.5 tons.\n\n\u2018It lived around 115 million years ago in the Khorat Basin. The climate would have been sub-tropical or tropical and semi-humid.\n\n\u2018It lived by hunting the plant-eating dinosaurs such as iguanodontians. And yes, we do believe Siamraptor was an apex predator at that time.\u2019\n\nThe new species described in PLOS ONE sheds fresh light on the early evolution of carcharodontosaurians.\n\nThese large predatory dinosaurs were widespread and successful for more than 130 million years \u2013 until the asteroid strike that wiped them all out.\n\nPalaeontologist Dr Chokchaloemwong, of Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University, said they were important members of ecosystems on multiple continents.\n\nBut their fossil record is notably lacking \u2013 with no definitive ones from Southeast Asia during the early Cretaceous when Siamraptor lived.\n\nIt was confirmed as a previously unknown dinosaur after comparison with other known species.\n\nThe beast would have been a fast mover \u2013 running on its hind legs to catch prey just like T Rex.\n\nSiamraptor also had short, strong arms that ended with long claws. Its head ended in a long snout.\n\nT. rex would have been bigger \u2013 typically growing to around 39 feet (12 metres) in length.\n\nDr Chokchaloemwong said: \u201cPhysical and genetic analysis indicates Siamraptor is a basal member of the carcharodontosaurs.\n\n\u2018This means it represents a very early evolutionary split from the rest of the group.\n\n\u2018It is also the first definitive carcharodontosaur known from Southeast Asia.\n\n\u2018Combined with similarly-aged finds from Europe and Africa, it reveals this group of dinosaurs had already spread to three continents by the Early Cretaceous\u2019", "description": "Fearsome beast was related to the monstrous Tyrannosaurus rex.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89168619_1570713852.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
