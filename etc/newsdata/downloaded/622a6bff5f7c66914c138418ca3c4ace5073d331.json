REUTERS/Carlos Osorio\n\nAfter two days of profuse apologies, Trudeau has resumed making campaign announcements as polls show his Liberals trailing the opposition Conservatives of Andrew Scheer slightly ahead of the Oct. 21 election.\n\nTrudeau, accusing the Conservatives of planning major spending cuts, said he would make sure all Canadians had access to a family doctor and affordable medicine.\n\n\u201cNo one should go without the care they need because they don\u2019t have access to a family doctor. And no one should have to give up food and heat to be able to pay for healthcare,\u201d Trudeau told reporters in the southwestern Ontario city of Hamilton.\n\nCanada\u2019s universal healthcare system does not include universal coverage for prescription drugs, and primary care doctors are scarce in many areas.\n\nThe cost of the proposal would be about C$6 billion ($4.52 billion) over four years, and Ottawa would work with the 10 provinces and three northern territories to implement the changes, Trudeau said.\n\nThe healthcare pledge was his fourth major campaign announcement since last Friday, when he vowed to ban military-style assault weapons. On Sunday he pledged to eliminate some taxes and slash cellphone bills by a quarter.\n\nThe ruling Liberals were knocked off course by old photos of Trudeau in blackface that emerged last week. The images were at odds with his oft-stated position that he wants to improve the lot of minorities in Canada and prompted international ridicule.\n\nForeign Minister Chrystia Freeland, the most visible member in Trudeau\u2019s Cabinet, told Reuters on Friday that the prime minister had her full confidence. Other Cabinet members, legislators and candidates have also made it clear the Liberal Party is standing squarely behind its leader.\n\nBut Trudeau still faced more questions about the photos on Monday, five days after Time magazine released the first picture.\n\n\u201cI am continuing to be open with Canadians about the mistake I made ... I should have known better but didn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nTejinder Singh, who is of Indian descent, said the pictures will not change his vote. \u201cHe has been very good to us. I am not interested in the photos. We support him,\u201d Singh said in the town of Stoney Creek, east of Hamilton, earlier on Monday.\n\nConservative rival Scheer, speaking outside Toronto, pledged on Monday to allow a 30-year mortgage - up from 25 years - for first-time homebuyers and to review the mortgage stress test they must face when seeking to buy a home.\n\nOpinion polls initially showed a significant dip for the Liberals, according to pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research, but he said it was fleeting because voting intentions are already shifting back toward where they were before the picture emerged.\n\nConservatives would win 34.3% of the national vote and the Liberals 33.1%, a Nanos Research poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail newspaper released on Monday showed.\n\nLiberal insiders are somewhat optimistic, noting that relatively few voters are bringing up the topic. A pollster noted that the election is still a month away.\n\n\u201cThe blackface photos may be the campaign moment that prevents the Liberals from being re-elected. But the initial reaction and how voters are reacting so far suggests there\u2019s way too much campaign left to make that conclusion today,\u201d said David Coletto of the Abacus polling firm, which has Conservatives leading the Liberals by 2 percentage points nationally, the same margin as last week.\n\nMeanwhile Green Party leader Elizabeth May, during a campaign stop on Canada\u2019s east coast, urged voters to choose the Greens in order to prevent either major party from being able to form a government without the support of smaller blocs like hers.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d she said of the mainstream parties. \u201cWe will keep our promises.\u201d\n\n($1 = 1.3270 Canadian dollars)", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged on Monday to create a national prescription drug plan if re-elected, moving back on the offensive after blackface photos of him emerged last week and hurt his campaign.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433037627&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1Q2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
