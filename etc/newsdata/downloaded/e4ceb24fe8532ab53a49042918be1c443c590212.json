I truly felt like I was drowning in hatred for my body,' she added.\n\n'After having my son almost six years ago I just felt so different about my body after he was born.\n\n'I was self-conscious of the scars and the weight, but I didn't revert back to eating disorder mode - it didn't feel important.'\n\nHayley said she only expected to have one or two children, but in early 2017 she found out she was pregnant with twin girls.\n\nAnd after giving birth to Ruby and Ramona, now two, Hayley finally felt at peace with her body.\n\n'Once I had my twin girls, I really felt even freer because I had realized what makes me truly happy and content in life is being grateful for the health and happiness of my kids and husband Cody.'\n\nHayley is proud of her body and what it has achieved in bringing her children into the world.\n\nUp close: Hayley aims to portray body positivity and proudly showcase her loose skin, after years spent 'drowning in hatred' before having children\n\nWarrior: Hayley said she now sees her body as something to be in awe of, after she carried her twins, pictured, to 37-and-a-half weeks\n\nScars: While pregnant with her twins in 2017, pictured, Hayley began to document her changing body on social media to inspire other moms\n\nShe decided to start sharing pictures of her postpartum body, loose skin and all, on Instagram in November 2017 after having her girls.\n\nNow Hayley is 15 lbs heavier and she hopes to be an inspiration to other moms to show them that they are not defined by their imperfections and can be comfortable in their own skin.\n\nFulfilled: The busy mom wants to show how her body image is no longer the thing the cares most about as she enjoys life with her kids\n\n'Not only does my body look much different but it feels so different too,' she said.\n\n'I actually struggle with diastasis recti (abdominal separation) and an umbilical hernia which both make life a bit difficult.\n\n'Pelvic floor physical therapy is also something I try to advocate for, because it really helps women to heal after pregnancy and birth.\n\n'I am so proud of my body. I'm also frustrated by the limitations, but I am so amazed by everything my body has done to carry, birth and nurse my children.\n\n'I am a petite woman who carried twin girls until 37-and-a-half weeks: I feel like a warrior.\n\n'I got the idea to share my postpartum body back right after I had my twin girls. I felt like the more I shared my truth, the less shame I would feel - and it worked.'\n\nHayley shares her beautiful body positive pictures on Instagram and is often inundated with messages of love and support from other moms from all over the world.\n\nHappiness: Hayley realized that it was her kids and husband Cody, pictured, that made her truly happy - not her weight\n\nHealth: The office manager and photographer has added 15 lbs to her frame since her lowest point of struggling with an eating disorder pre-kids\n\nCommunity: Sharing snippets into life with her twins, pictured, and son, Hayley continues to attract an audience of moms online who relate to her openness about being a parent\n\nWorthy: The 32-year-old, pictured with her daughter Ruby, said she is sharing the realistic side of mom life to inspire the next generation of women\n\nSo far, she has amassed over 150,000 followers - many of them moms - from all over the world.\n\n'Oh my gosh my biggest hope is to be a positive inspiration for other moms. I don't want anyone else to feel alone. I want the stigmas to end, and for us to feel comfortable being in our skin wearing what we want and not hiding away,' Hayley said.\n\n'The reactions I receive on social media are almost all positive,' she continued.\n\n'Some women love what I share but don't feel comfortable doing so themselves, but I'm really trying to build a community for us and encourage the mainstream media to drop their notions on what makes a body worthy of love.\n\n'The most difficult part of this journey is that it isn't a straight path to a destination. It's not linear and there will be bumps and hurdles.\n\n'There are still some days that have me frowning at myself before I remember that my worth and beauty is not defined by my flaws or 'imperfections'.\n\n'You are worthy. You are beautiful. You have grown. It's so important to work on ourselves and how we both speak and think about our bodies - we need to do this for our children - the future,' she concluded. e", "description": "A Missouri mom-of-three, 32, saw her weight plummet to just 89 lbs, left, before welcoming her children.
