It's so-what culture. I f***** you over? So what?\n\n'I'm going to run away with your money anyway. Trump is reflective of that culture. I mean, he was elected.\n\n'It's no coincidence that it is all happening at this late stage of our climate crises.\n\n'People at the forefront of fighting climate change are so lovely.
