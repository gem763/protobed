The way he has improved himself since coming in as a 16-year-old has been phenomenal,' Allen said.\n\n'He has always had that ability to score goals and he has improved his all-round game.\n\n'The way he conducts himself now, he has been incredible with how he has been this week.\n\n'If anyone can do it, Harry can and if he does I will be the first one to shake his hand.\n\nAllen is eager to keep his record, set in the 1986-87 season, but wished Kane good luck\n\n'I would like to maintain that record, and it will be an incredible feat if anyone does it, so good luck to him. He has already threatened to do it a couple of times.'\n\nAllen scored 33 times in the league, with three hat-tricks, while also firing David Pleat's side to the FA Cup final and League Cup semi-final.\n\nHe opens up about that phenomenal season in his autobiography Up Front and reveals how excelling at Spurs was his destiny.\n\nKANE'S HIGHEST SCORING SEASONS 2017-18: 41 goals 2016-17: 35 goals 2014-15: 31 goals 2015-16: 28 goals 2018-19: 24 goals\n\n'I was born two weeks after they did the double and my dad (Les Allen) was in that side,' he added.\n\n'It was always my destiny to one day play for Tottenham, which obviously happened.\n\n'I had the best years of my career there.\n\n'It has been such a big part of my life, listening to my dad talk about the double, right the way through to the last day at White Hart Lane, it has had a big impact.\n\n'You dream about breaking the record and hope that something like that could happen, but I never imagined it would.'\n\nAllen, who was famously sold by Arsenal 63 days after they paid \u00a31.25million for him, can take a small piece of credit for helping cement Spurs' position among the elite of English football.\n\nHe was part of the coaching set-up between 2004 and 2013, working under Martin Jol, Juande Ramos and Harry Redknapp, as the north Londoners established themselves as Premier League top six regulars.\n\n'The club has moved forward in a massive way,' Allen said. 'Having been involved in it to a small degree, having a part in it. It is nice to know that I played sort of a part.'\n\nAllen believes Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino won't be sacked despite recent struggles\n\nThat progression led them to the Champions League final last season, but they have endured a tough start to the current campaign.\n\nA horror 10 days, where they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Colchester, hammered 7-2 by Bayern Munich and humbled 3-0 at Brighton, has led to uncertainty over the position of boss Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nThere have been calls to sack the Argentinian, but Allen, who knows chairman Daniel Levy well, knows that is not going to happen.\n\n'I don't think he will get sacked, when you look at the way he has worked and the way he has developed the squad in terms of Champions League qualification, being competitive at the top end of the Premier League,' Allen said.\n\n'Daniel has delivered in a big way in terms of everything that is in place now, the best stadium in the world and the training complex, his relationship with the manager is a good one.\n\n'That has shown, Mauricio has been there five years and I don't see that changing any time soon.'\n\nUp Front by Clive Allen with James Olley is published on October 17 by deCoubertin Books and available from all good bookshops.
