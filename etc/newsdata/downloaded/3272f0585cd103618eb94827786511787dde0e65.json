They are one of the few that are in a position to make a significant run at this.\u201d\n\nNewsom made the remarks following a media briefing in Napa County, just east of a wildfire that has burned more than 25,000 acres, destroyed at least 49 structures and triggered a historic evacuation of tens of thousands of people. PG&E disclosed earlier this week that one of its transmission lines went down minutes before the blaze broke out.\n\nThe company\u2019s equipment has already been tied to a series of deadly blazes that devastated California in 2017 and 2018, saddling it with an estimated $30 billion in liabilities and forcing it into bankruptcy.\n\nBerkshire has been raised as a possible suitor since PG&E\u2019s collapse, but the most vocal group seeking to take control of the utility is a collection of creditors led by Pacific Investment Management Co. and activist investor Elliott Management Corp. Newsom said Saturday that he\u2019d like to see more than just hedge funds vying for the company and has been talking to mayors of cities including San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland about possible bids.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy Co. didn\u2019t immediately respond to telephone and emailed requests for comment left outside of business hours.\n\nNewsom didn\u2019t say whether he has discussed a bid with Berkshire. \u201cWe\u2019re having a lot of conversations with a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope is that those that are interested really step up those efforts because we are running out of time.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.net;Michael B.
