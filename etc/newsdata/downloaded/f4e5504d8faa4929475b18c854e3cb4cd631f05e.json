Polak hit his shoulder and neck simultaneously and went down immediately. He had to be stretchered off and was down on the ice for several minutes without moving.\n\nBruins forward Chris Wagner was the player involved in puck race with Polak. Wagner himself slipped into the boards on the play, but he veered off to the side after losing his balance and went in feet-first while Polak went in with his head and shoulder lowered. After the game, he called Polak's injury \"unfortunate\" but didn't see Polak hit the boards.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\"I didn't really see him go down,\" said Wagner, per Kevin Paul Dupont of The Boston Globe. \"I saw him, and it looked like he was going to give me a push, so I kind of went the other way and got out of it. Unfortunate . . . I didn't see him [hit] the boards. Sad.\"\n\nWhile Polak's injury was certainly scary, Stars head coach Jim Montgomery did provide a positive update on him during his postgame press conference.\n\n\"The good news is Roman has full use of his extremities and we feel he's pretty good at the hospital,\" Montgomery said, per Sean Shapiro of The Athletic. \"But we don't have results yet. We're hopeful he may be a player in a couple of days.\"\n\nRegardless of when Polak returns, it's just a good thing to hear that he has full use of his extremities. Hopefully, he'll be fully healthy soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
