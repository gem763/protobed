TV channel Teleamazonas showed images of its own offices in flames and said its employees were unharmed.\n\nIn a televised message to the South American country of 17 million people, Moreno thanked indigenous leaders for agreeing to talks but did not comment on whether he would repeal the law.\n\nMoreno also ordered a military-backed curfew in Quito and surrounding valleys starting at 3 p.m. (2000 GMT), blaming the violence on extremists whom he said had infiltrated protests.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to restore order in all of Ecuador,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting with the curfew in Quito.\u201d\n\nBut the announcement of the curfew came within half an hour of its implementation, giving anti-austerity protesters, many of whom had travelled to the city from the provinces, little time to head home.\n\nConaie, an umbrella organization for indigenous people in Ecuador, made the announcement about the talks with Moreno.\n\nEcuador\u2019s ombudsman Freddy Carrion, who has been monitoring the conflict and encouraging dialogue, said Conaie\u2019s leaders were unaware that Moreno planned to announce a curfew and said it could jeopardize talks.\n\n\u201cThis measure looks like a desperate attempt by the government that will only worsen the violence,\u201d said Carrion. He recommended Moreno suspend the subsidy cut immediately.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to reduce violence\u201d on both sides, Carrion said.\n\nConaie\u2019s leaders could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesman for a group that belongs to Conaie said its members were in an assembly and declined to provide immediate comment.\n\nPUBLIC TALKS PROPOSED\n\nEarlier on Saturday, one of Conaie\u2019s leaders told TV channel Ecuavisa that conditions for the talks included them being in public and having them broadcast.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk behind closed doors. It has to be with the Ecuadorean people,\u201d Leonidas Iza said in broadcast comments. \u201cThere has to be large screens so every tiny input from our members can be heard.\u201d\n\nA demonstrator takes cover during a protest against Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno's austerity measures in Quito, Ecuador October 12, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nThe mayor of Quito, Jorge Yunda, told Ecuavisa that Moreno\u2019s government had decided to \u201canalyse\u201d the decree Moreno passed last week that cut the longstanding fuel subsidies.\n\nMoreno, 66, had previously refused to repeal the law, defending it as a part of his efforts to rein in the fiscal deficit after signing a $4.2 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe government did not immediately respond to requests for comment about whether he was open to repealing or revising the law. It released a video on Twitter in which Moreno is heard describing a country that regains peace and prosperity.\n\nBefore the curfew was imposed, downtown Quito resembled a war zone as plumes of tear gas clouded streets littered with bricks. Small fires burned and groups of people huddled behind walls and makeshift barricades for protection.\n\nEcuadorean TV showed images of the comptroller\u2019s office enveloped in smoke. Thirty people were arrested at the multiple-story building, police said.\n\nFive people have been killed in the unrest since it began on Oct. 3, according to Carrion\u2019s office. More than a 1,100 people have been arrested and nearly 1,000 wounded, it said.\n\nSome oil wells have been closed by protesters, curbing production of more than 1 million barrels of crude so far, the energy ministry said. A Chinese-owned copper mine also announced on Saturday that it was limiting its operations as a precautionary measure.
