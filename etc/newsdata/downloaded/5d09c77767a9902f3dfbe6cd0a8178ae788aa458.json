And it doesn\u2019t mean that we can declare mission accomplished and just walk away. What we\u2019ve seen time and time again in this part of the world is that when the pressure is relieved on terrorist organizations, whether al-Qaeda or ISIS, they are able to reconstitute. So we need to be vigilant. We need to maintain a minimal presence in order to ensure that the pressure stays on ISIS and they don\u2019t come back roaring.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Was President Obama informed of the death of al-Baghdadi by the administration? Did you know before the news today?\n\nRICE: No, there\u2019s no reason why I should know. There is a tradition of common courtesy of presidents informing their predecessors of things of significance like this. Since the White House seemingly didn\u2019t feel it necessary to inform the leadership of the intelligence committees on a bipartisan basis, I\u2019m quite confident that they didn\u2019t do the normal protocol with respect to predecessors either.", "description": "Susan Rice said she was \"confident\" that Trump did not follow the \"normal protocol\" of informing Obama about al-Baghdadi's killing.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-614601896-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
