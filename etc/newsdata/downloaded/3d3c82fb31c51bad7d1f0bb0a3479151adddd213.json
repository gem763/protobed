In a worst-case scenario, just over 3,000 lorries a day, or 80% of lorries carrying loads, may need to be diverted because they do not have the right documents.\n\nThose without the right documents will be diverted to Ashford in Kent for up to 24 hours while they seek appropriate documents. If truckers then try to proceed to the Channel ports without the right documents, the drivers will be subject to a 300-pound fine.\n\n\"Despite the government\u2019s actions, it has been unable to mitigate the most significant risks to the effective functioning of the UK border in the event of no deal and the border would be 'less than optimal,\u2019\" the audit office said.\n\n\"It is likely that organised criminals and others would quickly exploit any perceived weaknesses, gaps or inconsistencies in the enforcement regime,\" it added.\n\n(Editing by Stephen Addison)", "description": "The United Kingdom's border risks being snarled up in a no-deal Brexit because as few as 30 percent of traders are prepared, the European Union would introduce controls and organised crime groups would exploit weaknesses, the National Audit Office said.
