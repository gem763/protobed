Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.\n\nShares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\nNo assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.\n\nClosed-End Fund Risk. The Fund is a closed-end investment company designed primarily for long-term investors and not as a trading vehicle. No assurance can be given that a shareholder will be able to sell his or her shares on the NYSE when he or she chooses to do so, and no assurance can be given as to the price at which any such sale may be effected.\n\nCredit Risk. Investments rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as high-yield, high risk or \"junk debt.\" They are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company's continuing ability to meet principal and/or interest payments. Non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the asset experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in NAV of the Fund.\n\nStory continues", "description": "DALLAS, Sept. 3, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0NexPoint Strategic Opportunities Fund (NHF) (\"NHF\" or the \"Fund\") today announced its regular monthly dividend on its common stock of\u00a0$0.20\u00a0per share.
