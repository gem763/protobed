About one in 500 have two.\n\nScientists are unsure of its purpose but Harvard University researchers have claimed the rubbing of tusks together by two narwhals is used to communicate information about the water each has travelled through.\n\nUnlike human teeth, whose sensitive parts are protected by enamel, the narwhal\u2019s coiled tooth is designed to get seawater in contact with nerve endings.\n\nNarwhals live in the Arctic ocean and are a cousin of the Beluga whale (Picture: Gazprom Neft/east2west news)\n\nThe purpose of the narwhal\u2019s horn is still uncertain (Picture: Gazprom Neft/east2west news)\n\nThe salinity of the water is believed to tell the animal whether nearby ice is melting or forming, indicating the risk of becoming trapped by ice.\n\nNarwhals live year-round in the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada and Russia.\n\nThey were dubbed \u2018unicorns of the sea\u2019 after medieval Europeans mistook their horns to be from the legendary unicorn, trading them for many times their weight in gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe length of the horn was not disclosed, though they can grow up to 10 feet long.\n\nThe latest find is currently being analysed by scientists and will later be displayed at the Arctic National Park museum in Arkhangelsk.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
