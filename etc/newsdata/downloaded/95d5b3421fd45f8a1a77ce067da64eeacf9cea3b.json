For me, that's because they have a wide selection, carry most of the brands I want, list them at near the lowest or the lowest prices I've seen in price comparison research (with shipping in mind), and, last but absolutely not least, because I'm a Prime member and the internet has made me a glutton for instant gratification \u2014 something that two-day (or two-hour) shipping panders well to.\n\nSome of the greatest advantages of shopping on Amazon are the wide selections and low costs, but those same features can work against you. It's time-consuming and ultimately expensive to root out what's really worth spending your money on, and which affordable options are similar (or better) in performance to their higher-priced competitors. The loophole is having trusted recommendations to help you navigate online.\n\nMy favorite way to make sense of what's great on Amazon is by getting recommendations from friends. As a result, I decided to ask my colleagues at Business Insider about the best things they've bought on Amazon for under $25 \u2014 in the hopes of finding some new things to try without wasting time or money discovering them. Hopefully, they're as helpful to you as they were to me.\n\nBelow are the 35 best things we've bought on Amazon that cost us less than $25:", "description": "I asked my Business Insider colleagues to share the best things they ever bought for under $25 on Amazon.", "authors": ["Mara Leighton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5aa6f2d73be59f23008b458c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
