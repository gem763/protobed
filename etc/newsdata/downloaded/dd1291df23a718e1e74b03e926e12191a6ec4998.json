Before that moment, Roman felt like he had the wind at his back, having not royally fucked up like his brother Kendall and perhaps winning his father\u2019s favor by suggesting the right path on axing Vaulter. By his calculation, he had moved into pole position in the Succession Grand Prix, which didn\u2019t seem like much of a race with Ken having crashed and burned, Shiv seemingly more interested in politics, and Connor bidding for Napoleon\u2019s mummified johnson. His father\u2019s assessment cut so deep to the bone that he slipped off to a management training program in a half-assed attempt to prove his seriousness.\n\nThe second slap in \u201cArgestes\u201d is literal, hard enough to knock out a tooth. It\u2019s difficult to say which of the two slaps hurt the most \u2014 the first is more existentially wounding, the second \u2026 well \u2026 knocks out a tooth \u2014 but it\u2019s enough to refocus the show on the Roy family dynamic and the various cycles of abuse that run through it, starting at the top. Kieran Culkin\u2019s reaction to his father calling him a \u201cmoron\u201d is one of the most indelible shots of the season, as the sibling most defined by give-a-shit swagger is laid low like a child. But tonight\u2019s slap is striking most by how quickly and emphatically Kendall reacts: \u201cNo! Don\u2019t fucking touch him!\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, this is the same Kendall who\u2019s spent the entire season numbly acquiescing to his father\u2019s needs and demands. He was the tip of the spear in gutting his precious Vaulter against his own advice, and he was instrumental in making the Pierce deal possible by turning an influential \u201cno\u201d into a \u201cyes.\u201d It\u2019s no mistake that this episode opens with Kendall browbeating the Waystar negotiators on Logan\u2019s behalf, echoing his father\u2019s caterwauling by using the word \u201cfucking\u201d as a modifier eight times in as many sentences. For this same man to defend his brother so instinctually is stunning to witness, especially after Roman had taken such rhetorical delight over Kendall\u2019s misfortune. The Roy children have been in this trench together their entire lives. They share a common enemy in Logan, and they\u2019re willing to set aside their internecine conflicts to come to one another\u2019s defense. For Kendall, a season of dead-eyed sycophancy ended in a split second.\n\nSet against the backdrop of a corporate getaway where the one-percent-of-the-one-percent gather together for panels, nature hikes, and $75 Cobb salads, \u201cArgestes\u201d deals with the fallout from a New York magazine piece on sexual misconduct on the Waystar cruise line. The types of conversations that happen before and after the article drops seem chillingly plausible. Executives have known about these problems for a long time\u2014the chief perpetrator, the late \u201cMo\u201d Lester, earned that nickname from them\u2014but they\u2019ve chosen to keep the truth buried in NDAs that have sat in the vault, threatening to detonate at any time. When the media finally catches on, the discussion continues to be about the company\u2019s survival, not a long-overdue culture change or shift to accountability.\n\nWhen word of the imminent article on cruises circulates, the first conversation is about how to keep the piece from coming out at all. This again sets the Roy children against each other in lobbying for their father\u2019s approval: Kendall thinks the magazine should be threatened with coffer-draining litigation if they decide to publish it, while Shiv wants to take the more conciliatory approach of agreeing to work with the author, which might delay the piece until Waystar can close the deal on Pierce. The second approach would involve conceding some wrongdoing within the company, thus making it a difficult sell to Logan, who takes any criticism of Waystar as persecution. He hails from the Trump school of never apologizing for anything.\n\nWhat\u2019s really telling about the entire affair is how the arguments shift after the article drops and the Roys are scrambling to do damage control. Suddenly, it\u2019s Kendall who argues for full accountability in the form of an internal investigation and a dramatic culture change, and Shiv who wants to hunker down for a few days and let the storm pass. The fact that dancers on the cruise line were asked for sex to secure contract renewals\u2014and that one may have drowned\u2014is never considered seriously by anyone at any point, because keeping the business moving forward and securing the Pierce deal are more important. It\u2019s easy to imagine similar discussions at Fox News, say, after the allegations against Bill O\u2019Reilly or Roger Ailes: There\u2019s no question their behavior was well-known internally, but it comes down to a dollars-and-cents assessment of lost advertisers and shareholder value, not a concern for victimized women. (That\u2019s how you get headlines touting the appointment of Fox News\u2019 first female CEO, Suzanne Scott, without having to change a culture she was allegedly complicit in enforcing.)\n\nIn the end, the cruises revelations are enough to send Nan Pierce literally running away from the deal while blaming Rhea and Logan for conspiring to steal the company out from under her. (The hiring of a stand-up comedian for the Argestes awards ceremony is a final twist of the knife: \u201cAhoy, there! Permission to never fucking board?\u201d) The whole affair leaves Logan in an even weaker position against the takeover bid than he had before, with the prospect of continued fallout and lasting damage to a profitable part of the company. And his kids are ready to go in for the kill: Shiv speaks at a panel about the \u201cdinosaur values\u201d that can limit a company in need of fresh eyes, and it\u2019s Roman\u2019s giggling over his father\u2019s live roasting that earns him a slap. But when the sun rises again, the entire Roy family will still be on this dysfunctional cruise ship together, captained by a man with both hands firmly grasped to the wheel. He won\u2019t see the iceberg coming.\n\nSad Sack Wasp Traps\n\n\u2022 For some reason, I hadn\u2019t paused to look at the ATN chyrons in the opening credits before, and they\u2019re suitably hilarious: \u201cGender Fluid Illegals May Be Entering The Country Twice\u201d is the top story, but the scroll has \u201cIs \u2018Sweetcheeks\u2019 Hate Speech Now?\u201d, which is even funnier.\n\n\u2022 Tom and Greg\u2019s banter over ATN\u2019s new market-tested slogan is priceless. \u201cWe\u2019re Listening\u201d doesn\u2019t work because the set-top boxes are, in fact, surveilling the people who use them. \u201cWe Hear You\u201d isn\u2019t much better, according to Greg, who likens the slim distinction to \u201cCouldn\u2019t help glimpse you changing\u201d rather than \u201cWe put a spy cam in your shower.\u201d The compromise version, \u201cWe Here For You,\u201d is double-meaning gobbledygook at its most sublime. Or as Greg puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s good because it\u2019s not clear what the hell it means, so there\u2019s lots of wiggle room.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Tom with maybe the line of the night: \u201cYou don\u2019t hear much about syphilis these days. Very much the MySpace of STDs.\u201d\n\n\u2022No one pounces on the Roys\u2019 misfortunes more effectively than Stewy, who scoffs at Kendall\u2019s threat of a deal that will make Waystar too big to buy (\u201cThis is a $75 Cobb salad. Dude you should buy that, use that as a defense.\u201d), reacts to the news (\u201cI guess if you did have something going on like deal-wise, it\u2019s like dead in the water now, like some of the women who went on those cruises\u201d), and extends the comedian\u2019s bit about likening the company to the Hindenberg (\u201cAt least nobody was forced to give a blowjob on the Hindenberg.\u201d).\n\n\u2022 \u201cRock Star and the Mole Woman\u201d is the belated superhero team-up of the summer. Look beyond Roman\u2019s withering assessment of Gerri as \u201ca competent kind of clever filing cabinet that everyone seems content to have around\u201d and a team-up between the two of them makes a certain amount of sense. The fact is, none of the Roy children have any business running the company, so for Roman, the \u201cJagger Tarzan\u201d with the little dick, tethering himself to a competent executive like Gerri presents the possibility for a more stable core at the top.\n\n\u2022 Roman, illiterate: \u201cIs this one of those things I need a woman to explain to me why it\u2019s bad?\u201d Shiv: \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I\u2019m not your grope Geiger counter.\u201d", "description": "Amid panels, nature hikes, and $75 Cobb salads, a new threat to the family\u2019s survival emerges.
