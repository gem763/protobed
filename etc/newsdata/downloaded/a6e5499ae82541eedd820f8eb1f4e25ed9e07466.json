(AP) - A fire at a fuel storage facility in the San Francisco Bay Area prompted a hazardous materials emergency Tuesday afternoon that led authorities to order about 12,000 people in two communities to stay inside with all windows and doors closed.\n\nEmergency sirens blared and thick plumes of black smoke and flames filled the skyline around the NuStar Energy LP facility in Crockett, California, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of downtown San Francisco.\n\nVideo footage of the fire showed flames leading up to an explosion so strong it blew the lid of one of the tanks high into the air.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dynamic, rapidly evolving situation,\u201d Capt. George Laing of the Contra Costa Fire Department said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two tanks that are releasing chemicals that are still burning.\u201d\n\nThe fire was finally contained at about 9 p.m., fire officials said, adding that county environmental health teams would be working to \u201cassess the current health threat.\u201d\n\nThe primary concern to the public was unhealthy air quality caused by hazardous particulates spewing from the fire.\n\nThe tanks were part of a cluster of fuel storage facilities along an industrial span next to the Carquinez Strait, a major shipping thoroughfare and a key oil hub.\n\nThe NuStar facility is also close to Interstate 80, one of the busiest highways in the San Francisco Bay Area, which officials shut down Tuesday afternoon, causing massive backups at the height of evening rush hour. The freeway finally reopened Tuesday night.\n\nContra Costa Fire Department spokesman Steve Hill said the two burning tanks contained about 250,000 gallons of ethanol, a gasoline additive, and firefighters tried to keep the blaze from spreading to other tanks storing jet fuel. At an evening news conference Hill corrected an earlier report in which he had said three tanks caught fire.\n\nEthanol typically produces a blue flame, leading firefighters to assume the fuel in the tanks may be mixed with another fuel.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing behind you is obviously not a blue flame, it\u2019s a black flame,\u201d Laing told KPIX-TV. \u201cSo it could be mixed material, it could be mixed fluids from multiple tanks. There could be manifolds, valves and pipes down there. At this point, it\u2019s still actively involved in fire so I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the number one thing they are finding out right now.\u201d\n\nAbout 200 firefighters battled the blaze, Hill said.\n\nCrews used water to cool tanks adjacent to the ones already burning to prevent the fire\u2019s spread, said firefighting expert Marcelo D\u2019Amico of Texas-based Orcus Fire and Risk. At the same time, foam was sprayed from fire trucks and delivered via a fixed system installed at the facility to help douse the flames, he said.\n\nEthanol fires are not necessarily any more difficult to fight than blazes burning gasoline or diesel, according to D\u2019Amico.\n\nA resident of Rodeo, Gabriel Iturbe, sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic as he tried to get home to his teenage son, who was home sick when he called his father to report a loud explosion.\n\n\u201cIt literally rocked the house and then soon after, he heard what sounded like a jet plane,\u201d Iturbe said, speaking from his cellphone in the car as he looked at \u201cthick, black smoke.\u201d He said he was trying to reach his son and take him out to a less smoky location.\n\nIn a statement at the height of the blaze, NuStar Energy said it was cooling nearby tanks to minimize the spread of fire but provided few other details. The company is a fuel storage and pipeline operator based in San Antonio.\n\nThe Contra Costa Health Department posted on Twitter that there was a \u201chazardous materials emergency\u201d in the towns of Crockett, home to about 3,100 people, and Rodeo, population 8,700. The department urged residents to stay inside and close all windows and doors.\n\n\u201cCover any cracks around doors or windows with tape or damp towels. Stay off the phone unless you need to report a life-threatening emergency at your location,\u201d the department said.\n\nOfficials said they did not immediately know the cause of the fire and whether there was any connection to a 4.5-magnitude earthquake Monday night centered in the East Bay city of Pleasant Hill, north of Oakland.\n\nThat quake caused malfunctions at two nearby oil refineries operated by Shell and Marathon oil, Randy Sawyer, Contra Costa County\u2019s chief environmental health and hazardous materials officer, told KQED News. Some equipment at the Shell refinery was temporarily affected by the quake, spokesman Ray Fisher said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A fire at a fuel storage facility in the San Francisco Bay Area prompted a hazardous materials emergency Tuesday afternoon that led authorities to order about 12,000 people in two communities to stay inside with all windows and doors closed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/oil_storage_fire_27446_c0-124-3000-1874_s1200x700.jpg?6f06f4aee5bb8338517b1376bdd55b0df3bd0bc5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
