Roberts Jr. in dismissing President Trump\u2019s suggestion there are \u201cTrump judges\u201d and \u201cObama judges\u201d whose decisions are predictable based on who appointed them.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean all is well in the legal world, where he does acknowledge a gap between what judges are supposed to be doing \u2014 deciding cases based on the laws written by Congress \u2014 and the expectations of many Americans, who want judges to shape outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the law, you go across the street. You change it. It\u2019s not my job to do their job,\u201d he told The Washington Times from his Supreme Court chambers, on the other side of First Street from the U.S. Capitol. \u201cWe need to understand the separation of powers \u2026 To me it\u2019s what keeps us free.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment pervades his book \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It,\u201d which is being released Tuesday. The title is taken from a famous line Benjamin Franklin is said to have told an enthusiastic questioner about the outcome of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787.\n\nCount him among those still convinced the founders got it right, though he is concerned that Americans don\u2019t fully appreciate the genius of the system they set up. Sometimes, he argues in his book, neither do towering legal minds.\n\nHe takes on those who say the courts should shape social outcomes the way they see fit \u2014 a philosophy sometimes propounded by, among others, retired Judge Richard Posner, who likes to rule without regard to \u201cdoctrine, precedent and all that stuff.\u201d\n\nAnd Justice Gorsuch fiercely defends the legislative gridlock that irks so many others who look at Washington and wonder why things aren\u2019t getting done.\n\n\u201cLawmaking\u2019s supposed to be hard, because it\u2019s restricting your liberty, right?\u201d he said in his interview with The Times. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a public process by your elected representatives, by representatives elected by different constituencies at different times, by two bodies. You\u2019ve got to go to different bodies.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get the president on board or override his veto. Modern social science has proven this essentially creates a supermajority requirement, by itself. And it gives minorities a very special power in the process because their votes, which might otherwise not count much in a pure democracy, now because of this convoluted and difficult system, they have a voice,\u201d he said. \u201cMadison knew this. This is the genius of the design.\u201d\n\nJustice Gorsuch\u2019s book is a compilation of works \u2014 speeches he\u2019s delivered, such as a memorial to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat he filled on the high court; essays he\u2019d written for symposiums; and original pieces summarizing his approach.\n\nHe also includes some of his opinions as a judge, where he\u2019s grappled with big constitutional issues.\n\nOne of his major themes is a defense of judging, arguing that those who view judges as political actors working to shape outcomes not only misread their role \u2014 but are wrong about the realities.\n\nHe goes through the math, pointing to some 360,000 cases filed each year in federal courts. Of those, 5.6% actually get appealed to a circuit court, and 95% of those will be resolved unanimously. The Supreme Court will end up hearing about 70 cases a year \u2014 in theory the toughest of the toughies \u2014 and 40% of the time the justices will still issue a unanimous ruling.\n\nHe said that ratio has been steady for decades, suggesting the courts are still operating as they should.\n\n\u201cGet nine people to agree with where to go to lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe managed to reach unanimity in those hardest cases about 40 percent of the time.\u201d\n\nChief Justice Roberts last year issued a rebuke of Mr. Trump amid the president\u2019s criticism of some of the rulings against him \u2014 often by judges appointed by Presidents Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d the chief justice said in his extraordinary statement. \u201cWhat we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d\n\nYet the numbers suggest there is something to Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint.\n\nA Washington Times analysis of Obamacare decisions earlier this decade found a clear division between rulings from judges nominated by Democratic presidents and those from GOP-appointed judges.\n\nLikewise a Times analysis over the last two years found near unanimity among Democratic-appointed judges in ruling against Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration actions. GOP-appointed judges were far more mixed in their rulings.\n\nJustice Gorsuch dismissed the notion outcomes could be predicted with some success based on the party of the president who nominated a judge, saying he himself changes his mind on cases at every step of the way, from reading briefs to hearing oral arguments to talking with his colleagues to sitting down to write.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we fallible? Of course we\u2019re fallible. We\u2019re not perfect. We all have a professional identity that we aspire to. This is what the good judge aspires to. That\u2019s what I see on a day in and a day out basis this court and courts across this country.\n\n\u201cMostly these are anonymous judges. These are people that gave up lucrative private practices because they believe in the Constitution, they love this country, they believe it\u2019s a beacon for hope, they believe the Constitution is the greatest charter of human liberty ever devised, and they\u2019d rather spend their life in defense of that than in chasing another dollar,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is a strong proponent of the originalist approach to judging, which means looking to what those who wrote the laws meant at the time they passed them.\n\n\u201cAn originalist isn\u2019t horse-and-buggy days. He\u2019s taking an idea from the Founding and extrapolating to current conditions. The meaning doesn\u2019t change, the applications might,\u201d the justice said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
