Until now, three elements central to Warren\u2019s candidacy have received relatively little pressure from her opponents as she has slowly ticked up in the polls.\n\nThe first is whether the candidate of always having a plan can escape the question of Medicare for All\u2019s cost that has haunted her candidacy for months. The second is the corollary character question about whether her refusal to cough up more details and numbers will damage Warren\u2019s robust approval ratings. Finally, Warren has made strides to convince Democrats that she can beat Trump, but until Tuesday she hasn\u2019t had to answer sustained attacks that her platform is too far left to win.\n\nShe seemed to hold up relatively well \u2014 no major slip-ups \u2014 but the arguments her rivals made against her are a harbinger of what\u2019s to come this fall, after a relatively smooth ascent over the past several months.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/1a/24/c2759c964961ba638ee9d87ffee6/elizabethwarren.png\"\n\nWarren is often credited with running the most disciplined campaign, and she was clearly prepared for the evening\u2019s offensive. Indeed, her most persistent critic, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has raised as much money as Warren but has only a fifth of the vote share to show for it, has been signaling for weeks that he would aggressively challenge her in Ohio.\n\nThrough three hours of sporadic attacks, Warren remained energetic (some voters had to be surprised to learn midway through the evening that Warren is 70 years old), occasionally cutting (\u201cMedicare for all who can afford it,\u201d she called Buttigieg\u2019s plan), and unmoved by her interlocutors\u2019 insistence that she confess to the true costs of her health care plan. (A direct question \u2014 \u201cWill you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?\u201d \u2014 was answered with references to \u201cmy principles,\u201d the number of selfies she\u2019s taken this year and anecdotes about the indignities of the modern medical system, but neither a yes or a no.)\n\nThe evening\u2019s attacks began with the issue that has dominated all four Democratic primary debates \u2014 in fact, the issue that has dominated Democratic politics since FDR: how to achieve universal medical insurance in the United States.\n\nUnlike Bernie Sanders, the progenitor of the Warren policy, the Massachusetts senator has declined to explain how she would pay for her plan to transition all Americans into the popular Medicare program that now only serves people over 65. Her refusal to detail the costs was turned into cudgel by Buttigieg and others to question not just her policy but her honesty.\n\n\u201cWe heard it tonight,\u201d said Buttigieg when asked whether Warren was \u201cevasive.\u201d \u201cA yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\u201d\n\nWhen Sanders butted into the conversation, it was as a foil that Warren\u2019s attackers could use. \"I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\u201d said Sanders, one of the few candidates who declined to press Warren.\n\n\u201cWell, at least that's a straightforward answer,\u201d said Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cBernie is being honest,\" added Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \u201cWe owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.\u201d Warren responded by trying to explain that her life\u2019s work of studying \u201cwhy hard-working people go broke\u201d convinced her that only Medicare for All could address spiraling health costs that bankrupt Americans.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth's work,\" Klobuchar said wryly. \u201cBut, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nWhen the discussion turned to Warren\u2019s wealth tax, candidates seized on the same perceived vulnerabilities: She is too idealistic and too dismissive of other ways to achieve the same goal. Andrew Yang noted that a wealth tax had been tried and abandoned in Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden.\n\nKlobuchar seemed peeved that Warren was too rigid in her policy thinking. \u201cI want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire\u201d \u2014 Tom Steyer \u2014 \u201cwants to protect billionaires. We have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke leveled a new criticism. \u201cSometimes Sen. Warren is more about being punitive and pitting some part of the country against each other, instead of lifting people up,\u201d he said. (An incredulous Warren retorted, \u201cI'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive!\u201d)\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/738/1155968404_6095161841001_6095152425001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nMuch of the pile-on concerning health care was not really about the policy, but instead about Warren\u2019s character. This is a familiar script. In the fall of 2007, when Barack Obama was struggling to gain ground against Hillary Clinton, his advisers told him he would never win a white paper war against a policy wonk like Clinton, and he needed to turn the race to a contest about character. That is precisely what Obama did in October and November of that year, when he subtly raised issues about whether Clinton was honest. (Two of the architects of that strategy, Larry Grisolano and the Benenson Strategy Group, now work for Buttigieg.)\n\nThere are obvious differences between 2007 and 2019. Clinton\u2019s reputation had been battered during her husband\u2019s presidency, while Warren\u2019s favorability ratings are strong. But still, the strategy is familiar.\n\nThere were stretches Tuesday night when Biden, the co-front-runner, faded from the conversation as Klobuchar, Buttigieg, and O\u2019Rourke engaged Warren. But in the final hour the two leaders in the race had a clash that was akin to an after-credits scene of a superhero movie that sets up the next film. Biden bragged that he was the only one on stage who has accomplished major legislative achievements, a claim that arguably has some merit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Warren pointed to her work, before she was a senator, helping pass the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Biden was quick to add that he personally rounded up votes for the legislation.\n\n\u201cI convinced people to vote for it,\u201d he insisted.\n\nWarren refused to cede an inch of credit to him for her signature accomplishment.\n\n\u201cI am deeply grateful,\u201d she said slowly and with what may have been a smirk, \u201cto President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\u201d\n\nBiden grinned widely, seeming to almost admire her ploy.\n\nThey both had reason to grin. By the end of the night, things were back to where they started: with Biden and Warren on top. But after months of Biden receiving the scrutiny and criticism of a front-runner, it's now Warren being chased by a pack of much more aggressive rivals.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/60/9d/52da344f4209b7999ddccaca58b3/191016-warren-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
