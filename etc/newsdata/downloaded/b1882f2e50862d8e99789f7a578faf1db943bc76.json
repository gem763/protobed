The Redskins running back slightly pulled back, with his eyebrows scrunched together, before nodding in the affirmative that yes, he was excited about Bill Callahan\u2019s pledged commitment to the run.\n\nA small smile broke out in the corners of his mouth.\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m hyped about it,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cYou look at the first four weeks I played, it was like 11, 12, 10, seven carries. It was totally the opposite of what we did last year when we were more successful as a team.\u201d\n\nAs the Redskins prepare for the lowly Miami Dolphins on Sunday, they\u2019re doing so with a renewed emphasis on committing to the run. Through five winless games, the Redskins rank third-to-last in rushing attempts, much to the dismay of Callahan, Washington\u2019s new interim coach. The Redskins stopped running the ball because they trailed in games, but Callahan and others felt like it was abandoned too quickly.\n\nNow, facing a team giving up 175.8 rushing yards per game, the Redskins have a good opportunity to get back on track.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be exciting to see what (Callahan\u2018s) able to do with full control and kind of doing things the way he actually wants to do them when it comes to the play-calling and stuff like that,\u201d Peterson said. \u201c(if) the head coach says the run game is going to be a big emphasis, then that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be what it is.\u201d\n\nUnder Gruden, Callahan had control of the run game, but did not call plays. In the Redskins\u2019 new structure, offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell will be the one calling the plays, but Callahan has the authority to overrule or change the call upon hearing it.\n\nDetailing his philosophy to reporters, Callahan said he wants running backs to be able to establish a rhythm \u2014 something the Redskins haven\u2019t done this year.\n\nPeterson pointed to a play in the New England game that he felt like was a perfect example of not capitalizing on an opportunity. With 2:30 left in the first quarter on first-and-10, the Redskins ran a \u201c14 structure,\u201d or a mid-zone run, that resulted in a seven-yard gain.\n\nPeterson, though, got the look he wanted. He was stopped because linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower made a great play to force the Peterson back inside. But the hole was there If only the Redskins had just ran it again right away, Peterson thought, it could have popped off for an even larger gain.\n\nInstead, the Redskins took him out and didn\u2019t run the play again until later on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018God, I\u2019m in a rhythm and I\u2019m feeling it,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cAnd you kind of just simmer back down. \u2026 You\u2019re kind of just on the sidelines anxiously waiting to get back in there to get that look again.\n\n\u201cNow I know how Bill loves to run the ball, he might line it right back up and run it again.\u201d\n\nAnother reason Gruden was hesitant to run the ball was due to the lack of success when they ran it. After being Washington\u2019s leading rusher last year, Peterson is averaging just 2.7 yards per carry in 2019. As a team, Washington is averaging just 3.9 yards per attempt.\n\nCallahan, though, dismissed yards per attempt when speaking to reporters and said he\u2019s focused on two things: Rushing attempts and pass completions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the league statistics that we all look at is rush attempts and a lot of times, your rush attempts and completions if you have more than an opponent, really you\u2019re in good shape to win the football game,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high percentage \u2014 I think it\u2019s over 80 percent. \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s not always perfect; it\u2019s not always right. It\u2019s just an identity that I believe in.\u201d\n\nPeterson has bought in, and into Callahan\u2019s methods in general. On Thursday, he raved about Callahan\u2019s changes to practices, noting how they felt similar to the ones during his time in Minnesota and New Orleans. Beyond focusing on an increased pace, Callahan has implemented more 9-on-7 work, reps that are designed to boost the run game.\n\nPeterson, who pointedly noted after the loss to New England that something needed to change, said players have bought in.\n\n\u201cGuys are busting their butts,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThey\u2019re working hard. This has been the best week of practice since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
