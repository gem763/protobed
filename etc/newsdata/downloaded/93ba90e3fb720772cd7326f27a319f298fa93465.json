Roglic\u2019s teammate Tony Martin was forced to abandon the race following the incident.\n\nMathieu van der Poel pips Matteo Trentin to keep Tour of Britain lead Read more\n\n\u201cIf this is cycling and the UCI decides who is going to win, well perfect,\u201d said Movistar\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Luis Arrieta said. \u201cThis kind of thing has happened to us and they didn\u2019t take this decision.\u201d\n\nThe UCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCycling etiquette dictates that if a race leader suffers a crash or mechanical problem then the rest of the race waits for him to recover and rejoin the peloton. In this instance, immediately after Roglic hit the deck Movistar attacked, drawing fierce criticism from commentators and other members of the peloton. Team Ineos\u2019s Owain Doull told Eurosport: \u201cIt depends if they were riding out ahead beforehand \u2013 if they weren\u2019t then that was shocking. It\u2019s not like they did it for a few kilometres and then sat up, it was pretty divided for a while. If I were Roglic and Jumbo I wouldn\u2019t be happy. I\u2019m not happy and it had nothing to do with me.\u201d\n\nRoglic and L\u00f3pez were then led back to the main group by drafting in the slipstreams of team cars, which is not permitted under normal circumstances.\n\nArrieta claimed his team had always planned to attack following the short downhill stretch and that their positioning in the peloton was justification for their manoeuvre. \u201cWe were always going to attack where the crosswinds would come into play and we were at the head of the pack for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent hours and hours doing recons. Obviously I don\u2019t like crashes but we\u2019ve lost races because of crashes. I told them to stop only when the UCI said that they would allow riders to use the cars to catch up.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riders in action during the 19th stage.

He finished five seconds ahead of the chasing peloton, who caught the rest of the break with just over one kilometre of the cobbled uphill finish remaining.\n\nRoglic leads Valverde by 2min 47sec with Saturday\u2019s 190km mountain stage \u2013 containing five climbs \u2013 from Arenas de San Pedro to Plataforma de Gredos realistically the world champion\u2019s final chance to claw back time on the Slovenian.", "description": "Movistar\u2019s sporting director accused cycling\u2019s governing body of favouring leader Primoz Roglic after the Slovenian was allowed to use a car\u2019s slipstream to catch up with the peloton after a crash", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ccec5dba9f9b5c95a5cbc41bca4aa208af40a66/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c519de9780d7ee292188d9d04b92880", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
