Photo: Jordan Ashleigh\n\nBrian Bahe (@brian_bahe) is a stand-up comedian and writer originally from Phoenix, Arizona, but now based in New York City. He co-hosts the stand-up shows Butt Dream at the Rack Shack and Star Fuckers: Astrology But Make It Comedy at Union Hall.\n\nThis week, Brian and I talked about lingerie, gay sex, and having a tiny, tiny bladder.\n\n\u201cOmw! Train is delayed!\u201d\n\n-Me still very much in the womb, not yet born \u2014 Brain Bae (@brian_bahe) June 10, 2019\n\nI\u2019m late. I\u2019m late. I\u2019ve always been late. I\u2019m literally never on time. For me, being on time means I\u2019m only 15 minutes late. When I open a text message on my phone, the predictive text automatically fills in \u201ctrain is delayed.\u201d Being late in New York City is so relatable and thank you (not really a thank you), Mayor Bill de Blasio, for not fixing or addressing the MTA subway issues, which gives us late people the evergreen excuse of saying that our train is delayed.\n\nHas Twitter been a helpful platform for your comedy?\n\nTwitter is where I put some of my dumbest thoughts. I don\u2019t fully appreciate how useful those dumb thoughts actually are until like a month later when I\u2019m having a joke-writing dry spell and I\u2019m feverishly trying to find a new premise. During those times I\u2019ll scroll through my feed and find like three or four tweets that I like or that I see in a different light than when I tweeted them, and I\u2019m like, That could be something. Luckily the joke is already there in the tweet so it\u2019s just a matter of expanding that. This usually works one out of every ten times. But yeah, it mostly just helps me develop a lot premises and acting as an archive for them.\n\nWhat made you get into stand-up?\n\nI started doing improv when I was in college, and I entertained the thought of doing stand-up for years before fully committing to it when I moved to New York. I just wanted to be onstage as much as possible (yeah gross, I know). Improv is more set up for doing it a few times a week, whereas stand-up you can do from 4 p.m.\u20131 a.m. almost every day, and no one should ever do unless they truly have a vendetta against their mental health. Once I started doing it, I realized there were no Native American, gay, raised-Catholic voices in the game, which I found weird because we have so much representation in literally every other field. That made me stick with it.\n\nArriving 30 min late to a foursome is like going into a movie 30 min after it starts. I can still appreciate it for what it is but when someone says \u201cAdam\u201d I whisper to someone, \u201cwhich one\u2019s Adam???\u201d \u2014 Brain Bae (@brian_bahe) July 16, 2019\n\nThis one kinda builds upon the previous tweet by keeping the theme of lateness and also adds the element of gay sex, which is something that I refuse to not tweet about. My ancestors would have wanted it this way. Every time I tweet about gay sex, I just picture my ancestors looking over their glasses at me and being like, Bitch, how about you avenge our deaths first? But to live in New York City in 2019 means that you\u2019re engaging in gay sex on an hourly basis. Even the straightest of straight people have had gay sex at least twice today and it\u2019s only 10:44 a.m. But yeah, I totally had a foursome and I was late, and I 100 percent texted them \u201ctrain is delayed.\u201d\n\nSo you\u2019re Native American, gay, and were raised Catholic: a triple threat, frankly. Do those parts of your identity influence your comedy in any way?\n\nMy comedy is only about being Native American, gay, and raised Catholic. I try to do observational jokes here and there, but sometimes I\u2019m like, Why am I trying to write jokes about Cheetos when I have this identity that most audiences never really see or hear about? The downside is that, believe it or not, talking about only yourself every night does get old. So Cheetos jokes do have a place in my comedy, too. My comedy is literally only about being Native American, gay, raised Catholic, and loving Hot Cheetos.\n\nYou host a monthly stand-up show in a lingerie shop. What inspired that?\n\nI co-host that show Butt Dream (the first Sunday of every month at the Rack Shack) with my friend Julie Mitchell. She and I had been talking about starting a show for a while, but couldn\u2019t find a venue that we both liked. Julie lives near the the Rack Shack and wandered into an event that was there one night, and struck up a conversation with Laura the owner. Julie pitched her the idea and Laura was onboard. The show has been a literal dream. It\u2019s comedy near lingerie which almost makes the comedy sexy, which is a miracle if there ever was one.\n\nBeing Native American in New York City means that i can put my ear to the ground and immediately know where the nearest Starbucks bathroom with no line is \u2014 Brain Bae (@brian_bahe) April 10, 2019\n\nI pee about 10 to 15 times a day, which I\u2019ve heard is way too many times a day to pee, but that is my journey. For me, living in New York means constantly keeping an eye out for a bathroom that I can destroy with my weirdly tiny bladder. And as if that weren\u2019t enough, I\u2019m also a Native American so I\u2019m constantly just like, What are points of references that white people have for Native people that I can kind of play upon in the sphere of Twitter? Because a lot of y\u2019all (whypepo) don\u2019t know we\u2019re out here. And at least one of us has a tiny bladder.\n\nOkay, so prove it: Where is the closest Starbucks bathroom with no line and also minimum mess?\n\nAs a Brooklyn queen, the one at 325 Lafayette Ave. is *chef\u2019s kiss*.", "description": "An interview with New York-based comedian and writer Brian Bahe about writing funny tweets, gay sex, and running a comedy show in a lingerie shop.", "authors": ["Taylor Garron"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-brian-bahe.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
