We\u2019ll be sharing some of the many suggestions that have arrived.)\n\nHere\u2019s another in the series: making it easy to plant large numbers of trees, city-by-city.\n\nIn an article in the October issue of the magazine, I cite recent findings that tree-planting matters more than many people suspect, in its potential climate impacts. The story said:\n\nAfter Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, more than 400 U.S. mayors, representing most of the U.S. economy, said their communities would still adhere to it. \u201cThat is where most of the leverage lies on sustainability\u2014with mayors and governors,\u201d Morley Winograd told me. He gave the example of planting trees, which might sound insignificant but, according to a new study by researchers in Switzerland, could be a crucial step toward removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. \u201cThis could spread city by city, state by state, with no federal involvement or limitation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tree-planting movement has gained surprising momentum. For example, check out this report from Louisville, on its ambitious \u201cGreen Heart\u201d project to assess the impact of urban green space. Or this, from Tulsa, about the difference its \u201cUp With Trees\u201d program has made. Or the \u201cGreenprinting\u201d map tool, from the Trust for Public Land. Or the MTree tool.\n\nFor now, here\u2019s an illustration of one community taking an innovative step. This story has three bonus reactions for attracting my attention.\n\nFirst, the community in question is my original homeland, the small inland-California community of Redlands, in San Bernardino County.\n\nSecond, the tree-planting initiative is of a variety often mocked in the nation\u2019s capital but of growing importance at the community level: namely, a \u201cpublic-private partnership.\u201d It\u2019s a collaboration involving a private company (the mapping firm Esri); a local university (the University of Redlands); and the community\u2019s public schools (of which I am an alum).\n\nThird, the news is reported by a new local publication, the Redlands Community News, which fits the pattern I have reported on from Maine and Mississippi and Massachusetts, in offsetting the pernicious effect of private-equity control of local newspapers. (More reports are coming on this local-journalism theme, from Michigan and Tennessee and Massachusetts and beyond.)\n\nOne of our good friends in Redlands, Shelli Stockton of the University of Redlands, explains the idea. The reason for spelling this out is the possible application elsewhere:\n\nIdea: Increase the awareness of the benefits of trees through education and give away trees to plant. Redlands\u2019 specific project involves presentations at school assemblies, providing each elementary student in our city a tree to plant, and mapping and measuring the results with GIS [online maps, like those developed by Esri in Redlands]. The project will take place in April 2020 in honor of the 50th worldwide Earth Day celebration. Approximately 12,000 trees will be distributed. How It\u2019s Done: Identify key partners in the project, including a funder to pay for the trees, an audience with whom to communicate and distribute the trees, and a person(s) to organize the project. In our case the players are: Funder: a local company with an interest in the environment and climate change issues\n\nAudience: the local school district and private schools\n\nOrganizer: the local university How This Works Locally: Redlands has been named a Tree City USA Community by the Arbor Day Foundation for 22 years. It has a volunteer-led city Street Tree Committee who assist city staff in overseeing issues regarding the city\u2019s urban forest \u2026 There was even a project to plant trees in honor of a nine-year-old girl who died of leukemia. The University of Redlands is also 10 consecutive year Tree Campus USA school and has more than 4500 trees on its 160-acre campus.\n\nIt\u2019s medium-scale idea with potentially very large effects. And of course planting trees is only the first step: they need to be watered, tended, cared for. But it\u2019s an important start, which other communities could consider.
