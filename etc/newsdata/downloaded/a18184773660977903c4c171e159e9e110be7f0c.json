Just answer a few questions regarding model and condition and we\u2019ll provide an estimated trade-in value or a simple way to recycle it.\n\nIf you trade in online, we\u2019ll apply your estimated trade-in value to the purchase of your new iPhone. Then we\u2019ll arrange for you to send us your old iPhone. Once we receive it, we\u2019ll inspect it and verify its condition. If the condition matches what you described, there\u2019s nothing more you need to do. If the condition doesn\u2019t match, a new trade-in value will be provided.\n\nYou\u2019ll have the option to either accept this revised value or reject it. We\u2019ll work with you to confirm that you still want to move forward with the trade-in.\n\nIf you accept the trade-in estimate in the store, we\u2019ll give you instant credit toward your iPhone purchase.\n\nAnd if you choose to recycle your device, we\u2019ll either handle it in the store or provide a prepaid shipping label so you can send your device to our accredited recycling partner.", "description": "Buy iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus in Space Gray, Silver, or Gold today.
