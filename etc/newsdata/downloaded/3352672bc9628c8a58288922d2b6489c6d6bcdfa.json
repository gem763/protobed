'\n\nBetrayal: Coleen and Rebekah have been close friends for years - they were pictured together at the England vs Wales game in France\n\nTrauma: But Coleen has said she was being betrayed for years and it's obviously caused her considerable distress\n\nShock: Moreover, Wayne and Rebekah's footballer husband Jamie are also close friends and were pictured hugging one another at the same England vs Wales match\n\nSilence: Neither Wayne nor Jamie have commented on the claims made by Coleen - pictured together in 2016 - but it's claimed Wayne warned Jamie about Rebekah around that time\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while).\n\n'Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\nNothing to see here: The Sun have since removed their story about Wayne and Coleen's basement flooding after it transpired she had made it up - the page has been replaced with a melting ice cream picture\n\nFootballer's Wives: Netflix have even tweeted to say they are planning on turning this story into something major\n\nTaking sides: Fellow WAG Danielle Lloyd clearly made her feelings known when she started replying to Coleen's post with RAT emojis\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nShe also wrote: 'This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it......'\n\nClapping hands: People were telling Coleen to 'go girl' after her post was released\n\nRebekah hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations.\n\nShe wrote: 'Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even having to write this. I\u2019m pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I\u2019m now having to take legal advice as I can\u2019t deal with this stress myself when I\u2019m this pregnant. I\u2019m now having to take legal advice as I can\u2019t deal with this stress myself when I\u2019m this pregnant.'\n\nShe also shared: 'As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\nShocked: Within minutes of Coleen's post, the internet was awash with reactionary memes from fans who couldn't believe what they were seeing\n\n'I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n'If you thought this was happening you can could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'\n\nShe continued: 'Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n'I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n'I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n'I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened [broken heart emoji].'\n\nRebekah's spokesperson also told MailOnline: 'Please refer to Becky\u2019s social media posts.\n\n'It isn\u2019t true, she is now very upset and stressed so has passed it to her legal team to deal with. Such a shame that Coleen didn\u2019t just call her when she had her number.'\n\nBroken the internet: Coleen's rant has caused a stir among her fans\n\nIt was claimed back in 2016 that Wayne had 'warned' Jamie Vardy about Rebekah in England showdown talks in 2016.\n\nWayne and Jamie were both part of the England squad at Euro 2016 as the Three Lions were dumped out by Iceland.\n\nThe Times claimed Rooney told Vardy to make sure Rebekah didn't provide a distraction with her social media posts.\n\nShe had earlier hit out at French police for treating England fans 'like animals'.", "description": "Coleen Rooney has taken to social media to accuse her friend Rebekah Vardy of selling stories on her personal life.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19484102-0-image-a-13_1570614311311.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
