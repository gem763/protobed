Adam Schiff (D-CA) from the Democrats\u2019 \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d of President Donald Trump.\n\nMcCarthy explained Schiff should now be considered a \u201cfact witness\u201d in the broader investigation of these matters given his and his staff\u2019s role in coordinating with the whistleblower over the summer.\n\nMcCarthy said the pair of major revelations this week\u2014first that Schiff\u2019s staff met with the whistleblower before he or she reported concerns to the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG), and second that the whistleblower concealed the Schiff staff meeting from the ICIG, as the ICIG testified this week\u2014undercut Schiff\u2019s ability to move forward with the investigation. As such, McCarthy said, Schiff and his staff should now be considered \u201cfact witnesses\u201d in the investigation\u2014and Pelosi should formally sideline him, removing him from his chairmanship and having him recuse himself from an investigation it would be impossible for him to honestly oversee.\n\n\u201cSomething very, very interesting came out yesterday and they control what happens\u2014they\u2019ll leak just a couple texts instead of the full transcript,\u201d McCarthy said in an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend.\n\n\u201cIf the whole transcript was out there, you\u2019d ask why go on with this investigation? Yesterday, we had the ICIG, which is the Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, in for a hearing. What we found out was he testified that the whistleblower never told him that he had already met with Schiff\u2019s staff. Two things happen from that: It already goes to the political bias of the whistleblower. The whistleblower filling out the forms, there was a point there to put that in and [he] skipped it\u2014did not want them to know, Schiff\u2019s staff, that he had met with them yet. Nobody knows what was said with Schiff\u2019s staff. Nobody knows if he met with Schiff, what they talked about, no one knows how many times they met. No one knows any about this except Schiff and his staff. Now, having done that, they are what is called \u2018fact witnesses.\u2019 When you are a fact witness, you cannot be a head of an investigation and be a prosecutor. No one in our judicial system would ever allow that. Why? Because Schiff and his staff should now be called in as witnesses. We need to cross-examine them. What did they talk about? What did you tell them? You can\u2019t be in charge of the investigation too. This is such a hoax, every element of it, it goes against every basic fairness,\u201d said McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy added that the whistleblower\u2019s decision to conceal the Schiff meeting from the Inspector General\u2014and Schiff having lied about it to the public, which undercuts his credibility as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and as Pelosi\u2019s lead investigator\u2014casts a shadow of doubt over the Democrats\u2019 already-hyper-partisan impeachment effort. Schiff\u2019s broader history, McCarthy noted, is one filled with deceit and lies\u2014dating back to when he falsely claimed to have \u201cevidence\u201d of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, something Schiff did not have and does not have.\n\n\u201cEven a greater point to make is that you went to the Intel Committee, then you went to the IG, and you did not tell them,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cYou withheld that information. Then when you had a form, you should have checked that you had done that, you did not check that form either. You made a conscious decision not to tell the IG that you had already met\u2014and Schiff was asked this. Okay, let\u2019s go through Schiff\u2019s history, first he told America he had proof [of Russian collusion] beyond circumstantial. Well you know what? The millions of dollars and thousands of people looking at it\u2014Mueller\u2014could not find this fake proof that Schiff put America through a nightmare of for two years. Then we found out when they brought in Michael Cohen, his staff met with him how many hours? More than ten hours, three different times. We also found out later that Schiff also ran into Glenn Simpson\u2014remember Fusion GPS?\u2014and that he did not share that. Now, when he\u2019s asked on television, he was asked on his own home television MSNBC does he know who the whistleblower is? He said no. He says, \u2018I hope he comes forward, I hope he reaches out to us.\u2019 He openly lied\u2014numerous times.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, McCarthy said the decision to allow Schiff to continue to lead the investigation lies solely with Pelosi\u2014and he said that given Schiff\u2019s clear dishonesty and lies, it is time for Pelosi to formally remove him from the plum Intelligence Committee chairmanship. Failure to do so, McCarthy said, could put America\u2019s national security at risk given the fact that the Intelligence Committee handles America\u2019s secrets. But leaving someone who should clearly be a witness not an investigator in an investigatory role, McCarthy said, undermines the credibility of the Democrats\u2019 investigations\u2014making them purely partisan.\n\n\u201cTo be chair of the Intel Committee, it\u2019s just one person to appoint: the Speaker of the House,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI appoint the Intel Committee on the Republican side. I don\u2019t have to go through conference. The Intel Committee gets the top secrets that America ever sees, threats, and everywhere else. And this is a man who openly lies to the country to try to change the outcome of an election just because he doesn\u2019t like the outcome? One, he should no longer be chairman of that committee. She should remove him. Two, he does not have the right to be the head of the investigation. It\u2019s not the jurisdiction of his committee. But more importantly, he is a fact witness. He does not have the right to do that. If you believe in the rule of law, he does not have the ability to [lead the investigation]. Everything about this investigation proves it just is a political hack job to just try to go after the president.\u201d\n\nSchiff is hardly the only high-profile Democrat that McCarthy believes should be called as a witness in this investigation. He also said that former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, and other top leftists should also be called as witnesses for their roles in these matters.\n\n\u201cWhat I would to do is I would like to call Adam Schiff as a witness,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201dI would like to call Hunter Biden as a witness. I would like to see Vice President Biden as a witness. I would like to see Barack Obama as a witness, since he put Biden as envoy to Ukraine. These are all things we are being denied because they have already written the script that they want to impeach this president, they want to discredit democracy, and they want to change the outcome.\u201d\n\nBut for now, as the Democrats under Pelosi\u2019s stewardship keep the \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d as a partisan matter, McCarthy says, they continue to disregard norms and traditions when it comes to impeachment\u2014further undermining their case, and driving the fight even more into partisan camps.\n\n\u201cIn modern history, when they went to impeach Nixon, when they went to impeach Clinton, when they went to impeach two judges, there\u2019s always been a process for fairness that you\u2019d first have a vote to open an impeachment inquiry,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cAnd why you would do that as the full body, they literally say it in the past as to why: This is such an important vote. If you are going to discredit democracy by doing this, you shouldn\u2019t take it lightly. Everybody in America lends their voice to 435 members of Congress, so they should be heard on whether you move forward. What happens when you do that is they set the rules. In the Bill Clinton impeachment, there were 900 pages. They gave the minority subpoena power. They allowed the president to be able to know who the witnesses were, to object, to cross-examine, to do other stuff. Could you imagine going to trial and not being able to call a witness, not being able to cross-examine? So there\u2019s two reasons why Speaker Pelosi is doing this. One, she doesn\u2019t want to put her 31 members who are Democrats who sit in seats President Trump carried to cast that vote. Secondly, she wants to take advantage and not allow any fairness. She moved it out of Judiciary, which has the jurisdiction to do it, because she moved it into Intel. Why did she move it into Intel? Well, now we\u2019re finding out\u2014Schiff\u2019s staff met with the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy said that Pelosi prematurely launched the impeachment proceedings without getting the evidence. \u201cShe should have waited 48 hours until she read the transcripts, until\u2014she decided, she made a decision based on no facts,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy also explained that the House has voted on impeachment several times before\u2014and each time it failed. He also laid out a timeline of how Schiff seems to have orchestrated this entire latest \u201choax.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, we\u2019ve voted three times on impeaching this president,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cTwice, the Democrats brought impeachment up before the Mueller report even came forward. They have no proof whatsoever, but they\u2019re voting to impeach the president. Remember, the Washington Post just gave Adam Schiff four Pinocchio\u2019s over the claim that neither he nor his staff had spoken to the whistleblower before he filed his complaint. What did we find? On Aug. 12, whistleblower\u2019s complaint dated Aug. 12. On Aug. 28, Schiff tweets about withholding aid for the purpose of targeting a political opponent. Why would he know about that unless he talked to the whistleblower? Sept. 9, Schiff ordered a wide-ranging investigation. Sept. 17, he tells MSNBC \u2018we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower but we would like to. But Schiff\u2019s staff had already been in extensive contact. Sept. 19, Schiff insists to reporters that he doesn\u2019t know the details of the complaint. Sept. 23, Pelosi decrees impeachment inquiry. Sept. 25, the transcript is released. Schiff worked with this whistleblower all the way through and lied to the American public, trying to create it, just as he did before when he lied to the American public claiming he had proof beyond circumstantial evidence [of Russian collusion]. This is the problem. This is a hoax.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy said if the Democrats were interested in the facts and in being fair, they would have answered concerns he raised with Pelosi much more seriously and honestly\u2014concerns that were instead brushed aside by the Speaker from San Francisco.\n\n\u201cIf they truly believed in fairness, they would treat this president the same as we treated impeachment any other time\u2014have an impeachment inquiry vote,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI sent a letter to Pelosi just along those lines with a few simple questions: Is she going to give the minority the same rights that the minority has been given any other time? We had coequal subpoena power, because right now we don\u2019t. When we have those hearings, you know who controls who gets in the room? The Democrats. They can have all the people they want, but they limit the number of Republicans who can come into that room and staff others. Will they provide the president\u2019s counsel the right to attend all hearings and depositions? Will they provide the president\u2019s counsel the right to present evidence? Or what about to object? What about to cross-examine? Or what about to even recommend additions to the witness list?\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats are racing down the rabbit-hole of impeachment again, however, they continue failing to achieve any policy solutions for Americans whatsoever, McCarthy added.\n\n\u201cThe only thing they\u2019ve done are failed investigations,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThink of this. Here we are with the debate about China, where America is going to go, will we get fair trade, we have the USMCA\u2014the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement\u2014it\u2019s been 300 days since the president has signed it. Mexico has already ratified it. Canada is waiting on us. Mexico and Canada in the last month became our number one and number two traders. The president is going to sit down with Xi Jinping of China in November. Wouldn\u2019t it be smarter for America to have an agreement with our top two traders before we sit down with China? But, Nancy Pelosi has all the power to call USMCA up. She is more concerned about tearing down this president instead of building America up. What about prescription drugs? What about the crisis along the border? What about our veterans? All of that stopped because all they care about is impeaching the president. Every time we see it there is a common denominator. Adam Schiff is lying at the top to put America through a nightmare again with the very fabric of democracy that holds our country together. This has got to stop.\u201d\n\nThe political backlash against Democrats could be intense heading into the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, and McCarthy seems to think it will be. After winning North Carolina\u2019s ninth congressional district special election in September, Republicans only need to retake a net of 19 seats from the Democrats to retake the majority in the House. With, as McCarthy mentioned earlier in the interview, 31 Democrats representing districts that Trump won in 2016\u201413 of which Trump won by six percent or more\u2014that seems a very realistic goal for Republicans in 2020.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at this from the aspect of making a political gain,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWhat I really think about is the republic itself and the fairness. But what I see out there when I listen to the Democrats on the other side is they\u2019re very worried, and they should be. If you look, 63 percent of Americans do not believe anything in that phone call with Ukraine is impeachable. If you look at the majority of Americans, they don\u2019t see anything that the Democrats have accomplished except the investigations. You have found that Pelosi told the American people if they gave them the right to be the majority, that they would be different\u2014that they would govern different\u2014but now we found out that was not true.\u201d\n\nIf Republicans do take back the majority, McCarthy would presumably become Speaker of the House\u2013something President Trump has signaled he supports:\n\nLeader McCarthy, we look forward to you soon becoming Speaker of the House. The Do Nothing Dems don\u2019t have a chance! https://t.co/uWPdGJg99F \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 3, 2019\n\nMcCarthy also said with Pelosi answering to the \u201cSquad\u201d of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and others\u2014as well as the rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), whom McCarthy now expects will be the 2020 Democrat presidential nominee\u2014the Democrat Party is in leftist shambles, fractured to pieces by its leftist socialist flank, leaving a wide open lane for Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched these new socialist Democrats hijack the party, whereas I believe the only reason Nancy Pelosi agreed to an impeachment inquiry was the pressure from socialist Democrats,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cRemember, AOC tweeted that weekend against the Speaker again\u2014and then moved. Time and time again, many people believe she is only Speaker in name\u2014she doesn\u2019t have the power. When you look at the floor, she cannot pass anything because of this new AOC, Tlaib, Omar, and the others\u2014and then think about who is going to be their nominee for president. It is going to be Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s philosophy and beliefs are out of step with the majority of Americans.\u201d\n\nLISTEN TO HOUSE GOP LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:", "description": "McCarthy said Pelosi should formally sideline Schiff from the Democrats\u2019 \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Kevin-McCarthy-Serious-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
