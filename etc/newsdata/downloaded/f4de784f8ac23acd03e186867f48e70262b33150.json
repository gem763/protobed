We asked Jan to tell us more about the experience he had and how he came to witness such a spectacular sighting.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a week or so ago when one of my friends, Johnny and I went to a nearby park in Poland for a one-day local biking trail. We were pedalling on the top of the Magurka Mountain when we heard a very strange screaming noise just a few meters away from us coming from the side of the road. There was not much wind but the leaves on the ground were jumping round like there was. We stopped and went closer to have a look at where the sound was coming from and what we saw, was the incredible 'fight for life' of a frog that was caught by a snake!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe watched with mixed emotions as the power struggle between amphibian and reptile continued, the frog kept trying to enlarge its body size by taking big breaths of air to blow itself up like a balloon so that it would be too large for the snake to fit into its mouth, the frog also tried to bend its leg in an attempt to make it harder for the snake to swallow it. For a while, it seemed like the frog was winning the battle as it tried to escape with only one foot in the snake's mouth but the snake was smarter and positioned the other leg of the frog straight into its mouth, and from there, it was an easy lunch.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Brown snake eagle makes light meal of puff adder\n\n\u201cWe kept looking on as the snake started swallowing the frog whole little by little \u2013 despite the attempts of escape, still breathing. Once there were only tiny front legs visible from the snakes\u2019 mouth, the snake slithered away back into the forest.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe could not believe that we were able to capture such an incredible sighting. It was a day planned for only biking and what we saw was way more than we had originally bargained for. The way the snake seemed to dance a little, trying to wiggle the pray deeper into its stomach before moving off was amazing. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my entire life, I never knew that a frog can scream that much!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to snakes, don\u2019t panic, stay a safe distance away from any venomous or dangerous snake and just take your camera and shoot.\u201d\n\n*Compiled by Marisa Crous\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
