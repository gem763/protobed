They believed a policy of appeasing Iran would strengthen moderates, and reorient the Middle East, and they were hostile toward traditional U.S. allies in the region \u2014 the Arab states and Israel.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s case, however, his Iran policy is all over the place. He decided to pull out of the Iran deal, but then short arm the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, and now wants to offer concessions in exchange for a meeting that would be a diplomatic coup for Iran without doing anything to advance U.S. interests. It\u2019s unclear why Trump wanted to pull out of the deal in the first place if this is how he followed through.\n\nThere are multiple possible explanations for this vacillation. One is that Trump has competing impulses on foreign policy \u2014 wanting to seem tough, wanting to avoid conflict. The other is that he has advisers pulling him in different directions \u2014 hawks, non-interventionists who portray any toughness with Iran as a prelude to war, and those like Mnuchin who are sympathetic to Obama\u2019s policies.", "description": "", "authors": ["Philip Klein", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion"], "top_image": ""}
