Trump Regarding Turkey's Actions in Northeast Syria pic.twitter.com/ZCQC7nzmME \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nFollowing Trump's announcement, US Vice President Mike Pence said he was being dispatched to the Middle East to try to mediate the crisis.\n\nHe said Trump had told Erdogan on a phone call on Monday to agree to an immediate ceasefire.\n\n\"The United States of America simply is not going to tolerate Turkey's invasion in Syria any further. We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table,\" Pence told reporters.\n\nUS troop withdrawal\n\nTrump's announcement came as US politicians ramped up their pressure on the administration to take action over Turkey's military operation, now in its sixth day.\n\n191014053832727\n\nErdogan said the offensive is aimed at removing the Kurdish-led forces from the border area and create a \"safe zone\" to which millions of Syrian refugees can be returned.\n\nTrump reiterated he would pull the remaining US troops out of Syria, apart from a small group in the southern part of the country, and said they would be redeployed elsewhere in the region to monitor the situation.\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said on Sunday that the US withdrawal would be done carefully to protect the troops and to ensure that no US equipment was left behind. He declined to say how long that might take.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump defended his decision to withdraw US troops, tweeting: \"I said to my Generals why should we be fighting for Syria ... and Assad to protect the land of our enemy? Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China or Napoleon Bonaparte\".\n\nTrump added: \"I would much rather focus on our Southern Border which abuts and is part of the United States of America.\"\n\nRepublican Lindsey Graham, who is usually a Trump supporter, appeared to respond to those comments on Twitter, saying the US's \"FIRST line of defense is the US military working with partners\" in the Middle East to keep armed groups \"over there so they can't hurt us here at home or hurt our allies like Israel\".\n\nLast week, Graham said he was planning on introducing a bill with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen that would impose sanctions on the Turkish military.\n\nA Turkish forces tank is driven to its new position after was transported by trucks, on a road towards the border with Syria in Sanliurfa province, Turkey [Emrah Gurel/AP Photo]\n\nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, who is also normally a staunch Trump supporter, said he was \"gravely concerned\" by events in Syria and Trump's response so far.\n\nWithdrawing US forces from Syria \"would re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,\" he said in a statement. \"And such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States' strategic interests.\"\n\nAnother top Republican, Representative Mike McCaul, said the sanctions announced on Monday do not go far enough.\n\n\"We appreciate the administration's planned sanctions, but it does not go for enough to punish Turkey for it egregious offences in Syria,\" McCaul's office said in a statement.\n\nA statement from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senators Robert Menendez and Jack Reed said the only person who is able to \"immediately stop this tragedy unfolding is the president himself.\"\n\n\"The first step when Congress returns to session this week is for Republicans to join with us in passing a resolution making clear that both parties are demanding the president\u2019s decision be reversed,\" they said.\n\nEsper said on Monday that he would ask NATO allies to take \"collective and individual diplomatic and economic measures in response to these egregious Turkish actions\".\n\nBattle for Manbij\n\nMeanwhile in Syria, Turkish-backed rebel Syrian forces launched an operation to seize the strategic city of Manbij from Kurdish forces.\n\nMonday's drive came as Syrian government troops started moving towards the country's border with Turkey after Damascus forged an agreement with the Kurdish-spearheaded Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to fend off Ankara's military push, in a Russia-brokered deal that once again reshaped alliances in Syria's multilayered conflict.\n\nThe agreement with the Syrian government marked a major reversal for the Kurdish-led forces, a long-time ally of the US that was now seen as moving closer to Iran and Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's main military backers.\n\nA Turkey-backed Syrian rebel fighter gestures to the camera at the border town of Tel Abyad, Syria [Khalil Ashawi/Reuters]\n\nThe return of Syrian government forces to the region - where the SDF has sought to create an autonomous federation - could meanwhile further cement al-Assad's hold over the country, and raise the risk of a direct clash confrontation between forces loyal to him and Turkish-led troops.\n\nErdogan, however, played down suggestions that his troops and allies would go to war with Russian-supported Syrian government forces, citing Monday Moscow's \"positive approach\". He added, however, that Turkey's operation against Kurdish forces will intensify as he announced Manbij as the next target of the offensive.", "description": "Trump vows to swiftly destroy Turkey's economy if Ankara continues down 'this dangerous and destructive path' in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/13/d2e2a970ed94416196d58fc44f8490a8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
