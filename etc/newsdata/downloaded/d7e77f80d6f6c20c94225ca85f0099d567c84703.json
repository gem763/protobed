REUTERS/Danish Ismail\n\nIn the single bloodiest incident in recent months, two police officials said the five men - all construction workers from West Bengal state in eastern India - were shot dead in the Kulgam district. One person was injured.\n\n\u201cFive-bullet ridden bodies were discovered from the room where these labourers were staying,\u201d one of the two police officials said. Both officials declined to be named since they are not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nMilitants have been fighting Indian rule over Kashmir for nearly three decades, and police say that these groups have increasingly targeted non-Kashmiris either working in the state or doing business there since August.\n\nIndia accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir, which Islamabad denies. Both countries claim the region in full but rule in parts.\n\nThe latest killings followed a day of stone-throwing protests across parts of Kashmir after a weeks-long lull, triggered by the arrival of 23 EU lawmakers.\n\nResidents voiced anger that the federal government was trying to show the delegation Kashmir was returning to normal, even as most mobile phone and Internet connections remain severed and daily life disrupted by a security clamp-down.\n\nTwo officials, one from the government and the other from the police and both declining to be named, said demonstrations began anew in around 40 different locations in the Himalayan territory, including the main city of Srinagar.\n\nThe demonstration in Srinagar started hours before the EU delegation\u2019s arrival and continued through the day. The security forces fired tear gas, the police official and Reuters witnesses said.\n\nAt least eight protesters were treated at Srinagar\u2019s main SMHS hospital for injuries.\n\nProtesters also pelted security forces with stones in at least six other towns, the police official said.\n\n\u2018RETURNING TO NORMAL\u2019\n\nIndian officials say the situation in Kashmir is returning to normal and hope the EU visit will help counter international condemnation of the government\u2019s handling of the situation.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi received the EU lawmakers on Monday and said their visit would give them a clear view of the development priorities of Kashmir, his office said.\n\nBut opposition parties were angry that the EU lawmakers were being allowed into a region from which most Indian politicians have been barred since Aug. 5, when New Delhi revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status and stifled dissent.\n\n\u201cMPs (members of parliament) from Europe are welcome to go on a guided tour of Jammu and Kashmir while Indian MPs are banned and denied entry,\u201d Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet. \u201cThere is something very wrong with that.\u201d\n\nIndian security officials turned back several opposition politicians from Srinagar airport over the last several weeks, saying the situation was not stable enough for such visits.\n\nNew Delhi says its revocation of Kashmir\u2019s special status is essential to integrating India\u2019s only Muslim-majority territory into the rest of India and spur development there.\n\n\u2018HOLDING US AT GUNPOINT\u2019\n\nThe EU delegation - some of them from far-right parties - was driven in a cavalcade of black SUVs, accompanied by armed troops and security jeeps, to a military cantonment in Srinagar. This was to be followed by meetings with civil society members and businessmen, two government officials told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cThe government is trying to fool them. If they want to know the ground reality, they should meet the common people,\u201d said Srinagar resident Altaf Ahmed, standing near the site of a protest in the city\u2019s old quarter. \u201cWe want to tell them that the government of India is holding us at gunpoint.\u201d\n\nAt dusk, the EU lawmakers made their way to Srinagar\u2019s picturesque Dal Lake for boat rides on the mirror-calm waters, while security men swarmed the popular tourist site.\n\nThe U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) in Geneva on Tuesday urged Indian authorities \u201cto unlock the situation (in Kashmir) and fully restore the rights that are currently being denied\u201d.", "description": "Five people were killed by militants in Indian Kashmir on Tuesday, police said, as a group of European Union lawmakers began the first visit by a foreign delegation to the disputed region since New Delhi revoked its autonomy in August.", "authors": ["Fayaz Bukhari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446140546&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0NQ", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
