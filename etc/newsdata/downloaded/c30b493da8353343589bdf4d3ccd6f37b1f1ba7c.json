He tweeted about the ordeal.\n\nOn the impetus for forming #StopRobbingUs, \u201cWe just got tired of [the harassment]. I personally got tired of it, which is why I spoke out and with other people decided to take action,\u201d Tijani told TechCrunch on a call.\n\nHe described the shakedown of techies as the best and worst of Nigeria colliding, when it comes to shifting perceptions and stereotypes of the country.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking one of the most positive things that\u2019s happening on the continent, but also Nigeria in the last 10 years, and turning it into self-destruction,\u201d Tijani said of the law enforcement maltreatment of tech sector workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gross abuse of police stop and search\u2026The people that are supposed to protect use are ultimately harassing us and robbing us,\u201d iRoko CEO Jason Njoku said of the profiling and extortion of young Nigerians with laptops and smartphones.\n\nHe characterized the theft of laptops as taking away the means for techies to earn a living.\n\n\u201cA lot of people can work around not having a laptop, but if you\u2019re a developer, how do you code without a laptop,\u201d he said.\n\nNjoku, Tijani and members of #StopRobbingUs have been talking to senior members of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Enabling Business Environment task force and the Governor of Lagos State \u2014 the geographic district in Nigeria where much of the country\u2019s tech activity takes place.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to set up some kind of fund, which does advocacy and\u2026also lines up lawsuits\u2026to force the issue in a more formal way,\u201d said Njoku.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also an education thing. We\u2019re reaching out to the powers that be, to engage and educate them to find some kind of solution to this.\u201d\n\nBoth Njoku and Tijani see the #StopRobbingUs movement as a forerunner to an innovation industry advocacy group in Nigeria to speak to the broader needs of the country\u2019s tech community.\n\nThe West African country is home to the continent\u2019s largest economy and largest population of 200 million.\n\nIn addition to still being known for large-scale and petty corruption, Nigeria has made strides in improving infrastructure and governance and has one of Africa\u2019s strongest tech scenes.\n\nThe country is now a focal point for VC, startup formation, and the entry of big global tech companies in Africa.\n\n\u201cI still see a bright future for fintech and internet companies in Nigeria. I think it makes sense for use to be much more vocal on the things that may or may not make sense to us. Technology, media, and entertainment right now is the hope for a lot of young people in this country,\u201d Njoku said.\n\nHe added his company, IROKO, and startups he\u2019s invested in account for roughly 1000 jobs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to the point where tech will become one of the biggest drivers of employment in this country,\u201d Njoku said. \u201cIt makes sense for us to demand the respect and recognition from government to\u2026do the right thing to give us that fertile ground to keep building these companies.\u201d\n\nCcHub\u2019s Bosun Tijani is in accord with Njoku on the necessity of an tech industry advocacy group in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe do need a voice at the table, a voice that can contribute to getting what we need from government\u2026and the #StopRobbingUs campaign may be the trigger,\u201d he said.", "description": "Nigeria\u2019s #StopRobbingUs campaign to curb police harassment of techies could grow into a formal lobbying group for the country\u2019s tech sector, according to founders Bosun Tijani and Jason Njoku.
