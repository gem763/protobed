Of GM vehicles sold in the U.S., 22% are produced in Mexico.\n\nWall Street continues taking a dim view of the proceedings, with traders driving stocks of the country\u2019s largest automaker down 10% since just before the work stoppage began.\n\nEstimates of the production cuts, which have affected at least 55 GM facilities nationwide, are in the vicinity of $1 billion overall. Losses of potential North American profits are roughly $80 million per day, according to JPMorgan.\n\nOn Monday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she is concerned about the growing impact of the strike.\n\n\u201cThese things are important, that they try to remedy them and find some common ground as quickly as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nMonday also saw GM add to the list of plants it has closed in Canada and Mexico, shutting down an engine assembly line at its Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico, idling about 415 workers.\n\nThe longest major strike in decades is unfolding amid rising fears of slowing national economy, stirred by concerns that President Trump\u2019s trade war with China is taking its toll on U.S. manufacturers.\n\nOn Monday, the National Association for Business Economics released its quarterly outlook with economists predicting the U.S. gross domestic product would expand less than 2% next year, the slowest rate since 2016. The White House\u2019s trade war was cited as the leading threat to global growth.\n\nA prolonged auto strike could play a major role in the 2020 presidential race, pundits say, especially in the rust belt swing states of Michigan and Ohio \u2014 the very heart of the UAW-GM standoff. Michigan voters in the 2016 election supported Mr. Trump over his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by less than 1 percentage point.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls have jumped at the opportunity to support the strikers, with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota all having joined picket lines.\n\nMr. Trump has been seen as walking more of a tightrope between the blue-collar support he needs to win Ohio and Michigan and long-established anti-union sentiments within the Republican Party. He initially voiced concerns over the work stoppage but has been relatively quiet since it first began.\n\n\u201cIt is an easy opportunity for Trump to try and weigh in as a nontraditional Republican candidate,\u201d Michigan State University political scientist Matt Grossmann told The Washington Times. \u201cBut there is a risk of upsetting Republican voters who do not support the UAW.\u201d\n\nMr. Grossman added that many striking workers note how vocal Mr. Trump has been in the past about U.S. manufacturing jobs heading overseas and \u201csome have pointed out that they were hoping that Trump would weigh in more\u201d on the strike.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
