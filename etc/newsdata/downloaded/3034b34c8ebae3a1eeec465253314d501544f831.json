"Starbucks has a secret menu of Friends-themed drinks", "language": "en", "text": "No one seems to enjoy coffee more than the Central Perk-loving characters on Friends, so it's only fitting that some Starbucks baristas have celebrated the 25th anniversary of the show's premiere with secret drink menus inspired by the sitcom.\n\nEagle-eyed fans have been sharing photos of the Friends-themed offerings written on chalkboard signs at various Starbucks locations around the world \u2014 though it's important to note the unofficial items have been created by individual employees and not the coffee giant's corporate team.\n\nAs TotallyTheBomb.com first reported, a few locations made specialty drinks while others curated menus featuring variations of popular beverages that baristas thought the characters would most likely order based on their personalities.\n\nBrilliant: Various Starbucks locations have created secret Friends-themed menus in honor of the 25th anniversary of the show's premiere in September 1994\n\nYum: A Starbucks in Bellville, Ontario, rolled out a 'Friends Frappuccino' (L and R) inspired by the purple in Monica's apartment and the orange couch seen in the show's opening credits\n\nLast month a Starbucks in Bellville, Ontario, rolled out a bright pink 'Friends Frappuccino' in celebration of the anniversary of Friends first airing on NBC on September 22, 1994.\n\nThe manger of the location told Bustle that the drink was 'inspired by the purple of Monica's apartment' and the iconic orange couch seen in the show's opening credits.\n\nThe drink is a Raspberry Cr\u00e8me Frappuccino with a blended scoop of dragonfruit and a ring of Pumpkin Sauce inside the cup.\n\nA Flat White for Ross: A Starbucks in Modesto, California, gave the show's six main characters his or her own beverage based on what each of them would most likely order\n\nFYI: Other locations had similar ideas, though the unofficial beverages have been created by individual baristas around the world and not the coffee giant's corporate team\n\nHowever, a recreation may be hard to come by as Raspberry Cr\u00e8me Frappuccinos seem to be a secret menu item in itself.\n\nOne of the quirkiest secret beverages is 'The Smelly Cat,' which is named after Phoebe's infamous song.\n\nAccording to TotallyTheBomb.com, it's a Vanilla Bean Frappuccino made with coconut milk, a splash of guava juice, and dragonfruit.\n\nMeanwhile, a Starbucks in Modesto, California, was among the locations that gave the show's six main characters his or her own beverage.\n\nThey're lobsters: 'The Rachel' is a a Skinny Caramel Macchiato with an added shot, while 'The Ross' is a Flat White\n\nThe Rachel\n\nBaristas in Modesto determined that the waitress-turned-fashion executive is best summed up by a Skinny Caramel Macchiato with an added shot.\n\nA Starbucks Caramel Macchiato is made with a blend of freshly steamed milk and vanilla-flavored syrup that is marked with espresso and topped with caramel drizzle for an added burst of sweetness that is just as irresistible Rachel.\n\nAnother location came up with a similar \u2014 albeit slightly more complicated \u2014 version of 'The Rachel': an Iced Caramel Macchiato with skim milk, upside down, and with extra caramel.\n\nThe Ross\n\nOrdering 'The Ross' in Modesto will get you a Flat White, a perfect beverage of choice for a paleontology professor and a father-of-two.\n\nAccording to Starbucks, a Flat White has steamed whole milk poured over two shots of concentrated espresso and topped with 'microfoam.'\n\nMore than one Starbucks location concluded that Ross's go-to drink would be the Flat White.\n\nPerfect pair: 'The Monica' is a Nitro Cold Brew, while 'The Chandler' is a Salted Caramel Mocha\n\nThe Monica\n\nWhether Monica is cleaning her apartment or waging in a friendly competition, the chef is known for being meticulous in everything she does.\n\nSTARBUCKS DRINKS INSPIRED BY FRIENDS The Rachel A Skinny Caramel Macchiato with an added shot or an Iced Caramel Macchiato with skim milk, upside down, and with extra caramel The Ross A Flat White The Monica A Nitro Cold Brew or black coffee with an added shot of espresso The Chandler A Salted Caramel Mocha or a Starbucks Double Shot of espresso The Phoebe A Pumpkin Spice Latte or a Coconut Green Tea Latte The Joey A Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino or a Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino with White Mocha\n\nIt only makes sense that baristas in Modesto dubbed the trendy Nitro Cold Brew as the culinary expert's drink of choice.\n\nThe Nitro Cold Brew is created when Starbucks' signature Cold Brew is infused with nitrogen as it pours from the tap.\n\nNitrogen infusion creates microbubbles, giving the coffee a cascading, frothy texture,' according to the coffee giant's website.\n\nThe Chandler\n\nChandler is best known for his witty quips, but sometimes he can be a little salty when it comes to his insults.\n\nOrdering 'The Chandler' in Modesto will get you a Salted Caramel Mocha.\n\nThe fall favorite is made up of mocha sauce and toffee nut syrup combined with coffee and steamed milk.\n\nThe completed beverage is topped with sweetened whipped cream, caramel drizzle and a blend of turbinado sugar and sea salt.\n\nAnother location deduced the character would best be represented by a Starbucks Double Shot of espresso.\n\nLike Chandler, the no-nonsense drink is straight to the point.\n\nBasic: 'The Phoebe' is a Pumpkin Spice Latte, while 'The Joey' is a Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino with White Mocha\n\nThe Phoebe\n\nThe Pumpkin Spice Latte has become the must-have fall drink for 'basic' women everywhere, but baristas in Modesto think it screams Phoebe.\n\nThe seasonal classic in a combination of espresso and steamed milk with the flavoring of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove.\n\nHowever, another location went in a completely different direction with the eccentric character's eponymous beverage, dubbing a Coconut Green Tea Latte 'The Phoebe.'\n\nThe Joey\n\nIt's easy to imagine Joey anxiously awaiting Pumpkin Spice season, which is likely why multiple Starbucks determined a Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino best represented the actor.\n\nTo create the beverage, pumpkin spice flavors are blended with coffee, milk, and ice and topped with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice.\n\nBaristas in Modesto added an extra element to 'The Joey' by offering a Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino made with White Mocha.", "description": "Eagle-eyed fans have been sharing photos of the Friends-themed
