Since then he has set up his own pillow company, attributing his business success to his \u201csharp\u201d, \u201cstreet wise\u201d character.\n\nYou always get big characters straight off the bat and then ones that slightly sit back \u2013 did you have a strategy going into the first task?\n\nI\u2019d watched previous episodes and I know people say not to be the project manager to start with, but I think, in this situation, I wish that I was the project manager because I like being in control. I think I should have been a bit more assertive in terms of what I wanted to do, and in terms of whether it was the selling side or the tour side. So that was my downfall.\n\nAt least you got a trip to South Africa out of it, I suppose.\n\nYeah, that was a nice surprise. I\u2019d never been to South Africa, so absolutely.\n\nYour big scene in the episode was when you were trying to get those last-minute sales in the bar and you seemed to freeze a bit \u2013 what happened there?\n\nI think it was just a long day, to be honest with you. At that point it just didn\u2019t work out for me. And it was probably because I\u2019m just not a natural salesperson, which is why it came out like that.\n\nWas it frustrating that Thomas leapt in and tried to take over the sale?\n\nHe probably did the right thing. But I don\u2019t like disappointing people, so it was just a situation which I couldn\u2019t control at that point in time.\n\nThomas is definitely one of the show\u2019s biggest characters so far. Did you get along with him?\n\nThomas is a great guy, and he\u2019s a market trader and he does that for a living. Maybe his sales style is a bit aggressive? Which doesn\u2019t work in all situations. But you kind of adapt to the situations, and although we worked together, it\u2019s probably not my selling style that I normally would do.\n\nWere you sad not to see much of Lord Sugar?\n\nYeah. I don\u2019t think he was able to see my potential because my skill set is around product development and [things that would be better in] some of the technology tasks \u2013 creating and designing and pitching to corporate environments. So I think he definitely missed out on those opportunities to see my skill set, so that was a shame.\n\nHe at least said that \u201cit is with regret\u201d that he had to fire you, which must have been a slight silver lining at least?\n\nI highly respect Lord Sugar and I think it was a difficult one for him. Clearly it\u2019s a selling task and he had to be objective. And at the start of the series, he probably doesn\u2019t know anybody, so he had to [choose] based on the objective data.\n\nWould you have done things differently in the first task if you could?\n\nI think I would have requested to be on the tour side and probably been more assertive and made sure that I was on that side. When I was put on the selling task, I think I accepted it because you need to adapt and demonstrate that you can sell as well. I think that was the only thing that I would probably change.\n\nYou said in your official biography \u201cI love business more than sharks love blood\u201d \u2013 did you come up with that yourself?\n\nYou can use all sorts of phrases, but I thought this one was one that demonstrated that I do like business, and I thought it kind of rolled off your tongue. I sort of blended some words together and thought that made sense.\n\nSo what\u2019s next for you?\n\nLet\u2019s see what opportunities the future brings me. But as long as I\u2019m out there helping people in terms of connecting products and services to the cloud to make a difference to their lives, that\u2019s what I want to focus on. That\u2019s the way forward.\n\nThe Apprentice airs every Wednesday on BBC One at 9pm\u200b", "description": "Shahin Hassan may have the boxy chin of a superhero, but even that wasn\u2019t enough to save his skin in the first episode of The Apprentice series 16.
