Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. \u2014 who lead the Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, respectively \u2014 asked him to produce documents by Oct. 15.\n\nSpokespeople for Giuliani and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Giuliani has suggested he may not comply with committee requests. On Sunday, he told ABC that he \"wouldn't cooperate\" with Schiff as long as he leads the panel.\n\nThe subpoena adds to the heightened scrutiny of both administration officials and outside Trump confidants after the House decided last week to move forward with impeachment proceedings. On Friday, the Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents. The heads of the Appropriations and Budget committees also asked Friday for records related to the Office of Management and Budget's involvement in the Trump administration deciding to hold back nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.", "description": "In a letter to Giuliani, the heads of three House committees asked for information related to efforts to get Ukraine to investigate the Biden family.", "authors": ["Jacob Pramuk"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106156423-1569873419900preview.jpg?v=1569873434", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
