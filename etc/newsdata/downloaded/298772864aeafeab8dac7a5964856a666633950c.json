But the patterns and bucket hats didn\u2019t take away from the classic sophistication he brings to his designs.\n\nTahari said he was inspired by New York in the 1970s, around the time he immigrated to the U.S. from Israel.\n\n\u201cDowntown, Soho, the art scene - New York was vibrant and it\u2019s vibrant now,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nTo show off the New York spirit Thursday at Fashion Week, Tahari used polka dots and animal prints on everything from a long rain slicker to swingy skirts and dresses. He carried over the patterns to his ever-present hats.\n\nHe also used a range of silhouettes. There were bell sleeves on a gingham seersucker mini dress, oversized blazers cinched with belts and a trench coat lined with leopard print, slung over the shoulders of a satin slip gown.\n\nTahari said he hoped women wearing his collection would feel confident, comfortable and elegant. Wide patch pockets were meant to evoke a worker\u2019s spirit, according to his show notes. He layered some of his dots to look like a modern animal print.\n\nIt was a juxtaposition between industrial and creative, he said. His models wore chunky heels with ankle straps or bright wide sneakers.\n\nActress Amy Hargreaves of \u201cHomeland\u201d and \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d said Tahari\u2019s mix is what drew her to the brand.\n\n\u201cWhat I like about Tahari is that it\u2019s classic, but with an edge,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of stuff that the regular woman can wear to work but you could also go out at night afterward.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Elie Tahari didn't shy away from playful elements in his spring-summer 2020 collection.
