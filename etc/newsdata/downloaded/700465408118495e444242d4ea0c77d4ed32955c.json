Thus, 40% of the S&P 500 will have released quarterly results by next Friday.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) report this week, as does Visa (NYSE: ). Apple (NASDAQ: ) doesn\u2019t report until October 30th.\n\nSummary / conclusion: Writing the S&P 500 earnings update this Saturday morning, October 19th, 2019, while watching the Brexit vote in the UK Parliament, (which was delayed again to October 31) we are reminded once again of the glacial pace at which politics can move, which can be a good thing since it prevents rapid changes in economic conditions. Still with Brexit as with China trade, the damage has been done so to speak as corporate CEOs have to grapple with the uncertainty of what the rules look like (or will look like) once there is a resolution to both issues.\n\nEven with Friday\u2019s drubbing, the S&P 500 finished the week higher by 0.55%.\n\nCorporate high yield debt ETFs like iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond (NYSE: ), SPDR\u00ae Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE: ), iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE: ) continue to be bid decently, as all three ETFs were higher on the week, between +0.28% and +0.37%.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Rick Reider does one of the best monthly economic and fixed-income updates that I\u2019ve seen over the years and while Rick and slide show give evidence that job growth is slowing, probably due to manufacturing slowing, a recession doesn\u2019t appear to be on the horizon.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Brian Gilmartin covering: Microsoft Corporation, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Visa Inc Class A.
