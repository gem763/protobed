I hate to talk about him. You know why? I don\u2019t think he's got a chance,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump said that the then-vice president was in charge of Ukraine policy for the Obama administration and sought the firing of the then-Ukrainian prosecutor general while his son, Hunter \"was paid massive sums of money [to] buy a Ukrainian energy company.\"\n\n\"Now that\u2019s what you call quid pro quo,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump ripped the news media for calling his allegations of corruption \"unsubstantiated,\" despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nThe president's attacks on the former vice president came hours after acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneySondland could provide more clues on Ukraine controversy Tensions flare as Democrats urge consumer bureau to boost penalties White House conducting probe into handling of Ukraine call transcript: report MORE said during a briefing with reporters that aid for Ukraine was tied in part to Trump\u2019s desire for help investigating the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server and 2016 election interference.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nMulvaney later sought to walk back his comments, instead claiming that \"the only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\u201d\n\nTrump has publicly urged Ukraine and China to look into the Bidens. Those comments are at the heart of an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats.\n\nHunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas giant in Ukraine, in 2014. The company's founder was under investigation by then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who the U.S., United Kingdom and other Western governments argued had failed to rein in corruption in the country.\n\nThe U.S. threatened to withhold roughly $1 billion in loan guarantees if Shokin was not replaced as prosecutor general, a message Joe Biden delivered to officials in Kiev while serving as vice president and recounted during a 2018 Council on Foreign Relations conference.\n\nTrump has also claimed that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from China, similarly alleging it is evidence of corruption involving the former vice president and his family.\n\nHunter Biden has business connections to China, but there is no evidence of how much he's made or that it had any relation to his father's work while in office.", "description": "President Trump on Thursday accused Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden of engaging in a quid pro quo hours after his own acting chief of staff appeared to admit that the Trump administration had done the same with Ukraine before seeking t", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald3_101719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
