According to Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, the financial sector\u2014one of the poorest-performing sectors this year\u2014has a 27% weighting in the Russell 2000 and just 21% for the Russell 1000. In contrast, the technology sector\u2014one of the year\u2019s best performers\u2014has just a 13% weighting in the Russell 2000, versus 22% for the Russell 1000.\n\nThese different sector exposures are a big reason why the small-cap sector has been such a laggard this year, Mr. Young says. Through the end of August, Vanguard Russell 1000 ETF has markedly outperformed Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF\u201418.2% to 12.0%.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making bets that certain sectors will outperform others, of course. You may very well believe that the financial sector will outperform the overall market in coming months, and that the tech sector will lag behind. But you won\u2019t want to make those wagers if you are attempting to make a pure play on the so-called small-cap effect\u2014the historical tendency for small-caps to outperform large-caps.\n\nLarge Stocks vs. Small Performance of the Russell 1000 (large stocks) and Russell 2000 (small stocks) year to date, daily 25 % 20 Russell 2000 YTD change 15 10 Russell 1000 YTD change 5 0 \u20135 J F M A M J J A S 25 % 20 Russell 2000 YTD change 15 10 Russell 1000 YTD change 5 0 \u20135 J F M A M J J A S 25 % 20 Russell 2000 YTD change 15 10 Russell 1000 YTD change 5 0 \u20135 J F M A M J J A S 25 % Russell 2000 YTD change 20 15 10 Russell 1000 YTD change 5 0 \u20135 J F M A M J J A S\n\nTo construct that pure bet, you can\u2019t invest in any of the index funds that are benchmarked to small-cap indexes. You instead would have to construct a portfolio of small-cap stocks whose sector weightings are no different than those of the entire market.\n\nThat is easier said than done, of course. But Kent Daniel, a finance professor at Columbia University and a former co-chief investment officer at Goldman Sachs, argued in an interview that it is worth the effort. He also said it is important to hedge out other factors that also could be skewing your portfolio away from a pure bet on the small-cap effect.\n\nFor example, the Russell 2000 index currently contains stocks that, on average, are more volatile than those in the Russell 1000. That means that, when investing in the Russell 2000, you are making an implicit bet that high-volatility stocks will outperform low-volatility issues. That is just the opposite of what, on average, has been true in the past. To construct a pure bet on the small-cap effect, therefore, you need to hedge out not only sector and industry bets but also this bet that high volatility will outperform.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to construct a small-cap portfolio that looks identical to the large-cap portfolio in all relevant respects except the market cap of its constituent stocks. The list of those relevant respects is quite long, containing everything from varying geographical and regional exposures to different levels of financial quality and profitability. However, Prof. Daniel said that perhaps the most important factor to hedge away is varying industry and sector exposures.\n\nFor a recently completed study, he and several other researchers constructed a fully hedged small-cap portfolio. Its performance since 1963 has been just as good as the unhedged version, but with half the risk, he says.\n\nThat is a winning combination, of course, since it enables you to double what you otherwise invest in small-cap stocks without incurring any more risk.\n\nProf. Daniel also did the same for other market factors besides market cap, and reached even more encouraging results. The factor portfolio for which hedging extraneous exposures made the biggest difference, Prof. Daniel says, is the value portfolio, which bets that stocks with low price-to-book ratios will outperform those with high ratios. That is because, at some points over the past six decades, the sector weightings in this value portfolio became extremely skewed.\n\nNow is one such time, by the way. Consider the technology sector, which has just an 8.4% weighting in Russell\u2019s value portfolio, compared with a 36.1% allocation in the Russell\u2019s growth portfolio. Another big difference is in the weighting of the financial sector: In the value portfolio, this sector enjoys a 24.2% weighting, versus 12.9% in the growth portfolio.\n\nUntil an ETF or mutual fund is constructed that puts Prof. Daniel\u2019s insights into practice, the best way for you to act on his research is to hedge out the most extreme exposures of whatever factor portfolio you\u2019re investing in. If you were betting on value over growth, for example, you would want, in addition to investing in a value index fund, to reduce your effective exposure in financials (by selling short some stocks in that sector) while simultaneously increasing your exposure in the tech sector. Note that you could do this without putting up any more money, since you can use the proceeds of the stocks you sell short to purchase the additional stocks.\n\nDoing that may be more than you are inclined to undertake on your own. But the rewards of doing so are sufficient that you may nevertheless want to try.\n\nAt a minimum, though, you should be aware of the many extraneous bets you are implicitly making when you are otherwise trying to make a pure play on small-caps over large-caps, or value over growth.\n\nMr. Hulbert is a columnist whose Hulbert Ratings tracks investment newsletters that pay a flat fee to be audited.
