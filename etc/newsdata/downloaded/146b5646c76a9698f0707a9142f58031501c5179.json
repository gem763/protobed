The indictment came after a ten month investigation by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the FBI, according to a release from Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman.\n\nWilkins instructed an unnamed person to murder the deputy who was planning to publicly reveal a tape of him using \"racially offensive language to authorities in Raleigh\" in August 2014, according to a felony indictment unsealed Monday. Wilkins allegedly said \"the only way to stop him is kill him,\" and encouraged the individual to \"take care of it.\"\n\nThe sheriff discussed the time and location where the murder might occur with the would-be assassin, according to the indictment. He also counseled him on how to avoid getting caught, telling him that if \"you ain't got the weapon, you ain't got nothing to go on,\" the indictment alleges.\n\nGeorgia police hired rape suspect: Serial rape suspect arrested by Georgia police more than a year after they hired him\n\nHe allegedly advised him not to tell anybody and promised he wouldn't reveal the plan to authorities.\n\n\"The only way we find out these murder things is people talk,\" Wilkins said, according to court records. \"You can't tell nobody nothin', not a thing.\"\n\nFreeman, the district attorney, told the News & Observer that Wilkinsdoesn't have to step down yet. He has served as the county sheriff since 2009.\n\n\"Technically,\" Freeman said, \u201che can continue to serve if he chooses to until convicted.\u201d\n\nGranville County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nWilkins was released on a $20,000 bond on Monday and will appear in Granville County court on October 9. A second investigation in allegations concerning the sheriff's office's \"accounting practices and controlled substance interdiction efforts\" is also ongoing, Freeman said.\n\nDNA leads to cold case arrest: Ex-law enforcement officer charged in 'horrific' sexual assaults\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sheriff indicted for plotting murder over 'racially offensive' tape", "description": "A North Carolina sheriff was indicted for obstruction of justice for allegedly plotting to kill one of his deputies.", "authors": ["N'Dea Yancey-Bragg", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.x7GzzwRz1f3bYRzGAE8Ag--~B/aD01MjU7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/69c65a9ba8e21fe80aa9cfda2e58ce5a", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
