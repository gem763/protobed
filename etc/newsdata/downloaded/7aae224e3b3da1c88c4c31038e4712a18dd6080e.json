Kurdish leaders call the replacement of indigenous Kurdish populations with largely Arab refugees an attempt at ethnic cleansing; Ankara claims it necessary because the Kurds are \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nTurkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ), who make up most of the SDF, indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist group. The YPG were integral to the defeat of the Islamic State in Syria and responsible for most of the fighting in the liberation of Raqqa, the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Islamic State caliphate.\n\nThe Turkish invasion \u2013 aided by the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a coalition of Syrian Arab rebel groups including some jihadist elements \u2013 followed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to relocate a small contingent of 50 U.S. soldiers out of Rojava. America\u2019s military presence is only legal to fight the Islamic State, an al-Qaeda offshoot, as per the 2001 Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against al-Qaeda.\n\nThe SDF stated in a press release Wednesday that Turkey had begun using Syrian civil war refugees to enact \u201cdemographic change in Rojava\u201d and were using \u201call kinds of weapons\u201d to eradicate the Kurds.\n\n\u201cThe practices of the Turkish affiliated forces are similar to ISIS, even though these forces have different names,\u201d the Syrian Democratic Council, the civilian wing of the SDF, said.\n\n\u201cThe Autonomous Administration reaffirms that what Turkey is doing amounts to genocide and occupational practices,\u2019 the statement continued. \u201cWe appreciate the positions of the regional and international powers, and all legal and human rights organizations that condemned this aggression.\u201d\n\nThe council accused the Turks and their proxies of \u201cterrorism\u201d and vowed to \u201cremain committed to restore [sic] stability and security\u201d in Kurdistan.\n\nSpeaking to the Kurdish outlet Rudaw, medical professionals treating the civilian victims of the Turkish onslaught suggested that they are showing signs of having been attacked with chemical weapons.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of fears that prohibited weapons are being used in Sari Kani. Wounds we treat at the hospitals are not normal injuries at all,\u201d Dr. Manal Mohammed, head of the Rojava Health Board, which is treating many of the victims, told Rudaw. \u201cOur health board is currently investigating to find out what type of weapon is being used against us. Like I said, wounds we treat are not normal at all.\u201d\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali posted a video of children covered in what appeared to be acid burns, stating that the SDF believes \u201cunconventional weapons are being used\u201d by either the Turkish military or the FSA.\n\n[Warning: graphic video]\n\nAfter 8 days of fierce resistance by our fighters against heavy ground and aerial attacks of Turkey in Ser\u00eakaniy\u00ea, we suspect that unconventional weapons are used against SDF fighters upon the reports and signs we receive from the besieged town. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/Epr1BsDFhC \u2014 Mustafa Bali (@mustefabali) October 16, 2019\n\nWhile the SDF have been careful to refer to the weapons as merely \u201cbanned\u201d or \u201cunconventional,\u201d Rudaw noted that at least one Kurdish official has speculated that the weapons being used as napalm and phosphorus gas, chemical weapons banned by international law. Bali reportedly stated that the doctors treating the victims believed to have been exposed to banned chemicals lack the technology required to properly identify the specific type of chemicals used.\n\nThe Turkish government has adamantly denied possessing banned chemical weapons or using them; the FSA has not at press time issued any statement in its defense.\n\nChemical weapons use has been a central recurring theme of the Syrian Civil War nearly since its inception in 2011, when the only actors participating in it were dictator Bashar al-Assad and the Free Syrian Army rebels. Assad has faced accusations of chemical weapons use on multiple occasions and faced military repercussions, including attacks from the United States, for allegedly using the weapons. One study found evidence for at least 300 separate chemical weapon attacks by Assad during the span of the war.\n\nIn 2016, Erdogan, a Sunni Islamist, announced Turkey\u2019s intention to invade Syria \u201cto end the rule of the tyrant Assad, who terrorizes with state terror.\u201d Assad is an Alawite Shiite and is allied with the world\u2019s largest Shiite nation, Iran.\n\nErdogan insisted that any Turkish military activity in Syria would not be \u201cfor any other reason\u201d than deposing Assad.\n\nAssad\u2019s Syrian Arab Army has allied with the SDF in light of American troops leaving the region, as Congress has yet to authorize President Trump to send troops to defend the Kurds. Assad forces have reportedly moved into key Rojava towns and cities, like the border town of Kobani, to protect it from Turkish attack.\n\nThe Turkish government has adamantly denied the use of chemical weapons. It has nonetheless boasted through state media and friendly publications \u2013 the only ones left after Erdogan\u2019s media purges in 2016, save for the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet \u2013 that its military has \u201cneutralized\u201d nearly 700 Kurdish \u201cterrorists,\u201d the former a term Turkey uses to mean fighters killed or imprisoned, but currently no longer able to remain on the battlefield. Turkish officials claim to have \u201cliberated\u201d 1,220 square kilometers of territory of its Kurdish population and seized \u201c130 long-barreled guns, 180 hand grenades, 17,871 ammunition, 27,534 kilograms (60,702 pounds) of explosive material, 10 rocket launchers, [and] 232 rocket launchers ammunition.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Kurdish fighters accused Turkey and its proxies of genocide against the Kurdish people and using tactics \"similar to ISIS.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Syrian-Democratic-Forces-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
