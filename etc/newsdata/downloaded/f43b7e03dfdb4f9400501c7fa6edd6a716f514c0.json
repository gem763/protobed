It turned many neighborhoods in Kawagoe into swamps.\n\nCrews were working across central and northern Japan on Monday to dig through mudslides and search riverbanks for those missing in the storm, which killed dozens of people and left thousands of homes on Japan\u2019s main island flooded, damaged or without power. Some 30,000 people were in evacuation centers.\n\nAn upturned car lies next to a partially destroyed house after being hit by a tornado shortly before the arrival of Typhoon Hagibis, on Oct. 13, 2019, in Chiba, Japan.
