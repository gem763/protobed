(Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Jimmy Carter said Tuesday that President Donald Trump\u2019s White House is \u201ctrying to stonewall\u201d House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nCarter, who became the oldest living President in history by celebrating his 95th birthday last week, was questioned on MSNBC about whether it was right that the White House block people from testifying.\n\n\u201cNo, I think that\u2019s a departure from custom and a departure from what American people expect,\" He answered. \"I think that\u2019s one of the main things Americans are now considering is the fact that the White House is trying to stonewall and not provide adequate information.\"\n\nJimmy Carter: 'The White House is trying to stonewall' https://t.co/PXJXdPf2Ec via @MSNBC \u2014 Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cI think that within itself is going to be another item of evidence used against him [Trump] if he continues to stonewall and prevent the evidence to be put forward to the House of Representatives and Senate to consider.\" Carter elaborated.\n\nOn any advice for Trump, Carter stressed for him to \"tell the truth, I think, for a change\" and chuckled when recommending Trump \"cut back on his Twitter feed.\"\n\nHe reiterated that Trump needs to \u201cgive the House of Representatives, and also the Senate, and I say the general public, the evidence that we need to form a case either for or against him.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, President Trump and the State Department blocked European Union Ambassador Gordan Sondland from appearing before a trio of Congressional committees to answer questions about his role in pushing Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, causing House Democrats to say they will now subpoena him.\n\nTrump defended his decision by tweeting \"I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public.\"\n\nI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nCarter, who served as the 39th President from 1977 to 1981, was sporting a black eye during the MSNBC interview. Two days prior, he suffered a fall at his Georgia home, and needed stitches \"above his brow,\" according to the Carter Center.\n\nThe 95-year-old continued to build homes for Habitat for Humanity the day after the fall.\n\nCarter reiterated that he aligns with his party on its feelings about the impeachment inquiry into Trump, praising House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to launch the probe. But, he emphasized that it is \"very unlikely\" that the Republican majority Senate would convict Trump and remove him from office.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/08/jimmy-carter-trump-stonewall-impeachment-inquiry/3911226002/", "description": "Jimmy Carter stressed for Trump to \"tell the truth, I think, for a change\" and chuckled when recommending him to \"cut back on his Twitter feed.\"", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
