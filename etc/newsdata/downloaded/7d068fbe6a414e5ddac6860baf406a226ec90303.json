In the evening she lined up for her first capped match. \"I love my job, the school is very accommodating and it also took my mind of the nervousness of the first game. It's been quite an experience,\" she revealed.\n\n\"People said it was a shame I didn't get my first cap in the Pro League at a big stadium but I didn't mind that, being at Bisham was more intimate.\"\n\nGreat Britain edged the three-match series 1-0 thanks to two late goals from Lizzie Neal and Anna Toman in a 2-2 draw on Friday. The week had certainly been a trying one for Wilkinson. Having played in friendly matches against India, she turned out for Holcombe last weekend, took part in the three capped India matches and was back playing for Holcombe in their 1-1 draw against Loughborough Students on Saturday. \"I think they are testing my age,\" joked Wilkinson.", "description": "There was a former student of Leah Wilkinson's on the touchlines last week as Wales' most capped sportsperson appeared in a Great Britain women's shirt for the first time during the India series.", "authors": ["Rod", "Jim White", "Michael Vaughan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/hockey/2019/10/07/Leah-Wilkinson-right-in-action-for-Holcombe-CREDIT-SIMON-PARKER-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
