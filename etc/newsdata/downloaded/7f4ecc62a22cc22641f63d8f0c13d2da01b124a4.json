The infection rate rose three percent from 2017.\n\nIt's the most ever reported in a year, though the trend is mainly attributed to increased testing.\n\nAbout 580,000 gonorrhea and 35,000 cases of syphilis were reported last year, rivaling records set in 1991.\n\nAnd, noted the CDC, they are seeing an alarming rise in newborn deaths from congenital syphilis, with nearly 100 infants dying of the disease in 2018.\n\nMore than 1.7 million cases of chlamydia (pictured, under a microscope) were reported in 2018, the highest number reported in a single year (Dr E Arum, Dr N Jacobs/CDC via AP, File)\n\nRates of gonorrhea reached their the highest number since 1991, increasing five percent between 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn 2018, there were an astounding 35,000 confirmed cases of the disease.\n\nAnd the syphilis rate rose 15 percent with about 35,000 cases of the most contagious forms of the disease were reported - also the most since 1991.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the numbers Tuesday.\n\nThe increases coincided with public health funding cuts and clinic closures.\n\nMeanwhile a startling new trend in congenital syphilis has emerged.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the number of newborn babies that died of syphilis increased by 22 percent.\n\nPregnant women with syphilis can pass the infection to the fetus they're carrying.\n\nAlthough it's easily curable in adults, untreated syphilis can wreak havoc on the brain, heart and nervous system.\n\nAnd it can have devastating effects on developing babies.\n\nThe infection may trigger a miscarriage or result in still birth.\n\nBabies with congenital syphilis are at risk of premature birth and low birth weights.\n\nAltogether, 40 percent of babies delivered by women with untreated syphilis die before, during or shortly after delivery.\n\nAnd those that survive may have brain and nervous system problems, skeletal defects and low blood counts.\n\nLast year, 94 infants died of congenital syphilis, according to the newly-released CDC data, a 'startling' increase over 2017's 77 deaths, according to Dr Gail Bolan, director of the agency's Division of STD Prevention.\n\n'This goes beyond data and surveillance, beyond numbers and calculations - we lost 94 lives before they even began to an entirely preventable infection.'\n\nWith 1,306 cases of congenital syphilis reported, 2018 had the greatest number of these chronic infections since 1995.\n\nAlthough 41 US states reported cases, 70 of them occurred in five states: Texas, California Arizona and Louisiana.\n\nThe CDC officials say that transmissions of syphilis, as well as other STIs, is driven by impoverished areas and low condom use among young people and men who are gay or bisexual.", "description": "US infections from gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia have risen for the fifth consecutive year, including a record-setting 1.7 million cases of chlamydia in 2018, new data from the CDC says.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/17/wire-19451416-1570551807-181_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
