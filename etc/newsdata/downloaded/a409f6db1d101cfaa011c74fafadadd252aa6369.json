Their underperformance led it to push back the release dates of Gods & Monsters, Rainbow Six Quarantine, and Watch Dogs: Legion into its next financial year.\n\n\u201cCritical reception and sales during the game\u2019s first weeks were very disappointing,\u201d CEO and cofounder Yves Guillemot said in a press release, referring to Breakpoint. Ubisoft underestimated the difficulty of drumming up interest in a sequel to a live multiplayer game, especially after updating and improving the original game, he said.\n\nThe company also realised gameplay innovations \u201cneed to be perfectly implemented\u201d after Breakpoint\u2019s changes \u201cgenerated very negative reaction\u201d and were \u201cstrongly rejected by a significant portion of the community,\u201d Guillemot said. A third problem was Breakpoint\u2019s failure to stand out, he added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not happy with the fact that our decision here impacts significantly the short term of our financials, but we believe that we\u2019re taking then this opportunity to definitely further elevate the quality of all of our games by coming with stronger identity features, differentiation,\u201d Guillemot said. Future games will also feature \u201coriginal new formulas\u201d and \u201chighly optimised experiences,\u201d he added.\n\nGuillemot shared more details about Breakpoint\u2019s issues during a call with analysts. \u201cThere were more bugs than expected at the launch,\u201d he said, and players viewed its large online store as a cash grab and it was \u201creally not appreciated at all.\u201d\n\nUbisoft assumed a gap of 30 to 36 months would be long enough for a sequel, but that timeframe was too short to optimise gameplay and build enough anticipation and momentum, Guillemot said. Changes to gameplay can be \u201cunsettling\u201d so they have to be seamlessly introduced to win over players, he added. Ubisoft also recognises all its games need to be \u201cstrongly differentiated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group tried to take the sting out of its profit warning by announcing bullish forecasts for the year to March 2021. It expects 2.6 billion euros in net bookings and 600 million euros of adjusted operating income, although those figures are flattered by anticipated revenues from the delayed games.", "description": "Ubisoft shares plunged 16 percent on Friday after it released a profit warning, delayed a trio of video games, and announced an overhaul of its development process....", "authors": ["Alex Walker", "Zack Zwiezen"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2018/06/ubisoft-e3-2017-aisha-tyler.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
