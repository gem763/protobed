Customers can see whether McDonald's locations near them are serving the McRib by entering their zip code on the company's McRib locator: mcdfinder.com.\n\nPart of the McRib's appeal is this scarcity. The McRib doesn't return every year or to every location, meaning that McRib super-fans often need to hunt down the polarizing sandwich while it is available.\n\nAlan Klein, the creator of the McRib Locator, told Entrepreneur magazine in 2013 that he \"nearly drove four hours last year to get one\" but \"found there was one closer as I prepared to leave.\"\n\n\"If the McRib were to return to a more sporadic availability, I certainly could see myself taking a longer trip to find one,\" he added.\n\nIn 2018, McDonald's served the McRib at roughly 9,000 locations \u2014 the menu item's largest rollout in recent years. This year, McDonald's is highlighting the return of the McRib by launching Instagram story GIFs celebrating the sandwich, searchable on the app using the hashtag #McRibSZN.\n\n\"We're always listening to our customers and we know the McRib has some of the most loyal fans,\" chef Chad Schafer, senior director of culinary innovation and commercialization at McDonald's USA, said in a statement.\n\nThe McRib first hit McDonald's menus in 1981. Since then, the sandwich has become one of the most beloved and polarizing menu items at the chain, surviving three farewell tours in 2005, 2006, and 2007.", "description": "McDonald's is rolling out the McRib at more than 10,000 locations across America, starting October 7.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d960af96428f7210779de6d?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
