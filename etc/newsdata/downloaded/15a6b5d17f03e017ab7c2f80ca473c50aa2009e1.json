(AP) - Chiefs wide receiver Sammy Watkins will miss his second consecutive game with a hamstring injury when Kansas City visits the Denver Broncos on Thursday night trying to snap a two-game skid.\n\nWatkins was a limited participant in practice this week but was ruled out Wednesday.\n\nThe Chiefs are down several starters as they face a division rival on short rest. Defensive back Kendall Fuller was ruled out after breaking his thumb in last week\u2019s loss to Houston, defensive tackle Chris Jones and left tackle Eric Fisher have core muscle injuries, and left guard Andrew Wylie is out with an ankle injury.\n\nCornerback Bashaud Breeland was listed as questionable with a non-injury designation. If he\u2019s unable to play, the Chiefs would have Charvarius Ward, Mo Claiborne and rookie Rashad Fenton at cornerback.\n\nThe Chiefs did get some positive news in that middle linebacker Anthony Hitchens would be back on the field. The on-field play-caller missed last week\u2019s game with a groin injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chiefs wide receiver Sammy Watkins will miss his second consecutive game with a hamstring injury when Kansas City visits the Denver Broncos on Thursday night trying to snap a two-game skid.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
