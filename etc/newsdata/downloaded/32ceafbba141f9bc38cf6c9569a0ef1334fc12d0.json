Ron DeSantis ousted the woman responsible for winning Trump Florida in 2016.\n\nIn the homestretch of the 2018 campaign for Florida governor, Donald Trump walked into the hold room before a big rally, looked GOP nominee Ron DeSantis in the eye and pointed to a nearby political operative.\n\n\u201cSmartest thing you\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Trump told DeSantis, according to a source who witnessed it, referring to the Florida Republican\u2019s decision to hire Susie Wiles to rescue his flagging gubernatorial campaign.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump was speaking with first-hand knowledge.\n\nIn 2016, when Trump was widely expected to lose Florida, he hired Wiles to manage his campaign, partly on the recommendation of then-Gov. Rick Scott, who had hired Wiles to run his campaign in 2010 when he was expected to lose. Both Trump and Scott won unexpected victories. So did DeSantis.\n\nThe real shocker, however, came this week. Wiles was fired from the Trump campaign Tuesday after DeSantis suspected she bore responsibility \u2014 unfairly her friends say \u2014 for the leak of internal correspondence showing how the new governor appeared to be selling access to special interests on golfing trips. Wiles was also pressured to part ways with Ballard Partners, a top state lobby firm.\n\nThe brutal public defrocking of Trump's advisor in the nation\u2019s largest swing state \u2014 which has the utmost strategic and sentimental value to Trump \u2014 left many Republican insiders and Trump campaign officials fuming that Wiles was mistreated. They also think it's detrimental to Trump\u2018s chances in Florida.\n\n\u201cLosing Susie Wiles is unfortunate and it\u2019s also dangerous. Susie is like a battle-tested field general,\u201d said Michael Caputo, a former 2016 Trump campaign adviser who also, like Trump, is a part-time Florida resident.

And tinkering with the leadership that helped him win in the first place is just a bad idea,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cVery few people understand statewide Florida politics for an outsider candidate like Susie Wiles does. I know the president has deep appreciation for her magical touch in the state. I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d\n\nWiles would not comment for this story, but in the past has been careful to downplay her role in Trump\u2019s win, saying the credit belongs solely to him. Of the 24 Republicans interviewed for this story on background or on the record, all echoed the same sentiment.\n\nBut nearly all of them \u2014 including four current and former Trump campaign officials \u2014 credited Wiles\u2019 for bringing order to a disorderly campaign in 2016. They pointed to her deft management of presidential campaign logistics, her ability to navigate between the egos of Trump\u2019s team and the warring Republican factions loyal to the national party, and also her skill at serving as a go-between with Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s re-election campaign, which he launched after losing in the bitter presidential primary to Trump earlier in the year.\n\nLater, Wiles would play the role of Republican peacemaker between DeSantis and Scott, who had a tense relationship that began to color the new governor\u2019s perceptions when he took over in Tallahassee.\n\nIncreasingly, though, DeSantis loyalists began to view Wiles as too loyal to Scott.\n\nShe had been brought into DeSantis\u2019 orbit just a month before Election Day 2018 to revive what many Republicans viewed as a mistake-prone campaign limping through the final months of the race against Democrat Andrew Gillum. DeSantis eked out a win following a recount.\n\nBut tensions and suspicions grew, especially after the two most important political advisers in DeSantis\u2019 orbit \u2014 chief of staff Shane Strum and his wife, Casey DeSantis \u2014 went to the Florida GOP headquarters in Tallahassee in April to check it out. Among some DeSantis insiders, there was a feeling that the party was stocked with \u201cSusie people,\u201d setting off a chain of events that led to DeSantis and Strum asking the Trump campaign for a new \u201chand-picked\u201d top staffer at the state party.\n\nThe relationship between Wiles and Strum had deteriorated beyond repair, or as one veteran Republican lobbyist told POLITICO in August it had \u201cbeen poisoned,\u201d which both Strum and Wiles have denied. DeSantis, according to two sources, also became frustrated with word in Tallahassee\u2019s gossipy political circles that Wiles needed to be hired as a lobbyist to have influence with his administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on what's hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

DeSantis donors in Florida also contacted the Trump campaign and lobbied for her ouster, a source said.\n\nWiles was pushed out Tuesday, less than a year after Trump lauded her hiring before he took the stage at an Oct. 31 rally near Fort Myers.\n\nThe DeSantis power play underscored the clout the swing-state governor has with Trump and his campaign in Florida. Aside from Florida\u2019s crucial role in the Electoral College, the Trump campaign has deep roots in the state \u2014 it\u2019s home to the president\u2019s winter resort, Mar-a-Lago, as well as Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio and Parscale, a recent transplant.\n\nDeSantis owes his political fortunes statewide in Florida to Trump, whose endorsement of the once-little-known congressman gave him a critical edge in the GOP primary against longtime Republican figure Adam Putnam, then the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner. But now, Trump needs DeSantis more than the governor needs the president.\n\nTo her friends, the abrupt termination appeared unnecessarily punitive: Wiles had been serving in an advisory role to the campaign and had not done much this year as she attended to health and family issues.\n\nThose who know Wiles say they don\u2019t believe she would be so disloyal as to leak documents in the first place \u2014 especially such sensitive ones that bear her name.\n\n\u201cIf anyone thinks it\u2019s a leak by Susie Wiles, they\u2019re dumb,\u201d said Curt Anderson, a longtime adviser to Scott.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s level-headed, doesn\u2019t get excited, is detailed and organized and she doesn\u2019t get off track,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cShe\u2019s not some flashy, loud-mouth ad-maker or consultant. She does her job and does it well.\u201d\n\nTrump aides said no replacement for her has been settled on, and some expressed skepticism that someone would formally fill that position. Still, there was hope among some that Wiles would make a comeback if the race in Florida gets too close for comfort.\n\n\u201cThe moment something goes wrong in Florida, Trump won\u2019t give a fuck about what Ron DeSantis thinks,\u201d said one Trump advisor. \u201cTrump made DeSantis and if he objects to Susie coming back, he\u2019ll be told to shut the fuck up and mind his own business.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s on-again-off-again adviser Roger Stone, who initially advised his presidential campaign in 2016 and is also a Florida resident, said he believes the 2020 campaign will be tough and, though he believes Trump will win, it makes little sense to remove someone with the institutional knowledge of Wiles.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably the single-most effective operative in the state. She\u2019s delivered not one, not two, but three times: Trump, DeSantis and Scott,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThis is a mistake they might regret.\u201d\n\n", "description": "A power play by Florida Gov.
