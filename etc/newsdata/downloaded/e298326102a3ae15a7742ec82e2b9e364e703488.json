It serves to further reduce and limit strategic offensive arms, that is to limit the entire range of strategic weapons, the entire strategic triad: land-, sea- and air-based combat inter-continental ballistic missile launchers.\n\nAlso on rt.com Moscow has done its homework: Russia will be least affected if US exit from INF treaty brings back arms race, Putin says\n\nThe agreement between the US and Russia, conceived in the 1980s, has been the cornerstone of international stability and arms control for nearly three decades. Its latest iteration is set to expire in 2021, and, so far, Washington has not responded to Moscow\u2019s proposals on how to amend and extend the landmark treaty.\n\n\u201cThis treaty expires in 2021. To make sure it is extended, we need to be working on it right now. We have already submitted our proposals; they are on the table of the US administration. There has been no answer so far,\u201d Putin said, adding that it looks like the US has not decided yet whether it wants to extend the treaty at all.\n\nEarlier this year, Washington withdrew from another major arms control deal, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The move was a \u201cmistake\u201d on the US\u2019 part, Putin stated, explaining that even though the agreement only pertained to the US and Russia, while other nations were free to develop such weaponry, \u201cit was not worth ruining the deal.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com World sleepwalking into total nuclear war as callous elites fear no bloodshed \u2013 Russian scholar\n\nThe potential demise of the last major arms control agreement will certainly make the world \u201cmore dangerous,\u201d and cause other, rather unpredictable consequences, the Russian president warned.\n\nIf this treaty is not extended, the world will have no means of limiting the number of offensive weapons, and this is bad news. The situation will change, globally. It will become more precarious, and the world will be more dangerous and a much less predictable place than today.\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won\u2019t tell you.", "description": "The potential demise of the last arms reduction treaty left standing \u2013 New START \u2013 will change the global situation and make the world a \u201cmore dangerous\u201d place, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da48a122030270a192f0e83.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
