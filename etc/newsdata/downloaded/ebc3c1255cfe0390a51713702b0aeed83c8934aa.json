Once they arrived in the middle of the floor, ropes floated down from the ceiling above them and seamlessly placed dresses and hats over their heads.\n\nIn a video shared on Twitter, one attendee said drones were used to dress each model. In a statement sent to Insider, however, representatives for Issey Miyake said that pulley systems were actually used.\n\nAfter each model was dressed, they began to hop in place onstage. Their dresses moved with them, as they were seemingly made from spring-like fabric.\n\nThe models eventually moved from their spots and began to prance around the runway.\n\nPulley system-enhanced dresses weren't the only unique fashion displays on the Issey Miyake runway.\n\n\n\nThe brand also had some models skateboard across the stage while wearing neon jumpsuits with capes.\n\nJapanese fashion designer Issey Miyake's enchanting display of fashion and innovation at #PFW.
