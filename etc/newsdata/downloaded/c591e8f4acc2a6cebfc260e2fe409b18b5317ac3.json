Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), have written a letter asking payment processors Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe to reconsider their involvement with Facebook\u2019s new digital cryptocurrency Libra. The Libra digital currency was started by Facebook and is designed to be used for online purchases and digital money transfers. Libra will be led by a group of different firms via the non-profit group the Libra Association and is planned to be launched in 2020.\n\nVisa, Mastercard, and Stripe are three of the 27 firms that comprise the Libra Association. The letter sent by the senators to the payment processors focused on a report from the Wall Street Journal which claimed that Visa and Mastercard were reconsidering their involvement with the project. The letter states:\n\nWe urge you to carefully consider how your companies will manage these risks before proceeding, given that Facebook has not yet demonstrated to Congress, financial regulators \u2014 and perhaps not even to your companies \u2014 that it is taking these risks seriously.\n\nAlthough the project has yet to fully launch and was only announced in June, it\u2019s already lost a major firm this week with PayPal announcing its departure from the Libra association.
