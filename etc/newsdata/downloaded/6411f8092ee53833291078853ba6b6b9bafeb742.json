Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who spent the week engaging in a lengthy Twitter tirade against the president\u2019s decision, ratcheted up his rhetoric on Wednesday morning against Turkey and the administration.\n\n\u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS,\u201d Graham tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cWill lead effort in Congress to make Erdo\u011fan pay a heavy price.\u201d\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, Graham announced legislation with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) that would impose aggressive new sanctions on Turkey.\n\nThe bill would sanction the U.S. assets of top Turkish leaders, including President Recep Tayyep Erdo\u011fan; it also would punish any foreign individual or entity who sells weapons or provides military aid to Turkey, or supports the country\u2019s domestic energy industry.\n\nVan Hollen, meanwhile, tweeted on Wednesday morning that Turkey must pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for its actions. \u201cSenators on both sides of the aisle won't support abandoning the one regional group most responsible for putting ISIS on its heels.\u201d\n\nTrump himself initially promised to impose crippling sanctions on Turkey if they moved forward with military action against the Kurdish ethnic minority, which has been a steadfast partner to American military efforts in the region for years but is viewed as a terrorist element by Erdo\u011fan.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBut by Wednesday afternoon, Trump appeared less committed to the fire and fury in the wake of the invasion, but indicated he had no problem with Graham\u2019s sanctions and still promised to \u201cwipe out\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Erdo\u011fan attempted to \u201cwipe out\u201d the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re speaking to both sides. We\u2019ve told President Erodgan how we feel, but we are speaking to both sides and we\u2019re seeing what can be made out of a situation, but we have no soldiers in the area,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked about the decision to abandon the Kurds. \u201cWe are getting out of the endless wars. We have to do it.\u201d\n\nThe president then, appearing to cite an article on TownHall.com, added the Kurds, \u201cdidn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy as an example\u201d \u2026 \u201cbut they\u2019re there to help us with their land, and that\u2019s a different thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all of that being said, we like the Kurds,\" he said.\n\nBy the time Trump spoke, Graham and like-minded lawmakers had already determined a tough response was warranted. \u201cWhile the Administration refuses to act against Turkey, I expect strong bipartisan support,\u201d Graham said of his legislation.\n\nIndeed, criticism was widespread in the GOP ranks for Trump\u2019s move. While Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the top House Republican, slammed the move by calling on Turkey to stop it instead of mentioning Trump, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), the number three House Republican, named names.\n\nThe president\u2019s decision to withdraw is \u201chaving sickening and predictable consequences,\u201d said Cheney. \u201cThe U.S. is abandoning our ally the Kurds, who fought ISIS on the ground and helped protect the U.S. homeland\u2026 This action imperils American security and that of our allies. Congress must and will act to limit the catastrophic impact of this decision.\u201d\n\nThe quick turn of events\u2014one of the harshest rebukes yet of GOP establishment foreign policy from a president who never warmed to it in the first place\u2014has left many Republicans on the Hill scratching their heads. \u201cWe have maybe one senator happy about this decision,\u201d a GOP staffer told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt perplexes me that we\u2019re in a position where the majority of Republicans who will carry the banner of Republicans in the post-Trump era are, saying this is not good.\u201d", "description": "Deilil Souleiman/GettyCapitol Hill managed a rare show of unity on Wednesday, as lawmakers from both parties recoiled in horror at a lightning-fast Turkish invasion of Kurdish territory in Syria and coalesced around the idea of responding through tough new sanctions on Turkey.\u00a0And nearly every single", "authors": ["Sam Brodey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gvz0IBx9XelpEHZLHISzvw--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/986b5cec977ee801b32576baf7143498", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
