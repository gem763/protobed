As we noted earlier,\n\n\u201cThe oil story won\u2019t get worse unless there is another attack. For now, the market will stay slightly elevated but with immediate supplies guaranteed the price will ease back to Friday\u2019s levels as the market will see this as a one-off event. Another drone attack, however, and all bets are off.\u201d\n\nThe price action in oil reflected the movement is risk FX with gapping lower by more than 50 pips at the open but pair climbed off the lows and was trading at 107.85 by London open reflecting the shrug-off attitude of the market. Even the dismal Chinese data which came in at 4.4% versus 5.2% eyed did not phase the market much as traders remained optimistic that US trade negotiations would ease tensions going forward.\n\nThere is little on the economic calendar today and the FX action will likely take its cue from US equities. If US traders shrug off the events in the oil market and push stocks higher risk FX should respond in kind with USD/JPY closing its gap open at the 108.00 level, but that\u2019s as far as the pair is likely to go as the dual tugs of war between US and China and US and Iran continue to dominate the macro landscape and although President Trump appears to be generally conciliatory as he tries to maintain a positive market environment to support his reelection, headline risks continue to lurk and markets will likely remain cautious for the time being", "description": "Forex Analysis by Boris Schlossberg covering: USD/JPY, XAU/USD, DAX, Nikkei 225.
