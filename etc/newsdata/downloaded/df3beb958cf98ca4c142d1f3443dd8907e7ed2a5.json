But that\u2019s the impression you get in the media right now.\u201d\n\nWriting in the Swedish paper Dagens Nyheter, academy members Mats Malm and Erik M Runesson admitted that Handke had \u201cdefinitely made provocative, inappropriate and unclear statements on political issues\u201d, according to a translation by the BBC. But they said that they had \u201cfound nothing in what he has written that involves attacks on civil society or respect for the equal value of all people\u201d, and asked: \u201cWhat we wonder is what sources the critics used and why Handke\u2019s own statements are ignored.\u201d\n\n'A troubling choice': authors criticise Peter Handke's controversial Nobel win Read more\n\nThe choice of Handke has drawn widespread criticism, due to the Austrian writer\u2019s denial of Serb atrocities during the Balkans war and his decision to attend the funeral of war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. His 1996 book A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia contested the facts of the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. In 2006, it was reported that when critics pointed out to Handke that the bodies of victims were evidence of Serb atrocities, the Austrian writer replied: \u201cYou can stick your corpses up your arse.\u201d\n\nHandke has been described as \u201cthe Bob Dylan of genocide apologists\u201d by Bosnian-American novelist Aleksandar Hemon. More than 38,000 people have signed a petition calling for the revocation of Handke\u2019s Nobel. The charity Remembering Srebrenica has said that his win \u201cendorsed ethnic and religious hatred, Serbian nationalism and genocide denial\u201d.\n\nNobel committee for literature members Henrik Petersen and Rebecka K\u00e4rde, part of the group that evaluates the nominations for the Nobel and presents recommendations to the Swedish Academy, have also defended the choice. Petersen, writing in the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, described Handke as an \u201canti-nationalistic\u201d advocate for peace, according to a translation by AFP.\n\n\u201cIn 50 years ... Peter Handke, just like Beckett, will be among the most obvious choices the Swedish Academy ever made, of that I am certain,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPeterson argued that Handke is \u201cradically unpolitical\u201d in his writing, and said his support for the Serbs had been misunderstood. The main thrust of his argument was that the Serbian point of view was missing in German and Austrian media.\n\nAlso writing in Dagens Nyheter, K\u00e4rde said: \u201cWhen we give the award to Handke, we argue that the task of literature is other than to confirm and reproduce what society\u2019s central view believes is morally right.\u201d\n\nWhile she wrote that she didn\u2019t want to \u201capologise for the hair-raising things that Handke has undoubtedly said and done\u201d, she said that the Nobel committee concluded that he \u201cabsolutely deserves a Nobel prize\u201d.\n\nHandke himself has said that he will never talk to journalists again following a deluge of questions about his political views. \u201cI\u2019m standing at my garden gate and there are 50 journalists \u2013 and all of them just ask me questions like you do, and from not a single person who comes to me I hear they have read any of my works or know what I have written,\u201d he told the Austrian broadcaster ORF last week. \u201cIt\u2019s only questions like how does the world react. Reactions to reactions to reactions. I am a writer, I come from Tolstoy, from Homer, from Cervantes. Leave me in peace and don\u2019t ask me questions like that.\u201d", "description": "Members behind decision to award Austrian writer the prize in literature say he will be seen as an \u2018obvious choice\u2019 in 50 years", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a19e8ee36130936a653ff62a8459fe5109862cef/0_157_5520_3312/master/5520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4419c10be2e80d84b2e464f7a3169a73", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
