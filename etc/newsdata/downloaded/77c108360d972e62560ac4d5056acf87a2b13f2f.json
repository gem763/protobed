The officer who was bitten was taken to hospital to be treated.\n\nSly grog flowed freely in the notionally alcohol-free precinct, the ABC reported. Richmond fans were filmed lighting signs and flares, actions that attracted some criticism online and perhaps singed an otherwise flawless day.\n\nSocial media videos quickly circulated showing a number of brawls near the Richmond station. Police were forced to intervene. Nearby, on Church Street, hundreds more revellers flooded the streets, throwing and smashing bottles on the ground.\n\nRumours that some of the Tigers players could make an appearance in Richmond got fans even more excited, with their loud roars audible from one street over.\n\nRichmond Tigers full of emotion in grand final celebrations Read more\n\nJust hours earlier, Emma Smith and her family, who describe themselves as \u201cfourth generation\u201d Richmond fans, were watching the match at the Tigers\u2019 home ground at Punt Road oval.\n\nEmma\u2019s kids came dressed like their mother in team colours, blending with the thousands of fans covered in yellow and black.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one big family here, in one big great spot with magnificent Melbourne sunshine,\u201d she said.\n\nThe crowds grew louder with each chorus of \u201cTigerland\u201d, the Richmond song belted out by victorious players after the match, and thousands of times subsequent by celebrating fans.\n\nLloyd Klaman (@LloydKlaman) This makes it official. \u201cChampions Baby\u201d#richmondtigers #AFLGrandFinal pic.twitter.com/NyRBCF8aWu\n\nThe noise from Swan Street \u2013 and the roar inside the MCG \u2013 well and truly drowned out the big, big sound expected from Greater Western Sydney, the expansion club playing in its first grand final. The Giants whimpered on the field, and the GWS fans had mostly fallen silent by the final siren.\n\nIn Sydney smaller crowds gathered to watch the game unfold. By the end of the brutal third term, Caitlin Goman, 25, and partner Adrian Verzin, 24, were among the fans who knew there was no chance of a comeback and no point in staying to watch the now-inevitable loss.\n\n\u201cWe gave it a crack, just couldn\u2019t kick a goal unfortunately,\u201d Goman said.\n\nDie-hard Giants fans Peter Murphy and his five-year-old son, Jack, stayed until the end to show their loyalty.\n\n\u201cI think everyone here in Sydney is really proud of them for what they did,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nWith AAP", "description": "Celebrations turn to chaos and police arrest dozens of rowdy fans outside pubs and on streets", "authors": ["Ben Smee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a486c59084302fc83eeaa8828b53a3a04778e097/8_0_4162_2497/master/4162.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d8c4039b8368201ba4ebba8f269fd29", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
