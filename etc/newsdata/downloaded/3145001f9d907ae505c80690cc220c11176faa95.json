The remainder of the profits were ceded to the Treasury in exchange for support.\n\n\u201cThese modifications are an important step toward implementing Treasury\u2019s recommended reforms that will define a limited role for the Federal Government in the housing finance system and protect taxpayers against future bailouts,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.\n\nIn order to move forward with recapitalization plans, Treasury and FHFA said further adjustments to the PSPAs may be necessary.\n\nThe plan to reform the mortgage giants \u2013 which have been under conservatorship for more than a decade \u2013 includes eventually removing the government-sponsored entities from conservatorship, which has been a longtime goal of the Trump administration.\n\nThe two GSE\u2019s do not originate loans \u2013 instead they purchase and guarantee them on the secondary market. They guarantee more than half of the nation\u2019s mortgages.\n\nMnuchin told FOX Business in November 2016 that the administration had to \u201cget them out of government control.\u201d\n\nTaking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out from under the government's thumb could be a boon to shareholders \u2013 who have essentially had shares wiped out. As of 2012, profits from Fannie and Freddie have been redirected to the U.S. Treasury. Some hedge funds, however, have been betting on their return to the private sector.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The mortgage giants will be able to retain a substantially larger share of their profits.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/freddie-mac-mnuchin-fannie-mae.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
