(NYSE:CPF) Is Yielding 3.3% - But Is It A Buy?", "language": "en", "text": "Dividend paying stocks like Central Pacific Financial Corp. (NYSE:CPF) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.\n\nIn this case, Central Pacific Financial likely looks attractive to investors, given its 3.3% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. The company also bought back stock during the year, equivalent to approximately 3.6% of the company's market capitalisation at the time. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNYSE:CPF Historical Dividend Yield, October 15th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Central Pacific Financial paid out 41% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Central Pacific Financial's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Central Pacific Financial's dividend payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$8.00 in 2009, compared to US$0.92 last year. Dividend payments have fallen sharply, down 89% over that time.\n\nWhen a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, and a poor history of shrinking dividends, it's even more important to see if EPS are growing. Central Pacific Financial's EPS have fallen by approximately 13% per year. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and Central Pacific Financial's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. We're glad to see Central Pacific Financial has a low payout ratio, as this suggests earnings are being reinvested in the business. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and its dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Central Pacific Financial might not be a bad business, but it doesn't show all of the characteristics we look for in a dividend stock.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Central Pacific Financial Corp.
