That discussion, which will be a focus of the 2020 legislative session, is expected to shape up as a major battle within the Democratic-majority General Assembly, and between Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and local lawmakers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHogan has already started pushing back, lashing out against the panel on social media, labeling it the \u201cKirwan Tax Hike Commission\u201d and launching a fundraising effort to oppose the funding plan.\n\nThe governor called the $4 billion price tag a \u201cpie-in-the-sky proposal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tremendous respect for Dr. Kirwan and have supported many of his well-meaning recommendations, some of which can be phased in over the next several years,\u201d Hogan said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the Kirwan Tax Hike Commission is hellbent on spending billions more than we can afford, and legislators are refusing to come clean about where the money is going to come from. Even after more than three years of meetings, there is still no clear plan whatsoever for how either the state or the counties will pay this massive price tag.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDel. Maggie McIntosh (D-Baltimore City), a member of the panel, said that \u201cthe money is there,\u201d jurisdictions just have to make education a top priority when creating their budgets.\n\nUnder the proposal, Prince George\u2019s County would see a 38 percent jump in its education costs, and Montgomery County would experience a 14 percent increase. The hardest-hit jurisdictions would be Kent County, which would go from spending $21 million a year to nearly $30 million, a 41 percent jump; and Baltimore City, which would double its spending from $331 million to $662 million. Others, which have paid more in past years, would see modest increases: for example, Baltimore County at 9 percent and Frederick County at 2 percent.\n\nAmong other things, the money would be used for pre-K expansion, teacher raises, behavioral health, special education, technology and grants for schools with high concentrations of students from low-income families.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the cost of quality,\u201d said Montgomery County Budget Director Richard S. Madaleno, a former state senator and a member of the Kirwan Commission, adding that state and local governments cannot afford to not increase investments in education.\n\nSen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), a member of the panel who supports the funding plan, noted that 1 out of 4 high school graduates earn a postsecondary degree in Maryland, while 2 out of 3 jobs in the state require a postsecondary degree.\n\n\u201cOver the next 10 years, we are not talking about an education crisis, we are talking about an economic calamity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the cost of the status quo.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "State and local governments would pay an additional $4 billion annually, starting in 2030.", "authors": ["Ovetta Wiggins", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bxVMwcvuGLmIt7IuBaUEXjzcTsU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3Q3ZQBQD4YI6TNVJBKS4F7GJ4Q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
