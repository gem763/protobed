Then you'll have plenty of opportunity this week.\n\nYou'll be battling plenty of robotic forces over the next seven days, with the flashy action shooter Daemon X Machina and Gearbox's Borderlands 3 both dropping on September 13. If you weren't an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, then this week will also be your first chance to bat back the Swarm with Gears 5, which is also available on Steam if you want.\n\nThe intriguing third-person RPG Greedfall drops on Tuesday Australian time, just in case you weren't spoiled for choice and/or a lack of time, and those wanting a little more challenge from their games might also want to keep an eye out on Blasphemous. Endless Space 2 gets an expansion, more content comes to the excellent Through the Ages, the neat Kind Words indie arrives on Steam, and then there's Castle Crashes Remastered, a bit of pinball, and some Lovecraftian horror on the Switch.\n\nIt's a busy week. Here's the fuller list:\n\nBorderlands 3 (PC, PS4, XBO)\n\nThe Sinking City (Switch)\n\nBattle Supremacy: Evolution (Switch)\n\nSuper Dodgeball Beats (Switch)\n\nDaemon X Machina (Switch)\n\nGreedfall (PC, PS4, XBO)\n\nStar Wars Pinball (PC, PS4, XBO, Switch)\n\nAge of Grit (PC)\n\nChop (Switch)\n\nAtomic Heist (Switch)\n\nRest in Pieces (Switch)\n\nDistraint (Switch)\n\nEllen (Switch)\n\nRitual (Switch)\n\nLEGO Jurassic World (PC, PS4, XBO, Switch)\n\nCastle Crashers Remastered (Switch)\n\nNHL 20 (PS4, XBO)\n\nThe Tenth Line: Special Edition (Switch)\n\nNascar HEAT 4 (XBO)\n\neFootball PES 2020 (PC, PS4, XBO)\n\nThe Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series (PS4, XBO)\n\nSecond Galaxy (PC)\n\nThrough the Ages: New Leaders & Wonders (PC, iOS, Android)\n\nEndless Space 2: Awakening (PC)\n\nMen of War: Assault Squad 2 Cold War (PC)\n\nSydney Hunter and The Curse of the Mayan (PC, Switch)\n\nKind Words (PC, Steam)\n\nAery (PC)\n\nTrailer time! Greedfall has gone under the radar quite a bit compared to some of the bigger names on this list, so we'll kick off with a story trailer and some gameplay.\n\nVery decent roster for the week with absolutely no shortage of things to play. And that's for everyone that isn't already preoccupied with WoW Classic, still working their way through No Man's Sky, Astral Chain, Control or any of the very, very good games that launched in the last few weeks.\n\nI'm gonna need to burn up some annual leave soon. But on what, I wonder...", "description": "Want to live the mercenary life?
