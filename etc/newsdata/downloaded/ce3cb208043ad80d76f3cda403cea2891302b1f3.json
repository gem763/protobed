The Nationals signed Corbin for six years and $140 million to cement a Big Three with aces Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, and then they prioritized adding a strong fourth starter. They traded away Tanner Roark and turned to free agency, signing Sanchez in December to a two-year, $19 million deal.\n\nSanchez is a kitchen-sink pitcher with two change-ups and multiple speeds on every pitch, and after getting released by Minnesota in March 2018, he had rebuilt his career in Atlanta with a 2.83 ERA over 24 starts.\n\nAD\n\nThen, the Nationals also made a push for Miley. They offered a one-year deal in the range of $4 million, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. But Miley wanted a longer contract so he signed with Houston, for two years and $6 million, and had a solid season that fell apart in September.\n\nAD\n\nMiley mopped up in the ALDS and wasn\u2019t on the roster in the American League Championship Series. Jos\u00e9 Urquidy has been average, and flashed potential, as a starter-reliever hybrid.\n\nThe bet on Sanchez looked riskier early this season. The right-hander lasted four innings and allowed four runs in his season debut against the Philadelphia Phillies, and by mid-May, he was 0-6 with an ERA over 5. He departed a start against the New York Mets after 1\u2153 innings because of a left hamstring strain.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Sanchez returned from the injured list, though, everything changed. He made his first start back against the juggernaut Atlanta Braves and allowed one hit and no runs over six innings. His resurgence coincided with the team\u2019s in late May, and he stabilized the fourth slot in the rotation.\n\nMartinez attributed the newfound success to refined mechanics. Sanchez used his legs more effectively. He threw with \u201cconviction.\u201d He stayed down in the zone. Sanchez thought \u201ceverything was the same\u201d pitching-wise before and after the IL.\n\nAD\n\nWhat Sanchez brought to the Nationals extended beyond a solid start every fifth day. When the team acquired Gerardo Parra in late May, when the veteran outfielder\u2019s infectious energy began transforming the clubhouse culture, Sanchez became an eager co-conspirator. He stood in line with Parra for free sunglasses, and they\u2019ve worn them in the dugout as good-luck charms all season. He started using the aux cord to blast Latin music in the clubhouse as often as possible, including slow Sunday mornings. He joined Parra in ritually hugging Strasburg in the dugout following Strasburg\u2019s starts.\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday night, Martinez praised what Sanchez has done this season and expressed confidence in the starter who seems to have more pitches every time he starts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been huge,\u201d Martinez said of the flexibility Sanchez affords. \u201cEverybody talks about our Big Three, but An\u00edbal has pitched unbelievable. \u2026 He gives us a chance to win ballgames every outing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nStaff writer Jesse Dougherty contributed reporting to this story.\n\nRead more World Series coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington has a fourth starter; Houston doesn't.
