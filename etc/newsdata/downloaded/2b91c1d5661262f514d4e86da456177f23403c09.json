They have also extensively given their thoughts on developments in driver human performance, racing tracks of the future and the fan experience we can expect to see in 2050.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nMcLaren have unveiled to fans their exciting take on the future of Formula One in the form of the 2050: the MCLExtreme\n\nThe exciting and daring futuristic design features an on-board artificial intelligence co-pilot for drivers and self-healing tyres\n\nRuling out flying cars - even in 30 years time - McLaren instead focused on delivering the most advanced race car ever\n\nArtificial intelligence is going to form a key part of technological advancement in the sport moving forward in coming years\n\nMcLaren's research also looked at the tracks of the future and how the overall fan experience would go on to differ from now\n\nIn an extensive breakdown of the various elements that the MCLExtreme includes, fans raved given it is a 500km/h rear-wheel-drive electric car powered by a 'foldable battery moulded to the aerodynamic package'.\n\nThis is not a new venture for McLaren having teased fans with futuristic designs back in 2015 when they released images and designs for its MP4-X.\n\nTechnology continues to evolve at a rapid rate but the notion of flying race cars was soon quahsed by both fans and engineers.\n\nEfficiency and a need to streamline the car's design was the basis for the research team when they began their discussions\n\nWhat they have produced is a stunning car with plenty of nods to future advancements in aero-dynamics and AI instructions\n\n2050: the MCLExtreme 500 km/h (310mph) inductively charged, electric car On-board advanced AI co-pilot Shape-shifting active aerodynamics\n\nIn the unveiling, McLaren wrote: 'Staying true to the sport's mission to be road relevant, we don't expect race cars to fly by 2050. Flying road cars equals more aerial congestion, more noise pollution and probably more accidents.\n\n'If you think drone sightings at airports cause wide-scale disruption, well... you know the rest. With the emergence of high-speed underground transportation portals, such as Virgin Hyperloop One, building underground networks that shift large volumes of traffic in less time is more probable.\n\n'This is in keeping with the desires of the fans we spoke to, who believe flying race cars are the antithesis of grand prix racing.'\n\nEfiiciency is absolutely essential for successful racing teams and chasing quicker times rarely ever puts efficiency at risk.\n\nBut with cars getting faster, a fascinating feature on the latest design sees contractible side-pods that alter depending on the natural conditions.\n\nDesigners have looked into every element of the car and one key decision was to add sidepods 'that contract like shark gills'\n\n'Taking inspiration from nature, the MCLE features sidepods that expand and contract like the gills of a great white shark,' McLaren added.\n\n'They turn it into a 500 km/h bullet on the straights, but expand as the car enters braking zones and corners to provide stability and control.'\n\nArtificial Intelligence is likely to prove one of the biggest advancements in the sport moving forward with on-board assistance potentially making radio communications with engineers redundant.\n\nThe statement continues: 'Drivers may be connected to AI via a symbiotic link in the helmet and sensors within the race suit. The AI learns and predicts the driver's preferences and state-of-mind.\n\n'It provides real-time race strategy and key information via a holographic head-up display \u2013 but more than that \u2013 it understands the driver's mood and emotional state, tailoring advice based on the physiological and psychological feedback it receives.'\n\nHow drivers receives instructions from AI is a fascinating discussion with talk they could be linked through the crash helmet\n\n'In the future we could get to the point where human ingenuity is replaced with an AI algorithm,' explains Karl Surmacz, Head of Modelling and Decision Science at McLaren Applied Technologies.\n\n'Machine learning would see human preferences and decisions, as well as our domain expertise and instinct, captured.\n\n'Take enough examples of our creative processes and outcomes, and this could be codified into an algorithm which would enable AI to make creative decisions consistent with those of a human counterpart.'\n\nWith plans in the UK to have UK all new cars with 'effectively zero-emission' by 2040, this makes up a key part of the latest designs, too.\n\nTracks are another area of constant discussion with new countries pitching all the time to bring F1 to their nation.\n\nTransparent roofs and adaptable race tracks depending on conditions are just two of the suggestions that have emerged from McLaren's findings.", "description": "McLaren have given Formula One fans their take on what the future of the sport looks like as they presented the 2050: the MCLExtreme, a futuristic race car built and designed for the future.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/23/14/8890004-0-image-a-46_1548254892293.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-23"}
