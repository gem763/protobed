Trysta Krick reacts to all the biggest games and moments from a wild weekend in the NFL. USA TODAY\n\nReplacing a Gruden isn't anything Bill Callahan hasn't done before.\n\nThe Washington Redskins interim head coach, who took over for the fired Jay Gruden early Monday, became an NFL head coach for the first time in 2002, when he replaced Jon Gruden with the Oakland Raiders. Their teams met in the Super Bowl later that season, with Gruden's Tampa Bay Buccaneers throttling his old team.\n\nAmid an 0-5 start, Callahan and the 2019 Redskins certainly don't have Super Bowl aspirations. They'll simply be looking to try and win some games and develop a core that includes rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins, their 15th overall pick from the past draft.\n\nHere are some things to know about Callahan as he pilots the Redskins for the final 11 games this season.\n\nO-line roots\n\nCallahan's first coaching gig lasted six years at Illinois, where he coached a variety of position groups. He spent two seasons as the offensive line coach at Northern Arizona and earned his first coordinator gig at Southern Illinois in 1989.\n\nHe made the jump back to the Big Ten by leading Wisconsin's offensive line unit for five seasons and departed in 1995 to be the Philadelphia Eagles' offensive line coach, his first NFL job.\n\nWashington Redskins offensive line coach Bill Callahan walks onto the field with Redskins offensive tackle Timon Parris (61) prior to practice on day one of training camp at Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center.

Despite leading the Raiders to an AFC title in his first year, Oakland owner Al Davis moved on following a 4-12 campaign the next year.\n\nNebraska Cornhuskers\n\nCallahan jumped back into the college ranks and was hired as the head coach at Nebraska prior to the 2004 season. The Cornhuskers finished inside the top 25 after his second season in Lincoln and the team won the Big 12 North the next year but couldn't sustain the winning.\n\nNebraska finished 5-7 in 2007 and Callahan was let go.\n\nBack to the NFL\n\nThe New York Jets snatched up Callahan following his ouster at Nebraska, and he helped lead an offensive-line unit that included Nick Mangold and D'Brickashaw Ferguson for four seasons.\n\nHe then spent three years in the same role with the Dallas Cowboys, including a one-year stint as the play-caller in 2013, although he was stripped of that role following the season.\n\nOnce his contract expired with Dallas, Jay Gruden hired him in Washington in January 2015. Two years later, \"assistant head coach\" was added to his title.\n\nNow, he's the interim.", "description": "The Washington Redskins fired Jay Gruden on Monday.
