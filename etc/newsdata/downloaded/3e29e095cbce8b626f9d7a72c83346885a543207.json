Yet, three years after his election, no real improvement has materialized and, if anything, they have deteriorated. Why?\n\nOne reason is that those who seek to repair the damage caused by a thirty-year deterioration in trust and cooperation face an uphill battle against what recently has been given the colloquial name, \u201cthe Blob.\u201d The term, coined by Obama White House staffer Ben Rhodes, refers to the foreign-policy establishment, mostly located in Washington, DC and constantly focused on the putative decline of American influence abroad. It has been distinguished by its unwillingness, or inability, to reconsider or reprioritize national interests that were first defined after World War II, and then continued, by and large, on auto-pilot after the end of the Cold War. Now Trump is taking a wrecking ball to this world order. But a self-anointed mandarin class or, if you prefer, deep state, that has largely operated unmolested until the advent of Trump now appears to believe that it can foil, or even subvert, the policies of a president it deems unfit for office, a development that should worry Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nAnother reason is that Trump himself has been largely indifferent to who assumes positions in his administration, calculating that by sheer force of will he, and he alone, can be the decider. In September, Trump referred to his search for a fresh national security adviser in the following terms: \u201cIt's great because it\u2019s a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump, and it\u2019s very easy, actually, to work with me. You know why it\u2019s easy? Because I make all the decisions. They don't have to work.\u201d This insouciant approach has now boomeranged on Trump.\n\nEnter William B. Taylor, Jr. Taylor has been the U.S. Charg\u00e9 d 'Affaires Ukraine since June of this year (having previously held the position of ambassador 2006\u20132009), and yesterday he testified behind-closed-doors as part of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taylor, as his testimony made clear, was able to observe first-hand many of the Trump administration\u2019s ham-fisted moves to extract, in one form another, concessions from Ukraine. But however clumsy and counterproductive Trump\u2019s moves may have been, Taylor offered an overly simplistic survey of events in the region. Indeed, his Manichean introductory and concluding remarks suggested that he views Russia as an inveterate enemy of America and Ukraine as a white knight.\n\nIn his opening statement, Taylor emphasized that Ukraine is a strategic partner of the United States that is \u201cimportant for the security of our country as well as Europe,\u201d as well as a country that is \u201cunder armed attack from Russia.\u201d Well, yes. But this sweeping description occludes more than it reveals. Foreign policy is rarely a morality play and the fairy-tale that Taylor presented was more redolent of a post\u2013Cold War cold warrior who, like too many of his colleagues at the foreign desk, are committed to retrograde thinking, than of an official offering an incisive look at a complex and troubled region. It is not as though Ukraine, where Taylor served as ambassador during the George W. Bush administration, has ever been free from the plague of corruption or murky machinations by local competing factions. Reflexively taking the side of Ukraine does not serve American interests any more than trying to pummel it for political favors. The testimony of Taylor and other State Department witnesses before the House Intelligence Committee is a case in point.\n\n\u201cThe four U.S. diplomats [Taylor, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, former special representative Kurt Volker, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George P. Kent] are all wedded to a policy maximally supportive of Ukraine's \u2018Revolution of Dignity\u2019 and all that implies. That is the policy we arrived at in the previous administration, for better or worse, and it continues to be the \u2018official\u2019 policy given strong bipartisan support in Congress,\u201d explains John Marshall Evans, a retired U.S. Foreign Service Officer who previously served as ambassador to Armenia. Evans adds that Taylor \u201cdid a great job running the assistance programs for the former USSR. Everyone respected him highly, and liked him.\u201d\n\nThe narrative in the lengthy opening statement by Taylor, however, tends to obfuscate the reality of the turmoil in Ukraine, where street protests in 2014, at least partially cheered on by the Obama administration, most notably Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, toppled the democratically elected government of President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia responded swiftly by annexing the Crimean Peninsula, where a military base has been located for decades.\n\nTaylor emphasized that in the aftermath of these dramatic events, he favored the sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine, which the Obama administration demurred on. President Barack Obama was cautious about committing to Ukraine\u2014and the visible presence of neo-Nazi, white supremacist militias did not help.\n\nDuring his testimony, Taylor recounted that on a visit to eastern Ukraine, \u201cAmbassador Volker and I could see the armed and hostile Russian-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge across the line of contact. Over 13,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the war, one or two a week. More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance.\u201d What goes unmentioned is that many of the dead are Eastern Ukrainians with deep language and cultural connections to Russia, who acted upon secessionist impulses only after the emergence of the new regime in Kiev.\n\nA New York Times article yesterday described Taylor as a \u201cmodel diplomat,\u201d and used favorable quotes only from those associated from the same doctrinaire foreign-policy establishment. Even the phrase \u201cmodel diplomat\u201d was provided by Strobe Talbott, President Bill Clinton\u2019s deputy secretary of state (and former roommate at Oxford) who was the architect of the post\u2013Cold War NATO expansion which kickstarted the trend of souring relations with Russia.\n\nThe New York Times also published, in the fall of 2018, an anonymous op-ed from a \u201csenior official in the Trump administration\u201d who wrote that he and others were \u201cworking diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations,\u201d with the premier example given as Russian-American relations. Now this figure, who apparently remains ensconced in the Trump administration that he or she so reviles, is about to publish a \u201ctell all\u201d book about the administration next month, still anonymously.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump obviously wants better relations with Moscow, but Ukraine is an obstacle to that, and he has the entire Blob against him. It is not a crime to advocate for a change of policy, or, if one is president, to change the policy, but Trump probably hasn't a clue how to do that correctly, so he sought to work around the existing structures, which must frustrate him,\u201d Evans observes.\n\nOthers take an outright critical view of Taylor and Co. \u201cTaylor\u2019s testimony shows he believes that the constitutionally elected head of the executive branch is supposed to serve unelected officials like himself. He personifies what Obama administration officials characterized as \u2018the blob,\u2019\u201d says Daniel McCarthy, a columnist for SpectatorUSA.\n\nWill anything change now that the fight between Trump and the permanent bureaucracy is now in the open? On Tuesday night, Vice President Mike Pence told Laura Ingraham, host of Fox\u2019s The Ingraham Angle, \u201cThere is no question when President Trump said we were going to drain the swamp, but an awful lot of the swamp has been caught up in the State Department bureaucracy and we\u2019re just going to keep fighting it. And we are going to fight it with the truth.\u201d For his part, Evans thinks that there is a modicum of hope for improved relations with Moscow. \u201cTaylor will have to resign now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe might even see a moderation of the uncritical support for Ukraine, as some of the ugly underside starts to emerge, although anti-Russian sentiment is the mother's milk of Congress.\u201d\n\nHunter DeRensis is a reporter at the National Interest.\n\nImage: Reuters", "description": "As William Taylor\u2019s testimony about Ukraine creates shock waves in Washington, a self-anointed mandarin class or, if you prefer, deep state, that has largely operated unmolested until the advent of Trump now appears to believe that it can foil, or even subvert, the policies of a president it deems unfit for office, a development that should worry Democrats and Republicans", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/RTS2O2GO%20%283%29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
