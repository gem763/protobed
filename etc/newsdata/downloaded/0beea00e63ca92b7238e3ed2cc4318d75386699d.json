Mitt Romney, R-Utah, would take a stand against President Trump should the impeachment inquiry advance to the second chamber of Congress for a vote.\n\nGingrich, who competed against Romney in 2012 for the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination, said on Fox News\u2019 The Ingraham Angle that Romney doesn\u2019t have much influence in the Senate given he represents \u201cthe old order,\u201d or pre-Trump era, of the GOP.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH RESPONDS TO HILLARY CLINTON SLAMMING HIS 'PARTISAN' '90S IMPEACHMENT PUSH\n\n\u201cThe truth is I don\u2019t pay attention to Mitt Romney. I don\u2019t think Mitt Romney matters in the long run of American political history,\u201d Gingrich told Fox News Host Laura Ingraham. \u201cHe certainly does not matter in a Donald Trump Republican Party. I think he is a fossilized element of a party that is disappearing.\u201d\n\nGingrich made the remarks in reaction to a piece published in The Atlantic Sunday titled \u201cThe Liberation of Mitt Romney.\u201d The story detailed how the seasoned Utah senator now considers himself free of party constraints and instead, if necessary to secure his legacy, would consider a vote in favor of impeaching Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Mitt\u2019s been in jail so I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s being liberated from,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cIn the end I have a hunch that Romney will be careful about all this, and I\u2019d be a little surprised if he didn\u2019t in the end vote against conviction if in fact it does come to the Senate.\u201d\n\n\n\nIngraham also pointed to Romney\u2019s recent address on the Senate floor rebuking the United States\u2019 intervention, or lack thereof, in the conflict in Syria. Romney, who once sought to become Secretary of State, said \u201cWhat we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain on the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nGingrich said that remark was a \u201cfairly ignorant comment about Turkey. Turkey is a fairly large country with a fairly large military. Our major airbase in the region is in Turkey. Anybody who\u2019s suggesting that you can just shrug off Turkey doesn\u2019t understand anything about the power structure of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nGingrich wrapped his appearance by comparing football to recent \"fumbles\" made by White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2014first in a press briefing and then in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace\u2014about whether Trump\u2019s notorious call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky proved quid pro quo.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cLast week for the first time in the 100 year history of the Packers, Aaron Rogers had a perfect game. There\u2019s a lot to learn from not throwing interceptions and not fumbling,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cAnd, I think the White House could slow down a little bit and give us a couple weeks of error free ball.\u201d", "description": "Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on Monday seemed to downplay a recent report that unlike other Senate Republicans, Sen.
