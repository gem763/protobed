Start With the Tutu", "language": "en", "text": "This fall, Tatyana will be training dancers from the Faubourg Theater Ballet Arts Academy, a small but notable school in Hanover Park, Ill., for an international competition. Each dancer will perform two to three ballet variations, requiring a different costume for each. I asked Michele Welsh, whose daughter Elisabeth is one of Tatyana\u2019s students, if she notices a change in Elizabeth\u2019s dancing when she practices with a tutu, \u201cIt makes all the difference,\u201d she says, \u201cshe becomes the character.\u201d\n\nOn the day I visit, Tatyana\u2019s students are giddy with excitement. They gasp as she brings out each piece. \u201cThis one is my favorite!\u201d says Julianne Pankau. Only to change her mind once Tatyana brings out another.\n\nThough it had been more than a decade since I had danced with Tatyana, her students\u2019 enthusiasm reminded me of the feeling that the \u201cRaymonda\u201d tutu gave me. I was proud to wear that blue dress \u2014 a privilege I had earned only after dedicating years to ballet.\n\nI wondered if Tatyana\u2019s current students also recognized how rare it was to be outfitted in costumes like these. One student, Michelle Zhang, put on a traditional folk dance costume. \u201cI feel like one of those Russian dolls,\u201d she said. \u201cThis looks exactly like one.\u201d", "description": "A  trove of lush Soviet-era tutus can be found hidden in the back room of a small school near Chicago.", "authors": ["Bianca Ladipo", "Whitten Sabbatini", "Written By", "Photographs By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/arts/06surfacing-tutus19/06surfacing-tutus19-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
