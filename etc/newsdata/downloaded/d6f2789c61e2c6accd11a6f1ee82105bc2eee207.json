She has been in detention in Tehran for a year.\n\nMoore-Gilbert\u2019s case was complex, Payne said.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing our discussions with the Iranian government,\u201d she added. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept the charges upon which she was convicted and we will seek to have her returned to Australia.\u201d\n\nIn September, Iran\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency quoted a judiciary spokesman as saying the three Australians had been detained for spying.\n\nFirkin and King said they would not comment further on their detention.\n\n\u201cWe know there are others who remain in detention in Iran, including a fellow Australian, and believe intense media coverage may not be helpful for efforts to bring them home,\u201d they said.", "description": "An Australian couple who spent more than three months in a prison in Tehran has been freed, Australia's foreign minister said on Saturday, and an Iranian news agency later reported that an Iranian student was released from detention in Australia.", "authors": ["Lidia Kelly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
