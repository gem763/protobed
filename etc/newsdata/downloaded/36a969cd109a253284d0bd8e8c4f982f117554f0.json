(AP) - A Kansas man is blaming CVS Pharmacy for his stroke, and he says in a lawsuit that the pharmacy filled his prescription for a blood thinning medication with the wrong drug.\n\nThe Wichita Eagle reports that Ben Huie said in his lawsuit he suffered a stroke in July 2017 after taking the wrong medicine. Kansas CVS Pharmacy said in a formal response it didn\u2019t provide the incorrect medicine or cause the stroke.\n\nHuie says taking the incorrect medicine lowered the level of warfarin sodium in his system, which contributed to the stroke. That medicine is an anticoagulant used to treat and prevent blood clots.\n\nHuie had filled his warfarin prescription at its store for several years without problems. Kansas CVS says Huie\u2019s existing medical conditions contributed to the stroke.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Wichita (Kan.)
