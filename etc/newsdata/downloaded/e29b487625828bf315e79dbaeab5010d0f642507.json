She hadn\u2019t ventured near the protests that have rocked the city.\n\nApproaching the mainland border point last month, the 21-year-old was pulled aside along with several others. Officers combed her phone, discovering Facebook and its Messenger app, both banned in China. She said her entry permit \u2014 a card used by mainland Chinese to travel to and from Hong Kong \u2014 was briefly confiscated while officers questioned her and accused her of deleting messages to hide unspecified evidence.\n\n\u201cI was shocked that they would do that without reason,\u201d said Bella, who gave only her first name for fear of reprisal, explaining that she had downloaded Facebook to follow fan pages of her musical idol, David Bowie. \u201cI kept trying to explain, but the officers wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n\nAs protests in Hong Kong have intensified into a rebellion against the Chinese state and its increasing grip over the former British colony, Beijing has grown anxious about any kind of spillover to the mainland.\n\nChinese officials are trying to solidify an ideological iron curtain between Hong Kong and mainland China \u2014 tracking people who go back and forth, ratcheting up propaganda, and intimidating protest sympathizers \u2014 to ring-fence the mainland from protesters\u2019 pro-autonomy viewpoints.\n\nThis campaign is playing out at border crossings, in cyberspace and on college campuses as far afield as Australia and the United States.\n\nThe Washington Post spoke to almost a dozen Chinese students and young professionals who have been stopped and searched at the border. Others on the mainland say they have been pressured by Chinese authorities to delete social media accounts and threatened with arrest for expressing views deemed supportive of protesters.\n\n\n\nA man holds his hands behind his head Sept. 3 on a bus at Kowloon Bay station, as police arrest people suspected of being anti-government protesters.

Yet they allowed hundreds of nationalist youths to use special software last week to vault over the firewall and flood international social networks with pro-Beijing messages.\n\nState media has at times stayed silent on major developments in Hong Kong, including the news Wednesday that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had withdrawn the contentious extradition bill that sparked the crisis.\n\nAt other times, Chinese authorities have splashed stories about the Chinese flag being hurled into the sea and promoted viral hashtags on Weibo, the country\u2019s version of Twitter, with pro-Beijing messages such as: \u201cThe five-star red flag has 1.4 billion guardians. I\u2019m one of them!\u201d\n\nThe information gap has sometimes generated confusion on Chinese social media. Some users were puzzled about why Hong Kong\u2019s stock market suddenly shot up Wednesday afternoon, when breaking news about the extradition bill\u2019s withdrawal was suppressed on the mainland. Other Chinese who had seen weeks of coverage about violent protests wondered why the government would cave to a radical fringe.\n\n\n\nPedestrians walk past a television replaying Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam\u2019s announcement of the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill on Sept. 4. (Anthony Kwan/Getty Images)\n\n'Harmful trend'\n\nSome Chinese citizens have tried to offer a different perspective, using virtual private network (VPN) software to access Facebook and Twitter and to read international news reports on the protests.\n\nByron Chen, a 34-year-old teacher at an international school, attended a July 14 rally organized by the Hong Kong Journalists Association, which advocates unfettered media access to the protests. He posted a picture on his WeChat page, stressing the legal and peaceful nature of the gathering.\n\nOne of his contacts saved the photo and distributed it with the teacher\u2019s personal details. It was soon picked up by Chinese nationalists with huge followings on Weibo. Soon, he was flooded with online messages calling for his death or imprisonment. Plainclothes officers paid him a visit, he said, and have barred him from going to Hong Kong without prior approval.\n\n\u201cI feel sympathy for the protesters, but above all, I\u2019m concerned of the rising totalitarianism and centralization of state power I see in China, which is a really harmful trend,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nChen said he has been forced to \u201cthink twice\u201d before expressing his views, especially on Chinese social media apps. Getting outed online for liberal views, he added, is \u201cnearly a death penalty\u201d in China.\n\nAndreas Fulda, the author of a book on efforts at democratization in China and a senior fellow at the University of Nottingham\u2019s Asia Research Institute, said voices like Chen\u2019s are \u201cnot being heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t think that these voices do not exist,\u201d he added.\n\nPublic figures in China who have urged their countrymen to have an open mind about the Hong Kong crisis also have been silenced. Last month, Chen Qiushi, a Beijing lawyer known for his online commentaries on social issues, told his more than 700,000 Weibo followers that he was skeptical about reports of widespread \u201crioting\u201d and traveled to Hong Kong to get a look on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t simply divide people into good or bad. People are complicated. People engage in all kinds of thinking,\u201d Chen told his audience in a live stream from Hong Kong\u2019s streets as marchers walked past in August. \u201cNot all of them are rioters.\u201d\n\nThat crossed the line. Days later, Chen\u2019s videos were removed. His family and colleagues, under pressure from authorities, urged him to quickly return to Beijing. He hasn\u2019t been able to talk publicly since, said Xu Xiaodong, a friend of Chen\u2019s who is also an outspoken social media personality.\n\nXu, a mixed martial arts fighter by trade, said his social media accounts also were shut last month after he, like Chen Qiushi, asked his followers how 2 million Hong Kongers could possibly all be labeled rioters. Days later, in late August, he was visited by authorities who asked whether he was funded by anti-Chinese foreign groups and pressured him to stop talking online.\n\n\u201cI told them I\u2019ll stop talking, but I\u2019ll continue to use VPN to get outside information for myself,\u201d Xu said in his basement gym in east Beijing. \u201cAs a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, I have a right to know about a huge incident like Hong Kong. You can\u2019t just hear one voice. When you hear only one voice, how do you know if it\u2019s real or fake?\u201d\n\n\n\nStudents take part in a school boycott rally Sept. 2 in central Hong Kong.

On Monday, the first day of the school year, Hong Kong high school students sang protest songs over the national anthem and boycotted class.\n\nMeanwhile, in mainland China, millions of youths were shown a 90-minute back-to-school special on state television.\n\nIn online forums, Chinese parents lamented that their children were assigned homework about the program, which drilled into themes of patriotism, sacrifice and the sanctity of China\u2019s flag.\n\nThe program conspicuously avoided any mention of Hong Kong, but it drove home its point with a final segment about Macao, a former Portuguese colony and semiautonomous territory that is often compared to Hong Kong.\n\nA schoolgirl from Macao sang a ballad about her people\u2019s unbreakable loyalty to China despite its colonial past:\n\n\u201cYou know \u2018Macao\u2019 was not my real family.\n\nI\u2019ve been away from you, mother.\n\nWhat they plundered was my flesh.\n\nYou still keep my soul.\u201d\n\nShih reported from Beijing.\n\nRead more\n\nHong Kong leader fully withdraws extradition bill, but protesters say it is not enough\n\nU.K. Consular official in Hong Kong disappears while returning from the mainland\n\nWill China crush Hong Kong protests?
