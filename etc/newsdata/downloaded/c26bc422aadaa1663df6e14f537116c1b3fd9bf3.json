Tickets are on sale now.\n\nThe film also stars Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid and Billy Dee Williams.\n\nThough \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d is the ninth and final chapter in the saga that started with 1977\u2032s \u201cStar Wars,\u201d Disney plans more films with new storylines. There are also several series in the works for its Disney+ streaming service.", "description": "\"The Rise of Skywalker\" opens on Dec. 20.", "authors": ["Overnight Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dae6625200000881c5065ac.jpeg?cache=m4sooz7hgx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
