Robles exited immediately and Michael A. Taylor, the on-again off-again Nationals outfielder, replaced him. Taylor provided similar defensive prowess in the outfield and at the plate, where his streaky nature has long been an issue, he went 6 for 20 (.300) and drew one walk while striking out seven times. Taylor delivered the Nationals the lead in Game 2 against the Cardinals with a solo home run to left field, which evened out when his error in the eighth inning gave St. Louis its first run of the series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe addition of Robles back to the lineup, where he\u2019s hitting eighth Monday, likely means more bunts trying for base hits a la Adam Eaton. It also could mean the Nationals try to steal an extra base, though they\u2019ve been hesitant to this series because of how well the Cardinals defend against it. Robles was 28 for 37 on steal attempts this season.\n\nMore than anything, though, it signals a more potent bat at the bottom of the order and increases the chances the Nationals flip over the lineup. The Nationals will need to do that because, though they\u2019ve won the first two games of this series, it\u2019s been because of pitching. The offense is still looking for a spark. Perhaps Robles could be it.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The Nationals center fielder had been out since Game 2 of the NLDS with a mild right hamstring strain.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/smRBWYO5XNwsWDEaopSs0U87PVc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5RSQ4BHOW4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
