I\u2019d like to invite you to be our special guest at our game this Sunday vs. the Panthers,\u201d Watson tweeted.\n\nJayden plays football for Aldine High School in Texas and received national attention when he saved a woman and her child trapped in an SUV from floodwaters last week as torrential rain hit the region. Jayden jumped into the waters without thinking to help the mother and the toddler.\n\nWASHINGTON REDSKINS SPELL LONDON FLETCHER'S NAME WRONG AS THEY INDUCT HIM INTO RING OF HONOR\n\n\u201cI hurried up, threw my jacket off, I threw my shirt off,\u201d he told the Houston Chronicle. \u201cI ran over there across in front of all the cars. I didn't care if all the cars stopped or not because I was more worried about their safety than my safety.\u201d\n\nThe three were reunited Friday. Vinitta Williams, the woman Jayden rescued, told KHOU-TV that she was trying to get her daughter home from day care when the roads began to flood. She said she felt like she was going to die as the floodwaters carried her vehicle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when he dived in and he pulled us out, and I\u2019m thinking, thank you God. He is my guardian angel. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Williams said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe added: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for him. If he wouldn't\u2019ve jumped in that water and pulled us out, we would not be here.\u201d", "description": "Houston Texans star Deshaun Watson on Monday invited a teen who helped save a woman and a child trapped in floodwaters caused by Tropical Storm Imelda to an upcoming game.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
