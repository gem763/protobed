The big forwards are pounding away in the set pieces and at the breakdowns. Tactical kicking is a key part of the arsenal, along with taking penalty goals at every opportunity. The backline concentrates on the percentage plays, and the defense is holding firm.\n\nSouth Africa advanced to the semifinals for the fifth time in seven World Cups with a 26-3 win over Japan last Sunday, scoring 21 unanswered points in the second half to avenge the shocking defeat to Japan in the so-called Miracle of Brighton four years ago.\n\nJapan had topped Pool A with wins over Ireland and Scotland, had unprecedented support at home and had quickly become the sentimental favorites for rugby fans around the world.\n\nBut the Springboks weathered all that at Tokyo Stadium, despite conceding 70% percent of the possession and territory in the first half, and eventually nullified Japan\u2019s hyper-energy, spread-the-ball wide game plan with a brutal, straight forward game.\n\nA driving maul from almost halfway set scrumhalf Faf de Klerk en route to a try in the 66th minute that ended any chance of a comeback by Japan.\n\nIt was vintage Springboks rugby, helped by having an eight-man reserves bench stacked with six forwards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we go out there with a blunt plan and hammer away, but we have a specific plan,\u201d Proudfoot said when asked if the Springboks would load up on the heavy armory again against Wales. \u201cI am very happy with the way the guys have handled those challenges.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa had only lost one test to Wales in 108 years before a 12-6 defeat at Cardiff in November 2014.\n\nThe Springboks rebounded from that with a quarterfinal win over the Welsh at the 2015 World Cup, but have lost all four meetings since then.\n\nProudfoot said there\u2019d been a different mentality since Rassie Erasmus joined as director of coaching last year.\n\nThe South Africans won the Rugby Championship, including a 16-16 draw against the All Blacks in Wellington, and hadn\u2019t lost a game in 2019 until a 23-13 loss to New Zealand in the Pool B opener.\n\nAfter conceding two tries in four minutes in an otherwise tight encounter with the All Blacks, the Springboks have only conceded one try in four games.\n\n\u201cRassie has come on board with a very specific plan - to play to the South African strengths,\u201d Proudfoot said. \u201cWhen you get alignment in the team, and everyone understands the plan and their roles, you can be very powerful.\n\n\u201cThat has been the big change - the mindset that Rassie has created throughout the group, to empower everybody to take ownership of their roles, and to play the South African way.\u201d\n\nWales won the Six Nations Grand Slam with its brand of low-risk rugby, and topped its pool after holding off a resurgent Australia in the group stage.\n\nBut the Welsh were far from convincing in a 20-19 comeback win over France, which played with typical flamboyance but lost traction after being reduced to 14 men when lock Sebastian Vahaamahina was red carded.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have played poorly,\u201d Proudfoot said. \u201cFrance are an unbelievable rugby side -did you see how they played? I don\u2019t know if anybody could have stopped them on that day.\n\n\u201cWales play to their plan so well. France had to risk it, and they did, but Wales still won.\u201d\n\nWales has never reached a World Cup final, while the Springboks have won both times they\u2019ve reached the championship match - in 1995 and 2007.\n\nThe winner in Yokohama on Sunday gets a shot at the title against New Zealand or England on Nov. 2.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After finishing off the home team's remarkable run at the Rugby World Cup in the quarterfinals, the Springboks are feeling more comfortable about taking on Wales in Japan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
