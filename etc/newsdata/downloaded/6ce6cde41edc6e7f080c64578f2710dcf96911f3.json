There is a lot of competition. I hope Sancho confirms his good year, but there would be little room for him in the Bayern squad.\"\n\nGnabry has arguably done more than anyone to fill the void left by Ribery so far after he excelled with a remarkable four-goal haul in the 7-2 Champions League demolition of Tottenham last week.\n\n\"Serge is still young, but he has character, personality,\" Ribery said. \"He plays without fear.\"\n\n\"After his four goals against Tottenham, more is expected, but Serge is a man, not a machine.\n\n\"It's not easy to show top performances in every game, but Serge will continue on his way without putting too much pressure [on himself].\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRibery also feels the burgeoning alliance between star striker Lewandowski and on-loan Barcelona playmaker Coutinho will continue to yield handsome returns.\n\n\"Bayern can now play different variations and Coutinho is good for Robert Lewandowski,\" he added.\n\n\"He always wants the ball; Coutinho takes responsibility and serves his team-mates - either the outside striker or just Lewy, who receives great passes.\"\n\nFCB currently lie third in the Bundesliga, with a couple of defeats in seven matches having put Niko Kovac's side under early pressure.", "description": "The former FCB star says that the Bundesliga champions would be wasting their energy chasing the England star as they have plenty of wide talent", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uC3Osalckg06Jt.c0QXPxA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iunof6zc_3DvjsQtbSzcjA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/7507eb712dbeb7315182fc0f2d6a979c", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
