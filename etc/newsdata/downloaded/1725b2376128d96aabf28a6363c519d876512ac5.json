They\u2019re out for females and they won\u2019t leave them, won\u2019t retreat.\n\n\u2018But you don\u2019t want to mess about. We always carried around a pole, and with a pole you can arrest them, can slow them down a little.\u2019\n\nWhile filming the newest documentary series, which is released next Sunday, Sir David\u2019s film crew manage to capture some never before seen images of animal behaviour, through the use of on-the-ground camera teams, drones and underwater video footage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: David Attenborough David Attenborough finds youths' obsession with him 'odd' and we love him for it David Attenborough says humans have made a 'terrible mess' of the planet David Attenborough finally able to film monkey he\u2019s been waiting 50 years to find\n\nOne continent is explored per episode, with Asia\u2019s installment also allowing them to uncover a rare monkey Sir David has been trying to capture on film for more than 50 years.\n\nWe thought the series might be the team\u2019s best work yet \u2013 so we can\u2019t wait to see what they come up with next.\n\nSeven Worlds, One Planet airs Sunday 27 October on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
