In any other venue against any other fighter in the UK, Campbell would be an overwhelming fan-favourite, but the life-affirming ability of his Ukrainian opponent will produce a definite split in crowd support at the O2 Arena.\n\nLomachenko has already surpassed most levels of boxing just 14 fights into his professional career. An outrageously successful amateur record yielded hundreds of victories and just one defeat, with two Olympic gold medals and two world championship titles indicative of his prowess.\n\nA move to the professional ranks in October 2013 resulted in a convincing victory over Jose Ramirez, before he attempted to win a world title in just his second fight. The miracle result wasn\u2019t to be however after Orlando Salido used every dirty trick in the book to eke out a split decision win, but unperturbed, Lomachenko has dominated all who have followed since.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe likes of Gary Russell Jr, Nicholas Walters, Roman Martinez and Guillermo Rigondeaux have been made to look like nobodies, with Lomachenko\u2019s speed and skill unparalleled against genuinely quality rivals. Put simply, Lomachenko is the definition of sensational, and well worth the \u00a320 it will cost to see him against Campbell tonight. Let\u2019s be honest, most recent pay-per-view events have been pointless to purchase, but a fighter of Lomachenko\u2019s ability is well worth the outlay.\n\nThere is an aura around the man, the type you get watching super fast bowlers bowl 94mph on a rapid wicket or when you see an electric swimmer destroy the field in the pool. Lomachenko can do things in the ring others can only dream of, and every fight he has is something to cherish regardless of the opponent.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold.

Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5.

Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nSo, does Luke Campbell have a chance tonight? On paper, the 31-year-old has an outstanding resume that deserves respect. The issue is, most of that success came in the amateur ranks. A European and Olympic gold medalist, Campbell also claimed silver in the 2011 World Championships and competed at many of the same events as Lomachenko during their unpaid careers.\n\nCampbell turned professional under a blaze of publicity in 2013, but has yet to have a defining night under the bright TV lights despite his 20-2 record. There has been no British or European belts earned, and two significant defeats derailed Campbell\u2019s ascent to glory just as he looked like fulfilling his potential.\n\nA shock December 2015 loss to Yven Mendy was eventually amended last year when he beat the Frenchman in a rematch, while Campbell showed incredible guts, skill and heart to go the distance with Jorge Linares in 2017 just weeks after the death of his father. That Linares loss was Campbell\u2019s first attempt to win a world title, and he is confident that his second tilt will be a triumph despite the supremo standing in his way.\n\nAlso 31, Lomachenko is still around his prime as an athlete, with his daunting attributes now teamed with increasingly powerful punches, most notably to the body. Lomachenko rarely gets hit, but unlike some defensive fighters who grow tired of their own abilities, he still works hard to maintain a balanced attitude at all times. The Ukrainian can be hurt however, and was dropped when he fought Jorge Linares, but went on to win the fight with a stoppage of his own.\n\nPerhaps the key element of this fight will be the height difference between the two fighters. It\u2019s noticeable just how much larger Campbell is, who looks to be at least five inches taller than Lomachenko. If Campbell can utilise the height and reach difference it could impact the fight, but Lomachenko is a master of inside fighting and will relish the chance to attack Campell\u2019s body if he can break the guard.\n\nWhile height will tell a story, so too will strength. Lomachenko is the much smaller man who began his professional career as a featherweight. Campbell is a bonafide lightweight with snap in his punches and speed of his own, and if he can impose his will, it makes the night trickier for Lomachenko.\n\nThis is what makes the fight so fascinating. We know how good Lomachenko is, we\u2019ve seen it time and time again over the years. Every feint, pivot, screw-shot, jab and hook has been analysed and feted on a biblical level. Yet with Campbell, it\u2019s still unknown. We know what he can do, we\u2019ve seen the fast hands, the grit, the body shots. But we\u2019ve never seen it all put together. Campbell needs 12 rounds of pure concentration, perfect tactics and a hope that his opponent is under 90% capacity. Is that too much to ask?\n\nThe Brit has been trained by Shane McGuigan for this fight, which makes the night even more interesting. While no doubt an excellent trainer, McGuigan\u2019s fighters have failed to win the big win over the past 12 months and there are suspicions that tactically there is still work to do. Beating Lomachenko relies on a rock-solid plan. Have Campbell and McGuigan created one? They\u2019ve talked big in the build-up, but now is the time for the truth to reveal itself.\n\nValue for money is increased with an excellent undercard in London, headlined by Hughie Fury taking on former heavyweight champion Alexander Povetkin. Still just 24, Fury needs a defining win to move him forward and will see Povetkin as that opportunity. Elsewhere, Charlie Edwards defends his WBC flyweight title against Julio Cesar Martinez Aguilar, while Olympic stars Joe Cordina and Joshua Buatsi also feature.", "description": "One of the best boxers on the planet touches down in London tonight as Vasyl Lomachenko defends his three lightweight world titles against Hull\u2019s Luke Campbell.
