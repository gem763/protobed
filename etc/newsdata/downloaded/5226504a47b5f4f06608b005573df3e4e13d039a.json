The company was expected to publish the lowest prices offered by bidders, providing a valuable insight into the opaque LNG market, which is characterised by closed bilateral trades, private long-term supply agreements and an over-the-counter spot market.\n\nItaly's Eni, China's PetroChina, Azeri state oil company SOCAR and commodities trader Trafigura had placed offers into the tender, sources had told Reuters.
