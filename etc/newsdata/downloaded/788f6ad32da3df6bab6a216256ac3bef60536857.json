Those involved in the study \u2013 aged 17 to 35 \u2013 many of them university students \u2013 were experiencing depression and were eating what the study deemed unhealthy diets.\n\nHalf of the participants started eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish and lean meat, and experienced significantly lower depression symptoms after three weeks than the group which stuck with the normal diet.\n\nThe research is one of many studies that link a healthy diet to improved mental health, but this study is considered one of the most reliable yet.\n\nBefore the study, all volunteers shared information about their eating habits and mood. They all had symptoms of what is considered moderate or high levels of depression, and all ate a lot of refined carbohydrates, saturated fats and sugar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group that changed their diets for the study were shown a video detailing recommendations around healthy eating \u2013 including aspects of Mediterranean-style diets and foods that are known to be good for the brain (such as foods with omega-3, cinnamon and turmeric).\n\nThey were instructed to have a particularly high intake of fruits and vegetables \u2013 three and five servings respectively \u2013 and to cut down on refined carbohydrates, sugar, fatty or processed meats and soft drinks. To cover their costs, volunteers were each given a hamper and a weekly food budget.\n\nAfter three weeks, the group that had started eating healthily saw their levels of depression, anxiety and stress fall significantly. Those who kept eating the same did not report any changes to their mood.\n\nThe researchers wrote: \u2018These findings add to a growing literature showing a modest change to diet is a useful adjunct therapy to reduce symptoms of depression.\u2019\n\nThis research may provide some comfort to those experiencing depression who are able to alter their diet \u2013 but mental health is complicated.\n\nAll kinds of factors \u2013 including biology, poverty and experience of oppression such as racism \u2013 impact a person\u2019s likelihood to face mental health challenges.\n\nWhilst eating more healthily may improve some people\u2019s symptoms, other remedies include talking therapies, medication, and being in nature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Couple who met on \u2018affairs website\u2019 plan to marry and be faithful\n\nMORE: Straight women have \u2018more orgasms\u2019 if they\u2019re feminists\n\nMORE: Incredible foster mum teaches the black children she cares for about their heritage and culture\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A new study has found that just three weeks of healthy eating can improve depression symptoms.", "authors": ["Sophie Hemery"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89271266_1570720447.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
