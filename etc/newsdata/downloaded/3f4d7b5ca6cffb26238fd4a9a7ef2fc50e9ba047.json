REUTERS/Temilade Adelaja/File Photo\n\nABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal by the main opposition candidate to overturn the result of February\u2019s presidential election in which Muhammadu Buhari was returned to office.\n\nAtiku Abubakar lodged his initial complaint with the country\u2019s election tribunal, which ruled against him last month. Tuesday\u2019s decision is likely to end the former vice president\u2019s ambition to govern Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Atiku\u2019s appeal as \u201clacking merit\u201d, saying in a short statement it would issue a more detailed reasoning for its decision later.\n\nBuhari took 56% of the vote against 41% for Atiku, according to electoral commission data. A Buhari victory had been widely anticipated.\n\nEvery election result has been contested since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999, with the exception of the 2015 poll in which Goodluck Jonathan conceded defeat to Buhari.", "description": "Nigeria's Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal by the main opposition candidate to overturn the result of February's presidential election in which Muhammadu Buhari was returned to office.", "authors": ["Camillus Eboh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446550341&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T17F", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
