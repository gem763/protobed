Team USA don\u2019t suffer too many defeats, so each one tends to feel like a disaster. To be more specific, Wednesday\u2019s 89-78 loss to France in the quarter-finals of the Fiba World Cup was the program\u2019s first since 2006. While it came earlier in the tournament than many had predicted, nobody can claim it was completely unexpected. History, however, tells us that the Americans will be back and stronger than ever. In the meantime, let this result be another example of the health of the sport around the world.\n\nChampions USA shocked by France in Fiba World Cup quarter-finals Read more\n\nIt was obvious heading into China that this particular edition of Team USA was going to have a challenge on its hands. Star after star dropped out on the way towards the main event, leaving the Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker as the sole reigning all-NBA player on the roster. The US memorably lost to Australia in a warm-up game and they probably would have dropped their game against Turkey in the tournament\u2019s first round were in not for a series of increasingly absurd free-throw misses by their opponents late in the contest.\n\nThe 2019 squad wasn\u2019t a Dream Team, it wasn\u2019t even an All-Star Team. As great as the likes of Khris Middleton and Donovan Mitchell can be, it will be a long time before anybody mistakes them for the likes of LeBron James or Kevin Durant. It didn\u2019t help that they were a hastily thrown together collection of near-stars and solid players who didn\u2019t really get much time to get to know each other. Let\u2019s also admit that Gregg Popovich, who was coaching the national team for the first time in his glittering career, was playing under a different set of rules from those you find in the NBA. Popovich may go down as the best coach in NBA history, but there\u2019s still something of a learning curve to be expected here. This was a vulnerable group.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gregg Popovich talks to Kemba Walker and the rest of the USA team.

While they may be heading home empty-handed, the players on this World Cup squad did at least manage to clinch a spot at next year\u2019s Games. Typically, when the US embarrasses itself on the world stage, it redoubles its recruiting efforts in order to get its revenge. When Team USA merely won bronze medals in both the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Fiba World Championship, it put together the LeBron James-led Redeem Team to ensure that they would win gold in 2008. It wouldn\u2019t be shocking if stars who couldn\u2019t find time for the World Cup will suddenly rediscover their national pride next summer.\n\nThat\u2019s the open secret about the Fiba World Cup: it simply doesn\u2019t matter as much to the US as it does to other countries. There\u2019s a glory of playing in front of gigantic global audiences at the Olympics that just doesn\u2019t compare to playing 8.30am EST games that have been relegated to ESPN+. If there\u2019s one lesson to be learned from the US\u2019s flameout, it\u2019s that the other countries had more invested this time around.\n\nWhy the Toronto Raptors' title is a victory for the NBA, Canada ... and the US Read more\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world produced some really good teams for the tournament. France\u2019s victory over the US was technically an upset, but you wouldn\u2019t know that from watching a game where they dominated for the majority of the second half. Led by the NBA\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert, they showed that the US\u2019s earlier struggles against Turkey weren\u2019t just the result of an off night.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that the US brought an uninspiring roster to China, it was that other countries are getting that much better at basketball. Look at who the Americans will be facing in the consolation bracket: mighty Serbia. Many had tabbed Serbia as the best team in the field, the top favorites to unseat the US in the World Cup, but instead they lost to Argentina in the quarter-finals. Now the two countries will be playing just for positioning in the final rankings.\n\nFollowing their surprising victories, France and Argentina join Spain and Australia in the semi-finals. If you had filled out brackets for the Fiba World Cup, undoubtedly they are now busted and that\u2019s probably a good thing. For basketball to fully grow on the international stage there must be some amount of global parity and there are signs that this might be on the horizon. There is no greater indicator for the health of the sport than the fact that the favorites are out of the running and the gold medal is officially up for grabs.", "description": "The US men\u2019s basketball team crashed out of the World Cup \u2013 but it\u2019s a sign that other countries are closing the talent gap", "authors": ["Hunter Felt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1330e915798203f5bf68c632799c291ef8b5160/0_164_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cbde26e984775da812ef7251a7a2c6a0", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
