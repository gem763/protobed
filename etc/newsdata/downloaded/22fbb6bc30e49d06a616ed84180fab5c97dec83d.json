The cardboard boxes had holes cut in the front, restricting students\u2019 line of sight.\n\nPhotographs of the peculiar anti-cheating measure show students hunched over their exams, their heads obscured by re-tooled cardboard receptacles. Predictably, the photos spread across social media, catching the attention of horrified government officials.\n\nStudents \"thinking inside\" the box. Ashamed that a college in #Karnataka#India have compelled students to wear cardboard boxes to prevent cheating. Where are we heading to with education, especially with such practices on assessments in today's 21st century age. #Educationpic.twitter.com/dC7Bt0SJMI \u2014 Francis Joseph (@Francis_Joseph) October 19, 2019\n\n#Karnataka students made to wear cartons on their heads to avoid copying in exams. pic.twitter.com/FOagX0U0tz \u2014 dinesh akula (@dineshakula) October 19, 2019\n\nAfter learning about the incident, State Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said that the students had been treated \u201clike animals\u201d and that the college\u2019s \u201cperversion\u201d would be swiftly dealt with. The state government has reportedly ordered the college to immediately stop the practice.\n\nThe college\u2019s director told the Times of India that students gave their full consent to participate in the experiment, which he said aimed solely to \u201ccurb malpractice.\u201d He said, however, that his institution would comply with any directive it received from the education ministry.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Indian students have been subjected to unusual social experiments in an attempt to bolster scholarly pursuits. Earlier this week, the Uttar Pradesh instituted a blanket ban on cellphones in all colleges and universities \u2013 purportedly because pupils were being distracted by their mobile devices.\n\nAlso on rt.com Indian state bans cellphones at all colleges and universities\n\nLike this story?
