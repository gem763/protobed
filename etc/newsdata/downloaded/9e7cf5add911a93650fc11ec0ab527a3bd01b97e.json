More action is planned across the country\n\nProtesters hit the street of Melbourne in a series of planned events across the country. Events will take place throughout the week from Brisbane to Adelaide\n\nI replied to the best of my knowledge; that almost all scientists say the earth is getting hotter and this means we that we not only get more warm weather but it alters the natural balance and we are seeing more floods, fires and droughts in many parts of the world.\n\nIt could be caused by many things but that having so many people using so many things has consequences for a planet that can\u2019t grow any bigger like the global population does.\n\nSome politicians, people who make money out of the way we currently do things and a bunch of grumpy older people who don\u2019t like being told they are wrong refuse to change their ways.\n\nAn activist is arrested during an Extinction Rebellion climate protest in Melbourne\n\nBut it\u2019s also true that in Australia, we have the most comfortable lifestyle in the world and this happens in large part due to digging things out of the ground \u2013 such as coal and iron ore \u2013 and selling them to people who don\u2019t have those resources in their own country.\n\nSo we can\u2019t move too quickly or everyone will get scared or resent being told what to do. Then nothing will change.\n\nThat\u2019s why it was so frustrating to see protesters chaining themselves by their necks to barricades in the Brisbane CBD this week as part of the so-called climate rebellion.\n\nThe arrogance of interrupting the lives of everyday people to press home a political point is as short sighted as it is foolish.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t help pressure governments to act on climate action as it puts reasonable people offside, including many who might broadly agree.\n\nClimate change protestors from the Extinction Rebellion movement gather to demonstrate at Town Hall in Sydney\n\nDeliberately inflammatory language that protesters will occupy hundreds of cities all over the globe until their demands are met to stop the climate catastrophe amounts to little more than bullying.\n\nTrying to apply pressure without strategy rarely amounts to anything and it is interesting that even the protesters agree they are exercising their \u201cprivilege\u201d to participate in civil disobedience.\n\nIt\u2019s a privilege the Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton says might be severely curtailed, suggesting naming and shaming, jail time and even stopping welfare payments to protesters.\n\nPainting climate protesters as layabouts, criminals and welfare cheats serves a political purpose because it pushes them and to some extent their ideas, to the fringes of the debate.\n\nPolice officers drag activists from Extinction Rebellion out of the road in Elizabeth Street as they attempted to block traffic during a protest in Sydney\n\nLooking like the sensible grown-up in an argument means you can occupy the middle ground. That\u2019s where a majority of public opinion sits and elections are won.\n\nThere are certainly a number of climate deniers in the Morrison Government but there are many, many more that will be happy to ride the politics to the line.\n\nThat\u2019s why Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s response to teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s speech at the United Nations as subjecting Australian children to \u201cneedless anxiety\u201d was clever.\n\nWhile the Prime Minister says he wants to give wants to give Australian children confidence they will have an \u201ceconomy to live in\u201d, the kids themselves are entirely justified in arguing that they need confidence there will be a planet to live on.\n\nYou can also expect Labor to sit in the centre on this issue, with Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese supporting new legislation to stop animal rights activists targeting farms, warning vegan terrorists are not a Labor constituency.\n\nThe climate wars won\u2019t be ending anytime soon but one thing I can say is this: Barricading yourself on city streets for climate action will do nothing but give an advantage to your opponents. Even a six-year-old can tell you that.", "description": "Darrin Barnett, who has worked within the Australian political sphere, says he wouldn't oppose his children attending peaceful climate rallies.
