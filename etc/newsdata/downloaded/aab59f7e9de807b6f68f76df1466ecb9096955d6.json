A Higher Loyalty takes its title from what Comey says Trump demanded of him during the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nPublished in April 2018, A Higher Loyalty was an instant bestseller, moving more than 600,000 copies in its first week. The book covers Comey's 2013-17 tenure as FBI director, his role in the 2016 election \u2014 both in the investigation of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and in Russian interference with the election \u2014 and his relationship with President Trump, who fired Comey in May 2017.\n\nBilly Ray (Shattered Glass, Captain Phillips) adapted the book and will direct the miniseries, which is scheduled to go into production in November. A premiere date hasn't been set; CBS executives also have yet to decide whether the project will air on Showtime, CBS All Access or potentially both.\n\n\"Jeff is so perfect for this part: great actor, instant integrity, loads of warmth, intelligence, complexity and gravitas,\" said Ray. \"We talked backstage after I saw him in To Kill a Mockingbird on Broadway, and I knew I was looking at the only person who could play Jim Comey. Lucky for me, he said yes.\"\n\nOf Gleeson, Ray said, \"It\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger acting challenge than playing Donald Trump. You have to have presence, and a singular kind of dynamism. You also have to have the courage and the will to play Trump\u2019s psychology from the inside out. Oh, and you have to be spectacularly talented and watchable. Not many actors check all those boxes. Brendan does. I\u2019m ecstatic about this.\"\n\nDaniels, a two-time Emmy winner, is wrapping his starring run as Atticus Finch in Aaron Sorkin's adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird on Nov. 3 (Ed Harris will take over the role after that). He starred in Hulu's limited series The Looming Tower in 2018 and is set to star in Showtime drama Rust.\n\nRay, who spent a year researching the Comey miniseries, executive produces with Alex Kurtzman, Shane Salerno and Heather Kadin. The project comes from Kurtzman's Secret Hideout, The Story Factory and Home Run Productions in association with CBS TV Studios.\n\nDaniels is repped by ICM and Martino Management. Gleeson is repped by The Agency in Ireland and Principal Entertainment.", "description": "Jeff Daniels and Brendan Gleeson will star as former FBI director James Comey and Donald Trump in a miniseries from CBS TV Studios.", "authors": ["Rick Porter", "Rick.Porter Thr.Com"], "top_image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2019/10/jeff_daniels-james_comey-brendan_gleeson-donald_trump_-_getty_-_split_-_h_2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
