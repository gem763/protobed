Larry Rasky, a lobbyist who previously worked as a top campaign operative for Biden, is listed as the treasurer of the PAC, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). \u201cA former Joe Biden aide has filed paperwork to form a super PAC, called Unite the Country, that is set to boost the former vice president with millions of dollars in spending in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary,\u201d Politico reported on Tuesday. Records filed with the Department of Justice show that Rasky is also a registered foreign agent lobbying on behalf of the government of Azerbaijan. The records, which were filed pursuant to the Foreign Agent Registration Act, show that Rasky was hired by the Azerbaijani government on April 23, 2019. Federal documents signed by Rasky show that he reports directly to Elin Suleymanov, Azerbaijan\u2019s ambassador to the United States. \u2026 Azerbaijan is not the only foreign entity that Rasky has recently represented. He and his firm also lobbied on behalf of a Bangladeshi political party through January of 2019.\n\nRasky reportedly earns $15,000 per month for his services, Davis notes.\n\nSuper PACs are independent political action committees that Democrats have criticized because they allow unlimited donations, though their contact with campaigns is restricted. Biden was forced to accept super PAC spending last week because of fundraising woes as he struggles to keep up with his rivals. Politico reported that the super PAC came at a crucial time for Biden, giving his campaign \u201cmore certainty that it will have the resources to move forward.\u201d The Politico article identified Rasky as \u201ca longtime Biden friend who worked on Biden\u2019s 1988 and 2008 presidential bids.\u201d It did not delve into Rasky\u2019s service as an agent for the Azerbaijani government.\n\nBiden broke an earlier pledge not to use a super PAC. After doing so, he encountered harsh criticism from fellow Democrats and the media. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) emailed supporters, noting that \u201cJoe Biden went back on his no super PACs pledge and decided to encourage billionaires to form a super PAC to bankroll his campaign.\u201d CNN\u2019s John King noted that Biden had lied about not changing his position on super PAC money.\n\nThe revelation that Biden\u2019s super PAC is run by a foreign agent also bolsters concerns raised by Republicans about the former vice president allegedly using his office to sell influence, as his son Hunter enjoyed lucrative business ties in Ukraine, China, and elsewhere, seemingly without any other notably business qualifications or experience.\n\nJoel B.
