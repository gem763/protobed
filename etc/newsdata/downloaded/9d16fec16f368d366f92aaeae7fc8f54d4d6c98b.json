It managed to bring the numbers up by launching a social media campaign, urging both locals and tourists to support the dolphins and help save a local company. \u201cWe\u2019ve had amazing support from different parts of the community. Right now, it\u2019s keeping us going,\u201d said Walker. \u201cIf the downturn in tourism continues, we\u2019ll struggle through.\u201d\n\nJanet Walker, Media spokesperson and Senior Tour Conductor of Hong Kong Dolphinwatch Ltd., at her office in Tsim Sha Tsui.

There were 188 in 2003.\n\nThe drop in visitor arrivals in August was the biggest year-on-year monthly decline for Hong Kong since 2003, when an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) left 299 people in the city dead.\n\nThe number of pink dolphins spotted in Hong Kong has drastically dropped over the years.

You can go shopping and dining in pretty much any big city, but who else has pink dolphins?\u201d", "description": "Many businesses are losing money as travel to the city declines, especially tour companies that rely on visitors", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/d8b533bc-eca4-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires082906.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
