The 23-year-old has been nominated for an Oscar, but he\u2019s never done stunts, worked with swords or played a role quite like this. And not many people his age have.\n\nThe film is drawn from Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry V\u201d as well as \u201cHenry IV\u201d parts one and two. Co-writer and co-star Joel Edgerton, who plays Falstaff, had had a formative experience doing the plays. But they\u2019d often cast older actors who had the perceived gravitas and experience for the part.\n\n\u201cThere was a real aversion to using younger actors for these roles,\u201d Chalamet said. \u201cAt the time power was wielded by unusually young people\u2026That felt new and unique to explore.\u201d\n\nHe said there is something \u201cdisturbed\u201d about young people having so much power.\n\nThe film follows young Henry, or Hal, from his drunken days in Eastcheap to his early days as King of England, a position he never wanted and takes reluctantly when his father, Henry IV (Ben Mendelsohn), dies.\n\nDavid Mich\u00f4d (\u201cWar Machine\u201d) co-wrote the script with Edgerton and co-wrote the movie even though he never saw himself doing a \u201cswords and horses\u201d epic. But he was intrigued to put his own spin on the plays, adding things from history and making up, \u201cA whole bunch of stuff.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Robert Pattinson playing a dandy version of the Dauphin - the son of King Charles of France - and whether or not that was rooted in history, Mich\u00f4d said, \u201cI honestly can\u2019t remember what\u2019s real, what\u2019s made up and what\u2019s from Shakespeare.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, having worked with Pattinson before on \u201cThe Rover,\u201d that it was \u201cimportant to me that when he appeared in the movie, he does so with razzle-dazzle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe King\u201d is playing out of competition at Venice and is one of three Netflix films, including \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d and \u201cMarriage Story\u201d making their debut on the Lido. It will open in theaters Oct. 11, before hitting Netflix on Nov. 1.\n\nChalamet, meanwhile, also has \u201cLittle Women\u201d coming to theaters this Christmas, reuniting him with his \u201cLady Bird\u201d director Greta Gerwig.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really trying to just do great projects and things that are challenging,\u201d Chalamet said. \u201cI feel I\u2019m really still learning and trying to chase whatever best version of an actor I can be.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Timothee Chalamet is already one of the most acclaimed young actors working today, but he says that the prospect of playing young Henry V in \"The King\" was terrifying.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Lindsey Bahr"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/italy_venice_film_festival_2019_the_king_photo_call_50875_c0-0-4577-2668_s1770x1032.jpg?271e343f24c20e4c5e3c9ebe4efecbd991d0d920"}
