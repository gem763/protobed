You can form your own view.

I didn\u2019t know that there was a word for it, but yeah, I was really enjoying that segment,\u201d the Academy Award-winning artist said.\n\n\u201cWe were all arguing back in the dressing room with a couple of your producers. Yes, I feel like I identify as sapiosexual,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSapiosexual\u201d is a term used to describe an individual who is \u201csexually attracted to highly intelligent people\u201d, Merriam-Webster explains.\n\n\u201cThis term is showing up with increasing frequency in personal ads, advice columns, and even on T-shirts used by those who choose to describe themselves and their romantic interests in a way that contrasts sharply with the often superficial, looks-oriented criteria traditionally associated with the beginnings of romance,\u201d the dictionary states.\n\nPrior to Ronson\u2019s interview on Good Morning Britain, the talk show conducted a debate regarding sapiosexuality.\n\nSociologist Dr Catherine Hakim argued that a person\u2019s appearance is always an initial factor when it comes to sexual attraction.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

So that\u2019s how I identify,\u201d Hodgson said.\n\nEarlier this year, Ronson won an Oscar for co-writing the song \u201cShallow\u201d for the 2018 remake of musical drama A Star Is Born, alongside Lady Gaga, Andrew Wyatt and Anthony Rossomando.\n\nTo read The Independent\u2019s review of Ronson\u2019s album Late Night Feelings, click here.\n\nThe Independent's Millennial Love group is the best place to discuss to the highs and lows of modern dating and relationships.
