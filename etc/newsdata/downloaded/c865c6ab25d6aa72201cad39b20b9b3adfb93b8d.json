We were taken back off the bus, and we were told, as well as the passengers, we all had to pay.\n\n\u201cWe feel completely isolated over here, no real communication at all, it\u2019s just a matter of waiting and seeing if we can get this flight home tonight or whether we\u2019ll be here for the night.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t any rooms, there\u2019s nothing put in place for us, it\u2019s just a waiting game.\u201d\n\nThe British Ambassador to Havana, Antony Stokes, had to negotiate with the Cuban authorities to ensure customers and crew were allowed to leave for the airport without paying again.\n\nMeanwhile, holidaymakers were left distraught after a hotel in Tenerife reportedly demanded they pay more than \u00a31,000 or be kicked out of their rooms.\n\nA property in the Playa de las Am\u00e9ricas resort slipped notes under guests\u2019 doors telling them to contact reception immediately, where they were presented with bills, despite having pre-paid for their package holidays.\n\nStacey Robinson, 28, was halfway through a holiday with her partner and nine month-old daughter when the company collapsed, reports Manchester Evening News.\n\nMs Robinson says she was handed a piece of paper with \u00a31,038 \u2013 the sum thought to be owed by Thomas Cook \u2013 written on it. Staff told her to pay up within two hours or risk being turfed out of the property.\n\n\u201cI was in tears as we don\u2019t have that kind of money,\u201c she said.\n\n\u201dWe are just sat waiting in our room because we are scared if we leave we will end up being locked out.\u201c\n\nOther holidaymakers appeared to be in the same position.\n\nPackage holidays are protected under the Atol scheme, meaning the CAA settles up any outstanding hotel bills rather than the guests themselves.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand that this is a hugely distressing situation for Thomas Cook passengers, people with holidays booked with Thomas Cook and Thomas Cook staff.\n\n\u201cThe government have deployed teams on the ground to support those affected, and are in contact with local authorities and hotels.\u201d", "description": "Thomas Cook holidaymakers currently stranded abroad after the company went bust this week have been told to \u201cenjoy the rest of their stay\u201d, amid increasing demands for payment from hotels.
