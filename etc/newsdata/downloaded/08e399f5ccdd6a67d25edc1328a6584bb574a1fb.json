Before that, Chicago billionaire Sam Zell said his firm has never been this cash-heavy. Meanwhile, hedge-fund titan Paul Singer has been busy raising a big chunk of change.\n\nSo, yes, market heavyweights are taking a risk-off stance by wading deeper into the relative safety of cash. They\u2019re not alone either, according to Avalon Investment\u2019s Bill Stone, who talked with CNBC about all the cash on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at about $3.4 trillion in money market assets,\u201d he explained. \u201cPut in that perspective, we got up to $3.9 trillion during the worst of the financial crisis, then it fell to about $2.6 trillion, so obviously it\u2019s been moving up.\u201d\n\nMoney-market growth in recent years has been prompted by top-heavy stocks and, until last year, rising rates that made for decent yields in U.S. Treasurys. The Fed, however, has struck a dovish chord lately and bond yields are hovering near lows, which may lure investors back into equities again.\n\n\u201cWith all that dry powder out there, the catalyst is that yield is going to start to fall away. We\u2019ve already seen yield on short term, fixed income fall,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will be looking for yield and looking for a return somewhere. And I think that\u2019s the place where if they\u2019re less concerned about a recession and the global slowdown, that could be a spot where you get money going into stocks.\u201d\n\nCNBC points out that more than half of the yields on the S&P 500 SPX, -0.84% are more than the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% .\n\nStone added that the likelihood of a recession is low, considering the strength of the consumer. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason why the U.S. economy continues to hold together, he said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t see a reason why that\u2019s going to fall apart really soon.\u201d\n\nWatch the full interview:\n\nCash is a pretty good place to be on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down DJIA, -0.53% almost 200 points.", "description": "Last week, Lim Chow Kiat, who runs some $440 billion in for Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, laid out his case for keeping powder dry.
