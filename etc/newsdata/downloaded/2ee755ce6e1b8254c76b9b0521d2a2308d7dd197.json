But other polls show Americans are more divided on whether Trump should be removed from office.\n\nIn the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, respondents were asked a series of three questions: whether they support the impeachment inquiry, whether they would support the House\u2019s impeaching Trump and then whether they would support the Senate\u2019s voting to remove him.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/0d/b3/08dda1db44dc8b035fc7a44ad869/impeachment-evolution2.png\"\n\nAt each step, voters were split sharply along partisan lines. On the inquiry, 84 percent of Democrats, 16 percent of Republicans and 45 percent of independents support it \u2014 while 12 percent of Democrats, 81 percent of Republicans and 43 percent of independents oppose it.\n\nAnd while the topline results are virtually indistinguishable on the following two questions, there is some movement among partisans. Support for the House\u2019s voting to impeach Trump ticks up among Democrats, to 88 percent from 84 percent, and down among Republicans, to 12 percent from 16 percent. Independents are divided: 44 percent would support the House\u2019s impeaching Trump, and 42 percent would oppose that.\n\nSimilarly, Democrats would support the Senate\u2019s voting to remove Trump from office, 88 percent to 7 percent. Among Republicans, only 12 percent would support Trump\u2019s removal, and 83 percent would oppose it. Roughly as many independents would support the Senate\u2019s ousting Trump (44 percent) as would oppose it (43 percent).\n\nOther polls show a larger gap between approval of the impeachment inquiry and support for Trump\u2019s removal. But those polls also have important methodological differences that shed light on the results.\n\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll released on Tuesday first asked respondents whether Congress should or should not have begun an impeachment inquiry of Trump. A majority, 58 percent, said it should have \u2014 and then they were asked whether the House should vote to remove him from office.\n\nOf the respondents who said Congress should have begun an inquiry, 86 percent said the House should impeach Trump \u2014 which netted out to 49 percent support for Trump\u2019s impeachment. With 38 percent saying Congress should not have begun an impeachment inquiry, that leaves 6 percent of respondents who think the inquiry is appropriate but don\u2019t think the House should vote to impeach Trump.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll , also released Tuesday, asked separately about the inquiry and impeachment and removal \u2014 but in reverse order. In an initial question, Quinnipiac found voters split on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office: 45 percent said yes, while 49 percent said no. But in a subsequent question, the school found that 53 percent of voters approve of Congress\u2019 \u201cformal impeachment inquiry to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges\u201d against Trump, while only 43 percent disapprove.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

In that poll, 24 percent of Americans think \u201cthere is enough evidence for Congress to impeach Donald Trump and remove him from office now.\u201d More than three in 10, 31 percent, think \u201cCongress should hold an impeachment inquiry to determine if there is enough evidence to see if he should remain or be removed from office.\u201d And 39 percent think \u201cthere is now enough evidence for Congress to hold an impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump, and he should finish his term as president.\u201d\n\nPutting that together, roughly 55 percent of Americans support the impeachment inquiry, and 39 percent oppose it.\n\nOn a subsequent question, respondents are asked whether, \u201cbased upon what you know today,\u201d Trump should be impeached and removed. On that question, 43 percent say he should be impeached and removed, while slightly more, 49 percent, say he should not.\n\nThe POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, which found more consistent support between the inquiry and further steps toward impeachment and removal, also found a similar split when it comes to the political ramifications of possible floor votes in both chambers.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry is drawing strong \u2014 and divisive \u2014 interest from voters with an eye toward the 2020 election,\u201d said Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult\u2019s vice president. \u201cFor instance, roughly four in 10 voters would be more likely to vote for a senator who backs removing Trump from office, including seven in 10 Democrats. This compares with 35 percent who say they are less likely to vote for a senator who backs removal, including seven in 10 Republicans.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans have argued that the 31 Democrats who currently hold seats in districts that Trump carried in 2016 could be squeezed by a future vote on articles of impeachment, while Senate Democrats argue conversely that the two GOP senators in states Hillary Clinton won that year would face pressure to convict Trump based on his conduct.\n\nWhile the poll shows voters divided on impeachment, a solid majority disapproves of Trump\u2019s conduct over the past week. Nearly six in 10, 58 percent, say it was inappropriate for Trump to publicly urge China and Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Only 28 percent think that was appropriate.\n\nDespite the rash of negative news coverage, Trump\u2019s approval rating remains at 41 percent in the new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll \u2014 identical to last week\u2019s survey. But 57 percent of voters disapprove of Trump\u2019s job performance, including 46 percent who strongly disapprove.\n\nThe POLITICO/Morning Consult poll surveyed 1,991 registered voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nMorning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.\n\nMore details on the poll and its methodology can be found in these two documents: Toplines: https://politi.co/2LW4qHn | Crosstabs: https://politi.co/33iSntM\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0b/ee/348508ce40028fd5c35eb00fef5c/191008-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
