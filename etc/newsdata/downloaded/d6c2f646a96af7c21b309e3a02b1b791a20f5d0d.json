Researchers analyzing data from the Rover are extrapolating from the data that rocks enriched by mineral salts are evidence of briny ponds that went through periods of drying out and overflowing. Those deposits serve as a watermark made by climate fluctuations as Mars\u2019 climate changed from a wet one to the current frigid ice desert it is today.\n\nThe next step in their research is for scientists to understand how long the transition took and when it happened, according to a statement from NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nThe Gale Crater is the leftover geological formation from an impact that changed the surface of Mars. Eventually water and wind filled in the crater and the hardening sediment, carved by wind, created the Mount Sharp geological formation that the Curiosity Rover is scaling right now.\n\nThe Rover is taking samples of each layer as it climbs and sending that data back to reveal new information about the environment on Mars over time, NASA said.\n\n\u201cWe went to Gale Crater because it preserves this unique record of a changing Mars,\u201d said lead author William Rapin of Caltech, in a statement. \u201cUnderstanding when and how the planet\u2019s climate started evolving is a piece of another puzzle: When and how long was Mars capable of supporting microbial life at the surface?\u201d\n\nRapin and his co-authors found salts across a 500-foot-tall section of sedimentary rocks that Curiosity first visited in 2017. The \u201cSutton Island\u201d salts suggest that water had collected in pools across the formation in addition to the intermittent very dry periods that the scientists had already discovered.\n\nScientists speculate that the geological formations may have resembled the salt lakes in South America\u2019s Altiplano. Streams and . rivers flowing . from mountain ranges lead to similar basins as the Martian terrain. And those lakes are similarly influenced by climactic changes.\n\n\u201cFinding inclined layers represents a major change, where the landscape isn\u2019t completely underwater anymore,\u201d said Team member Chris Fedo, who specializes in the study of sedimentary layers at the University of Tennessee. \u201cWe may have left the era of deep lakes behind.\u201d\n\nFuture missions will see Curiosity driving toward more inclined layers to investigate rock structures. If they formed in drier conditions, that may mean a new phase of development for the crater \u2014 and reveal still more secrets about life on Mars from millions of years ago.", "description": "On its latest trek through the Gale Crater on Mars, the Curiosity Rover has discovered evidence that\u2019s leading . scientists to believe that there was an oasis at the base of that 150-kilometer-wide crater.
