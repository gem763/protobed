Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) handling of the impeachment inquiry warranted his removal from that committee.\n\nMcCarthy told FNC\u2019s Sean Hannity the impeachment should be handled as if it were a trial, but under House Democrats\u2019 direction, it is not.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s treat it how we treat every American \u2013 let\u2019s be fair in the process,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cCould you imagine ever going before a trial where you could not call a witness? You could not subpoena anybody? You could not cross-examine? This is a political hack job. But you know what happened today is even more insightful. Inside the intel community, Inspector General Michael Atkinson \u2013 he came to testify. You know what we found out through that testimony? We found out that this so-called hearsay whistleblower never even told the IG that they already met with Adam Schiff\u2019s staff.\u201d\n\nAccording to McCarthy, given Schiff and his committee staff had met with the so-called whistleblower, Schiff and his staff have become \u201cfact witnesses,\u201d which is a conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cIt goes to the question of political motive, and it\u2019s hearsay, but more importantly it goes to the fact that his own staff, Schiff, and Schiff himself are fact witnesses,\u201d he continued. \u201cNowhere in the American judicial system does it ever allow a fact witness to ever be the prosecutor. He should be removed from the committee. His staff should be removed. But now they\u2019re trying to control it.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Friday during an appearance on Fox News, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) argued House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep.
