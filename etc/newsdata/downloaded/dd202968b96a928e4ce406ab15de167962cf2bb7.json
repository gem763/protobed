Nevils reported the incident to NBC, prompting the peacock network to fire the anchor in 2017.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time,\u201d NBC News told the outlet in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\nNevils spoke to Farrow as part of his soon-to-be-released book, \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d She recalled how she had six shots of vodka during a night at the hotel bar with Lauer and fellow Peacock network anchor Meredith Vieira. He invited her back to his room, and obliged, having, as she told Farrow, \u201cno reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.\u201d\n\nBut when she showed up, Lauer allegedly began kissing her and then moved her onto the hotel bed and asked her if \u201cshe liked anal sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said that she declined several times,\u201d Farrow wrote. \u201c[Nevils] was in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested again when he \u2018just did it,\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d Nevils told Farrow. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nShe did not immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 request for comment.\n\nNevils, who lives on the Upper West Side, did not report the incident to law enforcement at the time of the alleged assault, Page Six reported.\n\n\u201cBrooke thought it was all her fault and she stayed that way until the #MeToo movement came along,\u201d a source told the tabloid.\n\nOn Thursday, an NYPD spokesperson told FOX Business they had not received any police reports that matched the description of the incident. But even if the police department had received a complaint, the spokesperson said, the department would be limited in what they could do.\n\n\u201c[If] she made a complaint to the NYPD, they would take the info and forward it to Sochi,\u201d a former high-ranking police source told FOX Business. However, \u201c[i]f Sochi asks the NYPD to conduct a [preliminary] investigation they would.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Russia could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nLauer provided a letter to Variety, in which he confirmed the \u201cextramarital affair\u201d with Nevils and called each sexual act \u201cmutual and completely consensual.\u201d\n\nThe former staffer continued seeing Lauer fearing, she said, the control he had over her professional life.
