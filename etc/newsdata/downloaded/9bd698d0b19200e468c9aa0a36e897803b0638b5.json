It\u2019s generally believed to be a result of consumers shifting online, stimulated by the rise of e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN). But what\u2019s less obvious is why some retailers have managed to survive the retail apocalypse, while others haven\u2019t.\n\nWhile 75,000 retail stores are expected to close shop by 2026 according to UBS, a separate report from research and advisory firm IHL Group found that more chains are opening new locations than closing them.\n\nThese include companies like Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and 7-Eleven, which are seeing healthy expansion.\n\n(Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance) More\n\nThe two key reasons why some retailers are able to weather the headwinds were that they didn\u2019t hold too much debt and didn\u2019t expand too quickly in the past decade, the IHL Group stated.\n\n\u201cRetailers without these characteristics have continued to thrive in this market,\u201d the report noted,\u201d adding that when a retailer closes a lot of stores, \u201cit is more of an indictment on the individual retailer rather than an overall retail industry problem as has often been reported.\u201d\n\nBeahm disagreed.\n\n\u201cI don't know that the number of stores counts so much as let's say the number of square feet per store,\u201d said Beahm. \u201cWhat you're seeing is, as consumers are changing their buying habits \u2014 from shopping purely in brick and mortar to buying more online \u2014 there's less need to carry the merchandise.\u201d\n\nAnd so it becomes \u201ca matter of how much space do you allocate for those walk in customers, or those customers who still prefer to shop in brick-and-mortar versus those shoppers who prefer to buy online,\u201d he added.\n\nForever 21 is not alone\n\nSeveral retailers haven\u2019t exactly had a crystal ball in the Amazon age and have ended up filing for bankruptcy in recent years.
