Less than a year after the deal was made, in August 2018, ByteDance scrubbed the Musical.ly brand and revamped it into the TikTok app.\n\nOwned by Beijing-based ByteDance, one of the world's most valuable tech unicorns, the social media video app known as Douyin in China and TikTok outside its home market, has gathered a total of 1 billion monthly active users across the world as of January this year, Douyin president Zhang Nan announced in June.\n\nTikTok, which was launched in the international market in September 2017, has become one of the most popular social media apps across many overseas markets, including Southeast Asia and India, Japan, and North America.\n\nByteDance has always separated the content for its domestic Douyin and the international TikTok in order to avoid any potential breaches of China's internet controls. Domestic Chinese users who register the app with a local phone number can only view local content which can be censored by the Chinese government, while foreigners using the international version are less likely to be subject to censorship as it is run independently from the Chinese team.\n\nTikTok expects the hiring moves will help \"maintain the app experience users expect while providing them the protections they deserve\". The company will continue to provide updates and transparency in the months and years ahead, according to the open letter.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTikTok opens Indian data centre in wake of accusations of hosting pornographers and sexual predators\n\nIndia has become TikTok's most prized and fastest growing market and one that it cannot afford to lose, hence the announcement that it will set up a local data centre.\n\nGoogle and Apple asked to remove China's TikTok in India: Report\n\nThe decision follows reports that Foxconn is looking to expand manufacturing operations in India.\n\nYouTube policy on removing 'instructional hacking' content causes infosec community outrage\n\nVideos removed from a prominent educational channel brought the policy to light.
