Iran denies involvement. Trump has shown restraint in the crisis, holding back from military retaliation despite pressure from hawkish allies, at least for now.\n\nBut he promised to keep trying to squeeze Iran\u2019s economy with sanctions until Tehran agrees to give up what Washington says is a pursuit of nuclear weapons. Iran has said its nuclear programme has always been for peaceful purposes only.\n\n\u201cAll nations have a duty to act. No responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust. As long as Iran\u2019s menacing behaviour continues, sanctions will not be lifted, they will be tightened,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFox News Channel aired a clip of an interview with Rouhani in which he replied to a question about Trump\u2019s \u201cbloodlust\u201d comment.\n\nThe United States was carrying out air strikes in Syria, he said. \u201cAnd today America unfortunately is a supporter of terrorism in our region. And wherever America has gone, terrorism has expanded in their wake,\u201d Rouhani said.\n\nIn the interview, Rouhani also reiterated Iran\u2019s stance that the United States must lift economic pressures that he said made it difficult for his country to procure even basic medicines.\n\n\u201cThis is a type of terrorism, this is inhumane. And if there is a cessation to this, then, of course, the atmosphere will change,\u201d Rouhani said, according to a translation of his remarks by Fox, saying that if Washington did so, the two sides could reach agreements on nuclear as well as other issues.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump addresses the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nCHINA TRADE WAR\n\nTrump had a stern message for China and its president, Xi Jinping, with whom he is locked in a trade war that is damaging both country\u2019s economies. He said the world is watching how Beijing handles mass demonstrations in Hong Kong that have heightened fears of a potential Chinese crackdown.\n\n\u201cHow China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has sought to pressure China to agree to reduce trade barriers through a policy of increasing tariffs on Chinese products. He accused China of the theft of trade secrets \u201con a grand scale\u201d and said it was taking advantage of World Trade Organization rules that give Beijing beneficial treatment as a \u201cdeveloping economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial to both countries. But as I have made clear I will not accept a bad deal for the American people,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump was tough on Iran and its leadership, with Rouhani in New York for U.N. activities amid speculation about whether they might meet to discuss their differences.\n\nAn Iranian diplomat sat in Iran\u2019s second-row seat for Trump\u2019s speech. Rouhani was at his New York hotel, not in the U.N. chamber.\n\nIn remarks to media on Tuesday Rouhani said he was open to discuss small changes, additions or amendments to a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers if the United States lifted sanctions imposed on the Islamic republic.\n\nFrance\u2019s Macron and Britain\u2019s Johnson both urged Rouhani to meet with Trump this week, according to a UK press pool report.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that if he leaves the country without meeting with President Trump, this is a lost opportunity. Because he will not come back in a few months. And President Trump will not go to Tehran so they have to meet now,\u201d Macron said during a meeting with Rouhani and Johnson.\n\n\u201cI think I agree with Emmanuel. You need to be on the side of the swimming pool and jump at the same time,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel met Rouhani on Tuesday and said she told him she would welcome U.S. talks with Iran but that it was unrealistic for Tehran to think sanctions would be lifted before talks take place.\n\nOver the past week, Trump has tightened economic sanctions on Iran and ordered more U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a show of support for those U.S. allies in the tense region.\n\n\u201cAmerica is ready to embrace friendship to all who genuinely seek peace and respect,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe United States has never believed in permanent enemies. We want partners, not adversaries.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nA senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said details of U.S. defensive equipment and forces going to Saudi Arabia will likely be unveiled this week and that Washington could change what it sends if European allies can contribute, as the Pentagon hopes.\n\nThe U.S. contributions will likely focus on air defence systems to protect vulnerable targets, the official said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday denounced Iran's \"bloodlust\" and called on other nations to join the United States to apply pressure on Iran after attacks on Saudi oil facilities, but said there is a path to peace.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433413214&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1N0", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
