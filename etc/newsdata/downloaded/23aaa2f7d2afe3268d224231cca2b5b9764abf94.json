They are seen as the frontrunners, the sources said. But Nissan\u2019s board and Renault have kept up dialogue with Indian-born Ashwani Gupta, and a possible external candidate.\n\nGupta, 49, joined Renault in 2006 in India as a purchasing manager, and was sent this year to Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp as chief operating officer.\n\nGupta was interviewed by Senard on Tuesday via TV conference, the sources said.\n\nThe support of Renault, which has a 43.4% stake in Nissan, will be critical in winning the race, as will support from Japan\u2019s trade ministry, which has intervened in Nissan\u2019s affairs, sensitive to Renault's upper hand in the alliance.\n\nA Renault spokesman declined to comment.\n\nOne issue Senard raised, according to the sources, was Nissan\u2019s ability and willingness to defend its dividend payout, which was cut for the fiscal year ended March 31 following a 45% decline in Nissan\u2019s operating profit. That dividend cut wiped 130 million euros ($146 million) off Renault\u2019s 2019 earnings.\n\nNissan is forecasting earnings to continue to slip this fiscal year.\n\nYamauchi came out of his meeting in Paris with Senard smiling, according to one of the sources. Seki, meanwhile, also met Senard in Paris and told his colleagues he \"had a blast\" with the Frenchman, according to a message viewed by Reuters.\n\nRelations between Renault and Nissan have been strained since the 2018 arrest in Japan of the alliance's architect, Carlos Ghosn, on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies. Nissan executives have pushed for a restructuring of the alliance and more independence from Renault.\n\nThe tensions contributed earlier this year to the collapse of a proposed merger between Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.\n\n\u201cWe want (Nissan\u2019s) board to pick a leader that can restore Nissan\u2019s business and free us from all the politics we\u2019ve been forced to cope with,\u201d one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nThe selection process highlights an internal debate over Nissan's strategy. Ghosn sought to combine tight cost control with ambitious expansion goals. But Nissan's profits have plunged to a 10-year low, undercut by low-margin sales to rental fleets aimed at propping up market share.\n\nNissan's next CEO faces a restructuring task, and tough choices about where to focus investment as China and Europe demand more electric vehicles.\n\nNissan\u2019s board of directors has narrowed a list of candidates in part by using a business school style-CEO aptitude test to measure candidates\u2019 leadership quality, sources said.\n\nYamauchi, the acting CEO, was groomed as a cost manager and climbed the ranks under Ghosn. He is favored by older top managers, people familiar with internal discussions said.\n\nSeki is backed by younger leaders and is especially popular among rank and file employees who see him as more likely to chart a new course for Nissan.\n\nSeki has been leading the company\u2019s recovery team which is looking at a deeper restructuring of the business that would shutter plants in some markets and exit certain global markets and vehicle segments.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "The Nissan Motor Co CEO race has narrowed to a contest between three Renault-Nissan veterans, with Renault's chairman conducting interviews ahead of a Renault-Nissan alliance meeting, people familiar with the matter said.
