Instead, they squandered several chances to score, never taking advantage of San Francisco\u2019s inability to rumble through their defense the way it has through everyone else\u2019s.\n\nEventually, the Redskins lost, 9-0, giving the franchise\u2019s former offensive coordinator and current 49ers Coach Kyle Shanahan a revenge victory and leaving them watching the Niners players celebrate a 6-0 start by diving across the puddles. Washington, meanwhile, remains stuck in the mud at 1-6.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe caught the rabbit eating carrots and we kicked him in the back, but we just couldn\u2019t grab him to cook him up and eat him,\u201d Washington linebacker Ryan Anderson said, in what seemed a perfect summation of what had happened on the field.\n\nFor more than a half, the Redskins outplayed the 49ers. Running back Adrian Peterson splashed through the San Francisco defenders\u2019 attempts at tackles. Quarterback Case Keenum had more passing yards than the Niners Jimmy Garoppolo (which wasn\u2019t hard to do, because Garoppolo only had 10 passing yards at halftime). They even stopped the 49ers\u2019 feared three-man running attack. Yet, none of it did them any good.\n\nThe rain kept pouring down, swirling around the stadium\u2019s half-filled tiers, and Washington struggled to take advantage.\n\nAD\n\nHow about this for a break not seized?\n\nAD\n\nPeterson carried the ball on the game\u2019s first seven plays, sloshing past the Niners tacklers who struggled to keep their feet, let alone grab hold of a 220-pound future Hall of Fame running back in a soaking wet uniform. He gained 36 yards on those first seven carries and wound up with 49 yards in total on the first drive as Washington got all the way to the 49ers\u2019 21 only to have a holding penalty push them back. The march killed, Interim Coach Bill Callahan sent out kicker Dustin Hopkins to attempt a 39-yard field goal from a puddle.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those things where we say: \u2018Let\u2019s give it a try and hope for the best,\u2019\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nAD\n\nHe missed, by a lot.\n\n\u201cI just felt we\u2019d be back in it and have another opportunity,\u201d Callahan said.\n\nAnd they did get another opportunity, late in the first half, when they got to the San Francisco 28 and didn\u2019t dare attempt a field goal on a 4th-and-1 play, handing the ball to Peterson, who ran forward and got knocked backward for a one-yard loss.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA play we\u2019ve gone to many times and not to get that executed was disappointing,\u201d Callahan lamented.\n\nBut a quarter later they were there yet again, this time on the Niners\u2019 29 and surging toward the end zone. At the time, San Francisco was clutching to a 3-0 lead. Only 1:20 was left in the third quarter, it was first and 10 and Peterson cut right, was tackled and as he tumbled to the mud, the ball fell from his hands. Defensive tackle Jullian Taylor recovered it. The Niners players jumped in the air, while Peterson sat in the mud and slammed his fist into the slop.\n\nAD\n\nThat was the last of the Redskins\u2019 great chances. Elated, the 49ers moved the ball better in the fourth quarter, holding onto the ball for all but 2:44 of the game\u2019s final 15 minutes. They kicked two more field goals and Washington\u2019s players were left to stand in the cold, hard rain and contemplate the chances that have slipped away for this entire dreary season.\n\nAD\n\nAfterward, the Redskins locker room emptied quickly. There wasn\u2019t much for them to say. Hopkins said he didn\u2019t want to use the weather as an excuse for a missed kick, but he also shrugged because, of course the downpour had everything to do with why it went awry. Offensive tackle Donald Penn saw hope in nearly beating one of the NFL\u2019s best teams, but then he shook his head, sighed about the missed chances and said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to learn that when we get people by the neck we have to choke them out.\u201d\n\nStanding in front of his locker, Peterson pulled on a shirt, saw a mob of approaching reporters and gagged a bit. At least it sounded like a gag. It might have been a gurgle, given the amount of water that had accumulated outside.\n\nAD\n\nHe had only run for 81 yards after his promising first drive. He smiled sadly and thought about the fumble that had left the Redskins last best opportunity sitting in the mud beside him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt hurts even more because the guy didn\u2019t even punch it out,\u201d he said about Niners linebacker Kwon Alexander, who knocked the ball from his hands.\n\nDown the damp corridor from Washington\u2019s locker room, Kyle Shanahan was standing before his players and dedicating the game ball to his father, Mike, the ex-Redskins Coach who was fired by Redskins Owner Daniel Snyder after the 2013 season. Mike Shanahan wasn\u2019t there to get the ball, but the message was delivered.\n\nThe delighted son had been able to avenge his father\u2019s firing, while the Redskins suffered in a wet, cold misery of opportunities missed yet again.\n\nAD", "description": "Washington\u2019s players lament the missed opportunity to beat an undefeated team in challenging weather conditions, and fall to 1-6 on the season.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yhUTK4lqu5fjZFjJMQDQeaxk0DA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N4ECDQHTO4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
