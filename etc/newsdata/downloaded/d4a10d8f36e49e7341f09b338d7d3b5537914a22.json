And millions of PCB-containing fluorescent light ballasts probably remain in older schools and day care centers, where they can leak, smolder and catch fire.\n\nYet the Environmental Protection Agency never attempted to determine the scope of PCB contamination or assess potential health risks because of a lack of funding, political pressure and pushback from industry and education groups, according to dozens of interviews and thousands of pages of documents examined by The Associated Press.\n\nMembers of Congress who promised three years ago to find money to help schools address PCBs and other pollutants never introduced legislation. At the EPA, a rule to require schools and day cares to remove PCB-containing ballasts moved slowly under the Obama administration and then was quashed by President Donald Trump as part of deregulation efforts.\n\nTom Simons, a now-retired EPA regulator who worked on the rule, said getting rid of ballasts was the least the EPA could do to protect children.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was a no-brainer: There are millions out there. These things are smoking and dripping, so let\u2019s put this through,\u201d Simons said.\n\nPCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, have been linked to increased long-term risks of cancer, immune and reproductive impairment and learning problems.\n\nThey were manufactured by Monsanto Co. and used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment until they were banned in 1979. By then they were in transformers, air conditioners, adhesives and billions of light ballasts in schools, hospitals, homes, offices and commercial and industrial buildings.\n\nThey also were ubiquitous in the environment and building up in human bodies.\n\nBut nobody worried about schools.\n\nThen a 2004 study by Harvard health professor Robert Herrick identified the widespread use of PCBs in caulk in schools built before 1980, estimating that up to 26,000 buildings and 14 million students could be affected.\n\nThe EPA later found PCBs in caulk and other materials could get into the air or dust and be absorbed by walls and other surfaces. The agency also discovered that many older schools still were using PCB-containing fluorescent light ballasts.\n\nIn California\u2019s wealthy Santa Monica-Malibu School District, parents, including model Cindy Crawford, sued after tests of caulk found PCB levels up to 11,000 times the EPA\u2019s threshold. The district ultimately agreed to get rid of PCBs. It has torn down a middle school and continues to remove them from other buildings.\n\nIn Hartford, Connecticut, an elementary school in a low-income African American neighborhood was closed because the city could not afford to remove PCBs. The city has sued Monsanto and a company that made caulk to recover the costs.\n\n\u201cIt was the crown jewel of the neighborhood,\u201d former city council member Steven Harris said of J.C. Clark Elementary. \u201cOur school board is doing the best they can. The reality is we don\u2019t have a lot of money.\u201d\n\nMonsanto, now owned by Bayer Crop Sciences, has denied responsibility in lawsuits involving several school districts. The company said there is no proof PCBs cause significant health problems, especially at levels found in buildings.\n\nParents and teachers from a public alternative school in Monroe, Washington, believe that dripping and smoking light ballasts made them sick and have filed their own lawsuit.\n\nExperts say proving PCBs caused specific illnesses likely is impossible because problems can take years to develop and not everyone who\u2019s exposed will get sick. Still, it\u2019s crucial to reduce the chemicals in schools because children are more vulnerable and continued exposure begins to \u201cchisel away at the margin of safety,\u201d said Mark Maddaloni, a former EPA toxicologist.\n\nFormer officials said the EPA was hamstrung by a politically fraught problem that could cost billions of dollars. What\u2019s more, many schools also had other high-priority pollutants such as lead, asbestos and mold.\n\nSo instead of requiring - or encouraging - schools to test for PCBs, the EPA recommended thorough cleaning and ventilation and said districts could cover materials that might contain PCBs until buildings were renovated or razed.\n\nThat guidance outlined important steps schools could take to reduce exposure regardless of their finances, said Tom Huetteman, former assistant director of the PCB program at San Francisco-based EPA Region 9.\n\n\u201cIt would be great if there was zero exposure in schools, but that\u2019s not the world we live in,\u201d Huetteman said.\n\nCurrent EPA officials said in written responses that the agency\u2019s recommended precautions are usually effective, but those steps might not adequately reduce exposure in every school. They also said the agency is \u201cactively identifying\u201d money for a program targeting school environmental hazards.\n\nThe best chance to address PCBs was by removing light ballasts because it was comparatively easy and saved schools money on electric bills, said Judith Enck, administrator of the EPA\u2019s Region 2 under Obama. She helped get hundreds of thousands of ballasts - many leaking - out of almost 900 New York City schools.\n\nThe EPA estimates there are 2.6 million ballasts in schools and a half-million in day cares nationally, with up to 70 percent leaking. It recommends removing old ballasts despite the failed ban, and many districts have.\n\nBut Enck said removing the ballasts is not enough.\n\n\u201cThe debate was never based on science and health. It was \u2018We don\u2019t want the grief from schools, and it\u2019s a lot of work and we have other priorities,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI disagreed.\u201d\n\nHerrick, the Harvard professor, said he\u2019s frustrated that neither the EPA nor Congress attempted to create a \u201ccoherent national policy\u201d on PCBs.\n\n\u201cThey intentionally dodged their responsibility to put some sort of framework around the problem,\u201d said Herrick, who retired last year. \u201cI think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want the answer.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWebber reported from Hartford, Connecticut, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
