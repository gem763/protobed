He was 86.\n\nHis death was confirmed by the Fondation Chirac in Paris.\n\nMr. Chirac was elected to two consecutive terms as president, beginning in 1995, having already served as prime minister under centrist and Socialist presidents.\n\nAt his death, he was most remembered for his defiant stand against the United States-led war in Iraq, his ability to preside over a state in which power was divided between the left and the right \u2014 comity that is hardly imaginable today \u2014 and his championing the European Union.", "description": "President from 1995 to 2007, he took a stand against the U.S.-led war in Iraq. His reputation was damaged by a 2011 conviction for embezzlement.", "authors": ["James F.
