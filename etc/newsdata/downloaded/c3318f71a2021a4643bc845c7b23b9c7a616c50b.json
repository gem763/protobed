The fund will be wound up and any cash returned to investors. It follows a series of disastrous investments.\n\nThat sacking initially prompted an angry response, with Mr Woodford saying it was a decision \"I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests\" of the business.\n\nBut on Tuesday evening, in a further announcement, he said the last two funds - Income Focus and Woodford Patient Capital - would be shut.\n\n'Deep regrets'\n\nHe said: \"We have taken the highly painful decision to close Woodford Investment Management. We will fulfil our fund management responsibilities to WPCT and the LF Woodford Income Focus Fund and once completed will close the company in an orderly fashion.\n\n\"I personally deeply regret the impact events have had on individuals who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management and invested in our funds.\"\n\nMr Woodford became a household name during 26 years at Invesco, where his stockpicking expertise turned \u00a31,000 invested at the start into more than \u00a325,000 by the time he left.\n\nHis stellar reputation meant that savers poured millions into his new funds. But several big investments in stock market listed companies performed poorly, and investors began withdrawing money.\n\nTo compound the problems, Mr Woodford built up stakes in a number of unlisted technology and healthcare companies he believed had strong growth potential.\n\nBut when the redemption requests gathered pace, he found it difficult to raise money quickly by selling stakes in these private companies.\n\nThe Equity Income Fund was suspended in June after being crippled by redemption demands. It meant that investors' money would be locked in for months.\n\nRyan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment firm AJ Bell, said there was \"a feeling of inevitability\" about the closure. Without any money coming in \"it was difficult to see how the business could survive\", he said.\n\nThe unwinding of the funds will be a long process. Darius McDermott, managing director of financial adviser Chelsea Financial Services, said the situation was \"a mess\" and the flagship fund's closure would make it \"a forced seller of all stocks\".\n\nAnalysis: Kevin Peachey, personal finance correspondent:\n\nNeil Woodford had been the darling of the armchair investor - but, as one said today, the whole thing had become \"toxic\".\n\nFour years ago, he was giving them 20% returns. Now he is giving them losses, a lot of uncertainty, and perhaps a lesson in hubris.\n\nSome of those investors will be kicking themselves for being too reliant on a \"star\" manager, rather than spreading their investments, as has always been the advice.\n\nThe fund manager may soon have found he had nothing left to manage, so commentators say it was inevitable that he has thrown in the towel.\n\nThose stockpickers who remain in the ring may find individual investors are a lot more cautious about giving them their support, and their money.", "description": "The UK's best-known stockpicker shuts his firm after a crash in the value of his multi-billion-pound funds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2E6C/production/_109248811_47c2a33e-11ae-4ae8-aa7e-e7ec00533a0f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
