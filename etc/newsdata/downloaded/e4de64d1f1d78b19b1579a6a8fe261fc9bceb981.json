It wasn\u2019t a particularly good stab. It was bulky, it required two micro SD cards, and the footage was a royal pain to work with. In the intervening years, we\u2019ve seen decent 360 cameras from the likes of Garmin, Insta360 and Rylo, but this sub-genre of action cam hasn\u2019t really caught on. The $799.95 GoPro Max hopes to change this by putting a focus on enabling creativity.\n\nLet\u2019s start off with the basics. The Max is 33-per cent lighter and 20-per cent smaller than the Fusion. It requires only one micro SD card, and it stitches the footage from its two lenses together right there on the camera, thankfully.\n\nIt also has a built-in 1.7-inch 16:9 touchscreen, which is great for framing shots and changing settings, but you can\u2019t actually scroll around the full 360-degree world with it. It\u2019s waterproof to 16.5 feet, and you can use it as a 360 cam or an action cam. It supports live-streaming (though not in 360 mode), it shoots killer 16.5MP panoramas, and it has the best stabilisation on any camera I\u2019ve ever seen. Still, it\u2019s many miles from perfect.\n\nGoPro Hero Max WHAT IS IT? GoPro's second take on a 360 action camera PRICE $799.95 LIKE Versatility, so many angles from just one camera, easy-to-use apps, best-in camera stabilisation (period). NO LIKE No 4K, maxes out at 1080p60, mediocre battery life, mic doesn\u2019t live up to the hype.\n\n360-degree video on the internet is really still a novelty. Yeah, sites like YouTube and Facebook support it, and you can scroll around the perspective in these videos with your smartphone or mouse (or a VR headset), but it\u2019s still pretty niche.\n\nSo, while the Max does shoot 360-degree video, the big draw here is what you can do with that footage afterward: Pop out a 1080p frame and play director with a ton of flexibility. You can zoom, tilt, pan, roll, and really simulate a whole suite of cameras all using the same clip. It\u2019s actually a lot of fun to play with.\n\nThe easiest workflow goes like this:\n\nShoot your 360-degree footage with the Max. Use the GoPro app on your phone to transfer the footage over. Set your camera angles, moves, and transitions using keyframes. Export the video, which can be the traditional 1080p 16:9 clip, or more Instagram-friendly square or (God help you) portrait orientation.\n\nThat\u2019s really it. The keyframing takes a little bit of time to learn, but I think most people will be off to the races within ten minutes. You can accomplish the same thing with the GoPro Player app for Mac (plus additional codec options for export).\n\nWindows currently just has a GoPro Exporter, which turns your 360 footage into a 5,376 by 2,688 pixel flat video, which you can then work with in Adobe Premiere using the GoPro-supplied Reframe plug-in, though that\u2019s certainly the slowest and most-advanced option.\n\nThe net effect is that you can make your footage look really cool, even if what you\u2019re doing wasn\u2019t that spectacular. Things, like jogging up a hill or riding your bike down the street, don\u2019t look all that exciting when filmed with a standard action camera, but the Max really invites you to get creative, and you can achieve eye-popping things even from things that are fairly mundane.\n\nI think GoPro sees this as an untapped market: People who might feel their lifestyles aren\u2019t action-y enough to warrant an action cam, but who might enjoy filming things and making cool videos.\n\nIn addition to shooting in 360-degree mode, the Max can shoot from just the front or rear camera like a standard action camera. This has led GoPro to claim \u201cit\u2019s like three GoPros in one.\u201d So, obviously you should get this instead of the Hero8 Black, right? Pump your brakes, Sparky.\n\nWhile the 360-degree capabilities are great, when in \u201cHero Mode\u201d you are limited to 1080p60 (technically 1440p60). No rich, sharp, eye-popping 4K. No silky-smooth 1080p240 slow motion. The last time a GoPro was limited to 1080p60 was the Hero3 Black, even if image quality is infinitely better now.\n\nSo, there are some tradeoffs, but the Max in Hero mode has features that even the Hero8 Black doesn\u2019t. For starters, there\u2019s Max HyperSmooth. With the Hero8 Black GoPro debuted HyperSmooth 2.0, and it was fantastic. Max HyperSmooth is even better. Hand-holding a shot and pointing it straight made it look like it was on a tripod, and it pans that way, too, even though I don\u2019t have the steadiest of hands.\n\nIt\u2019s unreal how good it is, and it can even apply that level of stabilisation to Max SuperView, which is the widest angle GoPro has ever put on one of its \u201cdigital lenses.\u201d For strapping it to your chest while mountain biking, or putting it on a pole while snowboarding or skiing, it will be absolutely awesome.\n\nIt also has a new PowerPano mode. You know how taking a panoramic still with your phone requires you to slowly sweep your phone across the horizon, and if anything (a person, a dog, etc.) moves it will look all mutated? PowerPano leverages both lenses of the Max to shoot a 270-degree panorama in an instant. People jumping will be frozen in mid-air, cars won\u2019t be blurred, and it\u2019s all an instantly sharable 16MP photo. It\u2019s a great feature.\n\nThe camera is waterproof to 5 metres, which half of the Hero8\u2019s depth rating, but that doesn\u2019t really matter, because while you can take the Max surfing or kayaking, you can\u2019t use it underwater. This is a problem across all 360 cams, currently. Water on the lens changes the way light bends, and it messes up the stitching. So, this is not the camera for your next snorkelling trip.\n\nGoPro is working on a globe-like underwater housing for it, but there\u2019s no word on availability yet. The Max doesn\u2019t have replaceable lenses, either, so you\u2019re going to want to be a bit careful.\n\nIt does come with lens caps as well as some clear lens protectors that you can use while shooting. The protectors are just plastic, so they\u2019ll reduce image quality slightly, but if you\u2019re going to be doing something where crashing is a real possibility (mountain biking, say), I\u2019d definitely recommend them.\n\nPhoto: Brent Rose, Gizmodo\n\nIn 360 mode, the camera does a pretty solid job of hiding the stitch lines, but it\u2019s not flawless. GoPro recommends that the bottom of the camera be at least 50cm from the point where it\u2019s mounted. GoPro is making a new Max Grip + Tripod ($89.95) which accomplishes this nicely, as it extends to 22 inches.\n\nGoPro already makes the El Grande ($89.95) which is an extra-beefy 38-inch selfie-stick that would be perfect for the Max if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it uses a click-in mounting plate, which is just a bit too big to be cropped out. If GoPro would just (pretty please!) sell a replacement ball-joint with the standard three prongs on top so you could attach the camera directly to it, that would work incredibly well.\n\nThe 360 footage has very prominent lines when attached directly to a helmet or handlebar, but it\u2019s not dreadful. I did get to try it out with a \u201cnarwhal\u201d mount, which is basically a 15-inch metal bar that sticks out from your helmet like a horn.\n\nGoPro doesn\u2019t sell this because if a user caught it on a branch it might break their neck, but it was fun to borrow and play with. It\u2019s still just a little short to completely eliminate stitch lines, but this is what GoPro\u2019s pro athletes use in a lot of the base-jumping and snowboarding videos. This one from Jeb Corliss is a pretty frickin\u2019 amazing example:\n\nWhen it comes to editing footage, the iOS app is definitely the most-polished. It has various \u201ceasing\u201d options to smooth out the transitions between the digital pans, tilts, and zooms you\u2019ll make while reframing, but it also has a jump-cut mode, which I found to be surprisingly powerful.\n\nIt gives the illusion of having many different cameras mounted in different places and then cutting between angles. It\u2019s so cool! Unfortunately, easing is still missing from the Android app, but I was told it will be added soon.\n\nThe only thing I really have to call GoPro out on is its claim that the Max has \u201cshotgun-mic performance.\u201d Oh honey, no. The audio isn\u2019t bad, by any means, and it\u2019s easily the best of any 360 camera I\u2019ve tested, but it is nowhere approaching shotgun-mic quality. GoPro\u2019s own Hero8 Black sounds cleaner, sharper, and louder than the Max.\n\nI ran five separate audio tests just to make sure I wasn\u2019t crazy. I\u2019m not. The Max has a Stereo + 360 mode which does a good job of isolating voices in action situations, and you can choose to use just the front or back mics (or both) when shooting in Hero mode, but no configuration made it sound better than the Hero8 Black, and that\u2019s before we factor in the new mic accessories that are coming soon to the latter camera. This is a shame for a camera that\u2019s being marketed to vloggers.\n\nAnother note about the Stereo +360-degree audio. What that means is that when shooting in 360 mode, the camera uses all of its mics to create a 3D soundscape (\u201cspherical ambisonic\u201d audio, if you wanna get technical). In theory, if you\u2019re watching the footage with a high-end VR headset, and a branch snaps behind you, it should sound like it\u2019s actually behind you.\n\nThis is a very cool feature, in theory at least. Because you can\u2019t use it yet. Well, the camera is recording it, and it\u2019s saving that data, but none of GoPro\u2019s own apps (on any of the four platforms) can currently make use of it. Eventually the apps will be updated to take advantage of it, but for now, it translates that sound to standard stereo.\n\nPhoto: Brent Rose, Gizmodo The GoPro Hero 8 Black (left) versus the GoPro Max (right).

While the iPhone and Android apps are arguably the easiest to use, if you\u2019re trying to upload a 360-degree equirectangular VR video (for YouTube or Facebook), you\u2019re limited to 4K resolution, which is roughly a 25-per cent reduction in size from the footage\u2019s potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re reframing to 1080p then that\u2019s a moot point, but it\u2019s worth noting that in order to do that (or anything with these videos) you have to transfer the footage to your phone, which eats up a lot of storage space until you manually delete the files. The OSX GoPro Player has all of the features that the iOS version has (including the easing options, which Android currently lacks), and you can go a full 5.6K in your 360 exports, as well as use other video codecs.\n\nThe Windows GoPro Exporter lags far behind and is really just a tool to turn your raw files into equirectangular videos you can work with in Premiere (which not everybody has). I would really love to see parity among the apps.\n\nAll photos: Brent Rose (Gizmodo)\n\nThe Max has GoPro\u2019s TimeWarp (read: hyperlapse) feature in both Hero and 360 modes. In Hero mode, you can tap the screen to switch between real-time and sped-up time as you go. The 360 mode can\u2019t do real-time yet, but it does an excellent job of stabilising everything in view and locking in on the horizon and north-south-east-west orientation. That\u2019s true of all 360 footage, actually. It really does a tremendous job of stabilising everything in camera.\n\nShooting 5.6K 360-degree video is pretty taxing, but the battery faired better than I expected. Shooting in 360-mode the battery lasted 1 hour and 11.5 minutes. That\u2019s about 20 minutes less than I get shooting the Hero8 Black at 4K24.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to be doing much shooting it\u2019s going to be worth having at least one spare battery with you. The big caveat here is that the camera overheated and shut itself down 51 minutes into shooting. Now, it may be unlikely that you would want a single shot that long anyway, but it\u2019s still a bit troubling.\n\nOverall, I really like this camera a lot. I actually had fun going through clips, trying different angles, and figuring out how I wanted to tell the story. It just gives you so many more options to play with, and that feels novel and exciting. It\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019ve shot with other consumer-focused 360 cameras, including the Insta360 One X, the Rylo, and the Garmin Virb 360, and I think the GoPro Max produces the most vivid, highest-quality footage (though I do love the Garmin\u2019s tough hardware), and that footage was the easiest to work with.\n\nThe Insta360 and Rylo aren\u2019t even waterproof without purchasing an additional case, and I had problems with both cameras eating footage. There are high-grade options that shoot 8K and above, but those cameras are typically far more expensive. So, if you know that you want a 360 camera, yes, the GoPro Max is the one I would recommend, full stop.\n\nBut, if you\u2019ve only got the money for one camera, should you buy the Max ($799.95) or the Hero8 Black ($599.95)? That\u2019s a trickier question because they\u2019re ultimately such different cameras and it depends on what your needs are. If you\u2019re primarily making videos for Instagram, TikTok, or stuff like that, then you might be better-served by the Max, simply because it gives you so many options to play with, and it will make your content stand out more.\n\nFor me, though, I want to make sure my stuff looks good on larger screens, and so the quality (and flexibility) of 4K is very important to me. Footage from the Hero8 Black looks cleaner and more vivid, too, and it\u2019s smaller, lighter, cheaper, and ready to shoot underwater.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s up to your preferences, but I will say that despite its flaws the Max is a welcome entrant in the world of action cameras. Think of it as the artistic kid in the family that kinds stands out, but in a good way.\n\nPhoto: Brent Rose, Gizmodo\n\nREADME", "description": "Two years ago, GoPro took its first stab at a 360-degree action camera with the GoPro Fusion.
