The large-cap index advanced nearly 19% for the first three quarters of 2019, posting its best first three-quarter start to the year since 1997.\n\nHere were the main moves in the market by the end of regular trading:\n\nS&P 500 (^GSPC): +0.55%, or 16.36 points\n\nDow (^DJI): +0.52%, or 138.60 points\n\nNasdaq (^IXIC): +0.76%, or 60.04 points\n\nU.S. crude oil prices (CL=F): -3.3% to $54.07 per barrel\n\n10-year Treasury yield (^TNX): +0.5 bps to 1.678%\n\nGold (GC=F): -1.79% to $1,479.50 per ounce\n\nStocks on Monday reversed last week\u2019s losses amid signs of another salvo in the U.S.-China trade war. Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was considering limiting U.S. investment into China by delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges and curbing Americans\u2019 exposure to Chinese assets in government pensions funds.\n\nHowever, the U.S. Treasury Department has since partially refuted the report, writing in a statement that the \u201cadministration is not contemplating blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges at this time.\u201d The response, however, did not address other means of limiting U.S. portfolio flows to China.\n\nShares of Chinese firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges including Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU) held onto gains from early trading as concerns over their delisting were put to rest.\n\nHigh-level talks between the U.S. and China are set to take place in Washington, D.C., in mid-October. Data on the Chinese economy has remained choppy in the weeks since the last mid-level talks between the two sides in September, with these reports reflecting the impact of the trade war with the U.S. on the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\nA new print overnight showed an unexpected increase in activity for China\u2019s key manufacturing sector, with domestic consumption helping to offset weakness in foreign demand.\n\nThe private Caixin/Markit\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose to a reading of 51.4 in September from 50.4 in August, holding above the neutral level of 50 to indicate expansion for a second consecutive month. September\u2019s reading marked the fastest pace of increase since February 2018 for the country\u2019s PMI.\n\nBut beneath the headline print, results were more mixed. China\u2019s new orders subindex climbed at the fastest pace since March 2018, while new export orders declined for a fourth consecutive month.\n\n\u201cThe recovery in China\u2019s manufacturing industry in September benefited mainly from the potential growth of domestic demand,\u201d Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group said in a statement. \u201cThe trade conflicts between China and the U.S. had a notable impact on exports, production costs and confidence of enterprises.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s government-issued manufacturing PMI rose to 49.8 in September from 49.5 in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday, beating consensus economist expectations. This represented the fifth consecutive month of contraction in manufacturing activity by the NBS\u2019s measure. Mirroring the results of the Caixin/Markit survey, output and new orders gauges rose, while new export orders remained in contractionary territory.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York.

The S&P 500 ended the month about 1.7% higher, and the quarter up by 1.2%. The Dow ended 1.9% and 1.2% higher for the month and quarter, respectively. The Nasdaq rose 0.5% for September, but was down by about 0.1% for the quarter.\n\nBoth the S&P 500 and Dow posted their best three-quarter starts to the year since 1997, while the Nasdaq posted its best three-quarter start since 2013.\n\nThe third quarter has seen a flurry of developments relating in trade, monetary policy and politics. Both the U.S. and China added tariffs on one another\u2019s goods, before later easing some of these tensions. The Federal Reserve cut rates for a second time this year, and the European Central Bank cut rates for the first time in three years, solidifying a global dovish monetary policy tilt. Attacks on the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure sent crude oil prices reeling, and ramped up the specter of further conflict in the Middle East.
