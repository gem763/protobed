It was one of those gaffes that underscores a candidate\u2019s central weakness and continues to bleed away votes long after its utterance.\n\nRecall Sen. John F. Kerry\u2019s \u201cI actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it,\u201d or then-President Gerald Ford\u2019s famous \u201cThere is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe\u201d from a 1976 debate. Gaffes are like sharks. Some are sand sharks that scare you. Others are Jaws-like beasts. After Thursday night, Biden is going to need a bigger boat.\n\nBecause it will haunt Biden\u2019s campaign, let\u2019s be sure to get the question and answer down in full, for context\u2019s sake.\n\nModerator Linsey Davis asked Biden, 76: \u201cIn a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, \u2018I don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.'\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said that some 40 years ago,\u201d Davis continued. \u201cBut as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\u201d\n\nBiden responded: \u201cWell, they have to deal with the \u2014 look, there\u2019s institutional segregation in this country. From the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Redlining banks, making sure we are in a position where \u2014 look, you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from $15 to $45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise, the equal raise to getting out \u2014 the $60,000 level.\n\n\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden responds to a question during the Democratic presidential primary debate in Houston on Thursday night. (David J. Phillip/AP)\n\n\"Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home, we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It\u2019s crazy. The teachers are \u2014 I\u2019m married to a teacher, my deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. Make sure that every single child does, in fact, have 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds go to school. School. Not day care. School. We bring social workers in to homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\u201d\n\nSo the moderator asked about America\u2019s original sin \u2014 slavery \u2014 and Biden somehow got to turning on record players, which wasn\u2019t an effort to coax the hipster vote away from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) no matter how much the millennials love vinyl. It was an incoherent, rambling illumination of the key knock on Biden: He\u2019s too old. Former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, during the debate, and Sen. Cory Booker, afterward, made this argument, first indirectly, then directly, but they didn\u2019t need to. Biden indicted himself on the age question.\n\nIf President Trump abandons \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d for \u201cRecordPlayerJoeBiden\u201d on Twitter, the tattoo on Biden that is probably already permanent gets inked in bright colors. Manhattan-Beltway media may scoff at the single-phrase branding, but every marketer knows it works and works and works.\n\n\u201cRecord player\u201d is like Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s campaign-killing knockdown of Sen. Marco Rubio at a New Hampshire debate. \u201cThere it is. There it is,\u201d declared Christie onstage. \u201cThe memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.\u201d Rubio and his supporters gamely tried for days to argue that what Christie said didn\u2019t matter. It did. It was over for the Florida Republican. A campaign-slashing branding of \u201crobotic\u201d stuck. Just as \u201crecord player\u201d will.\n\nRead more:\n\nHugh Hewitt: What an awful debate\n\nDavid Byler: Biden\u2019s age is a real issue.
