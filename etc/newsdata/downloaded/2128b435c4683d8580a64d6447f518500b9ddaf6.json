Due to our privacy obligations, we will not comment further,\u201d a department spokesman said in emailed comments.\n\nThe detentions have come amid heightened tension between Western powers and Iran after the United States withdrew from a deal that imposed curbs on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and then imposed sanctions on it, aiming to halt its oil exports.\n\nThe Times said a blogger who had been travelling in Asia with her Australian boyfriend, as well as an academic who had studied at Cambridge University and was lecturing at a university in Australia had been detained in separate incidents.\n\nThey are being held in the same prison in Tehran where a British-Iranian aid worker, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, has been jailed since 2016 on spying charges, the Times said.\n\nThe newspaper did not name the dual British-Australians at the request of the British Foreign Office and said the Australian government was taking the lead in both cases.\n\nThe Australian government\u2019s official travel advice for Iran overall is for people to reconsider the need to travel to Iran \u201cdue to the risk that foreigners, including Australians, could be arbitrarily detained or arrested. Dual nationals are also at risk\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t guarantee access to consular services or legal representation if you\u2019re detained or arrested,\u201d the government says.\n\nThe Times said the blogger was arrested about 10 weeks ago with her boyfriend.\n\nIt was unclear when or why the lecturer was arrested, the Times said. She is being held in solitary confinement and has been sentenced to 10 years, according to a source cited by the Times.", "description": "Three Australian citizens have been detained in Iran, the Australian government said on Wednesday, adding that it was helping the families of the three but gave no further details.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
