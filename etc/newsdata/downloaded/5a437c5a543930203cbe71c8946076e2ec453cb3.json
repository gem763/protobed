While investigating the new details, the Times found that a similar incident had occurred at Yale between Kavanaugh and another female classmate.\n\nAfter Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school, Ramirez went public with her own accusations. She alleged that during a Yale dorm party, a drunken Kavanaugh exposed his penis and shoved it into her face, causing her to touch it when she tried to push him away. Kavanaugh denied the claims, and was confirmed to the court after the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded that there was \u201cno corroboration of the allegations.\u201d\n\nHowever, during a ten-month investigation, the Times found that Ramirez\u2019s allegations were corroborated by at least seven people, and uncovered a parallel incident that occurred at a different party with another female student. A former Yale classmate named Max Stier says he witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down, and that his friends had pushed his penis into a female student\u2019s hands. As with Ramirez\u2019s incident, it was alleged to have occurred during Kavanaugh\u2019s freshman year. There was no information on the identity of the female student.\n\nStier, who declined to speak with the newspaper, told the FBI and U.S. senators about the incident, but the FBI did not investigate. The Times was able to corroborate Stier\u2019s claims with two officials who spoke to him.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who last year called the accusations against Kavanaugh \u201cfabrications,\u201d continues to support him in light of the new report, and urged him to sue \u201cfor libel.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\u201d\n\nThe report has prompted both calls for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment and a new investigation into the claims. Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar also criticized the FBI\u2019s initial process during an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI think the whole thing was a sham and that those documents need to be turned over as well as the documents that the White House hid from his time in the White House counsel\u2019s office,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI strongly opposed him based on his views on executive power, which will continue to haunt our country, as well as how he behaved, including the allegations that we are hearing more about today,\u201d Klobuchar added.\n\nStay in touch.
