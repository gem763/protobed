The 86-year-old justice said that neither the illness nor the medical care prevented her from doing her famous workouts.\n\n\u201cI do pushups,\u201d she said, according to CNN, adding that she does \u201cboth front and side,\u201d in addition to other exercises with her personal trainer.\n\nThe Supreme Court announced in August that Ginsburg had received three weeks of radiation treatment on a tumor discovered on her pancreas. Doctors reportedly found no other traces of cancer in her body and said no further treatment was necessary.\n\nGinsburg has now been treated for cancer four times since she was appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton. Before this most recent tumor, Ginsburg had two malignant growths removed from her lung.\n\nThe justice regularly exercises, and she continues to surprise critics who might wish her ill health and hope she\u2019s replaced under President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThere was a senator, I think it was after my pancreatic cancer, who announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months,\u201d Ginsburg said in an NPR interview published in July. \u201cThat senator, whose name I have forgotten, is now himself dead, and I am very much alive.\u201d", "description": "The Supreme Court justice said she never stopped exercising through her latest bout with cancer.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daef0652100008821ad3883.jpeg?cache=z0dl6dgloa&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
