We need viable and working municipalities that deliver services to the people,\" added Dodovu.\n\nMolepo said among the concerns was that instability within both municipalities had impaired their ability to spend the municipal infrastructure grant.\n\n\"[The grant] is essential to eradicating infrastructure challenges, especially in rural municipalities. The committee is of the view that the intervention will add the impetus necessary to implement infrastructure programmes.\"\n\nDodovu said the committee would continue to monitor both municipalities.\n\n\"It is upon us as legislators to properly monitor the extent to which these interventions are making a difference in the lives of people.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
