If landlords were found to rent properties to nonresidents, they would be prosecuted under the ordinance.\n\nHowever, because rental applications didn\u2019t collect the information necessary to determine residency, Mr. Kobach emailed then-acting Director of ICE Thomas Homan in 2017 and asked him to check the immigration status of 289 occupancy license applicants.\n\n\u201cThe Fremont ordinance permits the city to share any information on the alien\u2019s application with ICE for ICE\u2019s own purposes,\u201d Mr. Kobach wrote, according to The Kansas City Star.\n\nHe then hinted he would be OK with the information he provided being used for detaining or deporting illegal migrants.\n\n\u201cIf your agents want to use that information for ICE enforcement operations, the ordinance contemplates that,\u201d Mr. Kobach said.\n\nMr. Homan advised Mr. Kobach that making accusations based on an occupancy license was not enough to determine residency, and ICE did nothing with the almost 300 names.\n\nAt the time of the email, Mr. Kobach was still being paid a $10,000-a-month stipend from Fremont, Nebraska. The Kansas Republican defended his ordinance all the way to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and won his case.\n\nAmerican Oversight obtained the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request. Mr. Kobach lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Democrat Laura Kelly in 2018 but is ramping up his Senate run in 2020.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
