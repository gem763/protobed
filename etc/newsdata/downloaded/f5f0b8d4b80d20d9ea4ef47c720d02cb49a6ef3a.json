He was 70. (Michael Lionstar/AP)\n\nJames Atlas, whose biographies of writers Delmore Schwartz and Saul Bellow were both acclaimed and attacked and who, as a publishing executive, ushered dozens of other biographies into print, died Sept. 4 at a hospital in New York City. He was 70.\n\nThe cause was a chronic lung ailment, said his daughter, Molly Atlas.\n\nMr. Atlas gained renown with his first book, \u201cDelmore Schwartz: The Life of an American Poet,\u201d published in 1977, when he was 28. Schwartz, a promising writer in the 1930s and 1940s, was perhaps best known for his evocatively titled short story, \u201cIn Dreams Begin Responsibilities,\u201d written when he was 21.\n\nHandsome, charismatic and the friend of countless literary figures, Schwartz ended up as a down-and-out alcoholic, struggling with mental illness, dead at the age of 52. Drawn to the unfulfilled promise of Schwartz\u2019s life, Mr. Atlas read every word he had written \u2014 even his incoherent scribblings later in life \u2014 and interviewed everyone still alive who had known him.\n\nOne of the people impressed by Mr. Atlas\u2019s biography was Bellow, who had used Schwartz as the basis for the central character in his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1975 novel \u201cHumboldt\u2019s Gift.\u201d After writing a poorly received novel of his own, \u201cThe Great Pretender\u201d (1986), Mr. Atlas decided \u2014 at the suggestion of novelist Philip Roth \u2014 to return to biography and scale the literary mountaintop that was Bellow.\n\nWinner of the Nobel Prize and often proclaimed the greatest novelist of the second half of the 20th century, Bellow was a formidable subject for any biographer \u2014 not the least because he was still alive.\n\nMr. Atlas spent 11 years on his biography, interviewing Bellow and his acquaintances at length and reading his correspondence, before his book was published in 2000. Even then, he had to make last-minute revisions when Bellow, then in his 80s, wrote a new novel and became a father for the fourth time.\n\n\u201cThe biographer enters into a kind of relationship [with his subject] that\u2019s duplicated nowhere else in life,\u201d Mr. Atlas wrote in an introduction to \u201cBellow: A Biography.\u201d \u201cHe becomes an instant confidant, privy to the most intimate secrets, a conduit for unresolved and unexpressed feelings; yet at the same time he\u2019s supposed to remain emotionally distant, formal, objective.\u201d\n\nCritics were wildly divided over Mr. Atlas\u2019s 686-page book.\n\n\u201cA biographer more scrupulous than Atlas is hard to imagine,\u201d critic John Leonard wrote in the New York Times. \u201cI could no more stop reading his biography than I could stop reading Saul Bellow after he blew the blinds off the windows in my head.\u201d\n\nOther reviewers thought it was presumptuous of Mr. Atlas to insert himself into Bellow\u2019s world and, in effect, cast judgment on it.\n\n\u201cTo write a biography of Saul Bellow would be, in a sense, to write my own autobiography, a generation removed,\u201d Mr. Atlas wrote, noting that his parents grew up in the same Jewish immigrant neighborhood in Chicago where Bellow spent his youth.\n\nMr. Atlas was unsparing in his accounts of Bellow\u2019s five marriages and multiple affairs, describing the women in the author\u2019s life as \u201csecondary figures who served his own fantasies of them as providers, entrappers, sexual predators: the Enemy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt becomes clear,\u201d critic James Wood wrote in the New Republic, \u201cthat Atlas is not writing the biography of a freedom-loving mind, of an imagination, but of a seducer, a bad husband, and money-earner who also happened to write some good books.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile working on Bellow\u2019s biography, Mr. Atlas was also a journalist and publishing executive. He developed the idea of publishing a series of short biographies written by notable authors, first under the Penguin Lives imprint and later for his own publishing company.\n\nMr. Atlas matched author and subject \u2014 Larry McMurtry writing about Crazy Horse, Christopher Hitchens on Thomas Jefferson, Bobbie Ann Mason on Elvis Presley \u2014 for biographies of about 150 pages each. The series of more than two dozen books sold hundreds of thousands of copies, with the improbable top seller being Garry Wills\u2019s biography of St. Augustine.\n\n\u201cWriting a biography resembles writing a novel in that you have to solve the problems that present themselves in writing any narrative,\u201d Mr. Atlas said in 2000 in an interview with Humanities, the journal of the National Endowment for the Humanities. \u201cThat is why I claim that biography is an art form, because it involves the same narrative and aesthetic questions. The only difference, I\u2019m tempted to say, is that you\u2019re dealing with fact instead of inventing facts.\u201d\n\nJames Robert Atlas was born March 22, 1949, in Chicago and grew up in Evanston, Ill. His father was a book-loving doctor, his mother a homemaker.\n\nMr. Atlas graduated in 1971 from Harvard University, where he studied with poets Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell, then spent two years as a Rhodes scholar at the University of Oxford. His mentor there was Richard Ellmann, the author of celebrated biographies of James Joyce and Oscar Wilde.\n\n\u201cEllmann\u2019s \u2018Joyce\u2019 didn\u2019t read like a biography: it read like a work of art,\u201d Mr. Atlas wrote in his 2017 book \u201cThe Shadow in the Garden: A Biographer\u2019s Tale.\u201d \u201cIt had the authority of great fiction; it was scholarly but not academic; and behind its facade of objectivity you could detect, if you listened closely enough, the biographer\u2019s own voice. This was the kind of book I aspired to write.\u201d\n\nMr. Atlas moved to New York, intent on becoming a major figure in the city\u2019s literary life. He worked at high-profile publications, including Time magazine, the Atlantic, the New York Times, Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, while writing essays, reviews and his biographies of Schwartz and Bellow.\n\nIn 2005, he published a collection of essays, \u201cMy Life in the Middle Ages,\u201d about the concerns of growing older, including losing his job at the New Yorker when he turned 50.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 44 years, psychiatrist Anna Fels of New York; two children, Molly Atlas of New York and William Atlas of Los Angeles; a brother; and a grandson.\n\nA new biography of Bellow\u2019s early years, by literature professor Zachary Leader, appeared in 2015 and was \u201cso claustrophobic,\u201d Times critic Dwight Garner wrote, that he returned to Mr. Atlas\u2019s book \u201cwith fresh eyes for its best qualities: its human scale, its economies of style, its sense of the sweep of Bellow\u2019s life and its rich understanding of his milieus.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Atlas completed his biography, he said Bellow asked him, \u201cSo what have you learned?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ve learned that you can never know a person.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "He was the author of a controversial biography of Saul Bellow and developed a series of \u201cbrief lives\u201d as a publisher.", "authors": ["Matt Schudel", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bjvZ6Cwt2Ne5QpTx_xwXgO0BI7g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZOYUEGRTAI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
