REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nWashington-based WRI unveiled its new Green Target Tool, which analyzes and compares the world\u2019s 50 largest private banks\u2019 public commitments to address climate and found that as of July, only 23 of the world\u2019s 50 largest private banks made commitments to finance projects for sustainable energy.\n\nAmong those 23 banks with commitments, the average annual level of fossil fuel finance between 2016 and 2018 is nearly twice the annualized amount of sustainable finance commitments. Only seven banks had annualized sustainable finance targets greater than the amount of finance they provide for fossil fuel-related transactions.\n\n\u201cIf banks are serious about sustainability and stepping up to address the climate change challenge, we would expect to see a shift in how their sustainable finance commitments compare with their fossil fuel finance,\u201d said Giulia Christianson, head of sustainable investing at WRI.\n\n\u201cFor now, most banks\u2019 annualized commitments are considerably less than what they provide to fossil fuels on an annual basis.\u201d\n\nBanks have been making sustainable finance commitments for more than a decade but the number of announcements increased in the lead up to the Paris Climate Change summit in 2015 and continues to rise steadily.\n\nUnder pressure from investors, regulators and climate activists, some big banks have acknowledged the role lenders will need to play in a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nLess than less half of the banks with commitments have a common, transparent accounting methodology to report on their progress, Christianson said.\n\nIn the lead up to the United Nations Climate Action Summit last week, a number of banks including ABN Amro (ABNd.AS) and Amalgamated Bank (AMAL.O) announced they will adopt measures to improve the transparency of their investments here to measure their responses to climate change.\n\nAnother group of over 130 banks including Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Citigroup (C.N) and Barclays [BARCR.UL] announced they would adopt United Nations-backed principles for responsible banking here aimed at pushing companies and governments to act quickly to avert catastrophic global warming.\n\n\u201cWe think there is a need for banks to increase their ambition and be a part of the climate change solution and make sure they are designing bold and transparent commitments,\u201d Christianson said.", "description": "Despite pressure from activists, investors and governments, the majority of world's 50 largest banks have not made sustainable finance commitments to respond to the risks of climate change and continue to finance fossil fuels, according to new findings by the World Resources Institute released on Thursday.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436512986&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9208R"}
