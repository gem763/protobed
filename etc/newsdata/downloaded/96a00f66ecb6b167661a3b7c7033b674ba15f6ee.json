We are therefore accelerating plans to remodel them, and move capital into higher growth and return opportunities.'\n\nHis comments follow recent reports claiming Quinn had plans to cut up to 10,000 jobs in a bid to slash costs and stamp his mark on the global banking group.\n\nProfit before tax fell 18 per cent to $4.8billion (\u00a33.7billion) in the third quarter of the year, with overall profits falling by 24 per cent to \u00a33billion. Revenue fell 3 per cent 3 per cent to $13.4billion (\u00a310.4billion).\n\nQuinn said the bank would shift capital away from low-return businesses and further cut costs by simplifying HSBC's management structure.\n\nBut the restructuring is likely to result in 'significant charges' in its fourth quarter of this year, the bank said.\n\nReturn on tangible equity was down more than expected, at 6.4 per cent, with HSBC having to abandon its goal of achieving 11 per cent next year.\n\nShares in HSBC fell by 4 per cent to 592p in morning trading.\n\nRichard Hunter at interactive investor, said: 'Not only are these numbers disappointing and light of expectations, but it seems that things will get worse before they get better.'\n\nHe added: 'Somewhat surprisingly, the performance in the Asian region from which HSBC derives the vast majority of its profits held up well, including a resilient performance (for the moment) from Hong Kong.'\n\nHSBC chief executive Noel Quinn, who became interim chief executive in August after the bank announced the surprise departure of his predecessor John Flint\n\nIn Asia, overall pre-tax profit increased by 4 per cent to $4.7billion (\u00a33.7billion), even though there was an additional $400million (\u00a3312million) charge to potential credit losses arising from the Hong Kong conflict.\n\n'This is hardly an auspicious start for Noel Quinn, who as acting chief executive officer is auditioning for the role on a permanent basis,' said Russ Mould at AJ Bell.\n\n'A renewed restructuring effort is in chain, with the aim of simplifying the business with further details expected at or around the full year results.\n\n'However, along with the herculean task of bringing simplicity to a business as large and complex as HSBC, the bank has no control over factors such as a US-China trade war, Brexit and the escalating political tensions on its home turf in Hong Kong.'", "description": "The boss of HSBC has pledged to speed up plans to 'remodel' the bank as profits fell by nearly 20 per cent amid weakness in Britain, Europe and the US.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
