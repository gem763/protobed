It\u2019s actually funny how things can work out.\n\nHad those at Borussia Dortmund - including Klopp himself - decided to stick amid the struggles of the 2014-15 season, and not felt a change was so necessary, Liverpool might never have encountered this glorious new era.\n\nIt might have been the Bundesliga club enjoying another spell of glory. Because, as rightfully admired as Dortmund are for their intelligence in the continuation of an exciting approach first instilled by Klopp, they have still only won one trophy - the 2017 DFB Pokal - in the time since he left. They\u2019ve often been sensational sure, but it\u2019s felt a level down from what Klopp was capable of.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to blame anyone, of course. The fair feeling at the time was that everyone was just exhausted. Which sounds familiar.\n\nBut it also points to something that has now been almost entirely exhausted in the modern game: no one gets the chance to build again.\n\nIt feels like you get one cycle\u2026 and that\u2019s it.\n\nThe general truth in football, uttered by pretty much everyone in the game, is that \u201cwhen it goes, it goes\u201d. When a team reaches breaking point, that's it.\n\nAnd that has been seen with virtually every manager and every team in football. It similarly conforms to Bela Gutmann\u2019s rule of the third season being \u201cfatal\u201d and Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s firm belief that a three- or four-year cycle is the most you can have with any one group. That isn\u2019t because of any mathematical clock in the sky, but because of the inevitable mental effect of working with the same people for so long.\n\nBut this is what is key. Why not reverse it, and give a proven manager time to rebuild? Why not give him the two years or so you would usually allow a new manager who comes in - and that Klopp pretty much got when he arrived at Anfield?\n\nThat, after all, has pretty much been the story of every turnaround. Clubs have taken the decision to hit pause, to be patient.\n\nSome of the most instructive of those stories have come from Liverpool. Both Bill Shankly, in the early 1970s, and Bob Paisley, around 1981, endured serious drop-offs in the level of title-winning squads. One of those, in 1980-81, even involved a run to a European Cup final. Both were ultimately given the space to create a new team.\n\nPrecious few of those stories, however, come from the Premier League era.\n\nThis is indicated by the rather stark fact that, of all the managers in the competition\u2019s history who took a job after the 1992 landmark - so excluding Sir Alex Ferguson, George Graham and Brian Clough - Pochettino is the eighth longest serving, at five years and five months.\n\nThat in itself is remarkable, and points to how rare it is for managers to get a second go.\n\nThis, it should be said, isn\u2019t a plea for patience in the way we hear any time a new manager is struggling. The overwhelming majority won\u2019t prove to be Ferguson.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about new managers. It\u2019s about proven managers, and those like Pochettino who remain at the very forefront of the modern game.\n\nIt is even rarer, with them, that they don\u2019t succeed when given that chance to build a second team. Pretty much all the greats have. It\u2019s why they do what they do.\n\nMany might argue here that Pochettino doesn\u2019t deserve to be put in such a category since he hasn\u2019t won anything, but that\u2019s something else that is genuinely different in the modern game. The Argentine - as should barely need saying by now - has raised Spurs to standards of performance that should not be possible for a club of their resources. He has worked wonders. He has turned them into a Champions League contender, with Daniel Levy to be fair fully building on that with the construction of a truly Champions League stadium.\n\nThat was never going to be indefinitely sustainable, especially not with a team where many key players are the wrong side of their prime. Pochettino knew this as early as 2017, but the club\u2019s economic restrictions have prevented him from acting upon it in the way Ferguson - or Shankly, or Paisley, or Sir Matt Busby - would have.\n\nIt is why the club should overlook what is a standard process in football, in the decline of one group of players together, and continue to invest in something special.\n\nThere is a proven way out of this, tough as it seems right now.\n\nFor his part, Levy is well aware of it. He knows Pochettino better than anyone, bar assistant Jesus Perez. More coldly, he also knows the price of getting rid of the Argentine, and getting in a new manager. There would be no guarantees there either. There may be a similar waiting period, especially if you make the wrong choice. Just look at what has happened with Unai Emery at Arsenal.\n\nThe feeling among some at Spurs is that results will start to right themselves once the new players - like Tanguy Ndombele, like Giovani Lo Celso - fully attune and get up to speed, which would also give more licence to drop the want-away players.\n\nThat could see things start to turn properly.\n\nUntil then, and especially this weekend, patience may be required.
