I'm freaking out, I'm getting my first wave of bad press, what do I do?'\"\n\nHer advice: Keep making art. Swift says she tells people who ask her for advice to not pay much attention to the scrutiny and to continue doing what you love. She says given the media industry, it's inevitable that you'll get critiqued.\n\n\"When I was like 23 and people were just kind of reducing me to, kind of making slideshows of my dating life and putting people in there that I'd sat next to at a party once and deciding that my songwriting was like a trick rather than a skill and a craft,\" Swift said.\n\nMore: Taylor Swift to be honored with artist of the decade award at next month's AMAs\n\nWhen people minimized her artistic skill and success in that way, it was a form of slut-shaming, she said.\n\n\"It's a way to take a woman who's doing her job and succeeding at doing her job and making things. And in a way, it's figuring out how to completely minimize that skill by taking something that everyone in their darkest, darkest moments loves to do, which is just to slut shame.\"", "description": "Taylor Swift wants to be known for her success not her dating history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/30/USAT/c7be9d1d-b515-460c-aa1e-36ce2b1e843d-AP_People-Taylor_Swift.JPG?crop=2959,1664,x0,y0&width=2288&height=1664&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
