Hundreds and hundreds of tents and people living at the entrance to their office building.\"\n\nTrump also claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that police officers who patrol areas with large concentrations of homeless people are \"getting sick\" and \"going to the hospital,\" adding, \"We can't let that happen.\"\n\nRead more: The Trump administration says 'humane policing' could be used to reduce homelessness\n\nIn a newly-released White House report, Council of Economic Advisers acting chairman Tomas Philipson cited \"humane policing\" as a tool to reduce the number of homeless people on the streets while not clarifying exactly what \"humane\" law enforcement activity would entail. Advocates for the homeless, however, counter that criminalizing homelessness or moving them into government buildings are likely to be unconstitutional and cruel, as well as counterproductive.\n\nTrump has frequently weaponized homelessness and crime to insult and criticize the leadership of cities in liberal states like California, and his administration is now trying to partner with local officials in California to tackle the issue.\n\nOn September 10, the Post, citing anonymous government officials, reported that the Trump administration was considering federal measures that included, among other things \"razing existing tent camps for the homeless\" and plans to \"move homeless people into \"government-backed facilities.\"\n\nThe Post said that top Trump administration officials from the White House and various federal agencies have traveled to California to meet with local officials, further reporting that the group of officials toured a former Federal Aviation Administration facility as a possible site that could house homeless people.\n\nCritics are warning, however, that criminalizing homelessness is a counterproductive strategy, and the administration's reported plans to move the homeless into government facilities and engage in \"humane policing\" may not be legal or practical.\n\n\"Not only is criminalization of homelessness unconstitutional and cruel, it wastes public resources that should otherwise be spent on solutions,\" National Low Income Housing Coalition director Diane Yentel told Markets Insider.", "description": "The Washington Post has previously reported that the Trump administration is looking for ways the federal government can reduce homelessness.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8139b92e22af50e45af772-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
