Having left home as children and finding only closed doors as they ventured thousands of miles by land, air and sea, they have finally found a home in Texas.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were never welcomed anywhere before,\u201d Ataie said. \u201cBut we were welcomed here.\u201d\n\nThey have even become part of the family for Holly Walsh, an Iowa-born, Mississippi-raised flight attendant who the young men affectionately call \u201cmom.\u201d She, in turn, treats them as sons.\n\nAnimosity toward refugees \u201chas been in my face plenty of times, with people saying \u2018Why are you bringing these terrorist-cell groups into our country?\u2019 \u201d said Walsh, who is one of the Dallas area\u2019s most active volunteers in helping refugees to resettle.\n\n\u201cI say, \u2018Let me just tell you about my boys.\u2019 I mean, how can you not love my boys?\u201d\n\nA 15,000-mile journey\n\nRefugees detained on the Manus and Nauru islands weren\u2019t criminals, as Trump had assumed. But they were treated like they were, held for years amid wretched conditions as a warning to others not to follow their lead.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTheir origins trace a wide swath of the globe, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Somalia and Myanmar. But they shared a common destination: Australia, where they had intended to escape from war, oppression or poverty.\n\nThe Australian government disrupted those plans in 2013, enacting a policy of forbidding asylum arrivals by sea. Instead, those arrivals were sent to Manus and Nauru \u2014 tiny islands far from the mainland \u2014 and told they would never be allowed to settle in Australia.\n\nThe government insisted the policy was meant to discourage dangerous boat journeys that enriched smugglers and cost asylum seekers their lives. Human rights groups countered that it was a cruel measure fueled by xenophobia.\n\nAD\n\nThe policy change came as the Alis were already en route.\n\nThe pair shared much: Both were teenage, firstborn sons whose families opted to send them abroad rather than keep them in a country where they faced ethnic persecution and a war without end. But they had never met in their native Afghanistan.\n\nAD\n\nThey each set off alone. First to India, then Malaysia, then Indonesia. A harrowing days-long sea journey in a rusty fishing boat packed to twice its capacity brought them to Australia\u2019s Christmas Island and, they thought, their new lives.\n\nBut instead of entry to Australia, they were given a one-way ticket to Nauru \u2014 an eight-square-mile nation in the Pacific. The rocky land had been long since exhausted by strip mining, and with few other resources to offer, converted into a detention center for Australia\u2019s unwanted migrants.\n\n\u201cWe had gone through all of these countries, gone through the ocean. And then we were in prison,\u201d said Ataie, who was 15 years old when his journey began. \u201cIt was the most terrible situation of my life.\u201d\n\nDespite sweltering temperatures, the detainees were housed in overcrowded tents. They were each given two minutes to shower, and addressed by staff with an alphanumeric code, rather than their names. As desperation grew, some detainees sewed their lips shut in protest. Others committed suicide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverything I had heard indicated that the situation was very grim,\u201d said Anne Richard, who was then the Obama administration\u2019s point person for refugee policy.\n\nAs Obama\u2019s presidency came to an end in late 2016, and as the global population of displaced people swelled to record numbers, the administration was looking for ways to accept more refugees. It also wanted to encourage other nations to do the same.\n\nRichard struck a deal with the Australians that fall that was intended to accomplish both: The United States would accept up to 1,250 refugees from Nauru and Manus if the Australians took in more people from other parts of the globe.\n\nIn Nauru, the deal offered a rare dose of hope.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs soon as I heard about it, I signed up,\u201d Hesar said.\n\nAtaie was more skeptical. He wasn\u2019t sure the United States would actually follow through.\n\nAD\n\nThen Trump was elected, and the transcript of his combative call with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull was published in The Washington Post.\n\nObama\u2019s agreement, Trump told his Australian counterpart, was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d What if the next Boston marathon bomber was among the refugees, he asked?\n\n\u201cThey are not going to be wonderful people,\u201d the president fumed before abruptly ending the call.\n\nAcross the globe, in Nauru, a familiar despair returned.\n\n\u201cI stopped dreaming about what life would look like in the United States,\u201d Ataie said.\n\nAD\n\nBut both Alis kept going with a process for screening refugees that Trump had dubbed \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d In interviews, every moment of their lives was reconstructed. The investigators homed in on possible inconsistencies. Medical and background checks followed.\n\nAD\n\nAfter more than a year, they got approval. But they still didn\u2019t know for sure that Trump would let them in.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018We\u2019re either going to be the luckiest people because we\u2019ll get out, or the unluckiest because we\u2019ll have everything done and then we\u2019ll sit in Nauru,\u2019 \u201d Ataie said.\n\n\u201cEven when they gave us a flight date, we were like, \u2018Is it going to happen?\u2019 \u201d Hesar added.\n\nOn Feb. 11 last year, they left Nauru for the first time in four years. Under intense pressure from the Australians to uphold the agreement \u2014 \u201ca deal is a deal,\u201d Turnbull had told Trump \u2014 the president had relented.\n\n'Welcome to Dallas'\n\nAtaie and Hesar had educated themselves about Texas by watching vintage cowboy movies. When they landed in Dallas, they were astonished: Not a 10-gallon hat to be seen, nor any boots with spurs. No horses, even.\n\nAD\n\nWhen they ordered sodas at KFC, the cup was so large they could scarcely wrap their hands around it. A visit to Walmart left them speechless, awed by the scale. But a smile and a few words from the checkout clerk reassured them.\n\n\u201cWelcome to America,\u201d she said upon learning they were newly arrived refugees.\n\nThey had heard in Nauru that some Americans dislike foreigners. But they said they have never experienced hostility firsthand.\n\n\u201cWhen people hear that we\u2019ve been to several countries, they say, \u2018Oh, what\u2019s it like there?\u2019 They find it interesting,\u201d Ataie said.\n\nStill, Ataie and Hesar do their best to fit in and not call attention to their outsider status. During their first few weeks in America, they walked everywhere. Passing motorists would slow down and stare, confused by the sight of pedestrians. Some even stopped to ask if they were ok.\n\nNow, like the Texans they\u2019re fast becoming, they drive everywhere, even if it\u2019s just to the gym two blocks from their apartment, a comfortable and spotless three-bedroom that they share with three other Afghans.\n\nAt work, they don\u2019t talk with colleagues about the fact that they\u2019re refugees. They want to be known for their professionalism, not for their past.\n\nTheir job \u2014 doing quality control for an exhibits company \u2014 has them up before dawn. They often work late. When Ataie gets home, he spends hours online studying for a degree in cybersecurity.\n\nNew refugee arrivals have to find a job fast because the support from the local resettlement office doesn\u2019t last long: just three months before they need to become self-sufficient.\n\n\u201cWhen they get here it\u2019s, \u2018Welcome to Dallas. Here\u2019s your welcome meal.\u2019 And the first thing they ask is, \u2018When can I start looking for work?\u2019 \u201d said Jacqueline Buzas, who coordinates refugee arrivals for the Dallas office of Refugee Services of Texas.\n\nThe newcomers from Nauru and Manus have had little apparent trouble finding jobs. Jenny Leahy, an Australian aid worker who lived on Nauru, visited dozens of them in the United States last month \u2014 from San Diego to New York. All were supporting themselves, a fact consistent with studies showing that refugees generate far more in government revenue, through employment and entrepreneurship, than they cost in state services.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hard workers, and they\u2019re the most honest, generous and considerate people you could ever hope to meet,\u201d she said as she sipped tea with the Alis at their apartment. \u201cIt breaks my heart that they\u2019re not in Australia. Who wouldn\u2019t want them as neighbors?\u201d\n\nIn the Dallas area, plenty of people do. Buzas said that even as U.S. policy moves toward a more restrictive stance toward refugees, the response in the Dallas community has trended the opposite way. \u201cI\u2019m flooded by people interested in helping,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong those who have been inspired to assist is Walsh. As a flight attendant, she travels the world. But it\u2019s in her adopted hometown where she has forged connections with people from Congo, Iraq, Myanmar and well beyond.\n\n\u201cI put myself in their shoes: What if it were me having to go to another country because I couldn\u2019t go home?\u201d said Walsh, whose pilot husband and teenage daughter have also become avid volunteers. \u201cThey really blow me away. They can come here with nothing and rebuild their life. These are people with superpowers.\u201d\n\nShe and the Alis regularly visit each other for meals. They share holiday and birthday celebrations, along with confidences and jokes.\n\nEarly on, she offered occasional guidance \u2014 how to buy a car, where to shop. But after awhile, they didn\u2019t need much help.\n\nSo when her phone rang early one spring morning, she knew something was wrong. Their apartment was flooding, they told her in a panic. She was rushing to call the plumber when they revealed their discovery of a great American tradition: \u201cApril Fool\u2019s!\u201d\n\nEven as they adapt to their new lives, their old ones retain a magnetic pull. They video-chat regularly with their families in Afghanistan, and worry about relatives left behind.\n\nWith the Trump administration admitting so few refugees \u2014 a move justified by the need to focus on asylum seekers arriving at the southern border \u2014 any prospect that their families might join them in the United States has grown more remote. And with the war still raging, a return to Afghanistan is out of the question.\n\nIn the meantime, they do what they can to keep alive their memories of home. That included a trip to an Afghan restaurant on one recent evening, their first since they left the country.\n\nSet in a lonely strip mall where Texan suburbia meets undeveloped prairie-land, the restaurant featured tables decorated with baseball cards and comic strips \u2014 a dash of Americana in an establishment serving up specialties from central Asia.\n\n\u201cMy mouth is watering already,\u201d said Hesar as he pored over a menu stocked with savory beef dumplings known as mantu and delicate potato-filled flatbreads called bolani.\n\n\u201cRemember when we tried to make bolani at our place?\u201d asked Ataie, laughing. \u201cWe had to take down the smoke alarms.\u201d\n\nThe pair have been teaching themselves how to cook Afghan food via YouTube videos. But they\u2019re not sure how well their training has worked.\n\nAtaie imagined how the family he hasn\u2019t seen since he was a teen might respond if he ever gets the chance to cook for them: \u201cYou\u2019ve been eating this?\u201d\n\nThe refugee population on Nauru is now dwindling, and new arrivals have slowed. But last week, one of the Alis\u2019 last friends there became the latest to land in America.\n\nWalsh brought her homemade welcome sign. Ataie wore a black T-shirt with \u201cStraight Outta Nauru\u201d emblazoned across the front. Three others who had traveled the unlikely path to Dallas, via a detour in the South Pacific, joined in.\n\nNo one mentioned the news, only hours old, that fewer refugees will be resettled in the United States next year than at any time since 1980.\n\nFor long minutes after the flight landed, there was no sign of the newcomer. But then he emerged, smiling, weary from his travels and apologizing for the delay. Jafar Alizada had gotten lost after landing, and came through the wrong door.\n\nHis friends hugged him and helped him with his bag \u2014 an average-sized backpack, not even full. They had much to discuss: Alizada\u2019s journey, the latest news from Nauru, life in America.
