Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in 2008, moderator Bernard Shaw of CNN began by asking this question:\n\n\u201cGovernor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\u201d\n\nMr. Dukakis coolly answered, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, Bernard, and I think you know that I\u2019ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don\u2019t see any evidence that it\u2019s a deterrent and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.\u201d\n\nThen he recited some crime statistics.\n\nThe debate and the election were pretty much over. Americans did not want a president unable to muster even a little outrage at the thought of his own wife being ravaged and killed.\n\nToday, we\u2019re witnessing a similar moment for our cultural elites. They\u2019re being cool and calm in the face of something that cries out for moral outrage.\n\nBirthed in San Francisco in 2015, Drag Queen Story Hour has its own website and is now found all over the nation. It is perhaps the most potent image for what\u2019s gone wrong in America.\n\nThe far-left American Library Association last year sponsored a workshop for librarians on how to stage them. This is called aiding and abetting.\n\nNot long ago, a sexually confused man in women\u2019s clothing peddling homosexual propaganda to small children would have prompted calls to the police.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s cool to be neutral or even applaud. You\u2019ve heard of virtue signaling? This is it in spades. The question is, where\u2019s the outrage?\n\nThe only real pushback has come from MassResistance, the Bay State-based group that has opened chapters in other states and leads protests against this abomination.\n\nLeaving no doubt about their agenda, the Drag Queen Story Hour (DQSH) website explains that this is \u201cjust what it sounds like \u2014 drag queens reading stories to children in libraries, schools, and bookstores. DQSH captures the imagination and play of the gender fluidity of childhood and gives kids glamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t want to bring your 4-year-old to this? What are you, a hater?\n\nAnd what about the smiling moms and dads at these events? I guess we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that there are parents willing to sacrifice their children on the altar of political correctness. America has racked up 60 million abortions since 1973.\n\nKaiser Permanente has created a TV ad titled \u201cTo Them We Say.\u201d The ad features various people who are called \u201ctoo fat,\u201d \u201ctoo skinny,\u201d \u201ctoo old,\u201d etc. Then it shows a man in drag reading and dancing for children, who are laughing with delight.\n\nThe voiceover proclaims, \u201c \u2026 to them we say \u2018too bad.\u2019 At Kaiser Permanente, we believe everybody deserves the right to thrive.\u201d Who knew that corrupting children sexually was a way to thrive?\n\nGetting back to the theme of under-reaction, a major newspaper carried an opinion piece last Thursday about a Drag Queen Story Hour. It was accompanied online by a photo of \u201cLil Miss Hot Mess,\u201d who appeared at a library in New York.\n\nThe author has done so much fine work for years that I\u2019m loathe to pick on her. Maybe she thought the facts were shocking enough. But the tone of the piece epitomizes the general reluctance to openly express moral outrage.\n\nWatching the children, she observed: \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell what was going on inside those small heads, of course. Perhaps they were shy, or bored. Perhaps some of them were too young. Or perhaps Venus and her 6-inch eyelashes terrified them. Heavy stage makeup can look flattering under stage lights, but in ordinary indoor daylight the effect can be more Medusa than goddess of love. \u2026\n\n\u201cStill, drag is a time-honored form of comic entertainment, from the Greek stage to RuPaul. Perhaps if the drag queens toned it down and positioned themselves less as \u2018queer role models\u2019 and more as comedians in the Milton Berle tradition, they\u2019d be less off-putting.\u201d\n\nReally? We\u2019re talking here about preschoolers and kindergarteners. Apart from the effect on their innocent souls, some of these kids may go on to develop gender dysphoria and be \u201ctreated\u201d with puberty-blocking drugs. Some may even, tragically, have healthy body parts surgically removed and regret it when it\u2019s too late.\n\nThe whole thing is insane, immoral and should elicit more than Dukakis-style neutrality and societal co-dependence. We\u2019re supposed to be kind to delusional people and get them help, not turn them into role models for young children.\n\nI\u2019ll end with a quote from Laurie Higgins of the Illinois Family Policy Center, who pulls no punches.\n\n\u201cAccording to \u2018progressives,\u2019 homosexuality \u2014 for which there is zero evidence of biochemical causation \u2014 is immutable, but sex \u2014 which is proven to be genetically determined \u2014 is mutable and can be changed via a new wardrobe and a few (or many) surgical snips.\u201d\n\nAnd, she adds, they demand \u201ccompulsory participation of the entire culture in an elaborate performance piece \u2026 a toxic retelling of the \u2018Emperor\u2019s New Clothes.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnly this time, the king is wearing a wig, heavy makeup and a sequined gown.\n\n\u2022 Robert Knight is a contributor to The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
