Turns out that number is $7 billion, or just over 3% of its current coffers.\n\nWith the 30-year Treasury at record lows, many companies have been able to borrow more cheaply for much longer. Apple will pay around 2.99% interest on its new 30-year bonds, compared with the 3.45% it\u2019s paying on three-decade bonds it sold in 2015. On a $1.5 billion issue, that equates to savings of nearly $7 million of interest annually, or more than $200 million over the course of three decades.\n\nToday\u2019s debt sale could help Apple refinance roughly $2 billion of debt that\u2019s scheduled to mature this year in addition to much of the $10 billion it has coming due in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The borrowing is profitable for the company\u2019s shareholders by at least one measure: the company\u2019s earnings yield, a measure of how much the company earns relative to its share price, is around 5.6%, while it can borrow for 30 years for less than 3%.\n\nApple\u2019s not the only one seizing this golden opportunity. A record 21 U.S. investment-grade companies tapped the market Tuesday, borrowing a combined $27 billion. With more than a dozen deals in the works Wednesday, this week\u2019s issuance is already set to hit $54 billion, comfortably surpassing dealer estimates of $40 billion.\n\n(Updates with earnings yield in paragraph four.)\n\n--With assistance from Luke Kawa.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Molly Smith in New York at msmith604@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Allan Lopez, Dan Wilchins\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., one of the most cash-rich companies in the world, is still looking to get a piece of the ultra-cheap money that\u2019s up for grabs in the bond market.With investment-grade bond yields hovering near record lows, it\u2019s tempting even for Apple -- with more than $200 billion of cash", "authors": ["Molly Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}
