Col. Alexander Vindman, a national security council official who will meet behind closed doors with lawmakers on Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call 'concerned' today\u2019s Never Trumper witness,\" Trump tweeted. \"Was he on the same call that I was?

Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nIn another tweet, Trump questioned \"How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify\" and asked \"why so many\" people were listening in on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe president repeatedly urged his followers on Tuesday to read a White House rough transcript of the call, which was released in September. The document shows Trump urging Zelensky to look into a company with ties to the Russia investigation and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden Joe BidenJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry Army officer twice reported concerns about Trump's Ukraine tactics Ex-Trump official's refusal to testify escalates impeachment tensions MORE.\n\nVindman on Tuesday will become the first official who was on the call to testify. He will tell lawmakers that he was troubled by Trump urging Zelensky to investigate a rival and reported it to his supervisor, worrying that the president's conduct threatened to undermine U.S. national security, according to a copy of his opening statement obtained by The Hill.\n\nVindman is a Ukrainian-American immigration and received the Purple Heart for his service in Iraq.\n\nThe July 25 call, a whistleblower complaint about the conversation and testimony from several administration officials have formed the basis of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. The House is scheduled to vote this week to formalize the inquiry and lay out rules to govern the process.\n\nRepublicans and White House allies have spent recent weeks hammering Democrats over transparency and questioning the legitimacy of the impeachment inquiry without a formal vote. But in light of Democrats agreeing to hold such a vote, the president's backers have shifted their message.\n\nTrump on Tuesday retweeted dozens of messages from Republican lawmakers and conservative voices blasting the process as a \"sham\" and disputing that holding a formal vote at this point in the process changes that.\n\n\"A vote now is a bit like un-Ringing a bell as House Democrats have selectively leaked information in order to damage President @realDonaldTrump for weeks,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamMurkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution There is no prize in Syria for the US McConnell, McCarthy not notified ahead of Baghdadi raid MORE (R-S.C.) tweeted in one message shared by Trump.\n\n\"Codifying a sham process halfway through doesn\u2019t make it any less of a sham process,\" Rep. Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanEx-Trump official's refusal to testify escalates impeachment tensions Why the GOP march of mad hatters poses a threat to our Democracy Elijah Cummings, native son of Baltimore, gets emotional send-off from Democratic luminaries MORE (R-Ohio) said in another message the president retweeted.\n\nWhile Republicans have largely focused their complaints on process, Trump has fixated on the substance of the investigation and repeatedly denied wrongdoing.\n\n\"I'd rather go into the details of the case rather than process,\" Trump said Monday. \"Process is good. But I think you ought to look at the case. And the case is very simple. It's quick. It's so quick.\"\n\nThe president's insistence that he has done nothing wrong puts Republicans in a difficult spot, particularly in the Senate, where some GOP lawmakers have been hesitant to defend Trump's actions.\n\nMost Republican senators backed a resolution last week condemning the impeachment inquiry against President Trump and calling on the House to hold a formal vote on the inquiry. But the document largely focused on process, and a few key senators have yet to sign onto it in support.", "description": "President Trump on Tuesday railed against the impeachment inquiry into his alleged abuse of power ahead of key testimony from a White House official that threatens to deepen the president's problems.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_102519upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
