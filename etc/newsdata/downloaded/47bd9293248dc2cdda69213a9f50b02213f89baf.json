I've used many InvisibleShield tempered glass protectors on my devices over the years and trust them to keep my glass displays safe and scratch free.\n\nThe retail package includes everything you need to install the protector along with the glass panel and a matte finish polycarbonate bumper. You can purchase this package for $49.99 in black, gold, or silver. I tested out the black model.\n\nThe smooth tempered glass is designed to protect your display while it is curved to fit perfectly on your Apple Watch screen. ZAGG provides a full screen adhesive so that touch sensitivity is enhanced.\n\nAfter some initial installation challenges, and ensuing patience, I have been enjoying a flawless experience with this screen protector.", "description": "Wearing your Apple Watch daily means it is out there exposed to contact with various objects so it's not bad insurance to protect that display with a glass protector. ZAGG also includes a bumper to protect the edges of the Apple Watch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/05/3f390f78-19a1-4129-abb5-6eff4a2bcb6f/thumbnail/770x578/58ba0e406ac1702d5f1e25c951e81c86/aw-invisibleshield-glass-360-8.jpg"}
