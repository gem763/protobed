Two attendees bid $80,000 each for Paltrow's prize.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow was 'determined' to help bring down Weinstein, according to new book\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/11/gwyneth-paltrow-amfar-los-angeles-courage/3940817002/", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow accepted an Award of Courage at the amfAR Gala in Los Angeles for being a staunch supporter of AIDS research.
