The company had logged its best day in three decades on Friday after reporting strong results.\n\nNike Inc advanced 1.1% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded the sportswear maker's stock to \"neutral\" from \"underperform.\".\n\nConstruction and engineering company AECOM gained 6.3% after agreeing to sell its management services unit to private equity firms for about $2.4 billion.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.57-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 24 new highs and 123 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 4.73 billion shares, compared with the 6.86 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
