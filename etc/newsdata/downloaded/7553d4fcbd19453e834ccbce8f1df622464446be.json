Meanwhile, traders are also paying attention to potential supply disruptions in Ecuador and continued worries over global growth prospects.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery CLX19, -0.08% on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 48 cents, or 0.9%, to $53.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. December Brent crude BRNZ19, +0.17% was up 40 cents, or 0.7%, at $58.64 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported that U.S. crude supplies climbed for a fourth week in a row, by 2.9 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 4. They were forecast to increase by 2.4 million barrels, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported a rise of 4.1 million barrels, according to sources.\n\n\u201cA drop in refining activity to the lowest level since mid-February has yielded a build to oil inventories, despite lowly net imports,\u201d said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. \u201cWe are in the depths of fall maintenance, but both strong exports and weak imports have helped limit the build.\u201d\n\nThe EIA data showed supply declines of 1.2 million barrels for gasoline and 3.9 million barrels for distillates. The S&P Global Platts survey revealed expectations for supply declines of 1.2 million barrels for gasoline and 2.5 million barrels for distillates.\n\n\u201cThe market took notice of a modest build in crude supplies, but the crude inventory build was more than offset by a significantly greater draw of products, such that the overall inventory declined by 8.3 million barrels,\u201d Manish Raj, chief financial officer at Velandera Energy Partners, told MarketWatch. \u201cThis sign of tightening overall inventory is supporting the oil price.\u201d\n\nRead: EIA cuts global oil demand expectations, lowers oil-price forecasts\n\nOn Nymex, November gasoline RBX19, +0.44% rose 0.7% to $1.5913 a gallon, while November heating oil HOX19, +0.52% was up 0.7% at $1.9231 a gallon.\n\n\u201cOther than inventory, the market is also interested in the level of U.S. crude oil production, which at 12.6 million barrels a day, has grown to the highest level of all time,\u201d said Raj. \u201cThe rising U.S. production is keeping [a lid] on the prices, which would otherwise be seeking a higher level.\u201d\n\nRounding out action in the energy markets, November natural gas NGX19, -2.36% shed 0.7% to $2.272 per million British thermal units. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts, on average, expect the EIA on Thursday to report a weekly rise of 97 billion cubic feet in U.S natural-gas supplies in storage.\n\nRead: EIA expects U.S. winter heating bills to be lower than last year\u2019s\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. benchmark stock indexes climbed Wednesday , feeding risk-on sentiment that aided oil\u2019s rise, after Bloomberg News reported that China was open to a limited resolution, while the Financial Times reported that China has offered to boost purchases of U.S. agricultural products.

Protesters seized some oil installations and Petroecuador, the state oil company, has warned that losses could reach 165,000 barrels a day \u2014 nearly a third of production, if unrest continues.\n\nEcuador announced earlier this month that it will leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Jan. 1, 2020 as its government seeks ways to boost revenue.", "description": "Oil futures trade higher Wednesday, holding onto the bulk of earlier gains on the back of optimism over U.S.-China trade negotiations, as the U.S. government...", "authors": ["Myra P.
