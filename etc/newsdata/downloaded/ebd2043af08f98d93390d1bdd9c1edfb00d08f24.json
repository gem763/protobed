The barbaric attack left eight people dead and injured seven Sri Lankan players and staff. Since the incident, international cricket has avoided the country with no high-profile team visiting it for a full-length tour. The upcoming six-match series of T20 and ODI matches scheduled to begin from Sept. 27 is Pakistan\u2019s attempt to resurface in the international cricket scene.\n\nIn a meeting held with the preliminary team selected to play in Pakistan, players were assured that appropriate security arrangements would be made but were also given the option to opt out. Other players who \u201cchose to stay away\u201d from the series include Thisara Perera, Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Kusal Perera, Dhananjaya de Silva, Akila Dananjaya, Suranga Lakmal, and Dinesh Chandimal.\n\nThe international community has often accused Pakistan of fuelling terrorism, including The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international watchdog for terror financing which believes Pakistan is funding terror activities. However, while Prime Minister Imran Khan admits that there are over 30,000 terrorists in the country, he maintains that the government is a victim, not a propagator.\n\nMeanwhile, Sri Lanka\u2019s Sports Minister Harin Fernando is refusing to let the Sri Lankan team play two Test matches against Pakistan in the latter country, instead urging the the United Arab Emirates to be the venue for longer Test matches.\n\nFollow Shamani Joshi on Instagram.", "description": "After the 2009 terror attack on the team in Lahore, top players, including Lasith Malinga and ODI captain Dimuth Karunaratne, are fearful of stepping into the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d776ea065aef1000a3e0f00/lede/1568108280835-Sri-Lanka-cricket-players-refuse-to-go-to-Pakistan-over-security-concerns.png?crop=1xw:0.9710789766407119xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
