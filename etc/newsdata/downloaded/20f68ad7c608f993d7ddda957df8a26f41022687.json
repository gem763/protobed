It was a spontaneous thing.\u201d\n\nJones, who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Theory of Everything,\u201d said reuniting with Redmayne - who won an Oscar for the movie - \u201cfelt really natural.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the thing that pushed it was that the parts were so good,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, if one of us had read it and one part hadn\u2019t been good, it would it would never have worked. But they were both brilliantly written. They were both parts that we were ready to do at that moment. And I think it made it feel more of an adventure coming back together and it made the film feel like it was part of some kind of a narrative in some way, obviously pivoting from \u2018Theory of Everything.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the true story, Jones plays pilot Amelia Wren, while Redmayne portrays scientist James Glaisher, who find themselves in an epic fight for survival as they attempt to discover how high they can rise in a hot-air balloon in the 1800s. Redmayne and Jones walked the red carpet Sunday for the film\u2019s world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nRedmayne said their previous connection made it easier to film \u201cThe Aeronauts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird thing when you start a film because you meet people you don\u2019t know often and then you have to play very closely and intimately with them sort of instantaneously. And this film demanded by its essence, the fact that it\u2019s two people for a portion of the film in this basket, a huge amount of closeness,\u201d he said.\n\nThe film opens in the United Kingdom on Nov. 6 before its U.S. release on Dec. 6.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As soon as Eddie Redmayne read the script for \"The Aeronauts,\" he knew whom his co-star should be: His \"Theory of Everything\" co-star Felicity Jones.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Carucci"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/people-redmayne-jones_55828_c0-176-3402-2159_s1770x1032.jpg?be1dbed20e2b4c7743b9044f722268809a4c994c", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
