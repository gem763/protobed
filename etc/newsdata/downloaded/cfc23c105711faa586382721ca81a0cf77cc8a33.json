Pineda represents a discount from those options, setting him up for a better \u201cper dollar\u201d fantasy performance. It doesn\u2019t hurt that he\u2019s facing the lowly Tigers, who rank last in wRC+ with the highest strikeout rate in baseball. You could argue that Pineda has been the best pitcher in Minnesota\u2019s rotation lately, and I\u2019m expecting another quality showing from the big right-hander.\n\nAlso Consider: Justin Verlander, Patrick Corbin\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nTrey Mancini - Baltimore (at Kansas City)\n\nStory continues\n\nKansas City LHP Danny Duffy has been very inconsistent this season, and he\u2019ll take the bump for the first time in nearly a month after dealing with a hamstring issue. The Royals southpaw allowed 12 earned runs through 10.2 innings across two starts prior to landing on the injured list. He could show some rust in this afternoon\u2019s draw against the Orioles, and Trey Mancini will look to jump on the platoon advantage. Mancini is swinging a confident bat with three multi-hit outings over his past five starts.\n\nAlso Consider: Yuli Gurriel, C.J. Cron\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nKolten Wong - St. Louis (vs. Cincinnati)\n\nThe Cardinals are playing some pretty good baseball, and Kolten Wong has given them a boost with eight hits, three doubles, one triple, and a homer (5 RBIs, 2 SB) over his past four games. A strong matchup against Cincinnati RHP Tyler Mahle (.397 wOBA vs. LHB) should be enough to keep him going.\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Altuve, Brian Dozier\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nAbraham Toro - Houston (at Toronto)\n\nHouston carries the highest run-scoring projection of this main afternoon slate, as they\u2019ll face Toronto opener Wilmer Font followed by either Sam Gaviglio or Zack Godley. Regardless of who is taking the bump, I\u2019ll be looking towards the Astros to score some runs. Rookie Abraham Toro could make some noise within that, scoring five runs with a homer over his last four starts.\n\nAlso consider: Matt Chapman, Miguel Sano\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nAlex Bregman - Houston (at Toronto)\n\nKeeping the theme with Houston, I\u2019ll be spending on Bregman at shortstop. This position is somewhat lacking in terms of quality options for an affordable price, so climbing the salary ladder for Bregman makes sense from an opportunity cost point of view. As mentioned in the previous write-up, the Astros are expected to clobber the Toronto bullpen, and Bregman is one of the leading candidates to inflict that damage.\n\nAlso Consider: Jorge Polanco, Jonathan Villar\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nMax Kepler - Minnesota (at Detroit)\n\nMinnesota set the major league record for the most homers in a season last night, and I\u2019m not expecting them to slow down. Kepler smacked a round-tripper yesterday, giving him seven hits with two homers and three doubles over his past four games. The matchup looks ripe for the picking against Detroit RHP Spencer Turnbull\u2019s .350 wOBA split to left-handed bats.\n\nJosh Reddick - Houston (at Toronto)\n\nReddick checks in as a solid bargain choice on most daily fantasy sites, as his salary is still on clearance after struggling for nearly a month. However, the Houston outfielder has broken the cold spell by racking up eight hits and seven RBIs over his past five games. He\u2019ll look to feast on the aforementioned generosity of Toronto\u2019s bullpen this afternoon.\n\nAlso consider: George Springer, Yordan Alvarez, Michael Brantley, Eddie Rosario, Anthony Santander, Dexter Fowler, Mark Canha, Jake Cave", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for the main afternoon slate (1:05 ET) on Sunday, September 1.
