It first appeared on scmp.com on Sept. 6, 2019.\n\nNearly a thousand alumni and students across Hong Kong added their voices to a citywide protest on Friday, as demonstrators called on the government to meet all their demands and do more than just withdrawing the extradition bill.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThey formed human chains outside schools in Kowloon Tong, Tai Po and on Hong Kong Island, and asked other students to join them to put pressure on Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor\u2019s administration.\n\nProtesters want an independent investigation into the use of force by police, an amnesty for arrested protesters, a halt to categorizing the protests as riots, and the implementation of universal suffrage.\n\nTheir show of defiance continued despite Lam\u2019s announcement on Wednesday that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill that has sparked months of protests in the city.\n\nWith Lam only acceding to one of the demonstrators' five demands, protesters and politicians from both sides of the divide have said the move was too little, too late.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

I hope she will respond to more of our demands,\u201d said one La Salle College graduate, who wished to remain nameless.\n\nMore than 70 students skipped classes on Monday and Tuesday, according to Chan, a member of the school\u2019s student concern group, who would only give his last name.\n\nDespite that the Education Bureau did not want to see a school boycott, education minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said he would leave it to schools to handle the matter themselves according to their own judgment. Many schools allow students to skip classes if they have the permission letters from parents.\n\nChan, a Form Six student at La Salle, said the turnout was bigger than expected. The school had the largest crowd of the four schools, with more than 300 people involved.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of teachers stood at the gate of each of the schools, watching in silence.\n\n\u201cThe students are very restrained and peaceful, so I\u2019m not too worried that anything radical might happen,\u201d said Andrew Lau, deputy principal of Bishop Hall Jubilee School.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about is that the government has lost the hearts of a generation of young people, and that they might walk further away from the government.\u201d\n\nTeachers at the school were opposed to the strike, and the pupils had been largely obedient, Lau said, who added that there was no class boycott at the school.\n\nIn Tai Po, more than 300 people, including students and alumni from seven secondary schools, and residents and pupils from neighboring schools, formed a human chain stretching across Tat Wan Road.\n\nAccording to the students, 100 students from Kau Yan College went on strike on Monday, and 20 from Law Ting Pong Secondary School went on strike on Thursday.\n\n\u201cTaking part is the only thing I can do as a secondary school student to call for the government to meet the five demands,\u201d said a 17-year-old Form Six student at Law Ting Pong Secondary School, who gave his name as Anson.\n\nProtesters chanted popular slogans such as \u201cliberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d and \u201creturn the eye\u201d, referring to a young woman who suffered a severe eye injury during a violent protest in August.\n\nThe crowd gathered at Tai Po Market MTR station around 6:45 a.m. and left just before 8 a.m. so pupils could go to class on time.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go on the front lines, but we can still yell slogans and show others that many secondary school pupils are aware of the protests and are also fighting for the five demands,\u201d said a 16-year-old Form Six student from neighboring Kau Yan College surnamed Ng.\n\n\u201cThere have been months of protests and so many injured. If Lam withdrew the bill earlier then the problem would have been solved.\n\n\u201cBut we have already gone through so much, such as the Yuen Long incident and police brutality. We cannot stop unless all our demands are met.\u201d\n\nWhile some passers-by cheered the protesters on, others were angry about the disruption.\n\n\u201cThis is a public space. I have my own freedom to enjoy a peaceful and quiet walk down the street,\u201d said a 53 year-old retired Tai Po resident surnamed Leung.\n\n\u201cThe students are still living under their parents\u2019 roof, they should fulfill their responsibility and go to school,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 100 members of St Paul\u2019s Convent School alumni and some school students gathered outside the entrance in Causeway Bay in a show of defiance after teachers prevented a boycott on September 2, and stopped students from wearing ribbons or handing out fliers in support of the boycott.\n\nAt about 7.30am, alumni formed two long lines outside the school\u2019s gates and handed out ribbons to passers-by and held up fliers in support of current students.\n\nAccording to students, the teachers also stopped a planned panel discussion about the extradition bill, and did not allow students to form a human chain.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s really ridiculous that they banned the girls from wearing masks and ribbons,\u201d said Sharon Lam, 21, one of the coordinators of the demonstration, and an ex-student of the school.\n\n\u201cThe school gave \u2018political reasons\u2019 for the move.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lam, Sister Margaret Wong, the school principal, told the students they were \u201cblind rebellious spirits\u201d for planning a class boycott.\n\n\u201cWhile I understand that teachers want to preserve the school\u2019s reputation, I was disappointed when they asked us to cancel our planned activities,\u201d said a 17-year-old student, who wished to remain anonymous.\n\n\u201cI hope the school can hear our voices and will let us say something regarding what is happening in society.\u201d\n\nDuring the demonstrations, the school issued a \u201cspecial notice\u201d on their website reiterating that they did not support a school strike, as the school was \u201ca place to study.\"\n\nHowever, the statement said if a student did want to strike, they must \u201csubmit a parent letter in accordance with the school\u2019s rules.\"\n\nMeanwhile, pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu has formed a concern group to monitor the schools suspected of supporting the boycott.\n\nHe called on the Education Bureau to disqualify those principals and teachers who supported the boycott, and said their approval exceeded the educational and moral ethics for educators.", "description": "The Hong Kong school boycott continued as hundreds turned out in support and called on Carrie Lam to meet all demands made by anti-government protesters.", "authors": ["Cannix Yau", "South China Morning Post", "Yujing Liu", "Gigi Choy", "Rhea Mogul"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b7/a6/ec2273a847b385f64c09be96309a/190906-hong-kong.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
