Photos from the scene showed bodies lying in the streets and pools of blood.\n\nAmid the chaos, an unknown number of inmates also escaped from the Aguaruto prison in Culiacan amid the chaos.\n\nThe state government said in a statement that it was \"working to restore calm and order in the face of the high-impact incidents that have occurred in recent hours in various points around Culiacan.\"\n\nIt called on residents to \"remain calm, stay off the streets and be very attentive to official advisories on the evolving situation.\"\n\nCartel gunmen patrol a street in Culiacan on Thursday as they tried to stop a government operation to arrest one of the sons of jailed drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman [Jesus Bustamante/Reuters]\n\nThe battle broke out in the afternoon near the state prosecutor's office, when masked gunmen blocked traffic and opened fire, causing panicked drivers to abandon their cars in the middle of the street.\n\nThe fighting then spread to several other parts of the city.\n\nGunmen blocked roads and highways around the city into the evening, bringing the capital to a standstill.\n\nThe violence is the third serious incident in Mexico this week, after 13 police officers were ambushed and killed by drug cartel members in another western state on Monday, and a number of civilians were killed in a shootout the following day.\n\nThe number of violent homicides in Mexico this year is on track to a record high, Al Jazeera's Rapalo said, heaping pressure on the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.\n\nDrug-fuelled violence\n\nEl Chapo, 62, was sentenced to life in prison in July for trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States over the course of a quarter-century.\n\nHowever, his Sinaloa cartel remains one of the most powerful in Mexico.\n\nGuzman's extradition unleashed an initial period of instability in the group, as his sons waged war with cartel co-founder, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, for control, leaving a trail of bodies in their wake.\n\nBut the situation appears to have evolved into a reluctant truce.\n\nEl Chapo, whose nickname means \"Shorty,\" was rearrested in 2016 after a brazen prison escape - the second of his career.\n\nHe is considered the most powerful drug lord since Colombia's Pablo Escobar, who was killed in a police shootout in 1993.\n\nAfter being convicted in a New York court, he is now serving his sentence in the ADX federal maximum security prison in Colorado.\n\nOvidio and his brother Alfredo have tried to fill their father's shoes, but anti-narcotics experts portray them as flashy party boys who have little ability to run the business side of the cartel.\n\nKnown as \"Los Chapitos,\" or The Little Chapos, the pair were attacked in 2016 in a restaurant in the beach town of Puerto Vallarta.\n\nThey survived the attack, which the authorities called an attempted hit by rivals.", "description": "Gunfire in western city of Culiacan left blazing vehicles strewn across streets and sent residents running for safety.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/59bc5dcb317441c8800a82600bc2b57a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
