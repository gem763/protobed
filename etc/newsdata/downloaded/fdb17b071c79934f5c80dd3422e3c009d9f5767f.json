We want to conduct an investigation into the FCO\u2019s decision to advise Northamptonshire police that this lady had the benefit of diplomatic immunity.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not satisfied, then we\u2019ll go to a judicial review and ask a high court judge to review it all.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in New York on Monday, Tim Dunn said: \u201cSomewhere, somebody has made a decision to give this lady immunity. She\u2019s not entitled to immunity as it\u2019s been said and we\u2019ve known that from the start.\n\n\u201cThey made a mistake, someone has made a mistake.\u201d", "description": "Lawyers call for Foreign Office to explain its advice to Northamptonshire police that Anne Sacoolas was shielded from prosecution", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c8f9d0e8bf8bbc41eaf1d8830f7d207ae6dd461/0_1156_2666_1600/master/2666.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=824dff519dc2e3b358465132ae52e8c2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
