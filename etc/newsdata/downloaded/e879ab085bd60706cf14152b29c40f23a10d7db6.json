REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo\n\nOpposition factional feuding has been a significant factor in the seven consecutive landslide election wins since 2010 achieved by right-wing Prime Minister and Fidesz leader Viktor Orban at national, municipal and European parliament level.\n\nThe extent of the damage done by the audio to the campaign of mayoral hopeful Gergely Karacsony was not immediately clear, although another leak in 2006 of a speech by the then socialist prime minister in which he admitted lying about the economy to get elected eventually forced him out of power.\n\nThe incumbent in the Budapest mayoral race, Fidesz-backed Istvan Tarlos, appears to be the front-runner based on the latest surveys.\n\nBut an upset by Karacsony, the mayor of one of the capital\u2019s districts, would represent the first major election triumph for Hungary\u2019s fragmented opposition since Fidesz swept to power at the start of the decade.\n\nIn a 3-1/2-minute recording posted on website 444.hu, which has been edited several times over the course of the conversation, Karacsony is heard discussing power struggles and corruption plots in the socialist camp and the limits to his bargaining power in Budapest.\n\nHis voice is also heard saying that there is no return for him to his Budapest district as he \u201cwould be buried\u201d.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Karacsony said the audio of a private conversation was made with what he called secret service methods in what he described as an attempt by Fidesz to intimidate him. Karacsony also says the recording was manipulated.\n\n\u201cWe are batting back every attack with a joint effort. Every attack strengthens this alliance and me personally,\u201d wrote Karacsony, who is backed by five leftist parties, including the Socialists and former PM Ferenc Gyurcsany\u2019s Democratic Coalition.\n\nA poll by think tank Zavecz Research published by local news website 24.hu earlier this month put support for Karacsony at 33% of Budapest voters, while the incumbent Fidesz-backed Tarlos had 38% support ahead of the October 13 election.\n\nThe Nezopont think tank put support for 71-year-old Tarlos, Budapest Mayor since 2010, at 43% versus 29% for 44-year-old Karacsony, the mayor of a Budapest district and co-chairman of the Parbeszed Magyarorszagert (Dialogue for Hungary) party.\n\nAsked at a Thursday news conference whether the recording served Fidesz\u2019s interests ahead of the election, Orban\u2019s chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, said the leak was probably the result of leftist infighting.\n\n\u201cThere are mafia-like conditions on the left,\u201d Gulyas said. \u201cGergely Karacsony is a part of these.\u201d", "description": "A leftist's bid to wrest the political leadership in Hungary's capital from the ruling Fidesz party suffered a blow on Thursday with the leak of a taped conversation in which the opposition candidate for Budapest mayor discusses infighting within the left.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434162896&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P188", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
