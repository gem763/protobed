Let\u2019s review:\n\nAD\n\nTrump can shut down any lawful investigation of himself, for any reason. Trump\u2019s lawyers flatly declared in a memo to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III that as the \u201cnation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer,\u201d the president cannot commit obstruction of justice by definition, because that \u201cwould amount to obstructing himself.\" Even on a passing whim, he can legitimately \u201cterminate the inquiry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump himself has stated this. \u201cI had the right to end the whole Witch Hunt if I wanted,\u201d he tweeted. Law enforcement, c\u2019est moi.\n\nOf course, Trump did try to fire Mueller, unsuccessfully ordering his White House counsel to do so and then directing him to cover that up, and tried to limit the investigation in numerous other ways. Trump\u2019s position is that all this is perfectly legitimate, because he is president.\n\nAD\n\nTrump cannot be criminally investigated. Trump did end up tolerating the Mueller probe, but only after failing in his repeated attempts to shut it down and drastically curtail it, which, again, he viewed as correct courses of action.\n\nSince then, Trump\u2019s lawyers have taken the position in court that a state-level effort to get Trump\u2019s tax returns is illegitimate, because presidents cannot be targets of criminal investigations, due to the burden it imposes on them, a stance legal experts dismiss as absurd.\n\nAD\n\nTrump, of course, has refused to release the returns, defying a half century of precedent, precisely because it might enable a process of accountability for his extensive corruption on other fronts, such as accepting payments from foreign officials and governments.\n\nAD\n\nTrump cannot be prosecuted (or even be guilty of anything). The special counsel, of course, declined to prosecute Trump for multiple acts of obstruction, including ones Mueller determined were undertaken with corrupt intent, due to regulations against indicting sitting presidents.\n\nMueller did not exonerate, either, but crucially, Trump has repeatedly hailed this as total exoneration. Beneath this dissembling bluster is an actual claim of sorts: Because as president Trump could not be prosecuted for acts that he otherwise would have been prosecuted for in just about any other circumstances, he cannot have been guilty of them.\n\nAD\n\nTrump cannot be legitimately impeached. The special counsel suggested that Congress \u2014 i.e., impeachment \u2014 was the only mechanism of accountability left. House Democrats have launched a full impeachment inquiry, due to Trump\u2019s corrupt pressure on a foreign leader to interfere in the next U.S. election on his behalf.\n\nAD\n\nTrump is now dismissing this as a \u201cCOUP,\u201d while calling for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to be jailed for treason for leading that inquiry. The only upshot of this can be that the people\u2019s very last resort against a corrupt and dangerous president \u2014 who happens to be Trump himself \u2014 is itself illegitimate.\n\nThe framers gave the power of impeachment to the House because its members are the people\u2019s most direct representatives. As one ratifier of the Constitution put it, \u201cthis power is lodged in those who represent the great body of the people, because the occasion for its exercise will arise from acts of great injury to the community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn short, House members have the power to impeach precisely because they can exercise it most legitimately. Trump is turning this principle on its head.\n\nAD\n\nNothing Trump does constitutes misconduct. Trump will not allow for the existence of any rules-bound or law-bound limits on his conduct. Trump has blithely conceded he brought up Joe Biden on his call with the Ukrainian president, while also saying there was nothing wrong with this, because he was merely trying to make U.S. military aid contingent on rooting out \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Trump is explicitly saying he can legitimately pressure a foreign leader \u2014 who is desperately awaiting that aid \u2014 to work against his political opponent, simply by falsifying that opponent\u2019s conduct and then calling it \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nTrump has unlimited power to declare any profoundly corrupt act on his part legitimate. In this hermetically sealed rhetorical universe, any agreement on reasonable and legitimate limits on Trump\u2019s misconduct is simply impossible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhich brings us to the final point ...\n\nTrump can legitimately and brazenly cheat to prevent his removal in an election. The subject matter of the impeachment inquiry itself casts the entire election into doubt. As Will Wilkinson puts it: \u201cTrump\u2019s brazen attempt to cheat his way into a second term stands so scandalously exposed that there can be no assurance of a fair election if he\u2019s allowed to stay in office.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d go even further: Trump is declaring for himself the power to engage in bottomless corruption to prevent a legitimate election from removing him, while also declaring that any effort to impeach him for those corrupt acts is inherently illegitimate.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s more, we already know Trump will likely declare any election that he loses illegitimate. In the run-up to 2016, Trump repeatedly declared that the outcome would not be legitimate unless he won. Trump is again reviving his false claims of rampant voter fraud \u2014 a preview of how he\u2019ll delegitimize an electoral loss.\n\nAD\n\nTo sum up: Trump can close down investigations into himself for any reason whatsoever. Trump can\u2019t be legitimately investigated or legitimately prosecuted. Trump can do no wrong in trying to rig the election in his favor, and he can\u2019t legitimately lose it. And Trump can\u2019t be legitimately impeached.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nGreg Sargent: How Democrats can build support for impeachment, with Trump\u2019s help\n\nGreg Sargent: The whistleblower alleged a Trump coverup.
