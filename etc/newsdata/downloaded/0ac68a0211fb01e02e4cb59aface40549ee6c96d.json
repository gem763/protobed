Any referendum requires legislation. This one also required negotiation and agreement. Alas, no majority exists for any option for a deal with the EU.\n\nBrexiters are as much to blame for this as Remainers.\n\nConsequently, \u201cno deal\u201d has emerged as the fallback position. But the Leave campaign said essentially nothing about a no-deal exit. There is no mandate for what every informed observer, including the civil service, knows would be a disruptive and costly result. It would also be just the beginning of negotiations, not their end.\n\nThere is no mandate for what every informed observer, including the civil service, knows would be a disruptive and costly result. Financial Times\n\nBut those talks would occur in worse circumstances. There would be pervasive economic uncertainty. This would be a mad choice. Governments exist to help their countries, not harm them deliberately.\n\nAmong the most important reasons for this outcome is the refusal, especially on the Brexit side, to try to understand the EU. They needed to comprehend that the EU is an existential project for its members, not just a trade deal. Application of European law, under the European Court of Justice, is a central part of that project.\n\nThe EU, with 27 remaining members, was also sure to be an inflexible counterparty.\n\nWhat next? The government\u2019s Heath Robinson-esque plan, in which Northern Ireland is to be inside the EU\u2019s regulatory system for goods but not its customs area, will be rejected as leaky, legally unenforceable and incompatible with border-free trade in Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also represents a rejection of the UK\u2019s 2017 commitments on the Irish border. This is sure to have further weakened trust in Britain\u2019s reliability. Remember, too, that the EU has long land borders. It will not allow the precedent of intentionally porous borders.\n\nSome believe this plan ought to fly with the EU. It will not. If Northern Ireland were inside the EU\u2019s customs area, too, it could work. But, if the rest of the UK is to have its own trade and regulatory policies, this would make the Irish Sea the UK\u2019s customs and regulatory border with the EU. That would be unacceptable to the Democratic Unionist party and the Conservatives. It might reignite violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nIf the rest of the UK is to have its own trade and regulatory policies, this would make the Irish Sea the UK\u2019s customs and regulatory border with the EU. Financial Times\n\nSo what happens if no deal can be agreed before October 31?\n\nOne question is whether the EU agrees to another extension when the British government clearly does not want one. Assume that it does, but only with conditions. What might those be?\n\nOne possibility would be to try to ratify Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. That would allow the UK and the EU to move on to negotiating a new relationship. This would also mean a compromise between Brexiters and Remainers, itself highly desirable. But it seems impossible. For Remainers, it is too little; for Brexiters, it is too much. Remainers want to stay in the EU. Brexiters reject the Irish backstop that would keep the UK in the EU\u2019s customs area and restrict its trade policy indefinitely.\n\nA second possibility is another referendum, probably on a choice between no deal and Remain. Such a vote should be legitimate since no deal played so little part in the referendum.\n\nBut it would require creation of a caretaker government. That would be hard enough to do. It might also be impossible to agree a question and then carry out a referendum, without large-scale violence. To me, another referendum is the least bad option. But it creates great risks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, there could be an early general election. A drawback is that this would involve many issues apart from Brexit and might lead to another hung parliament. With Mr Johnson campaigning against parliament, it could have dire consequences in both the short and long runs. But it might resolve the Brexit issue, temporarily.\n\nYet the issue now is not just Brexit. It is far deeper. The Conservative party has become an English nationalist party, busily stoking populist resentment. Meanwhile, the hard left has seized the Labour party. The curse of extremist politics has only just begun.\n\nOnce people see opponents as \u201ctraitors\u201d to an imaginary \u201cpeople\u201d, demons of hatred are unleashed. Brexit awoke those demons. Mr Johnson, aided by Nigel Farage and his Brexit party, will seek to win by freeing them. They are sure to wreak havoc for a very long time. martin.wolf@ft.com\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Once people see opponents as 'traitors' to an imaginary 'people', demons of hatred are unleashed.
