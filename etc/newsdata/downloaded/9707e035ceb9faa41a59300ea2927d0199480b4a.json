There were plenty of \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants too \u2014 and rightfully so. Davis\u2019s historic night marked the official launch of his 2020 MVP campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s even scratched the surface yet,\u201d LeBron James warned. \u201cWe\u2019re all still getting comfortable on the floor. He was wonderful tonight, spectacular in all facets. We needed it.\u201d\n\nAfter forcing his way out of New Orleans this summer, Davis now plays on the NBA\u2019s grandest stage. He dunks and drop steps beneath the retired jerseys of legend after legend, and statistical accumulations reverberate in ways they didn\u2019t when he was a small-market Pelican.\n\nThis was the fourth time Davis has scored 40 points and grabbed 20 rebounds in a game \u2014 the most among active players \u2014 but it was the first time his achievement drew immediate comparisons to Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Those three Hall of Famers are the only other Lakers to reach the 40/20 club in the past 50 seasons, and all three are former MVPs and champions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d Davis said, after setting a franchise record by making 26 free throws. \u201cGreat company. To be here and to be a part of this franchise and to do something special like that, on a list with those legends, it means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nThe mild-mannered Davis is a far better player than he is a hype man, but the massive media apparatus that tracks the Lakers\u2019 every move will have no trouble filling in the gaps. In what has become a nightly occurrence, more than two dozen reporters jockeyed for space postgame in front of Davis\u2019s locker, displacing or inconveniencing multiple Lakers players. So far, he hasn\u2019t played to the crowd, deflecting questions with bland statements of fact.\n\nThe 2020 MVP race is off to a captivating start, with or without bluster from Davis. Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, Los Angeles Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard and Minnesota Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns have all put together strong opening weeks. James deserves mention too, although Davis has been the superior two-way performer during the Lakers\u2019 3-1 start.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo claim his first MVP, the 26-year-old Davis will need to separate himself from James, navigate a wide-open field and, of course, remain healthy. His best MVP finish \u2014 third place in 2018 \u2014 came when he appeared in a career-high 75 games and valiantly led the Pelicans on a late-season playoff push.\n\nInjuries remain a touchy subject for Davis, who flatly denied any problems with his shoulder following the Lakers\u2019 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday. In fact, he had aggravated it while missing a dunk and was still feeling the effects two days later. Davis dealt with multiple shoulder injuries during his time in New Orleans, and he headed to the locker room during Tuesday\u2019s game for treatment. Upon his return, he appeared to favor it at times and blanched when Lakers center Dwight Howard attempted to pull him up the court with both hands.\n\n\u201cIt was bothering me a lot,\u201d Davis admitted later. \u201cIt was very sore. I came to the back and adjusted some things. It felt good so I went back out. It\u2019s still a little sore.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe malady hardly curbed his impact, as he brilliantly finished a spinning lob on a half-court pass from James and tutored Jaren Jackson Jr., the promising Grizzlies forward, all night. During a third-quarter takeover, Davis paraded to the free throw line for 18 attempts and managed to score 20 points while taking just one shot from the field.\n\nAfter watching his various big men cycle in and out of the game with foul trouble, Grizzlies Coach Taylor Jenkins acknowledged that Davis \u201ctook advantage of everyone on the floor.\u201d He spoke with the blank tone of a man who knew his roster simply wasn\u2019t equipped with an adequate answer.\n\nTo his new superstar partner, Davis\u2019s barrage was validation for the Lakers\u2019 bold decision to part with multiple prospects and draft picks in a June blockbuster.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c[Tonight] just solidified why we went out and got him,\u201d James said. \u201cTonight was one of those games. He was big time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe James/Davis partnership runs both ways, though, and the latter has plenty to gain too. Fame, recognition and postseason success all proved elusive in New Orleans, and he landed in Los Angeles seeking progress on all fronts. Davis\u2019s quick chemistry with James, his instant connection with his new fan base and now his first statement game in LA have made it clear that there will be no looking back.\n\nHis future, meanwhile, is already starting to come into focus.\n\nAD", "description": "Davis joined an elite group of Lakers \u2014 Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2014 after scoring 40 points and grabbing 20 rebounds against Memphis.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8gqEQK1r-88WHDaLmPfS4VQNQlw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XGYXVQX23II6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
