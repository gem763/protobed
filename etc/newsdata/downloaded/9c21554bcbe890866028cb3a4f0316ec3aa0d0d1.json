Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who spent a mere $1.6 million. Two interest groups are tied in third place. The Judicial Crisis network has dropped $1.2 million, as has The Need to Impeach.\n\nDemocratic hopefuls in the presidential, congressional and gubernatorial races are currently making 44% of the ad buys, spending a total so far this year of $65 million. That includes $27 million on the White House bout.\n\nRepublicans are in for 35% of the spending, for a total of $51 million.
