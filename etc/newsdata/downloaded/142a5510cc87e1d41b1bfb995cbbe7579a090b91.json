Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump reportedly told U.S. diplomats in New York City. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower has not been publicly identified, though The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported he is a CIA officer previously detailed to the White House.\n\nSchiff condemned Trump\u2019s \u201cthreats\u201d against the whistleblower on Sunday and said his committee would pay close attention to the security risks involved in his testimony.\n\n\u201cAs Director Maguire promised during the hearing, that whistleblower will be allowed to come in and come in without a minder from the Justice Department or from the White House to tell the whistleblower what they can and cannot say,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are taking all the precautions we can to ... allow that testimony to go forward in a way that protects the whistleblower\u2019s identity,\u201d he added. \u201cWith the president issuing threats ... you can imagine the security concerns here.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
