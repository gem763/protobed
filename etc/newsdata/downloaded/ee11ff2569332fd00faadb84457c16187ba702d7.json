In 2017, before the trade war started, Apple was fifth in this ranking. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s biggest local rival, Huawei Technologies Co., climbed two spots and came in second, behind only Chinese payment service Alipay.\n\nThe shuffle in the rankings is a sign of the growing challenge American brands face in the second year of Donald Trump\u2019s tariff showdown with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The survey findings show Chinese consumers growing cooler towards some American brands, especially after smartphone giant Huawei saw its Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, arrested in Canada last year at the behest of the U.S. government.\n\nTrump followed with a ban on Huawei products, which helped fuel a surge of local support for the Shenzhen-based brand, according to Jay Milliken, senior partner in Hong Kong with Prophet, the San Francisco-based consultancy that conducted the survey of 13,500 Chinese consumers.\n\nProphet\u2019s survey, conducted annually, this year asked Chinese consumers in large cities for their views on more than 250 brands across 27 categories. Respondents evaluated brands they used or were considering using, rating rated their relevance to the lives of consumers based on qualities such as innovation, usefulness and dependability.\n\n\u2018Nationalistic Buying\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nationalistic buying in that category, because Chinese consumers interpreted what happened to Huawei as an attack,\u201d he said.\n\nPatriotism helped fuel the rise of other Chinese brands, too. Sportswear maker Li Ning Co. cracked the top 40 for the first time, ranked No. 34, just two spots behind market leader Nike Inc (NYSE: ).\n\nNamed after its founder, the famous gymnast, Li Ning capitalized on the nationalistic sentiments of many Chinese consumers with the launch last year of a China Li-Ning collection at New York Fashion Week that heavily used red and yellow, China\u2019s national colors.\n\nThere were only two American names in the top ten this year -- Android at No. 3 and Intel (NASDAQ: ) at No. 9 -- compared to five in the 2017 survey.\n\nSwitching Allegiances\n\nUnlike Apple, Android and Intel don\u2019t have to worry about consumers switching allegiances to local competitors, Milliken said, and that explains why they manage to remain highly ranked.\n\n\u201cSome Western brands are so integral in the lives of Chinese consumers, they\u2019re almost predisposed to not losing relevance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no Chinese alternatives so those remain super relevant.\u201d\n\nGeopolitical tensions aren\u2019t the only problem Apple faces in China, its biggest market after the U.S.\n\nWhile Beijing is pushing to make the country a leader in the introduction of high-speed 5G networks, Apple\u2019s phones -- even the newly announced iPhone 11 -- don\u2019t support that latest wireless standard.", "description": "Apple\u2019s Brand in China Takes a Hit From Backlash Against Trump", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic71838eae3dcb6f2fde9e4b2e387dc801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
