While the results do not guarantee that Gantz will be the next prime minister, they signaled that Netanyahu, who has led the country for over 10 years, could have trouble holding on to the job.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAddressing his supporters early Wednesday, Netanyahu refused to concede defeat and vowed to work to form a new government that excludes Arab parties. His campaign focused heavily on attacking and questioning the loyalty of the country\u2019s Arab minority \u2014 a strategy that drew accusations of racism and incitement from Arab leaders.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days we will convene negotiations to assemble a strong Zionist government and to prevent a dangerous anti-Zionist government,\u201d he said. He claimed that Arab parties \u201cnegate the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state\u201d and \u201cglorify bloodthirsty murderers.\u201d\n\nIsraeli exit polls are often imprecise, and final results, expected Wednesday, could still swing in Netanyahu\u2019s favor. But all three stations predicted a similar outcome.\n\nAccording to those polls, neither Likud nor Blue and White, with their smaller respective allies, could control a majority in the 120-seat parliament without the support of Avigdor Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beitenu party. That put Lieberman, a former protege of Netanyahu\u2019s who has become one of the prime minister\u2019s fiercest rivals, in the position of kingmaker.\n\nArab parties, which have never before sat in an Israeli government, also finished strong, and exit polls predicted they would form the third largest party in parliament.\n\nAddressing his supporters late Tuesday, a jubilant Lieberman said he saw only \u201cone option:\u201d a broad, secular coalition with both Blue and White and Likud.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that a unity government is only possible in emergency situations. And I tell you and I tell every citizen today watching us on television: the situation, both security-wise and economically, are emergency situations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country, therefore, requires a broad government.\u201d\n\nEarly Wednesday, Gantz told a cheering rally of supporters that while it was too soon to declare victory, he had begun speaking to potential partners and hoped to form a unity government.\n\n\u201cStarting tonight we will work to form a broad unity government that will express the will of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nAttention will now focus on Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, who is to choose the candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a stable coalition. Rivlin is to consult with all parties in the coming days before making his decision.\n\nAfter that, the prime minister designate would have up to six weeks to form a coalition. If that fails, Rivlin could give another candidate for prime minister 28 days to form a coalition. And if that doesn\u2019t work, new elections would be triggered yet again. Rivlin has said he will do everything possible to avoid such a scenario.\n\nLieberman called for an immediate start to negotiations and predicted it could be wrapped up quickly. But such a deal promises to be complicated.\n\nGantz, a former military chief who has presented himself as a unifying figure in a divided nation, has ruled out a partnership with Likud if Netanyahu remains at the helm at a time when he is expected to be indicted on criminal charges.\n\nBut in his speech, he made no such conditions. \u201cI intend to speak with everyone,\u201d he said, without mentioning Netanyahu.\n\nLieberman, who leads a nationalist but secular party, is unlikely to sit with Arab parties on the left or ultra-Orthodox religious parties on the right.\n\nThat could limit both Gantz\u2019s and Netanyahu\u2019s ability to maneuver and could potentially put pressure on the longtime leader, who has ruled for over a decade, to step aside.\n\nLikud members said they remained behind their leader.\n\n\u201cWe have the basic principal of standing by the party leader who was elected in the party primary, which is why we won\u2019t take action against Netanyahu,\u201d said lawmaker Micky Zohar, a Netanyahu loyalist.\n\nNetanyahu had sought an outright majority with his allies in hopes of passing legislation to give him immunity from the expected indictment.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three scandals, pending a hearing scheduled next month. A formal indictment would increase the pressure on Netanyahu to step aside if he does not have immunity.\n\nNetanyahu tried to portray himself as a seasoned statesman uniquely qualified to lead the country through challenging times during an alarmist campaign marked by mudslinging and slogans that were condemned as racist. Gantz tried to paint Netanyahu as divisive and scandal-plagued, offering himself as a calming influence and honest alternative.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s campaign promoted images of him jetting off to world capitals and boasting of warm relations with powerful leaders, most notably President Donald Trump.\n\nAt the same time, he issued repeated doomsday warnings that his opponents were scheming with politicians from the country\u2019s Arab minority to \u201csteal\u201d the election.\n\nHe tried, and failed, to pass legislation that would allow cameras in polling stations, a step he said was needed to crack down on alleged fraud in Arab towns. Facebook suspended his account for 24 hours last week after it published a post saying that \u201cArabs want to annihilate all of us.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu also sought to appeal to his hardline base with a number of election promises, including plans to annex all of Israel\u2019s settlements in the West Bank.\n\nHis proposal, which could extinguish any remaining hopes for a Palestinian state, were condemned by much of the world, including important Arab countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia. But the U.S. remained muted, suggesting he had coordinated with Washington ahead of time.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s frenetic warnings about Arabs appeared to backfire, turning off some Jewish voters and driving heavy turnout in the Arab sector.\n\nAyman Odeh, leader of the main Arab faction in parliament, said Netanyahu\u2019s repeated attacks had boosted turnout and hurt Netanyahu in the end.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a heavy price to pay for incitement,\u201d he told Channel 13 TV.\n\nThe election was Israel\u2019s second of the year.\n\nIn April\u2019s vote, Netanyahu appeared to have the upper hand, with his traditional allies of nationalist and ultra-religious Jewish parties controlling a parliamentary majority.\n\nBut Lieberman, his mercurial ally-turned-rival, refused to join the new coalition, citing excessive influence it granted the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties. Without a parliamentary majority, Netanyahu dissolved parliament and called a new election.\n\nLieberman\u2019s gamble paid off Tuesday, and exit polls suggested his party had nearly doubled in strength, to as many as 10 seats.\n\nIsrael\u2019s election commission said 69.4% of all eligible voters cast ballots by the time polls closed on Tuesday evening, a slightly larger number than took part in April\u2019s vote. Turnout in April\u2019s elections was 68.5%.", "description": "But the longtime prime minister said he will still work to form a new government.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5f/52/89e8c1674767b7e19dd1358bd49a/190917-bibi-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
