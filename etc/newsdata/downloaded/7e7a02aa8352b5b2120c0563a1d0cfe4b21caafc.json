The holy grail is, of course, the ability to integrate them directly into the display, as we\u2019ve already seen with fingerprint sensors \u2014 and selfie cameras are next.\n\nOppo, a company that\u2019s done its share of anti-bezel experimentation with display notches and pop-up selfie cameras, is the first to demonstrate an under-screen camera to the public at MWC Shanghai this week, after a tease earlier in the month. Alongside the showing, Oppo has revealed more information about how the technology actually works.\n\nOPPO's brand new solution for full-screen display - Under-screen Camera (USC) has just been unveiled here at #MWC19 Shanghai! #MoreThanTheSeen pic.twitter.com/k5qEQ3QNta \u2014 OPPO India (@oppomobileindia) June 26, 2019\n\nOppo says the display uses a custom transparent material that works with a redesigned pixel structure so that light can get through to the camera. The sensor itself is said to be larger than other selfie cameras, with a wider aperture lens in front. The area of the screen reserved for the camera still works with touch control, and Oppo says display quality won\u2019t be compromised \u2014 though hands-on photos from Engadget Chinese suggest the camera area is visible in certain conditions.\n\nOppo does acknowledge that putting a screen in front of a camera will inherently reduce photo image quality, with significant problems like haze, glare, and color cast needing to be overcome. The company says it\u2019s developed algorithms that are tuned to the hardware in order to address these issues, and claims the quality is \u201con par with mainstream devices,\u201d but we\u2019ll have to see for ourselves what that means once the tech ships on a commercial phone.\n\nWhen will that be? Oppo says it plans to launch a device with an under-screen camera \u201cin the near future.\u201d The company often shows off core technology at trade shows in prototype form before shipping it on a commercial product \u2014 the current Reno flagship phone with its periscope zoom lens is a good example \u2014 so there\u2019s reason to believe such a phone will be coming soon.", "description": "Oppo is the first to demonstrate an under-screen selfie camera to the public at MWC Shanghai this week.
