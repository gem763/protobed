So what was the trigger behind this spurt? Yes Bank\u2019s stock jumped on the reports that the bank is looking to sell a minority stake to a global technology company to strengthen its balance sheet. However, the bank has not confirmed this report, and in the scenario, this news is proved wrong, the stock\u2019s fall could be even more severe. Yes Bank\u2019s investors need this good news to go through after the bank has been hampered with a spate of bad press surrounding it in the last year or so.\n\nYes Bank\u2019s troubles began last year when RBI alleged Yes Bank of corporate governance issues and poor compliance culture prevailing at that time. RBI also recommended to the Yes Bank\u2019s board to not hike bonus and remuneration of MD and CEO Rana Kapoor. It even advocated clawing back the bonus paid to him for the financial year 2015 and 2016. Then in September last year, RBI asked the bank to end Kapoor\u2019s tenure by January 2019 and disapproved bank\u2019s plea to extend Kapoor\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe RBI removed Rana Kapoor for not showing enough transparency with regards to stressed loans. Kapoor\u2019s replacement Ravneet Gill promised to resurrect the declining fortunes of the bank, but he too was faced with a mounting challenge to clean up the books of Yes Bank. A few months back, RBI censured Yes Bank of regulatory action as it pointed that the bank is deliberately trying to mislead the public by mentioning only the positive developments while other lapses and breaches are not disclosed.\n\nThen last month, Gautam Thapar promoted CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd (NS: ) disclosed certain suspect transactions to the stock exchange after the audit committee of the company found out those discrepancies. Yes Bank incidentally owned a 13% stake in CG Power, which is why its stock also suffered last month.\n\nAll in all the stock has suffered from a steep decline from Rs. 320 levels to Rs. 71 in the span of one year, thereby losing 80% of its value in the process.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Nifty 50, CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd.
