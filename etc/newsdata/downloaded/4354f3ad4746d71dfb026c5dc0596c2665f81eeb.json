Humankind, USA TODAY\n\nATLANTA -- Having an incarcerated parent is traumatic for children. They are often a forgotten demographic, a forgotten victim. That's why Andrea Shelton is equipping those parents to be the best parents they can be while inside prison walls.\n\n\"People can be angry at people in prison, and so often the needs of the caregivers and the children are forgotten,\" explains Shelton, the president of HeartBound Ministries. \"I think it's so important that we bridge the gap between parent and child when they're separated by prison. This is not a place where you can just go any time and visit your parent.\"\n\nIn Georgia, there's an estimated 75,000 children with incarcerated parents. The state is high in incarceration rates and low in literacy. Shelton saw this as an opportunity for change.\n\nIn 2014, Shelton created HeartBound Ministries' Little Readers program, a personalized, recorded reading program allowing children of incarcerated parents to see and hear their mothers and fathers reading a book to them on DVD. Parents can choose from a variety of books to read; they can also pick out a different shirt to wear for the recording, so their child doesn't have to see them in their prison uniform.\n\nThe DVDs allow kids to see that their parent is okay and still loves them.\n\nAnne Van Pelt sits down to begin her recorded reading session for her 10-year-old daughter.

Her nonprofit won a grant of $50,000 through a USA TODAY NETWORK initiative called \"A Community Thrives.\"\n\nFilled with the excitement of all the possibilities, Shelton started with an idea she conceived in 2003: literacy carts.\n\n\"Having sat through visitations at least 16 months when my own brother was incarcerated, I just saw these kids and these signs that loomed in every visitation room, 'You're responsible for your children,' and they had to behave, right? I thought, 'Gosh, that's hard. To sit there that long when you're little with nothing to do,'\" recalls Shelton.\n\nShelton would sit in those rooms, just thinking of the possibilities.\n\nWith new resources and funding at her disposal, her dream became a reality. In the fall of 2018, Little Readers rolled out 68 literacy carts, filled with books, puzzles, flashcards, games and more. Parents can choose from 50 different titles to read with their little ones.\n\nIn addition to advancing literacy in visitation rooms, Shelton also used the grant money to expand the Little Readers program to new facilities and equip facilities with their own recording software, raising the amount of kids impacted from about 1,000 a year to more than 1,600 in 2018. Kids also have the opportunity to receive more DVDs and books throughout the year as more and more facilities gain their own equipment and can record more frequently.\n\n\"We could be changing outcomes here. We could be changing the direction of a child's future because they sat on their parent's lap when they were little in a visitation room, and they read,\" says Shelton.\n\nShelton hopes to continue expanding and to develop interactive workbooks for parents and their kids. She also has a message for other states:\n\n\"There should be a literacy cart in every prison in the country. Maybe Georgia will start the trend.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/humankind/2019/01/22/incarcerated-parents-bond-their-kids-through-books-and-activities/2649863002/", "description": "Literacy carts in prison visitation rooms allow kids to bond with their incarcerated parents.", "authors": ["Danielle Barker", "Published P.M.
