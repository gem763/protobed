Carey Hart shared a 40th birthday message to Pink on Sunday afternoon, and it\u2019s clear he thinks his wife is more amazing than ever. To make matters even more romantic, the off-road truck racer playfully gushed he couldn\u2019t wait to see \u201chow nuts\u201d the couple will be in their twilight years. And TBH, same.\n\nHart shared his sweet tribute to the singer via Instagram, revealing a slideshow of photos featuring the couple throughout their nearly 20 years together \u2014 from their early dating days to their journey as parents together. \u201cWelcome to 40 baby. I\u2019ve celebrated 18 birthdays with you, and I can say it\u2019s amazing growing up with you,\u201d Hart began the caption before launching into a full-blown praise-fest for his wife. \u201cThe person you have grown into is inspiring. You have become a successful business woman, superstar, dedicated mother, Philanthropist, supportive wife, wine maker, motorcycle mama, and amazing friend to all around you. I\u2019m so proud of the woman you have become, and you are more beautiful than ever.\u201d\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nHe then went on to express his excitement over what\u2019s yet to come for the couple. \u201cYou truly are like wine. You just keep getting better, and I\u2019m so lucky to be along on this crazy ride with you,\u201d Hart wrote, joking, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how nuts you and I are in our 80\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe couple has experienced a lot in the two decades of life they\u2019ve shared. During an interview with Carson Daly for the Today show that aired in April, Pink admitted the duo \u2014 who are the parents of Willow Sage, 8, and Jameson Moon, 2 \u2014 had been in therapy for much of their relationship. \u201cCarey and I have been in couples\u2019 counseling almost our entire 17 years that we\u2019ve been together,\u201d she said, elaborating, \u201cWe come from broken families, and we had no model for: How are we supposed to keep this family together and this crazy life? And there\u2019s no book that says, \u2018Here\u2019s how to do this.\u2019 So, we go to counseling, and it works.\u201d\n\nAfter seeing Hart\u2019s birthday tribute slideshow, it seems evident the pair is doing something right. It\u2019s also hard to disagree with Hart; Pink does seem to be getting even more incredible with each passing year. To her credit, maybe it\u2019s because the singer is leaning into aging. \u201cThank you for my birthday wishes,\u201d she captioned her own Instagram post. \u201cI\u2019m jumping for joy to be 40. I\u2019m so f\u2019ing into it.\u201d\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter. For the latest news, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "description": "Some people just get better with age!
