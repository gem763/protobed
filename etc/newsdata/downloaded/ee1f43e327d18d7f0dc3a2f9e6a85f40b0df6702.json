However the president has denied pressuring the Ukrainian leader into launching an investigation by holding back military aid.\n\nThe issue lies at the heart of the impeachment investigation. The Bidens have always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMs Yovanovitch, who has been a diplomat for 33 years, served as US ambassador to Ukraine from August 2016 \u2013 during the final year of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency \u2013 to May 2019.\n\nIn her testimony, she offers vehement denials of a number of allegations levelled at her before and since her departure, loosely based around the idea that she was opposing corruption investigations into the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI want to categorically state that I have never myself or through others, directly or indirectly, ever directed, suggested, or in any other way asked for any government or government official in Ukraine (or elsewhere) to refrain from investigating or prosecuting actual corruption,\u201d Ms Yovanovitch says at one point, according to the opening statement copy published by The Washington Post.", "description": "The ousted US ambassador to Ukraine has claimed that Donald Trump pushed for her removal, denting the US president\u2019s attempts to wave away the scandal that triggered the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Ben Riley-Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r9nYU30qSkAXHMWJrBISSA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/dba3de24291998c9881f3f0819c52c35", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
