In the past, free to download games, with their forced ads, cunningly insinuated in-app purchases, and subtle, psychologically-crafted hooks, seemed to be most people\u2019s only option to get affordable mobile entertainment. No longer. For \u00a35 a month you can delight yourself with the surreal joy of What The Golf or the strange fusion of role-playing and 1970s bar entertainment in The Pinball Wizard \u2013 and never be forced to watch another soulless mobile ad again.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only show in town of course, and Android owners can also look forward to the polished and complex physics simulation of SimpleRockets 2, Inbento\u2019s gentle and charming story-driven puzzling, and the majestic Call Of Duty: Mobile \u2013 the latest game to test the seemingly unassailable hegemony of Fortnite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimpleRockets 2 for iOS & Android, \u00a34.99 (Jundroo) The original SimpleRockets let you build, launch, and pilot spaceships. The process was simplified by putting the whole thing on a 2D plane, reducing the challenge by one whole dimension. SimpleRockets 2 brings that dimension back, its fabulously detailed physics simulation allowing for multiple stages, a variety of engines, resizable fuel tanks, and a broad range of other add-ons that will let you put a craft into orbit, and eventually go way beyond that into the solar system. If you\u2019ve played Kerbal Space Program you know exactly what to expect (minus the cute characters), but for everyone not familiar with terms like periapsis, there are tutorials that guide you from novice to space flight professional. Having all that in your pocket is a salutary reminder that we live in a wondrous age. Score: 9/10\n\nInbento for iOS & Android, \u00a32.99 (Afterburn) Here you play an endearingly drawn mother cat responsible for feeding your kitten in traditional Japanese style. That involves preparing a series of bento box meals so that they match the images in your recipe book. You do that by dragging pieces of food onto a bento box, tapping to rotate them and layering different shapes until you get the requisite pattern. The plinky plonky music and disarmingly innocent story, told through pictures-only, bely a challenge that gets steadily more interesting and testing. Score: 8/10\n\nCall of Duty: Mobile for iOS & Android, \u00a3Free (Activision) From TiMi Studios, who made the touchscreen version of PUBG, Call Of Duty: Mobile is yet another battle royale game, and one that arrives with the weight of expectation that comes with one of the world\u2019s biggest game franchises. It doesn\u2019t disappoint, and perhaps its biggest success is a control scheme that manages to recreate first person shooting in a way that won\u2019t have you swearing like a navvy. The left side of the screen moves you around, the right side aims, and the very effective default setting makes the game pull the trigger automatically whenever there\u2019s an enemy in your sights. Along with the 100 to 1 Battle Royale, there are also the familiar Domination, Team Deathmatch, and bomb-disarming Search & Destroy modes. You can even do team chat via the built-in mic, not that COD\u2019s frantic pace and shoot-everything-that-moves gameplay really needs it. And while there are microtransactions available you don\u2019t need them, adequate progress coming through just playing the game. On a phone, the screen can feel a bit cluttered with icons used to crouch, jump, lob grenades, and more, but on a tablet it\u2019s perfect. Controller support is weirdly absent, but there\u2019s very little else wrong with this excellent console conversion. Score: 8/10\n\nDread Nautical for iOS & TVos, \u00a3Free with Apple Arcade (Zen Studios) The splendidly named Dread Nautical is a turn-based roguelike set on a spooky, zombie-infested 1930s cruise liner. Choosing one of four survivors, you spend action points to move, pick things up, and attack, either melee or ranged depending on what makeshift weapons you\u2019ve managed to purloin. As you explore the ship, which gradually opens up as you cycle through repeated runs, you meet and attempt to recruit fellow survivors, whose relationship with your character and likelihood of them helping you is strongly influenced by your conversational choices. You\u2019ll also need to scavenge bandages to heal wounds, and food to feed each survivor at the end of every run. There\u2019s voice-acting throughout, dozens of different enemies to dispatch, and a scattering of larger, trickier boss monsters. Score: 8/10\n\nWord Laces for iOS & TVos, \u00a3Free with Apple Arcade (MiniMega Games) In Word Laces, you tie together sets of letters to form words based on a central picture that offers you a clue as to their general theme. Making words means zigzagging left and right, connecting up the different letters and word fragments with a pair of chunky cartoon shoelaces. It\u2019s laughably easy to start with, but that doesn\u2019t last long. As you progress words get longer, featuring far more abstruse letter groupings, and although it can\u2019t quite muster the rampant addiction of Alpha Bears, it offers a decent word-based challenge. Score: 6/10\n\nWhat The Golf for iOS & TVos, \u00a3Free with Apple Arcade (The Label) Channelling the chaotic spirit of Katamari Damacy, What The Golf lets you play golf, occasionally using clubs, and absolutely never in the way you might imagine. This is a game in which golf balls are in short supply. Instead you\u2019ll be hurling all sorts of surreal bric-a-brac towards the flag. A cat, buildings, dozens of bent golf clubs moving simultaneously, a sofa, and all this while exploring an underground laboratory. As a golf ball. Video game and cultural references abound in its playfully inventive courses, which jauntily switch from portrait to landscape in a game that revels in its continual ability to surprise. Score: 8/10\n\nRed Reign for iOS & TVos, \u00a3Free with Apple Arcade (Ninja Kiwi) Red Reign has you chopping wood to upgrade your stockade and mining gold to recruit troops and attack your opponent\u2019s fort at the other end of the level, capturing resource production buildings along the way. Once your troops have been set in motion they\u2019re out of your control, so ensuring you reserve enough gold to recruit more defenders after sending off a raiding party is crucial, otherwise you can find yourself swiftly overwhelmed by a well-timed counterattack. It\u2019s very simple, but there\u2019s a level of learning involved in when to boost wood and gold production; when to upgrade your defences, barracks, and walls; and which path your raiders should take. It\u2019s very throwaway but the lightly tactical gameplay is still breezy fun. Score: 6/10\n\nThe Pinball Wizard for iOS & TVos, \u00a3Free with Apple Arcade (Frosty Pop) Featuring a literal pinball wizard, a rotund magician whom you flick and catapult around levels using sets of wooden flippers at the bottom of each room, this is part role-playing game and part highly eccentric pinball game. Rooms are grouped into floors, each of which is a level in a tower you work your way up. In each one you\u2019ll need to knock out enemies to snag keys and bonuses before finding the exit door and tapping your rotund sorcerer through it. If your ball-like warlock slips between the flippers he falls, taking damage equivalent to his height up the tower. You can recharge health with heart containers, and by getting him through the exit in time, but progress is cemented with the treasure and XP you earn, which permanently unlocks new skills, helping you get even higher next go. All of which is enjoyably addictive. Score: 8/10\n\nAgent Intercept for iOS & TVos, \u00a3Free with Apple Arcade (PikPok) Looking effortlessly stylish, your flat-shaded spy car swoops through elegant-looking landscapes, unleashing massive powerslides and guided missiles at baddies \u2013 who happen to be the only other people on the road. The road will occasionally eject you over water, your car automatically transforming into a speedboat so the action can continue unabated, and while boats have slightly more drifty handling, watery sections have no dramatic effect on gameplay. In other words it\u2019s a clone of 1983 coin-op Spy Hunter, but unfortunately what you see in the first minute of the tutorial is all there really is to it, with relatively little nuance to uncover. As mindless entertainment its daily missions are a brief diversion, but little more. Score: 5/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Apple Arcade game review round-up \u2013 from ChuChu Rocket to Assemble With Care\n\nMORE: Apple spending $500 million on Apple Arcade exclusives claims report\n\nMORE: Best new mobile games on iOS and Android \u2013 September 2019 round-up", "description": "GameCentral looks at the month\u2019s best mobile games, from the surprisingly good Call Of Duty: Mobile to the latest Apple Arcade gems.", "authors": ["Nick Gillet"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/call-of-duty-mobile-6318_1570803629.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
