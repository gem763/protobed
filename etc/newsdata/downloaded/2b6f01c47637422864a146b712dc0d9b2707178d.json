But the incumbent emerged from Monday's election weakened as his party lost seats and Trudeau will lead a minority government.\n\nThe quick declaration of Trudeau\u2019s victory came as a surprise after he was deadlocked in the polls with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer during the six-week campaign. Still, with a minority government, Trudeau will need to forge alliances with other parties to advance his priorities.\n\nThe crowd had barely begun gathering at Liberal headquarters in Montreal when the unexpectedly early victory call arrived. Dozens of people in a mostly empty convention hall began chanting, \u201cFour more years.\u201d\n\nIn a speech that unusually took place while both Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh were also speaking to supporters, Trudeau defiantly voiced the messages he had taken across the country, while also extending an olive branch to Western provinces that roundly rejected him.\n\n\u201cKnow that you are an essential part of this country,\u201d Trudeau said, referencing Alberta and Saskatchewan. \u201cLet us all work hard to bring our great country together.\u201d\n\nTo win, Trudeau survived numerous controversies, including revelations by Time Magazine in September that he wore blackface to a costume party in 2001 while he taught at a private school. That prompted the prime minister to admit to another instance, while a third was quickly publicized. The SNC-Lavalin scandal has also dogged Trudeau this year, particularly after the country\u2019s ethics commissioner determined his office tried to shield the engineering company from criminal prosecution.\n\nTrudeau apologized for donning black- and brownface, but in the SNC-Lavalin case he said he was defending Canadian jobs.\n\nHis supporters' exuberance at the surprisingly clear mandate glossed over the reality that the Liberals will have a harder time governing with a parliamentary minority \u2014 and minority governments tend to last only about two years, not four.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trudeau told voters they had a choice between a progressive agenda on climate change and social services or a Scheer-led government that would end the carbon tax while having no targets for emission reductions. But Trudeau risked losing support from Canadians demanding climate action after approving the purchase of the Trans Mountain Pipeline.\n\nThe Parliament should have easily enough votes to ratify President Donald Trump\u2019s new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as Liberals and Conservatives have both said they\u2019ll vote for it and hold an overwhelming majority of seats.\n\nThe prime minister has said his first action will be tax cuts for the middle class, or those earning less than $147,000 a year, by raising levels of tax-free income.\n\nOne potential wildcard is whether the other opposition parties will pull Trudeau aggressively to the left in exchange for their support on bills. Those other opposition parties, the New Democratic Party and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, have criticized the USMCA and also support aggressive action on climate change.\n\nIn Regina, Sask., where Scheer and his supporters gathered, the already-subdued election night event went silent as the CBC News broadcast called a Liberal-led government. Party organizers quickly changed the channel to another news network, but soon others began calling the election for the Liberals.\n\nScheer used his concession speech to position Conservatives as the party in waiting to lead Canada once Trudeau\u2019s Liberals stumble. \"Tonight, Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\" he said in Regina. \"And Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\u201d\n\nThe International Trade Centre auditorium, filled with hundreds of Conservative supporters, would erupt in applause and cheers whenever the results for Scheer\u2019s riding of Regina-Qu\u2019Appelle crossed the projection screen showing multiple newscasts. Only when results were aired for Regina-Wascana, where Conservative candidate Michael Kram unseated longtime Liberal MP Ralph Goodale, would the crowd react with more exuberance. They also cheered when People\u2019s Party of Canada Leader \u2014 and former Conservative \u2014 Maxime Bernier was declared unseated by the Conservative candidate in the Quebec riding of Beauce.\n\nBernier, a former foreign minister who hoped to lead a populist movement, lost his own seat in an embarrassing and emphatic setback for Canada's would-be Donald Trump.\n\nLauren Gardner contributed to this report from Regina, Sask.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "The Canadian prime minister demonstrated surprising strength at the polls.", "authors": ["Alexander Panetta", "Lauren Gardner", "Catherine Boudreau"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176662990-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
