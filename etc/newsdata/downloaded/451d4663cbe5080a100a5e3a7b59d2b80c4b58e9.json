Hence too the dramatic urgency of a Saturday sitting. Hence dishing out a think 500 plus page legal text on the very morning of the \"meaningful vote\", and when there to be complex arguments about its terms. Hence the whipping. Hence the bogus promises given to all sides.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Johnson will most likely follow his own Thatcherite instincts and not those of the Labour old left. Hence, too, the refusal to publish the accompanying legal advice and a fresh economic assessment of the damage his deal will do, though the country deserves to know how many jobs will be lost under the Johnson plan, cooked up a bunch of ideologies who want to relive the 1980s.\n\nThe Johnson deal can morph (indeed, is designed to evolve) quite easily into no deal when the transition period ends in 2020, or 2021. That needs to be outlawed via a new Benn Act. The arrangements for Northern Ireland need to be tested legally against the Belfast Good Friday Agreement. The deal needs to be put to the people for a Final Say. The Johnson deal will soon unravel.\n\nThe holes and contradictions and obfuscations in the Johnson deal represent the seeds of its own destruction. It is promising too many things to many people that cannot be simultaneously true. The Letwin amendment gives parliament and people the time and space to look through the Johnson deal and discover its true and often horrifying nature. It puts into slow motion the conjuror Johnson\u2019s sleight of hand. It will make ministers account for their policy before granting the deal parliamentary approval.\n\nAbove all it will give the voters the ability to fully understand \u2013 for the first time in fact \u2013 to understand what Brexit really means, to make their own judgement and to choose their destiny in the final say referendum which remains the only way out of the Brexit crisis.", "description": "Boris Johnson must always have known that his best tactic to get his Brexit deal through Parliament was to bounce the Commons into accepting it.
