The protesters reportedly involved families -- including women, children and the elderly.\n\nAuthorities were seen using a water cannon filled with stinging blue dye to blast protesters, who barricaded streets at multiple areas in Kowloon, as well as outside an area mosque. The spray reportedly left bystanders choking and vomiting, according to the outlet.\n\nDuring the rally, protesters also trashed local businesses they perceived as pro-Beijing.\n\nAs the demonstration continued into late Sunday afternoon, protesters were seen tearing up bricks and throwing them -- as well as Molotov cocktails -- at police stations, setting barricades on fire and smashing up subway stations, according to the Washington Post.\n\nPolice countered the protests throughout the day by using tear gas to violently disperse the crowds.\n\nSome of the protesters were seen using power tools to construct sturdier barricades they hoped would hold back police more efficiently.\n\nBROOKLYN NETS FANS TARGET LEBRON JAMES, SUPPORT HONG KONG IN BARCLAYS CENTER PROTEST\n\nMany wore masks in defiance of a recent ban on face coverings at public gatherings, which authorities implemented because they consider facial recognition technology a powerful tool in finding protesters.\n\nOrganizers said they wanted to use their right to protest as guaranteed by the city's constitution despite the risk of arrest.\n\n\"We're using peaceful, rational, nonviolent ways to voice our demands,\" Figo Chan, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, told reporters. \"We're not afraid of being arrested. What I'm most scared of is everyone giving up on our principles.\"\n\nThe group has organized some of the movement's biggest protest marches. One of its leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked on Wednesday by assailants wielding hammers.\n\nOn Saturday, Hong Kong police arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a teenage activist who was distributing leaflets near a wall plastered with pro-democracy messages. A witness told local broadcaster RTHK that the assailant shouted afterward that Hong Kong is \"a part of China\" and other pro-Beijing messages.\n\nThe protest movement sprang out of opposition to a government proposal for an extradition bill that would have sent suspects to mainland China to stand trial, and then ballooned into broader demands for full democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.\n\nCLICK FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to the report", "description": "Thousands of pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters took to the streets on Sunday, some throwing firebombs as police attempted to violently\u00a0disperse the situation using tear gas and a water cannon.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19293350042279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
