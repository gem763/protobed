Results were released as part of Covering Climate Now, a collaboration of more than 250 U.S. and global news outlets with a combined audience of more than 1 billion people.\n\nThe results also hit ahead of a major United Nations climate summit in New York on Sept. 23.\n\nThere is a consensus among distinguished climate scientists that the world is heating up due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels for power and transportation. Forest loss is another key area under watch, including after recent fires in the Amazon Rainforest. Still, 44%, less than half, of the CBS poll respondents said human activity was a major contributor to climate change. More than a quarter said human impact was minor or nonexistent.\n\nIt\u2019s clear there\u2019s a divide when it comes to assessing the field of study. According to the CBS poll, 52% of Americans say \u201cscientists agree that humans are a main cause\u201d of the climate crisis, with 48% claiming there is disagreement among experts.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: I\u2019m a conservative Republican. Climate change is real\u2019: Rep. Rooney\n\nPolitical affiliation is another determining factor, at least according this poll. Nearly seven in 10 Democratic voters say they believe that humans significantly influence the climate and 80% want immediate action, just 20% of Republicans think humans are a primary cause and barely a quarter want rapid action.\n\nOn the science, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said almost all experts agree that humans are driving climate change, with 29% of Republicans saying the same.\n\nAge matters, as well. Two-thirds of Republican voters aged under 45 consider it their duty to address the climate crisis, according to the CBS poll. Just 38% of Republicans 45 and above feel the same.\n\nRead: Number of young Republicans concerned about environment jumps in last five years\n\nViews of how the Trump administration is handling the environment are related to partisanship. Most Republicans give the president at least a \u201cgood\u201d rating on the environment (a third say he is doing an \u201cexcellent\u201d job), while eight in 10 Democrats say he is doing a poor job.\n\nWhile the administration has rolled back regulations to cut emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from power and industrial plants and pushed for more coal use, wide shares of Americans say they want just the opposite, according to a separate poll released last week from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nAbout two out of three Americans asked in that query said corporations have a responsibility to combat climate change, and a similar share also say it\u2019s the job of the U.S. government.\n\nRead: Democrats\u2019 fracking ban would hurt U.S. economy, give edge to Russia: IEA\u2019s Birol\n\nThe Trump administration is poised on Wednesday to revoke California\u2019s authority to set auto mileage standards, asserting that only the federal government has the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy, the Associated Press and other news outlets reported. The move comes after the Justice Department recently opened an antitrust investigation into a deal between California and four automakers \u2014 Ford F, -0.22% Volkswagen, BMW and Honda HMC, -0.07% \u2014 for tougher pollution and related mileage requirements than those sought by President Donald Trump.\n\nOne particular plan being advanced by some Democratic leaders \u2014 the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2014 is met with skepticism from many Americans. Just 15% of Americans in the CBS poll describe the Green New Deal as a good plan that encompasses what\u2019s needed to address climate change. Another 26% say it is has both desirable and undesirable features, but they believe its promotion at least kicks off valuable discussions on climate change. Twenty-four percent say it is a bad plan and not what is needed to address climate change, while about a third haven\u2019t heard enough about it to form an opinion yet.\n\nAbout half of the field of roughly 20 Democratic challengers backs a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d in some form. Some are adding their own features to the pact rolled out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress earlier this year. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar all signed off on the Green New Deal legislation.\n\nFuture Returns: What would the Green New Deal mean to investors?\n\nRegardless of concern over climate change, there appears to be skepticism among Americans about how much humans can do about it.\n\nJust 19% said humans can stop rising temperatures and the associated impacts, with nearly half thinking it possible to slow but not stop the changes and 23% refusing to believe humans can do anything at all, the CBS poll said.", "description": "The Democratic National Committee may have voted down a national debate centered only on climate issues, but voters aren\u2019t about to let the issue fade, a CBS...", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GE587_Climat_ZG_20180228150126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
