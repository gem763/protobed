It is derived from vitamin A which can increase cell turnover and encourage the production of collagen, improving the appearance of sun damage, lines, acne, scars and dark spots, while evening out tone and texture.\n\nBe careful, though, because overuse can cause dryness and irritation, particularly for more sensitive skin types. If your skin can cope with it, however, you can use a retinol every day \u2013 vary your usage to see what works for you.\n\nAnd they're not only suitable for mature skin: we recommend catching signs of ageing early and starting with regular retinol use in your late 20s or early 30s. It can also make skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it's best use at night. Make sure you follow up with your usual SPF in the morning.\n\nEach of our favourites has been tested for at least two weeks on a range of skin types and ages, looking for visible reduction in fine lines and tone, smoother skin texture and any adverse effects.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

This is a great place to start if you\u2019re new to retinol and want a fair-price, good-results entry product.\n\nBuy now\n\nLa Roche-Posay redermic anti-ageing concentrate intense: \u00a324, Feel Unique\n\nCompared to a lot of retinol products, which are notoriously expensive, La Roche-Posay\u2019s delivers great results without the matching price tag. Our tester\u2019s skin was having a small crisis \u2013 dehydrated, rough and breaking out \u2013 but this \"sorted it right out\u201d within three weeks of daily use, with zero irritation.\n\nBuy now\n\nMurad Retinol youth renewal night cream: \u00a365, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThere is not a single dud product in the extensive Retinol range from the US dermatological brand. This is a night cream that isn\u2019t super heavy or oily, and skin is left feeling silky, fresh and well-rested in the morning. Plus, our tester\u2019s usually sensitive skin didn\u2019t show any signs of redness or irritation.\n\nBuy now\n\nREN bio retinoid anti-ageing cream: \u00a345, Look Fantastic\n\nREN\u2019s bio retinoid (a moisturiser rather than a serum or oil) is a winning combo of mid-range price, minimal fuss and very good results. Our tester\u2019s mature skin felt firmer and brighter and she saw a marked improvement in the lines around her brow and mouth.\n\nBuy now\n\nZelens power A high potency vitamin A treatment drops: \u00a3120, John Lewis & Partners\n\nOur tester found that this smelt fantastic \u2013 lightly fragranced and not at all overpowering \u2013 and the pipette is easy to control to dispense the small amount necessary, cutting out waste. Skin was smoother and pronounced lines were reduced, but everyday use caused irritation after a couple of weeks, so we recommend limiting use to three times a week.\n\nBuy now\n\nSunday Riley A+ dose retinol serum: \u00a370, Cult Beauty\n\nSunday Riley\u2019s A+ dose retinol is very strong, containing a 6.5 per cent retinoid blend, but it\u2019s incredibly effective in reducing redness and scarring, and our tester (who is a seasoned retinol user) experienced no irritation. It\u2019s a wonder product for improving the appearance of acne scars, and general brightening and tightening.\n\nBuy now\n\nHoly Grail retinol repair skin creme: \u00a323.99, Holy Grail\n\nHoly Grail\u2019s line is minimalist in both packaging and products \u2013 it features just four essentials. It\u2019s retinol cream is a lightweight moisturiser with one per cent retinol, plus hyaluronic acid and aloe vera. We particularly love it for sensitive skin, but it\u2019s price point will appeal to all.\n\nBuy now\n\nDr Dennis Gross ferulic + retinol wrinkle recovery overnight serum: \u00a388, Dr Dennis Gross\n\nThis, from the New York dermatologist brand, may be pricey but its results are undeniable: texture and elasticity was noticeably improved after using for just a week on mature skin. As well as retinol, it contains ferulic acid, which both boosts the powers of the retinol and protects skin against further environmental free-radical damage.\n\nBuy now\n\nElizabeth Arden retinol ceramide capsules line erasing night serum: \u00a342, Elizabeth Arden\n\nTo guarantee the product you\u2019re using is at utmost potency (many ingredients degrade from bottles being opened and closed regularly, or housed in clear containers), Elizabeth Arden\u2019s retinol comes in individual, biodegradable capsules that you tear into each use.\n\nIt claims to be 76 per cent more potent than non-encapsulated retinol, but while we can't be quite so exacting in our testing, we found that it had a lovely velvety texture on application, skin was noticeably plumper immediately after use and texture noticeably improved after a week.\n\nBuy now\n\nEstee Lauder perfectionist pro rapid renewal retinol treatment: \u00a363, Feel Unique\n\nApart from being suckers for its oh-so-shiny silver tube, we also love rapid renewal retinol\u2019s quick smoothing and brightening effects, and the speed with which it set to work on long-established lines around our tester\u2019s forehead and mouth. It also contains plumping hyaluronic acid and antioxidants to protect against environmental damage.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Retinol products\n\nIf you\u2019re coming to retinol with no previous experience, start with Indeed Labs \u2013 it scores highly across the board and comes at a give-it-a-go-friendly price, too.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
