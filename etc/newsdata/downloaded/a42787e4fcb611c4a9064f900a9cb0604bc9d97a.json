If a deal with the EU is agreed at the European council summit next week, the government will have just over a week to get it approved by parliament and enacted in law before 31 October. MPs will likely have to sit at the weekend and late into the night to pass the necessary legislation.\n\nAhead of the speech, Mr Johnson said: \u201cGetting Brexit done by 31 October is absolutely crucial, and we are continuing to work on an exit deal so we can move on to negotiating a future relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation with our European friends.\n\n\u201cBut the people of this country don\u2019t just want us to sort out Brexit. They want their NHS to be stronger, their streets safer, their wifi faster, the air they breathe cleaner, their kids\u2019 schools better-funded \u2013 and this optimistic and ambitious Queen\u2019s Speech sets us on a course to make all that happen, and more besides.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAfter one of the least-active parliaments in living memory, the proposals we are bringing forward will get this country moving again. This is a Queen\u2019s Speech that will deliver for every corner of the UK and make this, once again, the greatest place on earth.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is good to see progress, but we will wait to see if this is a genuine breakthrough. We are a long way from a final deal and the weekend and next week remain critical to leaving with a deal on 31 October. We remain prepared to leave without a deal on 31 October.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s hopes of securing parliament\u2019s approval for an agreement were dealt a blow on Saturday when Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, warned that the proposal reportedly being discussed \u201cwill not work\u201d.\n\nThe plan would see Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, remain in the EU customs union after Brexit. But Mr Dodds told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: \u201cNorthern Ireland must stay in a full UK customs union, full stop.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of stuff coming from Brussels, pushed by the Europeans in the last hours, but one thing is sure: Northern Ireland must remain fully part of the UK customs union. And Boris Johnson knows it very well.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt cannot work because Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson announced on Saturday that the Queen\u2019s Speech will also include a new law to tackle air pollution and reduce the use of plastics.\n\nThe new Environment Bill will succeed the 1956 Clean Air Act and is expected to include a legally-binding limit for the most dangerous types of air pollution.\n\nHowever, the exact threshold is likely to be subject to a consultation, meaning it is not clear how tough the new law will be.\n\nThe legislation is also expected to force companies to cover the entire cost of collecting and recycling their packaging, while local councils will also be given new duties.\n\nAnd it will pave the way for the introduction of deposit return schemes for drinks bottles, and the creation of a new Office for Environmental Protection.\n\nMr Johnson told The Times: \u201cThis landmark legislation will set a framework of far-reaching, legally binding targets to reduce plastics, restore biodiversity, improve the quality of our water and clean up our air.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson has pledged\u00a0to place Brexit at the heart of Monday\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech as he prepares to brief his cabinet on the prospects of a deal with the EU.
