Salazar has in the past denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSeveral members of NOP are competing in the 2019 IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar.\n\nNone of the athletes Salazar has worked with were mentioned in Monday\u2019s report.\n\nSalazar stopped coaching Farah in 2017 when the runner decided to move back to England. Farah said at the time that the doping investigation was not the reason they parted ways.\n\n\u201cThe athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,\u201d Travis Tygart, USADA chief executive officer, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar and Dr. Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nSalazar, 61, was a celebrated distance runner, winning three consecutive New York City marathons starting in 1980.\n\nNike funds NOP, the nation\u2019s most elite long-distance running training center, in Portland, Oregon, under a $460 million 26-year sponsorship deal with US Track and Field.", "description": "The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency on Monday said it had banned American Alberto Salazar, who has coached some of the world's top distance runners including British Olympian track champion Mo Farah, for four years for doping violations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435743596&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901VF-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
