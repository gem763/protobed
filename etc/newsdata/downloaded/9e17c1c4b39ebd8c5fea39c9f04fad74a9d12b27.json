The most important thing for us is to have everyone healthy before going on the road.\u201d\n\nFans in South Korea will not be able to watch Tuesday\u2019s game, however, after broadcasters failed to agree a deal with North Korean authorities to show the match live.\n\nThis is the second World Cup qualifying campaign in the last decade that the two nations have been drawn to face one another.\n\nSouth and North Korea met in the third and fourth rounds of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, with the two games due to be played in North Korea relocated to Shanghai.\n\nAcross their four meetings in 2008 and 2009, three were drawn - including both games played at Shanghai\u2019s Hongkou Stadium - with South Korea winning the second meeting in Seoul 1-0 as both nations qualified for the Finals in South Africa.\n\nThat remains the only time both countries have progressed to the finals of the same World Cup.", "description": "South Korea coach Paulo Bento has told his players to be wary of a counter-attacking North Korean side ahead of Tuesday's historic meeting in Pyongyang in 2022 World Cup qualifying.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440662475&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0PF", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
