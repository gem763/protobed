He went 6-1 with a 2.65 ERA over his last 10 starts - a brilliant run that carried right into the postseason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool to see for a guy that went through what he\u2019s went through this year and where he\u2019s come back from,\u201d Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \u201cTo see him step up like that is something really special.\u201d\n\nThe best-of-five series now shifts to St. Louis, where Mike Soroka gets the ball for the Braves in Game 3 on Sunday against Adam Wainwright.\n\nGoing against St. Louis ace Jack Flaherty, who had one of the great second halves in baseball history, Foltynewicz allowed three hits, struck out seven and walked none during an 83-pitch outing that kept the Cardinals from mounting any semblance of offense.\n\nHe only allowed one runner as far as second base - and that wasn\u2019t even his fault. In the second, Yadier Molina singled and Braves second baseman Ozzie Albies extended the inning by misplaying Paul DeJong\u2019s grounder for an error.\n\nNo problem. Foltynewicz fanned Harrison Bader to end the threat.\n\nAfter Kolten Wong hit into a double play to wrap up the seventh, Duvall emerged from the dugout to hit for Foltynewicz in the bottom half. Duvall was greeted by a smattering of boos from the SunTrust Park crowd that clearly wanted Foltynewicz to go at least one more inning - especially after the Braves bullpen imploded the night before in a Game 1 loss.\n\nThe heckles turned to cheers when Duvall drove a 3-2 pitch from Flaherty into the center-field seats, giving the Braves a bit of breathing room.\n\n\u201cI heard 50,000 people let me know that they wanted Folty to stay in the game,\u201d Duvall quipped. \u201cI wanted to put together a good at-bat.\u201d\n\nDuvall spent nearly the entire season at Triple-A, where he set a franchise record with 32 homers, so it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say this as much a victory for the Gwinnett Stripers as the Braves.\n\nMax Fried, normally a starter and pitching on back-to-back days for the first time all season, breezed through the eighth before turning it over to Mark Melancon, who gave up four runs in the ninth inning of the series opener, sending the Braves to a 7-6 loss.\n\nMelancon surrendered a pair of one-out singles, drawing groans from the crowd, but he struck out Molina and Wong to earn the second postseason save of his career.\n\nYet this one will be remembered for Foltynewicz outdueling Flaherty, who had surrendered three runs only one time in 15 second-half starts.\n\nThe 23-year-old right-hander went 7-2 with an 0.91 ERA after the All-Star break, a minuscule figure surpassed only by Jake Arrieta (0.75) for the 2015 Chicago Cubs and Greg Maddux (0.87) for the 1994 Braves.\n\nFlaherty was the NL pitcher of the month for both August and September.\n\nFoltynewicz has the edge for October honors, having pulled off his own tale of two seasons.\n\n\u201cThe fact he has three pitches with command, it\u2019s always tough when you face a pitcher who has that,\u201d Wong said.\n\nGOOD COMPANY\n\nFoltynewicz joins Hall of Famers Maddux (Game 2 of the 1996 World Series) and Tom Glavine (Game 7 of the 1996 NL Championship Series) as the only Braves pitchers since 1958 to go at least seven innings in a postseason game without giving up a run or a walk.\n\nRUNNING HARD\n\nAfter being criticized for hog-dogging in Game 1, there were no issues with Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. going full speed every chance he got. The young Atlanta star sprinted down the line on a groundout in the first, and hustled for a double in the seventh on a chopper down the third-base line.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBraves: RHP Chris Martin was replaced on the 25-man roster by Julio Teheran. Martin strained his left oblique on his very first warmup pitch while preparing to pitch in the eighth inning of Game 1. He\u2019ll miss the rest of this series, as well as the NL Championship Series should the Braves advance.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Braves haven\u2019t led in a postseason series since they were up 2-1 in the 2002 NLDS against San Francisco. Atlanta wound up losing the final two games to the Giants - part of a streak of nine straight playoff series losses that is only one away from the Chicago Cubs\u2019 record for postseason futility.\n\nSoroka (13-4, 2.68 ERA) has been especially tough on the road (7-1, 1.55 ERA), which is why the Braves held him back until Game 3. This battle of the ages pits the 22-year-old right-hander against the 38-year-old Wainwright (14-10, 4.29 ERA), who began his career in the Braves organization before a trade to the Cardinals in 2003.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Adding another chapter to his remarkable turnaround season, Mike Foltynewicz threw seven dominating innings before pinch-hitter Adam Duvall hit a two-run homer that carried the Atlanta Braves to a 3-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Friday, evening the NL Division Series at one game apiece.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/nlds_cardinals_braves_baseball_69397_c0-179-4284-2676_s1770x1032.jpg?64bc8c2a76b50220683ad14c93dc0b3a630f2414", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
