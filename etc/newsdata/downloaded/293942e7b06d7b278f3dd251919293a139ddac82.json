This is the second time this year the Fed has lowered rates. However, the central bank dampened market expectations by steering clear of signalling further rate cuts this year.", "description": "U.S. government debt prices were higher Thursday morning, after the Fed failed to signal further rate cuts this year, disappointing market expectations.", "authors": ["Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106088572-1566331895306bond.jpg?v=1566331935", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
