Here I am in the semi-finals. It\u2019s super important to me. It means everything.\u201d\n\nNadal led 4-love in the opener before an abruptly wayward forehand enabled the 5ft 7in Argentine to level at 4-all, prompting chants of \u201col\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9\u201d from the rollicking late-night crowd in Queens. It was the same for the second set, where a sudden glut of misfires from the forehand side allowed Schwartzman to push it to 5-all from 1-5 down.\n\nBut the muscular Mallorcan, who pounded 35 winners and broke serve eight times, was able to clamp down on the critical points in each session to stake a commanding two-sets-to-none lead over the 27-year-old from Buenos Aires.\n\n\u201cLike a lion in the jungle,\u201d Schwartzman said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter. He knows how to play the important moments every single time. I played [him] eight times, and every important moment he played better than me.\u201d\n\nThe 33-year-old was visited early in the final set by the trainer, who spent the changeover rubbing cream into his left forearm. He spent the next several games flexing the other forearm on the baseline, but fears of cramping were quickly dispelled as he won the last four games on the trot to wrap up a competitive but straightforward third and book a spot in the last four, where he will be the betting favourite to add to his 2010, 2014 and 2017 titles at the season-ending major.\n\n\u201cPhysically I am fine,\u201d said Nadal, who has reached the semi-finals of all four majors in the same year for the second time in his career and first since 2008. \u201cToday was a very heavy day. Big humidity. I am this kind of player where I sweat a bit. Sometimes under these conditions it\u2019s tough, but honestly I am happy that I had some critical moments at the end of the second and the beginning of the third.\u201d\n\nAfter both Federer and top-seeded Novak Djokovic were eliminated in upsets earlier in the week, Nadal\u2019s win on a humid New York night ensured at least one of the sport\u2019s Big Three would be represented in the semi-finals for a 62nd consecutive grand slam tournament.\n\nThe world No 2 advances to a Friday meeting with 24th-seeded Matteo Berrettini, who outlasted Gael Monfils in a five-set thriller earlier on Wednesday to become the first Italian man to reach the US Open semi-finals since 1977. The winner of their match will face either fifth-seeded Daniil Medvedev or 78th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov in Sunday\u2019s final.\n\n\u201cBerrettini is having a great year,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cHe\u2019s in semi-finals, winning a lot of good matches, so what you can expect in a semi-finals of a grand slam match? You can\u2019t expect an easy opponent. You can\u2019t expect an easy match.\u201d", "description": "Rafael Nadal overcame a spirited challenge from Argentina\u2019s Diego Schwartzman to remain on course for a fourth US Open title", "authors": ["Bryan Armen Graham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/236c2881f2aab4a6736b0e17c8dda8e07f353b2d/0_602_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77c818fa3d5b45b7f427dca12b4c0df4", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
