Once support broke, continued to be much weaker than the for a few years.\n\nThe ratio started creating a rising channel (B) in 2016/2017, as higher lows started forming. These higher lows reflected that gold was outperforming USD.\n\nThe rally over the past couple of years has the ratio testing the top of rising channel (B) and the underside of falling channel (A) at (1).\n\nIt appears that a very important long-term breakout test is in play, with momentum at the highest level in 8 years.\n\nHow the ratio handles this breakout test will send gold and a very important long-term message.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Chris Kimble covering: XAU/USD, XAG/USD, US Dollar Index Futures, Gold Futures.
