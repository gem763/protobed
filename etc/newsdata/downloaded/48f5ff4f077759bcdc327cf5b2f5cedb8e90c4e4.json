That can be upsetting,\" Scott said.\n\nFigure out how you envision your future family life\n\nYou and your partner should discuss if you want to raise your kids to be religious, live in a specific place, or have a certain lifestyle. fstop123/Getty Images\n\nFirst, it's important you and your partner candidly discuss your family-related goals in life. Perhaps the most obvious element of this topic is whether or not you want to have children, but often people forget family planning extends far beyond a yes or no answer.\n\nAccording to Scott, it's also important to discuss when you want to have kids and how you want to raise them, including whether both parents stay at home with the kids, you take turns, or one person has daytime kid-watching duties.\n\nIt's also a good idea to consider if you and your partner want to raise your kids to be religious, live in a specific place, or have a certain lifestyle, like being a vegan family.\n\nRead more: If you're the victim of an affair, you might want to revenge cheat. A therapist says the move could ruin your relationship for good.\n\nFamily also extends beyond babies. As soon-to-be-married couples often learn quickly, they have to settle on how involved their in-laws and extended family members are in their relationship.\n\nAs your partner's parents or your own grow older, for example, would you want them to live with you, or would you prefer a different arrangement? And before that, it's important to have a solid understanding of how often you and your partner want to spend time with your extended families, on holidays or otherwise.\n\nTalk about how money will be made, used, and saved\n\nYou should discuss these topics even if you don't plan on having kids or buying a home for many years. Shutterstock\n\nIn addition to family-related chats, you and your partner should also discuss money matters.\n\nResearch has shown that money-related arguments are some of the hardest ones for couples to rebound from because these fights last longer than fights about other topics. Additionally, when a couple fights about money, they tend to use harsher language towards each other.\n\nAccording to Hafeez, all couples should discuss their investment goals and what she calls \"big ticket items\" that they want to save for together, like a house, car, or starting a family. If only one partner cares about a certain investment, it's important to discuss how that will affect your relationship.\n\nYou should also discuss who will be making money and spending it, Hafeez said. Will you have a shared bank account, for example, and if you do, how much will each person contribute? Then, if you plan to have a family, you'll have to decide whether you'll need to invest in a nanny so both of you can work to support the family, or if just one of you will have an income.\n\nRead more: How to know if someone is a serial cheater or if they've actually made a mistake, according to a therapist\n\nEven if you don't plan on having kids or buying a home for many years, knowing what you and your partner both value in life can help you better understand which areas you see eye-to-eye on and which needs compromise to work.\n\nIn the worst case, you may realize your life goals are too different for your relationship to pan out. Still, like Scott said, it's better to learn this sooner than later.\n\nLastly, Scott said it's important couples continue to discuss their stances on these make-or-break topics every few years since people's views can change and therefore need to be rehashed and readjusted so the couple can stay on the same page.", "description": "You could be wasting your time on a dead-end relationship if you're not on the same page about financial and family matters.", "authors": ["Julia Naftulin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d979d195d21aa14e3601394?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
