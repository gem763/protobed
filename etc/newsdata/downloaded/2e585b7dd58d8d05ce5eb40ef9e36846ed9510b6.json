(Photo: Getty Images / SDI Productions)\n\nThe Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles card was designed for business owners who are always on the go. If your business tends to spend a lot on travel\u2014particularly, hotels and car rentals\u2014but your other expenses are all over the map, this card can help you stack up rewards and redeem them for stuff you'll actually use. And for a limited time, this card offers a supercharged sign-up bonus worth up to $2,000\u2014a win for any business.\n\nWe\u2019ve chosen the Capital One Spark Miles card as one of the best cards to strike a balance between offering both travel and business perks. It's ideal if your business doesn't want to commit to a particular airline or hotel and can take advantage of the card's travel features. Plus, employee cards come with tracking features, customized spending limits and no annual fee. The Capital One Spark Miles card allows you to choose travel deals based on what's best for your business, no matter where that takes you.\n\nCapital One Spark Miles (Photo: Reviewed / Naidin Concul-Ticas)\n\nAnnual Fee: $0 for first year, $95 after; $0 for employee cards\n\n$0 for first year, $95 after; $0 for employee cards Introductory APR: None\n\nNone Regular APR: 18.74% (Variable)\n\n18.74% (Variable) Miles: 5x miles on hotel and rental car bookings through Capital One Travel; 2x miles on every other purchase\n\n5x miles on hotel and rental car bookings through Capital One Travel; 2x miles on every other purchase Balance Transfer Fee: None\n\nNone Balance Transfer APR: 18.74%\n\n18.74% Foreign Transaction Fees: None\n\nNone Sign-up bonus: 50,000 bonus miles after spending $5,000 within the first three months of account opening, and another 150,000 bonus miles after spending $50,000 total within the first six months\n\nWho should get the Capital One Spark Miles?\n\nThis card is a clear winner for business owners who prize travel perks. However, you need excellent personal credit to qualify for the card. Generally, that means your credit score is in the mid-700s or above and you've established a strong credit history with a record of making on-time payments.\n\nWhat miles can you get with the Capital One Spark Miles?\n\nNo matter what you're purchasing with the card, you'll earn a solid rewards rate: 5x miles on all hotel and rental car bookings through the Capital One Travel portal and an unlimited 2x miles on all other purchases. That's hard to beat on most business rewards cards, which typically offer a meager rate on everyday purchases and set a dollar limit on how much you can earn in the bonus categories.\n\nHowever, as with any rewards card, earning all those miles won't mean much until you redeem them. It may seem unheard-of to leave miles on the table, but according to a 2017 survey by Bankrate.com, about 31% of credit card holders have never redeemed their card rewards. That could leave your ROI at zilch. But with the Capital One Spark Miles card, there are four easy ways to redeem your miles:\n\nUse Purchase Eraser.

Each mile is worth 1 cent each when redeemed for travel\u2014meaning the sign-up bonus could be worth a mouthwatering $2,000.\n\nNot every business can spend $50,000, but it could be a realistic target if you're just getting your business established and need to buy all the startup essentials.\n\nWhat drawbacks does the Capital One Spark Miles have?\n\nThere are a couple of caveats you should consider before signing up for this card.\n\nFirst off, the Capital One Spark Miles comes with an annual fee, which is $0 in the first year and $95 thereafter (although employee cards are always free). That means you'll need to figure out if you use the card's rewards and perks enough to justify paying that fee after the first year.\n\nAdditionally, the bonus category does come with a limitation. You'll only earn 5 miles per dollar spent on purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. From time to time, you may find better deals outside of the portal and will have to choose between earning the bonus rewards rate or taking advantage of the better deal and earning a lower rewards rate.\n\nHow does the Capital One Spark Miles rate in our rankings?\n\nWe see the Capital One Spark Miles card as an excellent pick for business owners\u2014but every enterprise has different needs. If you're looking for a more flexible rewards program or you're willing to pony up a higher annual fee, then check out our list of the best business credit cards. And if you consider yourself part of the gig economy instead, look to our list of best credit cards for freelancers.\n\nThings to know about all business credit cards\n\nMost business credit cards require the business owner to make a personal guarantee, which means you'll personally foot the bill if your business can't pay for it. This limits the risk a card issuer takes on when it extends a line of credit. The Capital One Spark Miles card asks for a personal guarantee, so be sure you understand this responsibility before applying for the card.\n\nAdditionally, APRs and credit limits vary based on your individual credit. Credit limits and interest rates for each card are determined based on each cardholder's personal situation, so we didn't consider those factors when evaluating these cards. But if you pay off your card in full every month, you won't have to worry about interest.\n\nKeep this in mind, too: Banks have final say on who they accept for a credit card. Card issuers decide who they will approve using criteria including, but not always limited to, an individual's credit score when evaluating each applicant.\n\nSo should you get the Capital One Spark Miles?\n\nIf your business requires a lot of travel and you plan to use the Capital One Travel portal to book most of your hotels and car rentals, then this card is a no-brainer. The 5x miles in the bonus category is highly generous, and the double miles on all other purchases is a solid rate, too. With a suite of business resources alongside travel perks and a hefty sign-up bonus, the Spark Miles is a solid all-around business credit card.\n\nWhen you sign up for one of these cards, Reviewed may receive an affiliate commission from The Points Guy Affiliate Network.\n\nOther top credit card options\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
