H.R. McMaster was a pragmatic stickler who valued the customary interagency deliberations that shaped decision making at the National Security Council, and which President Trump found tedious and distracting.\n\nThe president let him go in favor of his diametric opposite, John Bolton, a notoriously hawkish and obstreperous ideologue who was happy to let the council\u2019s customs wither \u2014 the better to speak his truth to the president directly. His ideological maneuvering eventually got him fired, though he lasted an improbable 17 months.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nIn Robert O\u2019Brien, chosen Wednesday as Mr. Bolton\u2019s replacement, the president seems to have found a compliant, behind-the-scenes worker bee better suited to Mr. Trump\u2019s domineering temperament. His appointment may signal the death knell of any hope to check the president\u2019s worst foreign-policy impulses.\n\nMr. O\u2019Brien, who most recently served as the government\u2019s chief hostage negotiator, wrote a book in 2016 titled \u201cWhile America Slept: Restoring American Leadership to a World in Crisis.\u201d In it, he lays out a hawkish worldview not all that dissimilar from Mr. Bolton\u2019s. But he has also lavished praise on his boss, declaring that Mr. Trump\u2019s muscular foreign policy had produced \u201cunparalleled success\u201d in freeing American hostages.\n\nNot every national security adviser needs to shout; some of the most effective have been quiet masters at pulling bureaucratic levers. The problem is, Mr. O\u2019Brien doesn\u2019t seem like much of a lever puller \u2014 and in any case there are far fewer levers to pull. The National Security Council has atrophied under Mr. Trump, and especially during Mr. Bolton\u2019s tenure.\n\nInstead, Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s appointment is likely to mean that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will continue to be the president\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, a role he usurped from Mr. Bolton. Unfortunately, Secretary Pompeo has succeeded precisely because he seems to have few if any principles that he won\u2019t suppress for the sake of holding and wielding executive power. The Ed McMahon of American foreign policy, he is smart enough to be in on the Trump joke, doesn\u2019t care that it\u2019s not funny and laughs anyway.\n\nSome have suggested that Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo have formed a foreign-policy partnership comparable to that of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, and that, therefore, we shouldn\u2019t worry about who sits atop the National Security Council. But Mr. Kissinger is an elite scholar, a powerful strategic mind and a policy entrepreneur who led and guided the Nixon administration\u2019s foreign policy. Mr. Pompeo is a non-expert who sees his role as catering to Mr. Trump\u2019s whims and carrying out his ideas.\n\nMr. Trump most likely hopes that Mr. O\u2019Brien will prove to be not an irrepressible ideologue, a foreign-policy entrepreneur or a consensus-building process expert, but rather a functionary who will provide an official veneer for the president\u2019s often outlandish views and moves.\n\nThis would mean the continued decay of the council-led interagency process. Thus unimpeded by contrary voices, Mr. Trump could continue with his tactic of the attempted grand bargain \u2014 with China, North Korea, even Iran in certain circumstances that now seem remote \u2014 which in turn would be put into motion by blunt instruments like tariffs, initiatives announced by tweet and military bluster and threats.\n\nIf Mr. Trump were a strategic genius, that might be O.K. But Mr. Trump does not know precisely what strategic result he wants. In the case of Iran, he is intent on undermining the regime to an extent that Barack Obama did not. On North Korea, he harbors hazy visions of \u201cdenuclearization.\u201d While Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to stay out of military entanglements appears fairly durable and genuine, it is subject to his goal of subduing enemies by making deals, satisfying certain special partners (in particular, Israel and Saudi Arabia), and garrisoning America.\n\nIf he discovers he can\u2019t do these things, and believes that inability makes him less electable, he might just start a military conflict to rally his base and test the convention that voters will not turn against a president when the country is at war. Alternatively, he could double-down on border security, targeting unarmed enemies who can\u2019t shoot back.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon\u2019s caution functions as a constraint, it is a weaker inside bureaucratic player now that Jim Mattis is no longer defense secretary. The absence of a strong national security adviser and systematic decision making will make it easier for Mr. Trump to stumble into war, as he almost did with Iran last summer.\n\nMr. Trump, fronted by Mr. Pompeo, will probably continue to dangle \u201ctremendous deals\u201d and threaten bold military action to prop up his image as a simultaneous visionary and tough guy, neglecting what he considers mundane problems, such as humanitarian aid and refugee crises. Mr. O\u2019Brien will be along for an erratic and risky ride, probably relegated to the back seat. World affairs will continue to be unpredictable and in disarray, American policy incoherent, and the liberal rules-based order once led by the United States further degraded.\n\nJonathan Stevenson, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the managing editor of Survival, served on the National Security Council staff from 2011 to 2013.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
