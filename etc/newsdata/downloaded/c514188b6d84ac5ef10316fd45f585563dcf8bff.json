I've said in previous weeks we have to get more opportunities... create more,\" McTominay told the club's website here\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment with different opportunities we had and the way we started in the first 45 minutes because we were on the front foot and doing a lot of things right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s little mistakes we have to start cutting out... they cost you games and points. Everyone in the dressing room knows it is a tough one to take because we were on top.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s poor scoring form has not been helped by injuries to forwards Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial as well as the departure of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez to Inter Milan.\n\nHowever, McTominay backed United to overcome their problems.\n\n\u201cWe are Manchester United and everything is well documented but we have a real good bunch of players who are a tight-knit group and the team spirit is really good. We keep everything in house and it is all positive,\u201d he said.", "description": "Misfiring Manchester United must become more ruthless in front of goal to kickstart their Premier League campaign, midfielder Scott McTominay said after Monday's 1-1 draw against Arsenal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435771493&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901ZT", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
