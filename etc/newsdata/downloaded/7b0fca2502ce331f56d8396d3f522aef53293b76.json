That would be a big game changer if they didn't, or if they wanted them now.'\n\nAngie was first diagnosed with endometriosis, a condition where tissue lining the inside of the uterus grows outside of the uterus, in 2016.\n\n'It would have to be in the next five years': Angie said she is looking to start a family in the future, but noted that a game changer would be if her partner wanted to start trying for a family now\n\nAfter years of suffering crippling pain and long periods that would force her to stay in bed for days, she underwent a procedure to remove the endometriosis that same year.\n\nShe said that while babies aren't on the agenda in her immediate future, she wants to start addressing the symptoms now ahead of the next stage of her life.\n\n'I don't want to wait to get to the time when I want to have a baby because it could be a struggle.
