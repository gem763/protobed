Another source said he had heard that Whiteley was in talks with the Lions about hanging up his boots in favour of a coach\u2019s tracksuits.\n\nThe speculation is given credence by the fact that there is no exact prognosis on when his knee will be ready for him to play again, Whiteley assisting the Golden Lions\u2019 coaching staff during this year\u2019s Currie Cup, and his close relationship with the man most likely to replace De Bruin, Ivan \u201cCash\u201d van Rooyen.\n\nLions chief executive Rudolf Straeuli said Whiteley was \u201cstill in his rehabilitation phase\u201d and there were \u201cno decisions yet\u201d. The man himself, speaking at a rugby event last week, said his only focus was on getting over his niggling knee injury.\n\n\n\n\u201cObviously I coached in Currie Cup and I loved that and it\u2019s something that I definitely want to do after I stop playing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m still doing my rehab and physio and taking it slow. I saw a specialist and it\u2019s going to take a while, but obviously the plan would still be to play again.\n\nRead: Boks are missing Swys at World Cup, says Whiteley\n\n\u201cCoaching is something that I\u2019ll always develop in until I stop one day, but the big focus is getting my knee right.\u201d\n\nAsked if the talk doing the rounds about him stopping playing and taking up coaching sooner was not true, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult as I haven\u2019t got an answer yet on how long my knee can take, but my focus is my rehab and getting my knee right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging mentally, so I\u2019m taking it day by day and that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to answer your question but my focus is on getting it right.\u201d\n\nTo those still reeling at Lions coach Swys de Bruin\u2019s sudden departure from the Super Rugby franchise this week, don\u2019t be surprised if captain Warren Whiteley joins their coaching staff.\n\nWhiteley explained why his injury was so difficult to shake: \u201cI don\u2019t have cartilage so any time I walk or jog it\u2019s pretty much pressure straight on my bone. So I\u2019ve got bone bruising and I had that operation, and it has improved significantly from the operation.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s obviously going to take a bit of time \u2013 the specialist couldn\u2019t give me a time when I will be right again.\u201d\n\nAnother rugby insider explained that Whiteley turning to coaching could be attractive to the Lions by using the example of former Lions and Springbok tighthead prop Julian Redelinghuys, who turned to scrum coaching after etiring suddenly due to a neck injury.\n\nAccording to reports the union pays the player for the first six months of his injury, then medical insurance kicks in for the next year, meaning the Lions would effectively have Whiteley coaching for \u201cfree\u201d for most of his first year as coach.\n\nThat said, Van Rooyen could still prevail upon his friend \u2013 whose specialty as a coach has yet to be identified \u2013 to take pain injections and carry on as captain while he finds his feet as a Super Rugby head coach (Van Rooyen has only coached for two Currie Cup seasons from being a conditioning coach).", "description": "To those still reeling at Lions coach Swys de Bruin\u2019s sudden departure from the Super Rugby franchise this week, don\u2019t be surprised if captain Warren Whiteley joins their coaching staff.", "authors": ["Simnikiwe Xabanisa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2741/fdd2c22cc6814f52992cddea1fe6ce16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
