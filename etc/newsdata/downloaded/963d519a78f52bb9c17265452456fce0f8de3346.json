But in the 1970s, when overflowing animal shelters were euthanizing millions of homeless dogs annually, spaying and neutering puppies \u2014 procedures that involve removing ovaries or testicles \u2014 became the dogma in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nIt still is: Surveys indicate a large majority of pet dogs are fixed, and 31 states and the District require that pets adopted from shelters or rescues be sterilized. The surgeries simplify pet ownership by preventing females from going into heat and, some believe, by improving dog behavior, though experts say that is not clearly supported by research.\n\nBut the common wisdom has been complicated in recent years amid widening evidence connecting spaying and neutering to health problems in dogs. The findings are stronger for certain breeds and large dogs, and age of neutering plays a role. But the research is causing some owners and veterinarians to question the long-held tenet that fixing puppies \u2014 or fixing, period \u2014 is a necessary part of responsible pet ownership.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe owe it to our dogs to have a much larger conversation about spay and neuter,\u201d said Missy Simpson, a veterinary epidemiologist with the Morris Animal Foundation, a charity that funds animal health research. \u201cIt\u2019s nuanced, and there isn\u2019t a great one-size-fits-all recommendation for every dog.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSimpson was lead author of a recent paper on about 2,800 golden retrievers enrolled in a lifetime study, which found that those spayed or neutered were more likely to be overweight or obese. The study also found that dogs fixed before they were 6 months old had much higher rates of orthopedic injuries, and that keeping dogs lean didn\u2019t prevent those injuries.\n\nThe research has sparked controversy in the veterinary and shelter worlds, in part because widespread spaying and neutering are credited with helping fuel a dramatic decline in euthanasia. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which says about 670,000 dogs are killed in shelters each year, supports \u201cearly-age\u201d sterilization.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe question on a bigger level is to what extent are we sacrificing some bits of welfare for an individual animal for the welfare of the species?\u201d said Stephen L. Zawistowski, science adviser emeritus at the ASPCA. \u201cThe fact that we can actually have the conversation is a sign that we\u2019ve made such enormous progress.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2018It is complicated\u2019\n\nSpaying and neutering do have some clear health benefits for dogs. Testicular and ovarian cancers are moot, and there\u2019s evidence that spaying lowers the risk of mammary cancer and uterine infections. Fixed dogs also live longer on average.\n\nBut researchers say the reproductive hormones controlled by the removed sex organs have important systemic roles. They influence muscle mass and tendon and ligament strength, and they tell bones when to stop growing. \u201cWithout those hormones, your body might just not be as robust,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nAD\n\nThe recent debate over spaying and neutering flared in 2013, when a study from the University of California at Davis reported higher rates of hip dysplasia, cranial cruciate ligament tears and certain cancers among desexed golden retrievers \u2014 especially those neutered early, defined as before 1 year of age. The paper caused \u201cquite a bit of controversy\u201d among critics who \u201caccused us of, you know, driving overpopulation of animals,\u201d said author Benjamin Hart, a professor emeritus at Davis\u2019s vet school.\n\nAD\n\nHart and his colleagues later found higher rates of joint disorders, but not cancers, among Labrador retrievers and German shepherds that were neutered early. Their latest study, which is not yet published, examined 35 breeds and mutts and detected no associations between desexing and cancers or joint disorders in small dogs. But it found much greater rates of joint disorders among nearly all large dogs sterilized early, Hart said.\n\n\u201cDogs vary tremendously in their physiology, their anatomy. It\u2019s not surprising they would vary in these other things,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIt is complicated. That\u2019s why people need to talk it over with their veterinarian.\u201d\n\nThe American Veterinary Medical Association agrees, saying decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAD\n\nMichael Petty, a veterinarian in Canton, Mich., used to give the standard guidance: Spay or neuter at 6 months. But when he began seeing lots of ruptured cruciate ligaments among dogs neutered young, he wondered whether there was a connection. Based on research that has come out since, for the past decade or so, he has advised clients to hold off on sterilization until dogs reach puberty.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s easier to spay a puppy than an adult dog, Petty said. \u201cBut are we causing a problem down the road? We really have to say: First, do no harm.\u201d\n\nSpaying and neutering are much less common in Europe. Alexandra Horowitz, a dog cognition researcher at Barnard College, says in her new book, \u201cOur Dogs, Ourselves,\u201d that their widespread use here is an indictment of Americans\u2019 too-casual approach to pet ownership.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking dogs to take on the responsibility for our actions,\u201d Horowitz said in an interview \u2014 and, she added, for our squeamishness. \u201cOur culture is so caught up in the notion that our dogs shouldn\u2019t be sexual, and spay-neuter kind of feeds into that.\u201d\n\n\u2018Be realistic about it\u2019\n\nOwning intact dogs can be less convenient. Females bleed when in heat, and males are more prone to urine-marking.\n\nAD\n\nRobson, the owner of Rumble and Astro, said her dogs don\u2019t do that. Her first five dogs were rescues, and all were fixed before she took them in. But when she purchased Astro, his breeder had a condition: Don\u2019t neuter until he\u2019s 2. By then, Astro\u2019s vet \u2014 citing research on neutered golden retrievers and cancer \u2014 suggested that she leave him intact.\n\nAD\n\nAstro is \u201cso mellow,\u201d Robson said, that she agreed. It helps that they live on a lot of land in the Denver foothills, far from other dogs.\n\n\u201cAs an owner, you have to be comfortable with your ability to supervise them and to make sure they\u2019re not going to run off and do something stupid and get caught with a girl,\u201d said Robson, whose younger dog, Rumble, is enrolled in the golden retriever lifetime study.\n\nSherri Wilson, an accountant in Grand Junction, Colo., had a similar experience. The breeder of her 5-year-old golden retriever, Bailey, asked that she wait until he was 18 months old to neuter him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe got to 18 months, and it was like, why would we do it? He had no behavior problems, no aggression,\u201d she said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t see a reason to do it, and we could see several reasons not to do it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeople active in dog sports pay close attention to research on joint problems, and many now choose not to spay or neuter, said Wendy Garvin, a dog trainer in Riverton, Utah. Her five intact pooches do agility, dock-diving and other sports.\n\nFour years ago, Garvin started a Facebook group that offers advice on managing dogs that aren\u2019t spayed or neutered. Owners need to know how to keep males and females apart when necessary, she said, and how to recognize when females are coming into heat (in her house, she said, it\u2019s when \u201cthe boys get stupid,\u201d doing things like licking the females\u2019 privates and humping).\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are people who would love to sell you a bundle of roses with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI would rather be realistic about it.\u201d\n\nGarvin said the Facebook group grows by about 20 to 30 people each month, many ordinary pet owners. In some cases, she recommends that they opt for vasectomies or hysterectomies for their dogs \u2014 procedures that prevent reproduction but spare hormones. A small but growing number of veterinarians perform them.\n\n\u201cPeople are pretty capable if they take ownership of their responsibility,\u201d she said. But, she added, \u201cnone of us want to see more unwanted puppies.\u201d", "description": "Fixing dogs has been dogma for decades.
