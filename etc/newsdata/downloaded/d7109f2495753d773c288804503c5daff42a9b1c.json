Last week, a Cambodian court charged three men with gang-raping a French tourist in the coastal province of Kampot after offering her a ride in their car.\n\nIn 2013, Kampot town was rocked by the discovery of a mutilated body of a 25-year-old Frenchwoman floating in a river.\n\nA Belgian was charged with the alleged rape and murder of the woman, but released on bail due to a lack of evidence.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Cambodia deployed soldiers, police and divers to scour an island popular with backpackers after a British tourist went missing there four days ago, an official told AFP on Monday.
