No problem with me,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nTrump has stepped up sanctions against Iran since he withdrew from a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers, saying the agreement left open a path for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons and did not address what the United States calls Iran\u2019s malign activities in the region.\n\nRouhani has said Iran, which denies seeking nuclear weapons, would not talk to the United States until Washington lifted the sanctions it has reimposed on Tehran after pulling out of the nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cIran should straighten out because frankly they are in a very bad position right now,\u201d Trump said.\n\nLast week Trump said a meeting with Rouhani was possible at the U.N.
