We haven\u2019t seen such pathetic, eager submission to the forces of evil since the last time some Bulwark scribbler got a chance to be on a CNN panel about Trump with Ana Navarro and a cross-dressing furry.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the rich schmucks who own the basketball teams. It\u2019s our entire elite, the whole useless lot of them, who can\u2019t wait to bow down to the Pinko Peril. You just sprinkle a few bucks around DC and NY and the whole sorry lot of those who presume to be our betters start chanting, \u201cThank you, comrade, may I have another.\u201d\n\nQatar did the same thing, buying our For Sale betters, except on a smaller scale and with less pork. And now the elite is outraged because Trump sees the scam and can\u2019t be bought \u2013 to them, he\u2019s the worst of both worlds.\n\nThis latest craven capitulation to foreign potentates by our loser leaders just reaffirms what those of us who are conservawoke know \u2013 that our elitists are not for us. They are for themselves, and that means they are for their overseas paymasters. They are for China, not only for that sweet, sweet commie cash, but because the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s stranglehold on the Chinese people provides them with a template for doing the same thing to us. Think of it \u2013 a country without accountability or restraint upon the anointed few. Wait a minute, that sounds like Washington, D.C. today \u2013 at least if you\u2019re a Democrat.\n\nIt\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9 about how New York Times hacks gush over how lucky the Chinese rulers are not to have to worry about things like the consent of the governed. It sure is easy to do the things you and your pals want done \u2013 but the people don\u2019t want done \u2013 when the people don\u2019t get a say. That\u2019s our elite\u2019s not-so-secret fantasy \u2013 to be able to impose whatever nonsense they desire upon us without us being able to object. Whether it\u2019s converting us at straw-point to their weird climate religion, wiping out our history and culture, or simply covering up the corruption of its own \u2013 like Hairplug One\u2019s yayo-yiffing, zipper-dropping son \u2013 the total control exercised by its efficient rulers makes China their role model.\n\nWell, maybe not the efficiency part. Like we could trust our dingus nomenklatura to make the trains run on time. They\u2019d screw up the train schedule, then announce that it\u2019s no biggie because trains must be banned anyway because of global warming.\n\nThis explains why they can\u2019t say enough good things about China, and why they desperately seek to stop us from saying bad things about China. Our crony capitalists are only too eager to help, conspiring with these communist bastards to trample the freedom of people in China and Hong Kong today, and you tomorrow. Paranoid? What have you seen in the last five years that gives you any confidence at all that any major American company wouldn\u2019t sell out your liberty for a 1% bump to their bottom line?\n\nThe NBA is just the latest willing serfcorp to go crawling to their Eastern masters. The tech overlords have been helping the Chinese police state do its thought policing for years. What do you want to bet that cheap Chinese crap you buy at Walmart is made by Uighur with a chain around his ankle? And Hollywood? The creative types used to fume when they got notes from smarmy suits in LA. Now they\u2019re delighted to follow the commands of the Ministry of Proper Thoughts in Beijing.\n\nIt\u2019s not a question of whether our elite can be bought. They can. Like the man said, we have established what they are. The only question is the price. If you want Chinese money, you gotta play ball. If you want the freedom, too bad. You can\u2019t have both.\n\nA bit of personal corruption is bad, but this corruption is designed to undermine our country over the long run. Right now, the Chinese are ripping off our tech, building up their military, and normalizing controlled speech. All the while the people supposed to be keeping us safe are howling at Trump for pointing out the manifest corruption of swamp-son Grandmaster Cash Biden.\n\nOur elites are not even asleep on the job. If they were asleep, at least they wouldn\u2019t be doing any damage. No, they are active participants in the undermining of our freedom and sovereignty, and it has got to stop. At least Donald Trump\u2019s trying \u2013 which only makes them hate him (and you, for electing him) even more.\n\nWhat can we do? Keep supporting the Trump trade policies and our military rebuild. But we need to do more. Let\u2019s hit the weak-heart companies in the pocketbook. Let\u2019s get our Congress, to the extent it isn\u2019t already bought and paid for with Beijing\u2019s bucks, to take a break from the Impeachapalooza to pass a law giving foreigners the right to go into US courts and sue any American company that assists a foreign government anywhere in violating any right found in our First Amendment. Yeah, let\u2019s use lawyers for good instead of evil. Let\u2019s let people who are spied on, arrested, or locked in prison sue in an American court. \u201cBut but but that will cost us zillions!\u201d the corporate collaborators will cry. Yeah, it will. You can tick off the ChiComs, or you can tick off us \u2013 don\u2019t choose poorly, jerks.\n\nThis can\u2019t go on, not if we wish to remain free \u2013 and we wish it. China is wiping the floor with us, and our elite is happily operating the mop and bucket.\n\nWhat happens if our garbage ruling caste manages to get unchallenged control? Well, you can be sure that pack of over-credentialed mediocrities won\u2019t pull off their little Reich as well as the Chinese have. Check out my action-packed yet hilarious novels of America torn apart by the kind of liberal fascism the Democrats promise, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire (plus Book Number IV comes out this November)! They are banned in China and by the cruise-shilling hacks of Conservative, Inc.!
