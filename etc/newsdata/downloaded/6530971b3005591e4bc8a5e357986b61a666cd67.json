Bush and Barack Obama, and he has discussed his policy differences with each of them. But he has taken particular care to avoid any criticism of President Donald Trump in his writing and during interviews.\n\nMattis said Tuesday during a Q&A session with Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass that he would speak out about the current administration \u201cwhen the time\u2019s right.\u201d He offered no indication as to when he would break his silence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that if you leave an administration over a matter of policy ... that you then get out and start talking in what we commonly call a kiss-and-tell now,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nMattis stepped down from his post as defense secretary last year with a resignation letter that appeared to scrutinize Trump\u2019s military judgment and imply that the president did not take seriously the threat of authoritarianism in Russia and China.", "description": "The former defense secretary said he didn't know the former vice president would launch a bid for the White House.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7570cd240000122777c74d.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
