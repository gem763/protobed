It does not, however, affect humans.\n\nThe Philippines, the world\u2019s seventh-biggest pork importer, has further tightened its animal quarantine rules to protect its $5 billion hog industry, after declaring its first outbreak on Sept. 9 and reporting several more cases since.\n\nThe infections, which are contained so far on the northern island of Luzon, have prompted the culling of more than 30,000 pigs so far in virus-hit areas.\n\nTo protect their industries, several provinces in central and southern Philippines have imposed a ban on pork and pork-based products from Metropolitan Manila and other virus-hit provinces.", "description": "The highly contagious and deadly African swine fever virus has spread to two more provinces in the Philippines, the world's 10th-largest pork consumer, officials said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
