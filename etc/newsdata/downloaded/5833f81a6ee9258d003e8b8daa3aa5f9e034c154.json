Dejan (Lovren) misjudged it, thinks he can let it bounce and Son is away and Ali made a really special save.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t touch the ball but he was so big in that moment he made life really difficult for Son.\u201d\n\nAn early goal from Harry Kane had put the visitors in front, after Son's deflected shot had hit the post via Lovren, before his teammate headed in the rebound.\n\nLiverpool peppered the Spurs goalmouth, and eventually got their reward not long after Son's squandered opportunity.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFabinho picked out Jordan Henderson with a ball into the box - despite the best efforts of Danny Rose to stop its progress - before the Reds captain struck a half-volley into the far corner.\n\nThe onslaught continued into the Kop end as Liverpool went in search of a winner, and were handed the chance when Serge Aurier clumsily brought down Sadio Mane in the box.\n\nReferee Anthony Taylor had no hesitation in pointing to the spot, allowing Mohamed Salah to step up and fire home the winner.\n\nLiverpool restored their six-point lead over rivals Man City, but Klopp was keen to play down any early title talk.\n\n\u201cWe now have 28 points, but you only have to think what would have happened if we lost today, what the questions would have been,\" Klopp added.\n\n\u201cWe know exactly what we have to do. We have to focus on all the games, next one Arsenal , then Aston Villa, then Genk, then Manchester City . There is a lot to come but so far, so good.\u201d", "description": "The goalkeeper made just his fourth appearance of the season against Tottenham and was involved in a crucial moment", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741336.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KRC-Genk-v-Liverpool-FC-Group-E-UEFA-Champions-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
