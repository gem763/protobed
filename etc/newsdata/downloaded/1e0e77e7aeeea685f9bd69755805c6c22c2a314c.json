(Susan Walsh/AP Photo)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 One minute, Washington Capitals forward Tom Wilson was calm. The next, he was not. And, the 25-year-old suggested, he wasn\u2019t riled up over something an opposing player had said during the Capitals\u2019 4-3 preseason finale win over the Carolina Hurricanes on Sunday at PNC Arena. He was upset by a coach.\n\nLate in the second period, Wilson was assessed two minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct and a 10-minute misconduct penalty after he exchanged words with Hurricanes defenseman Joel Edmundson near the Carolina bench. But what turned from a small back-and-forth quickly escalated, and Wilson had to be held back by a referee, who skated him toward the tunnel across the ice.\n\nWilson was seen yelling at the Carolina bench as he was being skated away. After the game, he insinuated he was upset over something a Carolina coach had said from the bench.\n\n[Capitals finish preseason with a win, but roster questions remain ahead of opening night]\n\n\u201cI was pretty calm until some words came from their bench and it wasn\u2019t the players so we\u2019ll leave it at that,\u201d Wilson said, without naming the coach who was involved. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly an emotional guy, but I don\u2019t think, you ask anyone around the league, coaches chirping players is appropriate.\u201d\n\nTom Wilson gets a misconduct for wanting to fight the entire Carolina Hurricanes bench pic.twitter.com/1OfVGA9beG \u2014 Ian Oland (@ianoland) September 29, 2019\n\nCapitals Coach Todd Reirden also did not mince words when talking about the interaction, saying he \u201cstrongly, strongly\u201d disagrees with any coach talking to a player from an opposing team.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get a chance to play anymore when you are a coach so you shouldn\u2019t be talking to someone who is playing and to me, that is off-limits and that is something I have always believed as a player, as a coach,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cNo coaches should be yelling at players on other teams because you have no chance to go out and do anything about it and hockey is a special game and in respect to the battle and the compete and enthusiasm and all the passion that is out there, but it is for the players and when the coaches get involved, to me that is wrong.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nMichal Kempny doubtful for Capitals\u2019 season opener at Blues because of hamstring injury\n\nDmitry Orlov is waiting for his partner on the Capitals\u2019 blue line to be determined\n\nFor Chandler Stephenson, the stakes are high in preseason\u2019s final week\n\nThe future might be arriving fast for Capitals goalie Ilya Samsonov", "description": "\u201cI was pretty calm until some words came from their bench and it wasn\u2019t the players so we\u2019ll leave it at that,\" Wilson said.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports", "September At Pm", "Samantha Pell Covers High School Sports For The Washington Post.
