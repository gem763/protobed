She really is thinking about it.\n\nNormally you could dismiss a tease like this one on grounds that the would-be candidate who\u2019s teasing it is just trying to stay relevant. There\u2019s no publicity like \u201cmight run for president\u201d publicity, right? Clinton doesn\u2019t need to head-fake about jumping in to get the media to cover her, though. Every time she dings Trump on Twitter or elsewhere it\u2019s amplified endlessly by the press. Tulsi Gabbard is now running as the anti-Hillary in the field thanks to one 20-second comment Clinton made about her recently in an interview. Any \u201cshe might run\u201d publicity has a short shelf life, too: We\u2019re only about three months removed from the Iowa caucuses. No one will believe that Hillary might still be getting in the race if she hasn\u2019t entered by, say, Thanksgiving. The idea that she\u2019s doing this for PR just doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nI think she\u2019s looking for excuses to get in but just hasn\u2019t gotten the clarity she needs from the polls to justify doing so. This new one from Quinnipiac is the most enticing for her to come along in awhile considering it\u2019s the worst number Biden has pulled in a national survey since August:\n\nNote the numbers among women especially. Warren, the lone woman left among the plausible nominees, hasn\u2019t even won a third of Democratic women voters (yet). Biden is down to 20 percent among them. There\u2019s a lot of room potentially there for Hillary. And of course Clinton has always done well with black voters, her firewall against Bernie Sanders in 2016. Would it be unrealistic to expect her to immediately attract, say, a third of all Democratic women and a third of all black Democrats instantly if she were to jump in?\n\nBecause if that did happen, she\u2019d be right in the thick of the race on day one.\n\nThere are problems, though. For starters, this Quinnipiac survey is unusual in showing Biden fading behind Warren, theoretically creating demand for a new centrist-y candidate to get in. Yesterday CNN published a poll showing him leading the field with 34 percent, fully 15 percent ahead of Warren. Two other polls recently had him at 30 percent or better while others have had him steady at 27 percent, still a respectable number in a field this big. That is, the evidence that Biden is beginning to stagger as Warren supposedly rises inexorably just isn\u2019t there \u2014 yet. And given the sort of time window Clinton is looking at to get in, if it doesn\u2019t arrive very soon it\u2019ll be too late.\n\nThe other problem is that it\u2019s possible Hillary would have her best day of polling on the day she announced and would begin to sink shortly afterward. All of her vulnerabilities would be publicized by the other candidates. Some Biden fans would resent her for trying to snatch away his chance at the nomination. Progressives would recoil at her attempt to derail the party\u2019s journey towards socialism. Even her fans would be given pause by the inconvenient fact that she already lost once before to the guy they\u2019re spoiling to beat next year.\n\nBut there\u2019s this scenario too: She gets in and Biden starts to fade as neoliberals conclude, reluctantly, that he\u2019s \u201clost a step\u201d and therefore Clinton\u2019s the only game in town. The progressive vote remains split between Bernie and Warren, enabling a surprise Clinton win in Iowa. Or, even if it consolidates behind one of them, enough moderate Democrats end up being spooked by the idea that Sanders and Warren are too radical to beat Trump that they grudgingly swing around to Hillary as the least bad (but still bad) option. There are ways to rationalize the belief that she\u2019d do better against Trump than she did in 2016, too. Her advisor gives you one in the clip below: Trump\u2019s not running as a populist outsider anymore but as an incumbent with a record he\u2019ll need to defend. He\u2019s all but certain to have \u201cimpeached\u201d on his resume by the time Election Day arrives. Meanwhile, Hillary\u2019s own chief scandal from 2016, Emailgate, is old news by now. And plenty of Hillary fans will tell you that she only lost to Trump because of Russian meddling. With America less likely to get caught sleeping on the threat of foreign interference next year, that\u2019s less of a worry in 2020. Add all of that up and toss in the fact that Hillary 2020 would surely spend lots more time in the Rust Belt than Hillary 2016 did and is it *possible* that she could win?\n\nSure, it\u2019s possible. You\u2019ll never convince me that she\u2019d have the best chance of winning among the Democratic field; a rando like Amy Klobuchar or even Joe Biden in doddering form would be a much safer gamble. But yeah, conceivably she could win. She won the popular vote once before, after all.\n\nShe\u2019s not running, though. I think the \u201cHillary might run again\u201d rumors are nothing more or less than the Clintons clinging to the *theoretical* possibility that their time hasn\u2019t quite passed yet. It\u2019s hard to begrudge a retired player the fantasy that there\u2019s still a chance for them to suit up, take the field, and finally win the Super Bowl.
