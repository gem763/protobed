Some nights the youngest one gets there first. In the silence that follows the sharp chirp of deactivation, I can hear him trudging back up the stairs, while I\u2019m still trying to find my glasses in the dark.\n\n\u201c4.30am,\u201d I say, looking at my phone.\n\n\u201cI called them again,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got back to me.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the burglar alarm has become just another noise to adapt to, like the smoke alarm that lets the whole house know someone is making toast. The possibility of fire no longer occurs to me.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, my wife pulls open the door of my office shed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming on Tuesday,\u201d she says. \u201cAre you in, in case I\u2019m out?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe alarm people?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cNo, the oven people,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from the alarm people.\u201d\n\n\u201cOven people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve ordered a new oven,\u201d she says.\n\nI blame myself. During a recent conversation with an oven repairman, I asked about ovens that didn\u2019t break all the time or require the constant replacement of expensive spare parts. He recommended a model of catering oven, and I became taken with the idea of owning something utilitarian and sturdy, an appliance that would lend my kitchen the businesslike air of commercial premises. Then I found out catering ovens cost \u00a33,000.\n\nThat put an end to the matter as far as I was concerned, but my wife quietly opened a separate line of inquiry into reliable domestic ovens.\n\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d she says.\n\nOn Saturday, my wife stops me on my way up the stairs.\n\n\u201cAre you here on Thursday for the alarm man?\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here on any day for the alarm man,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cI just think we might need a lesson in how it works,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHe can come at four in the morning, if he wants,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m up anyway.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon my wife asks me to step into the kitchen. There are two men standing there, hands in pockets, with the old oven halfway out of its slot.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying they won\u2019t install it,\u201d my wife says. \u201cBecause the worktop is wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the worktop, it\u2019s the splashback,\u201d says one of the men, referring to what I believe is more accurately known as the upstand: a three-inch wooden skirt running where the worktop meets the wall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s regulations,\u201d the other man says. \u201cFor fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cFix it,\u201d my wife says.\n\n\u201cWhat, in front of everyone?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d she says. \u201cBefore they take the oven away!\u201d\n\nThe upstand behind the oven is glued to the wall, and comes away with a crack after I attack it with a hammer and chisel. But the adjacent sections are screwed to the worktop, and cannot be worked loose.\n\nTim Dowling: how long does it take to be broken by a 4.50am alarm? Read more\n\n\u201cHow much of it has to go?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201c70 mil, either side,\u201d says the man.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just saw off two chunks?\u201d my wife says.\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t that look weird?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cYou will care,\u201d I say. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t have the right saw.\u201d\n\nOnly after the men leave do I have a bright idea: removing the worktop altogether by unscrewing it from beneath. It takes five minutes.\n\n\u201cToo bad I didn\u2019t think of this sooner,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t redeliver until Saturday,\u201d my wife says. The smoke alarm goes off.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s having toast?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d says the youngest one, appearing.\n\n\u201cWhy are you having toast now?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m hungry,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy are you taking the kitchen apart?\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the alarm man arrives and replaces a spent battery, solving the problem. Then he demonstrates how to engage the alarm in a way that stops the cat setting it off.\n\n\u201cFour-digit code,\u201d he says, pointing to the box. \u201cThen C for cat, then yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cCode, C for cat, yes,\u201d I repeat solemnly.
