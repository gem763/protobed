His foot was sore when he arrived at Yankee Stadium before Tuesday\u2019s game .\n\nA four-time All-Star, Betances is a 31-year-old right-hander eligible for free agency after the World Series. Boone spoke with New York on the brink of clinching the AL East title.\n\nBetances was diagnosed with an impingement in his pitching shoulder after his fourth spring training appearance on March 17. His rehabilitation stopped when the team said June 11 that he had strained his right latissimus dorsi muscle, and Betances did not start a minor league injury rehabilitation assignment until September.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yankees reliever Dellin Betances has been told surgery is not recommended for the partially torn Achilles tendon that ended his season after eight pitches.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/yankees_betances_baseball_11062_c0-317-3973-2633_s1770x1032.jpg?8d500bf3f0f48da076ad10d2f38ddd20da4348a7", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
