After the backlash, U.S. senator Tim Kaine said he opposed Tran\u2019s bill, and one of the Democrats who voted for it in committee said he probably would vote against it if it came up again. But most Democrats stayed silent. After Republican candidate Kelly McGinn hit delegate Danica Roem, a Democrat and the first transgender member of the Virginia legislature, for supporting the abortion bill, Roem finally publicly opposed the bill this month.\n\nBut even if Democrats have obscured the radical nature of their abortion agenda, Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, warns that an extreme agenda is exactly what Democrats will implement if they gain complete control of Virginia\u2019s government for the first time in nearly three decades.\n\n\u201cThere are no more pro-life Democrats in Virginia,\u201d says Turner. \u201cCurrently there are no sitting members of the general assembly on the Democratic side who oppose taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d Virginia, like most states, prohibits state tax dollars from being used to fund elective abortions for Medicaid recipients. Among the states that do fund Medicaid abortions, only seven have done so voluntarily, while the other ten are under court mandates to do so. Providing taxpayer funding of abortion for Medicaid recipients has a dramatic effect in increasing the abortion rate.\n\n\u201cIf they get full control, it is their avowed intention \u2014 and they said as much during the general assembly \u2014 to pass a radical agenda that mirrors the one that passed in New York, stripping out all of Virginia\u2019s . . . reasonable pro-life laws,\u201d says Turner. \u201cKathy Tran\u2019s bill was not the only bill introduced to achieve that agenda last year. There were actually eight bills.\u201d\n\nOne would end Virginia\u2019s 24-hour waiting period for abortion. Another bill would declare abortion a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d After that bill and a Senate bill identical to Kathy Tran\u2019s bill failed to advance in committee, Democratic governor Ralph Northam said, \u201cWhen we can\u2019t change people\u2019s minds, we change seats.\u201d", "description": "The November 5 legislative elections in Virginia aren\u2019t getting much attention, and many voters may not realize it could have disastrous consequences.", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
