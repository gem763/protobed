Not just yours. The feelings of your co-workers, your boss, your clients and customers, too.\n\nListening, communicating, people skills, empathy and emotional intelligence will soon become more important job skills than \u201cthinking tasks\u201d like analysis, according to professors at the University of Maryland and National Taiwan University.\n\nWith artificial intelligence and automation increasingly handling data dives and calculations in all sorts of professions, today\u2019s \u201cthinking economy\u201d is fast transforming into the \u201cfeeling economy,\u201d they determined in a study published in California Management Review, a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nBy 2036, most professions will put more importance on \u2018feeling tasks\u2019 like building work relationships and coordinating with colleagues.\n\nFor example, biochemists and biophysicists in 2006 needed few feeling skills, with those duties accounting for almost 8% of the job. By 2016, that accounted for 25.5% of the job because the scientists were expected to train and teach others, the study noted.\n\nBy 2036, most professions will put more importance on \u201cfeeling tasks\u201d like building work relationships and coordinating with colleagues, than \u201cthinking tasks\u201d like processing or data evaluation, the study said.\n\nThere\u2019s already been a 5.1% increase in the importance of \u201cfeeling tasks\u201d from 2006 to 2016, the researchers said, based on a review of job descriptions issued by the U.S. Department of Labor. During the same time, there was a 0.5% rise in demand for \u201cthinking tasks.\u201d\n\nOf course, businesses have long needed people who can read a room to close a sale and managers who know how to motivate workers. But those skills can\u2019t be easily performed by AI,\u201d said Roland Rust, a University of Maryland marketing professor and one of the study\u2019s authors.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: People spend most of their waking hours staring at screens\n\nThese tasks are taking on \u201cunprecedented importance,\u201d Rust added. So where does this leave the shy worker, or the person who blanches at the idea of networking? Feel assured there are ways to succeed in the evolving economy, experts say.\n\nRust now speaks at academic conferences, but the self-described introvert used to stammer on group phone calls and panic at the idea of public speaking. He started meditating in his undergraduate days, which helped. Rust also practiced public speaking and engaging with people.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s training. It just requires a different education than we are used to,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts on emotional intelligence and the workplace told MarketWatch about the ways people can sharpen their skills in the rising \u201cfeeling economy.\u201d\n\nStart with the basics\n\nRight now, many Americans lack the vocabulary to describe how they\u2019re actually feeling, said Marc Brackett, founder and director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of the book, \u201cPermission to Feel.\u201d\n\n\u2018We become clumpers. I\u2019m stressed, I\u2019m happy and there\u2019s nothing in between.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe become clumpers. I\u2019m stressed, I\u2019m happy and there\u2019s nothing in between,\u201d he said. But our emotions are much more specific, he said, such as feeling disappointment for an unmet expectation or anger for a perceived injustice.\n\nBuilding that vocabulary is an early step. Another part is applying that vocabulary in real life, in what Brackett calls a \u201cmeta-moment\u201d to handle the tough times in the office or elsewhere.\n\nIt starts with acknowledging how you feel and then pausing and breathing. Then it\u2019s a matter of \u201cactivating your best self,\u201d the person you aspire to be, and then thinking what are the next steps that \u201cbest self\u201d would take.\n\nUnderstanding and managing emotions takes work. \u201cIt\u2019s effortful, it needs practice and refinement and people don\u2019t want to do the work,\u201d Brackett said.\n\nPut. Down. The. Phone.\n\nHuman connections like eye contact or being present in a room are key to building relationships, said Mark Fenner, a Dallas, Texas based business strategist helping small and mid-sized health-care and technology companies.\n\nBut cell phones might be a distraction from forging those connections. Furthermore, too many people can use social media just to talk past each other and reinforce views they want to believe, said Fenner. One problem: \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken the time to think, \u2018who is this person I\u2019m communicating with?\u2019\u201d\n\nFinding the time to really focus on colleagues and workers will pay dividends, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be more open to connecting, and connecting is the gateway to influence,\u201d Fenner said. \u201cYou can have greatest idea in world, but if you can\u2019t get other people to act on those ideas, then the worth of those idea is zero. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\nFind a mentor to check yourself\n\nSome people might need a trusted second opinion to get an outside look at how well they communicate or handle a disagreement. A \u201cprofessional mentor will give you a gauge,\u201d said Paul McDonald, senior executive director at the global staffing company Robert Half International RHI, -2.35%.\n\n\u201cA mentor can check to see if you are really in touch with your feelings\u201d and whether \u201cyou are able to bridge the difference between yourself and others,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cEmotional Intelligence is what we are talking about, and employers very much value individuals who are in touch with who they are.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Feeling tasks\u2019 like listening and working together will soon be more important for most jobs, a new study finds.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS898_AI_off_ZG_20191008163156.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
