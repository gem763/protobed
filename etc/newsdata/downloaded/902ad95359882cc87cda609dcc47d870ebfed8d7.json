(Photo: Mark Wilson / Getty)\n\nHouse lawmakers probing Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon for potential antitrust violations have requested the companies turn over internal records, including executives\u2019 own communications.\n\nA barrage of letters signed by Republicans and Democrats on Friday said the requests are part of an ongoing investigation by the House of Representative's Judiciary Committee into whether the companies are involved in anti-competitive behaviour. The investigation, which began in June, also aims to assess whether current laws are adequate enough to ensure competition in online markets.\n\nThe requests were tailored for each company, with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, for example, being asked to turn over records specific to the company\u2019s online book sales and other products, including its facial recognition software, Rekognition.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether lawmakers intend to call the companies to appear before the committee, but the records requested are typical of those used to inform such hearings.\n\nNone of the companies immediately responded to Gizmodo\u2019s requests for comment.\n\n\u201cThe open Internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\u201d Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the committee\u2019s chairman, said in a statement. \u201cBut there is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications,\u201d\n\nHis Republican counterpart, Rep. Doug Collins, said that hearings on the issue of competitiveness would be ongoing, but that additional fact-finding was presently needed. \u201cThis information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behaviour is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on the questions, it\u2019s clear lawmakers are digging into specific areas of the companies\u2019 businesses, such as Facebook and Google\u2019s online advertising dominance. Questions to Facebook also centered on various acquisitions, including WhatsApp and Instagram, and what CEO Mark Zuckerberg may have said about those companies when they still competed with Facebook.\n\nA selection of questions sent by members of the House Judiciary Committee to Apple CEO Tim Cook\n\nApple, meanwhile, is being questioned over a myriad of products and services, including the iPhone, Apple Maps and iCloud, as well as how the company ranks and imposes restrictions on apps in the App Store.\n\nThe House investigation\u2019s progress comes amid a ballooning number of antitrust probes into America\u2019s largest companies. On Monday, 50 attorneys general, including those from 48 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, launched an antitrust probe into Google, which recently confirmed it\u2019s also under investigation by the Justice Department.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is currently looking into anti-competitive practices by Facebook, which also faces a state-level investigation, and the FTC has reportedly set its regulatory sights on Amazon as well.", "description": "House lawmakers probing Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon for potential antitrust violations have requested the companies turn over internal records, including executives\u2019 own communications....", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Catie Keck"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/dzxwkcirgi2k0hustfza.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
