Here's everything you need to know about the latest episode in this political soap opera.\n\nWhy does Boris Johnson want to suspend Parliament?\n\nJohnson announced his intention to prorogue Parliament at the end of August. The move will take effect at the close on business on Monday, and Parliament won't open again until October 14.\n\nFor most of the five-week period, Parliament may not have been sitting anyway -- it was due to rise at the end of this week for party conference season, returning in the second week of October. So Johnson's prorogation has only added a handful of days to the length of time MPs are away.\n\nThe Prime Minister said the suspension was needed to make way for a new Queen's Speech -- the way in which a new session of Parliament begins. Normally, a Queen's Speech takes place every year, and Parliament is always prorogued before it is reopened by the monarch.\n\nPrevious PM Theresa May allowed the current parliamentary session to run on far longer than normal, given the protracted nature of the Brexit crisis.\n\nThere's no set time period for a prorogation before a Queen's Speech -- in 2016 it was just four working days, while in 2014 the chamber was closed for 13 days.\n\nSo why is this suspension controversial?\n\nJohnson's opponents have claimed he is shutting down Parliament to stifle debate, and to allow the clock to run down on Brexit.\n\nIn an extraordinary intervention, the Speaker of the House John Bercow -- whose role is traditionally impartial -- said it was \"blindly obvious\" Johnson was attempting to limit debate over Brexit with the move.\n\n\"Shutting down Parliament would be an offense against the democratic process and the rights of Parliamentarians as the people's elected representatives,\" Bercow said in a statement.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly insisted he will allow Britain to exit the EU with no deal on October 31 -- but the majority of lawmakers are opposed to that idea, and have been working to block it.\n\nA handful of legal attempts to overturn the prorogation have failed, allowing it to take place as planned.\n\nI thought Johnson wanted an election?\n\nHe does. His hands are tied by a Parliament set against no-deal Brexit, and now he doesn't even have a majority in the House of Commons. Last week, Johnson expelled 21 lawmakers from his Conservative Party after they defied him on a bill to block a no-deal Brexit, leaving him with no room for maneuver in Parliament.\n\nThe problem for Johnson is that to call an early election a Prime Minister needs two-thirds of MPs to vote in favor of it -- and he can't get close to that.\n\nThat's because Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has spent two years demanding an election, is leading an united effort of opposition MPs to vote it down.\n\nCorbyn is insisting that Britain should only go to the polls once a no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table.\n\nThat puts Johnson in a tough spot -- some opinion polls suggest he would win an early election, but if he can't get one before November he will be forced to ask Brussels for another Brexit extension, by a bill that passed Parliament last week and achieved royal assent on Monday.\n\nWhat is a no-deal Brexit?\n\nIf the UK reaches the October 31 deadline without having a withdrawal agreement in place, the legal default is that it will just leave the EU without one.\n\nIn an instant, the country would lose its access to the EU's single market and customs union, which facilitate trade between the bloc's members. All manner of legal arrangements agreed by EU bodies will no longer apply in the UK, and businesses, public bodies and citizens would have to deal with the changes that leaving the EU would bring.\n\nIt's the outcome that May, the country's opposition parties, and a majority of lawmakers in Parliament have been working for three years to avoid, and is shrouded in warnings from economists and business leaders.\n\nBut some Conservative MPs have been arguing in favor of a no-deal Brexit, on the basis that it would increase Britain's freedom to manage its own trade deals, laws and border arrangements, and end the current period of political uncertainty.\n\nUnfortunately for Johnson, he's been forced to ask for a Brexit delay in October if no-deal is the only other option.\n\nExpect that to lead to a showdown, with Johnson potentially scrambling for a way to defy the law and maintain his repeated insistence that, on October 31, Britain will exit the bloc with or without a deal.\n\nWhat happens after Monday night's suspension?\n\nThe pause button will be pressed on parliamentary efforts to ensure Britain won't leave the EU without a deal, and MPs will head to their respective party's conferences -- which are sure to be dominated by Brexit.\n\nThey'll return in mid-October to hear the new Queen's Speech, and will then hold a vote on its contents -- essentially a litmus test for any government to see whether they command the majority of lawmakers.\n\nJohnson could well lose that vote, and that would give Labour's Corbyn an opportunity to form an alternative government without the need for an election. But that also looks unlikely -- while most lawmakers are against no-deal, that doesn't mean they support the leftist Corbyn, whose Labour Party has fewer seats than the Conservatives.\n\nIn other words, a frantic dash to form a government in late October is possible -- with just days or even hours to go until Britain's Brexit deadline.\n\nDoes a suspended Parliament make no-deal Brexit more likely?\n\nIt's unclear -- in theory, no-deal is off the table on October 31 because of the new legislation.\n\nBut Johnson isn't backing down from bullish rhetoric about leaving on that date -- so something is going to have to give.\n\nIf the Prime Minister finds a way around the law, there will be very little time in late October for lawmakers to pass another one.\n\nDon't rule anything out before then, however. The Brexit saga will undoubtedly take more twists and turns in the coming weeks.", "description": "Britain's Brexit saga enters a new phase on Monday, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prorogues -- or suspends -- Parliament for over a month.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190903150422-uk-flag-parliament-2-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
