It\u2019s important to note the dramatizations made in Sonni\u2019s declaration are a one-sided account made with a specific goal in mind.\u2019\n\nThe pair \u2013 who split in 2014, just months after tying the knot \u2013 share the six-year-old together, but have been disputing who will be her primary carer.\n\nSonni had filed for sole custody last month, and requested the Avengers actor is given monitored visits with the youngster.\n\nAccording to a previous report from TMZ, 48-year-old Jeremy reportedly turned the tables, and is also asking for sole physical and legal custody.\n\nThey are both expected in court on 7 November.\n\nJeremy and Sonni welcomed Ava together in 2013, and got married in a secret ceremony at the beginning of 2014.\n\nThe former couple previously shared parental duties, penning an agreement on child support just last year. Jeremy was originally paying Sonni $13,000 (\u00a310,400) a month, but this will increase if his yearly income exceeds $2.3million (\u00a31.8million).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS Weekly states the payments will not surpass $200,000 (\u00a3161,000) for the year \u2013 with this money going into an account for their daughter.\n\nSpeaking about fatherhood in a candid interview, he previously told Playboy: \u2018When it\u2019s daddy and Ava time, that\u2019s all I do.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re talking to a guy who\u2019s really happy in his f**king flip-flops right now with his little daughter in her pyjamas running around in the house, waiting for me.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted Jeremy\u2019s reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
