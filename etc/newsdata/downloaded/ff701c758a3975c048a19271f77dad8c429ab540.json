They're a perfect meal for a weekend night or when you have a large crowd to feed \u2014 carnitas are easy for little kids to wrap and eat, and for teenagers and adults to load up and fill up on. If it\u2019s too hot to turn on the oven, you can cook the pork in the slow cooker since it won\u2019t heat up your house. Soft flour tortillas are inexpensive and easy to find in most grocery stores, but if you want to make your own, they\u2019re fun to make, especially with little helpers to roll out the dough. Alternatively, buy fresh corn tortillas and either warm them to make them more pliable, or shallow fry in about an inch of oil until crisp, then drain on paper towels before loading with pork.\n\nSlow-Roasted Pork Carnitas\n\nTraditionally, the pork for carnitas is pulled apart, then put back under the heat at a higher temperature to brown it a bit more, and add some crispy bits, before serving. You can skip that part if you like.\n\nPork:\n\n2\u20133 lb boneless pork shoulder (butt) or boneless country pork ribs\n\ncanola or olive oil or lard, for cooking\n\n1 orange, washed and quartered\n\nchicken or vegetable stock\n\nsalt and pepper\n\nFor serving:\n\nsmall flour or corn tortillas\n\nshredded cheese\n\nwarmed avocado\n\ndiced tomato, diced\n\nfinely chopped onion\n\nsalsa\n\nsour cream\n\ncilantro\n\nlime wedges\n\nPreheat the oven to 300\u00b0F. Cut the meat into a few chunks, heat a generous drizzle of oil or a dab of lard in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat and brown the meat on all sides, transferring it to a shallow baking dish as it browns. Squeeze the orange wedges over the meat and toss in the rinds alongside; add enough stock to almost cover the meat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover with a tight-fitting lid and bake for three hours, until the meat is very tender. Break or pull the meat apart into smaller pieces, remove and discard the orange rind. If you have the time, turn the oven up to 400\u00b0F and roast the meat uncovered for 20-30 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the meat is crisp and brown on the edges. Place the pot of pork directly on the table and surround with tortillas and accompaniments; let everyone serve themselves.\n\nServes 8\u201310.\n\nYou'll Also Love: 3 Ways to Make Nachos for Dinner\n\nHomemade Flour Tortillas\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n\n1/2 tsp. baking powder\n\n1/4 tsp. salt\n\n1/4 cup lard or butter, grated or cut into pieces\n\n2/3 cup water\n\n1 Tbsp. canola or olive oil\n\nIn a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the lard (or grate it in) and blend until well combined. Add the water and oil and stir until the shaggy dough comes together. Turn it out onto the countertop and knead for about a minute \u2014 if it's too sticky, shake a bit of flour over the countertop \u2014 until it's smoother. Cover with a tea towel and let sit for 20 minutes or so, just to let the gluten relax before you roll it out. Divide the dough in half, and then each half in half (and so on) to make 8 to 12 balls, depending on how big you want your tortillas to be. Roll them out on an unfloured surface \u2014 this will allow you to get them nice and thin without them springing back \u2014 until they're very thin (*about 1/8\u201d thick). Set a heavy skillet (cast iron is perfect) over medium-high heat and cook the tortillas in the dry pan until they start to puff slightly and turn just pale golden in spots.\n\nYou don't want your tortillas to brown too much, or those areas will be crunchy and won't roll. Each tortilla will take about a minute \u2014 pile them on a plate as you cook them. Wrap in a tea towel and serve warm.\n\nMakes 8\u201312 tortillas.", "description": "Perfect for a big crowd or a weekend supper, these slow-roasted delights are low effort and high-impact.
