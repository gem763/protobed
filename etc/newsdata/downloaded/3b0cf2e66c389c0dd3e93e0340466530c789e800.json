And now, Loupedeck is taking that year\u2019s worth of feedback to introduce the Loupedeck+, which expands on the original with even more dials and buttons, better software, and integration with more services.\n\nMore dials!\n\nThe biggest addition is the Loupedeck+ will also work with things that aren\u2019t Adobe Lightroom, with added support for Skylum\u2019s Aurora HDR, as well as beta integration with Capture One \u2014 with additional software integrations promised for later this year.\n\nLoupedeck has also added more customizable dials and buttons to the device, and reworked the configuration software from scratch to be easier to use. There\u2019s also a new \u201cCustom Mode\u201d that lets users fully customize the function of every dial on the console.\n\nThe Loupedeck+ is available now for $229. While it might be a little disappointing for previous customers to have their existing console made obsolete so quickly, the company is offering a consolation prize: a $50 cashback offer for owners of the original Loupedeck.", "description": "The Loupedeck+ is an upgraded version of the photo editing console that adds more buttons, reworked software, and better support for more apps", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdRp4UFvqk8OrtuTMwcImR5SCLI=/0x40:2000x1087/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11577343/loupedck_top_down_03_2000x1125.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-21"}
