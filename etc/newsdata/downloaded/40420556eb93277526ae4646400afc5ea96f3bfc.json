It did not say whether the charges were related to the Telegram case.\n\nIran has arrested dozens of judges and judicial officials on similar charges over the past months.\n\nLast year Ghasemzadeh ordered internet service providers in Iran to block access to Telegram, a popular messaging app used by an estimated 40 million Iranians and used by organizers of anti-government protests in late 2017 and early 2018. Some 25 people were killed and 5,000 arrested during the demonstrations.\n\nSince the ban, Iranian youth and tech-savvy citizens use proxy servers to access the service.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
