The report also broadcast claims of horses being beaten and mistreated in other ways.\n\nOn Friday Racing Australia, the national industry body, said it did not have the ability to track racehorses after they retired from competition. It reiterated calls for a national register to be established.\n\nAbout 8,500 horses nationally are retired from the track each year, the ABC reported. Racing Australia said it believed less than 1% of such animals ended up in an abattoir.\n\nThe industry has long drawn criticism from animal welfare groups.\n\nTens of thousands of people are expected to attend Australia's spring racing events. The nation's most prestigious race, the Melbourne Cup, will be held on 5 November.", "description": "It will examine allegations of animal cruelty, after a television report caused widespread anger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/116DB/production/_109278317_11611904-3x2-940x627.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
