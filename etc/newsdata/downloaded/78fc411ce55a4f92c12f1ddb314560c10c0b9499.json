In recent interviews he gave no indications that he was looking to engineer a departure from the management playing field.\n\nThe overall numbers speak for themselves with operating profits coming in at \u00a31.41bn, well above expectations of \u00a31.3bn, despite intense competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl that has squeezed the supermarket sector from the bottom up.\n\nConcern about this squeeze on margins has acted as a bit of a brake on the share price this year, with the share price trying and failing to overcome the 242p level on two occasions over the summer.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland H1 revenues came in at \u00a331.91bn, beating estimates of \u00a331.79bn, as the company looks to enjoy a better H2 with the company optimistic that a good Christmass will allow it to hit its revenue target of just under \u00a365bn.\n\nIt is certain that Mr Lewis will be missed, and he has cited personal reasons for his decision, saying that he believes that he has succeeded in delivering the turnaround plan he was employed to implement. He certainly leaves the business in a better condition than which he found it, however it is telling that his successor hasn\u2019t come from within the existing management structure.\n\nI wonder if investors will wonder the same thing as they digest today\u2019s better than expected results, along with Mr Lewis\u2019s surprise decision to leave.\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
