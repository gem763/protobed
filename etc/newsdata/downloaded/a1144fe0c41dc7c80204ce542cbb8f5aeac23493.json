They are all deftly told. Appelbaum duly mentions the failures of these myriad economic policies, like the Federal Reserve\u2019s callous indifference to the havoc caused when scores went unemployed because of sky-high interest rates in the 1980s. But in Appelbaum\u2019s concluding chapter, his analysis sags. He offers few solutions, aside from a few sentences on the importance of labor unions in counterbalancing the power of corporations. But maybe this makes sense. Appelbaum is something of a creature of the system that economics built, a reporter who once covered the Federal Reserve for the New York Times, even arguing in the book that, beginning in the 1970s, capitalism \u201cbecame a self-satisfied monopolist in the marketplace of ideas, with predictable consequences: in the absence of alternatives, it was difficult to muster the will to deal with its evident shortcomings.\u201d This in some ways, explains where the book fails to deliver. Appelbaum, like most of us, stands in the vast shadow of the economists\u2019 monolithic, totalizing, yet inaccessible ideology. But buried in the book are germs of truly useful ideas.\n\nAppelbaum shows the strangely high degree of consensus in the field of economics, including a 1979 survey of economists that \u201cfound 98 percent opposed rent controls, 97 percent opposed tariffs, 95 percent favored floating exchange rates, and 90 percent opposed minimum wage laws.\u201d And in a moment of impish humor he notes that \u201cAlthough nature tends toward entropy, they shared a confidence that economies tend toward equilibrium.\u201d Economists shared a creepy lack of doubt about how the world worked.\n\nEconomists shared a creepy lack of doubt about how the world worked. But worse, they were wrong.\n\nBut worse, they were wrong. If you look at the economic theories put forth during the economists\u2019 hour\u2014from Friedman\u2019s monetarism to Arthur Laffer\u2019s supply-side economics\u2014Appelbaum, like many others, finds the theories often demonstrably did not do what they were supposed to do. Monetarism didn\u2019t curb inflation, lax antitrust and low regulation didn\u2019t spur innovation, and low taxes didn\u2019t increase corporate investment. Big economic shocks of the 1970s, like the befuddling \u201cstagflation,\u201d provided reasons to abandon previous, more redistributive economic regimes, but a reader still burns to know: How could economists could be so wrong, so often, and so clearly at the expense of the working people in the United States, yet still ultimately triumph so totally? It\u2019s likely because what economists\u2019 ideas did do, quite effectively, was divert wealth from the bottom to the top. This entrenched their power among the winners they helped created.\n\n\n\nSo if you squint, what Appelbaum presents could be seen as a picture of a dramatic class-war, a conservative counter-revolution in reaction to the New Deal government, duplicitously legitimized by a regressive political theory: economics. Or as a more bracing economics writer, John Kenneth Galbraith, once put it: \u201cWhat is called sound economics is very often what mirrors the needs of the respectably affluent.\u201d\n\nIn his conclusion, Appelbaum argues that the economists\u2019 hour is over: Now we have a president who once wrote \u201ctrade is bad\u201d in the margins of a speech on tariffs. However, economic doctrines simply aren\u2019t coherent enough for one person to thoroughly reject. Free market cheerleaders like Friedman were advocates of both LBGTQ rights and immigration, and of deliriously repressive right-wing military regimes all over the world. And it is important that Donald Trump\u2019s only major legislative victory was a regressive tax-cut straight out of the supply-side playbook, something Appelbaum spends an entire chapter chronicling. I\u2019m not convinced the hour is over. Appelbaum\u2019s book shows economists\u2019 dramatic impact on government policy, and thus reveals economics to be not an abstract, disinterested science but a moral and political science all to itself. It\u2019s politics for the technocrats and the well off.\n\nEconomics has failed to come up with an answer for a fundamental political question: what do we do about the losers? A failing to answer this question, almost by definition, creates inequality if not on purpose then through inaction. Due to the high degree of consensus among economists, the answer is likely to be found not in a new, more compassionate version but in a different field entirely.\n\nWhen John Maynard Keynes wrote his tragically optimistic essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, he thought that the automation of compound interest would create a swift-running river of capital that would be so deep and so wide that there would be no scarcity, and thus much less need for economists. Keynes thought that soon they might be about as important as dentists. Of course, instead, the opposite happened. Economists now have an outsized hand in running the government and as sociologist Marion Fourade finds, economics is the best paid and most cited field in the social sciences and economists monopolize the marketplace of ideas. In the 1950s, a Columbia economist complained he made as much as a skilled carpenter. Until we get back to that time, the clock will continue to run on Appelbaum\u2019s nightmarish economists\u2019 hour.", "description": "How can economists be so wrong, so often, and yet still exert so much influence on government policy?", "authors": ["Robin Kaiser-Schatzlein"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/ecab1472f3224c9a5df85f22bf8c0a259c4f232d.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
