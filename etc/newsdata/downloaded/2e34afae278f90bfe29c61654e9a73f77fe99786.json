REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Aramco\u2019s best-laid IPO plans just suffered a drone strike. In the last few weeks, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer had seemed to be getting its stalled listing back on track by identifying a new chairman and naming a squadron of investment bankers to oversee a Riyadh stock offering. Saturday\u2019s air attacks by Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, which knocked out over half Saudi\u2019s national oil output, upend that.\n\nThe strikes on Aramco\u2019s Abqaiq and Khurais facilities are a major escalation of previous Houthi drone launches, which were mostly directed at Saudi energy infrastructure and airports. Abqaiq alone processed 50% of the company\u2019s 10 million barrels per day crude oil production in 2018. Aramco\u2019s maiden international bond prospectus in April identified the facility as critical for its financial condition.\n\nThe world\u2019s oversupplied oil market has some scope to absorb a short-term shock. Developed economies\u2019 oil stocks are above five-year averages, and the combination of a global economic slowdown and increased output by other countries means the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is currently set to produce 1 million barrels per day more than is required to balance the market in 2020, Morgan Stanley analysts reckon. Even before the attacks, the cartel had faced pressure to consider deepening production cuts in place since 2016.\n\nYet while Saudi might welcome a coordinated reduction, it certainly won\u2019t like Saturday\u2019s massive and involuntary unilateral disruption, which Reuters reported on Sunday could take weeks to fix. Aramco might have to draw on the Kingdom\u2019s 188 million barrels of reserves to maintain exports of 7 million barrels per day that mostly go to Asia.\n\nThe best case is that Aramco\u2019s vaunted operational efficiency enables it to restore full production rapidly. In that scenario the $10 a barrel spike in oil prices that consultant Rystad expects might even help bump up the company\u2019s stock market value, which Breakingviews calculates will fall well short of its desired $2 trillion. Yet the latest dramatic evidence of Aramco\u2019s vulnerability, and the possibility of regional reprisals by the volatile Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, make it almost certain that international investors will apply a higher discount rate to its future earnings. That could make renewed impetus around the IPO look premature.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Aramco\u2019s best-laid IPO plans just suffered a drone strike.
