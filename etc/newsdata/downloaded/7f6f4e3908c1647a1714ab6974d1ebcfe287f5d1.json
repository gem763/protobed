Encouragingly, it surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing 13 quarters.\n\n\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, the top and bottom lines grew 29% and 46.1%, respectively. Solid homebuilding fundamentals, and strategic initiatives and buyouts aided its second-quarter results. The same factors are likely to have supported third-quarter results as well.\n\n\n\nHow are Estimates Faring?\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release.\n\n\n\nFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 66 cents, indicating a decline of 20.5% from the year-ago reported earnings of 83 cents per share. Revenues are expected to be $1.15 billion, suggesting a rise of 10.7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nTaylor Morrison Home Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nTaylor Morrison Home Corporation Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nTaylor Morrison Home Corporation price-eps-surprise | Taylor Morrison Home Corporation Quote\n\nFactors at Play\n\n\n\nTaylor Morrison\u2019s primary focus on move-up buyers is expected to have benefited third-quarter earnings, given strong housing market fundamentals. The successful execution of strategic initiatives to boost profitability and building homes on a spec basis are likely to have boosted its performance in quarter to be reported.\n\n\n\nIn order to meet the needs of millennials and baby boomers who want affordable homes in highly desirable communities, it started building homes for entry-level buyers. Notably, these entry-level buyers constitute the majority of the housing market. This gradual shift to entry-level buyers is likely to have aided its top-line growth in the quarter to be reported.\n\n\n\nIn fact, management expects average active community count in the range of 345-355, implying significant improvement from the year-ago reported figure of 275 homes. Also, it projects home closings between 2,200 and 2,400 homes, which points to an increase from 2,115 homes reported a year ago.\n\n\n\nAlthough the company\u2019s strategy to build affordable or lower-priced homes is likely to have improved buyers traffic, the same is expected to have weighed on third-quarter revenues.\n\n\n\nOverall, solid order volume and synergies from the recent acquisitions are likely to have contributed to third-quarter results. However, low selling prices and higher land/labor costs \u2014 which have been a pressing concern for the U.S. homebuilding industry over the last few quarters \u2014 are expected to get reflected in the company\u2019s bottom-line number.\n\n\n\nFor the quarter to be reported, management anticipates home closings gross margin in the mid-to-high 17%, pointing to a decline from the prior-year figure of 18.9%.\n\n\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\n\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Taylor Morrison this time around.
