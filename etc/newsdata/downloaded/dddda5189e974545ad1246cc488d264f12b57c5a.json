PM Lee acknowledged the hundreds of thousands of young people who demonstrated peacefully all over the world last week, including in Singapore at Hong Lim Park, to demand action from governments to slow the warming of the earth and the rising of the seas.\n\n\"We owe them a responsibility to act, and they deserve our full support,\" he said. \"It is the responsibility of our generation to leave future generations with a habitable planet, both through mitigation and adaptation.\"\n\nIn Singapore, where climate change is an existential issue, significant measures have been rolled out to reduce emissions, he noted.\n\nPM Lee had outlined them on Monday at the UN Climate Action Summit. These range from a carbon tax, the first in South-east Asia, to working with the UN to offer technical assistance to other countries.\n\nSingapore will also collaborate with partners to better understand climate change and its impact through research and institutions such as the Asean Specialised Meteorological Centre. The centre, set up in 1993, is based in Singapore.\n\nUsing a variety of data sources including satellite imagery and computer models, it supports national meteorological centres in the region in predicting weather and the climate as well as to monitor and assess land and forest fires, plus the occurrence of transboundary smoke haze for South-east Asia.\n\nBut most importantly, he said, \"we have to inculcate in our populations the mindset that each one of us has a responsibility to live sustainably and in harmony with the environment\".\n\nWhile Singapore will do its part to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, the key threshold for avoiding catastrophic climate change, it is under no illusion that the target will be easy to achieve, he added.\n\n\"Even if we do make it, the problem will not be completely solved, because that will only slow down the rise in sea levels, but will not stop it. But we must try our best, and over time, all countries will have to do more to mitigate climate change,\" PM Lee said.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [NEW YORK] Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has called on world leaders to act on climate change, saying that they owe young people a responsibility to do so. .
