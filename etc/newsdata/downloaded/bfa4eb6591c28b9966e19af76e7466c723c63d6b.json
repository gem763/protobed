These are constantly evolving challenges and we'll keep our policies and approach under advisement.\"\n\nFacebook has notably been slammed for allowing US President Donald Trump to run ads which critics say included debunked information on Democratic candidate Joe Biden.\n\nAnother Democratic hopeful, Senator Elizabeth Warren, stepped up her battle with Facebook by running her own ad with deliberately false information, stating: \"Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election.\"\n\nFacebook noted that similar to broadcasters, it does not seek to censor political messages.\n\n\"We agree it's better to let voters - not companies - decide,\" Facebook said in response to Warren.", "description": "Twitter says world leaders are \"not above\" the rules of the online platform and could see their messages removed or demoted for egregious conduct violating its terms of service.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9277/fa7b6cf151694f708cccd648a747400a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
