Because I heard Beyonce actually tried it on with you once.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA flustered Richard is quick to make sure we all understand the 38-year-old never made a move on him.\n\n\u2018So basically she never tried it on, I don\u2019t know where this \u201ctried it on\u201d came from,\u2019 he replied. \u2018What it is, is that we\u2019ve been friends for many years.\n\nRichard Blackwood wants us all to know Beyonce didn\u2019t \u2018try it on\u2019 with him (Picture: ITV2)\n\n\u2018People saw a video when we did a video together, and she hugged me, and everyone went, \u201cRah, look at that hug!\u201d\u2019\n\nWe have so many questions: How and when did they meet? Has Richard met Blue Ivy? Are they in a WhatsApp chat together? Can we bag an introduction?\n\nBlowing our minds further, he continued: \u2018When I was interviewing Britney Spears, Beyonce was in the film, Austin Powers. We were that close that, when I was filming it, she made me sleep in her trailer while she was going to film.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s how close we are.\u2019\n\nIt sounds a little less like friends, and more like Bey needed someone to take care of her trailer, hun\u2026\n\nBeyonce and Richard Blackwood are apparently bffs and we are shook (Picture: PA)\n\nAnd Katherine Ryan took it upon herself to ask what we\u2019re all secretly thinking.\n\n\u2018Who tells that story?\u2019 she questioned. \u2018Does Beyonce tell that story? Or have only you told that story?\u2019\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time Rich has spoken about his friendship with the Drunk In Love star \u2013 previously claiming she \u2018serenaded him with a song\u2019 while performing with Destiny\u2019s Child bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*insert Sure Jan* gif here.\n\nKatherine Ryan wasn\u2019t quite buying his story (Picture: ITV2)\n\nDuring an appearance on the Dope Black Dads podcast, the Dancing On Ice star stated she later approached him backstage, telling him: \u2018You see I was singing the song to you? I was singing it to you.\u2019\n\nHe explained that he asked her: \u2018So what does that mean?\u2019\n\nTo which she replied: \u2018That\u2019s down to you. I\u2019ll leave it with you,\u2019 before he added: \u2018That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to tell of that story.\u2019\n\nCan someone get Beyonce on the phone because we need some answers ASAP.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for Beyonce for a comment.\n\nDon\u2019t Hate the Playaz airs tonight, at 10pm, on ITV2.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
