Doug Jones (D-AL) defended congressional Democrats\u2019 efforts to explore options on the impeachment of President Donald Trump.\n\nWhen asked for his \u201cdefinitive position\u201d on the issue, Jones, also a former U.S. Attorney for the Clinton administration, laid out the allegations against Trump, which he argued made it constitutionally necessary for Congress to initiate its investigations. He noted one red flag in his view was the behavior of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for Trump.\n\n\u201cMy definitive position, Jeff, is that I\u2019m a potential juror, and we don\u2019t have all the facts yet,\u201d Jones said on \u201cThe Jeff Poor Show.\u201d \u201cI have said I support the House of Representatives trying to get the facts because this is very serious. This is very serious when you\u2019ve got the president potentially offering quid pro quos, even though the quid pro quo is not necessary. But the transcript of that phone call was very disturbing because he has got his personal lawyer running a shadow foreign policy with Ukraine trying to dig up dirt on a political opponent. That is really disturbing. I think it puts our national security at risk. It also an abuse of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it just like I\u2019ve said \u2013 right now, the impeachment process over in the House is going to play out one way or another,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat may or may not come over to the Senate. But when it does, if it does, then I will be ready. We will do our due diligence, and we will act as responsible jurors to determine the facts. That is where I stand now. Where I stand begins with my oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. And it will end that way. And in the middle, we\u2019re going to be putting the pieces of the puzzle together to see if the dots are connected. Sometimes they are. Sometimes they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nJones added, \u201cSo we\u2019ll see how that goes. But right now, wholly inappropriate for folks on both sides of the aisle to go to partisan corners and start giving their opinion on the outcome of what is a very serious process that country should not and does not want. I didn\u2019t ask for this, didn\u2019t want this. But we are where we are and will deal with it the way I think the Constitution demands.\u201d\n\nRegarding the procedure the House of Representatives was using to this point, Jones said he had no qualms with it and that it was similar to how Congress handled both former Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cI think it is proceeding the way it should be,\u201d he added. \u201cThe House appears to be moving expeditiously. I think that is a good thing. It is proceeding in a way that they are getting whatever evidence they can \u2013 similar to the way the things were done in the Clinton impeachment, similar to the way things were done to the Nixon impeachment. You\u2019ve got to do a lot of this behind closed doors. That was done in prior proceedings. I think they are doing it in the right way. People are given an opportunity. This is kind of like a grand jury. This is not a trial. If there is a trial, it will be in front of the United States Senate. So, I think they\u2019re moving quickly. I think they\u2019re moving expeditiously. We\u2019ll see how this plays out. But there obviously working very hard.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Thursday during an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio's WVNN, Sen.
