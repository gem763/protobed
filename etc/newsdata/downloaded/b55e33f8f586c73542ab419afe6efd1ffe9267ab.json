The exhibitions highlight the work of some of the top photographers from around the globe while the screenings focus on current affairs. This year, that includes events ranging from happenings in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThere are 25 exhibits this year. In Sight is taking a look at five notable exhibitions from photographers Lynsey Addario, Adriana Loureiro Fernandez, Kirsten Luce, Laura Morton and Kasia Strek.\n\nAddario\u2019s exhibition examines maternal mortality around the globe. After witnessing a woman named Mamma Sessay lose her life after giving birth in Sierra Leone, Addario said she \u201ccould scarcely believe that something so basic as childbirth could kill hundreds and thousands of women every year,\u201d and so she vowed to spend time documenting maternal death around the world. So, for the past decade, Addario has traveled to Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, India, Haiti, the Philippines, Somaliland and the United States compiling a powerful record, shedding light on this sad but true aspect of life.\n\nFernandez\u2019s work puts the crisis in Venezuela in the spotlight. Fernandez began her project, \u201cParadise Lost,\u201d in 2012, focusing on the turmoil created by rising violence in her country. Of her work, Fernandez says: \u201cHere are everyday encounters with violence and the many shapes it can take, including the emergence of state violence. Here is ongoing political turmoil and a natural beauty that will never surrender to decadence. Together, these stories show an untenable situation set against the background of the promised dream that has now turned into a nightmare. Here, between beauty and horror, is Paradise Lost. Here is an inside view showing how it feels to watch our country die.\u201d\n\nLuce\u2019s exhibition takes us into the dark underbelly of wildlife tourism. Luce\u2019s work began in 2018 on a trip to the Amazon, where tour companies encourage locals to keep wildlife so that tourists can take selfies with them. Designed to raise awareness so that people will stop and think before supporting operations that cause harm to animals, her heartbreaking images also take us to Thailand, where elephants are kept in captivity to perform for tourists and declawed tigers are kept in zoos where tourists can pose with them. Luce\u2019s work is as eye-opening as it is devastating to look at.\n\nMorton\u2019s work, \u201cUniversity Avenue,\u201d takes a close look at daily life in two communities in California\u2019s Bay Area: Palo Alto and East Palo Alto, focusing on one street that traverses both areas. The work takes a look at the stark economic disparity, linked to the tech world, between the two places. As Morton explains, \u201cThis is a story of daily life in two communities living side by side in California\u2019s Bay Area: Palo Alto and East Palo Alto. On one side, Palo Alto has the massive fortunes created by Silicon Valley\u2019s technology industry, while in East Palo Alto, mostly on the other side of Highway 101, the community has been squeezed out, away from these fortunes \u2026 a documentary record of residents of both communities who are, in their own way, working and going about their daily lives while living in the shadow of the technology giants.\u201d\n\nFinally, Strek\u2019s project, \u201cThe Price of Choice,\u201d takes a hard look at women\u2019s right to choose around the world. For this series of images, Strek traveled to Poland, the Philippines, Egypt, El Salvador and Ireland. Of her project, Strek says: \u201cToday, a century after women in some countries were first granted the right to vote, there are still threats to women\u2019s rights, even in developed countries such as Poland, Italy and the United States of America, to name only three, where laws thought to be well-established are proving to be fragile. I undertook this work not just to tell the stories, but also as a reminder that change is not fully and permanently accomplished until it is accessible to all and understood and accepted by the majority.\"\n\nYou can find out more information about all the activities happening at this year\u2019s festival on its website, here.\n\n\n\nA man walks past a stand on a street selling second-hand clothes in Caracas, Venezuela last February.

Signs state that they are transferred to a more comfortable area for the night after the school closes, but it is not true. (Kirsten Luce/National Geographic)\n\n\n\nGluay Hom, a 4-year-old male Asian elephant, has a broken leg and open sores on his face. He is housed beneath the stadium where elephants perform at Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo, on the outskirts of Bangkok. His was the worst case of neglect that we witnessed in the course of the month spent covering the elephant tourism industry in Thailand. Our fixer returned six months later \u2014 in December 2018 \u2014 and found him still languishing there in the same condition.

The entire show is on ice, and the bears are muzzled. (Kirsten Luce/National Geographic)\n\n\n\nGregory Smith wanted to have his own business and went to barber school at age 49.

(Laura Morton)\n\n\n\nWala, 39, never wanted to have kids, and panicked when she found out she was pregnant in December 2018. Although she comes from a wealthy, educated family and has lived abroad, she could never tell them. Her mother would insist on her keeping the baby, since, in Egypt, a child brings good luck, and abortion could cause the anger of Allah to strike the family. (Kasia Strek/Item)\n\n\n\nTwo days before the referendum on abortion in Ireland, a feminist group named Rosa organized an artistic performance in the center of Dublin. About 40 women dressed as characters from \"The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\" marched through the streets and by the River Liffey in May 2018 to raise awareness on reproductive rights. (Kasia Strek/Item)\n\n\n\nFabella Hospital in Manilla advises women to stay no more than 24 hours after giving birth and has reduced the number of deliveries, concentrating mostly on complicated cases. But there is still not enough space for everyone, and as many as four women can share a bed. Because of staff shortages, experienced mothers explain to mothers of first babies how to care for their newborn children.
