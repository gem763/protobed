They pointed to public statements made by the president and the White House\u2019s summary of his call with the leader of Ukraine, both of which are driving the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution establishes impeachment as the proper mechanism for addressing these abuses; therefore, the House should proceed with the impeachment process, fairly, openly and promptly,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cThe president\u2019s refusal to cooperate in confirming (or disputing) the facts already on the public record should not delay or frustrate the House\u2019s performance of its constitutional duty.\u201d\n\nRead the full commentary here.\n\nAn op-ed from 17 former Watergate special prosecutors:\n\n\n\nWe believe there exists compelling prima facie evidence that President Trump has committed impeachable offenses. https://t.co/q1u7o8OQ0C pic.twitter.com/tKEXrSsp4r \u2014 Washington Post \ud83c\udf83pinions (@PostOpinions) October 10, 2019\n\nThe Watergate prosecutors repeatedly compared Trump to Nixon, who resigned after the House Judiciary Committee adopted three articles of impeachment against him: one for obstruction, one for abuse of power and one for contempt of Congress.\n\n\u201cIn our considered view, the same three articles of impeachment could be specified against Trump, as he has demonstrated serious and persistent abuses of power that in our view satisfy the constitutional standard of \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors,\u2019\u201d the op-ed reads.\n\nHouse Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry last month following a whistleblower complaint about a call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Also last month, the White House released a reconstruction of that conversation, during which Trump repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate a top political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe call took place days after Trump ordered his administration to withhold millions in American military aid that Congress had appropriated for Ukraine. Trump has denied stalling the funding in exchange for a political favor, but critics say his demand for a Biden investigation in the context of that withheld aid represents a clear quid pro quo.\n\nThe members of the Watergate team also pointed to text messages released by the chairs of three House committees last week that appear to show Trump administration officials pressuring a Ukrainian official for political favors in exchange for cooperation from the U.S. government.\n\nThe former prosecutors wrote that recent efforts by the White House to stonewall Democrats\u2019 inquiries should not deter lawmakers, arguing that any impropriety by the president \u201crequires firm and resolute action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Constitution provides for the elected representatives of the people to resort to impeachment in extraordinary circumstances showing that this drastic remedy is necessary to restrain, and possibly remove, a president who has engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cLawmakers should not allow any refusal by the president to cooperate in its process to frustrate the performance of its constitutional duties.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nRick Perry Subpoenaed In House's Trump Impeachment Probe\n\nEx-Trump Adviser Says It's Inappropriate For President To Seek Foreign Political Interference\n\nRudy Giuliani Planned Vienna Trip 1 Day After Arrested Associates Were Headed There: Report\n\nLove HuffPost?
