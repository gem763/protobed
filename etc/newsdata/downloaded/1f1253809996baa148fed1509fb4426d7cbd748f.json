Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, met with a fugitive Chinese billionaire at a suite in the luxurious Hays-Adams Hotel in Washington.\n\nThe billionaire, Guo Wengui, who is also known as Miles Kwok, was living in New York City and had landed on China\u2019s most-wanted list, accused of bribery, fraud and money laundering. He was also a dissident and fierce critic of Beijing, seeking political asylum in the United States. And Mr. Bannon \u2014 increasingly obsessed with the emerging China threat \u2014 was eager to talk about the Communist Party, corruption and American naval operations in the South China Sea.\n\nSince their first discussion in October 2017, they have met dozens of times \u2014 in Dallas, on Mr. Guo\u2019s yacht and, more often, at the billionaire\u2019s $67.5 million apartment in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park. The two shared a stage two weeks ago in Manhattan, at a news conference they organized to announce plans to set up a $100 million fund to investigate corruption and aid people they deem victims of Chinese government persecution.\n\n\u201cWe both naturally despise the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Mr. Guo said in an interview last week, referring to Mr. Bannon. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve become partners.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWe both naturally despise the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d the fugitive, Guo Wengui said, explaining his partnership with the former Trump strategist Stephen K.
