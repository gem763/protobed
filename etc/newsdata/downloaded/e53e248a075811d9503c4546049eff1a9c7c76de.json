If that is different from the one released by the White House, then perhaps there is still a smoking gun to be found. But if not, then as it stands, Democrats would be pushing for the most serious verdict possible, removal of the president from office, on a shaky case. It is worth asking why Trump\u2019s behavior was already deemed impeachment-worthy before such critical pieces of evidence were available.\n\nMat\u00e9 also called attention to \u201cRussiagate,\u201d which he considers an unsuccessful attempt to sabotage President Trump.\n\nFor Democrats to once again oppose Trump via a militarist, Cold War \u201cscandal\u201d risks more danger for Ukraine, Russia, and their own 2020 prospects. We all know how the last one turned out: three years of innuendo, discredited \u201cbombshells,\u201d and an investigation that not only found no Trump-Russia conspiracy but, upon scrutiny, almost no actual contact between Trump and Russia\u2014insofar as \u201cRussia\u201d means the government that his campaign supposedly conspired with, not just Russian passport-holders or people who claim to know them. It should now be clear what Russiagate meant for the cause of defeating Trump in 2020.\n\nMat\u00e9 goes on to discuss how a Democrat-controlled effort to impeach President Trump could result in Republicans having the opportunity to \u201chighlight Democratic double standards.\u201d\n\nMat\u00e9 said:\n\nEven if Trump and Giuliani\u2019s worst suspicions about Biden are incorrect, what is already established is damning enough. Hunter Biden obtained his lucrative board seat on a Ukrainian gas company despite having no experience in the country, and just months after his father\u2019s administration backed a coup that overthrew its government.\\\n\nHe added, \u201cThat very fact will weaken any Democratic effort to highlight Trump\u2019s efforts to enrich himself and his family through the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nIn a Jacobin roundtable, Samuel Moyn, a Yale Law School professor, admits he is \u201cworried that we haven\u2019t taken the risks seriously\u201d when it comes to impeaching President Trump.\n\nMoyn, who considers the results of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation a \u201cdud,\u201d says his thoughts on the issue of impeachment remain political more than legal.\n\nBased on the transcript provided by the White House, Moyn said, \u201cI would not say it\u2019s totally clear what exactly was being promised and in exchange for what.\u201d He went on:\n\nIf impeachment becomes a distraction from that much more pressing campaign to save the Democratic Party for the Left, then it will have been a disaster. Now, it could work in another way. I appreciate that Max and others contend that impeachment could serve the Left, but we have to be honest what the risks are, not just what the opportunities are.\n\nMoyn goes on to claim the \u201cimpeachment hearings could become a kind of referendum on how to diminish the imperial presidency.\u201d He added:\n\nBut my sense is that that\u2019s not going to happen, and it would be much better for the Left to put its claims about endless war and economic inequality to the people and try to figure out how to construct a majority for stopping those things. Impeachment seems unrelated to that effort.\n\nMoyn also insisted Democrats must work for the people and that impeachment will not heal the divide between centrists and progressives.\n\n\u201cWhat would certainly be best for the Left is to put the focus on the actual differences in our vision of America and the contest between centrists and progressives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be what impeachment does.\u201d", "description": "As talks of impeachment continue to swirl among Democrats, two leftist individuals are warning that it will most likely end negatively.", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19275598831667-e1570046902729-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
