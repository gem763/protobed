Edgars, Jet and CNA are part of the Edcon group.\n\nAbsa bought the card portfolio for R10bn in 2012, after an embattled Edcon sold it to make some money as it struggled with a large debt burden.\n\nThe group continued to bleed since then, and earlier this year a rescue plan, supported by the Public Investment Corporation, gave it a R2.7bn lifeline as landlords granted it rent reductions in exchange for stakes in the company.\n\n\u201cThe Transaction cements RCS as the pre-eminent provider of outsourced credit solutions in the region, providing an indication to the market that BNP Paribas Personal Finance is committed to South Africa,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe deal will be financed by cash and funding provided by Rand Merchant Bank and Standard Bank.", "description": "Absa bought the card portfolio for R10bn in 2012", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1955/e8814de429e747e589c23da6fa42fd1f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
