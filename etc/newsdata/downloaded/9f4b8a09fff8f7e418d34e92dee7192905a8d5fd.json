(Michael Short/Bloomberg News)\n\nElizabeth Holmes once topped a Forbes list of the world\u2019s youngest self-made female billionaires. Now she allegedly can\u2019t pay her legal fees.\n\nThree Cooley LLP lawyers representing the embattled Theranos founder in a lawsuit want off the case, writing in court papers filed Sept. 30 that Holmes hasn\u2019t paid them in more than a year.\n\n\u201cFurther, given Ms. Holmes\u2019s current financial situation, Cooley has no expectation that Ms. Holmes will ever pay it for its services as her counsel,\u201d Stephen Neal, John Dwyer and Jeffrey Lombard wrote in the filing, which was first reported by the Mercury News. \u201cThus, it is unfair and unreasonable to require Cooley to continue representing Ms. Holmes in this action.\u201d\n\nHolmes dropped out of Stanford University at 19 to form Theranos in 2003. The Palo Alto company promised to revolutionize health care by requiring only a pinprick of blood to run hundreds of tests. At its peak, it was valued at $9 billion and had a partnership with Walgreens.\n\nThe company\u2019s decline began in 2015, when a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that its machines weren\u2019t giving accurate results. By last year, Theranos had been shuttered and Holmes indicted on fraud charges that could carry up to 20 years in prison. The downfall of the once-celebrated start-up and its CEO has been chronicled in a documentary, a podcast and a best-selling book.\n\nIn the class-action civil case, filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, consumers accuse Holmes, Theranos and Walgreens of perpetuating a \u201cmassive fraud.\u201d They also allege Theranos and Walgreens medically battered them by taking blood draws under \u201cfalse pretenses.\u201d Holmes, Theranos and Walgreens are fighting the allegations.\n\nThe judge has not yet made a ruling on the Cooley lawyers\u2019 request to withdraw.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Sackler family is trying to shield billions in opioid profits through Purdue Pharma bankruptcy, states say\n\nFacebook CEO defends being a billionaire in live Q&A", "description": "Her lawyers say they haven't been paid in more than a year and want off the case.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter", "October At Pm", "Brittany Shammas Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
