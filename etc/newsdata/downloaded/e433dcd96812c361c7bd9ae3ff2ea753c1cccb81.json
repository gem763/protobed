Another 15 percent of the subgroup said that they \u201cfavor\u201d a MAGA hat ban on their campus.\n\n\u201cOf course they shouldn\u2019t be banned,\u201d one student at Clemson University said after the survey. \u201cTrump supporters don\u2019t wear them much anymore \u2014 which says a lot [about] how confident they are about Trump!\u201d\n\n\u201cBanning MAGA hats is stupid. What\u2019s more stupid? Wearing one,\u201d one student respondent from UC Riverside added.\n\n\u201cOther respondents defended the right of their peers to express themselves. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not a Trump supporter at all, but you can\u2019t ban a phrase (especially a non-crude and harmless phrase),\u201d a student from Bossier Parish Community College in Louisiana wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s 100% against the freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nIn July, Breitbart News reported that a student at the University of Florida was attacked for wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. The student, a former football player, claimed that a group of four or five girls started pushing and punching him upon realizing that he was wearing a MAGA hat. Although the student was not injured, the incident served as a reminder of the state of civil discourse on campus.\n\nBreitbart News reported on another College Pulse poll in September that revealed that 73 percent of conservative college students self-censor in the classroom to avoid academic consequences.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "A new poll revealed that almost 30 percent of Democratic college students want to ban \"Make America Great Again\" hats on their campus.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/09/MAGA-hat-fire-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
