But it's unclear how he can do that without breaking a law requiring him to seek a three-month delay if no deal is in the offing.\n\nThe EU has almost no incentive to strike a deal in the coming week. Since it looks as if Mr Johnson is legally bound to postpone Brexit, they're hoping a subsequent election or referendum will break the impasse and unlock a different way out.\n\nThe entire British political debate now revolves around whether, and how, Mr Johnson can find a way around the law; or whether he'll obey the law but use it as a springboard for an anti-elite election campaign.\n\nCiti's scenario modelling came in a report published on Tuesday by an influential British think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which showed that Mr Johnson's big-spending budget pledges are now closing in on the magnitude promised in Mr Corbyn's 2017 election manifesto.\n\nCiti's base case is that Brexit will be delayed again, such that the economy will stutter along for the next few years, growing a cumulative 3.6 per cent over the calendar years 2019-22.\n\nBut if Labour won the most seats at the election expected to be held soon, and formed a government backed by other left and centre-left parties, Citi expects a second Brexit referendum in which Britain would vote to stay in the EU.\n\nCiti said it was unclear if the positive effect of cancelling Brexit would outweigh the potential damage from Mr Corbyn's economic plans such as higher company taxes, nationalising industries, transferring shares in companies to workers and cutting the working week to four days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in fact Citi's forecast assumes that Mr Corbyn would not be able to implement most of these plans, as he'd be held back by his coalition partners the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, which are more centrist.\n\nGrowth in this scenario in 2019-22 is a cumulative 5.3 per cent, driven by much faster growth in business and residential investment.\n\nCiti doesn't expect Labour's Jeremy Corbyn would be in a position to implement all his policies. Getty\n\nIn a scenario where Britain leaves the EU with a transition deal, cumulative growth out to 2022 is 4.4 per cent; but in a no-deal Brexit, it's just 1 per cent.\n\nIn a no-deal Brexit, \"the current uncertainty would be eliminated but would be replaced by new uncertainty about the UK's place in the world ... you wouldn't expect a rebound in investment at all,\" Mr Schulz said.\n\nBrexit has already left the British economy up to \u00a366 billion ($120 billion), or 3 per cent, smaller than would have been expected now based on growth trends at the time of the June 2016 referendum.\n\nMeanwhile, the British tax and customs agency estimated that businesses would fork out a collective \u00a315 billion a year in new red tape costs after a no-deal Brexit. It would cost \u00a328 for a high-volume trader to fill in the forms for each load imported, taking an average of 1 hour and 45 minutes for a staff member to complete the forms. The outsourced cost of doing this admin would be \u00a356 per consignment.", "description": "The benefit of Brexit likely being called off could outweigh the damage caused by a limited version of his radical policies, Citi says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2258%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/69dea75b71cd37c689427bd1535f559940fcf200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
