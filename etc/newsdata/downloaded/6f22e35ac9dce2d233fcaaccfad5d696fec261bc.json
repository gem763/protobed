The Times launched \u201cThe Daily\u201d in 2017; The Post has \u201cPost Reports\u201d; and NPR has \u201cUp First\u201d on the news side. Last month, subscription sports media company The Athletic launched \u201cThe Lead\u201d with host Kavitha Davidson. As other shows have pioneered, the idea behind ESPN\u2019s offering is to harness the power of a large newsroom\u2019s reporting and analysis with a prominent host for an increasingly popular format.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost this is about sports and sports are fun and sports are exciting,\u201d Kimes said in an interview. \u201cThey can be serious and they delve into social and cultural issues \u2014 we\u2019re going to do investigative stories \u2014 but there should be room for joy and passion and I think that\u2019s what makes sports different generally, and also the podcast.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs for what an episode might look like, Kimes cited exploring big stories such as a July piece by NBA reporter Ramona Shelburne on how Kawhi Leonard lured Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted to do when I was reading that story was to find out how Ramona got wind of that story and how she reported it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect 20-minute conversation.\u201d\n\nThe show will also have room to highlight less high-profile stories, for instance a piece by Aishwarya Kumar about how elite chess players physically train for their matches, Kimes said. Other episodes could be more timely, and feature a close examination of a big playoff game. ESPN\u2019s reporters are regularly talking about their reporting on a bevy of ESPN\u2019s platforms, but Kimes said the podcast is set up to probe deeper and illuminate both the reporting process and also new layers to big stories.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBased in Los Angeles, Kimes will work with a team of five recently hired audio producers to create episodes that will be ready every Monday through Friday in time for the morning commute on the East Coast.\n\nKimes has been a senior writer at ESPN since 2014 when she was hired from Bloomberg Businessweek, where she was a reporter writing investigative pieces about companies such as Sears and Caterpillar. At ESPN, she has profiled NFL stars such as Aaron Rodgers and the Bennett brothers while building up credentials as an NFL analyst. Earlier this year, she was a color commentator on Los Angeles Rams telecasts during the preseason.\n\nTo prepare for the podcast, Kimes said she had been listening to noted NPR interviewer Terry Gross.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCuriosity will be the driving force behind this,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe target audience is me. I\u2019m 34, I listen to a ton of sports news, I consume a ton of podcasts. I read a lot, I like good stories but I also have limited time and I\u2019d like to have something that entertains me but also gives me something to talk about with other people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKimes will continue to host her podcast \u201cThe Mina Kimes Show\u201d and said she\u2019d eventually be back on TV, appearing on afternoon opinion shows such as \u201cHighly Questionable\u201d and \u201cAround the Horn.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The ESPN senior writer\u2019s new venture will debut Oct. 21.", "authors": ["Ben Strauss", "Sports", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_-EMRU56URc5DwBK8kDbJeOCJd8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSOBNLPTRJDXNETGJGHGKRH3RY.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
