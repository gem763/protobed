Hopefully. I\u2019ve cried enough to last me a career.\u201d\n\nShe then proceeded to speak movingly about the lowest parts of her rollercoaster journey to the top.\n\nHow in Rio after another global championship tilt had turned sour, this time at the 2016 Olympics, she turned to Jess Ennis-Hill and told her she did not know whether she wanted to continue.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIt was probably in the moment at the time,\u201d said Johnson-Thompson. \u201cBut I was fed up of this feeling that my performances weren\u2019t up to scratch to compete against other heptathletes.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to give up on something I truly believed but\u2026\u201d\n\nShe paused, wiping a tear from her eye, took a deep breath and with a smile continued: \u201cI\u2019m so happy now that I wasn\u2019t crazy in thinking I could do this.\u201d\n\nIn the Qatari capital seven years of pressure was finally released as she stood on the podium to receive her gold medal.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not been very straightforward for me. It\u2019s not been easy for me. I had to move coach. I had to move country, I had to learn a new language and settle in. I tore everything up and started again.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe last two world championships have been heartbreaking for me, my mum and my team. Mid-heptathlon, I\u2019ve gone back to my hotel and cried and cried for hours when things have gone badly.\n\n\u201cThose were the low points of my career, after the high jump in London in 2017 and the long jump in 2015 in Beijing. The Rio Olympics as well. I\u2019ve had a lot of bad years. I\u2019m just so happy that I came out in front for a change.\u201d\n\nJohnson-Thompson did not just come out in front. Her total of 6981 points improved by 26 points the British record, leapfrogging her from third to first in the UK rankings ahead of Olympic champions Denise Lewis and Jess Ennis.\n\nHer 304-point winning margin was the biggest in a world heptathlon since 1987. It also ended the three-year winning streak of Nafi Thiam.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nKilling Eve star Jodie Comer took to Instagram to congratulate her close pal. \u201dWe couldn\u2019t be prouder of you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re the best\u2026it\u2019s actually official x\u201d\n\nJohnson-Thompson\u2019s focus now switches to the Tokyo Olympics where she will go from being the hunter to the hunted.\n\n\u201cI know what it's like to finish second and what it's like when you want to win and prove yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will be a dangerous Nafi I compete against next year. I\u2019m going to have to step up.\u201d", "description": "The 26-year-old tasted glory in Doha when she broke the British record with a score of 6,981 points to win gold for the first time", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20463878.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Doha-2019-IAAF-World-Championships-Qatar-04-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
