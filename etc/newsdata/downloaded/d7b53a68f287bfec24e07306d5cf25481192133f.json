He moved from one homeless encampment to the next until arriving earlier this year at his current spot by the 880 freeway and train tracks.\n\nMr. Holys loves talking about wine and laments that he has few people around him who share his passion. Over the relentless din of eight lanes of traffic and Amtrak and commuter trains rolling past his encampment in East Oakland, he evokes Opus, the Napa Valley cabernet blend, and Ch\u00e2teau Ducru-Beaucaillou, the left-bank Bordeaux. He smiles at the memory of sampling a 1974 Mondavi Reserve cabernet sauvignon.\n\nBut pinot noir is his favorite grape. \u201cWhen it\u2019s good and on point it\u2019s an extraordinary experience,\u201d he says, shirtless and in shorts on an unusually hot day last week.\n\nMr. Holys sees parallels between the cultivation of wine and his struggles. Pinot noir vines in particular are fragile and finicky, he says; the skins are thinner than other varieties and the best vines are stressed to produce better fruit.\n\n\u201cRoots are made to suffer. They have to strain for water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor for what people have to go through.\u201d\n\nMr. Holys worked at restaurants where it was not uncommon to serve a $600 bottle of Puligny-Montrachet, the venerable Burgundy. If there was anything left in the bottle when the patrons left, he made sure to drip the remnants into his own glass.", "description": "As life unraveled, a skilled wine steward joined the swelling ranks of homeless people in tents across the San Francisco Bay Area.", "authors": ["Thomas Fuller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/us/00sommelier01-promo/00sommelier01-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
