As Bush\u2019s predecessor, Ronald Reagan, once wrote into the margins of a Pentagon intelligence report: \u201cAn Iranian victory is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBut three years later, as U.S. armor repelled Hussein\u2019s soldiers from neighboring oil-rich Kuwait, President George H.W. Bush suddenly rediscovered the Kurds as a possible check to Baghdad\u2019s power. \u201cThe Iraqi people should put Saddam aside, and that would facilitate the resolution of all these problems,\u201d Bush said in early March of 1991, as U.S. victory seemed imminent. Believing that Bush had their backs, Kurds in the north and Shi\u2019a Iraqis in the south launched uprisings against the Saddam regime.\n\nBut the U.S. did not have the Kurds\u2019 backs. Despite their territorial gains and open call for Hussein\u2019s arrest, the American commander, General Norman Schwarzkopf, did not advance to Baghdad; instead, he negotiated a settlement that permitted Iraq to use helicopters for logistical purposes. The Iraqis instead used helicopters as gunships, raining steel and chemicals down on Kurdish positions, killing thousands and displacing many more. The U.S. more or less looked the other way as Kurds fled for safety under a no-fly zone in the north. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that outside powers should be interfering in the internal affairs of Iraq,\u201d State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at the time.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. soon engaged northern Iraqi Kurds as only they could: by setting up a CIA station. Led by operations officer Robert Baer, the CIA in 1995 negotiated a truce between rival Kurdish factions and worked with them on a plan to capture or kill Saddam. \u201cIt\u2019s the most efficient group we\u2019ve dealt with in the past 20 or 30 years,\u201d Baer told me today. \u201cThey\u2019ve got their own agenda, no doubt about it, but they are the only proxies we have in that part of the world.\u201d\n\nBaer, the Kurds, and a group of Iraqi army collaborators plotted not only to attack Hussein\u2019s home, but to smash his army and foment an insurrection. But with mixed signals from Washington\u2014plotting to kill a foreign leader is, after all, illegal\u2014the operation was compromised, and Hussein turned the opposition back\u2026 after a Kurdish force had already wiped out three Iraqi divisions. In the chaotic aftermath, one Kurdish faction aligned itself with Saddam, who launched an offensive, captured the northern city of Erbil, and executed 700 Kurds.\n\nThe subsequent U.S. embrace of the Kurds during the Iraq War of 2003 was full of contradictions. George W. Bush and his neoconservative war architects used Hussein\u2019s attacks on the Kurds as a pretext for the invasion. \u201cOn this very day 15 years ago, Saddam Hussein launched a chemical weapons attack on the Iraqi village of Halabja,\u201d Bush announced, just four days before the U.S. \u201cshock and awe\u201d bombing began. \u201cWith a single order the Iraqi regime killed thousands of men and women and children, without mercy or without shame. Saddam Hussein has proven he is capable of any crime.\u201d Bush, of course, did not note the U.S.\u2019s knowledge or tolerance of previous Iraqi chemical attacks.\n\nMiddle East geopolitics is an altar on which the Kurds are constantly sacrificed.\n\nNevertheless, the Kurds became a bloc on which Americans could rely in the fight against Hussein, then the Baa\u2019thist insurgency, then Al Qaeda in Iraq, then ISIS. But as President Barack Obama found\u2014first in withdrawing troops from Iraq in 2011, then in seeking to stop ISIS\u2019s expansion in 2014\u2014to support or arm Kurdish forces is to essentially endorse their longtime aspiration for independent statehood, a prospect that threatens Iraq\u2019s already-tenuous federal government, as well as the ambitions of Turkey. Middle East geopolitics is an altar on which the Kurds are constantly sacrificed.\n\nAll that said, it\u2019s not clear there\u2019s any real geopolitical reasoning behind Trump\u2019s decision to let the Turks run roughshod over Kurdish Syria. The president, like his predecessors, is always willing to sacrifice masses of peoples to some greater interest, but in this case it\u2019s unclear what that interest is, other than perhaps to declare an empty victory against the Islamic State and try to claim credit for ending one of the U.S.\u2019s smallest and newest military engagements. That, at least, fits with the nationalist \u201cpopulism\u201d that brought him to power. \u201cHe\u2019s just pulling us out of the Middle East, into an isolationist position,\u201d Baer told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no constituency [for this] other than \u2018Why are we wasting all this money on these ragheads?\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump, confronted by withering criticism of the move Monday, quickly tweeted that if Turkey\u2014a NATO ally of the U.S., pledged to collective security of all the member nations\u2014did attack the Kurds in Syria, or tried anything else \u201cthat I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d But the blowback from his withdrawal announcement will continue to snowball. \u201cThe obvious thing is the Kurds will never trust us again,\u201d Baer said. \u201cThey\u2019ll align with Damascus, the Russians, the Iranians now. We\u2019ve just told them: You want to survive this? Deal with Iran.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, he believes, Turkey\u2019s irredentist claims will continue apace. Tehran will seek an even greater hand in regional affairs than the U.S. invasion of Iraq already gave it. Iranian involvement will further arouse Arab states\u2019 disquiet; ISIS might reconstitute itself again, as Sunni Muslims in the region search desperately for some kind of security. And, of course, tens of thousands of people are likely to die before even a best-case scenario kicks in.\n\nIn previous U.S. administrations, sacrifices of Kurdish autonomy and safety were made, mostly wrongly, in the interests of broader stability concerns. While the Trump administration continues this official policy of periodic betrayal, the move itself is pure Trump: spontaneous, surprising even to advisers, destabilizing, and ultimately pointless, except insofar as it earns him another ruthless despot\u2019s approval on the telephone. \u201cOur pulling out is going to cause more chaos and more violence,\u201d Baer told me. \u201cI don\u2019t advocate ignorance as a foreign policy strategy, but he\u2019s going to give it a try.\u201d", "description": "Trump's withdrawal from Syria is of a piece with his predecessors' treatment of the ethnic minority as a geopolitical pawn.", "authors": ["Adam Weinstein"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/42197ebb404b1f6d32d8b4ed2e2f8965e62c0599.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
