In that same press conference, Mulvaney said the administration withheld Ukraine aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate alleged events surrounding the 2016 election. Mulvaney then reversed parts of his press conference in a subsequent statement.\n\nThe president's Cabinet meeting is scheduled for 11:30 a.m.", "description": "The president is under fire from Democrats and Republicans lately, all while he faces an impeachment inquiry", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/13/aeea6ae3-be86-4c1b-b1fe-36f7602ff863/thumbnail/1200x630/3e5d4419fa605c6c46ecc255197b76c7/rtx6z7sb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
