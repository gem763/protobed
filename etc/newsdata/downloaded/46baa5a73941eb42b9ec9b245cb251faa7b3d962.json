What\u2019s more, pediatric residents become less likely to inquire about gun safety following a mass shooting, researchers found.\n\nPhysicians\u2019 training may be limited when it comes to communicating about gun safety, lead study author Carole Stipelman, a pediatrician and associate professor at the University of Utah School of Medicine, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAsking the questions may seem more difficult after mass shootings,\u201d she added. \u201cAvoidance is a common response to trauma and it is one of the diagnostic criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder. In the case of a mass shooting, it\u2019s a shared community traumatic event.\u201d\n\nThe second leading cause of death among U.S. children and teens aged 1 to 19 in 2016 was gun-related injuries, coming in behind motor-vehicle crashes, according to 2018 research published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAnd while U.S. gun owners with kids are more likely than non-parents to keep firearms unloaded and locked away, three in 10 gun owners who have kids under 18 at home report having a firearm that\u2019s \u201cboth loaded and easily accessible to them all of the time\u201d while they\u2019re at home, according to the Pew Research Center. Some 7% of kids in the U.S. \u2014 translating to 4.6 million children \u2014 live in households with at least one unlocked and loaded gun, one national 2015 survey showed, double estimates from 2002.\n\n\u201cAs mass shootings have become commonplace, it is important to improve communication if we can prevent even one death by reminding parents to lock up a gun,\u201d Stipelman said.\n\nIn the present study, Stipelman and her co-authors analyzed data from 16,576 regular pediatric visits involving 77 pediatric residents and 26 faculty members from January 2017 through June 2018, a stretch of time that included the deadly Oct. 1, 2017 Las Vegas music-festival shooting and Feb. 14, 2018 Parkland, Fla., school shooting. They supplemented the screening with questions about working smoke alarms and gun storage.\n\nPediatric residents and clinicians were more likely to ask parents about smoke-alarm safety than about gun safety, the study concluded. And following the Las Vegas and Parkland mass shootings, residents became less likely to raise the gun-safety issue than they were before.\n\n\u201cFurther work is needed to identify and overcome barriers that prevent physicians from discussing gun safety with patients,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nThe American Medical Association, which has called gun violence a public-health crisis, offers educational materials for physicians to discuss firearm safety with parents at pediatric visits, patients at risk of suicide and patients experiencing domestic violence.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, meanwhile, has sounded the alarm about firearm-related homicides, suicides and unintentional injuries to kids and teens. The organization recommends that pediatricians and other child health-care providers advise parents on \u201cthe dangers of allowing children and adolescents to have access to guns inside and outside the home,\u201d including by asking questions about the presence of firearms and by urging gun-owning parents to prevent children\u2019s access to firearms.\n\nThe AAP last summer also encouraged parents to ask fellow parents, \u201cIs there an unlocked gun in your house?\u201d ahead of children\u2019s play dates.\n\n\u201cWhen guns are in the house, we need to make every effort to keep kids safe. That means locking up guns and keeping ammunition safe and separate from the guns and locked up as well,\u201d AAP spokeswoman Alison Tothy, a Chicago pediatric emergency-medicine doctor, said at the time. \u201cGun injuries are often fatal. One hundred percent of them are preventable.\u201d", "description": "This study analyzed data from 16,576 regular pediatric visits involving 77 pediatric residents and 26 faculty members.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN506_Childr_ZG_20190717085550.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
