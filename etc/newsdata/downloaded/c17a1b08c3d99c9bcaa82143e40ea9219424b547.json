The US State Department urges American travellers to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d everywhere.\n\nUntil 2015, landlocked Burkina Faso was largely spared the revolt that hit Mali and then Niger, its neighbours to the north.\n\nBut jihadists \u2014 some linked to Al-Qaeda, others to the so-called Islamic State \u2014 started infiltrating the north, then the east, and then endangered its southern and western borders.\n\nCombining guerrilla hit-and-run tactics with road mines and suicide bombings, the insurgents have killed nearly 600 people, according to a toll compiled by AFP. Civil society groups put the tally at more than 1,000.\n\nAround 300,000 people have fled their homes and almost 3,000 schools have closed. The impact on an overwhelmingly rural economy is escalating, dislocating trade and markets.\n\n\u2013 Escalation \u2013\n\nAttacks are \u201cmore widespread\u2026 more violent, bloodier, they lead to inter-community violence and the creation of self-defence militias,\u201d says Ousmane Amirou Dicko, emir of the historic Islamic kingdom of Liptako, reaching into Niger and Mali.\n\n\u201cThe north has been forgotten, and it\u2019s hard to recover that in the space of two or three years,\u201d adds the traditional ruler, noting a widening gap in standards with the south in the past 50 years.\n\nA curfew has been imposed in the east, while major northern cities such as Djibo and Dori live as though in a state of siege.\n\n\u201cIn Djibo, at 2:00 pm, everyone \u2014 police, gendarmes, soldiers, civil servants \u2014 heads to the military camp\u201d where they spend the night, a policeman told AFP on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u2013 Weak army \u2013\n\nPoorly-trained and chronically short of equipment, many members of the security forces feel overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the fight. Not a day goes by without something happening, even if the press doesn\u2019t know about it,\u201d said a policeman who has been made several tours of duty in the north.\n\nBefore protests brought about his downfall in 2014, then president Blaise Compaore kept up negotiations with Islamist forces, assuming a role of regional mediator.\n\n\u201cBurkina was their sanctuary,\u201d said a source in the security forces.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, he (Compaore) feared a coup. Though he was a soldier, he pared down the army in favour of his presidential guard. In 2014, we had an army without arms.\u201d\n\nShaken by foiled comeback attempts by Compaore loyalists, interim authorities and then the government of President Marc Roch Christian Kabore, elected in November 2015, have done little to boost security forces.\n\n\u201cI have an automatic pistol. I have five rounds of ammo. Is this how we\u2019re going to fight the jihadists?\u201d the police officer asked, adding that soldiers were no better off.\n\n\u201cSecurity guards transporting money have more ammunition than soldiers,\u201d a security source told AFP.\n\n\u201cNormally, when we go on a mission we are entitled to 500 CFA francs (0.75 euros / $0.84) each morning, 500 at midday and 500 for the evening. In practice, we get nothing,\u201d said the policeman, who often got his water and rations from French soldiers at Djibo.\n\n\u201cSenior offices stay in Ouaga, the subalterns stay in big towns. There\u2019s a problem with the chain of command, discipline and involvement. The Koutougou episode sums that up,\u201d said the security source.\n\nOn August 19, the army faced the most deadly assault in its history in the northern town, where 24 soldiers were killed.\n\nThe senior-most soldier at Koutougou was a non-commissioned officer, several sources said. The unit informed their superiors that jihadists were gathering to attack, but no help came.\n\nLast month, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) unveiled a plan to raise $1 billion (911 million euros) for the fight, but is counting on wealthy nations to fill the coffers.\n\nFrance has sent 200 special forces to Ouagadougou, among 4,500 troops deployed in the Sahel nations with a mission to combat terrorism and insurgency.", "description": "Ouagadougou (AFP) \u2013 The expert cups his hands, with the ball-like space between them representing Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso.
