On Tuesday, a group of 72 female MPs, the great majority of them Labour, issued an open letter of solidarity with a leading member of the Royal Family.\n\nIn normal circumstances, no one would be more delighted than me, since the signatories include hard-Left Labour frontbenchers such as Diane Abbott and Angela Rayner. Not the sort of people you would expect to have a picture of the Queen hanging on their wall.\n\nBut it turns out the letter is not a welcome airing of monarchist sentiment from women who might not usually be the first to jump to the aid of a member of the Royal Family.\n\nNo, it is an expression of support for the Duchess of Sussex. The MPs assert that some very beastly things have been done to her by the wicked Press.\n\nThe letter, addressed to Meghan Markle (above) claimed that the MPs stood with her on her stance against the media\n\nThe letter was sent by Holly Lynch and claimed that the MPs 'shared an understanding' with the Duchess\n\nFor example, newspapers have \u2018cast aspersions on her character\u2019 and published \u2018distasteful and misleading\u2019 stories \u2018concerning you [that\u2019s Meghan], your character and your family\u2019.\n\nUnfortunately, in what is admittedly a short letter whose leading signatory is the Labour MP Holly Lynch, not a single instance of the media\u2019s alleged persecution of the Duchess is produced.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it have been helpful if the missive had at least hinted at what is meant by the charge that newspapers are \u2018seeking to tear down a woman for no apparent reason\u2019?\n\nIf only one illustration of what sounds like bullying bordering on intimidation had been cited, we would at least have the basis for a sensible debate. But nothing whatsoever is offered.\n\nThe letter was spearheaded by Halifax MP Holly Lynch (pictured above) who said the MPs would 'stand with' the Duchess\n\nThis did not prevent Meghan from telephoning Ms Lynch yesterday to thank her for her support. According to the MP, she was \u2018pleased to have seen that letter\u2019.\n\nThere is one wild and unsubstantiated accusation in it which tops all the others. It is that \u2018some of these stories\u2019 \u2014 naturally, no examples are given \u2014 have \u2018outdated, colonial undertones\u2019.\n\nIs this a suggestion that there is an element of anti-Americanism in the supposed hounding of Meghan by the vicious media? After all, the country of her birth, the United States, was once a colony.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, I suppose, but I think the MPs are getting at something else. They are implying, without quite daring to say as much, that news-papers\u2019 criticisms of the Duchess of Sussex are partly motivated by racism.\n\nOf all the smears in this ill-conceived epistle of nonsense, this is easily the most outrageous \u2014 and also potentially the most damaging. What could lower the Press more in public esteem than the insinuation that it has a secret racist agenda against Meghan?\n\nIt\u2019s rot. And dangerous, politically driven rot at that. I have read countless articles about the Duchess in the mainstream media, and I haven\u2019t come across a single example of anything remotely resembling racism in the faintest sense.\n\nIf the MPs can dig up one shred of evidence to support their disgraceful innuendo, they should produce it forthwith. But, of course, they can\u2019t \u2014 because it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nWhat they would very probably do, if forced to defend their idiocy, is to say that while there are no instances of racism to be found in Press coverage, it nonetheless underlies all the criticisms that are made of Meghan.\n\nIn other words, if newspapers grumble about the hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on Meghan\u2019s six-day \u2018baby shower\u2019 trip to New York earlier in the year (flying there and back by private jet), that is a clear case of racism.\n\nWhen some in the media express surprise that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should conceal the names of the godparents of Archie, who is seventh in line to the throne, that is another appalling manifestation of racism.\n\nBoth Meghan and Harry (above) have been critised for their actions - especially concealing Archie's god parents\n\nAnd if columnists harrumphed after Harry delivered a lecture about the perils of global warming before he and Meghan took four journeys by private jet in 11 days, it was, of course, another expression of sublimated racism.\n\nCould anything be madder? Harry and Meghan are immensely privileged people in receipt of considerable public funds. For example, their home, Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, was refurbished at a cost of more than \u00a32.4 million of taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nBut it would appear that whatever inconsistencies the Duke and Duchess may display, the Press is enjoined to stay schtum for fear of being accused of the worst form of bigotry.\n\nSuch is the debased level of public debate in modern Britain. We are not talking about louts name-calling on a street corner but Members of Parliament (four of them in the Shadow Cabinet) who might be expected to show discrimination, intelligence and discernment.\n\nLet me add that I wish Harry himself would supply chapter and verse when lashing newspapers. He recently accused them of running \u2018knowingly false and malicious stories\u2019 and other such excesses without offering a single example. But he hasn\u2019t \u2014 at least, not yet \u2014 accused them of racism.\n\nSo what we have here are insidious and baseless accusations circulated by a group of female MPs. I don\u2019t doubt that there is at least a smidgen of sisterly affection for the Duchess.\n\nJeremy Corbyn (pictured above) is thought to want to bring newspapers under a measure state control\n\nBut the deeper motivation behind the letter is, of course, political. As I say, most signatories are Labour. And it is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s intention to bring newspapers under a measure of state control.\n\nAlthough details have not yet been revealed, the Labour leader spoke four years ago of the need for a \u2018multiplicity of ownership\u2019 in the Press. That might imply confiscation.\n\nLast year he warned news-papers that \u2018change is coming\u2019. A Labour administration could set in train a second Leveson Inquiry into newspapers. He has questioned Press freedom by claiming titles are \u2018controlled by billionaire tax exiles\u2019.\n\nThe motives of many of the signatories of Holly Lynch\u2019s letter should be partly interpreted in this light. If the Press is to be curbed, it is necessary to demonstrate that it has overstepped the bounds of decency and ignored people\u2019s privacy.\n\nBut, as I\u2019ve argued, the women MPs have shown no such thing. They have made charges without foundation \u2014 without, indeed, bothering to adduce any evidence at all. Their cunning purpose is to disseminate the idea that newspapers are not to be trusted, and so should be regulated.\n\nHow a handful of female Tory MPs could have been caught up in such a devious plot is bewildering, though it seems that some were astute enough to smell a rat, and refused to sign.\n\nIt is even more regrettable that Meghan should have thanked Holly Lynch for her support. She has done what no member of the Royal Family should ever do by entering the political arena \u2014 whether deliberately or inadvertently I can\u2019t say \u2014 and given comfort to the enemies of a free Press.\n\nPrince Harry is taking legal action against two national newspapers, and Meghan is suing the Daily Mail\u2019s sister paper, the Mail on Sunday. The rights and wrongs of these cases need not concern us here.\n\nWhat should concern us, though, is the possibility that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex might foolishly broaden their battle with the Press and line up with Labour MPs intent on undermining its freedoms.", "description": "STEPHEN GLOVER: On Tuesday, a group of 72 female MPs, the great majority of them Labour, issued an open letter of solidarity with Meghan Markle (pictured).", "authors": ["Stephen Glover For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/21/20343930-0-image-a-2_1572472285611.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
