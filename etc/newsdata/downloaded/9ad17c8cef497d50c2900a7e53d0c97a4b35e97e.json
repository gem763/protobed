Here's why", "language": "en", "text": "Imagine you\u2019re a struggling high school student. Maybe your parents have recently divorced or a love interest has just broken your heart. Worse yet, someone you care about has been given a terminal diagnosis.\n\nYou\u2019re flailing in the classroom, desperate to find your place on campus.\n\nThere are hundreds of kids around you, but somehow you feel all alone.\n\nKENTUCKY SCHOOL REMOVES 'PRAYER LOCKER' AFTER ANTI-RELIGION GROUP COMPLAINS\n\nIt\u2019s between classes and you\u2019re walking past a row of metal lockers, each one just the same as the next. Your head is down and so are your spirits.\n\nBut then you suddenly see a sign \u2013 literally and figuratively \u2013 on one of the locker doors.\n\nThe white paper says \u201cprayer locker\u201d and invites you to anonymously and confidentially submit prayer requests on slips of paper. No questions will be asked and every petition is promised to be prayed for.\n\nThis exact scenario has been playing out in Pike County Schools in eastern Kentucky. Nobody seems to know how it began, though some suspect it was first organized by a teacher. What started in one school spread to others in the district.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\"It's really helped a lot of people throughout the year get through stuff, get their thoughts out,\" said East Ridge High School sophomore Joseph Slone. \"A lot of people that I know, they have troubles. They have family troubles; struggles that they need to get through.\"\n\nThose troubles were being praying for until the Americans United for Separation of Church and State stepped in, claiming the \u201cprayer locker\u201d somehow violated the First Amendment.\n\nIn response, Pike County School Board Superintendent Reed Adkins stood down, ordering the prayer lockers removed.\n\nRadical groups including Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation have perfected the art of bullying by trading in specious arguments revolving around the legality of faith expression in public places like schools and other government institutions.\n\nThey use the threat of a lawsuit and court like a club. Rather than fight it, many groups buckle to the leftist bullies.\n\nLost in the debate is good old common sense, something that seems to be in increasingly short supply these days.\n\nSuggesting that the procurement of an unused locker for the collection of prayer requests somehow constitutes the endorsement of a state-sponsored religion is absurdity to the extreme.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about mandatory, formal, school-led prayer over a loudspeaker. We\u2019re talking about taking anonymous prayer requests on small slips of paper. Participate or not. It\u2019s the student\u2019s choice.\n\nAt a time when violence in schools is growing and children find themselves navigating a myriad of complex personal problems, prayer is a powerful mechanism that not only brings comfort and help to those who request it \u2013 prayer also profoundly changes those who pray.\n\n\u201cGod shapes the world by prayer,\u201d wrote the late Mother Teresa. \u201cThe more praying there is in the world the better the world will be, the mightier the forces against evil.\u201d\n\nA friend of mine recently observed, \u201cAs the mother of a teen, I know that kids in school could use a prayer \u2013 or two.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always been perplexed by the energy behind the agitators who want to curtail a person\u2019s freedom of private religious expression, especially their right to pray silently. In many ways, I feel sorry for them because it\u2019s obvious they\u2019ve never been warmed or overwhelmed by the power of answered prayer.\n\nIn my own life, I have seen miracles follow prayer \u2013 some instantly. I\u2019ve seen prayer radically change hearts, deliver people from addictions, heal hurts and illnesses \u2013 and help lifelong hopes and dreams come true.\n\nWhy would any reasonable person want to withhold that blessing from someone else, especially vulnerable young people?\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling today, and you\u2019re a person of faith, I would encourage you to bring your concerns directly to God. Don\u2019t worry about your choice of words. Talk to Him like a child talks to a parent.\n\nBut petitionary prayer, which is at the center of the locker controversy, is a wonderful magnifier and a multiplier. So go ahead and don\u2019t be shy about asking others to pray for you. Many would consider it a privilege, including me.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPrayer gives perspective. Prayer provides hope. Prayer is the comforting balm that the burns of the world desperately need right now.\n\nPray to be blessed. Pray to be a blessing. If you ask me, that\u2019s a winning combination.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL BATURA", "description": "Pray to be blessed. Pray to be a blessing.
