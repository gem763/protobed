But I ended up staying. And, as I mentioned, I will give my best.\n\n'I will give 100 per cent on the pitch and try to bring victories to Paris, especially in the Champions League.'\n\nNeymar (left) denied a rift with Kylian Mbappe (right) and described him as an 'incredible kid'\n\nSome have questioned the relationship with Kylian Mbappe as the duo were reported to have clashed last season.\n\nOn the subject, Neymar added: 'With Kylian it\u2019s different. He speaks French, he\u2019s French, and I\u2019m Brazilian. We get on very well. He\u2019s an incredible kid. Not to mention his football, which is amazing.'\n\nIt wasn't just Neymar's relationship with Mbappe that was called into question as large sections of PSG fans reacted angrily at what they deemed as public disrespect and betrayal.\n\nHis appearances for Thomas Tuchel's side have been met with whistles since but he believes the tension is cooling off now.\n\nThe forward is out of action for the next four weeks with a hamstring injury\n\nNeymar continued: 'Soon the love will return, God willing. It is normal, I understand their feelings too.\n\n'I can try to understand what goes on in their minds but I ask them to understand me too.\n\n'I compared it to a relationship between a man and a woman. You always end up fighting and it is part of any relationship. Later you make peace and the love returns.'\n\nThe 27-year-old has been plagued by injury problems in recent months and is currently sidelined for four weeks with a strained hamstring.", "description": "Neymar has confirmed that he wanted to leave PSG in the summer and was not happy at the French club.\u00a0He has pledged to do his best while he remains in Paris.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20032016-0-image-a-13_1571743461033.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
