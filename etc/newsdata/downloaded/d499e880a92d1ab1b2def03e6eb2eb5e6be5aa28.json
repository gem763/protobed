(Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nFrom the White House lawn on Sunday, President Trump promised a package of laws to address the scourge of gun violence.\n\nBut in advertisements that went up Monday on Facebook, the president delivered a very different message, pointedly warning a select group of voters that Democrats were intent on repealing the Second Amendment and asking them to sign their names to a petition to defend gun rights.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have finally admitted what they truly want: a repeal of the Second Amendment,\u201d reads one variation of the ad, which went up two days after a shooting attack Saturday in two Texas towns left seven dead and 22 wounded. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the American people to stand strong and defend our freedoms.\u201d\n\nThe appeal went out as a Trump surrogate \u2014 a member of his 2020 advisory board \u2014 promoted a conspiracy theory on Twitter falsely tying the Saturday gunman to Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman and presidential candidate.\n\nThe Facebook blitz, which relies on misleading claims about Democratic objectives, offers a window into Trump\u2019s mixed messaging on guns in the wake of a pair of mass shootings in early August \u2014 in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio \u2014 that marked the nadir of a bloody month in which more than 50 people were killed in mass gun attacks.\n\nIn the days after the El Paso shooting, Trump signaled he was open to proposals for new background checks, saying that \u201cthere is a great appetite\u201d for such measures. Soon after, following a phone call with National Rifle Association head Wayne LaPierre, the president changed his tune, echoing the messaging of the NRA.\n\nLast weekend, Trump again embraced the NRA\u2019s talking points, asserting that background checks would \u201cnot have stopped any of it.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re doing a package, and we\u2019ll see how it comes about.\u201d Mum on details, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a lot of different bills, ideas, concepts.\"\n\nThe ads illuminate how targeting techniques offered by Facebook and other platforms allow Trump to sound one note from the White House lawn and a different note to a handpicked group of Internet dwellers. The base gets one message; everyone else gets another.\n\nSome versions include a video with foreboding music and a promise that \u201cYour Second Amendment will NEVER BE REPEALED.\u201d An invitation to sign what the ads bill as the \u201cOfficial Defend the Second Amendment Petition\u201d flashes in red. Users who comply are asked to enter their names, email addresses and Zip codes, with the option to add a mobile number.\n\nThe ads, sponsored by Trump\u2019s official Facebook page, were paid for by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint national fundraising committee run by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\n\u201cThe messaging [of the ads] is straight from the NRA playbook, painted in as dire and apocalyptic terms as they can muster,\u201d said Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York at Cortland. \u201cTo the extent that he\u2019s been oscillating back and forth and making sympathetic noise about a number of different proposals, this abandons all of that.\u201d\n\nThe ads were targeted at users across a broad swath of the country but appeared to be concentrated in certain left-leaning states with a sizable population of gun owners, such as Oregon and Washington, as well as a handful of Midwestern states, including Michigan and Ohio.\n\nOne version appears only to men between the ages of 45 and 54 in Louisiana, which is exceptionally specific, said Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering who studies advertising on social media. She speculated that it was an attempt to collect personal identifying information from attendees of a single event, such as a gun show.\n\nSpitzer said the ads amounted to a \u201crallying cry for the gun base,\u201d delivered two days after a deadly shooting and as prominent Democrats pressed the case for gun control. That environment provides fertile ground for dire warnings about the Second Amendment, he said, because of anxiety that spikes about lawmakers reining in access to firearms.\n\n[On Labor Day, presidential candidates turn the conversation to guns]\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request about the timing of the ads and whether they were specifically tied to fresh calls for gun control after the shooting in West Texas. Also unanswered was a question about the accuracy of saying Democrats want to repeal the Second Amendment, which is not a pathway publicly favored by any Democratic presidential aspirants or member of Congress.\n\nReexamining the Second Amendment has gained currency among a small group of state lawmakers and candidates for federal office. Hawaii Democrats introduced a measure in March urging Congress \u201cto clarify the constitutional right to bear arms.\u201d And Shannon Liss-Riordan, who is challenging Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts in the Democratic primary, last month said it was \u201ctime we take real action and repeal the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nJohn Paul Stevens, a Republican who served on the Supreme Court for 35 years, in March made the case for the Second Amendment\u2019s repeal in a New York Times op-ed. (Stevens died in July.)\n\nFacebook did not return a request for comment about whether the characterization of Democratic priorities violates its policy against \u201cdeceptive, false, or misleading content.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign has spent massively on Facebook in recent months, including about $5 million since the start of June, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic communications agency. But it has not been a top Facebook spender on ads related to guns and gun control. Among top-tier Democratic presidential candidates, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was alone in putting out new ads about gun control after the weekend violence.\n\nOther groups that have come out with fresh gun-related ads on Facebook after Saturday\u2019s shooting included Washington Gun Law, an advocacy group that promises to \u201ckeep you apprised of all relevant legal issues involving firearms and self-defense in Washington state,\u201d and U.S. & Texas LawShield, a legal-defense organization.\n\nSocial media was awash in misinformation about guns and gun control after Saturday\u2019s shooting, which unfolded in Odessa and Midland.\n\nMuch of the false messaging targeted O\u2019Rourke, who has called for mandatory buybacks of assault weapons, among other measures to curb the violence that has convulsed scores of American cities, including his hometown of El Paso.\n\nAnthony Shaffer, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and a member of Trump\u2019s 2020 advisory board, on Monday promoted a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that the gunman in West Texas was an O\u2019Rourke supporter, with a sticker on his truck supporting the candidate \u2014 claims for which there is no evidence, authorities confirmed.\n\nShaffer, who has promoted baseless claims about the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and clashed with the U.S. military and intelligence communities over his allegations of an intelligence failure before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, took to Twitter after the shooting to assail Democrats for calling for new restrictions on firearms. In one post, he said the gunman was a supporter of O\u2019Rourke, tagging the Democrat, and retweeting a post from an account with the handle @suemo54 and the name \u201cSue Moore.\u201d\n\nThe original tweet, posted Sunday, read: \u201cThe Odessa Shooter\u2019s name is Seth Ator, a Democrat Socialist who had a Beto sticker on his truck.\u201d It had garnered more than 10,000 retweets by early Tuesday, despite being previously flagged to Twitter.\n\nOscar Villarreal, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said there was no indication the gunman was linked to O\u2019Rourke in any way. Nir Hauser, a co-founder of a firm called VineSight, which uses artificial intelligence to track misinformation, said the post appears to have been amplified mainly by bot accounts.\n\nShaffer, in a brief interview Tuesday morning, stood by his tweet, saying \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019ve seen from people\u201d when informed that his claim about the gunman had no basis in fact.\n\nHe declined to answer questions about his work on Trump\u2019s advisory board, saying only that it was an unpaid role that he has fulfilled \u201csince the time they went into office.\u201d In April, Shaffer was interviewed by Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, on the Donald J. Trump Podcast.\n\nResponding to an inquiry about Shaffer\u2019s role on the advisory board, the Trump campaign said: \u201cThe Trump 2020 Advisory Board is a diverse group of key supporters committed to reelecting President Donald Trump. Advisory Board members often serve as surrogates in media appearances or by writing op-eds.\u201d\n\nThe account that appears to have hatched the conspiracy theory about O\u2019Rourke, drawing Shaffer\u2019s attention, identifies its owner as a 72-year-old retiree living in Mesa, Ariz. A message left on a linked Facebook page went unanswered Tuesday.", "description": "The Facebook blitz unfolded as a self-described member of the president's 2020 advisory board promoted a conspiracy theory about the gunman in West Texas.", "authors": ["Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AJCCY3iytGowuuNgpRdgEmsdUb8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MYMINXFZJQI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg"}
