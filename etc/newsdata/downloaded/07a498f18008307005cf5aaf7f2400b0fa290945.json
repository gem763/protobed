But, as it turns out, just because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t out to get you.\n\nFollowing the Heritage Foundation event, as we policy wonks debated how to bridge Africa\u2019s infrastructure gap, the impact of China\u2019s state-directed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the sustainability of Chinese debt, and the role that the newly-constituted Development Finance Corporation (DFC) could play in executing the U.S. policy \u201cProsper Africa,\u201d the Russian government and its proxies were on the move, and \u2014 as usual \u2014 playing by their own rules, without accountability.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn May 19, a white paper presented to the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon warned that the United States was ill-equipped to counter the increasingly brazen political warfare Russia is waging to undermine democracies.\n\n\"In this environment, economic competition, influence campaigns, paramilitary actions, cyber intrusions, and political warfare will likely become more prevalent,\" writes Navy Rear Adm. Jeffrey Czerewko, the Joint Chiefs' deputy director for global operations, in the preface.\n\nOne month later, leaked documents obtained by the Dossier Center, a London-based investigative organization funded by exiled Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, revealed Russia\u2019s plan to use proxies to bolster its presence in at least 13 African nations by building relations with existing rulers, striking military deals, and grooming a new generation of leaders and undercover agents. It included a map that rates the level of cooperation with individual African countries, scoring them between one and five points on matters of cooperation.\n\nThe documents, first exposed by London\u2019s Guardian newspaper but since reviewed and analyzed by the New York Times, South Africa\u2019s Daily Maverick and the Times of London, reveal that the mission to increase Russian influence in Africa is being led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman nicknamed \u201cPutin\u2019s Chef\u201d because of the lucrative Kremlin catering contracts he holds.\n\nPrigozhin was indicted in 2018 by Special Counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE for using his catering business in St. Petersburg, Russia, as a front to run a troll factory with the purpose of interfering in the United States\u2019 2016 presidential elections in support of Donald Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' US moves British ISIS suspects from Syria amid Turkish invasion MORE, and just last week the U.S. Department of Treasury, seeking to \u201csafeguard our democratic processes from adversaries\u201d imposed additional sanctions on Prigozhin, targeting his physical assets, including three aircraft and a yacht as well as employees of the Internet Research Agency \u2014 the alleged residents of the troll factory.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Dossier Center investigation uncovers multiple firms linked to the oligarch, all of which are reported to operate \u201cin coordination with officials inside Russia\u2019s foreign and defense ministries,\u201d including the Wagner Group, which first gained attention for its operations in 2014 in Ukraine where it provided mercenaries to fight alongside the Russian-backed separatists. Since 2014, the group has been seen in Syria, Libya and the Central Africa Republic (CAR).\n\nAccording to Dionne Searcey of the New York Times, after meddling in the U.S. elections in 2016, Russia is using similar tactics in CAR; but as it sows political chaos, this time there are also diamonds. \u201cAs the United States as pulled away from engaging Africa, withdrawing troops and offering no broad policy agenda, Russia has pushed hard into the continent expanding its presence in unstable nations with abundant resources,\u201d Searcey writes.\n\nIn July of 2018, three Russian journalists who arrived in CAR to investigate Russia\u2019s military activities in the country and document the work of the Wagner Group were led into an ambush and murdered. It is widely believed to have been a hit job \u2014 Russians playing by their own rules in weak nations without institutional checks and balances.\n\nPrigozhin\u2019s company and other Russian proxies reportedly have been involved in Madagascar and South Africa\u2019s last presidential election, and with deposed Sundanese dictator Omar Al-Bashir, for whom Russian specialists reportedly drew up a program for the besieged leader that included a campaign to smear anti-government protesters.\n\nThis brings me back to our missing mustachioed-man, John Bolton, the concerns he expressed in December of last year, and what appears to be a lack of political urgency in the U.S. administration (outside of the Department of Treasury) to do anything about the creeping criminal hand of Russia in Africa. Left unchecked, the Russian program could undermine the most important democratic development on the continent in the past two decades: The rise of Africa\u2019s activist generation.\n\n\u201cWestern countries need to play catch-up to Russia (as well as China) in actually delivering a strategy and the tools,\u201d argues Greg Mills of the Brenthurst Foundation. Mills, like others, believes that the United States relies too heavily on \u201climped-wristed\u201d election observation missions that are easily manipulated.\n\nIn a paper entitled, \u201cThe Game has Changed,\u201d Judd Devermont, the director of the Africa Program the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has given us a blueprint for addressing Russia\u2019s destabilizing of norms in Africa and for carrying America\u2019s democratic brand to a population that embraces it.\n\nDevermont identifies essential interventions with an emphasis on credible nation-wide polling to fight fake news, new technologies, and, most importantly, the strengthening of Africa\u2019s civil society. The CSIS report should be a must read for the new Assistant to the President for African Affairs, Elizabeth Erin Walsh, who was appointed by Bolton and undoubtedly shares his concern about Russia\u2019s predatory practices. Likewise, it should be a must read for members of Congress (bicameral and bipartisan) who are united in the belief that Russian interference in politics at home and abroad cannot be tolerated.\n\nMeanwhile, as the continent\u2019s leaders convene for the first Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi in late October and await Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinCheney says Congress 'must and will' act after Turkey launches 'sickening' offensive in Syria Hillicon Valley: Senate Intel report urges action to prevent 2020 Russian meddling | Republicans warn Microsoft of 'urgent' Huawei threat | Court rules FBI surveillance violated Americans' rights Budowsky: Biden and Warren at POTUS Rubicon MORE\u2019s public relations offensive, they should do so with eyes wide open.\n\nK.
