Meat is becoming the next taboo,' the founder of The Wit database said.\n\n'The question they are asking is how can you cuddle your dog while you are putting another animal in the oven?\n\n'They have to treat this animal like a member of the family for three weeks.\n\n'Then in the end they have to decide whether they put it in the oven' or whether it goes to an animal sanctuary.\n\nChannel 4 said the three hour-long shows will confront 'the reality of an animal's journey from field to plate.'\n\nAnimals featured in the first few episodes, due to air on Channel 4, include a lamb, a pig, a chicken and a calf, with families having to look after one for three weeks (pictured, one of the families with their pet pig)\n\nThey said the show also seriously examines 'animal behaviour and intelligence, the farming practices required to meet the demands of hungry consumers... and the environmental impact of the meat industry.'\n\nDaniela Neumann, head of the makers Spun Gold, defended the premise, saying it was taking on 'some really timely themes of ethical eating' and well as asking difficult questions.\n\n'Why do we find it acceptable to eat a lamb but we wouldn't eat our pet dog? Could you go back to meat once you've put a name and face to a meal?'\n\nShe insisted the series also contained some 'heart-warming moments'.\n\nNicola Brown, Commissioning Editor, Specialist Factual at Channel 4, added: 'From environmental activism to vegan sausage rolls the debate around eating meat and animal welfare is more prominent than ever before.\n\n'Confronting the reality of an animal's journey from field to plate, Meat the Family will be a life changing and emotional experiment for all involved.'", "description": "Meat the Family, due to air on Channel 4, will ask four heavy meat-eating families to take home and look after an 'animal which ends up most often on their plates'.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/19/19754928-0-image-a-5_1571164404030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
