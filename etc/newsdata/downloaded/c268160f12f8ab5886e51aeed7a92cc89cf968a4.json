(Photo: Joe Kohen / Stringer, Getty Images)\n\nI mean, the man churns out books that are then transformed into TV and movie adaptations in the time it takes most of us to get out of bed in the mornings. If you\u2019re gonna go to a writer\u2019s retreat? This is the one to go to.\n\nRolling Stone reports that yesterday evening, the Bangor City Council approved a request from Stephen and Tabitha King to turn their abode in the Maine city into a non-profit.\n\nThe couple do not regularly frequent the house, so it will now serve as both an archive of King\u2019s vast library of works \u2014 that can be visited on an appointment basis, rather than as a touristy museum that would disrupt Bangor\u2019s local community \u2014 and as a writer\u2019s retreat for up to five creatives at a time looking to get their juices flowing in perhaps the most extra way possible.\n\nExtra, yes, but also great, because come on. LOOK AT THIS PLACE:\n\nThis is a place to write in. Sure, you\u2019re probably not going to bump into King himself while you\u2019re there. But to be surrounded by his works, to be in that atmosphere? It\u2019s either the perfect way to get your thinking cap on and craft what I believe are officially designated in the literary community as Good Words, or, frankly it\u2019s the premise of the next live-action King adaptation that has inevitably already been confirmed. Five writers trapped in the absolutely, 100 per cent haunted mansion of STEPHEN AND TABITHA KING?\n\nWe\u2019d watch that. Add it to the list!", "description": "I mean, the man churns out books that are then transformed into TV and movie adaptations in the time it takes most of us to get out of bed in the mornings.
