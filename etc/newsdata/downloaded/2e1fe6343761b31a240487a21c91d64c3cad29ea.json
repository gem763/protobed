The stakes here can\u2019t be understated: your smartphone is the most important gadget in your life, and you\u2019ll probably be living with the one you buy for at least a year, if not two or three.\n\nMost of the time, there\u2019s a phone that stands out from the pack in all the areas that matter: performance, value, camera, and support. And most of the time, that\u2019s usually the most expensive phone on the market. But as it turns out, you don\u2019t have to buy the priciest phone to get the best experience.\n\nThis guide focuses on the best phones on the market, also known as the premium tier. If you\u2019re looking for something even lower cost than these picks, please check out our guide to budget smartphones.\n\nThis article was updated on June 14th, 2019.\n\nThe best phone for most people: Apple iPhone XR\n\nApple has three current phones to choose from, each with different characteristics and prices. The one that most people should buy is actually the least expensive of the three: the iPhone XR.\n\nThe XR has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same second-generation Face ID system, the same front camera, and the same main rear camera as the pricier XS and XS Max, but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it has the best battery life of the three and comes in five different colors.\n\nThe most controversial thing about the XR is its display. At 6.1 inches, it sits in between the smaller XS and the larger XS Max, but the main difference is that it\u2019s an LCD instead of an OLED. That means the borders around the screen are slightly larger, the blacks aren\u2019t as deep, and the colors aren\u2019t as vibrant as the pricier displays. But unless you put the XR next to a XS or XS Max, you\u2019re not likely to ever notice those things. The other thing you\u2019ll never notice is the fact that the XR screen has a lower resolution than the others, because it\u2019s still sharp enough that you can\u2019t see individual pixels with your naked eye. Overall, it\u2019s a very good display that the vast majority of people will be thrilled with.\n\nThe XR also gives up the telephoto camera that\u2019s available on the XS and XS Max, but that\u2019s something most people won\u2019t miss. The telephoto camera on those phones is inferior to the main camera and since the XR still has a portrait mode feature available, most people won\u2019t miss it.\n\nSince the XR has Apple\u2019s latest smartphone processor, the A12 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. Its large screen lets you see a lot of content at once and the faster Face ID system is better and more reliable than it was on last year\u2019s iPhone X. But the thing that really sells the XR, aside from its price, is its stellar battery life. That lower-resolution display helps the XR power through a whole day much more confidently than either of the XS models. The two things that most people want from a new phone are better battery life and a bigger screen, and if you\u2019re upgrading from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8 device, the XR delivers on both fronts.\n\nThe biggest knock you can make against the XR is that, well, it\u2019s not a very exciting phone. Even with a choice of six different color options, the XR is still the most utilitarian-feeling phone in Apple\u2019s lineup. If you\u2019re the type of person who gets excited about phones and wants the absolute best thing Apple has to offer, then you should probably pony up for a XS or XS Max. But the rest of us who just want a reliable, fast, long-lasting phone with an excellent camera will be very happy with the XR.\n\nThe base XR comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it\u2019s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model. This is another advantage the XR has over the XS models \u2014 if you want to get more storage with those phones, you have to jump up to a 256GB model that costs more than the 128GB upgrade on the XR.\n\nIn all, the iPhone XR is perhaps the most impressive iPhone in years: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing stellar battery life for less money than other options on the market.\n\nOur review of Apple iPhone XR Verge Score 8 out of 10 Buy for $599.00 from Apple\n\nThe best Android phone to buy: OnePlus 7 Pro\n\nLast year we named the OnePlus 6T as the best Android phone to buy, and this year OnePlus is taking it again with the OnePlus 7 Pro. The 7 Pro combines eye-catching design with blistering performance, a unique, super-smooth display, and a versatile camera system. And like the 6T before it, the 7 Pro offers all of this for hundreds of dollars less than the competition.\n\nThe 7 Pro is a significant upgrade over the 6T, however, thanks in large part to its new 6.7-inch, 90Hz display. It\u2019s a big, bright, pixel-dense OLED panel with a high refresh rate that makes scrolling through apps or text buttery smooth. It also doesn\u2019t have any notch or hole-punch cutout, even though it has barely any bezels surrounding it. That\u2019s because OnePlus hid the front-facing camera in a pop-up module that actually rises up out of the phone\u2019s frame when you want to take a selfie.\n\nThe 7 Pro\u2019s highlights don\u2019t end there, either. It\u2019s perhaps the fastest Android phone on the market, thanks in part to that high-refresh screen, but also because it has a high-end processor and tons of RAM to work with. OnePlus\u2019 software is also very fast and easy to use.\n\nWhere the 7 Pro falls short are in unsurprising areas: its three-lens camera system provides a variety of different perspectives and focal lengths to use, but it ultimately doesn\u2019t take as good pictures as an iPhone, Google Pixel, or Samsung Galaxy S10. The 7 Pro also lacks any official water resistance rating and wireless charging, both of which are standard things on high-end phones at this point.\n\nThere have also been a number of reports of different issues with the 7 Pro\u2019s touchscreen since it launched, including some that we\u2019ve observed ourselves. OnePlus has been issuing software updates to the device to address many of the reported bugs, and we can confirm that the latest update at the time of this article\u2019s publishing does fix the \u201cphantom touch\u201d issue on our review units.\n\nOverall, unless you\u2019re extremely particular about your camera or a wireless charging devotee, the 7 Pro\u2019s speed, software, display, and price make it an easy winner.\n\nOkay cool, but I can\u2019t do a giant phone: Samsung Galaxy S10E\n\nThe one thing that might be an actual deal-breaker for some with the OnePlus 7 Pro is its size: it\u2019s a giant, heavy phone that can be very hard to handle, especially if you\u2019re the type of person to use your phone in one hand. Sadly, OnePlus doesn\u2019t make a smaller version of it, but the Samsung Galaxy S10E is an excellent phone with compact proportions.\n\nThe S10E has great performance, a reliably good camera system, and a size that\u2019s easy to manage, even if you have smaller hands. It has many of the same features as the more expensive (and larger) S10 and S10 Plus, such as wireless charging, IP68 water resistance, and even a headphone jack. The S10E is actually a little more expensive than the OnePlus 7 Pro at its regular price, but it\u2019s not hard to find it on sale, which makes it a much better value.\n\nWhat about the Google Pixel 3?\n\nMany Android fans will point to the Google Pixel line as the best option because it offers Google\u2019s take on software and provides access to the latest versions of Android before any other phone. The Pixel 3 and 3 XL also have an excellent camera system, which stands above everything else.\n\nBut the Pixel 3 has been fraught with performance issues and bugs since its launch, and it has last year\u2019s processor and a dated design. Even though you can now buy it at T-Mobile and Sprint in addition to Verizon, the OnePlus 7 Pro or Galaxy S10E provide a much better value and more modern experience than the Pixel 3 or 3 XL.\n\nOther contenders\n\nThe smartphone market is littered with many other good devices, and depending on your particular wants or budget, there might be better options out there. We don\u2019t consider any of them to be the best phone for most people, but they could be a better choice for you. Many of these phones have dropped in price since their launch, so depending on the deal, they may be more compelling than some of our main picks. But make sure you\u2019re getting a good deal before pulling the trigger.\n\nOur review of Apple iPhone XS Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Terrific display\n\nGreat speakers\n\nLong battery life Bad Stuff Very good but not great camera\n\nPortrait Mode is extremely hit or miss\n\nExpensive Buy for $999.00 from Apple\n\nOur review of Apple iPhone XS Max Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Terrific display\n\nGreat speakers\n\nLong battery life Bad Stuff Very good but not great camera\n\nPortrait Mode is extremely hit or miss\n\nExpensive\n\nIf you buy a XS Max, you might have to say \u201ciPhone XS Max\u201d out loud Buy for $1,099.00 from Apple\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy S10 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent display\n\nFast performance and good battery life\n\nVersatile camera system\n\nA headphone jack Bad Stuff New in-screen fingerprint scanner is slower and more finicky than older ones\n\nCamera performance is not as good as Pixel in low light\n\nSlow software update schedule Buy for $893.95 from Amazon Buy for $849.99 from Best Buy\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Gorgeous, vibrant, bright, big display\n\nFast performance\n\nTrue all-day battery life\n\nLots of storage, even in the base model Bad Stuff High price tag\n\nLarge, unwieldy size\n\nDuplicate apps and extra features that don\u2019t add much value Buy for $999.99 from Samsung Buy for $999.99 from Amazon\n\nOur review of OnePlus 7 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Good ergonomics for a large phone\n\nButtery-smooth performance\n\nPretty display\n\nStrong battery life Bad Stuff No wireless charging or waterproofing\n\nFaces tough competition from Google\u2019s Pixel 3A\n\nMirror finish is a fingerprint nightmare\n\nCamera bump is annoyingly prominent Buy for $634.00 from OnePlus\n\nOur review of LG V40 ThinQ Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Versatile camera system\n\nFast performance\n\nReliably strong battery life Bad Stuff All-glass design scratches easily\n\nCameras aren\u2019t as high-quality as competitors\n\nLG is still slow with software updates Buy for $949.90 from B&H Photo Buy for $979.99 from Verizon\n\nOur review of LG G8 ThinQ Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Comfortable to hold\n\nQuad DAC yields great sound quality\n\nFace Unlock is fast and easy\n\nImproved battery capacity Bad Stuff Piezoelectric earpiece replacement isn\u2019t loud enough\n\nMay not receive timely software updates\n\nHand ID and Air Motion are gimmicky and don\u2019t always work Buy for $649.99 from Best Buy Buy for $699.99 from B&H\n\nOur review of RED Hydrogen One Verge Score 3 out of 10 Good Stuff Unique design\n\nHuge, long-lasting battery\n\nTries something new Bad Stuff Holographic display is blurry and bad\n\nNo accessories yet for expansion pins\n\nPhone is huge and bulky\n\nLarge bezels around sub-par display\n\nLittle 3D content\n\nLast year\u2019s processor\n\nFalls far short of other $1,000+ phones Buy for $1,295.00 from Verizon", "description": "Your phone is the most important gadget in your life, so it\u2019s important to make the right choice.
