So can jobseekers improve their chances of getting a quality new gig by moving to a more promising area?\n\nVolusion, an ecommerce service company, analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data to score cities based on factors like year-over-year employment growth and median wage growth, median annual wage, annual average unemployment rate, labor force participation rate, percentage of full-time workers and mean usual hours worked.\n\nThe analysis found that wages have gone up nationally after a Great Recession slump that lasted until 2013.
