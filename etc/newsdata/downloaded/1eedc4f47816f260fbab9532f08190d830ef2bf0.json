He was flagged for targeting while hitting Lamb helmet-first and late two plays before Lamb weaved through Texas defenders on a flea-flicker pass on a 51-yard score.\n\nLamb had 10 catches for 171 yards, tip-toeing on the sideline to stay inbounds on the 27-yarder for his final TD. Hurts threw for 235 yards and had 131 more on the ground, including a punctuating 3-yard touchdown for a 34-20 lead late in the fourth quarter.\n\nNO. 1 ALABAMA 47, TEXAS A&M 28\n\nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) \u2014 Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns and Alabama's offense kept rolling in the Tide's first game at No. 1 this season.\n\nTagovailoa threw his first interception of the season but became Alabama's career passing touchdowns leader with his first one of the game, breaking his tie with A.J. McCarron. The junior now has 81 for his career and leads the nation with 27 on the season.\n\nAlabama (6-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) trailed briefly in its first game this season against a ranked opponent when Texas A&M scored a touchdown on its first possession.\n\nTagovailoa then engineered four consecutive scoring drives, which included three touchdown passes that all came on third down, and the Tide were on cruise control against the best pass defense they had faced so far this season. The only blemish was the interception thrown in the Texas A&M end zone late in the second quarter.\n\nKellen Mond passed for 264 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a score for the Aggies (3-3, 1-2).\n\nNO. 2 CLEMSON 45, FLORIDA STATE 14\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Trevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes, two to Justyn Ross, and No. 2 Clemson answered any lingering questions from its close call at North Carolina, winning its 21st straight game.\n\nClemson (4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) started 6-0 for a fifth straight year and beat the Seminoles (3-3, 2-2) for the fifth straight year.\n\nLawrence completed 17 of 25 passes for 170 yards, including 10- and 8-yard TD throws to Ross. Lawrence also ran for a touchdown, the 6-foot-6 sophomore extending his full body to get over the goal line.\n\nEtienne ran for 127 yards and caught one of Lawrence's scoring throws.\n\nFSU quarterbacks James Blackman and Alex Hornibrook both threw first-half interceptions and the Seminoles managed only 63 yards in the first half. Things didn't get better after halftime as Blackman threw another pick that went for Derion Kendrick's 38-yard return score.\n\nFlorida State star Cam Akers' struggles against the Tigers continued. He had gained just 47 total yards vs. Clemson the past two games and ended with 34 yards on nine carries here.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA 20, NO. 3 GEORGIA 17, 2OT\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Parker White's 23-yard field goal in the second overtime proved to be enough when Georgia's Rodrigo Blankenship was wide left on his attempt from 42 yards, giving South Carolina its first win over an AP Top 25 opponent since beating Georgia in 2014.\n\nBlankenship's second miss of the game sent South Carolina players charging onto the field to celebrate the upset.\n\nWhite missed a 33-yard attempt in the first overtime.\n\nGeorgia (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) suffered a big hit to its national championship hopes. The Bulldogs, favored by 24\u00bd points, could not overcome three interceptions and a lost fumble by Jake Fromm. The senior did not throw an interception in the Bulldogs' first five games.\n\nOn the second play of overtime, Fromm's pass glanced off the hands of receiver Tyler Simmons and was intercepted by Israel Mukuamu. White's miss from 33 yards kept the game alive for South Carolina (3-3, 2-2).\n\nFromm led Georgia on a tying 96-yard touchdown drive capped by his 6-yard scoring pass to Demetris Robertson with less than two minutes remaining in regulation.\n\nNO. 8 WISCONSIN 38, MICHIGAN STATE 0\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Jonathan Taylor rushed for two touchdowns and No. 8 Wisconsin's defense posted its fourth shutout of the season.\n\nThe Spartans' defense held Taylor to 80 yards on 26 carries, marking the first time this season the Heisman Trophy hopeful was held under 100.\n\nBut Michigan State was held to 149 yards, 30 rushing, and couldn't find any rhythm as the Badgers dominated time of possession 39:10 to 20:50.\n\nJack Coan completed his first seven passes for Wisconsin (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten) and finished 18 of 21 for 180 yards and a touchdown to win his eighth straight start since last season.\n\nThe Spartans (4-3, 2-2) lost back-to-back games against AP top-10 Big Ten opponents. Michigan State lost at then-No. 4 Ohio State 34-10 last week.\n\nBrian Lewerke was 7 of 16 for 53 yards and an interception and sacked twice before getting pulled in the fourth quarter for backup Rocky Lombardi.\n\nThe Badgers last had four shutouts in 1930, when they had five.\n\nNO. 16 MICHIGAN 45, ILLINOIS 25\n\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Hassan Haskins ran for 125 yards and a touchdown, Zach Charbonnet added 116 yards rushing, and No. 16 Michigan needed a late surge to put away Illinois.\n\nThe Wolverines (5-1, 3-1 Big Ten) built a 28-0 lead by halftime, but turnovers and ineffective offense helped the Illini (2-4, 0-3) cut the lead to 28-25 with 12:50 left. Dre Brown ran in from a yard out and then converted a 2-point conversion for the Illini.\n\nMichigan responded with a long drive capped by Shea Patterson's 5-yard touchdown pass to Donovan Peoples-Jones. Patterson ran for a score after Michigan forced a turnover at the Illini 1 to seal it for Michigan.\n\nMatt Robinson, starting for the injured quarterback Brandon Peters, a graduate transfer from Michigan, was 16 of 25 for 192 yards and one touchdown for Illinois. He also ran for a score.\n\nNO. 18 ARIZONA STATE 38, WASHINGTON STATE 34\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Jayden Daniels scored on a 17-yard scramble with 34 seconds left and threw three touchdown passes to ailing Brandon Aiyuk to lead No. 18 Arizona State in a comeback win.\n\nArizona State (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12) trailed by three after Blake Mazza made a 31-yard field goal with 2 1/2 minutes left. Taking over at their own 25-yard line, the Sun Devils moved quickly down the field behind Daniels' pinpoint passing.\n\nThe freshman capped the drive with his scramble, helicoptering off a defender into the end zone.\n\nDaniels threw for 363 yards on 26-of-36 passing. Aiyuk had seven catches for 196 yards despite an illness that kept him out for portions of the game.\n\nAnthony Gordon threw for 466 yards and three touchdowns, but Washington State (3-3, 0-3) was again let down by its defense.\n\nTEMPLE 30, NO. 23 MEMPHIS 28\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Anthony Russo threw two touchdown passes and Temple took advantage of four turnovers by No. 23 Memphis to pull the upset.\n\nBrady White passed for 355 yards and two scores for Memphis (5-1, 2-1 American), which fell behind 16-0 as the Owls (5-1, 2-0) turned the Tigers' mistakes into points. The Owls could have buried Memphis early, but the first three Memphis turnovers were turned into Will Mobley's three field goals.\n\nJager Gardner ran for a score and Isaiah Wright and Brandon Mack caught touchdown passes for Temple. Russo's 12-yard touchdown to Mack made it 30-21 with 12:48 left in the fourth.\n\nRusso threw for 224 yards on 20-for-33 passing.\n\nThe final decisive play came with some debate. Joey Magnifico seemed to make diving catch to convert a fourth-and-10 with 1:50 left, but the called overturned and ruled incomplete after video review.\n\nNO. 25 CINCINNATI 38, HOUSTON 23\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Desmond Ridder passed for 263 yards and three touchdowns and No. 25 Cincinnati held off Houston's late surge for its fourth straight win.\n\nThe Bearcats (5-1, 2-0 American Athletic Conference) used a 21-point first half to pull away early and Perry Young's late 2-yard interception return for a touchdown sealed the win.\n\nThe Cougars (2-4, 0-2) cut the lead to five with 9:09 left on Tune's 6-yard pass to Christian Trahan, but it wasn't enough to prevent Houston's first 0-2 start in conference play since joining the AAC.\n\nHouston's Clayton Tune finished 9 of 27 for 184 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball /and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
