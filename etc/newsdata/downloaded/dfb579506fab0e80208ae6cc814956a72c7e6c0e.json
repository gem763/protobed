Previous attempts have been ruled unconstitutional.\n\nLast week, 16 LGBT+ activists were arrested on suspicion of gay sex.\n\n\u201cIt is the policy of ministry of health that all patients should be able to seek medical treatment without fear of discrimination, violence, personal vengeance or retaliation,\u201d said Aceng.\n\nMukwaya is a licensed member of the UMDPC and sits on the board.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all healthcare providers and stakeholders to accord equal and appropriate treatment to all patients who present at the health facilities irrespective of their race, tribe and gender.\u201d\n\nAceng added: \u201cWe also strongly condemn assault and violence against any individual and appeal to the public to report any such incidents to the relevant authorities.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we request the public to report any medical related abuse to the ministry of health.\u201d\n\nAn inquiry into the incident is expected to last two weeks.\n\nIf found guilty, Mukwaya faces suspension from practice and the removal of his name from the register, or he could be asked to pay a fine.\n\nLuke Owoyesigire, deputy police spokesperson for Kampala Metropolitan, said Mukwaya faces assault charges after the victim filed a case with police.\n\nMukwaya has accused the woman of trespassing, which is being investigated by police.\n\nMinister condemns plans for Uganda\u2019s first LGBT centre as \u2018criminal act\u2019 Read more\n\nMembers of the LGBT community say they risk physical attacks in their daily life and routinely encounter harassment, as well as facing prejudice over work, housing and healthcare.\n\nThe 16 men arrested last week worked for the charity Let\u2019s Walk Uganda. They were initially taken into \u201cprotective custody\u201d after a crowd surrounded their office, shouting abuse, rights groups said.\n\nThe men were due back in court on Tuesday, but the hearing has been put back until 5 November.", "description": "Minister of health refers case to Uganda\u2019s medical council as assault on LGBT rights in Uganda intensifies", "authors": ["Samuel Okiror"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4450c0011d183737337d236c8b684650638e1a51/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c6d30acf28a4a8cfc368604db25d59e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
