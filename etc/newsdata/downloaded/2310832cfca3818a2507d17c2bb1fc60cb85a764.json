The House just passed a bill to change that.", "language": "en", "text": "Advocates say the PACT Act would fill crucial gaps in national law, which only bans animal fighting as well as the making and sharing of videos that show the kind of abuse the PACT Act would criminalize. All states have provisions against animal cruelty, said Humane Society of the United States President Kitty Block, but without a federal ban, it\u2019s hard to prosecute cases that span different jurisdictions or that occur in airports, military bases and other places under federal purview.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis really is something that should pass,\u201d Block told The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s not controversial. It\u2019s what the American people want.\u201d\n\nHolly Gann, director of federal affairs for the Animal Wellness Foundation, said in a statement that most people \u201care shocked\u201d that the law is not already on the books.\n\nThe bipartisan act, introduced by Reps. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) and Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), builds on a 2010 law that targets videos depicting animal cruelty, spurred by disgust over a gruesome genre of \u201ccrush\u201d videos often showing small critters stomped under a woman\u2019s shoe.\n\nBlock says videos capturing such torture needed to be addressed at the federal level because content shared online transcends state boundaries. But no national law targets the acts behind the films \u2014 despite previous congressional efforts with widespread support.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Senate has passed a companion bill to the PACT Act twice, making supporters optimistic that with the House version passed, the measure can sail into law. Advocates point to opposition from recently retired congressman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), a former House Judiciary Committee chairman, as blocking previous attempts to pass the bill in the House. The Post was unable to reach Goodlatte on Wednesday.\n\nThe Senate now needs to vote again on its version of the bill, which lists 38 sponsors. Jason Attermann, a spokesman for Deutch, told The Post that PACT Act backers do not anticipate any hang-ups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been the Senate\u2019s fault for this not happening,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe PACT Act has been cheered not only by animal welfare groups but by many members of law enforcement who want federal tools to \u2014 in Deutch\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cstop animal abusers who are likely to commit acts of violence against people.\u201d Leaders of groups such as the Fraternal Order of Police and the Major County Sheriffs of America have thrown their weight behind the proposed law.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd animal lovers everywhere know this is simply the right thing to do,\u201d Deutch said in a statement.\n\nThe legislation outlines exemptions for humane euthanasia; slaughter for food; recreational activities such as hunting, trapping and fishing; medical and scientific research; \u201cnormal veterinary, agricultural husbandry, or other animal management practice;\u201d and actions that are necessary \u201cto protect the life or property of a person.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. House just passed the #PACT Act, legislation that I introduced with my colleague @RepTedDeutch to criminalize animal abuse. This important piece of legislation would make animal cruelty a federal offense. Great news for my fellow animal lovers! pic.twitter.com/fK4qAppXnK \u2014 Rep.
