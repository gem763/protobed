REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir/File Photo\n\nIn a statement, the Lebanese millers\u2019 association urged officials to find a solution for dollars to be supplied at the official price \u201cso the owners of the mills can resume their work and import the country\u2019s wheat need\u201d.\n\nThe Lebanese pound has been pegged against the dollar at a level of 1,507.5 pounds for more than two decades. Dollars and pounds are legal tender in Lebanon.\n\nLebanese central bank governor Riad Salameh said on Monday that dollars are available and banks were meeting customer demand. The central bank had not received any official complaints about dollar availability, he said.\n\nDistributors of fuel, also complaining they are unable to secure their dollar needs at that price, went on strike last week, saying a lack of dollars at the official exchange rate was forcing them to pay more at money exchange houses.\n\nThe millers\u2019 association said it was determined to supply flour to bakeries at the official Lebanese pound price \u201cbut the problem is that converting Lebanese pounds to U.S. dollars has become very costly\u201d.\n\nThis had led millers to issue invoices in U.S. dollars \u201cto preserve operating capital and the continuation of our work\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe wheat reserve at the mills has fallen to a level that represents a danger, and this may expose the country to a supply crisis if the U.S. dollar problem is not resolved,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Lebanese economy has suffered from a slowdown in capital inflows from abroad that have long been used to finance the government budget and current account deficit.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s foreign assets, excluding gold, fell around 15% from an all-time high in May last year to $38.7 billion in mid-September.\n\nHassan Assaf, a member of the millers\u2019 association, said banks had been gradually curbing supply of dollars for two months. Wheat reserves held by private millers had fallen to 1-1/2 to two months of supply from four months, he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t place import requests because we cannot secure dollars to open credit lines,\u201d he said.\n\nPrices charged by money exchange houses for dollars had touched as high as 1,580 pounds, he said.", "description": "Lebanese millers said on Tuesday wheat stocks had fallen to a dangerous level, warning the country may face a supply crisis unless dollars needed to import the grain are supplied at the official rate, the National News Agency reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433397224&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1J7", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
