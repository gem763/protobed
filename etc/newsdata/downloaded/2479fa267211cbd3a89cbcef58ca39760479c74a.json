The European Parliament then added its support for that extension last week, with 544 MEPs voting in favour of it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

After all, the European Union still primarily functions as a club of member states.\n\nBut leaders of European institutions would do well to remember that Johnson leads an unstable minority government that could soon be ejected from power in a general election.\n\nA deal with Johnson is unlikely to succeed after Theresa May's failed. Nor will it limit the spread of populism that infects both British politics and that of other EU member states. A show of solidarity with pro-European Brits could pay dividends for other EU countries fighting similar battles, now and in future.\n\nEuropean leaders should avoid the temptation to capitulate now based on the assumption that will in any way end a seemingly interminable Brexit process. It will instead ensure that the next phase of the Brexit negotiations, on the future relationship, are fraught and protracted.\n\nThe only way now to ensure a close EU-UK partnership is for the EU to support cross-party efforts within the British Parliament to ensure we do not leave on chaotic, damaging terms.\n\nIf anything, those of us fighting to preserve the fundamental European value of liberal, parliamentary democracy should be the ones receiving support.\n\nThe European Commission chose to stay out of the referendum on the UK's European Union membership. Juncker has since said that decision was a mistake, and has even suggested that more EU involvement might have produced a different outcome. It would be perverse and unwise for him and others to involve themselves in British politics to help deliver a Brexit deal that has no mandate.\n\nSince opposition MPs in Britain have taken no deal off the table, it is hard to see why it is in the interests of the European Union to consider caving in to Boris Johnson's unrealistic, cherry-picking demands. First, this would undermine the founding principles of the EU. Secondly, Johnson\u2019s reckless approach risks destroying the integrity of the United Kingdom \u2013 an outcome which is clearly not in the long-term strategic interests of the European Union.\n\nMany of the colleagues I sit alongside in the European Parliament do not now see Brexit as inevitable. They understand that public opinion in the UK is shifting, evidenced by the election of 16 Liberal Democrat MEPs just a few months ago on a clear mandate to stop Brexit.\n\nA reversal of Brexit, whether by a People's Vote or a general election that installs a Liberal Democrat Government, ready to revoke Article 50 on day one, is within grasp. This is an opportunity for the European Union. Granting the UK more time is worth it when the potential end result is for Britain to come out of it as a sincere, committed member of the EU.\n\nAt the very least, the European Commission and EU capitals should give those of us who still believe in a shared European future a fighting chance. We haven't given up on Europe; Europe must not now give up on us.\n\nLuisa Porritt is the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European Parliament and MEP for London", "description": "It has been a shameful week in Westminster.
