Ted Lieu and Jamie Raskin, argue they\u2019re already conducting an impeachment inquiry \u2014 and have been doing so for a while now.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment proceedings have been under way, by which I mean the proceedings to determine if there should be articles of impeachment,\u201d Mr. Raskin, Maryland Democrat, said.\n\nMr. Hoyer later walked back his comments, issuing a statement saying he thought the question was whether the full House was considering articles of impeachment.\n\nOther members of leadership have avoided using the term impeachment altogether.\n\nReps. Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Caucus chairman, and Adam Schiff, House Intelligence chairman, both declined to say whether they consider the judiciary committee\u2019s work to be an impeachment investigation.\n\nAs a member on the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Jeffries gave his support for Mr. Nadler but said the committee would \u201cmake some determinations as to characterization\u201d on Thursday.\n\nMr. Schiff, whose own committee is investigating the president, said his focus is on how Democrats are doing in their legal battle to enforce their subpoenas.\n\n\u201cWhat matters most to me is do we meet the definition required to get grand jury information in court. I believe we do. That requires that we be in a judicial proceeding or preliminary to one,\u201d he said.\n\nMost notably, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has declined to use the phrase \u201cformal impeachment investigation.\u201d\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t explicitly shut down the talk, either.\n\nRather, she and her top lieutenants are focusing on the substance of the investigation and overall Democratic strategy, while dismissing confusion as a distracting argument over word choice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get caught in semantics,\u201d Mr. Jeffries told reporters. \u201cWe are charged with being a check and balance that includes oversight over the executive branch and the president. That\u2019s what six committees are doing, not simply the judiciary committee.\n\n\u201cThe committees should be allowed to do their work without getting caught up into semantical distinctions,\u201d he added.\n\nUltimately though, the quibbling over word choice has left parts of the caucus describing entirely different practices.\n\nRep. Harley Rouda, California Democrat, told The Washington Times Monday that he understood the committee was \u201cworking on a framework for an impeachment inquiry,\u201d despite Judiciary Democrats saying it was ongoing.\n\nRep. Lucille Royal-Allard, who endorsed an impeachment inquiry not long before the August break, told The Times she understood the committee was looking into whether to move forward on impeachment but felt describing it as \u201cformal\u201d impeachment proceedings was confusing.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that we will have a caucus and that the chair and leadership will be there and explain to us exactly what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said.\n\nSome members are hopeful that kind of clarification will come after the committee votes Thursday on procedural rules for the investigation.\n\nThe new procedures would allow Mr. Nadler to create subcommittees to review evidence, expand time committee staff can question witnesses, and give the president\u2019s legal team access to some evidence as well as an opportunity to respond in writing.\n\nMr. Raskin said that there\u2019s no constitutionally-defined term for an impeachment investigation, but is confident the party will be on the same page on how to move forward.\n\n\u201cThe words investigation or inquiry don\u2019t appear in the Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a unified message on how to proceed and then put the focus on presidential misconduct.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
