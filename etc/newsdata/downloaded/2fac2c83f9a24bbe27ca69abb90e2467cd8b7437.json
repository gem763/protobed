CNN recently hosted a seven-hour climate event for Democrat presidential aspirants. Every day brings more gloom-and-doom stories about absurd, often taxpayer-funded pseudo-scientific reports on yet another natural event or supposed calamity that alarmists insist are due to fossil fuels that provide 80% of US and global energy.\n\nMSNBC just hosted another two-day Democrat presidential candidates climate forum at Georgetown University \u2013 where I spoke at a contrarian program. Meanwhile, a big Climate March took place in New York City, while protesters tried to block Washington, DC streets. They were all kicking off the UN\u2019s \u201cGlobal Climate Week\u201d in NYC, featuring a Youth Climate Summit and UN General Assembly event where world leaders will demand \u201cglobal action\u201d to supposedly stop the supposed climate crisis.\n\nTheir standard solution is biofuel, solar, wind and battery power. My recent article dumped buckets of icy cold reality on several of those claims. They obviously need to be doused with a few more icy buckets.\n\nTo reiterate: Wind and sunshine are free, renewable, sustainable and eco-friendly. However, the lands and raw materials required for technologies to harness this widely dispersed, intermittent, weather-dependent energy to benefit humanity absolutely are not. In fact, their environmental impacts are monumental.\n\nThe Democrat candidates and their supporters want to replace coal and gas backup power plants with batteries, to ensure we have (much more expensive) electricity even when intermittent, weather-dependent wind and sunshine refuse to cooperate with our need for 24/7/365 power for our electricity-based homes, schools, hospitals, factories, businesses, computers, social media, and civilization.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose we blanket the United States with enough industrial-scale wind and solar facilities to replace the 3.9 billion megawatt-hours Americans used in 2018 \u2013 and we manufacture and install enough king-sized batteries to store sufficient electricity for seven straight windless or sunless days.\n\nWe would need something on the order of one billion 100-kilowatt-hour, 1,000-pound lithium and cobalt-based battery packs \u2013 similar to what Tesla uses in its electric vehicles. (This does not include the extra battery storage required to charge up the cars, trucks, and buses we are supposed to replace with EVs.)\n\nAll these batteries would support the millions and millions of Green New Deal solar panels and wind turbines we would have to build and install. They would require prodigious amounts of iron, copper, rare earth metals, concrete, and other raw materials. And every one of these batteries, turbines, and panels would have to be replaced far more often than coal, gas, nuclear or hydroelectric power plants.\n\nIndeed, what are we going do with all those worn-out and broken-down turbines, panels, and batteries? The International Renewable Energy Agency has said disposing of just the worn-out solar panels that the UN wants to be erected around the world by 2050, under the Paris Climate Treaty\u2019s solar energy goals, could result in two times the tonnage of the United States\u2019 total plastic waste in 2017!\n\nSo another icy cold reality is this: All this \u201cfree, renewable, sustainable, eco-friendly, ethical\u201d energy would require the biggest expansion in mining the world has ever seen. But when was the last time any environmentalist or Democrat supported opening a single US mine? They detest mining.\n\nWhich brings us to the dirtiest pseudo-renewable, pseudo-sustainable energy secret of all \u2013 the one these folks absolutely do not want to talk about: slave and child labor.\n\nBecause of rabid environmentalist opposition, the United States and Europe no longer permit much mining within their borders. They just import minerals \u2013 many of them from China and Russia. And the same groups that extol the virtues of wind, solar and battery power are equally opposed to Western mining companies extracting rare earth, lithium, cadmium, cobalt, and other minerals almost anywhere on Planet Earth \u2013 even under rigorous Western labor, safety, environmental and reclamation rules.\n\nThat means those materials are mined and processed in places like Baotou, Inner Mongolia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, mostly under Chinese control. They are dug out and processed by fathers, mothers, and children \u2013 under horrific, unsafe, inhumane conditions that few of us can even imagine ... under almost nonexistent labor, wage, health, safety, and pollution standards.\n\nThat renewable energy, high-tech slaves get a few pennies or dollars a day \u2013 while risking cave-ins and being exposed constantly to filthy, toxic, radioactive mud, dust, water and air. The mining and industrial areas become vast toxic wastelands, where nothing grows, and no people or wildlife can live.\n\nFor cobalt alone \u2013 say UNICEF and Amnesty International \u2013 over 40,000 Congolese children, as young as four years old, slave away in mines, from sunrise to sundown, six or even seven days a week. That\u2019s today. Imagine how many will be needed to serve the \u201cethical green energy utopia.\u201d\n\nGreen New Dealers demand sustainable, ethical, human rights-based coffee, sneakers, T-shirts, handbags, and diamonds. Absolutely no child labor, sweatshop, or toxic, polluted workplace conditions allowed. But they have little or nothing to say about the Chinese, Russian and other companies that run the horrid operations that provide their wind turbines, solar panels, smart grids \u2013 and batteries for their cell phones, Teslas, laptops, and backup electrical power.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen them make ethical wind turbines, solar panels and batteries an issue. They\u2019ve never protested outside a Chinese, Russian or Congolese embassy, or corporate headquarters in Beijing, Moscow or Kinshasa. They probably don\u2019t want to get shot or sent to gulags.\n\nAnd just a few weeks ago, California legislators voted down Assembly Bill 735. The bill simply said California would certify that \u201czero-emission\u201d electric vehicles sold in the state must be free of any materials or components that involve child labor. The issue is complicated, the legislators said. It would be too hard to enforce. It would imperil state climate goals. And besides, lots of other industries also use child labor ... they \u201cexplained.\u201d\n\nAs Milton Friedman said, there is no free lunch. Wind, solar, biofuel and battery power are not free, clean, green, renewable or sustainable. America must not let delusion, dishonesty, and ideology drive public policies that will determine our future jobs, prosperity, living standards, freedoms, and civilization.\n\nWhat Green New Dealers are talking about has nothing to do with stopping dangerous manmade climate change \u2013 or with real sustainability, resource conservation or environmental protection. It has everything to do with increasingly socialist, largely taxpayer-financed activists, politicians, regulators and crony capitalists controlling people\u2019s lives; dictating our energy use, economic growth, job opportunities, and living standards; and getting richer, more powerful and more privileged in the process.\n\nMeanwhile poor, minority and working-class families \u2013 pay the price. And destitute families in hungry, impoverished, electricity-deprived nations pay the highest price. China, India, Indonesia, and Africa are not about to give up their determined efforts to take their rightful, God-given places among Earth\u2019s healthy and prosperous people. They are not going to stop using fossil fuels to reach their goals.\n\nThey are not going to let anyone \u2013 including the UN, EU, US Democrats and other eco-imperialists \u2013 tell them they can never enjoy those blessings. Or they will be \u201callowed\u201d to improve their health and living standards only at the margins, only to levels achievable with wind, solar and cow dung power.\n\nThat\u2019s why even as the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by 12% between 2000 and 2017 \u2013 India\u2019s plant-fertilizing CO2 emissions soared by 140% and China\u2019s skyrocketed 194% \u2013 further greening Planet Earth. In 2019 alone, China alone will add more coal-fired generating capacity than what all existing US coal-fired power plants generate.\n\nWhile all these countries continue using more and more fossil fuels to improve their economies, health, and living standards \u2013 why in heaven\u2019s name would the United States want to join Green New Dealers and other crazies in an environment-destroying ban-fossil-fuels economic suicide pact?\n\nPaul Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (www.CFACT.org) and author of books and articles on energy, climate, environmental and human rights issues.", "description": "The full-court press is on for climate chaos disaster and .09/21/2019 3:13:25AM EST.", "authors": ["Paul Driessen", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/20/37063aa6-84c6-4c41-b855-1a2b397ec9ee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
