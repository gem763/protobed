The trouble is the Aston Villa manager has to laugh or else he would launch into a tirade about how VAR has sapped the life out of football.\n\n\u2018Embarrassing,\u2019 was the word Smith used quite rightly after Wesley was judged, according to VAR, to have obstructed Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan before Conor Hourihane crashed the ball into the away net. Referee David Coote\u2019s view that it was a 50/50 challenge was overturned by officials at Stockley Park but surely it didn\u2019t pass the threshold required for them to do so.\n\nSmith has been on the receiving end of decisions against Arsenal, Burnley and Crystal Palace, but this one didn\u2019t match with what he had been told in pre-season.\n\nDean Smith believes VAR is draining the entertainment out of Premier League football\n\n\u2018For that to be the first subjective decision I\u2019ve seen just threw me totally,\u2019 Smith said. \u2018The criteria is clear and obvious and that wasn\u2019t clear and obvious and unless I missed a memo over the international break then nothing has changed.\u2019\n\nIt was a bizarre experience for anyone inside Villa Park. It wasn\u2019t until Coote neared the centre circle that he took advice from Stockley Park and ruled out the goal.\n\nUltimately, it wouldn\u2019t matter as Jack Grealish, who performed exceptionally in front of England manager Gareth Southgate, equalised from close range before half-time. That cancelled out Adam Webster\u2019s header for Brighton and came after Aaron Mooy\u2019s stupid sending off for two yellow cards.\n\nReferee David Coote controversially ruled out Conor Hourihane's goal after consulting VAR\n\nThe concern for Smith, though, is that he feels VAR has already set a dangerous precedent.\n\nAnd when Grealish supplied Matt Targett for Villa\u2019s winner in the 94th minute, the home crowd didn\u2019t respond as they usually would to a late goal.\n\nIt led Smith to ponder the consequences had VAR dared to suggest the goal was illegitimate.\n\nSmith suggested Villa fans may have been reluctant to celebrate Matt Targett's winning goal\n\nHe said: \u2018It\u2019s disappointing that we scored a winner with 10 seconds to go and you can\u2019t really celebrate because you\u2019ve got to wait for the process of VAR, which takes an awful lot of the fun out. There might have been a riot here if that had been disallowed at the end.\u2019\n\nThankfully, for Grealish this was a match to celebrate. He may well have created six chances, scoring the equaliser and assisting the winner, but it was his defensive work, particularly a 60-yard dash to block a shot in the second half, which left Smith purring.\n\n\u2018The things he does are standing out more because of the quality of the teams we are up against in the Premier League,\u2019 he said.", "description": "TOM FARMERY AT VILLA PARK: It has got to the point where Dean Smith laughs when he talks about VAR as if it were a joke.
