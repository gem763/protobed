The hot red pepper jelly makes for a spicier glaze, but you can always turn down the heat a bit at home by opting for a sweet pepper jelly.\n\nIngredients:\n\n- 12 chicken drumsticks (about 3 pounds)\n\n- 2 tablespoons canola oil\n\n- Salt and freshly ground pepper\n\n- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n\n- 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion 2 red or purple plums (4 ounces each), pitted and cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n\n- 1/4 cup hot or sweet red pepper jelly\n\n- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n\n- 1/4 cup water\n\nInstructions:\n\nLight a grill. Rub the chicken with the canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill over moderate heat, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 30 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt the butter. Add the onion and cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the plums and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until softened and nearly broken down, about 5 minutes. Add the red pepper jelly and mustard and bring to a boil, stirring until the jelly is melted. Carefully transfer the mixture to a food processor. Add the water and puree until smooth. Season the plum sauce with salt and pepper.\n\nLiberally brush the plum sauce all over the chicken and grill, turning the drumsticks occasionally, until they are lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. Serve the drumsticks with any remaining plum sauce at the table.\n\nRecipe courtesy Grace Parisi of Food and Wine magazine\n\nRobert Irvine's Sesame and Hoisin baby back ribs recipe\n\nABC News\n\nIrvine, of the Food Network\u2019s \u201cWorst Cooks in America,\u201d shared this original baby back ribs recipe that features the complex flavors of hoison sauce with peanut butter and sambal or sriracha hot sauce.
