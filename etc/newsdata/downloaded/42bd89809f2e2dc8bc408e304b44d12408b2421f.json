It was so sloppy that at one point in the second quarter the Lakers were shooting just 31 percent from the floor \u2014 and they were in the lead.\n\nIn the second half, LeBron James changed that.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHe started to assert his will on the game, was more aggressive, got to the rim, and shot 8-of-13 in the half. The Lakers started Anthony Davis at center in the second half (to help pull Rudy Gobert out of the paint) and AD and LeBron formed a pick-and-roll combo the Jazz had fwq answers for. It all worked, the Lakers pulled away for a 95-86 win.\n\nLeBron finished with 32 points, 10 assists, and seven rebounds.\n\nDavis finished with 21 points and showed some real chemistry with LeBron.\n\nIt\u2019s a win against a quality opponent in their home opener, something the Lakers could use after opening night.", "description": "After a sloppy first half, LeBron imposed his will on the game.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DL8gbyR5zoXTbp0kKRwpcg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuNzAzNzc3MzM1OTg0MQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/13VEge8J7q0zgLytsa7cTQ--~B/aD01Njg7dz0xMDA2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/0c025194cf6613a4177db9df8b87de18", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
