However, a minority of economists tracked by Bloomberg see the central bank holding steady this time around.\n\nWhen the Fed started new easing cycles in 2001 and 2007 with 50 basis point cuts, it \u201cimplied they were more worried than they were letting on,\u201d Detrick reasoned. Since the cuts so far have just been 25 basis points each, they can easily be viewed as \u201cinsurance\u201d as opposed to warding off impending recession.\n\n\u201cAs history shows, we don\u2019t have to fear,\u201d Detrick concluded.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joanna Ossinger in Singapore at jossinger@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Anstey at canstey@bloomberg.net, Andreea Papuc, Cormac Mullen\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve is forecast to cut interest rates for a third time this year by a quarter point, which would be a good sign for stocks if history is any guide, according to LPL Financial LLC. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen periods of economic slowdowns that had three consecutive 25 basis point cuts,", "authors": ["Joanna Ossinger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PR9BHSbZHc2tb58cZwXWUg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b31c283e8bbc4f1561288a95ba239570", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
