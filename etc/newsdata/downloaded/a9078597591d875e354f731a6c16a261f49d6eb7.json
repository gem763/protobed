That might be the motto of some investors recalling last October\u2019s painful sell-off. As European equities struggle to reach new peaks, more than hope is needed for the market to go higher. Better earnings would help and thankfully, the reporting season is fast approaching. But real improvement is far from certain.\n\nThe trouble is, global revisions to profit estimates have been consistently negative for the past six months. And if you omit a tiny positive print in April, they\u2019ve actually been downgraded for about 14 months now.\n\nStrategists including Oddo BHF\u2019s Sylvain Goyon are struggling to be optimistic about the market\u2019s prospects without an improvement in earnings per share. Consensus EPS growth forecasts for the Stoxx 600 are still standing at 9.2% for 2020, so further downwards revisions are inevitable, he says. Goyon\u2019s own forecast is for just 2% growth next year.\n\nThat\u2019s why recent market bounces are unlikely to last, Goyon says. He\u2019s doubtful of a swift resolution in the trade war and sees hopes for fiscal stimulus as \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d\n\nBarclays\u2019 strategist Emmanuel Cau is on the same page in seeing a need for EPS revisions to bottom out, skeptical of an immediate upside. He argues that more is needed to see a breakout from the current range, which is similar to the pre-jump market movement seen in late 2016. As for the one-year outperformance of bonds against equities, it\u2019s unlikely to reverse unless the macro backdrop improves. That may be some way off. Citi\u2019s data show economic surprises have soared to their highest level since April, 2018 in the U.S. this week, while they went back to the doldrums in Europe.\n\nDuring the latest market bounce, equities finally recorded inflows, although very little for European stocks and some positioning trends don\u2019t look bullish. Systematic trend-followers (CTAs) were forced to cover shorts on major European equity futures and flipped to the long side, according to Nomura Cross-Asset Quantitative Strategist Masanari Takada, who remains doubtful that the trend has legs. Takada says CTAs\u2019 net exposure is strongly correlated to economic momentum like German Ifo and economic surprises, while hedge funds tend to add longs on European stocks when inflation expectations rise. None of this data is positive at the moment.\n\nTechnically, the Stoxx 600 has failed to break out of its cap of around 392.4 points and sold off on the five occasions it was tested. LCM technical analyst Andy Dodd says the index formed a bearish reversal pattern after the last breakout attempt.\n\nIn the meantime, Euro Stoxx 50 futures are up 0.1% ahead of the European open, while S&P 500 contracts are down 0.2%.\n\nSECTORS IN FOCUS TODAY:\n\nWatch Henkel after U.S. adhesives maker HB Fuller tumbled in extended trading following a cut to its earnings guidance.
