U.S. intelligence officials ultimately determined the Saudi government was behind the Saudi journalist\u2019s killing.\n\nA transcript of that call was never circulated to U.S. officials, as would have normally been the case, CNN reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear when the call with Putin took place, but CNN, citing a former Trump administration official, reported that access to that transcript was also heavily restricted.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Friday that White House officials also limited access to Trump\u2019s conversation with two senior Russian officials in the Oval Office in 2017. The president allegedly said during that meeting that he wasn\u2019t concerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election because the U.S. had done the same in other countries.\n\nOnly a handful of officials with the highest security clearances were allowed to see a summary of the meeting in an attempt to prevent it from being made public, the Post reported, citing former officials who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe reports follows the public release of a whistleblower complaint that alleged the Trump administration repeatedly stored records of the president\u2019s calls in an electronic system reserved for \u201cespecially sensitive\u201d classified information to protect him politically.\n\nThe White House specifically tried to \u201clock down\u201d the president\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump urged Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, according to the complaint.\n\nWhite House lawyers instructed that the summary of the call be \u201cplaced into a standalone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nThe complaint noted: \u201cThis set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what transpired in the call.\u201d\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Friday that he hoped Trump\u2019s call with Putin would not be made public, as a summary of the U.S. president\u2019s call with Zelensky was earlier this week.\n\n\u201cWe would like to hope that things won\u2019t come to such situations in our bilateral relations, which already have plenty of quite serious problems,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cThis is a rather unusual practice. As a rule, the materials from conversations on the level of the head of state are considered secret or top secret.\u201d", "description": "It appears the administration may have tried to \"lock down\" Trump's conversations with foreign leaders before the July 25 call to Ukraine's president.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8ea2302100003400600436.jpeg?cache=nvagh5s5ti&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
