They really need to shut it down and give athletes a chance to train under someone new and fresh.\u201d\n\nSalazar, who guided Britain\u2019s four-time Olympic champion Mo Farah from 2011 until 2017, says he has done nothing wrong and will appeal the ban.\n\nNike has said it will support Salazar in his appeal, with the US sportswear giant arguing that the decision over Salazar \u201chad nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete\u201d.\n\nGoucher turned whistleblower in 2013, making claims of wrongdoing by Salazar. Two years later she told a BBC TV documentary he had encouraged her to take thyroid medication to help her lose weight after having a baby.\n\nShe later testified at two arbitration hearings in the Salazar case.\n\nIn Doha, the Salazar-coached Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands took the women\u2019s 1,500m and 10,000m titles and angrily hit out at speculation about her performances, saying she had \u201cshown the world I am a clean athlete\u201d and that she was ready to be tested every day to prove her innocence.\n\nUS runner Donavan Brazier was the other NOP athlete to win gold, taking the men\u2019s 800m title. He said he was trained by another coach within the group and had little contact with Salazar.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 An athlete-turned-whistleblower previously coached by banned coach Alberto Salazar has called for his Nike Oregon Project (NOP) to be", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/417a7f_an-athlete-who-gave-key-evidence-banned-us-coach-alberto-salazar-has-called-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
