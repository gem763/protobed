Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), a member of the House Oversight Committee, told VICE News.\n\nRead: The Impeachment Investigation Might Get Its Most Damning Testimony on Tuesday\n\n\u201cBased on the opening statements in the public domain, Ambassador Taylor drives a stake through any possible legal defense that Donald Trump would have,\u201d Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) told VICE News as he headed in to listen to more of Taylor\u2019s ongoing testimony. \u201cHe\u2019s very clear in that statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the most damning testimony that I\u2019ve heard so far\u201d\n\nDemocrats called the career diplomat\u2019s version of events credible and troubling, and said it added detail to Taylor\u2019s previously released text messages in which he expressed alarm about Trump tying military assistance to Ukraine to \u201chelp with a political campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a very long opening statement. And it was based on meticulous notes he had taken of meetings and phone conversations and the like,\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), another Oversight Committee member, told reporters.\n\nTaylor was one of the few people running U.S. policy toward Ukraine in the last few months after the Trump administration pushed out Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Unlike others involved in the saga, Taylor\u2019s a career diplomat with no direct loyalty to Trump. He raised the alarm multiple times about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine until its leaders agreed to investigate Trump\u2019s Democratic political rivals.\n\nThat includes a text message where Taylor made sure to put his concerns into writing to then-U.S. special representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker and Sondland.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it is crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor texted.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony was \u201cexcruciatingly detailed,\u201d and included details of that key phone call, Wasserman Schultz said.\n\n\u201cHis testimony really stood in stark contrast to Ambassador Sondland\u2019s, who had a non-credible amount of lapses in memory,\u201d she added.\n\nThat could spell trouble for Sondland, who in testimony to the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees last week sought to protect himself even as he pointed the finger at Rudy Giuliani. Sondland repeatedly said he didn\u2019t remember the details of their conversations, and multiple Democrats who heard both Sondland\u2019s and Taylor\u2019s testimony implied that Sondland hadn\u2019t been straight with the committee.\n\n\"After today, Mr. Sondland is going to have some explaining to do,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), a member of the House Intelligence and Oversight committees.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of investigations \u2014 in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance,\u2019\u201d Taylor reportedly told House investigators.\n\nDemocrats declared themselves bowled over by Taylor\u2019s opening statement in particular. But one prominent Trump supporter in the room said things got better for Trump after that.\n\n\u201cI think pieces of the puzzle are being put together\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought the second hour was very good,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), adding that he viewed Taylor\u2019s testimony as \u201cconsistent\u201d with what other witnesses like Sondland have said.\n\nJordan said that after Taylor\u2019s opening statement, his remarks \u201cbuttressed\u201d some of Trump\u2019s concerns about Ukraine. Trump\u2019s defenders have suggested his administration withheld hundreds of millions in aid to Ukraine approved by Congress out of concerns about corruption.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s information that I think came out, I think, particularly in the second hour, that underscores concerns that the president had about Ukraine in general,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nJordan is in the minority, however.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony was \u201cdisturbing,\u201d said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.).\n\n\u201cI think pieces of the puzzle are being put together,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more distinct.\u201d\n\nRep. Harley Rouda (D-Calif.) told reporters that Taylor\u2019s testimony \u201cwas very compelling, detailed and specific,\u201d and elicited \u201ca lot of sighs and gasps\u201d with his opening testimony.\n\n\u201cAll I have to say is that in my 10 short months in Congress... this is my most disturbing day in Congress so far,\u201d said Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.).\n\nCover: UNITED STATES - OCTOBER 22: Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, arrives to the Capitol for a deposition related to the House's impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, October 22, 2019.
