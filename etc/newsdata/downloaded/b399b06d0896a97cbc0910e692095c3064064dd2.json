REUTERS/Lee Celano/File Photo\n\nBy Timothy Gardner\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed two bills banning new offshore oil and gas drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and Florida and was set to vote on a third banning drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe first bill, sponsored by Representative Francis Rooney, a conservative Florida Republican who supports action to tackle climate change, would permanently ban oil and gas leasing in parts of the Gulf of Mexico close to his state\u2019s coast.\n\nThe measure passed 248 to 180, with the support of about 20 Republicans. Rooney said a series of spills from oil and gas operations in the gulf have threatened jobs in marine recreation and fishing.\n\nThe bills were not expected to gain traction in the Republican-led Senate. But the votes in the Democratic-led House of Representatives were meant to send a signal to Republicans who have supported rollbacks of environmental regulations on oil and gas.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump has called for opening up oil and gas production and reversed or weakened regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas operations and carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers also hoped to gain momentum on climate issues as Democratic hopefuls in the 2020 presidential campaign tout their climate change plans, many of which seek to reverse some of Trump\u2019s energy policies.\n\nThe House also passed a measure by 238 to 189 sponsored by Representative Joe Cunningham, a South Carolina Democrat, to permanently ban oil and gas leasing off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.\n\n\u201cThis bill acknowledges that if we don\u2019t act, drilling rigs could soon appear off of our beaches,\u201d said Cunningham, whose state\u2019s beaches are a major tourist draw.\n\nOil and gas interests opposed the bills, saying that bans only increase U.S. dependency on foreign oil.\n\n\u201cCongress should reject these bills, which would only outsource energy production to countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia, and instead stand up American energy produced with American values,\u201d said Tim Charters, a vice president at the National Ocean Industries Association.\n\nThe House was expected to vote on Thursday on a bill sponsored by Representative Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, to stop the Trump administration from opening the Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to drilling.\n\nConservationists consider ANWR to be one of the last pristine places left on Earth. It is home to wildlife populations including caribou, polar bears and millions of birds that migrate to six of the seven continents.", "description": "The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed two bills banning new offshore oil and gas drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and Florida and was set to vote on a third banning drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.", "authors": ["Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428898968&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1VJ"}
