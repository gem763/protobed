The company has reportedly already approached one potential buyer, the sports-focused streaming service FuboTV, with a sale that would include the service\u2019s approximately 500,000-strong subscriber base, alongside its underlying technology. That customer tally is substantially less than other subscription TV services, despite PlayStation Vue being one of the first such services to launch.\n\nThe Information\u2019s report claims that Sony\u2019s streaming service is continuing to lose money, despite several subscription price hikes, most recently a $5 increase in July of this year. Sony is struggling with the rising cost of programming, which is thought to be hitting the company harder than its competitors. Unlike, say, Hulu, Sony doesn\u2019t have as big of a content library of its own, which leaves it with less leverage in its negotiations. The Information notes that it\u2019s unclear whether Sony\u2019s programming contracts would transfer to PlayStation Vue\u2019s new owner after a sale.\n\nThe streaming wars are coming\n\nFrom a technology standpoint, PlayStation Vue offers some unique features. If you\u2019re using the service on an Apple TV, for example, you can currently watch as many as four streams simultaneously on a single screen. On a PlayStation 4, this limit drops to three, but the PlayStation Vue has the advantage of being the only internet TV service available. Sony has so far refused to allow competitors like Sling TV, YouTube TV, and Hulu\u2019s live TV service onto the platform. Should Vue be sold to an outside company, that could potentially change.\n\nSony may have picked a good time to get out of the streaming business, as the market will soon become a lot more crowded with a host of new players. Disney+ and Apple TV Plus are both coming next month, AT&T\u2019s HBO Max is due next year, and NBCUniversal is readying its Peacock service as well. With each of these companies investing heavily in exclusive content \u2014 and with Vue already trailing other internet TV providers \u2014 Sony\u2019s challenges aren\u2019t going anywhere.", "description": "Sony is currently looking for a buyer of its PlayStation Vue streaming service, according to a new report.
