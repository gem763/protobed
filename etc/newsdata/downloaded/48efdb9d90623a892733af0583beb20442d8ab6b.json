Beyond this, the possibility of the world tipping into unstoppable and catastrophic climate change becomes much more likely.\n\nThese ideas are not new, and many are already happening. It\u2019s the pace of change that\u2019s the problem.\n\n\u201cWhile solutions exist,\u201d the report says, \u201cthe scale of transformation requires system-wide action accelerated by climate leadership, much stronger policy, finance and exponential technologies.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the report\u2019s key suggestions:\n\nSolar and wind are cheaper \u2015 stop propping up fossil fuels\n\njia yu via Getty Images Wind turbines in Zhejiang province, China. In many places wind and solar power are already cheaper than fossil fuels.\n\nWhile investment continues to pour into fossil fuels, and governments around the world pay out $5.2 trillion in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, solar and wind power are now in many instances cheaper. Last year, renewables accounted for nearly 75% of all electricity installations, according to the report.\n\nAllowing renewables like wind and solar to continue to grow exponentially would halve emissions from electricity generation over the next decade, according to the report. With the right policies and pricings, cities could see as much as 70% of their electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nThe report also calls for policies supporting those who may lose out in the transition to renewables \u2015 for example coal miners \u2015 so they do not get left behind socially or economically.\n\nEmbrace electric cars\n\n3alexd via Getty Images Electric vehicles have the potential to reach a 90% market share by 2030, according to the report.\n\nWe have the technology and the capability to reduce transport emissions to zero, according to the report, which says that if the rapid growth of electric cars is allowed to continue, 90% of cars could be electric by 2030.\n\nCities are already making commitments. Seattle is planning a ban on new fossil fuel-powered cars by 2030. The trajectory is even clearer in Europe, with more than two dozen cities, including Paris and London, setting bans on fossil fuel-powered cars within the next decade. And automakers, such as Volkswagen and Volvo, have made commitments to produce only electric or hybrid vehicles.\n\nBetter mass transit and a move away from private car ownership to sharing are also recommended.\n\nCut down on meat\n\nSteve Russell via Getty Images Reducing meat consumption and opting for a more plant-based diet would cut global emissions.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the food system is broken, featuring unsustainable farming practices that cause deforestation, pollution and biodiversity loss. And while there is enough food to feed the global population, 820 million people don\u2019t have enough to eat.\n\n\u201cFood and agriculture is the dark horse in the fight against climate change. It may be the hardest sector to rapidly halve emissions,\u201d said Brent Loken from the EAT Foundation, who wrote the report\u2019s chapter on food.\n\nThe report calls for removing the subsidies that help prop up an unhealthy, intensive and destructive food system. More than $1 million a minute of public money is being spent on these subsidies globally, according to a different report, published on Monday.\n\nDiet is another pressure point. A raft of recent studies have pointed to a need to reduce meat intake and adopt a more plant-based diet, especially for those living in rich countries. The new report calls for a move to diets plentiful in fruits, legumes and vegetables.\n\nRestore nature\n\nLeoFFreitas via Getty Images Huge areas of the Amazon are deforested for cattle, timber and other industries.\n\nNatural systems, from forests to peatlands, store huge amounts of carbon, but many of these ecosystems are being destroyed for agriculture and industry. The report suggests nature-based solutions, including halting deforestation and reforesting, reducing the use of fertilizers, better managing farmland and restoring peatland. These solutions could potentially store 9.1 billion tons of CO2 a year, according to the report.\n\nMake industry less dirty\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A cement factory in The Netherlands. Cement has a huge climate footprint and is responsible for around 8% of global CO2 emissions.\n\nStronger emissions standards, especially for climate-intensive industries such as steel, cement and plastics, are key, says the report. It calls for all industries to set targets to halve their emissions by 2030.\n\nThe report also advocates a circular economy model that keeps resources in the economy for as long as possible \u2015 through reuse, repurposing and recycling \u2015 rather than sending them straight to landfill.\n\n\u201cThis could provide half of the emissions reductions we need by 2030 from key industry,\u201d said Johan Falk, co-lead author on the report and a fellow at Stockholm Resilience Centre and Future Earth, Sweden.\n\nNew technology, says the report, would allow better tracking of where products come from and where they end up, as well as help make processes more efficient.\n\nGive power to the people\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, center, participates in a youth climate strike outside the United Nations, on Aug. 30, 2019 in New York.\n\nSocial movements are a key part of this change, according to the report. It mentions the Fridays for Future movement, kicked off by teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, which has seen school-aged children around the world striking from classes to protest global inaction on the climate crisis.\n\nThe movement is gaining momentum, and is the driving force behind global climate strikes happening this month in which will see people of all ages take to the streets to demand action.\n\nThese movements are having an impact. Earlier this year, Mohammed Barkindo, the OPEC secretary general, said the growing mass mobilization against oil is beginning to \u201cdictate policies and corporate decisions, including investment in the industry.\u201d\n\nChristiana Figueres, former head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and who was involved in the report, said: \u201cI see all evidence that social and economic tipping points are aligning. We can now say the next decade has the potential to see the fastest economic transition in history.\u201d\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.\n\nHuffPost\u2019s \u201cThis New World\u201d series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.
