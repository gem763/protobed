RATCLIFFE BLASTS DEMS AFTER LEWANDOWSKI HEARING ON IMPEACHMENT: THEIR STRATEGY IS 'INCOHERENT'\n\nThe hearing descended into chaos as Democrats clashed with a combative Lewandowski, trading insults and accusations with the former Trump campaign manager, who refused to answer many of their questions.\n\nAfter five hours of testimony before lawmakers, the top Democrat on the committee, Nadler, told Lewandowski his \u201cbehavior in this hearing room has been completely unacceptable\u201d and said holding him \"in contempt\" is \"certainly under consideration.\"\n\n\u201cI know Corey fairly well. I can assure you he did not wet his pants in that hearing room yesterday, he was enjoying every minute of it,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\nJORDAN AND MEADOWS BLAST DEMOCRATS FOR AVOIDING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION\n\nHuckabee said that Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants House Democrats to stop the Trump impeachment investigation because they are \u201cplaying into the Republicans' hands\" and that the Democratic caucus \u201cought to listen to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi didn\u2019t approve of it,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHuckabee also said that Pelosi knows that in order to impeach Trump, she would need 218 votes in the House, which is unlikely to happen.\n\nFurthermore, he said even if she did get those votes, the impeachment push would \u201cdie in the Senate and embarrass the entire Democratic caucus.\u201d Huckabee said Pelosi is interested in keeping the majority in 2020 and potentially picking up Senate seats.\n\n\"You're not gonna get it if what you're known for is a phony impeachment process,\" he said.\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Arkansas Gov.
