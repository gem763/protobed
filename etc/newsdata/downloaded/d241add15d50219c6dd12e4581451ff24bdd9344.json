About 50,000 animals are buried at the cemetery, which opened in 1920. Mangin researches the cemetery's history and shares its stories on a blog. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nJulianne Mangin knows where the bodies are buried. Not all 50,000 of them, but enough to turn a stroll with her through Aspin Hill Memorial Park into a fascinating rumination on how much we love the Mickeys, Shastas, Snowballs and Macaronis of our lives.\n\nMickey, Shasta, Snowball and Macaroni are \u2014 were \u2014 dogs and cats. They are buried at Aspin Hill, a 99-year-old pet cemetery near Georgia Avenue and Aspen Hill Road in Silver Spring.\n\nMangin, 63, a retired librarian who grew up nearby, has become the unofficial historian of the place, telling stories of the residents and their owners at petcemeterystories.net. She visits frequently, seeking to uncover graves \u2014 literally and figuratively.\n\n\u201cThis is my aerating tool from Home Depot,\u201d Mangin said on a recent weekday afternoon, pulling a long, four-pronged gadget from the back of her Subaru.\n\nMany of the old stone grave markers have sunk into the ground and become covered with dirt, grass and leaves. When Mangin sees a depression in the earth, she deploys her tool.\n\n\u201cYou push the aerator down until you hear a \u2018clink,\u2019\u201d Mangin explained. \u201cThe prongs are four inches deep. I really don\u2019t want to find anything lower than four inches. And if I find nothing, at least the soil is nicely aerated.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome of the grave markers bear porcelain images of the animals. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nAspin Hill \u2014 it\u2019s named after a kennel in England, thus the spelling \u2014 was founded in 1920 by Richard and Bertha Birney. It was the only animal cemetery within 200 miles of Washington, attracting well-heeled pet owners wishing to memorialize their pets.\n\nThey were people like Selma Snook , who \u2014 after throwing elaborate wakes \u2014 buried poodles Boots, Buster, Trixie and Snowball in a family plot, their tombstones arranged side by side and enclosed with a low metal fence.\n\nThere\u2019s a single headstone just outside of where the now-rusted fence once stood. Mangin thinks it might be for Snook\u2019s cat.\n\n\u201cI was told the cat was buried there because it didn\u2019t get along with the dogs,\u201d said Mangin.\n\nWhy should we expect animals to be any different in death than in life?\n\n\n\nAn urban legend has it that Petey, the dog from the \u201cOur Gang\u201d films, is buried at Aspin Hill. Mangin debunked that notion. She thinks a bulldog named General Grant of R.K.O. was confused with Petey. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nMangin led me to the grave of a collie named Pal, who died on Aug. 15, 1928.\n\nDied? Well, it\u2019s more complicated than that. \u201cHe preferred death to life away from his master,\u201d the inscription on Pal\u2019s stone begins. \u201cThis ever faithful barking ghost may leap to lick your phantom hand.\u201d\n\nA bit creepy. And there\u2019s no denying there\u2019s a creepy vibe to the place. Aspin Hill is in the nicest shape it\u2019s been in years: the grass mowed, many of the tombstones cleared and cleaned. But all cemeteries are mementos mori \u2014 reminders of death \u2014 and it\u2019s no different here.\n\nThe story of Pal, though, is particularly dark. The 13-year-old dog was owned by Mr. and Mrs. Eric Matus of Capitol Heights, Md., who drowned when their skiff overturned in the Potomac. Pal was reportedly inconsolable, refusing to allow anyone to approach and ignoring food left for him.\n\nIt was said that Matus had left instructions for the dog to be euthanized if he and his wife died. Dozens of people protested the dog\u2019s execution, offering to take in Pal.\n\n\u201cBut these good people did not understand,\u201d Mrs. M.R. Blumenberg of the Animal Rescue League told The Washington Post. \u201cPal could never be happy again. Anybody who saw the look of anguish in his eyes would know it. I have seen collies in somewhat similar circumstances slowly die of broken hearts.\u201d\n\nA week after the Matuses\u2019 death, Pal went to the great kennel in the sky.\n\nThere\u2019s a sunnier story behind Napoleon, a white Persian cat hailed as the \u201cWeather Prophet of Baltimore.\u201d Owner Fanny de Shields noticed that whenever Napoleon changed his sleeping position, rain would fall within 24 hours. When a story ran in the Baltimore Sun in 1930 noting the moggy\u2019s meteorological prowess, de Shields was inundated.\n\n\u201cShe had to field calls from farmers and people planning outdoor weddings,\u201d Mangin said.\n\nThe cemetery covers about eight acres. It has passed through the paws of several owners over the years \u2014 including PETA\u2019s \u2014 before it was donated in 2007 to the Montgomery County Humane Society, which plans to build its headquarters on a two-acre parcel that contains no remains.\n\nMangin is delighted to debunk some of the tales that have grown up around Aspin Hill. Yes, J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s Airedale Spee De Bozo is buried here, but Petey, the dog from the \u201cOur Gang\u201d movies, is not.\n\nMangin thinks people were confused by a tombstone reading \u201cGeneral Grant of R.K.O.\u201d RKO was a studio, though not the one that made the \u201cOur Gang\u201d films.\n\nSaid Mangin: \u201cPetey is buried in Los Angeles, because why would you fly a dead dog across the country when there are pet cemeteries in Los Angeles?\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s little we won\u2019t do for our pets, even in death. Andy, a capuchin monkey, is buried under a tombstone adorned with his color photo. He\u2019s dressed in blue pants and a pinafore.\n\n\u201cI will always love you,\u201d reads the inscription.\n\nIs that the owner talking about Andy, or Andy talking about the owner?\n\nAspin Hill is open during daylight hours. Mangin will give a talk on the cemetery on Oct. 4 at 7 p.m. at the Gaithersburg Community Museum.
