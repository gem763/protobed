With Azure Sentinel, Microsoft has now officially entered the SIEM market.\n\nSIEM stands for security information and event management (SIEM) and is a type of software used by cyber-security teams.\n\nSIEM products can be cloud-based systems or locally-running apps. They work by gathering information from different sources, such as OS, application, antivirus, database, or server logs, and analyzing these large quantities of data for anomalies or signs of a security incident.\n\nBecause of their ability to spot the needle in the haystack,SIEM products have become widely adopted in enterprise networks, where cyber-security departments need to keep an eye on hundreds, if not thousands, of threat indicators.\n\nMicrosoft's new Azure Sentinel service works in the same manner, except it's also deeply integrated with Microsoft's cloud services, such as Office 365 and the other Azure offerings, making it a go-to solution for companies running on Azure-first infrastructure.\n\nNonetheless, Azure Sentinel also supports importing data from a large number of third-party software solutions, and will also handle importing from any custom data streams in the Common Event Format (CEF).\n\nSo I use Azure Sentinel on my honeypot network. Cost wise they\u2019re undercutting competition by a pretty big margin, and the pace of innovation and third party integration puts it in \u2018oh my\u2019 group. #GossiMagicQuadrant pic.twitter.com/t0GDCGl4cC \u2014 Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) September 24, 2019\n\nMicrosoft announced Azure Sentinel in February this year, when it launched the cloud-based SIEM into a public preview, ahead of the RSA cyber-security conference.\n\nThe company said Sentinel's main feature was the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze incoming data and adapt to evolving threats.\n\nPay-as-you-go pricing is $2.46 per gigabyte (GB) of data analyzed by Azure Sentinel. Other pricing schemes are also available.\n\nFor more information, readers can check out Azure Sentinel's official documentation page.", "description": "Pricing starts at $2.46 per gigabyte (GB) of ingested data.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/02/28/b4ce3450-57e6-4823-8e93-cb7a7d3f51fc/thumbnail/770x578/11e3b44e28f06cb860d50a2f46c31e29/azure-sentinel-dashboard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
