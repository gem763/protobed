The same, for example, could be said about author and 2020 candidate Marianne Williamson\u2019s 100% spike to hit $3 million in third-quarter funding \u2014 an amount she first shared with Yahoo Finance. But at $10 million, Yang quietly just moved into the so-called top tier of candidates for the first time. It\u2019s just $1 million shy of the amount Harris\u2019 campaign brought in over the same quarter.\n\nEntrepreneur and 2020 hopeful Andrew Yang led all Democratic candidates in terms of the largest percent gain in fundraising from the second quarter to third quarter. So far, Sen. Bernie Sanders has raised the most on a dollar basis at $25 million. More\n\n\u201cThis grassroots fundraising total, with more than $6 million in the bank, ensures this campaign will have the funding to compete and outperform expectations through Super Tuesday and beyond,\u201d Zach Graumann, Yang\u2019s campaign manager, told the New York Times.\n\nYet, while the monetary victory is no doubt a giant shift in momentum for Yang\u2019s campaign \u2014 it hasn\u2019t yet been matched by an as large of a jump in Yang\u2019s polling. While his 3% polling is a large jump from the 1% in months past, according to a Real Clear Politics national average, it\u2019s still not enough to top Buttigieg or Harris in the so-called second tier of polling positions. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, along with Biden are currently in a polling league of their own as the only candidates to each top 15% on a national level.\n\nFrom left, Democratic presidential candidates Sen.
