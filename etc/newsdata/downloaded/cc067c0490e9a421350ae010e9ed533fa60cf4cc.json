As many as 9,000 badgers took longer than five minutes to die after being shot as part of culls so far this year, Professor Munro revealed. Professor Munro and 19 other vets, scientists and animal welfare campaigners wrote to Natural England to warn them that their culls are causing 'huge suffering' and are ineffective in reducing TB in cattle. The campaigners claimed that thousands of badgers were taking longer than five minutes to die after being shot, leading to 'immense pain'. The group also revealed that TB rates had increased in Gloucestershire, which is the first cull area. A freedom of information request showed how the number of new herds confirmed to have TB in the region rose from 10 in 2017 to 23 in 2018. The other areas where the cull is carried out include Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Wiltshire, Herefordshire, Cheshire and Somerset. Speaking to the BBC, Professor Munro said: 'The numbers are huge, they really are. If you look at the likelihood of not dying within five minutes of being shot, you are looking at 3,000 badgers having suffered immense pain at a minimum. 'It could be as high as 9,000. There is a huge issue of suffering in these badgers.'\n\nResearchers believe this could be linked to reduced competition and increased food availability as badgers are removed from the population.\n\nLead author of the study, PhD researcher Cally Ham, explained: 'Badgers spend a large proportion of the night foraging for food above ground, and as culling reduces the size of the population, competition for food will also be reduced.\n\n'We believe this accounts for the reduced activity levels, as well as bold individuals becoming obvious targets for culling and being quickly removed from the population.\n\n'Because culling partly relies on shooting badgers moving around at night, the fact that badgers were active for fewer hours per night could actually be undermining culling efforts to further control badger numbers.'\n\nProfessor Rosie Woodroffe, at ZSL's Institute of Zoology, added: 'In contrast, studies have shown that vaccination prompts no changes in badgers' ranging behaviour.'\n\nThe research group from ZSL's Institute of Zoology and Imperial's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis studied 67 badgers across 20 cattle farms in areas with and without farmer-led culling in Cornwall, collecting GPS collar data between 2013 and 2017.\n\nLast year the Government commissioned a review of its strategy for tackling bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in livestock amid ongoing controversy about badger culling to control the disease.\n\nMeasures to tackle the disease include cattle testing and movement controls, protective measures on farms, developing vaccines for cattle and badgers and culling badgers in 32 areas of England.\n\nThe independent review found farmers must do more to tackle the spread of tuberculosis between cattle, which is a bigger part of the problem than badgers.\n\nWhile it said that culling showed a 'real but modest effect' and was a judgement call for ministers, the review led by Sir Charles Godfray said poor take up of biosecurity measures and trading in high-risk livestock was hampering disease control.\n\nResearchers from London tracked 67 badgers in Cornwall over a period of years and found a dramatic increase in the amount of ground they covered in areas where the animals were culled. This raised the risk of them spreading tuberculosis to livestock, the experts said\n\nA badger being released from a trap. Campaigners say vaccinating the animals is a better solution than killing them\n\nA spokesman for the Badger Trust said: 'The latest research from ZSL shows that this mass destruction of a protected species could be resulting in perturbation, increasing the risk of TB spread in badgers and possibly cattle.'\n\nHe added: 'Badger vaccination is the most cost effective and humane way of reducing TB in badgers, that do not have the disease.\n\n'It also removes the risk of perturbation and brings farmers and wildlife protection groups together in a spirit of mutual respect, trust and confidence.\n\n'The Government should halt the culling of badgers and move to a national badger vaccination strategy.'\n\nA Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesman said: 'Bovine TB remains the greatest animal health threat to the UK, costing taxpayers over \u00a3100 million every year as well as causing devastation and distress for farmers and rural communities.\n\n'There is no single measure that will provide an easy answer to beating the disease and we are pursuing a range of interventions to eradicate it by 2038, including tighter cattle movement controls, regular testing and vaccinations.'", "description": "Scientists from the Zoological Society of London tracked almost 70 badgers in different parts of Cornwall and found they travelled further from their homes when numbers were reduced.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/09/19481446-0-image-a-6_1570610396128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
