Ozaukee County Sheriff Jim Johnson called it \u201cthe largest amount of DNA tests of any case in the state of Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nInvestigators combined DNA evidence on Hammerberg\u2019s body with public DNA databases to identify the killer\u2019s second cousin, Fox 6 reported. By using a family tree they were able to identify the man they contend killed Hammerberg: Philip J. Cross.\n\nJohnson said Cross\u2019 name had never come up in a list of suspects and he was not one of Hammerberg\u2019s friends or associates.\n\nBURNED REMAINS FOUND IN ILLINOIS IDENTIFIED AS WOMAN MISSING SINCE 2010\n\nThe night Hammerberg was killed, she had been at a party in Port Washington, a few miles from her home. Neil McGrath, special agent for the Wisconsin Department of Justice, said it\u2019s likely Hammerberg got into someone\u2019s car \u2013 either on her own or by force \u2013 during her walk home.\n\nOn his way home from a factory in Grafton, Cross and Hammerberg crossed paths, authorities say. But investigators will never know exactly what transpired: Cross died of a drug overdose in 2012.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Investigators have\u00a0gotten a big break in\u00a0the 1984 rape and murder of an 18-year-old Wisconsin woman, having identified a suspect\u00a0using open-source\u00a0DNA databases, authorities said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
