Borissov,\u201d the Manchester City striker wrote on Twitter.\n\nEarlier Sports Minister Krasen Kralev said the government would suspend relations with the BFU, including financial ties.\n\nThe Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) was not immediately available to comment. However, after Monday\u2019s match, it tried play down the incidents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite disappointing to focus on racism,\u201d BFU vice-president Yordan Lechkov said. \u201cIt\u2019s not serious to concentrate on that if there\u2019s a qualifier like this and we\u2019re playing against a team like England.\u201d\n\nUEFA had ordered the BFU to partially close the Vasil Levski stadium for England\u2019s visit after supporters were found guilty of racist behaviour in matches earlier this year.\n\nRacist chanting was heard from the stands and reported by England players to manager Gareth Southgate, with the referee informed and a public announcement made on two occasions.\n\nMost of the Bulgaria players and their coach said after the match they had not heard any abuse of the visiting team.\n\nCoach Krasimir Balakov said there had not been such racial incidents before and blamed England fans for being disrespectful to Bulgarian supporters.\n\n\u201cDuring the second half they used words against our fans which I find unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov leaves a European Union leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium July 1, 2019. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nThe BFU and a number of Bulgarian clubs have been fined by for racist abuse several times over the past few years.\n\nTroy Townsend, of soccer equality campaign group Kick It Out, urged UEFA to ban Bulgaria.\n\n\u201c(UEFA) have to take the strongest possible action and that for me, is to kick Bulgaria out of the European qualifiers. It\u2019s the only way people will take note of what they are doing to our black players.\u201d", "description": "Bulgarian Football Union's (BFU) president Borislav Mihaylov has turned down the prime minister's call to resign following racist abuse and monkey chants from Bulgaria fans towards black England players during their Euro 2020 qualifier.", "authors": ["Angel Krasimirov", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441089452&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0KW", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
