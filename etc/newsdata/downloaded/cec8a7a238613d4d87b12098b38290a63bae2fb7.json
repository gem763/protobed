Barcelona.\n\nMajor tournaments aside, there is no bigger soccer match in Spain \u2014 and perhaps the world \u2014 than Barcelona v. Madrid. But protests against the jailing of nine separatist leaders who led a 2017 independence referendum have been raging for five consecutive days, and Spain\u2019s soccer league made an almost unthinkable call.\n\nSpain\u2019s La Liga said \"exceptional circumstances beyond our control\u201d forced the postponement of the rivalry match scheduled for October 26. Barca said it had confidence its fans would \u201cexpress themselves in exemplary fashion,\" but were forced by the Spanish Football Federation to postpone the match.\n\nReuters reported a group of hundreds of thousands of marchers were expected to reach Barcelona on Friday. The city has already seen fierce protests and now will be joined by a massive group of reinforcements, who\u2019ve been on the move from all corners of Catalonia for days, chanting \u201cfreedom for political prisoners.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s Supreme Court sentenced the Catalan leaders to up to 13 years in prison on Monday, and protests and riots quickly followed. Protesters in Barcelona chanted \u201cthe streets will always be ours\u201d and reportedly tossed gasoline bombs and stones at police.\n\n\"We condemn violence,\" said Quim Torra, president of the Catalan region, according to BBC News. \"There is no reason nor justification for burning cars, nor any other vandalism.\"\n\nThe wealthy region of Catalonia has a complicated history with the rest of Spain, and F.C. Barcelona is entwined in that history. Catalonia has its own language and flag \u2014 a flag that\u2019s featured in the club\u2019s crest and is often displayed by fans at matches \u2014 and has complained for years about sending too much in taxes to the rest of the country. Amid that tension, F.C. Barcelona has been a steady symbol of Catalan pride, and for years, fans have chanted \u201cindependencia\u201d during matches.\n\nCover: Protesters match into the city on the fifth day of protests over the conviction of a dozen Catalan independence leaders in Barcelona, Spain, Friday, Oct. 18, 2019. Various flights into and out of the region are cancelled Friday due to a general strike called by pro-independence unions and five marches of tens of thousands from inland towns are expected converge in Barcelona's center on Friday afternoon for a mass protest with students to and workers who are on strike.
