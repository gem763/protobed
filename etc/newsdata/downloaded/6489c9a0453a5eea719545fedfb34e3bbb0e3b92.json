Though a Chinese newspaper said that the Chinese visit to the US farmlands had nothing to do with the trade discussions, those who have closely followed the recent talks could tell that this week\u2019s visit may have been encouraged by a goodwill action amid Trump accused Xi of not being true to his word after he apparently promised his peer to purchase US farm products at the latest G20 meeting, and put new tariffs on Chinese imports on China\u2019s failure to do so.\n\n\n\nShanghai\u2019s Composite slid 1.30% in the early hours of trading; the Hang Seng (-0.86%) extended losses.\n\n\n\nSovereign bonds gained, as gold spiked to $1520 an ounce on the back of limited risk appetite in Asia.\n\n\n\nSilver jumped to $18.35 an ounce, the highest since September 12.\n\n\n\nOil, energy stocks advance as Aramco recovery could take longer than thought.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX advanced 0.36%, as the preliminary PMI read hinted that the Australian economy may have expanded in September after last month\u2019s dip below the 50 levels rose worries of economic contraction despite the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) efforts to revive activity.\n\n\n\nGains in Sydney were led by energy stocks (+1.15%), as oil prices rose past 1% on news that the full production recovery in Aramco plants will likely take more than the ten weeks initially promised by executives.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the US strengthened its troops in Saudi Arabia as a response to escalating tensions with Iran amid last weekend\u2019s drone attacks on Aramco that erased nearly 5% of the global oil supply.\n\n\n\nThe temporary supply-side crisis in Saudi Arabia, which also revived geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, combined to the optimism of a possible interim trade deal between the US and China should continue giving support to the oil prices.\n\n\n\nWTI crude advanced to $59.40 a barrel on Monday, as Brent crude rose to $65.50.\n\n\n\nA sudden disruption in trade talks is the major downside risk to the up-trending oil prices.\n\n\n\nFTSE futures (-0.03%) were quiet in Asia, as the pound traded a touch below the 1.25 mark against the US dollar.\n\n\n\nThe FTSE is expected to open 3 points lower at 7342p.\n\n\n\nCable trades near 1.25 ahead of this week\u2019s Brexit negotiations in NY and Supreme Court decision\n\n\n\nPound traders are faced with two-sided volatility this week, as PM Boris Johnson flies to New York on Monday for the UN General Assembly. He will try to renegotiate a Brexit deal with key names including Donald Tusk, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Leo Varadkar. Although Johnson is not expected to resolve a more-than-three-year-old Brexit headache with his European peers to reach a comprehensive deal that could happen by the October 31st deadline, any positive or negative comments could impact the sterling up or down respectively.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision due this week, on whether Johnson\u2019s most controversial suspension of parliament was legal and whether British MPs could return to parliament before the initially announced five-week deadline, should be decisive in pound\u2019s overall direction this week.\n\n\n\nInvestors trimmed their net short speculative positions in sterling during the week to September 17th in anticipation of a further pound recovery, if MPs are allowed to return to parliament sooner than expected. Support to the pound\u2019s September rebound against the US dollar could be found at 1.2440, the minor 23.6% retracement, and 1.2350, the major 38.2% retracement.\n\n\n\nPMI in focus, as the Fed continues pumping liquidity to ease fears of renewed jump in short-term borrowing costs\n\n\n\nPreliminary PMI data in the US and the Eurozone could hint at a slight improvement in economic activity in September on Monday.\n\n\n\nBut the US dollar remains under the pressure of the liquidity crisis in the repo markets. The Fed announced that it would conduct overnight repo operations of at least $75 billion until October 10 to ease worries of a renewed hike in short-term borrowing costs in the upcoming Treasury auctions.\n\n\n\nThe US 10-year yield retreated below 1.72% after hitting 1.90% a week earlier.\n\n\n\nThe euro rebounded from the 1.10 support against the US dollar on Friday, and the pair advanced to 1.1025 in Asia on the back of broad-based weakness in the greenback.\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nto open 3 points lower at 7342\n\n\n\nto open 30 points lower at 12438\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
