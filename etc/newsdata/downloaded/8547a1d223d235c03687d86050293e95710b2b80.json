How would the state sector absorb another almost 600,000 pupils?\n\nIt would be like adding the school population of Wales - with estimates of an extra \u00a33.5bn per year on state school budgets.\n\nBut the fact that this motion has gone ahead shows the underlying disquiet about the lack of social mobility and widening inequalities.\n\nAnd private schools have become the symbolic battleground.\n\n'Ideological distraction'\n\nThe Independent Schools Council said parents would be \"rightly worried\" at what Labour was proposing, saying it \"put politics before the interests of children\" and was potentially a breach of the European Convention of Human Rights.\n\n\"The move is an attack on the rights and freedoms of parents to make choices over the education of their children,\" said its chief executive Julie Robinson.\n\n\"This decision is an ideological distraction from dealing with the real problems in education.\n\n\"We all want to see more funding for state schools and greater support for underperforming pupils, which is precisely why we encourage all schools to work together in the interests of every child.\"\n\nThe Independent Schools Association said some private schools undoubtedly needed to do more to justify their charitable status.\n\nBut it said absorbing private schools into the state sector would push up class sizes and potentially leave a \"devastating\" hole in special needs provision currently not paid for by the taxpayer.\n\n\"If integration occurred, teachers in the private sector wouldn't choose to transfer into the state sector, even when pay and pensions are higher in state schools, as if often the case,\" said its chief executive Neil Roskilly.\n\n\"There's already a major teacher shortage that can't be addressed.\"\n\nOn the second day of its conference, Labour also unveiled a plan to scrap Ofsted and replace it with a new school inspection system.", "description": "Party members vote to commit to integrate private schools into the state sector.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DB42/production/_108903165_728b28c3-1be1-4f60-8162-f7b002c1f6ba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
