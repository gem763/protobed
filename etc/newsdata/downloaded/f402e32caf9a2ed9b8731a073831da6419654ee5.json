If successful, MPs could force Johnson to withdraw his deal and attempt to hold a general election instead.\n\nThe EU is poised to grant the UK a three month extension to the Brexit deadline if Johnson's deal fails to pass through Parliament this week, moving exit day to February 1, the Times reports.\n\nJohnson's plan to take the UK out of the EU on October 31 was derailed on Saturday after MPs passed a law which means Johnson must ask European leaders for Brexit to be delayed until early next year.\n\nOliver Letwin, the MP behind the plan, said a delay would act as an \"insurance policy\" to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal at the end of October.\n\nUK could remain in EU customs union or hold a second referendum\n\nIn the meantime, Johnson's Conservative government on Monday will try to avoid another delay by securing a House of Commons majority for the new deal. Johnson has said he would rather \"be dead in a ditch\" than delay Brexit.\n\nThe government wants to hold a \"meaningful vote\" on the Brexit deal on Monday, with projections suggesting that there is a slim House of Commons majority in favour of his revised agreement with Brussels.\n\nHowever, House of Commons Speaker Bercow is expected to block such a vote taking place, on the grounds that the government cannot table the same motion twice in the same session of parliament.\n\nThe real action is set to get underway on Tuesday when the government holds the first votes on its Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB.)\n\nWAB is separate from the Brexit deal itself, but must secure parliamentary approval in order for Britain's exit from the EU to be recognised in law. Johnson wants to get it through Parliament as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, opposition MPs plan to use WAB to make key amendments to the Brexit deal.\n\nThe biggest headache for the government is an amendment which seeks to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU after Brexit. A similar amendment was defeated by just three votes earlier this year.\n\nRetaining a customs union with the EU would breach Johnson's biggest red line of removing the UK from the EU's customs territory. It also would inhibit the UK's ability to sign its own free trade deals.\n\nHowever, a customs union would guarantee the continuation of tariff-free trade and reduce the number of checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU after Brexit.\n\nLabour's Shadow Security Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds on Sunday evening told BBC Radio 4 that the opposition party would instruct its MPs to vote for the amendment. \"A customs union is going to be one of the amendments that comes through and that is something that is going to have a very good chance of getting a majority,\" Nick said.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, that props up Johnson's government, was also considering supporting the amendment, according to reports, on the basis that it would allow the whole of the UK to have the same customs relationship with the EU after Brexit.\n\nThe staunchly unionist party strongly opposes Johnson's deal with the EU as if implemented, it would force Northern Ireland to continue following EU customs rules after Brexit, while the rest of the UK would not.\n\nHowever, DUP MP Jim Shannon on Monday morning ruled out the prospect of his party voting for a customs union, however.\n\nHe told Sky News: \"We are clear where we stand on the customs union, it's something we cannot support.\"\n\nAnother amendment that MPs are set to table calls offers to support Johnson's deal - as long as the government puts it to the public for a second referendum. It is spearheaded by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.\n\nThis amendment has a smaller chance of success, as a significant number of Labour MPs remain opposed to a new Brexit referendum, or what some campaigners call a \"People's Vote.\"\n\nThe official People's Vote campaign decided not to push for a parliamentary vote on referendum amendment to take place on Saturday, as it was not confident that it had the numbers to win.", "description": "MPs are planning to push for a second referendum and attach a customs union to Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7961/4c3cc53a5c4c49ce8a17d48e2f59bee7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
