The switch has geopolitical implications that will be felt as far away as Washington because the Solomons are directly between Australia and the US and were the site of fierce battles during World War II.\n\nDwindling allies\n\nChina Taiwan Solomon Islands Australia More\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nHome to 660,000 people, the Solomons were easily Taiwan's largest remaining ally in the Pacific. Its economy relies on agriculture, fishing and forestry, and the country has a wealth of undeveloped mineral resources. It also has access to airfields and deepwater ports dating to World War II.\n\nNow only 16 countries recognize Taiwan, including five small Pacific nations. The Marshall Islands and Palau have close ties with the US and are unlikely to switch allegiance any time soon, but experts say Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu could soon switch.\n\nJames Batley, a researcher at the Australian National University and a former Australian high commissioner in the Solomon Islands, told the Associated Press that the move didn't come as a surprise.\n\nRead more: China is 'weaponizing capital' \u2014 and it's keeping the head of the US Navy awake at night\n\n\"The sense in Solomon Islands is that there are significant resources on offer here from China, and they want to move with the times and on the side of history,\" he said.\n\nBut he said the Solomons needs to be careful not to get into serious debt to China, particularly as, even before the switch, it was looking to take out big loans to fund infrastructure projects including a hydroelectric dam.\n\nAnne-Marie Brady, an expert on China at the University of Canterbury, said the blow wasn't as severe now as it might have been in the past because Taipei has built unofficial relations with dozens of countries and the EU as part of a more pragmatic approach to its diplomacy.\n\nBrady told the AP that the Solomons may also benefit from being able to better balance its relations with a number of larger countries, including China, the US, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n'Reassessing our commitment'", "description": "Taiwan lost its largest ally in the Pacific after the Solomon Islands confirmed it would recognize China.
