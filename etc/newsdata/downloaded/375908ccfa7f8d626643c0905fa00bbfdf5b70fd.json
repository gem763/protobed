The deaths were reported in California, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota and Oregon.\n\nIllinois has reported an eighth death related to the outbreak, state epidemiologist Jennifer Layden said on a conference call with reporters. The CDC has not yet confirmed that death.\n\nLayden said Illinois has now reported 69 cases, up from 52 a week ago, and the state continues to get reports of new cases daily.\n\nDonald Trump said last week his administration will propose banning thousands of flavors used in e-cigarettes to combat a recent surge in underage vaping.\n\nAll patients in the recent outbreak currently under investigation had used an electronic cigarette or other vaping device. Doctors say the illnesses resemble an inhalation injury, with the lungs apparently reacting to a caustic substance.\n\nTwo-thirds of the cases involved 18- to 34-year-olds. Most are men.\n\nSome of the first cases appeared in April. CDC hasn\u2019t said when people most people got sick.", "description": "US officials say there have been seven deaths from lung-related illnesses tied to the devices, with no sign outbreak is easing", "authors": ["News Agencies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cc781682b8fccf264b0eeb90367f87a4d0ce7a5/0_256_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77eb21ef4ec8f4d63a6bafc3a11b959d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
