I mean, do we keep going?\u2019\n\nAs Steph accepted that the souffles weren\u2019t going to come out how she wanted, she cried and admitted to the cameras: \u2018I just feel a bit stupid. It couldn\u2019t have gone much worse, could it?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith didn\u2019t hold back their thoughts on the culinary disaster either, branding the botched dish \u2018soups\u2019 and \u2018pancakes\u2019.\n\nSteph cried during the final of Bake Off (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nOh no! Disaster strikes for poor Steph. #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/zvvKtYskp2 \u2014 British Bake Off (@BritishBakeOff) October 29, 2019\n\nSteph\u2019s souffles didn\u2019t turn out how she\u2019d hoped (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018The biscuits are too thick,\u2019 observed Paul. \u2018That\u2019s hardly been in the oven, look. They\u2019ve had problems with the souffle from the start.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve beaten the whole thing to death.\u2019\n\nPrue wasn\u2019t so harsh though, adding: \u2018Because those ingredients are so delicious, it tastes lovely. It\u2019s like eating a sauce.\u2019\n\nAs a result of Steph\u2019s nightmare mishap, she placed third, behind her competitors Alice and David.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 she told Prue and Paul.\n\nViewers were also in bits at Steph\u2019s soggy souffles, with one writing on Twitter: \u2018When Steph cried because her souffl\u00e9s didn\u2019t rise. It took a lot of strength to not cry with her.\u2019\n\nEchoing a similar sentiment, another added: \u2018Not gonna lie but I just let out a little tear for Steph with her souffles.\u2019\n\nThe Great British Bake Off is available for catch-up on 4OD.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
