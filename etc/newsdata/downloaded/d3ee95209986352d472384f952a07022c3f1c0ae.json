We\u2019re not going to allow them to stay on our streets, to show up in our communities, to be used against us in our synagogues, our churches, our mosques, our Walmarts, our public places.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll countries have video games. All countries struggle with mental health. All countries deal with hatred. But only America has more guns than human beings \u2014 390 million firearms in a country of 329 million people \u2014 which kill nearly 40,000 people every year,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s why, as president, I would institute a mandatory buyback of every assault weapon in America.\u201d\n\nThe former Texas congressman has made gun control a focal point of his campaign since the mass shooting.\n\nClick here for more from Washington Examiner.", "description": "Beto O\u2019Rourke repeated his pledge to initiate a mandatory buyback of assault weapons if he is elected president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/10/694940094001_6070979950001_6071058051001-vs.jpg"}
