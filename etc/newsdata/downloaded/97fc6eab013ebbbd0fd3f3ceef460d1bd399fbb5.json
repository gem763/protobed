Mueller III\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, episodes Democrats will explore further during a hearing Tuesday with former Trump campaign official Corey Lewandowski and other ex-Trump aides.\n\nAdditional potential impeachment articles being explored by the committee could focus on hush-money payments to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump, and allegations that the president has used his public office to benefit his private business, according to the people familiar with the discussions.\n\nSeveral people close to the investigation cautioned that the articles may never be drafted at all, particularly given Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s reluctance to move forward. But the behind-the-scenes planning reflects a growing desire among House Democrats to build a public case against Trump \u2014 and soon \u2014 even if there is no chance the Senate would convict him.\n\nThe committee is scheduled to vote Thursday on new investigative procedures the panel will use \u201cto determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment with respect to President Donald J. Trump,\u201d the resolution reads. Similar procedures have been used in the impeachment of previous U.S. presidents.\n\nTrump \u201chas trampled the Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a committee member who has drafted his own articles, threatened to introduce them and then backed off after learning of the panel\u2019s plans to eventually craft its own. \u201cThere is just so much you could go after. It\u2019s going to be refining it down to the most salient.\u201d\n\nThe public drama will unfold as the country moves toward a hotly contested 2020 campaign and Democratic hopefuls jockey for the presidential nomination \u2014 one of the reasons some Judiciary Committee Democrats say they fear time is running out and want to be ready. The party\u2019s liberal base, most of its presidential candidates and a majority of House Democrats \u2014 134 of the 235 \u2014 endorse impeachment, putting pressure on Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, Daniel Schwarz, a spokesman for the Judiciary Committee Democrats, played down any discussions about articles of impeachment, reaffirming the panel\u2019s public position that \u201cthe committee is focused on its investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s work on its investigation is ongoing, but there have been no decisions made,\u201d he said. \u201cAny suggestion that such articles have already been drafted or that the committee\u2019s work is already concluded is categorically false.\u201d\n\nCongressional Democrats plan to launch inquiry into Trump\u2019s alleged role in scheme to silence affair accusations\n\nYet increasingly there\u2019s a sense among House Democrats that impeaching Trump is inevitable \u2014 even among some who do not want to proceed with it.\n\n\u201cI think the train has left the station, and at some point there\u2019s going to be a vote on articles of impeachment, and that\u2019s a concern for members like myself who represent moderate districts,\u201d said Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), who is seeking reelection in a district Trump won by 15 percentage points in 2016.\n\nThe disagreement between the panel and the leadership over impeachment sets up a possible showdown between Pelosi and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). The committee has always coordinated its activities with the speaker, and those close to the panel say it is unlikely it would ever defy her wishes and advance articles without her consent.\n\nPelosi has remained a skeptic of impeaching the president, noting that a majority of Americans oppose the move. She has continued to frame the issue both in public and private as an ongoing investigation of Trump rather than official impeachment proceedings, messaging that conflicts with the committee\u2019s and has created confusion for lawmakers and the public.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what the chairman said,\u201d Pelosi told reporters Monday when asked whether she agreed with Nadler\u2019s assertion that the panel was already in an official impeachment proceeding. \u201cI do know we are on the path [of investigation], and that includes the possibility of legislation or impeachment.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats in Trump districts resist liberal pressure on impeachment\n\nThe committee is keen on exploring Trump\u2019s alleged involvement in payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, which could be the basis for one article. Several on the panel say they believe there is enough evidence to establish Trump as a co-conspirator on campaign finance charges that sent his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to prison.\n\nTrump\u2019s stonewalling of Congress and ignoring of congressional subpoenas would almost certainly make up another charge, according to lawmakers and aides. Trump has blocked more than 20 investigations, according to a Washington Post analysis, forcing the Democrats to turn to the courts for help.\n\nSome lawmakers, including Judiciary Committee member Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), also have been pushing the panel to make the emoluments piece part of the list, according to some of the individuals. Reports about the military and Vice President Pence staying in Trump hotels at taxpayers\u2019 expense smack of corruption and will resonate with voters, these Democrats say.\n\nThe panel is considering a subcommittee hearing on these matters in coming weeks, two people said.\n\n\u201cThe American people understand what it means to rip off the government for your private business interests,\u201d said Raskin, who declined to comment on discussions about articles of impeachment. \u201cThat\u2019s where we are. The president has converted the American government into an instrument of self-enrichment.\u201d\n\nThe subject is a sensitive one for the committee and House Democratic leadership. Even House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) appeared confused Wednesday about the precise nature of the panel\u2019s work \u2014 and whether impeachment was a real possibility. Asked by reporters whether the committee was in an official impeachment inquiry, he said no and gave an answer that he was later forced to clarify.\n\n\u201cI strongly support Chairman Nadler and the Judiciary Committee Democrats as they proceed with their investigation \u2018to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House,\u2019 as the resolution states,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt is critical that Congress have access to all of the relevant facts, and we will follow those facts wherever they lead, including impeachment.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a group of centrist House Democrats are growing nervous about the prospects of being forced to vote on impeachment. Several Democratic freshmen, many from districts Trump won in 2016, confronted Nadler at a Wednesday morning meeting to discuss the arc of the House investigations.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Look, over the next six months, I would much rather see the Democrats be the party of lowering prescription drug costs, not the party of impeachment,\u201d said Brindisi, who was in the meeting. \u201cHis message back was that the committee is doing their due diligence right now, and he did not commit one way or the other where the investigation would lead.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s unclear is whether the new fall focus will change public opinion, reversing numbers in which a majority of Americans have opposed impeachment. That view has remained largely unchanged since a June survey conducted before Mueller testified to Congress.\n\nBut members of the Judiciary Committee, many of whom are eager to impeach Trump, say they have a job to do \u2014 no matter what the polls say.\n\n\u201cI think this is one of those moments where we have to lead, we have to look at the evidence, look at the law, do what the Constitution requires us to do, and the politics will take care of itself,\u201d said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.). \u201cI don\u2019t think you can make a determination because you think it is politically disadvantageous.\u201d\n\nCicilline also declined to comment on discussions about articles.\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report.", "description": "The discussions, closely held and preliminary, include a range of allegations.
