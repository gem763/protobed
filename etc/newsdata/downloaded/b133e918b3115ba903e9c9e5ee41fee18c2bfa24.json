They\u2019re last in total yards (1,467), last in first downs (92), last in passing yards (1,020) and 31st in several other categories.\n\nBut they\u2019re apparently open to trading away the only player on their roster who has generated yards, just months after he was signed to a big free-agent deal.\n\nReport: Jets \u2018receptive\u2019 to trading Le\u2019Veon Bell\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOn Tuesday, Albert Breer of The MMQB tweeted that the Jets are \u201ccertainly receptive\u201d to the idea of trading running back Le\u2019Veon Bell, but the team hadn\u2019t gotten any calls on him from other teams that might be interested.\n\nBell currently has over 200 more yards from scrimmage than his nearest teammate, totaling 349 yards on 109 carries (that is a subpar 3.2 yards per carry) and 187 yards on 32 catches. He has two touchdowns and a 2-point conversion (the Jets have scored only seven offensive touchdowns this season).\n\nThe Jets are reportedly 'receptive' to the idea of trading RB Le'Veon Bell. (AP/Matt Rourke)\n\nReceiver Jamison Crowder has 326 yards on 35 catches and one carry.\n\nThe NFL trade deadline is 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday, and Connor Hughes of The Athletic tweeted that the Jets, who traded defensive lineman Leonard Williams to the Giants on Monday, are in fire-sale mode and teams have been calling general manager Joe Douglas to see what the price would be for Bell. The price is high, both in dollars and compensation for the Jets.\n\nBell signed a 4-year deal in March\n\nAs you very likely recall, Bell sat out the 2018 season rather than play a second straight year on a franchise tag with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWhen free agency began, he quickly signed with the Jets on a four-year, $52.5 million deal that included $35 million guaranteed.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen New York fired Mike Maccagnan as general manager after signing Bell, there were reports that head coach Adam Gase didn\u2019t want Bell, not at the amount of money it took to sign the two-time All-Pro.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Could the Bell-Jets marriage be a short one?", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4toJOmA7cB.p85_JhPVhVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OlAnf2ZsmMCnF.Y27FuHig--~B/aD0yNzUzO3c9NDEyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/81847610-fa6a-11e9-958f-389ba4954e12", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
