The shovel\u2019s contents would then be thrown into the raging fire. Another reason to eat before you set off!\n\nSome trains had hair salons on board\n\nIn the 1930s, \u2018The Big Four\u2019, the London North Eastern, London Midland & Scottish, Great Western and Southern Railways competed with each other to capture the PR headlines with glamorous sounding train names and ever-increasing average and top speeds.\n\n\n\nThe GWR\u2019s Brunel created what is known as the Billiard Table route between Paddington and Swindon with easy gradients and as few curves as possible. This enabled them to boast their \u2018Cheltenham Flyer' as being the world\u2019s fastest train covering the 77 miles between Swindon to Paddington in 67 minutes in 1931.\n\nThese trains were one-offs in so far as all other trains were regulated out of their way to ensure punctuality. The on-train facilities ranged between a freshly cooked lunch or dinner to a hair dressing salon.\n\nA train full of live chickens once toured the UK\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn 1910, on behalf of the National Poultry Organisation Society, the Great Western Railway ran a poultry exhibition train to South Wales to educate locals in the art of poultry keeping to help relieve food shortages.\n\nThe train was repeated in April 1913 to North Wales and in 1915 to England's south-western counties.\n\nThe carriages contained live chickens plus other attractions including an egg-barometer, chicken charts and diagrams designed with the aim to educate visitors.\n\nThe fastest steam train record from 1938 still stands\n\nOn 3rd July 1938, the London North Eastern Railway\u2019s streamlined A4 Class locomotive \u2018Mallard\u2019 reached 126mph going downhill between Grantham and Peterborough setting a new world steam speed record which still stands.\n\nThis train was billed as a high speed brake test by engineers to make sure the attempt was not foiled or suffered advance publicity in case the attempt failed.\n\nThe Hogwarts Express was based on a real train\n\nThere are several claims as to what is universally the most famous train. Some of which include the Flying Scotsman, the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph or The Mallard, built in 1938 and STILL in the record books today as the world's fastest steam train.\n\nBut undeniably one of the most prominent in recent years is the Harry Potter Hogwarts Express.\n\nIt might be a fictional train but it was actually based on a 1920s design Great Western Railway Hall Class locomotive with some 1960s British Railways carriages.\n\nIf you look closely in the films, you'll see it had a huge headlight on the front of it to create a highly visual effect in the films.\n\nSome of the most famous scenes of the fantasy train were shot on the Glenfinnan viaduct between Fort William and Mallaig.\n\nThe UK has some record breaking tunnels\n\nThe longest tunnel in the UK is the Severn Tunnel (above) under the Bristol Channel and is 4 \u00bc miles long and opened in 1886.\n\nThe longest single track tunnel is the just over two mile long Ffestiniog Tunnel in north Wales and most of the tunnel sides are bare rock.\n\nQueen Victoria refused to travel above 40mph - but train staff ignored that wish when it came to her funeral\n\nQueen Victoria died at Osbourne House, Cowes, on the Isle of Wight and the state funeral included her extended European regal family.\n\nHer coffin was carried across the Solent to Gosport station on Saturday 2 February 1901 but was delayed by fog. The coffin was to be placed in a specially decorated Great Western Railway saloon ready for an 0845 departure to London Victoria timed to take two hours.\n\nThe train\u2019s departure was delayed and railway officials had to decide whether the Late Queen\u2019s instruction that her train should not exceed 40mph should be adhered to.\n\nShe was also due to be conveyed from Victoria to Paddington by Gun Carriage and then by train to Windsor at 1.32pm.\n\nIf the 40mph instruction was to be adhered to, the funeral would be late so the railway authorities decided, given the Queen would never know, or could complain, that the train could run at speeds up to 70mph to recover time so as not to delay the funeral.\n\nLondon's first mainline railway trains didn't have roofs or windows - unless you were in First Class\n\nLondon\u2019s first main line railway was opened in stages between Euston to Birmingham between 1837 and 1838 estimated to cost of \u00a32.5million but cost double in the end.\n\nA cushion was recommended to absorb the \u2018considerable vibration\u2019, a damp gauze type cloth was advised to cover your face to avoid breathing in smoke, soot and cinders. Only 1st class carriages had a roof and windows.\n\nYou were also advised to board the train as soon as possible and take a seat away from the carriage side and face BACKWARDS.\n\nLondon and Birmingham once had different time zones\n\nPassengers missed trains because Birmingham\u2019s local time was seven minutes different to London\u2019s.\n\nThis was of no consequence prior to longer rail journeys being made possible when stagecoaches were used averaging nine mph.\n\nThe London and Birmingham Railway issued two railway timetables, one for the time difference at their stations and one for the actual train times!\n\nInventions such as the electric telegraph enabled stations to synchronise clocks and thus time was unified across the country.\n\nAnimals used to travel by train - but often escaped\n\nCircuses and farm animals used to be moved by special trains as this was the only real method of transporting them and it was not uncommon for them to escape.\n\nIn 1842 there were reports of a body on the line at Camden so railway staff made their way to the location to find an alligator on the track. A year later, a burglar was seen in the goods shed at Camden but when the police cornered him, they found not a thief but a bear.\n\nIn 1874 a London to Liverpool goods train conveyed a tiger in a caged wagon. When the train arrived at Rugby it was discovered that the tiger was missing and suspected to be in the Weedon area near Northampton.\n\nNight Steam Locomotive Foreman Thomas Bartrum was tasked with capturing said tiger and he dispatched a steam locomotive with a station porter to search for the tiger which had been seen roaming in a field by the railway. Shortly after the tiger was seen, it chased the porter up a telegraph pole.\n\nMr Bartrum took another steam engine to Weedon but this time armed with a gun and killed the animal from the steam locomotive footplate.", "description": "Rail expert shares incredible facts ahead of new Yesterday series Steam Train Britain, which airs Thursdays at 8pm", "authors": ["Dave Masters", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20640924.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Copy-of-Untitled-Design-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
