Not be like anyone else forcing anyone on us. He just believes in the talent he has, that they are right. He\u2019ll support them through that whole thing. Honestly he is a lovely man and I will remember that.\u2019\n\nCan Max and Harvey win X Factor: Celebrity? (Picture: ITV)\n\nMax and Harvey have been singing together since they were seven-years-old and were previously signed to Disney\u2019s record label. Their past experience and social media following (8 million fans and growing) has inevitably sparked a flurry of critics claiming they have an \u2018unfair advantage\u2019, but the duo insist they\u2019re got just as much to prove as anyone else.\n\n\u2018We have loving fans that support us and would love to support us through this whole thing and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be voting for us but everyone else has this mainstream TV like Jenny Ryan [from The Chase] and Martin Bashir.\u2019 Harvey hit back.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know, everyone else has been brokered to the whole country whereas we have sort of stayed to one demographic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We haven\u2019t been released to the public yet, if you want to put it that way, when people see us for the first time they can decide if they want to vote for us or not but I feel like everyone is on a level playing ground to be honest.\u2019\n\nMax agreed: \u2018The competing aspect is very different for us, we\u2019ve never competed with anyone else before.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a very different type of performing, you feel like if you haven\u2019t given everything that you\u2019ve got, you might as well have not done it. You are going for an end goal, and that end goal is to get a record contract.\u2019\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity kicks off tonight at 8.35pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
