He apologised.\n\nBoth men say that they are driven less by personal glory and more by what their achievements do to promote Colombia on the world stage.\n\nCabal hopes that they can inspire a new generation of tennis players from the South American country.\n\n\u201cWe try to make tennis history or tradition in Colombia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are the first ones and hopefully it\u2019s the beginning of a few more.\u201d", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah were just 11 when their coach told them they were playing doubles together \u2014 two", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/bfeee7_boyhood-foes-world-tennis-champs-colombian-duo-are-win-straight-grand-slams-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
