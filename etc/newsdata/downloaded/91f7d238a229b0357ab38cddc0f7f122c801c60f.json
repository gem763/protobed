The vision of past leaders kept New Yorkers in town and captured the imaginations of millions from around the world who came here to \u201cmake it.\u201d In the Video Op-Ed above, Mara Gay, a native New Yorker who has reported on the streets of this city for seven years, questions where all that vision is today. She argues that New York\u2019s current leaders need to bring big ambition and hustle to serve their residents. She supplies ideas of what vision could look like to a mayor whose reluctant homecoming offers dim hope for the city. New Yorkers, she says, deserve more.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a New York story \u2014 it\u2019s a trend in many cities around the world, where broad public programs are pushed aside for narrow corporate interests and where transformative polices are as hard to come by as affordable rents.", "description": "The city was built on big ideas, but lately the vision seems smaller.", "authors": ["Mara Gay", "Tala Schlossberg", "Nayeema Raza", "Video By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/26/autossell/07op-mara-newyork/07op-mara-newyork-facebookJumbo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
