Despite the fact that the first four paragraphs of my Catalina review were an argument that you should hold off on updating your Mac until you know for sure your apps will work, I still don\u2019t feel I was strenuous enough.\n\nSome users missed the memo that 32-bit apps are finally getting left behind. Others didn\u2019t realize that Apple transition from iTunes to Apple Music would burn off a critical backend file format that other DJ apps depended on.\n\nYet more people didn\u2019t realize that they would need to set aside a solid hour to click approval boxes for apps requesting access to newly-restricted parts of your computer. Many people made jokes about the bad old days of Windows Vista and its pop-up boxes. I\u2019m just going to indulge myself and include one here:\n\nThis tweet brings to mind a classic Mac vs PC commercial making fun of Windows for nearly the same issue. It\u2019s worth a watch if only because it\u2019s really nice to remember a time when Apple didn\u2019t take itself so damn seriously:\n\nAt this point, you are probably tempted to rail at Apple for screwing this up. I could see a case that it hasn\u2019t handled the transition to the new security model in Catalina very elegantly, for sure. But when it comes to app compatibility, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to blame Apple, but I have a maybe surprising reason: I don\u2019t want us to be quite so dependent.\n\nAt the risk of being an I-told-you-so kind of person, I\u2019m just going to repeat what I said in the Catalina review again. You probably depend on your Mac or PC for \u201creal work,\u201d and so updating on day one could threaten that real work \u2014 literally threaten your livelihood. It\u2019s better to wait and see how things shake out, to let other people experience the problems and report them.\n\nTelling people not to upgrade to the new OS for a few weeks used to be so common that it sounds weird to emphasize it so much. But somewhere in the past decade the yearly updates for both iOS (and, to a lesser extent, Android) lulled us into a false sense of complacency.\n\nOn mobile platforms, you wanted to update right away because the new updates were generally stable, got you access to cool new features, and many of your favorite apps took advantage of those new features fairly early on. It was low risk, high reward.\n\nBut this year, iOS 13 has proven to be pretty buggy. Heck, everything has been pretty buggy this year. Windows 10 had a \u201cMay update\u201d that is still not ready for prime time as of October. iPadOS is still sending my keyboard to random corners of the screen. And Catalina, as I have said, isn\u2019t a great day-one update.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that Microsoft thinks Windows 10 May 2019 Update is ready for broad deployment when it\u2019s not even ready for the company\u2019s flagship laptop. Surface Book 2 is still blocked from installing 1903. https://t.co/gTL71fVeKv \u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren) September 28, 2019\n\nWith iOS, I think that it\u2019s fair to expect more stability \u2014 Apple exerts so much control over the platform that the likelihood of apps breaking on a new update is relatively small. The more locked down an OS is, the more you should have a expectation that it works like an appliance and the more annoyed you have a right to be when it doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut the Mac is different. So is Windows. These are open platforms, where anybody is free to make and distribute software what works on them without asking permission from the companies that create the operating systems (except, well, that\u2019s changing a bit with notarization on the Mac, but stay with me).\n\nCommand Line is The Verge\u2019s daily newsletter about personal tech.

Eternal backwards compatibility is a recipe for stagnation and confusion \u2014 a lesson Microsoft seems determined to try to relearn every four or five years. Apple was right to leave 32-bit apps behind. It was right to tighten up security a bit on the Mac. It was right to put iTunes out to pasture \u2014 though on that last one it could have probably done a better job giving developers a heads up on the unintended consequences.\n\nWhat I\u2019m arguing is that one of the prices of using a powerful, relatively open platform is that sometimes things break and that\u2019s okay. The alternatives are worse: you end up with something completely managed, something complete stagnant, or something completely boring.\n\nSo don\u2019t yell at Apple or Microsoft or Google when apps break on new versions of their OS. Doing so just reifies the idea that they are our benevolent overlords and takes away some of our own power. Yell at them when their own software breaks \u2014 trust me, it happens often enough that you\u2019ll never lack for moments of catharsis.\n\nI recently turned off auto-updates for apps on my phones. It has forced me to actually look at what these apps are doing and promising \u2014 and in some cases made me realize I don\u2019t want them installed on my phone at all.\n\nThis is the part where I say that you should also turn off auto-updates for your operating system, but I\u2019m balking. Because there are some auto-updates that are critical, the kind that fix security holes and improve your privacy. The world is a better place when more people have the latest, most secure software installed. I think of it a little like herd immunity.\n\nI\u2019m torn. This is the part where I\u2019m supposed to make sense of it all and give you some advice, but I can\u2019t do that. I am turning off auto-updates myself because I want to know more what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not, and what\u2019s new across my computers and apps. But I\u2019m also the kind of person who pays attention to such things. I don\u2019t think everybody should have to.\n\nMore from The Verge\n\n+ Spotify rolls out Siri support and new Apple TV app\n\nPro tip: instead of appending \u201con Spotify\u201d to your request, you can lead with it. As in \u201cHey Siri, Spotify The Ramones.\u201d It turns Spotify into a verb, like Googling for something. I\u2019m frankly shocked Spotify hasn\u2019t figured out this was a marketing move it could have made years ago.\n\nEven so, the extra word grates. You can set Spotify as the default on both Alexa and the Google Assistant (and Bixby!). Apple\u2019s olive branch here is not very much. Call me when I\u2019m allowed to set another email app as the default.\n\n+ iPadOS review: 50 percent more computer\n\nApple finally had the courage to make iPadOS a little complicated. In some places I think it succeeded, in others I think it failed. The most disappointing part was text editing, where Apple\u2019s attempts to make things more intuitive just made them worse.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t get over how punitive it is for Apple to refuse to include multi-user support. Lots of families share iPads!\n\n+ macOS Catalina review: transition period\n\nI\u2019ve said this on Twitter but couldn\u2019t find a good way to really work it into the review: in the future, I think we\u2019ll look at Catalina as the foundation of a new era for the Mac. I just don\u2019t know what that era looks like. Renaissance? Shift to iPad apps? Beginning of a long, slow decline?\n\nIt\u2019s setting up for the next chapter, but we don\u2019t know where the plot is going.\n\n+ Apple confirms macOS Catalina update is a big problem for DJs who relied on iTunes\n\nHere\u2019s one reason why it\u2019s a good idea to wait, at least if you depend on the iTunes library. Also, a lot of people are running into problems with 32-bit apps, which are no longer supported.\n\n+ Oops: Apple may have accidentally revealed a Sleep app for the Apple Watch\n\n+ PS4 Remote Play will fully support Android this week\n\nLegit \u201cfinally\u201d on this, the longest-running, silliest exclusive of the modern mobile era. Instead of only working on Xperia phones, it will work on any Android phone. It already did so on iPhones and iPads.\n\n+ Amazon updates the Fire HD 10 with a faster processor and USB-C\n\nThese are a pretty darn good deal for $149, even though you should know going in that it won\u2019t have easy access to every single app you probably want but it should have most. If you can afford more than twice the price, the new iPad is more than twice as good. If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to spend too much on a knock-around tablet keep a close eye for reviews of this one.\n\n+ The Kindle is getting a Kids Edition bundle for younger readers\n\nA Kindle with full access to kid-friendly content is a way better idea than a cheap, disposable tablet with the same. Or at least as good. Too bad it\u2019s only the basic one for now a future software update will bring it to better ones in January:", "description": "This year, iOS 13 has proven to be pretty buggy.
