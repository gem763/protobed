In other words, Google devices typically get giant upgrades like Android 10 first, and you have to sit and be envious until you get your shot\u2014possibly months after the fact \u2014 if you splurged for a Samsung or Huawei device, to name a few.\n\nOwners of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e smartphones now have a shot to try out \u201cAndroid 10.\u201d I put that in quotes, as you\u2019re really getting a chance to sign up for the beta for One UI 2.0 \u2014 Samsung\u2019s customised UI that it built on the back of stock Android.\n\nTo get started, pull up the Samsung Members app. Once you\u2019re in, look around to see if there\u2019s any kind of notification or other alert that indicates you\u2019re eligible to join the beta. If so, great! If not, you\u2019re either unlucky or you\u2019re on an ineligible carrier.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in, make sure you run a software update on your device to actually download and install the beta. Before you do so, however, make sure you\u2019ve backed up your device and saved anything critical that isn\u2019t already stored in the cloud somewhere. If you\u2019re lucky enough to make it into the beta, the usual warnings apply\u2014you\u2019ll be testing out prerelease software, which may or may not cause issues for your device at some point. That\u2019s the price you pay for early access to that which few others have. (Otherwise, you\u2019ll probably be waiting until December for the full release of One Ui 2.0 / Android 10.)\n\nTo leave the beta, just pull up the Settings portion of the Samsung Members app, under the triple-dot icon in the upper-right corner, and follow the easy-to-find option to deregister from the beta. If you do, your phone will reset\u2014removing all the data\u2014and you\u2019ll be able to restore from your most recent pre-beta backup, if applicable.\n\nNote that this update is being rolled out to different markets in staggered intervals, with the US, South Korea and Germany apparently first in line. If you can't see the option Down Under yet, keep checking back! With a little luck, the wait won't be much longer.", "description": "One of the bummers of buying a non-Pixel Android smartphone is that you are beholden to your manufacturer for Android updates.
