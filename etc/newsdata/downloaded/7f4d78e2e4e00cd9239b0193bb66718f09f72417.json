So you\u2019ve got to give it some extra love in that department.\n\nKeep an eye on your usage of extra harsh chemicals as the temperature drops. We recommend that you continue to use your exfoliating and anti-ageing heroes, but pay close attention as they might be aiding any unforeseen chapping if you\u2019re not balancing with extra moisture hits.\n\nEqually, don\u2019t use water that\u2019s too hot and steer clear of harsh soaps and astringent products as they\u2019ll also leave your skin starving. This advice should be applied to your skincare regime all year round but particularly when it\u2019s colder. We\u2019ve also left out silicones and drying alcohols to maximise the hydration benefits.\n\nThe basic rule of thumb for dry skin is to go heavy on the humectants (ingredients that reduce moisture loss) and soothing ingredients. Don\u2019t just panic buy thicker or richer creams to do the job as they will only give you short term results. You want to crack further than the crust to let your skin feast rather than just a quick snack.\n\nWith all this in mind, here are our favourite moisturisers for dry skin that deliver on long-term hydration.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

It is literally a first aid kit in a magical Korean founded tube.\n\nWe took this on a trip to Iceland (the country, not the supermarket) and can\u2019t tell you how much we relied on it. As an all over general moisturiser, a spot treatment or even for some lip service, we didn\u2019t leave our apartment without it. It\u2019s a real multi-tasker.\n\nThe formula contains an impressive range of ingredients from bifida ferment lysate \u2013 which protects against UV damage and helps with skin repair \u2013 and hyaluronic acid, with a hint of beetroot aiding whatever spot it hits. The thick gel feels comforting rather than cumbersome and a little goes a long way. This cream is at a moderate price point for the benefits it bestows.\n\nBuy now\n\nDear, Klairs rich moist soothing cream, 60ml: \u00a322.30, Beauty and Seoul\n\nAnother find from the K-Beauty aisle is this wonder from Klairs. Its super concentrated formula includes shea butter, hyaluronic acid and beta-glucan to support the skin\u2019s natural lipid barrier.\n\nThere\u2019s also a wonderfully cooling sensation and with gradual use this left our skin feeling calmer and more balanced overall. The ingredients here are non comedogenic so it\u2019s a great option for acne prone skin.\n\nThis is especially great when used as a mask, either night or day, as the yeast derived beta-glucan gives a significant shift in the look of redness or problematic points on the skin. The perfect antidote for all round care.\n\nBuy now\n\nDr. Hauschka rose day cream, 30ml: \u00a333.50, Naturismo\n\nWe love this iconic rose day cream from Dr. Hauschka\u2019s ever expanding line which focuses on healing and sustainability. The brand extracts over 1075 rose petals for every tube, giving mature and sensitive skin types a lift. Soothing redness and discomfort, this thick cream needs some working into the skin but the benefits are worth it.\n\nThe rose petal extract provides a barrier to lock in moisture preventing any further dryness. Extracts of marshmallow and St. John\u2019s wort sign off the process. Results are supple and calmed skin from this small but mighty product.\n\nBuy now\n\nCharlotte Tilbury magic night cream, 50ml: \u00a3100, Charlotte Tilbury\n\nThe world\u2019s most famous make-up artist\u2019s skincare arsenal is equally as impressive as her ever expanding and beauty line. This night cream is an absolute gem of a find for keeping you soft in your slumber.\n\nThe peach gel formula is deceivingly rich, enveloping the skin into a supreme moisture surge. As it\u2019s not a traditional cream per se, we found this particularly easy to apply for such a heavy duty product. No kneading necessary. It leaves the face extremely dewy, so give yourself a good 20 minutes or so to let it settle before nestling into bed.\n\nEnriched with olus and castor seed oils for extra nourishing properties, this is the perfect choice for the uber dry. Give it a whirl too if you\u2019re not a fan of thick creamy textures.\n\nBuy now\n\nPeter Thomas Roth potent-C moisturiser, 50ml: \u00a366, Revolve\n\nThis might seem like an odd choice for a feature focusing on dry skin but vitamin C is a year-round necessity. This powerhouse from Peter Thomas Roth contains an impressive blend of the stuff, which can sometimes be a tad unruly.\n\nLuckily, the brand is one step ahead with this lightweight but lavish addition to the line. The hat trick of vitamin C, vitamin E and ferulic is a heavy weight anti pollution warrior, which is certainly welcomed considering we\u2019ll be squinting in the snow trying to get from A to B. You know that face.\n\nSealing this in with a face oil will have you set for the day with its benefits of hydrolysed elastin, collagen and hyaluronic acid. Wonderfully effective for working on uneven skin texture while keeping dry skin at bay.\n\nBuy now\n\nTata Harper creme riche, 50ml: \u00a3170, Cult Beauty\n\nIn here we have 43 natural performing ingredients with 16 sources of hydration so we\u2019re off to a good start. One of our favourite skincare ingredients \u2013 hyaluronic acid \u2013 features for the most reliable moisture boost while essential fatty acids lock everything in beautifully.\n\nA small amount is all you need, warm this up in the palms of your hands to activate the sugars and watch the cream transform into a white velvety texture. There\u2019s also a selection of butters in here to really moisturise any flakiness on the surface of the skin. If you\u2019re a fan of particularly dewy skin, this is the one for you.\n\nBuy now\n\nMalin and Goetz advanced renewal cream, 50ml: \u00a386, Cult Beauty\n\nWhen we\u2019re not spritzing ourselves with Malin and Goetz dark rum, we\u2019re using this. Enriched with acmel\u200bla flower extract to help stimulate collagen production, there\u2019s also wallops of glycerin and and macadamia seed oil to seal the deal.\n\nThe fruit complex leaves skin feeling super soft and works particularly well on sensitive skin types thanks to a lack of fragrance and unnecessary extras. We also love that it sits well under SPF. It\u2019s a no nonsense, get the job done affair and sometimes that\u2019s all you need.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Inkey List hemp oil cream moisturiser, 30ml: \u00a37.99, Feel Unique\n\nThe team behind The Inkey List were feeling frustrated at all the silly jargon in the beauty world, so they came up with an affordable regime of products that are each led by a single ingredient. This hemp oil moisturiser adds something a little different to the mix.\n\nHemp oil is a blend of fatty acids which is great for calming irritated and lacklustre skin. Green tea extract aids in the defense department too.\n\nThe coconut oil is a potential comedogenic so beware if you\u2019re prone to breakouts. Other than that, we loved the lightweight texture and how it left the skin feeling cared for but not overwhelmed. For the price of a couple of coffees, we can\u2019t argue with that.\n\nBuy now\n\nPatchology\u200b Aquaflash daily gel moisturiser, 50ml\u200b: \u00a330, Patchology\n\nIf you want something to really quench your thirst but you don\u2019t want to rely on thicker creams, the masters of masking at Patchology have come up with this gel based formula. It\u2019s a concoction of hyaluronic acid, vitamin B and aloe which is pretty much like drinking a two litre bottle of water or indeed throwing it at your face.\n\nThe gel formula won\u2019t clog pores either so is particularly good if you\u2019re sceptical of adding extra moisture for fear of breakouts. Super refreshing and a pleasure to apply, this really feels like you\u2019re doing some good.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Moisturisers for dry skin\n\nDr. Jart\u2019s multi-tasking beauty gets the top spot for surviving even Scandi Septembers. Close second is Dear, Klairs thanks to a clever and delivering formula. The Inkey List has to get a shout out for price alone but also coming up with the goods.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
