With the goal of combining elements from lingerie, activewear, and swim attire, Lively has managed to create bras and bralettes with stylish details that don\u2019t skimp on functionality or comfort, no matter your cup size.\n\nRight now, you can snag one of Lively\u2019s best-selling pieces, The Deco Mesh Bralettee, exclusively from Nordstrom and Lively, including Harbor Green, Jet Black, and Shell Pink.\n\nMade with nylon and spandex, the bra is designed to become one of your go-to undergarments, whether you\u2019re throwing on a t-shirt or getting dressed up for a night on the town. It features a subtle geometric mesh design and a plunging neckline to seamlessly provide support even in lower-cut tops. A delicate piece of fabric connects the cups for an extra detail while clasps secure the bralette in the back.\n\nThanks to adjustable straps and removable pads, you can also customize the bralette to perfectly fit to your body. And unlike traditional bras, there aren\u2019t any restrictive wires, just a wide elastic band to provide comfort and support. Sizes range from extra-small to large, corresponding with bra measurements 30A to 38D.\n\nWhile there aren\u2019t any reviews for the exact bralette in its new limited-edition colors on Nordstrom just yet, Lively shoppers aren\u2019t shy about singing their praises for the brand\u2019s comfortable undergarments. \u201cI don\u2019t even take this bra off as soon as I get home. I wear it EVERY DAY,\u201d one reviewer wrote about The Stripe Mesh Bralette, a style similar to The Deco Mesh Bralettee.\n\nThe comfy bra is available for $35 with free shipping from Nordstrom right now, but you\u2019ll have to act fast to secure the item in your favorite color and size. There\u2019s no telling how long this bralette will stay in stock.\n\nCourtesy More\n\nShop now: $35; nordstrom.com", "description": "The Geo Mesh Bralette from Lively is now available in new limited-edition colors exclusively on Nordstrom.
