Flush with cash, the campaign is planning to announce a state director and additional ground staff there in the coming weeks, a campaign official tells TIME. Internal campaign data has convinced Trump\u2019s political advisors they can energize a slice of the state\u2019s Hispanic voters to vote for Trump in 2020 by emphasizing Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, border security and his trade confrontation with China. According to U.S. Census data, 49.1 percent of New Mexico\u2019s residents identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino.\n\nThe move is part of a series of bets Trump is making to win states that went for Clinton in 2016. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior White House advisor Jared Kushner says that voter data has convinced the reelection effort to fund robust field operations in a much larger number of states than in 2016. \u201cI can see us very aggressively playing in 18 swing states,\u201d Jared Kushner tells TIME, adding that in his view, the 2016 Trump campaign \u201cseriously played\u201d in about 11 swing states\u2026\n\nTo do it, the Trump campaign is targeting states that have high rates of support for Trump among Republicans. The bet is that they can ramp up turnout and swamp the votes in traditional Democratic strongholds. That strategy hinges on developing accurate data to find would-be Trump voters and using the months-long head start over a still-unknown Democratic opponent to build a ground operation that ensures those voters are registered and get to the polls. It also plays to Trump\u2019s strength for whipping up controversies that energize his supporters.", "description": "", "authors": ["Time.Com"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
