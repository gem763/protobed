It formed quietly in March but will begin running its first TV and digital ads Thursday night \u2014 part of $10 million in issue advertising planned for 2019, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe nonprofit will operate as an affiliate of House Majority PAC, Democrats\u2019 flagship super PAC focused on House races. But unlike the super PAC, it will not have to disclose its donors and some details about its spending.\n\nThe new group is charged with amplifying a House Democratic agenda, which has run into a Republican-controlled Senate and media coverage of other issues. House Majority Forward plans to raise $20 million this year, according to documents filed with state regulators in North Carolina, pouring half of that into advertising.\n\nThe inaugural ad , backed by a six-figure buy on national cable and online, features a woman pummeling a punching bag in a darkened gym, while a narrator ticks through bills to lower drug prices, expand gun control, give some undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship and curtail secret money in politics \u2014 which largely flows through 501(c)(4) nonprofits similar to House Majority Forward.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

American Action Network, the GOP nonprofit linked with Congressional Leadership Fund, the party\u2019s House super PAC, spent tens of millions of dollars promoting Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and pass a new tax law in 2017 and 2018. AAN raised $51.8 million from July 2017 through June 2018 and spent $50.9 million, according to the GOP nonprofit\u2019s latest tax return.\n\nHouse Majority PAC didn\u2019t have a similar affiliate before the 2016 election, though other liberal groups stepped in to savage Republican incumbents with early ads about health care and taxes.\n\nGoing forward, House Majority PAC will share personnel with House Majority Forward, including executive director Abby Curran Horrell and president Robby Mook. The new nonprofit\u2019s directors include Mook; Ali Lapp, who founded House Majority PAC in 2011; Jesse Ferguson, who ran the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s independent expenditure arm in 2014 and later served on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign under Mook; Phil Schiliro, a top aide in the Obama White House; Heather Stone, Mook\u2019s chief of staff on the Clinton campaign; and Brian Wolff, a longtime ally and former aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi who is now the executive vice president of the Edison Electric Institute, where he has been a lobbyist for much of the last decade. He is not currently a registered lobbyist.\n\n\u201cHouse Majority Forward is committed to educating the American people about significant progressive legislative accomplishments \u2014 and what\u2019s holding them up,\u201d Mook said in a statement.\n\nOne of the early bills House Democrats passed this year was a sweeping government reform measure that targeted, among other things, \u201cdark money\u201d in politics. But Democrats involved in the planning for House Majority Forward said they weren\u2019t concerned about using a secret-money group to back lawmakers who ran on getting secret money out of politics in the 2018 midterm election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse to tie an arm behind your back in the fight\u201d by forswearing nonprofit groups, said one Democratic strategist who was involved in early discussions about House Majority Forward. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of silly that Democrats didn\u2019t have this weapon already.\u201d", "description": "A new nonprofit group, House Majority Forward, is running its first TV and digital ads Thursday night.", "authors": ["Scott Bland"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8a/2a/e9180b714c8a9d68bb11c46b3030/190226-mook-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-25"}
