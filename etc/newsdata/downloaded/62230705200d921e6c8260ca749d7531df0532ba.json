(Image: NBC)\n\nAnd the story of some wild auditions.\n\nWe\u2019re all a little weepy nowadays with The Good Place getting ready to start its final season, which may be definitive proof that we are not in the Good Place. And this new video posted by NBC \u2014 a behind-the-scenes featurette with interviews from Mike Schur and the cast spliced with footage from the show\u2019s now-legendary audition process.\n\nIt\u2019s those auditions that make this video in particular worth watching. When The Good Place was cast, as those involved have explained many times, the premise of the show was so secret that the auditions were done with fake scripts meant to evoke the vibe of the character they were looking for.\n\nJanet, for instance, was cast with a reading for a character who worked on some sort of hotline for broken dolls. Here, we get to see a bit of that bizarre audition, which D\u2019Arcy Carden, by the way, absolutely nails.\n\nAnd this video really highlights how daringly strange the premise of this show is, and the potential it had to be either treacly or absolutely boring. We\u2019re extremely grateful it managed to dodge both bullets while constantly, tenaciously reinventing itself.\n\nThe Good Place premieres for its final season September 27 in the U.S., and I\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying. The season will likely appear on Netflix in Australia, although a release date hasn't yet been set.", "description": "And the story of some wild auditions.", "authors": ["David Nield", "James Whitbrook"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/o4as2ubbdfwtj1jrwrzd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
