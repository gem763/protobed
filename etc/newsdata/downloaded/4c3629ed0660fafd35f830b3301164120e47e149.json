Fifty-four per cent of this group want him to stay in post, while 34 per cent think he should quit.\n\nMr Corbyn is facing fresh anger over his latest Brexit position after the Labour leadership proposed that the party should not decide what position it would take in a future Brexit referendum until after the next general election.\n\nThat drew fire from MPs, including senior shadow cabinet ministers, and is the subject of a wrecking plan by grassroots activists, who want the party to adopt a firmly pro-Remain stance.\n\nAmid warnings from senior Labour figures about a further \u201cfudge\u201d, the YouGov poll found that voters are confused about the party\u2019s current Brexit policy. Sixty-nine per cent said it was either \u201ccompletely unclear\u201d or \u201cfairly unclear\u201d, while just 15 per cent thought it was clear.\n\nIn a sign that 2017 Labour voters risk abandoning the party over Brexit, 58 per cent of this group said the party\u2019s policy was not clear, compared to 30 per cent who thought it was.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It found that only 27 per cent of Remain backers support the position he has taken, while 46 per cent say they disagree with it.\n\nThe figures among all voters are even worse for the Labour leader, with 55 per cent saying they disagreed with his position compared to just 16 per cent who support it.\n\nPeople who voted Labour in 2017 are also more likely to be unhappy with Mr Corbyn\u2019s strategy, with 39 per cent against and 32 per cent in favour.\n\nHowever, Mr Corbyn is likely to be buoyed by support from people who say they plan to vote Labour at the next election. Six out of every 10 current Labour supporters back his position, while only 18 per cent disagree.\n\nChris Curtis, YouGov\u2019s political research manager, said: \u201cNew YouGov polling demonstrates how Corbyn has fallen out of favour with not just the wider public at large but his own voters too, as a majority of 2017 Labour backers now think it\u2019s time for him to stand down.\n\n\u201cThe task now for the Labour leader, with an election seemingly imminent, is to win back these voters if he is to stand any chance of emulating his 2017 success.\u201d", "description": "A majority of people who voted\u00a0Labour\u00a0at the last general election want Jeremy Corbyn to stand down as party leader, a new poll has found.
