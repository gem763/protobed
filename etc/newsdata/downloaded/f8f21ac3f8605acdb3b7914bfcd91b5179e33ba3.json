Then I Found These All-Season, Tailored House Shorts.", "url": "https://nymag.com/strategist/article/nice-laundry-lounge-short-review.html", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-30", "downloaded_at": "2019-09-02 07:25:59.640292+00:00", "text": "7 items in this article Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nI\u2019m about to say something fairly controversial: I\u2019m that guy who really doesn\u2019t like sweatpants \u2014 or most types of loungewear, for that matter. I do own loungewear; I just don\u2019t care for how most of it fits or looks. Generally, I find it too slouchy and unkempt (yes, I know that\u2019s part of the appeal) to wear anytime other than right before bed. Very, very rarely will I wear loungewear outside the house. This aversion has made me and my boyfriend an odd couple of sorts, because his first move after a long day is to change out of his work clothes, while I choose to stay buttoned up in my button-down (it should come as no surprise that I\u2019m also a fan of dressing for dinner).\n\nBut to my surprise, I recently stumbled upon a pair of mesh shorts that converted me to the church of comfy casual. I first discovered the shorts, by by Nice Laundry, via a friend\u2019s tweet, which touted them as more stylish loungewear with a tailored fit \u2014 basically something you wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed to be seen in if a neighbor caught you on an early-morning milk run at the bodega. That promise lured me in enough to look them up, and when I saw they start at an affordable $28 \u2014 and can be embroidered with your initials or little decals like a money bag or American flag for not much more \u2014 I figured that giving them a try came with little to lose (aside from a few shreds of dignity if they wound up looking slovenly).\n\nI\u2019ll admit I was a little worried about their mesh fabric. Would they look too much like workout shorts? The last thing I wanted \u2014 aside from another garment I would wear only under my comforter \u2014 was something that guilted me for not going to the gym. The moment I put the shorts on, though, I realized my fabric fears were unfounded. The material is very soft, almost like a combination of jersey and mesh. And the shorts are made with a double layer of mesh, so the fine holes in the fabric are really imperceptible. Even with the two layers, they\u2019re super-light \u2014 perfect for warm weather, but seemingly equally ideal in cooler months for movie nights on the couch beneath a cozy blanket (which can sometimes get too toasty in full sweats). The best part? They fit beautifully. Neither slouchy nor unkempt, my pair has a four-inch inseam and is a size small (I\u2019m about five-foot-seven), and they hit well above the knee at a part of my thigh that makes me look like I did #legday a few more times than in reality.\n\nNice Laundry Customized Lounge Short I only have the one pair, which are navy and customized with a skull-and-crossbones patch (one of many patch styles the brand offers), but I wear it all the time \u2014 at least four times a week, and definitely on every weekend day. (I\u2019ve washed them once a week since I bought them a few months ago, and, so far, the color, fit, and elastic waist have really held up.) That said, I\u2019m already eyeing a second pair \u2014 mine don\u2019t have pockets, but Nice Laundry sells a six-inch version of the shorts with pockets and a drawstring waist that are calling me. The shorts are stylish enough to wear with a tee and a pair of loafers while picking up coffee and bagels in the morning, and even though I didn\u2019t want them to look like workout shorts, there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t wear them to work out in a pinch. And if you\u2019re wondering, yes, they\u2019re even nice-looking enough to wear to dinner \u2014 as long as it\u2019s served at home. $34 at Nice Laundry Buy\n\nNice Laundry Lounge Short Here\u2019s the standard version of my navy shorts with a four-inch inseam. For the same price as my pair with the patch, you can get them monogrammed with your initials. $28 at Nice Laundry Buy\n\nNice Laundry Lounge Short Here they are in black \u2026 $28 at Nice Laundry Buy\n\nNice Laundry Lounge Short \u2026 And in olive green. $28 at Nice Laundry Buy\n\nNice Laundry Lounge Short For the bold, the brand sells them in this color it calls \u201ccream,\u201d which looks more like a crisp white. $28 at Nice Laundry Buy\n\nNice Laundry Lounge Shorts, Variety 3-Pack What I should have probably done is buy this 3-pack, which includes the navy, black, and olive-green lounge shorts and breaks down to a slightly cheaper $25 per pair. $75 at Nice Laundry Buy\n\nNice Laundry Pocket Lounge Short The shorts with pockets and a six-inch inseam also come in navy and burgundy, in styles you can customize with a patch or a monogram (for $39 each), and in a 3-pack (for $89). $33 at Nice Laundry Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
