So why are bond yields rising?\n\nThe rose from a recent low of 1.47% on 9/4 to 1.72% on Tuesday. The record low was 1.37%, hit on 7/8/16 just after the Brits voted to leave the European Union (EU). The risks of a no-deal Brexit have eased in recent days, though it still could happen next month. A hard Brexit could cause the bond yield to retest its recent low.\n\nGlobal Bond Yields\n\nIn any event, the main reason that the US bond yield has moved higher in recent days has more to do with Germany than the UK. The has risen from a recent record low of -0.71% on 8/30 to -0.54% Tuesday. Reuter\u2019s reported: \u201cGermany\u2019s briefly rose into positive territory on Tuesday for the first time in over a month, lifted by expectations for fiscal stimulus and caution over the scale of stimulus the European Central Bank might deliver this week.\u201d\n\nDuring a parliamentary budget debate on Tuesday, Germany\u2019s Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said that Germany can counter a possible recession with a big stimulus package. On Monday, Reuters reported that Germany was considering creating a \u201cshadow budget\u201d to boost public investment above and beyond limits set by its national debt rules, sparking a bond sell-off.\n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi has been lobbying for fiscal policy to turn more stimulative to support the ECB\u2019s ultra-easy monetary policies. Germany has resisted doing so and even questioned whether the ECB\u2019s asset purchase program could legally buy sovereign bonds. Germany\u2019s fiscal and monetary conservatives might be starting to waver as a result of Germany\u2019s intensifying manufacturing recession, with factory orders and production down 5.6% and 4.8% y/y through July.\n\nGerman Manufacturing And Production\n\nLast year, when there was widespread bearishness in the bond market, with some predicting that the US yield would rise from 3% to 4%-5%, I observed that the US bond yield might be \u201ctethered\u201d to the comparable German and Japanese yields, which were barely above zero. This year, both have dropped solidly below zero.\n\nDuring the Q&A portion of his 7/25 press conference, Draghi pleaded for more fiscal stimulus, especially from Germany:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s hitting the manufacturing sector in Germany and [elsewhere in Europe is] an idiosyncratic shock. Here what becomes really very important is fiscal policy. [T]he mildly expansionary fiscal policy is supporting activity in the euro area. But if there were to be a significant worsening in the Eurozone economy, it\u2019s unquestionable that fiscal policy \u2026 becomes of the essence. \u2026 I started making this point way back in 2014 in a Jackson Hole speech: monetary policy has done a lot to support the euro area \u2026 but if we continue with this deteriorating outlook, fiscal policy will become of the essence.\u201d", "description": "Bonds Analysis by Ed Yardeni covering: Germany 30-Year, United States 10-Year, US 10 Year vs Germany 10 Year Spread.
