For instance, when JPMorgan Chase released its JPM Coin, it presented it as a \u201cdigital coin,\u201d while Facebook\u2019s Libra was introduced as a solid \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d \u2014 and, ironically, that could be part of the reason why regulators around the world got so worked up about the latter.\n\nNevertheless, while JPM Coin and Libra are different by design, in both cases, decentralization pundits were quick to discard them as not \u201ccryptocurrencies,\u201d but \u201cvirtual money\u201d or \u201cdigital currencies\u201d \u2014 basically because they are run by corporations and hence are centralized. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not quite as simple: While decentralization is a core ideology behind cryptocurrencies, some of them can be centralized, at least to a certain degree.\n\nThus, a cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency (the subtleties between these will be discussed later in the article) that is built with strong cryptography, which makes it highly secure and immutable. Most cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a decentralized network of computers. However, blockchain-free cryptocurrencies are technically possible, too \u2014 in fact, Digicash, one of the earliest forms of cryptographic electronic payments that was released in the early 1990s, did not have a blockchain.\n\nTo make things even more complicated, there are subcategories within conventional, modern (blockchain-based) cryptocurrencies, as well \u2014 i.e., NEO is a coin, while Binance Coin (BNB) is actually a token. As you can now see, there is a lot of confusion in the crypto space surrounding these terms, and this article will attempt to get things straight.", "description": "Are crypto tokens different than coins?
