The alcoholic seltzer has a low calorie count, LaCroix-adjacent flavor and a meme-ability that millennials love \u2014 so much so that stores nationwide are running out, and last week, the company instituted panic-inducing rationing. But while the fizzy drink is getting a generation buzzed, it\u2019s also not-so-quietly busting a glass ceiling. Unlike so many of its boozy predecessors, the Claw is equally beloved by men and women.\n\nFor decades, our televisions told us that men drank beer, women drank wine, and that\u2019s just the way the world was. Beer commercials, even when they\u2019re not overtly objectifying women, often still truck in mundane male fantasy: dudes sharing brews with their bros on game day, hanging out over the grill or golfing.\n\n[We did it, America. We ate Popeyes out of chicken sandwiches.]\n\nWine, meanwhile, is often sold as Mommy Juice to stressed-out ladies who escape the suburban carpool grind with slugs from labels such as Little Black Dress and Skinnygirl.\n\nSometimes, after years of such gendered marketing, a company will realize that it has ignored or alienated half of its potential customer base, and then overcorrect, occasionally to awkward effect. In a new Coors Light commercial, a woman is shown performing post-workday rituals that include grabbing a beer from the fridge and whipping off her bra through her sleeve. The ad dubbed Coors \u201cThe Official Beer of Being Done Wearing a Bra\u201d \u2014 and immediately touched off a debate: Was it sexist? Relatable?\n\n\u201cThe alcohol industry keeps shooting itself in the foot,\u201d says Susan Dobscha, a professor of marketing at Bentley University. \u201cIt\u2019s shortsighted to genderize an entire product category.\u201d\n\nWhite Claw, meanwhile, has sidestepped all that whiplash.\n\nIt\u2019s huge among men and women in equal measures. There\u2019s a clean 50-50 split in younger consumers of hard seltzer, according to a study last month by Bank of America Merrill Lynch that analyzed the drinking preferences of millennials. And according to Nielsen data, White Claw accounts for more than half of seltzer sales. Women love it. Even frat boys and the bro-iest of men love it. Comedian Trevor Wallace\u2019s YouTube testosterone-steeped ode to White Claw (\u201cit\u2019s like Perrier that does squats\u201d) has been viewed millions of times \u2014 and spawned the oft-echoed catchphrase \u201cain\u2019t no laws when you\u2019re drinking Claws!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could see White Claw as the dawning of this post-gender world where millennials and Gen Z are comfortable with the idea of gender fluidity,\u201d Dobscha says.\n\nWhite Claw\u2019s ads and social media posts feature the canned product \u2014 slimmer and taller than a traditional beer can \u2014 front and center, with men and women firmly in the backdrop. And when they do appear, they\u2019re on equal footing.\n\nThere\u2019s football \u2014 not on a bar TV but rather a co-ed game being played outdoors. Women might be shown in tightfitting clothes, but it\u2019s athletic gear or just regular beachwear, and the models look strong and fit instead of seductive.\n\n[The summer of hard seltzer is coming. Here\u2019s how 4 of the top brands stack up.]\n\nThat\u2019s entirely intentional, says Sanjiv Gajiwala, vice president of marketing for White Claw. When the brand launched in 2016, the idea behind it was that the traditional worlds depicted in beverage marketing had pretty much gone extinct. White Claw would be the drink of the new gender norms, of the kinds of \u201cgroup hangs\u201d that define young people\u2019s social lives. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a world where guys got together in a basement and drank beer and women were off doing something else, drinking with their girlfriends,\u201d Gajiwala said. \u201cWhatever we put out creatively and how we positioned the brand really reflects that everyone hangs out together all the time.\u201d\n\nHard seltzer is an entire category born catering to the millennial sensibility.\n\n\u201cBeer marketers have been trying to crack the code of being gender-neutral after years of ignoring half the population,\u201d says Harry Schuhmacher, editor and publisher of Beer Business Daily. \u201cBig brewers haven\u2019t really been able to do it, but then White Claw came in, and it\u2019s always been a gender-neutral thing.\u201d\n\nDanelle Kosmal, vice president of Nielsen\u2019s beverage alcohol practice, sees hard seltzer as one of the few beverages that\u2019s managed to pull off this feat. \u201cHard seltzer is one of the most gender-neutral products we have seen across the alcohol industry,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIn comparison, traditional beer drinkers are two times more likely to be men than women.\u201d And the relatively new drink is gaining on beer: A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch study found that it accounts for 5 percent of the beer market.\n\n\n\nWhite Claw isn\u2019t the only hard seltzer brand to capitalize on consumers\u2019 desire for a low-calorie alcoholic beverage. (Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Amanda Soto/The Washington Post)\n\nOver the summer, it seemed that White Claw morphed from a mere drink into a full-on lifestyle. What started out as \u201cHot Girl Summer\u201d was re-dubbed \u201cWhite Claw Summer,\u201d a selfies-by-the-pool, hashtagged shorthand for good times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s aspirational,\u201d says Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Bryan Spillane, of hard seltzers\u2019 low-sugar, low-calorie appeal to younger drinkers \u2014 men and women \u2014 who want to party beachside and care how they look doing it. It\u2019s also gluten-free. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole low-carb, keto-friendly, CrossFit life.\u201d And even drinkers who aren\u2019t hardcore health nuts buy in. \u201cThey might be keto in their minds,\u201d Spillane says. \u201cIt\u2019s aspirational, in ways that have nothing to do with gender.\u201d\n\nAll kinds of communities have sprung up around White Claw. Ashley Schmillen is a member of the Facebook group Phish Fans Who Love White Claw, a page started by a friend of hers this summer as a joke that\u2019s now up to more than 4,500 members. The group posts lyrics from the jam band \u2014 altered, of course, with references to their favorite drink. They mark one another\u2019s birthdays by posting videos of themselves shotguning Claws.\n\n[Add wine water to the list of options for the sober-curious and LaCroix-fatigued]\n\nMembers of the group are genuinely passionate about the drink \u2014 but Schmillen, a 34-year-old stay-home-mom from Minneapolis, says they\u2019re just as into the shared humor of it all. \u201cThey\u2019re there for the jokes,\u201d says Schmillen, who has an Etsy shop where she sells stickers and tank tops bearing the group\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this balancing act between it being a meme and it being a real thing,\u201d says Don Carter, an engineer in Los Angeles. Although he approaches the drink with a bit of irony, he appreciates its convenience. As an exclusive vodka-and-soda drinker, he says, he has welcomed finding cans of White Claw at parties. \u201cUsually you\u2019d go to a barbecue and there\u2019s just beer \u2014 so it fits the bill there.\u201d\n\nSchuhmacher says the beer industry in particular has been slower to adapt because the biggest companies have historically been family-owned. \u201cHabits and mores change more slowly than when you have a publicly traded company with shareholders,\u201d he said.\n\nHard seltzer even has appeal among drinkers who would ordinarily consider themselves too sophisticated to swill a canned malted liquor. Brad Glynn, the co-founder and vice president of marketing of Minnesota craft brewery Lift Bridge, said his company decided to develop its own line of hard seltzers after seeing the success of the national brands \u2014 even with beer connoisseurs. All it took was overcoming a little beer snobbery. \u201cWe looked around and saw that all of our friends are drinking it \u2014 we\u2019re drinking it \u2014 so why are we scared of that?\u201d he said. Their strategy? \u201cLet\u2019s do it and let\u2019s do it better.\u201d\n\nThe entry of craft brewers into the category suggests that the hard seltzer phenomenon is more than a blip, unlike its spiritual predecessor, the 1990s one-hit wonder that was Zima, Coors\u2019 lemon-lime malt drink. Zima, which become a synonym for \u201ceffete\u201d in David Letterman\u2019s late-night jokes, never could shake its \u201cgirly-man\u201d association.\n\nThe industry is taking notice: Natural Light just launched a new seltzer line (and hired Wallace for a marketing stunt that involved the comedian famous for his love of Claw to land a Natty-Light-branded helicopter on a yacht off Catalina Island). A higher-alcohol (and probably higher-testosterone) entry is expected soon from Four Loko, the company best known for a mid-2000s caffeinated malt liquor that was ultimately banned by the Food and Drug Administration. They\u2019ll join other White Claw competitors, including Boston Beer\u2019s Truly and Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s Bon & Viv.\n\nSome forecasters suspect that overall, hard seltzer sales might fall off a bit in cooler weather. But there\u2019s no indication that the fizzy party is close to being over. According to data from Nielsen, sales are projected to top the $1 billion mark by the end of 2019. And the Bank of America Merrill Lynch study finds that there is \u201ca big untapped market potential\u201d for the category.\n\nThe end of summer brings tailgates, Halloween parties and holiday revelry \u2014 or in the language of White Claw\u2019s marketing department, plenty more chances for a co-ed group hang.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nPeaches, raspberries and wine: This white sangria is bright and refreshing\n\nIs Pepsi\u2019s Bubly the new LaCroix, or just another cute can?\n\nGet Voraciously\u2019s Plant Powered newsletter and start cooking the way you want to", "description": "Unlike beer or wine, hard seltzer is an entire category born catering to millennials.", "authors": ["Emily Heil", "Co-Author Of The Reliable Source", "September At Pm", "Emily Heil Is The Co-Author Of The Reliable Source", "Previously Helped Pen The In The Loop Column With Al Kamen."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FqpppQ0IsmR51Mbv17VHWxXvYLM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3PRI5ZW3FIZI5J33KQ7NERFKA4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
