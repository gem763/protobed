Email webnews@mirror.co.uk\n\n(Image: Epic Games)\n\nHas Fortnite been deleted entirely?\n\nFortnite went down just as the Season X event was scheduled to begin at 19:00 BST (14:00 EST).\n\nSince then, the game has been unaccessible online, with players being met by a strange black hole when trying to play.\n\nStrangely, Epic Games, the developer behind Fortnite, has also deleted all tweets from the Fortnite Twitter page, leaving only the live stream.\n\nThis has led many baffled players to believe that Fortnite has been deleted entirely.\n\nOne user tweeted: \u201cYo I think Fortnite is actually gone. Like they deleted the game,\u201d while another added: \u201cThey actually deleted Fortnite #RIPFortnite.\u201d\n\nThankfully, this is very unlikely to be the case, and instead, we predict that the outage is in preparation for Fortnite Chapter 2.\n\nHas Elon Musk deleted Fortnite?\n\nElon Musk appears to have hinted he could be responsible for the Fortnite blackout with a cryptic tweet.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO has retweeted a fake news article from 2018, which claims Musk bought and deleted Fortnite \u2018to save these kids from eternal virginity.\u2019\n\nAt the time, Musk tweeted the story with the caption \u2018Had to be done ur welcome.\u2019 He has now retweeted it, simply writing \u2018Haha.\u2019\n\nThankfully his tweet is clearly made in jest, and has had some hilarious replies.\n\nThe Fortnite News account replied: \u201cGod damn it, Elon,\u201d while professional Fortnite player Hogman added: \u201cAlright fine you win this time, but you have to hire all of the pro players that are now jobless.\u201d\n\nWhy has Fortnite crashed?\n\nThe outage is likely simply hype for the release of the 11th season of Fortnite, widely referred to as Fortnite Chapter 2.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Epic Games has pulled such a stunt.\n\n(Image: Epic Games)\n\nAt the end of season seven, players noticed large cracks forming in the ground of the island, and eventually this formed a big volcano - marking the start of season eight.\n\nMirror Online has contacted Epic Games for comment.\n\nWhen will Fortnite be back online?\n\nWhile Epic Games has remained tight-lipped about when the game will be back online, rumours suggest that there are still few days to wait.\n\nDataminer, Lucas7yoshi, has delved into code of the game, and discovered an end time for the outage.\n\nHis findings suggest that Fortnite will be back online at 09:00 BST (04:00 EST).\n\nHowever, he tweeted: \u201cI really doubt they really going to make people not play for 4 days or whatever straight but it\u2019s Epic lmao. Take it as you will.\u201d\n\nAre Fortnite skins safe during the outage?\n\nMany fans are panicking that their precious skins may have been lost in the process.\n\nSkins are graphics which can be used to change the appearance of a character in the game, and typically cost between \u00a36 and \u00a320.\n\nSpeaking to Mirror Online, concerned mother Kayla Williams said: \u201cMy son is heartbroken, he\u2019s spent a massive \u00a33,000 on this game since he started playing in season2.\n\n\u201cWhat are Epic going to do? People saying the game has ended for good so do we get full refunds on the money we spent because no game means no nothing so we lose out!\u201d\n\nThankfully, PlayStation has confirmed that any items bought in the game are secure during the outage.\n\nThe Ask PlayStation Twitter account explained: \u201cPlease be assured that your inventory items and V-Bucks are secure during the Fortnite Blackout.", "description": "The reason for the Fortnite crash remains unclear, but several theories are circulating online about the outage", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Epic Games"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575797.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Fortnite-black-hole-Mums-say-kids-are-heartbroken-and-feel-world-has-ended.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
