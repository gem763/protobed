That and she\u2019s hardly the first celebrity to have different living arrangements with their partner.\n\nAnd it\u2019s way more exciting making your \u2018dream house\u2019 the first place you live in together.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about Kaley, though, who has said she doesn\u2019t mind living separately for the time being, because she knows it won\u2019t be forever.\n\nShe\u2019s building her dream home with her hubby (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nShe recently told Extra: \u2018Life is about balance. It\u2019s great \u2013 we are building our dream house, so we\u2019re gonna be in our home together very soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But as of now, it\u2019s worked out fine for us. I have no problem with it.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s discussed her separate living arrangements with Karl, with the 33-year-old opening up on her self-described unconventional living arrangements earlier this year, when she said she does plan on moving in with Karl \u2018eventually\u2019.\n\nThey married last year (Picture: AFP)\n\nShe said in August to E! News: \u2018We\u2019re eventually going to be under the same roof forever. We have a very unconventional marriage, you know. We have different locations that we\u2019re at a lot.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not together every single day.\u2019\n\nAlthough they don\u2019t live together, the actress knows Karl \u2013 whom she met at a horse show in 2016 \u2013 is the right man for her, because they both share a love for all animals, especially horses.\n\nRecalling the first time they met, she said: \u2018I was already involved with horses, then we happened to meet at a horse show. It was totally meant to be. We were pretty much a good match from the beginning.\u2019\n\nThe couple bonded over their shared \u2018love for animals\u2019 (seriously, who doesn\u2019t love animals), and Kaley said she was attracted to Karl because his career working with horses meant he had a \u2018kind soul\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018We share so much love for animals \u2013 we love horses and we love the sport. I think anyone who works with animals has to have a kind soul. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s the horse whisperer.\n\n\u2018He is just wonderful with them. It\u2019s really beautiful to see that patience he has with them \u2026 he\u2019s so gentle.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
