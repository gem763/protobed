The pair then took it back to shore, where they released the animal into the wild.\n\nIn the footage Brett can be heard saying: 'Good afternoon, what do we got in the basket, we got us a little bobcat.\n\n'He's not happy, here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. I think he wants in the boat but we're not gonna let him.' The footage shows the bobcat staring and growling menacingly as the anglers are heard discussing what action to take next.\n\nBob wrote that the bobcat was carried back to dry land and safely released once on shore.\n\nThe fishermen were not sure how the bobcat got so far away from land, although the species - the most common wildcat found in North America - is known to swim.\n\nCindy Benson, a local woman who spoke to Bob and his son about the animal, said the pair wanted to ensure that the bobcat was returned to its natural habitat.\n\nBob Hereford, (pictured), said his son Brett caught the bobcat 'very carefully' in a bid to save it from drowning\n\nThe fishermen were not sure how the bobcat got so far away from land, although the species - the most common wildcat found in North America - is known to swim\n\nShe told the Missoulian: 'It was quite the experience for those guys. They were just anglers that were fishing for Mack Days during the event.\n\n'(The bobcat) was quite a ways out (from shore) and they went over and looked at it. They believed that if they didn't net it, it was going to drown. It looked really tired.'\n\nBenson said Hereford told her the bobcat was shivering for quite a while and they were worried about it.\n\n'It was acting like it wanted loose, so they did take it in to shore and turned it loose. Other anglers went over and watched the whole process. They saw it a while later on the other side of Finley Point walking along the shore.'\n\nBenson said some people speculated the bobcat was trying to get to an island or perhaps had been dropped in the water by a predatory eagle.\n\n'That does happen. You just don't know. 'He's [Bob] been around wild animals being in the woods all his life, so he wouldn't have done this if he thought the bobcat didn't need help,' she added.", "description": "Two fisherman got quite a surprise when they spotted a bobcat thrashing around in water on a lake in Montana and decided to rescue him.
