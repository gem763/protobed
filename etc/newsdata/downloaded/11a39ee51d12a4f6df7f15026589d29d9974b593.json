The company announced the 65W SuperVOOC Fast Charge 2.0 at an event dedicated to charging technologies in Shenzhen yesterday.\n\nAfter a lot of anticipation about 65W SuperVOOC, let me show you how fast it really is! \ud83d\ude0e pic.twitter.com/p1UHi18v6Q \u2014 Brian Shen (@BrianShenYiRen) September 17, 2019\n\nZDNet's review of the Oppo RX17 Pro found that Oppo's 50W SuperVOOC charging tech could fully charge the device within 35 minutes and delivered a 73% charge in 20 minutes. The phone featured dual 1,850mAh batteries, creating a total of 3,700mAh. However, fast charging requires the SuperVOOC charging brick and cable.\n\nXiaomi has also been showing off its Super Charge Turbo on social media, claiming it can charge a 4,000mAh batter in just 17 minutes using its 100W technology. That technology will reportedly come to its RedMi phones first.\n\nAnd Xiaomi last month unveiled the Mi Charge Turbo, a 30W wireless charging system that can charge a 4,000mAh battery to 50% in 25 minutes and 100% in 70 minutes, XDA-Developers reported earlier this month. It will debut in the Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro 5G which could be released later this month.\n\nNot to be left behind, Oppo yesterday unveiled its 30W wireless VOOC charging system, claiming a phone with a 4,000mAh battery can reach a full charge within 80 minutes. It's also compatible with the Qi standard and charging power of 5W or 10W.\n\nFinally, Oppo upgrade VOOC Flash Charge to Version 4.0, dubbing it \"the next generation Flash Charge solution for all\". It will allow a 4,000mAh battery to be charged to 67% in 30 minutes and full in 73 minutes.", "description": "Oppo also unveils a 30W wireless charging system that can fully charge a 4,000mAh battery in 80 minutes.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/19/48a7ce71-db59-4dec-9539-507a580abc75/thumbnail/770x578/c6cf6d102050ba79d102531a33e44b8e/65w-supervooc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
