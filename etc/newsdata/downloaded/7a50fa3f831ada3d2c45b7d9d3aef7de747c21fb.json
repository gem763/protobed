If the robots are hiding from the people compiling the productivity data at BLS, they are also managing to hide from the statistical agencies in other countries.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that jobs are disappearing is directly contradicted by the fact that we have the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. The recovery that began in June 2009 is the longest on record. To be clear, many of those jobs are of poor quality, and there are people and places that have been left behind, often where factories have closed. But this, as Warren correctly claimed, was more about trade than technology.\n\nNo technology shock\n\nConsider, for example, the \"China shock\" of the 2000s, when sharply rising imports from countries with much lower-paid labour than ours drove up the US trade deficit by 2.4 percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP) (almost $US520 billion ($759 billion) in today's economy). From 2000 to 2007 (before the Great Recession), the country lost 3.4 million manufacturing jobs, or 20 per cent of the total.\n\nAddressing that loss, Susan Houseman, an economist who has done exhaustive, evidence-based analysis debunking the automation explanation, argues that \"intuitively and quite simply, there doesn't seem to have been a technology shock that could have caused a 20 per cent to 30 per cent decline in manufacturing employment in the space of a decade.\" What really happened in those years was that policymakers sat by while millions of US factory workers and their communities were exposed to global competition with no plan for transition or adjustment to the shock, decimating parts of Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. That was the fault of the policymakers, not the robots.\n\nBefore the China shock, from 1970 to 2000, the number (not the share) of manufacturing jobs held remarkably steady at around 17 million. Conversely, since 2010 and post-China shock, the trade deficit has stabilised and manufacturing has been adding jobs at a modest pace. (Most recently, the trade war has significantly dented the sector and worsened the trade deficit.) Over these periods, productivity, automation and robotics all grew apace.\n\nIn other words, automation isn't the problem. We need to look elsewhere to craft a progressive jobs agenda that focuses on the real needs of working people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst and foremost, the low unemployment rate - which wouldn't prevail if the automation story were true - is giving workers at the middle and the bottom a bit more of the bargaining power they require to achieve real wage gains. The median weekly wage has risen at an annual average rate, after adjusting for inflation, of 1.5 per cent over the past four years. For workers at the bottom end of the wage ladder (the 10th percentile), it has risen 2.8 per cent annually, boosted also by minimum wage increases in many states and cities.\n\nTo be clear, these are not outsize wage gains, and they certainly are not sufficient to reverse four decades of wage stagnation and rising inequality. But they are evidence that current technologies are not preventing us from running hotter-for-longer labour markets with the capacity to generate more broadly shared prosperity.\n\nNational minimum wage hikes will further boost incomes at the bottom. Stronger labour unions will help ensure that workers get a fairer share of productivity gains. Still, many toiling in low-wage jobs, even with recent gains, will still be hard-pressed to afford child care, health care, college tuition and adequate housing without significant government subsidies.\n\nContrary to those hawking the automation story, faster productivity growth - by boosting growth and pretax national income - would make it easier to meet these challenges. The problem isn't and never was automation. Working with better technology to produce more efficiently, not to mention more sustainably, is something we should obviously welcome.\n\nThe thing to fear isn't productivity growth. It's false narratives and bad economic policy.\n\nJared Bernstein, chief economist to former vice president Joe Biden, is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
