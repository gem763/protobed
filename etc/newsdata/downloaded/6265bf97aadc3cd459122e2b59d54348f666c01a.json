Subs not used: Politano, Lazaro, Padelli, Bastoni. Goals: Martinez (22), Candreva (89) Booked: Godin, Barella, Brozovic, Candreva BORUSSIA DORTMUND: Burki, Hummels, Weigl, Witsel, Akanji (Bruun Larsen 74), Hakimi, Delaney (Dahoud 65), Schulz, Sancho, Brandt, Hazard (Guerreiro 84). Subs not used: Zagadou, Gotze, Piszczek, Hitz. Booked: Weigl, Hummels Referee: Anthony Taylor (England)\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sport Italia following the win, goalscorer Candreva said: 'There is great enthusiasm at the moment and the desire to do well, to improve, to suffer all together.\n\n'We must continue like this. Today was a great game. We will celebrate until midnight and then will turn our attention back to the league.\n\n'It was a truly a great test. We must keep our focus and cannot relax.\n\n'We know that the qualification is still possible for all teams in the group.'\n\nMartinez is in fine form following his brace against Sassuolo at the weekend and he reacted quickest after 22 minutes to score the opener on the stretch.\n\nChances for both sides dried up for long periods thereafter before Martinez was handed the chance to get his \u2014 and Inter's \u2014 second from the penalty spot with less than 10 minutes remaining.\n\nThe Argentine striker took his time but saw his thunderous strike saved impressively by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki.\n\nAntonio Conte was frustrated at the opportunity being passed up but his side continued to be positive, sensing a tired Dortmund were there to be got at.\n\nAnd so it proved with one minute remaining of normal time.\n\nThe visiting supporters made their presence felt with flares being set off in the away section\n\nThirty-two-year-old Candreva showed the pace of his younger days to lose his marker and with Martinez screaming for the ball to be rolled across the box, the winger picked out the top corner of the net to seal victory in style.\n\n'Borussia Dortmund changed their system to five at the back, which means they were afraid of us and wanted to play by changing their approach to mirror ours,' Conte told Sky Sport Italia.\n\n'We had prepared for a very different match, but did well to adjust. When Dortmund switched back to 4-2-3-1 after the break, we adjusted again and took control.\n\n'We had prepared to press them in certain areas of the pitch and they changed their system, so that was no longer valid. The most important thing I told the lads was not to lose possession in central areas, as that is where they push forward on the counter.'\n\nVictory puts Inter in second ahead of the meeting with Dortmund at the Westfalenstadion in two weeks time with both sides competing to progress alongside Barcelona, with many expecting the La Liga giants to coast through to the knockout stages.\n\nMartinez blew the chance to score his second goal as he saw Roman Burki save his penalty", "description": "INTER MILAN 2-0 BORUSSIA DORTMUND: Antonio Candreva sealed a crucial win for Inter Milan with his first ever Champions League goal as Borussia Dortmund fell flat at the San Siro.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/23/20106044-0-image-a-14_1571868275920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
