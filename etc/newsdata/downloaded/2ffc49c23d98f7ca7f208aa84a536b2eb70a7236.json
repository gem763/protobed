We are currently headed home from the emergency room,\u201d she said in her Instagram Stories, People reports.

'@shawnjohnson broke her toe and was walking on it... 10/10. don\u2019t worry, babes is alright.'\n\nThe video showed Andrew taking off the ice pack on Shawn's foot and revealing the swollen toe underneath.\n\nHe then placed the X-ray picture in front of the camera so viewers could see exactly what part of the toe Shawn broke.\n\n'Mama here smashed her foot with a rock,' Andrew explained during the video.\n\nHe also expressed pride in his wife for her pain tolerance throughout the entire experience, stating doctors initially thought Shawn just bruised the toe because she had no problem with them pulling on it.\n\n'Shawn's a champ,' Andrew said.\n\nThe break: The video also showed the X-ray image (pictured) of the break for viewers\n\nCan't hardly wait: The couple is expecting their first child in the next couple of weeks and decided to keep the gender a secret for everyone until the birth\n\nBefore the accident: The day before Shawn broke her foot she shared an image of herself on a walk to hopefully entice the baby to come out early\n\nThe expectant mom potentially received a ton of worrisome comments online following the release of the hospital pictures, because she later released a video on Monday to her Instagram Stories to reassure any followers.\n\n'Guys, I\u2019m great, I promise\u2026my foot is a little bit bigger than usual, my toe is a little bit longer than usual,' she said.\n\nTalent: Des Moines, Idaho-native Shawn won a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing\n\n'But I\u2019m good. It is just the perfect excuse to chill out until the baby comes.'\n\nShawn is currently expecting her first child with her husband.\n\nThe couple films videos for YouTube and previously stated in one clip they were not going to have a dramatic gender reveal.\n\nInstead, they decided together that it would be fun to have the gender of their child remain a surprise to everyone, including themselves, until delivery.\n\nThe day before Shawn broke her toe she shared an image of herself on a walk in hopes it would convince her unborn child to come early.\n\n'Walks on walks... comeeee on babyyyy,' Shawn wrote at the time.\n\nBut Shawn will now have to come up with new techniques to entice the baby to come out since her daily walks are not possible with the broken toe for at least a few weeks.", "description": "Shawn, 28, is 38 weeks pregnant and broke her toe on Sunday from a rock.
