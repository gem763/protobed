Biggs on Durham Probe: Certain People \u2018Ought to Be Concerned\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Friday during an appearance on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cYour World,\u201d Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) explained why now that the probe led by the Department of Justice\u2019s John Durham meant certain players that were alleged to have interfered with the 2016 presidential election should \u201cbe concerned.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, The New York Times reported the probe was now a criminal investigation. Biggs told fill-in host Charles Payne a number of those individuals could come under the scrutiny of Durham.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nPAYNE: So what do you make of these latest developments? It feels like the table, or the tide may be turning something \u2014 somewhat here.\n\nBIGGS: Well, I think it\u2019s interesting.\n\nI mean, I always viewed this as kind of a quasi-criminal investigation that Durham was doing. And I think it really takes it into a grand jury setting. And that\u2019s going to be interesting to see what comes out of there, because that\u2019s where, if criminal charges are going to occur, they\u2019re going to rise right through that criminal jury \u2014 excuse me \u2014 that grand jury hearing system.\n\nPAYNE: Yes. It\u2019s \u2014 there was always a lot of frustration about the origins of this investigation.\n\nBIGGS: Yes.\n\nPAYNE: And even more so after the Mueller report was released.\n\nAnd now some folks believe that there was a deliberate attempt to investigate then-candidate Trump, because of concerns that he would become president of the United States. In your mind, does that reach the level of criminality?\n\nBIGGS: Well, I think it does.\n\nFirst of all, in order to investigate like that, somebody has to give the approval. And they have to \u2014 they have to get FISA warrants, which is what they did here. They have to go before a court. They have to state things that are accurate, under oath \u2014 penalty of perjury. That was done here.\n\nThey\u2019re not allowed to spy. Some of these intelligence agencies are not allowed to spy directly on Americans. And they were doing this for political purposes. If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s some various \u2014 there\u2019s various criminal statutes that are going to come into play here.\n\nThey should be concerned. There were some people that you mentioned your last segment that I think ought to be concerned. There\u2019s others that were not mentioned that ought to be concerned.\n\nPAYNE: Well, who are they, sir? Who are some of other ones we didn\u2019t mention?\n\nBIGGS: I would look at Bruce and Nellie Ohr. I think I\u2019m very concerned about those guys.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t remember if you mentioned McCabe. I think McCabe should be concerned. I would even suggest that DAG, former DAG Rod Rosenstein should be concerned because he signed off on\u2026\n\nPAYNE: Really?\n\nBIGGS: Yes, he signed off on at least one of those \u2014 those FISA warrants.", "description": "Friday during an appearance on Fox News Channel's \"Your World,\" Rep.
