T stock\u2019s dividend yield of 51 cents per share, currently yielding 5.5%, has been thought unsustainable by many analysts. Since AT&T stock has 7.31 billion shares outstanding, the dividend costs almost $15 billion per year to maintain.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo that $15 billion, add interest on $159 billion of long-term debt as of June 30, plus a capital budget of $23 billion and something\u2019s got to give.\n\nThat something, according to recent media reports, could be DirecTv, the satellite service. DirecTv cost AT&T $49 billion in 2015 but has lost 2.5 million subscribers in the last year. Trouble is, neither a spin-off nor a sale to DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) would bring in anywhere near $49 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson\u2019s planned glorious retirement next year is beginning to look more like former General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Jeff Immelt\u2019s more ignominious exit.\n\nThe Debt\n\nAs I wrote back in July and repeated after Elliott Management proposed big changes this month, AT&T has an enormous technology debt, in addition to its financial debt.\n\nTake a walk outside and you\u2019ll likely see some of it. Those copper wires hanging on those old wooden poles are obsolete. Telephony is dying. International long distance calls are free with Skype, and even teleconferencing is free with Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM).\n\nEven when upgraded with fiber to deliver TV, the value of AT&T\u2019s physical network is deteriorating. That\u2019s in part thanks to AT&T itself, which is in the process of upgrading its mobile service to 5G. But the value of that is open to question, as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) makes its Google Fi a better deal.\n\nDo I have to mention the plans of Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos to create global internet access with low-Earth orbit satellites?\n\nThe Mistake of the Century\n\nIn a 2016 New York Times profile of Randall Stephenson, he ordered his brother, a career lineman, to learn about the cloud.\n\nBut Stephenson didn\u2019t buy or build cloud. He sold the company\u2019s data centers in 2018 and is putting his operations on the IBM (NYSE:IBM) cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\nStephenson decided cloud was too expensive and risky early in the decade while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was investing in cloud before it had the cash flow to justify it. Today Facebook is worth twice AT&T.\n\nThe lack of cloud investment was as big a mistake as GE\u2019s decision to buy Alstom, a French turbine maker, in 2015. That was hailed as the \u201cbest deal in a century,\u201d but GE Power has since made GE a shadow of its former self.\n\nStephenson\u2019s plan was to use the content agreements of DirecTv, later the content of Time Warner, to keep people on his services at high and rising prices. He assumed he could license that content to other providers, also for high and rising prices. Since the Time Warner purchase Stephenson has been pushing other players hard, dropping services like NFL Network and even threatening to shut off Disney\u2019s (NYSE:DIS) ESPN. The company is also being accused of setting up fake DirecTv accounts, a charge reminiscent of the Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) scandals.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nElliott Management wants to rearrange deck chairs on the Titanic. The appearance of change, the sale of some assets, could boost AT&T\u2019s stock price and let Elliott exit its $3.2 billion investment with a profit.\n\nBut the problems would remain. The technology debt would remain. Much of the financial debt would remain.\n\nAT&T is doomed.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.
