But I\u2019m happy to sit down and talk with you if you\u2019d like,\u201d he wrote in a Saturday tweet responding to a post from Gillis, who was announced earlier this week as one of the program\u2019s latest additions.\n\nYang, who is Asian, added that rather than penalize Gillis by firing him, he should be shown forgiveness.\n\n\u201cFor the record, I do not think he should lose his job,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive. We are all human.\u201d\n\nFor the record, I do not think he should lose his job. We would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive. We are all human. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 14, 2019\n\nOn Thursday, just after news broke that Gillis would be an \u201cSNL\u201d regular, freelance comedy reporter Seth Simmons tweeted footage of a 2018 podcast interview in which Gillis uses the slur \u201cchinks\u201d to describe Chinese people and mocks their speech.\n\nHours after the clip appeared online, drawing backlash, Gillis released a nonapology in which he neglected to unequivocally acknowledge that his remarks were offensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a comedian who pushes boundaries,\u201d he said. \u201cI sometimes miss.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Gillis said he\u2019s \u201chappy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Vice reported that Gillis had again used the slur while taking aim at Yang in podcast recorded in May, calling the candidate a \u201cJew chink.\u201d\n\nGillis will be one of three new faces on \u201cSNL,\u201d including Bowen Yang, a former staff writer whose promotion makes him the show\u2019s fourth Asian cast member after Nasim Pedrad, who was born in Iran, and Fred Armisen and Rob Schneider, who are of Asian descent.", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate is inviting Shane Gillis to meet with him after the comedian's racist Asian jokes surfaced online.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7d30362400002e2a7a556b.jpeg?cache=hfzo0zubxm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
