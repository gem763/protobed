I have been dating a guy for the past few months now named Maurice,' she explained.\n\n'My boyfriend dumped me for Love Island Australia!' Last Tuesday, she unleashed, posting a fiery tell-all uploaded to YouTube\n\n'In the past two weeks, everyone's realised he's not in my socials and then boom he's on this dating show,' the visibly-irate blonde huffed.\n\nShe proceeded to claim that Maurice had lied in his official Love Island bio when he claimed he's been single for six months.\n\n'Did he lie in his bio?

Explaining that Maurice (right) has always had aspirations to become an actor, Christie (left) said she didn't hesitate to encourage him to appear in the advertisement\n\n'About one week after he's gone on this ad, he's broken it off with me!' she exclaimed, adding that his sudden dumping was 'completely out of the blue'.\n\n'His excuse was saying that he puts work first and he can't really prioritise me,' she said.\n\nThe social media star then addressed the question of whether Maurice had applied to appear on Love Island Australia while they were still dating.\n\nPointing out that the show is based in Fiji, Christie said: 'You have to apply for your visa two weeks before you travel there.'\n\n'To me it makes no sense. He's ended love to go find love on the show': Maurice features prominently on Christie's Instagram page, and is seen in various amorous poses with the blonde\n\nIt's war! Christie savagely labelled Maurice (pictured) as 'trash' on Instagram during last Monday's premiere\n\n'Maurice would have had to apply for his visa, keep his passport and apparently you even have to apply for the Love Island position itself months in advance.'\n\n'So if that is all the case he would have 100 per cent have had to apply for this while we were together,' she added.\n\nMaurice features prominently on Christie's Instagram page, and is seen in various amorous poses with the blonde.\n\nThe last photo of the couple was uploaded to her page in August.", "description": "Love Island Australia's Maurice Salib, 27, DENIED he was in a relationship two weeks prior to going on the show.", "authors": ["Kristy Johnson", "Monique Friedlander For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/11/19687406-0-image-a-19_1571049030354.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
