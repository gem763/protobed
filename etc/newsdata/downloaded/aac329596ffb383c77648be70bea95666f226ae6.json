If the conditions are broken, offenders can be sent back to jail.\n\nTypes of prison sentences given out by the courts England and Wales, non-motoring offences\n\nHowever, some prison sentences, known as suspended sentences, involve no time in prison at all.\n\nFor the entirety of a suspended sentence, the offender must abide by certain conditions outside prison, with the threat of imprisonment if these are breached.\n\nHow long do offenders spend in prison?\n\nThose placed in immediate custody by the courts go straight to jail.\n\nFor about 90% of such sentences, an automatic release is granted half-way through the sentence.\n\nThe offender is then on licence for the remainder of it.\n\nAverage prison sentence for selected offences Number of months, England and Wales\n\nFor example, if someone is given a four-year sentence for robbery, they will spend two years in prison and two years outside.\n\nEarly release has been around for a number of decades. It is intended to allow some rehabilitation in the community, while keeping release dates consistent and prison numbers down.\n\nNumber of prison sentences handed out by length England and Wales, all offences\n\nThose guilty of more serious crimes - such as serious sexual assaults or grievous bodily harm - will spend a greater part of their sentence in jail. This will normally be two-thirds of their sentence and they will require approval from the parole board to gain early release.\n\nThe parole board will decide whether or not the offender is safe to return into society. This decision is based on evidence from victims, health professionals, prison staff and the offender themselves.\n\nWhat sentences can certain crimes carry?\n\nWhat is a life sentence?\n\nA life sentence rarely means life in prison. On average, those sentenced to life spend 17 years in jail.\n\nHowever, these offenders will be on licence until they die and expected to meet certain conditions.\n\nNumber of people released from life sentences and time served Mandatory life sentences, England and Wales\n\nThose convicted of murder will always be given a life sentence. The judge then sets the minimum amount of time they must serve before being considered for parole.\n\nThe minimum the judge sets depends on the nature of the murder.\n\nTypical minimum prison terms for murderers over the age of 21 include:\n\n30 years: for a \"sexual or sadistic\" murder, or killing done in the course of personal gain, such as a robbery\n\nfor a \"sexual or sadistic\" murder, or killing done in the course of personal gain, such as a robbery 25 years: for a murder involving a knife or other weapon\n\nfor a murder involving a knife or other weapon 15 years: for most other murders\n\nJudges can increase or decrease these set terms based on factors including whether the murderer was provoked or if the crime was premeditated.\n\nCan offenders spend the rest of their life in jail?\n\nYes, for the most extreme murder cases.\n\nCurrently, a whole-life order is also used for the murder of a police officer or a political killing.\n\nThey are also used when a child has been killed in the most extreme circumstances.\n\nThere are currently 63 people serving whole life sentences, including Rosemary West, who was convicted of murdering 10 people with her husband, Fred West, and the murderers of Labour MP Jo Cox and Fusilier Lee Rigby.\n\nWhat does the government want to change?\n\nThe automatic early release of some violent or sexual offenders at the half-way point of their sentence would be scrapped, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told the Tory conference.\n\nThese offenders would be required to serve two-thirds of their sentence behind bars.\n\nThe Telegraph newspaper has also reported \"whole-life orders\" for murderers of young children would become the norm.", "description": "The Conservatives are promising tougher sentences - but how does society decide who goes to jail?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11822/production/_109041717_gettyimages-527434282.jpg"}
