Usually, I\u2019m writing about social or political issues, interviewing people across the U.K. and the world about their experiences and lives. But here I am, to gush to you about the love of my life: my Knomo backpack. I found my Knomo the way anyone does: through creepily targeted adverts on Instagram. I was clicking around backpacks on other sites, and suddenly Knomo began to appear in my feed. I remember thinking the bags were expensive at first. And it\u2019s true, they are, with backpacks costing at least \u00a399, compared to \u00a340 for a Herschel. But when I saw how the Knomo Beauchamp backpacks are designed to fit a laptop, trainers, notepad, and more, it looked like a winner.\n\nLet me explain. I don\u2019t carry a lot with me when I report, so you\u2019d think any old backpack would do the job \u2014 but I\u2019ve been through quite a few. I love Herschel backpacks, but the ones with a laptop-holder area are too bulky, and the ones without have no compartments at all \u2014 meaning it can cause a total fluster trying to dig to the bottom of the bag, desperately trying to claw around to find my pen.\n\nThe Knomo Beauchamp has multiple compartment areas \u2014 zips at the front, a laptop area, zips inside for more valuable items, side holders, everything. It\u2019s light, durable, and has never let me down. When I was on a bus in Guatemala on a story, I could pull my portable charger out of the front pocket to charge my phone up to rearrange an interview when the bus broke down. And when I sat on a train traveling across Vietnam, I could stash two b\u00e1nh m\u00ecs in my bag along with a ton of other snacks and still had room left. From Hong Kong all the way to the Great Wall of China in Beijing, to my bus through El Salvador up to Mexico, it\u2019s been with me on some of my most memorable journeys. My bag \u2014 the Beauchamp 14-inch backpack, to be specific \u2014 has also shielded my items from the rain with its water-resistant fabric.\n\nThis year, now that I\u2019m based back in (and reporting from) London, I am still hopelessly attached to my bag. And when I\u2019m on the tube, I see a lot of other women with a Knomo bag, which suggests it\u2019s far from being a bag only for travelers \u2014 it\u2019s clearly a commuter bag, too. My bag doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s traveled the world with me \u2014 there are no marks to show where it\u2019s been, but I\u2019m glad I had it with me on the journey. And even if I decided to leave journalism tomorrow, I\u2019d still cling to my bag, as it\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve found that fits the items I need on the go in the city (charger, water bottle, book) without the need to cram them in. Plus, it looks cute.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
