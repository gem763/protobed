It also signed a partnership with U.S. tech firm Cisco to provide technology.\n\nThe project, which was on hold pending approval from the CNIL, called for the installation of so-called biometric portals \u2014 gates equipped with face-scanning tools \u2014 in front of Les Eucalyptus high school in Nice and the Amp\u00e8re high school in Marseille.\n\nThe planned trial was just the latest in a series of experiments with facial recognition in France, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nHowever, according to the CNIL, the plans do not comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe's sweeping privacy rules.\n\n\"Facial recognition processing is an especially intrusive biometric mechanism, which bears important risks of privacy or civil liberties invasions for the people affected,\" the CNIL said.\n\nThe purposes of the use of facial recognition \u2014 to streamline student identification \u2014 can be achieved by other, less intrusive means, the regulator added.\n\n\"It is now up to the region and the high schools, which are responsible for the planned system, to draw consequences,\" the CNIL said.\n\n'Non-binding opinion'\n\nThe South Region's president, Renaud Muselier \u2014 a former MEP from the conservative party Les R\u00e9publicains \u2014 said the CNIL's decision is \"a century late.\"\n\n\"In a world where facial recognition is in the everyday life of millions of smartphone users, refusing projects as simple and ambitious as ours is baffling,\" he said.\n\nThe CNIL's assessment is, however, a victory for digital advocacy groups, teachers' unions and parents, who had waged a campaign to stop the deployment of the biometric portals. Several organizations filed a suit in February before a court in Marseille to annul the region's decision. The case is ongoing.\n\nFrench digital rights group La Quadrature du Net, which led the charge against the high school trials and against facial recognition in France more broadly, applauded the decision.\n\n\"The very principle of facial recognition could therefore be rejected: Too dangerous for our liberties, those automated systems should always be ruled out in the favor of human practices,\" the group said.\n\nEven so, the CNIL's opinion is non-binding and the South Region could still decide to go ahead.\n\n\"With [Nice mayor] Christian Estrosi and my majority, we are going to assess very carefully why the project was refused and analyze what was it that did not suit the CNIL,\" Muselier said. The South Region will file another application as soon as possible, he added.\n\nCisco, the tech company in charge of providing the material for the trial, said in a statement it will \"review the opinion with the Region and work with them as they consider their next steps\u201d.\n\nThe planned trial was just the latest in a series of experiments with facial recognition in France, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nPrivacy regulators are paying close attention, but under the GDPR, their ex-ante authorization is not required to conduct such trials as the users' consent is enough to process biometric data.\n\nIn the absence of specific rules, privacy regulators in Europe are giving case-by-case assessments.\n\nIn Sweden, the data protection authority fined a high school using facial recognition under the GDPR, arguing the students\u2019 consent could not be freely given because the school administration has a moral authority over them. The same authority, however, said earlier this month that the police had \"legitimate\" reasons to use facial recognition.", "description": "Though non-binding, the opinion hands a victory to digital rights groups, parents and teachers\u2019 unions that opposed the experiment.", "authors": ["Laura Kayali", "Mark Scott"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175389276-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
