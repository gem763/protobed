She said that she had been told by the deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, that even though she had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d Trump had been pushing for her departure for months.\n\nYovanovitch, a career diplomat who has served as ambassador under three presidents to three countries, defied a state department instruction not to speak to impeachment investigators. Her decision to appear could trigger a wave of testimony by disaffected officials and the collapse of the administration\u2019s efforts to silence them.\n\nAs she was speaking, reports emerged that more whistleblowers were coming forward in the growing scandal over Trump\u2019s efforts to persuade foreign leaders to deliver compromising information about his political rivals.\n\nThe national security council\u2019s former senior director for Europe and Russia, Fiona Hill, is due to speak to the House committees on Monday. The current ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who is also at the centre of the impeachment row over Trump\u2019s conduct towards Ukraine, has said he will appear on Thursday, also in defiance of the state department gag.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee which is leading the impeachment inquiry, said the committee would \u201caccelerate\u201d its efforts.\n\n\u201cWe expect to announce additional testimony from relevant witnesses in the coming days and remain prepared to compel testimony through duly authorized subpoenas as appropriate,\u201d Schiff wrote in a letter to other members of the committee.\n\nIn her written deposition to Congress, Yovanovitch gave a description of the events surrounding her surprise removal from her post in Kyiv, weeks after having been told in March that the state department wanted her to extend her posting till 2020.\n\n\u201cI was then abruptly told in late April to come back to Washington from Ukraine \u2018on the next plane\u2019,\u201d Yovanovitch wrote. \u201cYou will understandably want to ask why my posting ended so suddenly. I wanted to learn that too, and I tried to find out. I met with the deputy secretary of state who informed me of the curtailment of my term. He said that the president had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch said the deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, \u201cadded that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the summer of 2018\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause,\u201d Yovanovitch said.\n\n\u201cAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the US government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nThe former ambassador, who since her removal has been on academic sabbatical at Georgetown University, went on to talk more generally about the crisis of morale at the state department. She said: \u201cI have served this nation honorably for more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cWe repeatedly uproot our lives, and we frequently put ourselves in harm\u2019s way to serve this nation. And we do that willingly, because we believe in America and its special role in the world. We also believe that, in return, our government will have our backs and protect us if we come under attack from foreign interests,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: Ukraine texts show how Trump has warped the state department\n\n\u201cThat basic understanding no longer holds true. Today, we see the state department attacked and hollowed out from within.\u201d", "description": "* Marie Yovanovitch defies White House to testify  * State department \u2018attacked and hollowed out from within\u2019  * Profile: who is former Ukraine envoy Marie Yovanovitch?Marie Yovanovitch told Congress: \u2018I was incredulous that the US government chose to remove an ambassador based on unfounded and false", "authors": ["Julian Borger In Washington"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/emuV39yINMpDHE6nwJK_AQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9c1a9bd34288d2566af2333ed585934d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
