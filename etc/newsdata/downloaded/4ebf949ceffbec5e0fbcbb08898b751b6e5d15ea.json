It has been common in the past for organisations to use behavioural interventions to nudge consumers toward a particular product. This is a very undesirable practice.\"\n\nHerbert Smith Freehills partner Michael Vrisakis suggested the case means the business model of distributing products on the basis of general advice is now \"on life support\", but Dr Nehme said banks and financial services providers could continue to operate under a general advice allowance despite the legal precedent.\n\n\"I do not think it will have an impact on genuine general advice that is provided in a proper manner and as such it does not mean that this type of advice is unviable,\" she said.\n\nThe verdict should accurately be read not as a repudiation of the general advice model, but of the specific conduct of Westpac's Super Activation Team in advising customers it was in their interests to join Westpac-owned, BT-branded funds, Dr Nehme said.\n\n\"Any financial services organisation that has or is planning to implement a similar strategy as the one applied by Westpac would be impacted,\" she said.\n\nKeep it impersonal\n\nBrett Walker, a compliance consultant to financial services firms and former investigator at ASIC predecessor the Australian Securities Commission, agreed that true general advice \u2014 where consumers are simply provided factual information about a product \u2014 can survive after this verdict. The problem arises where an element of personalisation is introduced, which can easily occur over the phone, he said.\n\n\"Too many features of Westpac's interactions were indicative of personal advice,\" Mr Walker said. \"All the disclaimers in the world could not overcome that conclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There is a lesson here to anyone thinking general advice is a feasible tool to market anything that has a hint of personalised attention.\"\n\nLearning from the past\n\nObservers and analysts said the verdict's business impact was muted by the fact that the big four banks are in varying stages of exiting from the wealth management business, meaning the cross-selling of superannuation and other managed funds is less of a revenue priority in the future.\n\nHowever, Westpac is holding onto its BT superannuation and funds management business though it is offloading personal financial advice, and Commonwealth Bank has suspended its slated wealth divestment, meaning it is keeping both its superannuation and financial advice assets for the time being.\n\nMorningstar banking sector analyst Nathan Zaia expects that the court's decision could impact Westpac's inflows, given that the problematic super rollovers in dispute contributed $640 million to funds under management.\n\nHowever, he said any expectation that this kind of revenue would continue is misguided, given the broader move away from conflicted financial advice.\n\n\"After the royal commission I would be very surprised if Westpac was making business cases based on the sorts of practices continuing,\" Mr Zaia said.\n\nMatthew Wilson of Evans & Partners agreed that revenue expectations should not be reliant on pre-Hayne lucrative but high-risk sales practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Banks need to take more care with the future provision of advice,\" he said. \"Not everything needs to be industrialised.\"", "description": "The Federal Court verdict in ASIC's dispute with Westpac over super rollovers could eradicate the common practice of phone-based sales in financial services", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2607%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/255f2a47ce13ffb0e22c92ea8595051f4468ccd9", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
