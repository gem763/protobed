J&J claims the level of asbestos detected was \u201cno greater than 0.00002 [percent].\u201d\n\nThe recall affects Lot No. 22318RB, the company said.\n\nTACO BELL RECALLED 2.3M POUNDS OF SEASONED BEEF DUE TO 'METAL SHAVING' FOUND IN MEAT, RESTAURANT CONFIRMS\n\nA spokesperson for the company, Ernie Knewitz, told The New York Times that the recall marks the first time its baby powder has ever been pulled from the market.\n\nThe company said in the statement that is has \u201ca rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe and years of testing, including the FDA\u2019s own testing on prior occasions \u2013 and as recently as last month \u2013 found no asbestos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos. Our talc comes from ore sources confirmed to meet our stringent specifications that exceed industry standards. Not only do we and our suppliers routinely test to ensure our talc does not contain asbestos, our talc has also been tested and confirmed to be asbestos-free by a range of independent laboratories, universities and global health authorities,\u201d it added.\n\nBut the recall comes as J&J fights thousands of lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim its iconic baby powder was contaminated with asbestos and that it caused ovarian cancer or another rare cancer. At multiple trials, J&J experts have testified asbestos hasn't been detected in the talc in its baby powder in many tests over four decades.\n\nErik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on corporate governance, told The Times the recall will hurt the company\u2019s defense claims in court.\n\nAs a result, J&J could \u201close more suits and pay more to settle,\u201d Gordon added.\n\nPUBLIX RECALLS WHITE AMERICAN CHEESE OVER 'FOREIGN MATERIAL' CONCERNS\n\nAsbestos is a \u201cnaturally occurring mineral that is often found near talc, an ingredient in many cosmetic products,\u201d according to the FDA. But in some cases \u2013 typically if the fibers are released into the air \u2013 they can enter a person\u2019s body and subsequently become trapped in the lungs or in the digestive tract if swallowed, according to Oregon State University.\n\nThe body cannot break down these fibers once they are stuck, which is why exposure to asbestos can cause serious health issues including asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma, the university states.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Johnson & Johnson on Friday announced a voluntary recall of a single lot of its baby powder over concerns they product may contain asbestos.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
