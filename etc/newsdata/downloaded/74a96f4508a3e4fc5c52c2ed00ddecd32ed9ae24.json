The redundancies are on hold while WeWork refinances but are expected soon.\n\nThe emergency refinancing proposals come only two months after Neumann prepared to float the company.\n\nEarlier this year some bankers had predicted WeWork could be worth as much as $65bn, valuing Neumann\u2019s stake at $14bn. However, after the publication of the share sale prospectus investors began to question WeWork\u2019s business model, its huge losses and Neumann\u2019s sometimes eccentric behaviour.\n\nNeumann holds special voting shares that enable him to dismiss dissident directors, which prompted concern among investors when the company was preparing for its flotation. His voting rights, which initially gave him 20 times the voting power of other shareholders, were cut to three times those of ordinary shares when he stepped down as chief executive last month.\n\nNeumann has also previously taken $700m out of the company through personal loans and stock sales.\n\nThe initial public offering (IPO) was pulled in September after WeWork\u2019s valuation was slashed by more than half. The company\u2019s valuation will be cut to about $8bn under the refinancing plan.\n\nSign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nUnder the terms of the rescue deal, Marcelo Claure, SoftBank\u2019s chief operating officer, would become chairman. The Japanese conglomerate would end up owning 60% to 80% of WeWork under the proposal, which includes $5bn of new debt, as well as injecting $1.5bn in equity and an offer to buy up to $3bn of existing shares.\n\nThere is a rival funding package also on the table, from JP Morgan Chase, worth $5bn. That deal includes $2bn of unsecured debt. The board will decide on Tuesday which one to accept.\n\nWithout an injection of new funds, the company risks running out of cash by the end of November.\n\n.", "description": "Payout comes as US office-sharing company weighs up sacking about 2,000 people", "authors": ["Julia Kollewe", "Dominic Rushe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e1752b8b56438e2b9721f002b76a763eaded5f/17_28_3480_2088/master/3480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26b9b4e57392e3da0c540e3d4cf0b2bd", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
