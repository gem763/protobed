The funding will cover both a consultation and a pilot program in North Wales.\n\nNot a new idea\n\nThe idea behind the project is based on the Sardex: a mutual credit system implemented on the Italian island and region of Sardinia.\n\nEifion Williams, the CEO of the company behind the Welsh digital currency, praises the Sardinian system and claims that it \u201cbenefited the Sardinian SME economy to the tune of 50m euros last year alone.\u201d\n\nResearch fellow at the London School of Economics and Sardex founder Paolo Dini supports the project and notes similarities between the two regions.\n\nWilliams also explains that just like Sardinia, the vast majority of the economy of Wales is fueled by SMEs, so the idea can boost the Welsh economy as well. He added:\n\n\u201cIf Wales had initiated a copy of the Sardex in 2008, and it had followed the same growth trajectory, Welsh SMEs would now be strengthened to the tune of \u00a3256m in additional turnover.\u201d\n\nA resilient local economy\n\nDeputy Minister for Economy and Transport Lee Waters also explains that the government\u2019s economic action plan \u201csets out the direction for a broader and more balanced approach to economic development focused on making communities stronger and more resilient.\u201d\n\nHe notes that the fund that the project has been financed with plays a crucial role in this plan:\n\n\u201cThe Foundational Economy Challenge Fund is fundamental to this and I\u2019m intrigued to see the results of this mutual credit system pilot by Circular Economy Wales.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in July, also Busan, South Korea's second-most populous city after Seoul, is considering the launch of a local cryptocurrency.", "description": "Wales will be funding the development of a local cryptocurrency to boost the local economy, particularly small and medium enterprises", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZmU4YzY5ODkwZTc2ZDNjNzk3YmY1MjkwNGQ4ZWQ0ZDEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
