As would school children with XR banners in a park. The ban seems draconian and extremely heavy handed even given previous disruption.\n\n\"We have a right to free speech under article 10 and to free assembly under article 11 of the (annex to the) Human Rights Act. These can only be interfered with if the interference is lawful and proportionate. I think the police may have gone too far here.\"\n\nIn response to the police action, an Extinction Rebellion (XR) statement said its \"rebels\" would take \"a moment to pause and remember why we are here\".\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt added: \"Extinction Rebellion will let the Trafalgar Square site go tonight.\n\n\"The International Rebellion continues.\"\n\nOn Twitter, XR's London branch labelled the clearing of protesters from the square as \"an outrage\".\n\nIt also tweeted: \"Today, an unprecedented, political, decision has been taken to shut down peaceful protest calling out the government for inaction in the face of crisis.\"\n\nAs of 5pm on Monday, police said there had been 1,445 arrests in connection with the eight days of XR protests in London.\n\nMr Taylor said officers had made more than 90 arrests on Monday as protesters targeted the City of London, the capital's financial district.\n\nOn Monday night in Trafalgar Square, four people in a so-called peace tent, who had locked themselves together, were cut out of their locks with machinery.\n\nPam Williams, 71, glued herself to the spot where her tent stood as police arrived to take it.\n\nShe said: \"I'm refusing to leave and I've glued myself to the ground. My husband has taken away the tent, the police haven't got it. I shall stay here until I'm arrested.\"\n\nMEP Ms Chowns said she was arrested after \"standing in solidarity\" with protesters in Trafalgar Square.", "description": "The group have vowed to continue their protests with co-founder Gail Bradbrook climbing the entrance to the Department for Transport", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20583386.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Extinction-Rebellion-Climate-Change-Action-In-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
