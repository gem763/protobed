Draghi advises Lagarde", "language": "en", "text": "Under him, the ECB abandoned its roots in German monetary orthodoxy, pushing the interest on bank deposits well below zero and buying \u20ac2.6 trillion worth of assets, mostly government bonds.\n\nDraghi has credited this policy with averting deflation in the euro zone and helping create 11 million jobs in the bloc.\n\nBut more than a third of the ECB's Governing Council opposed a decision to resume bond purchases at the September meeting, and policymakers from the Netherlands, France and Germany took the unusual step of making their disagreement public.\n\nAnd it's not just a few prominent hawks who question the wisdom of even more bond buys.\n\nSome 95 per cent of respondents in a Reuters poll of analysts said the stimulus package would not significantly help in bringing inflation back to the ECB's target of just under 2 per cent.\n\nThe ECB made no new policy moves on Thursday, having decided in September to restart bond purchases at a pace of \u20ac20 billion per month while also cutting its deposit rate to -0.5 per cent and keeping the door open to further reductions.\n\nDespite weak growth across the euro zone, Draghi insisted the benefits of loose money policy far outweighed the risks and rejected the suggestion that the public spat had tainted his legacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Every jurisdiction has disagreements when monetary policy decisions come to be discussed,\" Draghi said.\n\nHe added dissenters seemed to bury the hatchet at Thursday's meeting, with one calling for unity and another saying that \"bygones are bygones\".\n\nA source at the meeting said the climate was more consensual than in September, with dissenters refraining from bringing up their concerns again when the policy proposal was made.\n\nLagarde has to energise a sluggish euro-area economy. Bloomberg\n\nYet turmoil within the ECB was likely to persist, and Lagarde will have to deal with objections that the ultra-easy policy hurts savers, squeezes banks and pension funds and inflates financial bubbles while doing little for inflation.\n\nThis was just 0.8 per cent in September, a far cry from the ECB's target of below but close to 2 per cent.\n\nThis goal may change under Lagarde, who has pledged to review the ECB's strategy, following in the footsteps of the US Federal Reserve.\n\n\"She may wait until a review of the ECB's monetary policy has been conducted in order to decide if Draghi's motto remains valid,\" said Rene Albrecht, an analyst at DZ Bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem for the ECB is that some of the major factors depressing prices are outside its control.\n\nThese range from demographic and technological changes to the euro zone's reliance on exports, in particular by German manufacturers, which leaves it bearing the brunt of a global trade war.\n\nWith the ECB's firepower now largely spent, Draghi and his successor are likely to continue urging governments that are running surpluses, such as Germany and the Netherlands, to invest more to generate economic growth at home.\n\nBut the latest budget figures showing only a modest expansion suggest these calls are likely to go unheard for now, leaving the burden on the ECB.\n\n\"Monetary policy will continue to do its job,\" Draghi said.\n\nReuters", "description": "The man credited with saving the euro from collapsing kept the door open to even more easy money from his successor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_58/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d98c799f0c7639a683397f315790ae9812e2da69", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
