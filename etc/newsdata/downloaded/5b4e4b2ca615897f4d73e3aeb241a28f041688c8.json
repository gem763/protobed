But what about your car insurance policy or your tax returns?\n\nPeople need to assume they won\u2019t be back for a very long time.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency as multiple wildfires burned across the state, including a massive blaze in the state\u2019s wine country and other fires around Los Angeles and San Francisco. Nearly 200,000 people were ordered to evacuate because of a fire burning in Sonoma County, and more residents in other parts of the state could be forced to leave their homes on a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nThree fires alone \u2014 the Kincade, Tick and Getty fires \u2014 are threatening nearly 1,000 homes, which would cost around $535 million to reconstruct, according to an analysis from property data firm CoreLogic.\n\nRead more: Major flooding in the South is a cautionary tale for all homeowners\n\nFor the millions of residents across the Golden State, having a \u201cfinancial go bag\u201d ready will be crucial to ensure that they can bounce back financially after a wildfire if it destroys their home. And that\u2019s certainly a possibility. The Camp Fire, which burned last year, destroyed 18,804 structures, including the entire town of Paradise, Calif.\n\nPeople need to assume they won\u2019t be back for a very long time, said Tiffany Ballard, a wealth manager with Bergland Wealth Management, based in Ridgeland, Miss. There is a temptation to take bare essentials in a waterproof bag, she said. \u201cThe better alternative is storing critical files in a portable bin that stays ready to be packed in the car for travel,\u201d she said.\n\nMarketWatch asked personal-finance experts and financial advisers what they should include to secure their finances during and after a natural disaster:\n\nPack IDs, medical documents and wills\n\nBring IDs such as a driver\u2019s license, passport, Social Security card or birth certificate for all members of the household. Also pack health insurance cards and emergency contact information for friends or relatives. People should also bring along anything they would normally keep in their wallets, including credit cards.\n\nMedical information is critical, including copies of prescriptions, medicine lists and contact information for doctors. To prepare for the absolute worst, travel with estate documents, such as their will or power of attorney.\n\nWith power outages, cash is king in a natural disaster.\n\nCash is king in a natural disaster. With power outages likely, many businesses won\u2019t be able to accept credit cards. And leaving cash behind is a dicey proposition when one\u2019s home is at risk. \u201cDo you like to keep an abundance of cash available? If so, be sure to grab it to avoid losing it in a flood or fire,\u201d said Tad Herrington, a senior financial planner with private financial planning firm John E. Sestina and Co. in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nGiven that banks may remain closed for an extended period of time and ATMs may be damaged depending on the severity of the disaster, consumers should plan to take a sizeable amount of cash. Ideally, they should split the money among responsible members of their household and carry it in a traveler\u2019s money belt for safe keeping, said Ken Robinson, senior adviser at Practical Financial Planning, an advisory firm located in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nIf any bills or regular monthly payments are not set up for auto-pay, consumers should also bring along their checkbook and addresses for where payments need to be made.\n\nRead more: How to find a contractor after a hurricane\n\nBring along proof of assets\n\nBallard recommends creating a \u201cvital document locator. \u201cThis is a simple document that details a summary of one\u2019s financial life in the event of a sudden loss,\u201d she said.\n\nPack all insurance policies and deeds to any property or vehicle titles.\n\nPack all insurance policies and deeds to any property or vehicle titles.\n\nAlso bring bank and investment account statements, including contact information for the relevant financial institutions, information regarding any outstanding loans, tax returns from recent years and any paper stock certificates or bonds.\n\nA USB drive with photos or videos of any property to archive its state and contents prior to the disaster is also important to consider. This should be updated regularly, since it will serve as a vital resource when assessing any damages as a result of the natural disaster. The photos and videos also can be uploaded to a cloud service like Dropbox DBX, -0.35% or Google Drive GOOG, -0.15%.\n\nAlso see: Why trip insurance may not help if Hurricane Florence ruins your cruise vacation\n\nDon\u2019t rely on a safe \u2014 do rely on the cloud\n\nEmpty your safe. While a water- and fire-proof safe is good to have, it\u2019s not foolproof. The safe and home may both be destroyed, said Joshua Mungavin, a wealth manager at Evensky & Katz/Foldes Financial, a wealth management firm based in Coral Gables, Fla.\n\nThe safe and home may both be destroyed.\n\nSafe deposit boxes at a bank are one option, but uploading those documents to the cloud is better, experts say. For $75 a year, Everplans provides an encrypted digital archive of financial and estate documents. It also allows users to designate a deputy who can gain access to the information if the account holder is somehow incapacitated.\n\nThe digital note-taking service Evernote can also be used to upload and organize photos and docments, and Cryptee, an encrypted digital cloud service, also allows users to upload documents, photos and videos for safekeeping. A premium Evernote account costs $7.99 for each user per month, while Cryptee costs $3 a month for $10 gigabytes of storage. Free storage options include Google Drive and Dropbox.\n\nConsider carrying passwords with you\n\nIf you\u2019re the type of person who saves their account passwords to their computer and then forgets about them, you need to have a back-up plan in place in case the computer is destroyed. But writing down a password on paper is an extremely risky proposition.\n\nOne option is to save these passwords on an encrypted Microsoft Excel MSFT, +0.58% spreadsheet on a password-protected USB drive. Alternatively, consumers should consider signing up for a password manager. Services like Dashlane or Lastpass only require users to know one password and can be accessed on the go using a mobile device.\n\nThis story was updated on Oct. 30, 2019.", "description": "For the millions of residents across the Golden State, having a \u2018go bag\u2019 ready will be crucial to ensure that they can bounce back financially after a...", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ889_calif__ZG_20171210175227.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-13"}
