What\u2019s unclear is if his new promises will even begin to mitigate the harm he\u2019s already done to farmers\u2019 income.\n\n\u201cThe Farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for Ethanol,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cIt will be a giant package, get ready!\u201d He boasted that he\u2019s also been able \u201cto save the small refineries from certain closing.\u201d\n\nThe Farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for Ethanol, not even including the E-15, year around, which is already done. It will be a giant package, get ready! At the same time I was able to save the small refineries from certain closing. Great for all! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2019\n\nThe tweet follows numerous decisions by the Trump administration that have dramatically hurt farmers. Not only have farmers faced the consequences of the tariffs in Trump\u2019s trade war with China, but his administration also announced this month a new round of waivers for oil refineries to not have to include ethanol in their production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Renewable Fuel Standard requires that oil refineries blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel. As a result, 40% of corn grown in the United States is turned into ethanol. Since taking office, however, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been issuing waivers to to small oil refineries relieving them of this ethanol requirement. Prior to this month, it had issued 54 such waivers, and it has just issued another 31.\n\nAs a result, demand for ethanol has plummeted by an estimated 2.6 billion gallons. And the EPA has so far decided not to raise the annual target for how much corn ethanol will be blended into gasoline, meaning the demand won\u2019t change. The oil industry, unsurprisingly, opposes any efforts to bolster ethanol.\n\nThe waivers have been great for oil refineries, but terrible for ethanol refineries, which have also suffered from the reduced demand. Since Trump\u2019s EPA started issuing the waivers, 16 ethanol plants have shut down or idled, including one in Minnesota just this week and one in Indiana last week. That\u2019s resulted in a loss of more than 2,500 jobs.\n\nWhatever Trump proposes in this new \u201cgiant package\u201d will have to compensate for all of these losses \u2014 on top of damage that\u2019s already been done by the trade war tariffs. In an interview with MSNBC shortly after Trump posted his tweet Thursday, Roger Johnson of the National Farmers Union highlighted just how little the president\u2019s subsidies will compensate for farmers\u2019 losses.\n\n\u201cNet farm income\u2019s been down in the area of $600 billion dollars,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201cAnd so these payments, $12 billion, $16 billion \u2014 yes, they\u2019re needed, they\u2019re important, but they\u2019re not going to make up for the damage and this damage is long-term. It\u2019s going to be decades \u2014 literally \u2014 before we get some of these markets back, if ever.\u201d\n\nWith many farmers who voted for Trump in 2016 now saying they\u2019re so exasperated that they can\u2019t currently support him, his \u201cgiant package\u201d has an incredible amount of damage to undo.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1149359866.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
