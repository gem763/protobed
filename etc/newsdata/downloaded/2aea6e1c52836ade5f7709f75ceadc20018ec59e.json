REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nBiden was questioned at the multi-candidate event on Friday night about his votes as a U.S. senator from Delaware on legislation that included the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy that prohibited openly gay individuals from serving in the U.S. military and a law defining marriage as between a man and a woman.\n\nWhen moderator Lyz Lenz, a columnist with the Cedar Rapids Gazette, one of the event\u2019s sponsors, mentioned that Biden had called Republican Vice President Mike Pence - a religious conservative who as Indiana governor in 2014 signed a state law banning same-sex marriage - a \u201cdecent guy\u201d, the audience booed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of a way in which you usually speak - when we try to get things done - to talk about people,\u201d Biden told Lenz.\n\nThe exchange between Lenz and Biden, the current front-runner to be the Democratic nominee to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November 2020, was the tensest of the night, when 10 of the 19 candidates vying for the nomination discussed LGBTQ issues, including Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who would be the first openly gay U.S. president.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign declined to comment on the forum.\n\nThe former vice president backed \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d as part of a larger defense bill and later voted to remove it. Though Biden also voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, he had previously opposed denying same-sex couples benefits.\n\nHe backed same-sex marriage before former President Barack Obama, for whom he served. And shortly after his statement about Pence, Biden wrote on Twitter that there is \u201cnothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights.\u201d\n\nForum attendees Elle Boeding, Micah McCutchen and Emmett Cory, all 20-something students at the University of Northern Iowa who are involved with the LGBTQ-group UNI Proud, said, though, that the event made them further doubt whether Biden was the best representative for a party that has rapidly evolved on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning/queer issues.\n\nCory questioned Biden\u2019s response that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have to evolve\u201d because he was an early supporter of gay rights.\n\n\u201cI think that he thinks he doesn\u2019t need to, but he does, he can\u2019t just ride (his political history) without having to get with the times,\u201d Cory said.\n\nBoeding was turned off by Biden at times interrupting Lenz, who tweeted that Biden \u201csaid to me dryly, \u2018You\u2019re a real sweetheart,\u2019\u201d as the two walked off stage.\n\n\u201cIn this specific setting, interrupting a woman is a no go ... I don\u2019t know what it will take for him to connect the dots,\u201d Boeding said.\n\nMcCutchen said: \u201cJoe Biden had a bad night.\u201d\n\nBiden is set to attend additional campaign events in Iowa on Saturday, including a multi-candidate steak fry hosted by a county Democratic Party. His appearance at the LGBTQ forum came amid news reports that Trump repeatedly pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden's decades-long record on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues was scrutinized on Friday in Iowa at the first major forum focused on the topic during the 2020 Democratic presidential nominating contest.", "authors": ["Amanda Becker", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432254668&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K05O", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
