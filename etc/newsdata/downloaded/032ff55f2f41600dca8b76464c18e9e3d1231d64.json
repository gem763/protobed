There\u2019s that iPhone case that was actually an entire Android phone, a case that could record all of your voice calls, the one that put an E Ink screen on the back of your iPhone, and a case that served as a lint roller, to name a few.\n\nThankfully, wacky case ideas still live on in 2019, as is made clear by the pitch for the Duo charging case (for both iPhone and Samsung devices). The case\u2019s back has a dedicated spot where you can store your Juul e-cigarette, and it also claims to be able to charge the device (and your phone) with its built-in 3,000mAh battery. So in theory, you should never encounter a dead Juul when you need a puff. Next to it is a spot for an emergency replacement pod for when you run out of vapor juice or want to change flavors.\n\nRelated Everything you ever wanted to know about the vaping health crisis\n\nA note on crowdfunding: Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature: companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a study run by Kickstarter in 2015, roughly 1 in 10 \u201csuccessful\u201d products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there\u2019s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember: you\u2019re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.\n\nI know some people who smoke Juul e-cigs, and they lug around portable battery packs just so they don\u2019t get stranded without a charge when they want to smoke. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing to be around. This case seems like it would solve for that issue, but it\u2019s arguably even more embarrassing. It\u2019s visible on your phone at all times, letting everyone in the world know that you are incredibly committed to vaping. Duo Inc., the company behind this fundraiser, shares the dimensions of the case on its product page, and at 99 grams, this case adds some heft to your phone. Not to mention, it\u2019s 15mm thick, which is nearly twice as thick as the iPhone 11.\n\nDuo Inc. plans to ship the case in December 2019, and early bird pricing for the case is $64 ($84 in Canada). That might seem pricey, but that price is actually 42 percent off of the planned $110 retail price, which is a steep price to pay to streamline your Juul usage to the point of never being separated from it. Once the early bird-priced option sells out, each case will cost $83.\n\n\u201cHow can you enjoy Party Mode if your pod is out of juice?\u201d Duo Inc. posits on its fundraising page. Its case allows you to vape 24/7, and compared to more far-flung case ideas, this one seems simple enough that it might actually ship. But given the rising number of warnings from the Food and Drug Administration about the potential safety hazards of vaping, including seizures and a deadly lung injury, look, maybe you should just quit Juul while you\u2019re still ahead.", "description": "There are plenty of weird phone cases out there, and one of the new ones is the Duo charging case on Indiegogo.
