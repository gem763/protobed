There is unfortunately no surviving a diagnosis of secondary breast cancer, and significant delays in patients getting the treatment and support they need can have a devastating impact.\u201d\n\nBaroness Morgan said improvements in survival from breast cancer, had created a \u201ccomplacency\u201d about the disease, which kills one woman in the UK every 45 minutes.\n\nFour in ten respondents who had spoken to a healthcare professional before being diagnosed with secondary breast cancer said they felt that their symptoms had not been taken seriously.\n\nThe charity called for a \u201cradical shift\u201d in how we think about breast cancer.\n\n\u201cWe need health services to properly cater for the tens of thousands of people living with breast cancer where treatment is no longer curative. We need to guard against complacency in the face of recent advances, and ensure that clear pathways are developed for secondary breast cancer patients, from diagnosis through to care. We cannot let those with secondary breast cancer be written off. For too long now, the worrying perception that everyone survives breast cancer has masked the heart-breaking reality for 11,500 families in the UK that lose someone they love each year.\u201d\n\nThe charity has launched a campaign, the Unsurvivors, calling for better support and training so GPs spot signs of secondary breast cancer.\n\nJo Myatt, 44 from Chorley, was diagnosed with incurable disease in August 2016, 10 years after first being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer.\n\nShe said it took more than five appointments with her GP to even be offered blood tests, despite worrying symptoms, including nausea and fatigue.", "description": "One in four women with incurable breast cancer had to see their GP at least three times before being diagnosed, a landmark report warns.", "authors": ["Laura Donnelly", "Health Editor", "Fraser Nelson", "Penny Mordaunt", "Tom Harris"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/06/16/98850140_File_photo_dated_15-06-06_of_a_consultant_analyzing_a_mammogram_Women_aged_50_to_70_are-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKutH9T4LB0mU7ExMWwW8NCqGxQH04cH4iJu8pVjTmPA.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
