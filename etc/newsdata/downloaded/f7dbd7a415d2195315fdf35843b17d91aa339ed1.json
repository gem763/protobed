(AP) - Kyler Murray spent three quarters stuck in the desert sand as Arizona\u2019s Air Raid erred.\n\nOnce the fourth quarter hit, Murray was masterful.\n\nSo what if the day ended in a tie? Murray had a debut to remember.\n\nLooking every bit like the No. 1 overall pick after a shaky start, Murray rallied the Cardinals from an 18-point fourth-quarter deficit to eke out a 27-all tie against the Detroit Lions on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty ugly at first, but you try to stay the course,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long game. Proud of the way we fought, but unfortunately we couldn\u2019t get the win. A tie\u2019s better than a loss, I guess.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals were one of the most talked-about teams heading into the NFL season. They had Murray, the Heisman Trophy winner and No. 1 overall pick, and Kliff Kingsbury, the former Texas Tech coach attempting to bring the Air Raid offense to the NFL full-time.\n\nTheir debut made Sunday\u2019s game one of the most anticipated in franchise history.\n\nFor three quarters, it looked like a desert disaster.\n\nThe Air Raid, known for producing prodigious numbers in the college game, was more Air Dud, appearing unfit for the NFL as Arizona\u2019s choked and sputtered.\n\nMurray, dynamic with his arm and legs at Oklahoma, seemed not fast enough, tall enough or accurate enough to succeed against bigger, faster NFL players.\n\nUnable to protect Murray or get its run game going, Arizona had 58 yards of offense in the first half. Murray was 6 for 15 for 41 yards with one throw-it-up-for-grabs interception and two balls batted back in his face.\n\nThe third quarter wasn\u2019t much better; Murray was 3 for 9, the Cardinals had 42 yards and trailed 24-6.\n\nAfter keeping the offense vanilla in the preseason to hopefully gain an advantage, it appeared the Air Raid needed a bit more seasoning.\n\n\u201cIt was three quarters of the worst offense I\u2019ve seen in my life,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cAnd it was my fault.\u201d\n\nThen, something clicked. Well, Kingsbury\u2019s play-calling clicked, actually.\n\nGiven all summer to conjure up ways to Air Raid the NFL, the first-year coach went overboard, making things too complicated, too quirky.\n\nOnce Kingsbury simplified his play-calling and personnel packages, Murray and the rest of the Cardinals attacked the Lions instead of waiting to get ambushed.\n\n\u201cWe just started doing what we were good at,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say simple, but just running our stuff and going fast. I think that opened things up.\u201d\n\nFinally able to get into a rhythm, Murray became the piston firing the Cardinals forward. He completed 15 of 19 passes for 154 yards and threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter.\n\nMurray hit David Johnson on a 27-yard pass for his first NFL TD pass, found Larry Fitzgerald on a 4-yard score with 43 seconds left and connected with Christian Kirk on a 2-point conversion to send the game to overtime.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous competitor and to go through that as a rookie in your first start, to find a way to bring his team back says a lot about him,\u201d Kingsbury said.\n\nThe teams traded field goals in overtime, leaving both with an unsatisfying tie.\n\nGiven how bad Murray and the Cardinals were for three quarters, they\u2019ll take it.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyler Murray spent three quarters stuck in the desert sand as Arizona's Air Raid erred.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/lions_cardinals_football_96444_c0-172-4099-2561_s1770x1032.jpg?1c66cc50f1236a7b3cfba650757435fe8c3a7848", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
