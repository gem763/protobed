It is the \u201cold kid on the block\u201d making new highs, as gold looks on.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s trading, on New York Mercantile Exchange\u2019s Comex division got to an all-time high of $1,669.40, before settling down the session down $5.40, or 0.3%, at $1,647.50 per ounce.\n\nPalladium 300-Min Chart - Powered By TradingView\n\nIn September alone, palladium futures gained more than 9%, about the same as the whole of the third quarter.\n\n, reflective of physical trades, hit a record high of $1,702.20 on Monday before ending in negative territory.\n\nPalladium Driven By Supply Deficit Fears, China Auto Market\n\nAnalysts attributed palladium\u2019s outbreak to fears of a supply deficit in the auto-catalyst metal and speculation that the United States could get a trade deal concluded with China\u2014the world\u2019s fastest growing car market\u2014despite the perennial back-and-forth in their negotiations.\n\nSaid Philip Streible, precious metals strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, said:\n\n\u201cHard as it may be to believe, palladium\u2019s run is hinged on the U.S.-China trade deal getting done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market, of course, knows the odds for such a deal, and that it alone cannot sustain palladium\u2019s run higher. I\u2019ll lean more on the supply deficit story for the rally to continue.\u201d\n\nSpecialty metals refiner Johnson Matthey has projected a deficit of 127,000 ounces for 2019, after last year\u2019s record surplus of 375,000 ounces.\n\nJeffrey Christian, managing partner of New York-based CPM Group, was quoted as saying on Reuters:\n\n\u201cThere is strong fabrication demand but a good part of this is speculative demand from investors who expect prices to rise and also people who are getting out of gold, silver and platinum: because those prices are falling, some of them are shifting into palladium.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern that there isn\u2019t a lot of palladium around; a big part of that is people who own the metal don\u2019t want to sell at current prices. They want to see how high the price goes before they keep their profits.\u201d\n\nBottom Falls Out Of Gold\n\nPalladium\u2019s surge also comes as the bottom appears to have fallen out of gold, which plumbed to two-month lows this week after holding firmly above the $1,500 level since early August.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s trade, for December delivery settled down $33.50, or 2.2%, at $1,472.90 per ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The session low was $1,470.65, marking a bottom since Aug. 6.\n\nGold 300-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nGold futures have lost about $100, or more than 6%, since hitting six-year highs of $1,565 on Aug. 26.\n\nAnalysts said gold\u2019s breakdown was triggered by its slide beneath the Sept. 18 low of $1,490.70 on Comex, which broke a key support.\n\nSaid RJO Futures\u2019 Streible:\n\n\u201cWe have a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern now and could go as low as $1,450 if the momentum stays.\u201d\n\nGold was also undone by a rampant dollar. The , measured against a basket of six currencies, surged to four-week highs of 99.113 on Monday as it became the preferred hedge again for investors seeking an insurance againnst the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nThat aside, the yellow metal also lost some of the geopolitical risks that had been prevalent over the past two weeks, especially that in , after Saudi Arabia\u2019s quick action to restore output following the Sept. 14 attack on its energy infrastructure. Riyadh\u2019s stance not to engage militarily with Iran, which it has blamed for the attack, has deprived gold of any war premium risk from the attack.\n\n...Though Some See It Holding Firm\n\nYet, Canadian banking-broking group TD maintained its call for $1,600 gold by the year-end, saying the combination of some 75 technical analysis trading signals suggests that 43% of signals were still tilted toward long gold.\n\nIt added:", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, US Dollar Index Futures, Gold Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
