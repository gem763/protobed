You might think that the gun could be a great equalizer between a petite woman and a large man who\u2019d do her harm, but then you might not have read this hot take the other day from Shailja Patel, who writes for the Guardian and the BBC News, among others.\n\nYou see, if you carry a gun to protect against rapists, you\u2019re not reducing rape \u2026 unless, of course, the guy tries something and you blow him away with your handgun. Then you\u2019ve stopped a rape and very possibly many more rapes that would have occurred in the future had this dirtbag gotten away with it.\n\nOh wait, we\u2019re talking nonsense. If you carry a weapon to defend against rape, you\u2019re just pointing a neon sign at some poor woman who\u2019s not armed, duh.\n\nWhen you tell women and girls to learn self-defense, or carry weapons against rapists, you're not reducing rape. You're just saying \"let him rape someone more vulnerable.\" Stop calling for dystopias. Start working to end patriarchy. Make a world BEYOND RAPE. #Uyinene \u2014 Shailja Patel (@shailjapatel) September 3, 2019\n\nWait, this goes on a bit.\n\nPatriarchy wants us to believe that rape has always existed and always will. That rape is intrinsic to masculinity. This myth serves patriarchy by transferring all consequences of rape, including shame and blame, onto victims. Patriarchy stays unaccountable.#UyineneMrwetyana \u2014 Shailja Patel (@shailjapatel) September 3, 2019\n\nRape culture is how patriarchy sustains the hegemonic myth that rape is a given, an unchangeable condition, of all human societies. So men never have to hold themselves or other men accountable. Rape is a women's issue.#Uyinene \u2014 Shailja Patel (@shailjapatel) September 3, 2019\n\nSo is self-defense. We hear shooting rapists is a great way to cut down on rape culture. But sorry, we interrupted.\n\nRape serves patriarchy by keeping all women scared, ashamed, scrambling for a non-existent safety, and available to men on the most unequal of terms. Patriarchy tells women their best hope of survival lies in being chosen by powerful men who'll protect them.#Uyinene \u2014 Shailja Patel (@shailjapatel) September 3, 2019\n\nYou know what doesn\u2019t keep a woman scared, ashamed, and scrambling for non-existent safety? Owning a firearm and knowing how to use it.\n\nNo, we don\u2019t get it.\n\nYes, ladies, put your guns away and let the rapist have at it, so that he won't seek to rape someone more vulnerable. That is the most ridiculous and lame thing I have ever heard, in my entire life. https://t.co/3dm9UStMy2 \u2014 BayAreaFrau (@bayareahausfrau) September 5, 2019\n\nI'm old enough to remember when @TheDemocrats in Colorado said that gals should pee on themselves to deter rapists.@shailjapatel \u2014 Tom (@BoreGuru) September 5, 2019\n\nShe won't dare say that face to face to rape victims. It's just more leftist \"messaging.\" \u2014 Tera Flop (@teraflopclub) September 5, 2019\n\nHoney, you have no idea of which you speak\u2026zero \u2014 gillian (@gillianbdoll) September 5, 2019\n\nThis is a weird way to admit that unarmed people are soft targets. \u2014 Jake (@Chestys_Ghost) September 5, 2019\n\nTop 5 dumbest things I\u2019ve ever heard easily, probably top 3. \u2014 Politically Nomadic Cat (@KittehDark) September 5, 2019\n\nNot rape, just \"forced pleasurable encounters\" by future \"justice-involved persons\". These are the people that want to be in charge of our well being once they take our guns. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 You've Got to Be Kidding Me \ud83d\ude44 (@SpencerAnglin) September 4, 2019\n\nOh, sorry, we\u2019d forgotten that San Francisco is pushing to re-brand \u201cconvicted felons\u201d as \u201cjustice-involved persons\u201d and do away with negative terms like \u201coffender\u201d and \u201caddict.\u201d\n\nImagine if we lived in a free society, where EVERYONE had the right to keep and bear arms, and there were no victims left\u2026 \u2014 Little-Known Blogger (@L_K_Blogger) September 5, 2019\n\nFighting patriarchy/rape culture and learning self-defense are not mutually exclusive. \u2014 Kofoworola Oni'gba'yun. (@Blakkoffee) September 3, 2019\n\nBe realistic 4 once. Stop dreaming. Why not do both. U know it won't be beyond rape tomorrow, 5 yrs, 10yrs or 20 yrs 4rm now. Meanwhile they can be defending themselves and their friends. \u2014 Weldon (@kipweldone) September 3, 2019\n\nThis is an awful take that is in no way rooted in reality. You\u2019re actually doing a disservice by suggesting it. \u2014 DanCamm (@Dan_Camm) September 5, 2019\n\nI teach women's self defense. Your tweet is going to be a framed poster on the wall of my school. I'm also going to start classes with, \"who's ready for some dysTOPIAAAA!\" \u2014 Darrel Harb (@HARBDARREL) September 5, 2019\n\nSign us up!\n\nAnd in the meanwhile, just go ahead and be a victim though. \u2014 Breckenridge Elkins (@bjr1031) September 5, 2019\n\nHoly shit, this is at the top of the list for dumbest thing I've ever heard. \u2014 PLEB \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@HuMbLe_StOiC) September 5, 2019\n\nI agree with your statement but I disagree with not learning to protect ourselves. Until rape is dealt with which can take generations we have to take action as well. Women can also participate in their safety \u2014 Olivia Honey (@LolaHoneyBuns) September 3, 2019\n\nYou can't get more ridiculous than this. \u2014 VR Sampath (@VRSampath) September 4, 2019\n\nBlaming a woman who knows self defense or is armed for another's rape? \u2014 Rebel Rae (@RebelRae13) September 5, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair assessment. It\u2019s a bit like saying if you install a security system on your house that you\u2019re telling burglars to rob someone else. \u2014 upstartrising (@upstart_rising) September 3, 2019\n\nWhen I lock the doors to my house at night I\u2019m not actually reducing crime, i\u2019m just making them rob someone more vulnerable\u2026 \u2014 Chuck Davis (@ChuckD1791) September 5, 2019\n\nI was feeling dumb today, but then I saw your tweet, thanks \u2014 Franco (@Franco_Rocco_) September 5, 2019\n\nAre you kidding? pic.twitter.com/uJ8S8Bc5LM \u2014 Bobbi Jo Wo\u00f6ds (@beejereeno) September 5, 2019\n\nNo\u2026. What people are saying TO RAPISTS is that they should be SHOT and likely killed and that NO ONE will have sympathy for them if they meet that outcome\u2026. There is literally no message more antirape than \"you should die simply for attempting it\"\u2026 You WALNUT. \u2014 Sasha (@KittyBatSeth) September 4, 2019\n\nPs\u2026. Since that self defense training includes CONCEALED FIREARMS ownership\u2026 There is additionally NO ONE who is in any way identifiable as \"more vulnerable\" as ANYONE in public could be armed and willing to defend themselves and/or others\u2026. No \"safe place\" FOR RAPISTS. \u2014 Sasha (@KittyBatSeth) September 4, 2019\n\nAnd mic drop.\n\nRelated:", "description": "So if you learn to defend yourself against rape, you're just inviting someone else to be raped?", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tin-foil-hot-take.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
