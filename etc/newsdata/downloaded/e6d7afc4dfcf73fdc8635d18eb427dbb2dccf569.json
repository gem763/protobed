(In certain cases, this is no bad thing!)\n\nWe tested a variety of outdoor furniture pieces to see how they performed in our own backyard, keeping in mind form and functionality but above all, durability when put through their paces in the great outdoors.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The rattan weave is made from 100 per cent recycled plastic \u2013 inspiring stuff. But equally impressive is its shrewd design. The set transforms from a luxurious eight-seater into a perfectly neat cube, with four stools that tuck into its four armchairs, that in turn, tuck into the table. Stow the seating away when not in use for all-important space saving. Compact and ever so clever.\n\nBuy now\n\nTiiPii 1.8m Nester hanging daybed: \u00a3349, TiiPii\n\nLuxury lounging doesn\u2019t come much better than this: the playful hanging bed is large enough to comfortably hold three to five adults (who says kids should have all the fun?), and feels perfectly secure and durable, despite weighing in at just 7kg. We loved that it folds down into a neat carry bag, making it ideal for transporting. And we loved the social element, too. Hang it from a weight-carrying branch, or team it with its own sturdy triangular frame, and you have an idyllic relaxation spot.\n\nBuy now\n\nThornback & Peel lobster deckchair: \u00a3145, Thornback & Peel\n\nThe humble deckchair ups its game thanks to queens of quirky screen printed homewares, Juliet Thornback and Delia Peel. Far from flimsy, this proved to be a sturdy garden chair in which to relax with its solid frame crafted from sustainably sourced Merpauh hardwood, and its heavy duty cotton canvas sling that's easily removable for washing. Fans of the brand's distinctive illustrations in repeat patterns will love this funky lobster design. As an added bonus, it reminded us to slap on the factor 50, else we'd turn into one.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nHayes Garden World Cambridge bistro set: \u00a3299, Hayes Garden World\n\nMost bistro sets are either ornate metal affairs, or collapsible wooden numbers \u2013 neither of which offers much in terms of comfort. For a more luxurious option we tested this tea for two garden set, featuring cosy high-backed cushioned armchairs and a round, glass-topped table. The hand-woven grey resin weave added instant elegance to our patio space, while the table was ideal for drinks, or a light casual lunch. The extra wide arms allowed us to sit back and laze away the afternoon \u2013 precisely what was needed on a sunny Sunday.\n\nBuy now\n\nWe Love Cushions large outdoor cushion, mouths blue: \u00a399.99, We Love Cushions\n\nThis was such a hit with our little testers that we barely got a look-in, but when we did, we found it to be super soft and bouncy \u2013 ideal for frolicking around in the garden, or curling up with a good book on a warm summer\u2019s day. Covered in durable, waterproof fabric and tangibly good quality, ours withstood quite a bashing. But that\u2019s the point: this outdoor piece is designed for fun all the way. The oversized outdoor cushion would make a great pet lounger for pampered pooches enjoying the sun, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nNorden Home Briana hanging chair: \u00a382.99, Wayfair\n\nWhile the TiiPii is for sharing, this bohemian hanging chair is designed for indulgent me-time, strictly solo. Adding a laid-back Scandi feel to our garden, we hung this lightweight cotton chair from a sturdy branch, and made it even cosier with the addition of a sheepskin rug. The chair is cup-shaped to give a bit of back support, allowing us to properly recline as we were gently rocked in the summer breeze. An affordable alternative to most hanging garden chairs, and a really pretty one at that. We\u2019ll be bringing ours indoors come autumn.\n\nBuy now\n\nOut There Interiors teak garden bench: \u00a3660, Out There Interiors\n\nBlurring the boundaries between indoor and outdoor furniture, this beautiful piece from Out There Interiors is as much at home complementing the kitchen table as it is sitting pretty at the bottom of the garden. Crafted from solid teak, its smooth Nordic lines are only interrupted by the natural patina of the wood. We loved its continuous enveloping back rest and its literally laid-back, angled legs. No ordinary garden bench, this is undoubtedly the design lover\u2019s choice.\n\nBuy now\n\nNational Trust Cliveden modular sofa set E: \u00a34,199, Bridgman\n\nCliveden\u2019s outdoor furniture pieces are crafted under special licence by the National Trust \u2013 and trust us, they\u2019re top quality. High-end in price, too, but as we discovered with this sprawling outdoor lounge set, you get what you pay for, and then some. Modular pieces are linked together with stainless steel clips, while waterproof acrylic cushions and tables with high pressure laminate tops mean this set is reliably waterproof. Ideal for the British temperament, although you'd be forgiven for thinking you\u2019re at a five-star hotel in Bermuda.\n\nBuy now\n\nMade Yuri garden lounge chair, multi woven pink: \u00a3159, Made\n\nMade\u2019s outdoor furniture collection continues to inspire, bringing bold design into the realms of the tantalisingly accessible. This mid-century inspired lounge chair is just one example of its wholly covetable garden-ready range. We loved its inviting form: low, angled legs and a semi-conical body make it an ideal patio piece, adding a daring dash of colour to the traditional rattan. You\u2019ll want to leave this beauty out year-round, which, incidentally, you can.\n\nBuy now\n\nDanetti Porto grey round 4 to 6 seater dining table: \u00a3379, Danetti\n\nThis contemporary garden table looks great whether teamed with similarly designled dining chairs in a contrasting colour, or centred within a curved outdoor sofa unit for the ultimate in alfresco comfort. Designed by Danetti\u2019s creative in-house team, its geometric base is crafted from powder-coated aluminium tubing, making it surprisingly lightweight and easy to transport. Cleverly, the table top is finished in frosted glass to prevent any reflections and glare from the sun. We wouldn\u2019t want anything to spoil our patio lunch.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Garden furniture\n\nEnvirobuild\u2019s Forrester cube is a design triumph. When opened out it becomes a luxurious dining set for eight, allowing family and friends to spread out in style. Yet when folded in it makes for a striking and compact patio piece. Where it earns our further admiration is its impressive eco credentials. Guests won\u2019t know they\u2019re relaxing in 100 per cent recycled plastic, but how\u2019s that for an alfresco dinner party conversation starter? Top marks for sustainability.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
