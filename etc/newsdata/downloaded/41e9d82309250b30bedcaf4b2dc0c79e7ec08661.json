She just has to gracefully defy gravity first to get the crowd pumped up.

Getty Images\n\n\u201cGymnastics is the only sport I\u2019ve ever done, so when it comes to anything else, I\u2019m literally terrified,\u201d she said before the pitch, according to NBC Sports. \u201cSo I get more nervous doing this stuff than competing, which is really weird. So, yeah, hopefully I don\u2019t end up on celebrity fails.\u201d\n\nBiles asked for a pen for an autograph from Marisnick after the pitch, with many watching rightfully thinking that it was actually Marisnick asking for an autograph from her.\n\nAs a bonus, everyone was treated to one of the internet's favorite sight gags: Simone Biles with a much taller person.\n\nBiles gives a high-five to Houston Astros center fielder Jake Marisnick after her first pitch. Troy Taormina / Reuters\n\nWhile it wasn't quite like when the 4-foot-8-inch dynamo met 7-foot-2-inch Shaquille O'Neal, Biles had to go way up high to slap five with the 6-foot-4-inch Marisnick after her pitch.\n\nNow that she has conquered the first pitch, the four-time gold medalist has her sights set on the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nHopefully she returns with another haul of gold medals, and then we can see her back on her favorite apparatus \u2014 the pitcher's mound.", "description": "Simone Biles put her own signature on a ceremonial first pitch before the Houston Astros' World Series game with a twisting backflip.", "authors": ["Scott Stump"], "top_image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_43/1498139/simone-biles-astros-pitch-flip-today-main-191024_2_25328ae19979cc0f9a4cd839b112b31f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
