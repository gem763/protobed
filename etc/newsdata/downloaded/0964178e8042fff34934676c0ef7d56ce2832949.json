In a blog post accompanying the on-stage announcement, Google further clarified that the service would go live at 9am PST (12pm EST, 5pm BST) on that day.\n\nAs previously discussed , the only players that will be able to access Stadia on that launch day are those who spend $129 to purchase the Stadia Founder's Edition package (or the substantially similar Premiere Edition that was announced later). Those packages comes with a Wi-Fi Stadia Controller, a Chromecast Ultra for TV streaming, three months of Stadia Pro, and a streamable copy of Destiny 2.\n\nAfter that first three months, Stadia Pro will cost $10 a month on top of any individual game purchases. For that price, users get access to one free game per month and the highest tier of 4K resolution streaming quality.\n\n[/ars_video\n\nIf you're still confused, Google also has a new \"How It Works\" video explaining that Stadia is \"kind of like streaming music or TV shows, with high quality video games.\" That video also clarifies that mobile access at launch will be limited to the Pixel 3 and 3a family of phones and Chrome OS tablets (including Pixel Slate, Acer Chromebook Tab 10, and HP Chromebook X2). At launch, the Google Stadia controller will only work wirelessly when playing via Chromecast Ultra on a TV (the controller can be connected to a phone or computer via USB cable as well).\n\nAt the Made with Google event, chief Rick Osterloh sold Stadia as part of Google's \"ambient computing vision,\" which promises that \"throughout your home, technology works as a single system, rather than a bunch of devices doing one thing.\" To that end, Osterloh says Stadia is \"aiming to deliver the best games ever made to just about any screen in your life.\"\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated with more information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListing image by Google", "description": "Screen-agnostic streaming gaming sold as part of Google's \"ambient computing vision.\"", "authors": ["Kyle Orland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/stadia-controller-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
