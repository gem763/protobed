But as kids head back to school, the quest to come up with snacks that won't give them a sugar rush in the middle of math class or sit uneaten in their lunchbox until the end of the day gets kicked into high gear. Luckily, we've got a few kid-approved recipes and thought starters in our back pocket, so crossing this item off your long weekend to-do list just got a whole lot simpler.\n\nBelow you'll find a collection of goodies that make use of natural sweeteners and are high in fibre and healthy fats, but still look and taste enough like dessert that your kiddos will be none the wiser. Oh, and many of them are freezer-friendly too, so you can make big batches and freeze in individual servings to reach for on especially hectic mornings. How's that for a success story to start off the school year?\n\nGranola Cluster Trail Mix\n\nLemon & Berry Chia Yogurt\n\nJoy McCarthy's Chocolate Chip Banana Muffins\n\nShamrock Breakfast Shake\n\n(Photo: David Bagosy; Styling: Melissa Direnzo)\n\nShahir's Power Balls\n\nFruit Salad Parfaits\n\nCarrot Cake Trail Mix\n\n(Photo: David Bagosy, Styling: Melissa Direnzo)\n\nGreen Tea Muffins with Sweet Azuki Beans\n\nJoy McCarthy's Chocolate Chia Mousse\n\nBlack Seed Smoothie\n\nChocolate Blueberry Loaf Cake\n\nPB&J Thumbprint Breakfast Cookies", "description": "Sweet snackables you won\u2019t feel guilty about serving them.", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4982901.1567112817!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/carrot-cake-trail-mix.jpg"}
