And despite further falls in recent days, Brent crude oil prices are still nearly 10 percent higher than they were at the start of 2019.\n\nOn Friday, China's Premier Li Keqiang held a special meeting with top energy officials stressing the need to maintain energy security amid rising global tensions and the country's supply challenges.\n\nLi said China needed to further tap its own coal resources, boost domestic gas and oil exploration, and push for more hydropower, wind and solar energy to diversify its energy sources.\n\nHere comes the sun\n\nAll of those options come with pros and cons. But in the long term, analysts say, China appears to have little choice but to give renewables a major boost.\n\nWhile domestically produced coal gives China a valuable energy security buffer, over-reliance on it has in recent years resulted in choking smog in some of its biggest cities. Oil and gas, whether imported or domestically sourced, also contribute to pollution.\n\nMeanwhile, imported oil and gas, as witnessed by recent events, expose China to overseas developments over which Beijing has little control.\n\nNuclear power generates large amounts of toxic waste that can take hundreds of years to degrade, while hydroelectric projects displace entire communities and ecosystems.\n\nOil giant BP said China accounted for 24 percent of the world's energy consumption last year, the biggest share of any country.\n\nAs of 2017, most of that energy, around 60 percent, came from coal. Oil contributed another 19 percent, and gas another seven percent. Renewables accounted for around three percent, according to BP.\n\nThat picture is set to change.\n\nChina is stepping up its push into renewable energy [File: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg]\n\nBP's projections show renewables rising in importance, supplying 18 percent of China's energy by 2040, the same proportion as oil by then. The proportion of gas will likely double from seven percent in 2017 to 14 percent by 2040. Meanwhile, coal's share will fall to 35 percent.\n\nWhile the Middle Kingdom has been a leader in installing solar and wind power in recent years, new policies removing subsidies for renewable projects have started to slow the implementation of such projects.\n\nEven with all the recent installations, wind and solar only accounted for 5.2 percent and 2.5 percent respectively of China's national power generation in 2018, according to data from the China National Energy Administration. So there is substantial room for growth in renewable energy, analysts say.\n\n\"Globally, everyone is looking at higher oil prices and a higher energy bill,\" James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, told Al Jazeera. \"To what degree that propels China to look at other alternatives, more renewables, more gas, theoretically this could be an incentive.\"\n\nOil dependent\n\nBut right now, imported oil remains crucially important for China's economy.\n\nAccording to Yujiao Lei, a consultant at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, Saudi Arabia accounts for more than 15 percent of China's crude imports. And Chinese customs data show that Saudi Arabia is the largest single source of China's crude oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia had stepped up its exports to China in recent months to fill a gap left by Iran. In May, the US said it would not renew waivers issued to several countries, including China, that allowed them to continue importing Iranian oil while under US sanctions.\n\nGeopolitical uncertainty and the possibility of further strikes, or retaliation against Iran - which China has also been wooing for energy supplies despite US sanctions - could keep prices elevated, further disrupting China's supplies, analysts say.\n\nAttacks on Saudi Aramco's oil processing facilities in Buqayq, Saudi Arabia on September 14 resulted in the biggest one-day gains for crude prices on record. [September 14: Reuters]\n\nChina's state-run media coverage has largely attempted to downplay the attacks' impact on China, with the Global Times newspaper reporting on September 17 that China could tap into its 90-day strategic oil reserve to stabilise prices in the near term.\n\n\"The possibility of a more substantial future disruption has to be a concern for Beijing,\" Jonathan Fulton, a political scientist in the Gulf region told Al Jazeera.\n\nDorsey said the attacks highlighted the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia's oil assets. He added that those concerns would remain as long as it continued to wage war in Yemen, also leaving China vulnerable to associated risks.\n\n\"More fundamentally, there are voices that are suggesting China may have to further diversify their sources of fossil fuels,\" Dorsey said. \"The problem is where do you go?\" he asked.\n\nThe gas solution\n\nThe natural gas market could give China more options for sourcing energy from more stable parts of the world.\n\nChina has already announced plans to increase natural gas usage by 60 percent by 2023,\n\n\"In some ways, the US would be a logical asset, but with the trade war and the decoupling of the economies, diversification would be easier said than done,\" Dorsey said.\n\nThe US is set to become a net exporter of oil and gas by next year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nA China-US trade deal, which could bolster US President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election ambitions, could also be an avenue for China to ease its energy supply constraints.\n\nBut the interim trade deal struck between the US and China on Friday does not appear to contain any agreements on boosting natural gas imports to China, and full details of the agreement are not expected to be finalised by mid-November when the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit takes place in Chile.\n\n\"American liquefied natural gas exporters have been especially hurt by the trade war - China is the second-largest importer of LNG and that's been set to increase as it tries to move away from coal-fired power plants,\" Fulton said.\n\nA solution to China's problem may lie much closer to home.\n\nConsultancy firm McKinsey says that around 70 percent of the world's new LNG production capacity over the next three years will be in the US and Australia, putting the latter in a strong position to benefit from the growing demand in China.\n\nIn fact, China's growth in demand for LNG is already mostly being served by Australia, according to McKinsey.\n\nAnother potential source of abundant natural gas for China is Russia, a close political ally.\n\nThe Chinese Premier Li was in Russia on September 18, four days after the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, talking about energy infrastructure and other deals with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nGas imports from Qatar are also likely to increase, according to Fulton.", "description": "Instability in the Middle East may be forcing China to rethink its energy supply mix.", "authors": ["Michael Standaert", "About The Author", "Michael Standaert Is A Journalist", "Writer Based In Shenzhen."], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/e467f186d947485ca87ed6ab4a0afa6f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
