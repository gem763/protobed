He came back and played a couple of games, maybe played through the pain barrier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He had a scan after the Arsenal game and maybe needed a few weeks\u2019 rest in a boot so hopefully he won\u2019t be too long, but he won\u2019t make this game, no.\u2019\n\nDe Gea, meanwhile, suffered a groin injury during the second half of Spain\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier draw against Sweden and had to be replaced by Chelsea\u2019s Kepa Arrizabalaga.\n\nOn United\u2019s No.1, Solskjaer added: \u2018David needs a scan. I think he\u2019ll be out. It certainly looked like it anyway judging on last night so it\u2019s just one of those things.\u2019\n\nDavid De Gea limped off during Spain\u2019s 1-1 draw against Sweden on Tuesday (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe injuries have come at the worst possible time for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as he already has a depleted squad to pick from ahead of the game at Old Trafford.\n\nSolskjaer is without Jesse Lingard, Eric Bailly, Phil Jones and Diogo Dalot while Luke Shaw and Mason Greenwood are currently rated as doubtful to play a part.\n\nIn more encouraging news for United, Anthony Martial could be in line for a return after coming through a training session unscathed on Tuesday following two months out with a thigh strain.\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka and Victor Lindelof are also expected to be involved having missed the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United with tonsilitis and a back problem respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t tell you 100 per cent [who] is going to be fit as something might happen,\u2019 Solskjaer added. \u2018But hopefully, Aaron and Anthony will last the training this week and be available for selection. If it\u2019s for half a game or 30 minutes I don\u2019t know but let\u2019s see where they\u2019re at.\u2019\n\nSergio Romero is in line to replace De Gea at Old Trafford on Saturday.", "description": "Manchester United have suffered a double blow ahead of Sunday's meeting with Liverpool with both Paul Pogba and David De Gea set to miss out through injury.
