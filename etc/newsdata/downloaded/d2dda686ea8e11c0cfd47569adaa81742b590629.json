Over to you Tom!'\n\nHe needs to hip STOP! The Today show's Tom Steinfort (pictured) awkwardly rapped out of time to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song on Thursday\n\n'Could've picked it up from where you left it. Makes no- cooling, shooting some b-ball outside of the school,' Tom began, struggling to remember the words.\n\nRather than rapping, the newsreader then rushed through the rest of the song without a trace of rhythm.\n\n'Couple of guys were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighbourhood, got in one little fight and mum got scared and I'm moving auntie and uncle in Bel-Air,' Tom quickly mumbled.\n\nCringe! Tom rushed through the rap, mumbling and forgetting the lyrics along the way. Allison Langdon (left), Georgie Gardner (centre) and Brooke (centre, right) were impressed\n\nEveryone's a critic! 'The delivery could have had a little bit more impact,' weatherman Steven Jacobs (pictured) said\n\nSurprisingly, Brooke, Georgie Gardner and Allison Langdon were impressed by Tom's rapping skills and clapped while weatherman Steven Jacobs looked shocked.\n\n'The delivery could have had a little bit more impact,' Steven critiqued.\n\nKeen to redeem himself, Tom attempted the song a second time, this time slowing it down with backing vocals from Allison.\n\nWhat would Will Smith think? Tom's rap came after a segment on the Hollywood star's new Bel-Air clothing line. Pictured: Will Smith on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n\nNot again! Keen to redeem himself, Tom attempted the song a second time, this time slowing it down with backing vocals from Allison\n\nThe segment was used to fill time as they closed out the show and crossed to Today Extra.\n\nSonia Kruger said the performance was 'amazing', prompting Richard Wilkins to sarcastically ask: 'What sort of amazing?'\n\n'For a second I thought Tom was speaking in tongues!'
