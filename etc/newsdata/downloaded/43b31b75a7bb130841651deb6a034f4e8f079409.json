Those earning $48,000 to $90,000 will see their tax cuts double from $530 to $1,080. Part-time workers earning less than $37,000 a year are getting a smaller tax cut of $255, or just $4.90 a week. Stage one increases the threshold for the 32.5 per cent personal income tax bracket from $87,000 to $90,000, over four years until 2022 Stage two, from July 1, 2022, will increase the 19 per cent personal income tax bracket from $41,000 to $45,000. It also raises the 32.5 per cent personal income tax bracket from $90,000 to $120,000 Stage three will see the 37 per cent tax bracket abolished from July 1, 2024 and a new 30 per cent tax bracket created for all individuals earning between $45,001 and $200,000. The number of tax brackets will be slashed from five to four for the first time since 1984\n\nAfter several months, this adds up to a maximum of $1,050, or five penalty units.\n\nMr Chapman said someone who registered with a tax agent would avoid incurring that fine, and also have until May 2020 to lodge their return through an accountant.\n\n'If they registered with a tax agent then nothing will happen,' he said.\n\n'If you're a self lodger, and you've not lodged by the 31st of October, you're going to be late and you're looking at a late lodgement penalty.'\n\nSince early July, more than 8.1million taxpayers have lodged a return.\n\nThat leaves another five million Australians who are yet to declare their expenses for the year.\n\n'The balance of those people will be one who will lodge between now and the 31st of October, and there will also be tax agent clients who don't have to lodge until May next year,' Mr Chapman said.\n\nIn the April budget, Treasurer Josh Frybenberg unveiled $158billion worth of tax cuts for 10million Australian workers.\n\nThose on salaries of $48,000 to $90,000 are entitled to the full $1,080 in tax relief.\n\nThose earning between the tax-free threshold of $18,200 and $37,000 a year are receiving up to $255.\n\nTax relief is also going to those earning up to $126,000 a year.", "description": "Australians who fail to lodge their tax return by October 31 face being fined up to $1,050.
