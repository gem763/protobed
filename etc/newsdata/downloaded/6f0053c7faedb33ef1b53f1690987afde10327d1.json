Amazon is publicly launching its Alexa Answers program, a way for the company to crowdsource answers for questions Alexa doesn\u2019t have a response for.\n\nAlexa Answers was initially introduced in December to a small invite-only beta group. The difference is now literally anyone can contribute answers.\n\nEditor's Note: It's currently unclear whether this functionality will be live in Australia.\n\nMe, you, your neighbour Gary. Anyone. If you opt into the program, you\u2019ll be asked to browse questions that \u201cmatch your interest or expertise.\u201d From there, you can provide an answer that Alexa will then share, citing the source as \u201caccording to an Amazon customer.\u201d\n\nAmazon is also gamifying the process. Those who participate will also get a dashboard with access to stats, such as how many answers they\u2019ve contributed, how their answers were rated, and how many times their answers have been shared by Alexa.\n\nHere\u2019s some examples of questions stumping Alexa:\n\nHow many birds migrate?\n\nWhat is Juniper syrup?\n\nWhere is the most snowfall?\n\nWhere was the world\u2019s largest wave surfed?\n\nHow long does it take for an ice cube tray to freeze?\n\nWhat states surround Illinois?\n\nWhat\u2019s the proper amount of sleep?\n\nHow many instruments does Stevie Wonder play?\n\nHow much is in a handle of alcohol?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that anyone actually knows the answer to most of these questions off the top of their head. Chances are participants are just going to google the answer before punching it in. And according to a Fast Company report, Amazon isn\u2019t requiring citations for the source people use to find their answers.\n\nSo, on the one hand, this is probably a crowdsourced workaround for Amazon which doesn\u2019t have the massive search engine capabilities of say, Google Assistant. On the other hand, there\u2019s no stopping potential trolls from trying to spam the program with joke answers. Aside from the dubious call of leadership board glory, what other incentive do people have to do Amazon\u2019s work for free than the opportunity to introduce chaos?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaning into the positive energy and good faith of the contributors, and we use machine learning and algorithms to weed out the noisy few, the bad few. But we\u2019re not going to suppress the magical experience we can give to 99 customers because one person had something different in mind,\u201d Bill Barton, Amazon\u2019s vice president of Alexa information, told Fast Company.\n\nUm, ok. Sure. Because algorithms have never failed. In any case, the next time Alexa answers your question \u201caccording to an Amazon customer,\u201d maybe just look it up on your phone instead.\n\n[Fast Company]", "description": "The next time you ask Alexa a question, the answer could come from some rando with an internet connection.
