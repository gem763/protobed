The court heard that the pair had been taking turns driving so they could avoid becoming overtired on the drive home.\n\nThe car was seen veering across the motorway before it hit a lorry. None of the others in the car suffered serious injury.\n\nMiss Gill died from the injuries sustained in the crash four days later in Derriford Hospital. Mr Evans and his sons Isaac, three, and Arthur, one both survived unharmed.\n\nEvans, 21, of Whitchurch, Devon, today admitted causing death by careless driving when he appeared at Exeter Crown Court.\n\nHe denied the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nJudge Timothy Rose adjourned that case for a trial next June but urged the prosecution to review the case and decide whether they will accept the lesser charge.\n\nDominic and Kayleigh had been returning from a family holiday to Egypt with their sons Isaac, three, (left) and Arthur, one, (right). Both children were thankfully left unharmed\n\nDominic and Kayleigh were engaged to be married and had planned for the ceremony to go ahead in 2020\n\nMr Evans was released on bail at Exeter Crown Court today and has been banned from driving\n\nHe said: 'This case goes back to January and it might be thought to be in the interest of everybody that it is brought to a relatively speedy conclusion.\n\n'In the light of all the considerations, the sentencing powers for the lesser offence are more than adequate.'\n\nMr Peter Coombe, defending, was surprised at the prosecutions pursuit of a death by dangerous driving charge, he said: 'I am surprised the prosecution have reached the decision, given that they had been in a relationship since they were 15, were engaged to be married, and had two children together.'\n\nThe judge released Evans on bail and imposed an interim driving ban. He set a provisional trial date of June 23 next year.\n\nKayleigh was a former Tavistock College student, whose family paid tribute to her after her death.\n\nHer father Steve said: 'Kayleigh was our first daughter and we couldn't have asked for a better daughter.\n\n'She has left a huge hole in our hearts and will be sorely missed by the whole family. Her little sister Rosie misses her deeply.'", "description": "Dominic Evans, 21, of Devon has admitted to causing the death of his fiance Rayleigh Gill, 22, due to careless driving as they drove back from Gatwick airport after a family holiday to Egypt.", "authors": ["John Bennett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/14/19298210-0-image-a-49_1570196066348.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
