It could be from people who have invested billions in shorting the pound, shorting the country, in expectation of a no-deal Brexit. We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nMs Phillips told the House of Commons that Mr Johnson\u2019s confrontational approach was effective.\n\n\u201cThe use of language yesterday and over the past few weeks such as the surrender bill, such as invoking the war, such as betrayal and treachery, it has clearly been tested, and work-shopped and worked up and entirely designed to inflame hatred and division,\u201d said the Birmingham Yardley MP.\n\n\u201cI get it, it works, it is working.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cIt is not sincere, it is totally planned, it is completely and utterly a strategy designed by somebody to harm and cause hatred in our country.\u201d\n\nBut a senior government source denied that Mr Johnson was deliberately trying to stoke division.\n\n\u201cA lot of people here don\u2019t want to face the fundamentals of their environment,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cTemperatures are getting particularly extreme now because we are trying to make everyone face reality.\n\n\u201cIf you have spent three years trying to avoid facing reality and then you have got to face reality, it is inevitably rather an uncomfortable process.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s sister Rachel has branded his comments on murdered MP Jo Cox \u201chighly reprehensible\u201d and tasteless.
