In January, WeWork announced that it would change its name to the We Company to reflect the fact that its ambitions had grown from office-sharing to every facet of the collective human experience. Under this new umbrella company, the firm would revolutionize living space (WeLive), school (WeGrow), and retail (WeMRKT).\n\nBut the name We Company had already been trademarked\u2014by Neumann. And Neumann insisted that his company pay him $6 million for the privilege of using it.\n\nEven though Neumann was eventually goaded into giving back the fee, this gambit was ludicrous, audacious\u2014and telling. Corporate renaming falls squarely in the job description of the founder and chief executive. Neumann easily could have taken no payment at all; instead he tried to extract a $6 million bonus for less than a day\u2019s work.\n\nIt is not unusual for founders of billion-dollar enterprises to get rich. What\u2019s deeply unusual, however, is the way Neumann wrapped himself around WeWork\u2019s business to squeeze profit from its every pore, even as he proclaimed his firm\u2019s spirit of generosity.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: Curse of the cult of the founder\n\nIn 2013, Neumann tried to buy a small stake in a Chicago building that was in talks to lease space to WeWork. The board pushed back against Neumann, pointing out that it was a conflict of interest for Neumann to stand on both sides of a lease agreement. The next year, Neumann gained control of WeWork and proceeded with his plan of buying up several properties to lease back to his company for millions of dollars. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in anticipation of a public offering, WeWork announced that the company had lease agreements with four buildings in which Neumann had an ownership interest. Since 2016, WeWork has paid nearly $17 million to Neumann-owned buildings. Dick Costolo, the former CEO of Twitter, called this level of self-dealing \u201cegregious.\u201d\n\nWithin the company, there were other signs that Neumann\u2019s \u201cspirit of we\u201d rhetoric was a cover for \u201clucre for me\u201d behavior. In 2015, Neumann made tens of millions of dollars selling shares during an investment round. Soon after, the company offered to buy back ordinary employees\u2019 shares, but it offered a much lower \u201cpayout per share\u201d than what Neumann had received. Many of Neumann\u2019s kibbutzniks didn\u2019t even know they had been shafted. \u201cNeumann\u2019s sale wasn\u2019t publicized within the company,\u201d according to Wall Street Journal reports.", "description": "The disgraced founder got rich selling a shaky business as a values-driven movement.", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2RB09/facebook.jpg?1571945080", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
