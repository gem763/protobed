Justin Roiland\u2019s character broke the fourth wall to tell viewers that he would be back season four, but referencing the delay, he joked: \u2018However long it takes.\u2019\n\nTurns out, it didn\u2019t take long at all (well, two years). Footage released by Adult Swim shows the inter-dimensional being teaching a university class (in a top hat and cane no less) and having to fight off a gang of now-rabid students.\n\nMr Poopybutthole is back for season four of Rick and Morty (Picture: Adult Swim)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rest of the trailer shows Rick and Morty knee-deep in space battles, magic and all kinds of mind-bending, genre-twisting cartoon nonsense.\n\nThe fourth cycle of the show comes two years after the third, and its no coincidence that Mr Poopybutthole is glimpsed at in the new trailer; he\u2019s the character most commonly associated with the show\u2019s long hiatuses.\n\nFans of the show are already second-guessing what could happen in the next run, anticipating that Evil Morty will play a pivotal role in the proceedings.\n\nCaption: Rick and Morty season4 teasers: Evil Morty is back\n\nProviders: Adult Swim/Twitter/RickandMorty\n\nIt also appeared that, yes, we could be getting a Kanye West episode of the cult hit too, so you should probably start preparing yourself for that already.\n\nThe programme has also faced a sad turn of events in the last few weeks; one of its producers, Michael Mendel, sadly passed away at the age of 53.\n\nRick and Morty season four will air in November. UK viewers can catch the show on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
