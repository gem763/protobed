The boss sees it and in the end it is his decision who plays or not. I am a fighter.\n\n\u201cThe key point is to be patient. There are players who are patient and there are players who are not patient\u2026I am struggling. It is part of the game and you need to accept it.\n\nDejan Lovren has found starts hard to come by at Liverpool in recent times (David Davies/PA)\n\n\u201cYou are fighting with yourself and your character and it is not good to have sometimes this part of the game where you think \u2018OK, I am easy (comfortable) inside\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. It is always about fighting and the fighting spirit.\u201d\n\nLovren has come through a number of difficult spells at the club and always bounced back stronger.\n\nTottenham visit Anfield on Sunday and the Croatian could start back-to-back matches for the club for the first time in 10 months if Matip does not recover from a minor knee problem.\n\nAnd that is the reward for deciding to stay on.\n\n\u201cThe transfer window time is now over. I will always be here if I am needed,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI am giving more than 100 per cent for this club from day one. There are good days and bad days but six years is quite a long time. Everything, at the moment, is fine. Let\u2019s see what will happen.\n\n\u201cIt was a challenge for me this summer to stay here but I gave everything in pre-season and I fought.\n\n\u201d In the end I stayed and I am quite happy.\u201d\n\nLiverpool beat Tottenham in last season\u00b4s Champions League final (Mike Egerton/PA)\n\nLiverpool and Tottenham have gone on vastly different paths since Klopp\u2019s side beat the Londoners in June\u2019s Champions League final.\n\nHowever, the Reds boss will not underestimate Sunday\u2019s opponents despite them winning just three Premier League games this season.\n\n\u201cYes, you should not be surprised I see it like that. I have no idea what happens there but football is like this, from time to time things don\u2019t work out,\u201d Klopp said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like they forgot how to play football; if Harry Kane didn\u2019t know it any more he showed in the (midweek Champions League against Red Star Belgrade) game how good he could be.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is not expecting any time of it against Mauricio Pochettino\u00b4s Tottenham (Peter Byrne/PA)\n\n\u201cYou cannot understand it from outside but they are always able to put a proper performance on the pitch.\n\n\u201cWe won the Champions League final, we know that, but I think we were very respectful with the celebrations.\n\n\u201cBut that, of course, is another additional motivation (for Spurs) to put things right.\n\n\u201cThe situation around (the club) will not make a massive difference. They will not play like a team with how many points they have.\u201d", "description": "The Croatia international has struggled for first-team opportunities with the Reds in recent times.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/09/wire-20210286-1572077055-30_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
