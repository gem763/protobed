Critics contend it erodes personal freedoms, makes political opponents vulnerable to retribution and even exposes the country's citizens to snooping by the Chinese government.\n\nThe cameras, equipped with facial recognition technology, are being rolled out across hundreds of cities around the world, particularly in poorer countries with weak track records on human rights where Beijing has increased its influence through big business deals.\n\nWith the United States claiming that Chinese state authorities can get backdoor access to Huawei data, the aggressive rollout is raising concerns about the privacy of millions of people in countries with little power to stand up to China.\n\n\"The system can be used to trail political opponents, monitor regime critics at any moment, which is completely against the law,\" said Serbia's former commissioner for personal data protection, Rodoljub Sabic.\n\nIn this photo taken Sept. 25, members of a rights group paint a face with makeup to confuse the Huawei surveillance video cameras with face-recognition software in Belgrade, Serbia. (Darko Vojinovic/Associated Press)\n\nGroups opposed to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic say police are leaking video of protests to pro-government media, which publish the images, along with the identities of participants. Vucic himself has boasted the police have the capability to count \"each head\" at anti-government gatherings.\n\nDuring a recent rally, protesters climbed up a pole and covered a camera lens with duct tape scrawled with the word \"censored.\"\n\n'Complies with all applicable laws'\n\nSerbian police deny any such abuse of the Huawei system, which will eventually encompass 1,000 cameras in 800 locations throughout Belgrade. Huawei said in a statement that it \"complies with all applicable laws and regulations\" in Serbia and anywhere else it does business.\n\nWhile facial recognition technology is being adopted in many countries, spurring debate over the balance between privacy and safety, the Huawei system has gained extra attention due to accusations that Chinese laws requiring companies to assist in national intelligence work give authorities access to its data.\n\nAs a result, some countries are reconsidering using Huawei technology, particularly the superfast 5G networks that are being rolled out later this year.\n\nStill, Huawei, which denies accusations of any Chinese government control, has had no trouble finding customers eager to install its so-called Safe Cities technology, particularly among countries that China has brought closer into its diplomatic and economic orbit.\n\nA high-tech video camera hangs from a lamppost in Belgrade, Serbia, in July.

The system is used in some 230 cities, exposing tens of millions of people to its screening.\n\nIn a promotional brochure, Huawei says its video surveillance technology can scan over long distances to detect \"abnormal behaviour\" such as loitering, track the movement of cars and people, calculate crowd size and send alerts to a command centre if it detects something suspicious. Local authorities can then act upon the information they receive.\n\nIn one case advertised on its website, the company says a suspect in a hit-and-run accident in Belgrade was later discovered in China with the help of face recognition data shared by the Serbian police with their Chinese counterparts.\n\nIn view of the cybersecurity accusations levelled by the U.S. and international rights groups against Huawei, the relationship between China and countries that use the company's technology is coming under renewed scrutiny.\n\nChina's influence in Serbia, a European Union candidate that Beijing views as a gateway to the continent, has significantly expanded in recent years through Beijing's global Belt and Road investment programs.\n\nThe populist Serbian regime has been keen to develop closer ties and the country's fragile democracy allows China's economic interests to grow relatively unchecked, without raising too many questions about human rights, environmental standards or transparency.\n\nChina's state investment bank has granted billions of dollars in easy-term loans to build coal-powered plants, roads, railroads and bridges. Chinese police officers even help patrol the streets of Belgrade, a security presence officially billed as assisting the growing number of Chinese tourists who visit the city.\n\nHuawei said in a statement that it 'complies with all applicable laws and regulations' in Serbia and anywhere else it does business. (Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press)\n\nIt's a similar story in Uganda, where China has invested heavily in infrastructure like highways and a hydropower dam on the Nile.\n\nWhen longtime President Yoweri Museveni launched a $167 million Cdn project to install Huawei facial recognition systems a year ago, he said the cameras were \"eyes, ears and a nose\" to fight rampant street crime in the sprawling capital, Kampala. Opposition activists say the real goal is to deter street protesters against an increasingly unpopular government.\n\n\"The cameras are politically motivated,\" said Joel Ssenyonyi, a spokesman for the musician and activist known as Bobi Wine who has emerged as a powerful challenger to Museveni. \"They are not doing this for security. The focus for them is hunting down political opponents.\"\n\nIn neighbouring Kenya, the government has also renewed its focus on public safety after a spate of extremist attacks. It has been pushing to register people digitally, including by recording DNA, iris and facial data. To do so, it turned to China, which helped finance the installation of surveillance cameras in Kenya as far back as 2012.\n\nThe Kenyan government wants to pool into one database all the information from public and private CCTV cameras, including those with facial recognition technology, a move that activists warn would vastly expand its surveillance powers in a country that does not have comprehensive data protection laws.\n\n50 countries\n\nA growing number of countries are following China's lead in deploying artificial intelligence to track citizens, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nThe group says at least 75 countries are actively using AI tools such as facial recognition for surveillance \u2014 and Huawei has sold its systems in 50 of those countries, giving it a far wider reach than competitors such as Japan-based NEC and U.S.-based IBM.\n\n\"It's very unclear what safeguards are being put in place,\" said Steven Feldstein, a Carnegie Endowment fellow who authored a report on the issue.\n\n\"Where are images being stored? How long are they being stored for? What kind of accountability procedures will there be? What type of operations will be linked to these surveillance cameras?\"\n\nHuawei said in an emailed statement that it \"complies with all applicable laws and regulations in our countries of business. This is the most fundamental principle of our business operations. We are dedicated to bringing people better connectivity, eliminating digital gaps, and promoting the sustainable development of our societies and economies.\"\n\nA young Serbian rights group activist has her face painted to confuse the Huawei surveillance video cameras with face-recognition software installed in Belgrade, Serbia.

(Darko Vojinovic/Associated Press)\n\nIn Belgrade's bustling downtown Republic Square, high-tech video cameras are pointed in all directions from an office building as pedestrians hurry about their everyday business.\n\nWith public authorities disclosing little about how the cameras work, a rights group has set up a tent to ask pedestrians whether they know they are being watched.\n\n\"We don't want to be in some kind of Big Brother society,\" said rights activist Ivana Markulic. \"We are asking: Where are the cameras, where are they hidden, how much did we pay for them and what's going to happen with information collected after this surveillance?\"", "description": "Cameras equipped with facial recognition technology and created by Chinese telecommunications company Huawei are being rolled out across hundreds of cities around the world.
