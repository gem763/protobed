And that\u2019s not working out too well.\u201d\n\nA potential example of Trump\u2019s version of the news can be seen in a 2017 clip posted to his campaign Twitter account, in which commentator Kayleigh McEnany, now national press secretary for the president\u2019s reelection campaign, gave a rundown of the \u201cnews of the week\u201d from Trump Tower in New York, touting positive figures about the economy thanks to Trump\u2019s efforts.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks against CNN on Thursday sparked cheers and applause from the audience. \u201cSome idiot at CNN said you can\u2019t win without CNN,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess we showed them, I guess we showed them.\u201d\n\nCNN also received backlash earlier on Thursday from the Trump campaign when the network refused to run an ad on its platform. CNN said the 30-second video, titled \u201cBiden Corruption,\u201d contained inaccuracies about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in connection with Ukraine.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/85/d5/31051a6e4c0e88fb172c86064974/gettyimages-1178821029.jpg"}
