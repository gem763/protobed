(Uli Deck/DPA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe 27-year-old gunman accused of killing two people on Thursday outside a synagogue in eastern Germany had planned for even more carnage.\n\nAccording to an 11-page manifesto by Stephan Balliet, which appears to have been released online before the attack, Balliet\u2019s main aims were:\n\n\u201c1. Prove the viability of improvised weapons.\n\n2. Increase the morale of other suppressed Whites by spreading the combat footage.\n\n3. Kill as many anti-Whites as possible, Jews preferred.\n\nBonus: Don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\nBut in a 35-minute video of the attack that he filmed with a head-mounted camera and live-streamed online \u2014 in a move eerily similar to the mosque mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March \u2014 Balliet\u2019s deadly aims were repeatedly thwarted when he couldn\u2019t enter the synagogue and when his homemade guns repeatedly jammed and failed to fire.\n\n\u201cI have certainly managed to prove how absurd improvised weapons are,\u201d he said at one point during the live stream, as he grew increasingly frustrated with his weapons.\n\nIn another instance, his purportedly homemade shotgun repeatedly jammed in a kebab shop he stormed, though he still shot dead one man in the shop.\n\nThe gunman could have caused far more death and destruction had his improvised weapons not jammed. Nonetheless, these kinds of homemade guns \u2014 often called \u201cghost guns\u201d because they are unlicensed and nearly impossible to trace \u2014 are increasingly a factor in crime and extremist attacks worldwide, according to experts.\n\n\u201cPeople have been improvising weapons forever,\u201d said Mark A. Tallman, who teaches at Colorado State University at Pueblo\u2019s Center for the Study of Homeland Security and has written a history of ghost guns. \u201cMaking guns is relatively low technology.\u201d\n\nBut while the DIY gun-making trend was once part of an \u201cobscure gun nerd subculture and gun rights protest movement \u2026 in the last few years, we\u2019ve seen extremists gravitate toward it,\u201d Tallman said.\n\nHe said these kinds of improvised, homemade weapons are particularly \u201cappealing to criminals and extremists at the lower rungs of the ladder.\u201d Compared with larger militias or terrorist groups, these people are often more isolated and operating alone without access to logistical support and networks. They may also be looking for a discreet way to acquire weapons, rather than buying a gun at the cost of getting on authorities\u2019 radar.\n\n\u201cBut there's also certain risks, like that the gun won't work if it\u2019s not made well,\u201d Tallman added.\n\nThe Luty submachine gun Balliet referred to in the video is one of six improvised guns he listed in his manifesto as part of the plan for his attack. The manifesto was released about a week ago on the German equivalent of 4chan and analyzed by researchers at the International Center for the Study of Extremism at King\u2019s College London.\n\nThe Luty was first designed by Philip Luty, an English gun fanatic known as the \u201cHome Gunsmith,\u201d who was imprisoned for publishing instructions for making firearms from easy-to-obtain materials (he died in 2011).\n\nAlongside outfitting guns from on-the-shelf materials, 3-D printing is another increasingly talked-about way for people to create their own guns. All that\u2019s needed is a 3-D printer and a blueprint from online sites.\n\nThe 3-D guns, made primarily of plastic, aren\u2019t as durable or as powerful as those made from metal, although they can be deadly nonetheless.\n\nAll weapons used in Balliet\u2019s attack, and likely all the explosives, were home-manufactured, said a senior German official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Investigators have found a 3D-printer at the suspect\u2019s home and established that some components were likely manufactured with a 3-D printer, he said.\n\nThe attacker also appeared to have uploaded a set of materials \u2014 including raw 3-D printer designs, photos of finished products and some step-by-step instructions \u2014 on how to copy his improvised weapons, according to documents obtained by ICSR and shared with The Washington Post.\n\nBalliet could have downloaded instructions or watched videos on how to make the gun from a number of online sites hosted by gun rights activists. He also apparently built crude ammunition from lead bullets, sugar and chlorate power, among other deadly DIY designs, according to the manifesto.\n\nHomemade guns are consequently proliferating, even in countries with tough gun control laws such as Germany. These laws likely prevented Balliet from acquiring more lethal firearms \u2014 but ultimately didn\u2019t stop him from making his own.\n\nGermany has some of the world\u2019s strictest gun control laws, requiring, for example, that buyers younger than 25 pass a psychological test and owners be part of a federal gun registry.\n\nMany countries in Western Europe and Asia, as well as Australia and New Zealand, have strict gun control laws and low rates of gun violence. Switzerland has high rates of gun ownership coupled with tough regulations.\n\nStill, illegal guns remain plentiful on the black market across Europe and have been used in previous attacks, such as one in Munich in 2016 that killed nine people.\n\nFirearm deaths are particularly prevalent in Brazil, El Salvador, Honduras and other parts of the Americas where \u201ceasy access to firearms, weak regulation or poor implementation of laws designed to combat firearms violence prevail,\u201d according to New York-based Amnesty International.\n\nAnd among wealthier countries, the United States stands alone with its gun culture and a level of gun violence that Amnesty has dubbed a \u201chuman rights crisis.\u201d Nearly 40,000 people in the United States were fatally shot in 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though legal guns are often readily available, \u201cghost guns\u201d are also increasingly being used in deadly shootings and crime in the country. In California, which has among the United States\u2019 strictest gun control laws, nearly one-third of firearms seized in the state are homemade, according to an investigation by the Trace.\n\nThe apparent flaws of Balliet\u2019s improvised weapons \u201cmight deter people\u201d willing to copy his manufacturing instructions, said ICSR far-right extremism researcher Blyth Crawford. But with 3D-printing technology constantly evolving, improvised weapons may still pose a growing threat in countries with heavily restricted access to firearms.\n\nRick Noack in Berlin contributed to this report.
