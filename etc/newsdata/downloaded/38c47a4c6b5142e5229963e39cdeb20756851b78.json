Critics say he hasn\u2019t gone far enough.", "language": "en", "text": "For one night at least, on Thursday, Mattis dropped that tendency as he saturated a comedic keynote address with direct jabs at Trump, who earlier this week called his former Cabinet official \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress,\u201d Mattis said in his keynote speech at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York. \u201cSo, I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I\u2019m not just an overrated general. I\u2019m the most overrated general,\" Mattis says. \"I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly that sounds pretty good to me.\" pic.twitter.com/Hzpe5lUeje \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 18, 2019\n\nWhen Mattis stepped down, the former defense secretary, who sparred with Trump over military actions between 2016 and 2018, said the president deserved to have someone \u201cwhose views are better aligned\u201d in his Cabinet. On Sunday, Mattis offered words of caution regarding Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria during an interview on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d warning that the Islamic State would \u201cresurge\u201d without military pressure in the region.\n\nThe president did not appreciate the general airing those concerns publicly.\n\n\u201cYou know why?\u201d Trump told lawmakers Wednesday. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday evening, Mattis didn\u2019t stop at responding to the president\u2019s recent barb. He also teased Trump for dodging the draft for the Vietnam War because of the \u201cbone spurs\u201d that the president has said he had in both of his heels.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cDonald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\u201d\n\nMattis also mocked the president\u2019s love of fast food.\n\n\u201cI think the only person in the military that Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t think is overrated,\u201d the general said, \u201cis Colonel Sanders.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment about Mattis\u2019s remarks.\n\nSeveral high-profile politicians at the dinner, a charity event known for comedic roasts, saluted Mattis\u2019s flippant speech. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) tweeted a photo of himself chatting with the general after the event.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile [Trump] was having another rally, it was great to catch up with General Mattis \u2014 the Meryl Streep of Generals,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut for other observers, Mattis\u2019s zingers drew attention to the military officer\u2019s reticence to substantively criticize the president.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s speaking at a dinner meant for jokes, but this is just an absurd and undignified way for Mattis to make his first public critiques of the president,\u201d Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and executive editor of the Lawfare blog, said in a tweet Thursday. \u201cAfter indefensible silence, this will surely undercut the gravity of any future words he might have on the subject.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThomas M. Nichols, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island, said he did not think the speech was an occasion for laughter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should be chuckling at Mattis\u2019s brush off of Trump\u2019s insult,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s his facile way of dodging the reality that he knows a lot about what happened in this White House, including what are now obviously impeachable acts directly related to his time as SECDEF.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCritics contrasted Mattis\u2019s jokes with an op-ed penned by retired Navy Adm. William H. McRaven in the New York Times on Thursday, which sharply rebuked the president. Titled \u201cOur Republic Is Under Attack From the President,\u201d the Navy officer\u2019s piece slammed Trump for abandoning the Kurdish soldiers who fought in Syria as America\u2019s allies. \u201cHe is wrong,\u201d McRaven wrote.\n\nAD\n\nMattis has defended his decision to keep his personal beliefs about the Trump administration private.\n\n\u201cIf you leave an administration, you owe some silence,\u201d he told the Atlantic in an interview first published in August. \u201cWhen you leave an administration over clear policy differences, you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country. They still have the responsibility of protecting this great big experiment of ours.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe general cut ties with Trump in December 2018 over disagreements about how the U.S. should treat its foreign allies and adversaries.\n\n\u201cMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,\u201d he wrote in his resignation letter.\n\nAD\n\nSince leaving Trump\u2019s Cabinet, the former defense secretary has remained mostly mum on U.S. foreign and military policy. Even in his recently released memoir, \u201cCall Sign Chaos,\u201d the military leader refrains from discussing much of his time within the Trump administration. Mattis has hinted that one day he may speak out against Trump\u2019s policy decisions more directly, saying he does not owe the president his silence \u201cforever.\u201d\n\nSome wondered Thursday evening if his jokes were a harbinger more substantive criticisms. To laughter and applause, Mattis struck another comedic blow at the dinner, this time emphasizing his own illustrious military career.\n\n\u201cYou do have to admit,\u201d he said, \u201cbetween me and Meryl, at least we\u2019ve had some victories.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Former defense secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned from the position in December, said he was \"honored\" to be mocked by President Donald Trump as the \"most overrated general.\"", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jIprHBJkQpcr2PZmk-6MPNAMwyA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GBSIJHHRJII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
