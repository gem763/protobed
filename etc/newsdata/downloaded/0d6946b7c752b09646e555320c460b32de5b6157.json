Are they sending a message that the Nobel prize is awarded to those who support those who killed Muslims at the end of the 20th century? Is the world this unjust? Does this world hate Muslims this much?\"\n\nIn less than 24 hours, more than 20,000 people have so far signed an online petition to have Handke stripped of his prize.\n\n'Stick your corpses up your ar*e'\n\nHandke in 2006 attended the funeral of Milosevic who died while facing trial for charges of war crimes and genocide in The Hague after leading his country's forces in the 1990s war. His death came before the UN war crimes tribunal could deliver a verdict.\n\nSpeaking at the funeral in front of thousands of mourners, Handke sympathised with Milosevic, calling him \"a rather tragic man\".\n\nFourteen Serb war criminals were convicted of genocide and other crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) including former Military Commander Radislav Krstic, former President of Republika Srpska Radovan Karadzic, and Bosnian Serb Military Leader Ratko Mladic.\n\nHandke has also accused Bosniaks of staging massacres in Sarajevo, held under siege for 43 months by Serb forces from 1992-1995.\n\nAccording to an article published in The Irish Times in April 1999, when critics pointed out that the victims' corpses provide evidence of Serb war crimes, Handke replied: \"You can stick your corpses up your ar*e.\"\n\n'All sides do it'\n\nHis position regarding the war in Bosnia was that Serbs were unfairly receiving the lion's share of the blame.\n\nIn an article published for the French newspaper Liberation in 2006, Handke wrote that \"the expression concentration camps\", which were set up across Bosnia, should not be used.\n\n\"It's true: intolerable camps existed between 1992 and 1995 in the Yugoslavian republics, especially Bosnia,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But let's stop automatically connecting these camps to Bosnian Serbs. There were also Croat camps and Muslim camps and the crimes committed here and there will be judged at the tribunal in The Hague.\"\n\nRegarding the Srebrenica genocide, he wrote that one should also listen to the survivors of Muslim massacres in Serb villages around Srebrenica.\n\nBut journalist Peter Maass, who reported from war-torn Bosnia including from the concentration camps, wrote in an article on Friday that \"equating a small number of random crimes with a systemic and massive number is a transparent form of deception and deflection\".\n\nHandke fails to acknowledge that the war was started by Serbs and Milosevic in particular, Maas wrote.\n\nMaass told Al Jazeera that the \"all sides do it\" argument wasn't just a \"false argument to minimise what the Serbs did and equate it with what they accused the Muslims of doing\".\n\n\"It was an argument designed to forestall Western intervention in Bosnia, and it succeeded for several years, until in 1995 there was finally an aerial bombardment by US-led NATO forces that brought on the ... Dayton accords,\" Maass said.\n\n\"The 'all sides do it' argument isn't just a matter of falsely spreading the blame, but crucially it is designed to persuade outsiders to stay on the outside - because all sides are guilty - thereby allowing a genocide to proceed unimpeded.\n\n\"This argument was pushed most vigorously by the Serbs, but it was also accepted and repeated by key European and American figures,\" Maass said.\n\nPillar of shame\n\nMeanwhile, Handke told Serbia's state TV on Thursday that he felt Serbians' \"happiness because of the big award that I have received\", adding that they will celebrate with \"a rakija [brandy] and a glass of white wine\".\n\nHe told reporters the recognition gave him \"a strange kind of freedom\".\n\nSubasic told Al Jazeera that following the upcoming 25th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide this July, the Mothers of Srebrenica plan to set up a pillar of shame with names inscribed of all those who organised and supported the genocide as well as the rape of thousands of Bosniak women and girls.\n\nIf the Nobel committee refuses to revoke the prize, Handke's name as well as that of the committee will be inscribed along with Milosevic, Mladic, Karadzic and all the analysts and politicians who supported them, Subasic said.\n\nThey will also erect a Pillar of Honour for all those who fought against the impending genocide.\n\n\"For 24 years, we mothers have been teaching our children not to hate, not to seek revenge, for our kids to be the best students,\" Subasic said.\n\n\"How will we now explain to them why this man received the Nobel prize?\n\n\"We believe the world is very unjust towards us. Those who support and glorify criminals cannot receive the Nobel peace prize. Instead, people who spread peace, love and tolerance should be awarded,\" Subasic said.", "description": "Group comprised of relatives of thousands massacred in 1995 say prestigious prize awarded to genocide denier.", "authors": ["Mersiha Gadzo"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/f5363672200643d68d27ea5203ec4ad4_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
