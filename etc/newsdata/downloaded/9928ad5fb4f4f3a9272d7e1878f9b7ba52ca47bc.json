Barr offered a withering evisceration of anti-religious sentiment last week, defending the central role of Judeo-Christian moral standards in American democracy, accusing \u201cmilitant secularists\u201d of an assault on religion that\u2019s become as intolerant as religions they criticize.\n\n\u201cThose who defy the creed risk a figurative burning at the stake \u2014 social, educational, and professional ostracism and exclusion waged through lawsuits and savage social media campaigns,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cMilitant secularists today do not have a \u2018live and let live\u2019 spirit \u2014 they are not content to leave religious people alone to practice their faith. Instead, they seem to take a delight in compelling people to violate their conscience.\u201d\n\nMr. Barr\u2019s speech, delivered at the University of Notre Dame on Friday, is gaining traction this week as the video circulates online and defenders and detractors line up. Atheists called it unvarnished \u201cbigotry,\u201d while Mr. Barr\u2019s supporters said it was one of the most important speeches on religion by a major government official in years.\n\nThe attorney general, a Catholic himself, said the country\u2019s founders saw religious liberty as the scaffolding on which they hung the government, promoting the moral discipline that made limited government possible.\n\nMr. Barr said secularists have turned that on its head, erasing those standards and replacing them with cheap substitutions that fail the test.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that no secular creed has emerged capable of performing the role of religion,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we call \u2018values\u2019 today are really nothing more than mere sentimentality, still drawing on the vapor trails of Christianity.\u201d\n\nMr. Barr\u2019s speech was followed a day later by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who in a speech in Tennessee detailed his own efforts to live his Christian faith in public life.\n\nAtheists and secularists were outraged, saying the Trump team was embracing a dangerous \u201cChristian nationalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s flagrant promotion of Christian ideology is a gift to Christian nationalists,\u201d said Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the American Humanist Association. \u201cThis religious favoritism is the kind of abuse of their duty to represent all Americans equally that demonstrates how fundamentalism is the driving force of this administration\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nReligion\u2019s role in public life, usually part of the political background, has emerged as a surprise dividing line recently.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s Democratic primary debate was peppered with commercials from the Freedom from Religion Foundation, featuring Ron Reagan, son of the late president, proclaiming himself an \u201cunabashed atheist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m alarmed by the intrusions of religion into our secular government,\u201d he said, echoing the \u201cseparation of church and state\u201d mantra schoolchildren learn today.\n\nMr. Barr said that is actually a modern \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 distortion of history.\n\nHe said the founders, in writing the Constitution, rejected a society with a weak moral character, which would have needed an overbearing coercive government, and instead counted on a people with strong Judeo-Christian beliefs that could govern themselves without a bullying government.\n\n\u201cThis is really what was meant by \u2018self-government,\u2019\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cIn short, in the Framers\u2019 view, free government was only suitable and sustainable for a religious people \u2014 a people who recognized that there was a transcendent moral order antecedent to both the state and man-made law and who had the discipline to control themselves according to those enduring principles.\u201d\n\nMr. Barr said past eras have seen religious values tested as well, and the pendulum has always swung back. \u201cPeriods of moral entrenchment follow periods of excess,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the current assault is so ferocious that it has broken that equation, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not decay; it is organized destruction. Secularists, and their allies among the \u2018progressives,\u2019 have marshaled all the force of mass communications, popular culture, the entertainment industry, and academia in an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese instruments are used not only to affirmatively promote secular orthodoxy, but also drown out and silence opposing voices, and to attack viciously and hold up to ridicule any dissenters,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Freedom from Religion Foundation said Mr. Barr got it wrong from front to back.\n\n\u201cAt the most basic level, Barr\u2019s rant was un-American,\u201d said Andrew L. Seidel, director of strategic response at the Foundation. \u201cAmerica invented the separation of state and church. It\u2019s an American original and our unique contribution to political science.\u201d\n\nDespite his grim diagnosis, Mr. Barr\u2019s remedies were slim, though he vowed to use the Justice Department to defend religious liberty.\n\nThat includes a case the department helped argue last year, where the Supreme Court upheld a nearly century-old cross memorial on public lands in Maryland. The American Humanist Association had argued the cross was too much of an entanglement of government and religion, but the court rejected that.\n\nIn a key opinion, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said such monuments have the presumption of being legal, and tearing them down could even be seen as anti-religious.\n\nThe court is currently considering another case involving religious schools\u2019 ability to access government funds made available to other private schools.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation said that case could be the most important church-state ruling in a half-century.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
