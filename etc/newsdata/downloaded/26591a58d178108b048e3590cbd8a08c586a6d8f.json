He rejected GOP positions on trade and entitlement reform. In chief respects he abandoned the party\u2019s hawkish stance on foreign policy. On guns and health care he has taken multiple positions, sometimes in the same week.\n\nAnd\u2014how to put it delicately?\u2014Mr. Trump has introduced a new standard of presidential behavior, by turns abrasive, funny and appalling. These and related matters are far from settled in Republican circles, and it seems unwise to prevent the rank-and-file from debating them. If Mr. Trump is as popular with Republicans as the polls say, he has nothing to fear from letting voters show it in primaries.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
