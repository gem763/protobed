At this stage, Democrats do not even have 218 votes despite their 235-seat majority\u2013they are somewhere, at best for the pro-impeachment crowd, somewhere around 175 pro-impeachment votes but with growing momentum. In the Senate, there is next to zero chance that 20 Republicans would join all 47 Democrats to vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges.\n\nBut Democrats, after failing to take on major legislative issues like infrastructure, healthcare, paid family leave, or anything else for that matter, are now pushing forward with opening official impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\nVia @mikedebonis and @rachaelmbade, Pelosi is now \"discussing the creation of a select committee to conduct the possible impeachment of President Trump.\u201d https://t.co/PIxMZZeDzt \u2014 Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 24, 2019\n\nA House Democrat tells me it's \"very likely\" that Pelosi will announce a formal impeachment inquiry this afternoon and signal her own support for impeachment. \u2014 Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 24, 2019\n\nThe Democrats spent all year conducting hearings and investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, only to fail\u2013as the Special Counsel Robert Mueller probe also failed\u2013to find any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between Trump and his campaign and the Russians. Mueller\u2019s investigation and the Democrat-led investigations also failed to uncover evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump, leaving Democrats empty-handed heading into the August recess back in July.\n\nBut now, after the emergence of complaints by a supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d against Trump with regard to a conversation he had with Ukraine\u2019s newly-elected leader about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Eastern European NATO ally nation, Democrats have reinvigorated their push for impeachment. They are buoyed by a swelling of support from members in key battleground House districts and renewed energy from top Democrats in leadership, including in particular House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly told her friends that she views impeachment as inevitable now.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly what the Democrats would be impeaching Trump for. The content of the supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint about Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s new president Volodymyr Zelensky remains private, as does the transcript of the call. The president has said he is considering releasing the call transcript, but has not done so yet\u2013and he expressed concerns that releasing a call transcript could produce a chilling effect among world leaders who wish to have honest and frank conversations with the president of the United States.\n\nBut on Tuesday afternoon, after news broke that Pelosi was moving forward with impeachment, Trump announced via Twitter he has ordered the release of the call transcript in full:\n\nI am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\n\u2026.You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d technically does not qualify as a whistleblower under the federal law that provides protection to such individuals, despite the media and leftists referring to the person as such, and the person apparently did not even bear witness to the call itself. Even if Trump did what was alleged, it is unclear how that would amount to an illegal act worthy of impeachment and conviction of a U.S. president, as several Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have said.\n\nNonetheless, impeachment is less of a legal question and more of a political matter. Polling shows impeaching Trump remains very unpopular nationwide, and with 31 Democrats sitting in districts in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016\u201313 of which he won by more than six percent\u2013with even more than that filling out a broader ring of vulnerable members nearing 50, Democrats could imperil their chances of holding their majority if they go through with this process.\n\nTo hit the threshold necessary to impeach Trump\u2013218 votes\u2013Pelosi would need to force several self-portrayed \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats in these approximately 50 battleground districts to support impeachment by voting for it. That prospect, getting these Democrats who go home to the district and campaign on doing things to help their constituents\u2013to actually vote for anti-Trump craze mania has Republicans nationally salivating.\n\nPelosi has held off the left side of her conference all year on impeachment, arguing it would be a perilous political mission that would endanger Democrats and embolden Trump. But with the rise of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a New York socialist, Pelosi has allowed the growth of these rising leftist forces in her conference all year, to the point where Ocasi0-Cortez has taken the driver\u2019s seat in pushing the party\u2019s agenda, the other side of the Democrat conference be damned.\n\nOver the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez ripped Democrats for holding back on impeachment\u2013ginning up the left side of the conference, firing up the Democrat base, and forcing Pelosi into action:\n\nAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2013 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019\n\nIt is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It\u2019s another to let him. The integrity of our democracy isn\u2019t threatened when a president breaks the law. It\u2018s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP\u2019s silence & refusal to act shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Ours is. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019\n\nNow that Pelosi has jumped at the behest of the 29-year-old socialist freshman from New York and her fellow \u201cSquad\u201d members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ocasio-Cortez is ripping Pelosi for only doing a committee\u2013saying she wants instead a straight-up impeachment vote.\n\nYes, this is an emergency. We don\u2019t have the luxury of time w/ another committee. Judiciary has been investigating& putting the pieces together for months. Impeachment belongs there. We must honor jurisdiction, historical precedent,& work done + allow Judiciary to move forward. https://t.co/CM0gXN7T1i \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 24, 2019\n\nThe complexity of how to structure impeachment proceedings is meaningless in the broader scheme of things politically, Republicans argue, because now in the GOP\u2019s view the Democrat Party\u2013and all of its members\u2013have officially jumped the shark by going for broke on Trump impeachment, facts be damned.\n\nTwo supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d New York Democrats who joined the impeachment brigade this week, Reps. Antonio Delgado (D-NY) and Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), are already under fire back home in their district as Empire State Republicans hammer away at them for siding with the lunacy of Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nNew York GOP chairman Nick Langworthy said in a statement:\n\nBy joining the impeachment mob, Antonio Delgado and Sean Patrick Maloney just abandoned their constituents in favor of AOC and the Squad. The radical left\u2019s endless obsession with trying to take out President Trump and derail his agenda will be rejected by the voters who want their representatives to focus on making their lives better, not their own power. This reckless decision will rightfully go down as the one that cost them their seats.\n\nThey are hardly alone. Two Virginia Democrat freshman women, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Elaine Luria (D-VA)\u2013both freshman Democrats representing battleground House districts who co-signed an op-ed with five others nationwide in the Washington Post on Monday evening signaling their openness to impeaching Trump\u2013are under fire in Virginia now for abandoning their constituents in favor of impeachment.\n\n\u201cBoth Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger were already critically endangered heading into 2020, by publicly joining the left-wing impeachment jihad they are clearly angling for post-Elected office job opportunities,\u201d John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. \u201cThe Republican Party of Virginia already has field staff on the ground this year in preparation for 2020 and will only be expanding our presence as next November approaches.\u201d\n\nAnother co-signer of their op-ed, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA)\u2013a freshman Democrat who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s sixth congressional district, another battleground\u2013is facing criticism already for siding with the radical efforts to impeach Trump while not delivering on substantive policy matters.\n\n\u201cRepresentative Chrissy Houlahan has gone Washington as she continues to prove that she cares more about partisan politics than finding solutions to the challenges we face here in Pennsylvania,\u201d John Emmons, a conservative businessman running for the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania\u2019s sixth district for the shot to take on Houlahan next November, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019d rather go after the President and try to get onto CNN than get to work for the people of her district. The voters of PA-06 deserve so much better out of their Member of Congress.\u201d\n\nRep. Jason Crow (D-CO), a freshman who co-signed the op-ed and represents a battleground district in Colorado after defeating a GOP incumbent in 2018, took a hit in Colorado for signing onto impeachment.\n\n\u201cFrom his call for impeachment to his extreme voting record, Jason Crow has put his constituents on the backburner and placed his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of working people,\u201d Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli told Breitbart News. \u201cColorado\u2019s 6th district won\u2019t forget how Crow sided with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi over them.\u201d\n\nIn Michigan, one of the op-ed\u2019s cosigners, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and another fellow freshman Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), joined the impeachment charade this week as well\u2013and also are paying for it.\n\nMichigan GOP chairwoman Laura Cox said in a statement:\n\nToday, Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens decided to join with Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the most radical members of their party by jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. For nearly three years, Democrats and their allies in the media have conducted a witch-hunt against President Trump in an attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election. Time and time again their accusations have been proven false, and I find it shameful that Slotkin and Stevens have chosen to put their political ambitions ahead of the real issues facing their constituents.\n\nThese are just a taste of the lines of attack Republicans have ready for the Democrats if they continue wallowing deeper into this mess. The extent to which the impeachment fight, along with other national trends heading into next year\u2019s presidential and congressional elections, could affect the outcome of the 2020 elections could be monstrous.\n\n\u201cBy pushing for impeachment, Democrats and their allies in the media are making a major strategic mistake,\u201d Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and former White House official who advises the president\u2019s son Donald Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. \u201cThey\u2019re literally walking directly into a buzz saw and don\u2019t even seem to realize it.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, while they draw attention to the Biden-Ukraine corruption questions, Biden continues slipping in the polls in the Democrat primary. Biden\u2019s team has attempted to frame this battle as a sign that Trump is worried about facing the former Vice President head-to-head, while avoiding answering questions about what he did as Vice President in Ukraine in connection with getting a prosecutor investigating a company on whose board his son served fired in exchange for releasing U.S. taxpayer-funded aid and then bragging about it at a public event.\n\nBut in reality, the intense scrutiny is waking the country\u2013including many Democrat voters who may not have known much about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealing in Ukraine or in China or elsewhere and how much of a liability they could be to his father politically.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)\u2013a leftist socialist rising star on the hard edge of her party far outside the mainstream\u2013has surged past Biden in polling in several states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and California. She is virtually or statistically tied with Biden in a number of national polls as well and has seen her numbers increase even in Biden strongholds like Nevada\u2013leaving South Carolina as basically the only early state refuge for the one-time Democrat frontrunner.\n\nIf Warren is able to sustain this surge into winning the nomination, while Biden keeps slipping and falling away\u2013all while Trump powers his way through this mess as he has done several times before with other Democrat-driven scandals\u2013the 2020 election could end up becoming a Warren-versus-Trump referendum of socialism-versus-capitalism where the Democrat Party\u2019s new extremist wing takes center stage with no accomplishments to point to since they won the House majority back\u2013all part of why they are going for impeachment in the first place, because they have no other path to beat Trump, some Republicans argue, so they are going for broke with this strategy.\n\n\u201cDespite an all-out assault on President Trump, he still has a higher approval rating than Obama did at this point in time,\u201d Steve Guest of the Republican National Committee said. \u201cThis round of baseless calls for impeachment is the Democrats\u2019 acknowledgment of their inability to beat President Trump at the ballot box so they\u2019ll try impeachment instead.\u201d", "description": "Democrats, failing to take on major legislative issues, are now pushing forward with opening official impeachment proceedings against Trump.", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Trump-Portrait-Resolute-Desk-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
