Arrogant Old Etonian Cameron called the referendum to sort out the internal party politics of the Conservative Party. He didn\u2019t take it seriously, he didn\u2019t put in place basic checks and balances, such as defining what \u201cLeave\u201d meant or ensuring a viable majority had to vote for such an overwhelming change to our economic and social landscape.\n\nThe narrow victory for an undefined Leave was followed by Theresa May choosing to pander to her right rather than bringing the country together. As a result, the country is more deeply and passionately divided on Brexit than on any issue since the reformation \u2013 when people felt their very souls were at stake.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJohnson\u2019s attempt to prorogue parliament is an acknowledgement of that \u2013 an avowal that he and his Brexiteer A team cannot win the argument on Brexit. They cannot win the argument in parliament so they have to close it down. They cannot win the argument in the country so they won\u2019t give the people a Final Say. They cannot win the argument politically so they won\u2019t hold a general election. All they can do is change the facts on the parliamentary ground, reduce sitting days, introduce a Queen\u2019s Speech, and keep MPs from carrying out our constitutional duty, because once they have got across the 31 October deadline, opposition to their Brexit becomes obsolete.\n\nThe northeast\u2019s economy is integrated with that of our European partners. A no-deal Brexit will be devastating for us. I know therefore that I have to use the brief time available to me in parliament to do everything I can to prevent a no-deal Brexit. People across the country have demonstrated their opposition to Johnson\u2019s smash-and-grab on democracy and Jeremy Corbyn is bringing together members of parliament from all sides to oppose the coup and stop a no-deal Brexit.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Brexit has paralysed our nation\u2019s political life; we have been governed by successive, increasingly isolated Tory governments, each pursuing to some degree a policy \u2013 austerity \u2013 that has been definitively rejected by the British people.\n\nClimate change, social care, economic equality \u2013 we have big, big issues to deal with. Every day, fires burn more of our natural carbon storage \u2013 the rainforests \u2013 but our international attention is on pursuing replacement trade deals, not combatting climate change.\n\nEvery day, I hear from constituents, friends and families faced with heartbreaking and unbearable decisions to provide social care for loved ones \u2013 but our health service is having to concentrate on stockpiling medicines, not social care.\n\nEvery day, the gap between rich and poor grows, with starting salaries for graduate lawyers up to \u00a3150k while others queue for food banks, and yet the focus of our economic policies is on reorganising our supply changes and research and development networks away from the EU. Our country and the planet cannot afford to allow this to continue. We need to resolve Brexit in a way that makes sense for Britain, and then move on to rebuild our country to meet a shared vision of our future. We need a government that is actually chosen by the British people, with a programme British people have debated and a majority have actually decided is what they want.\n\nLabour has a plan for rebuilding our economy and making it net zero, for investing in our NHS, our police, our transport system, and our regional and national cohesion \u2013 and that works for us all.\n\nBut if we don\u2019t resolve what we are going to do as a country about Brexit, the next election will not be about any of the grand challenges we face, it will be about Brexit, and will be dominated by voices and parties that either have no real agenda for our nation\u2019s future, or are hiding their true agenda behind a singular focus on Brexit.\n\nWe need a general election desperately. But the path to that election may still have to pass by another referendum so our political well is no longer poisoned by Brexit.\n\nChi Onwurah is the Labour MP for Newcastle Upon Tyne Central", "description": "As a child my favourite pantomime was the local legend of the Lambton Worm, in which an arrogant aristocrat throws an underweight fishing catch down a well and comes back years later to find it has become a giant worm holding the entire region captive.", "authors": ["Chi Onwurah"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/31/12/brexit-protests-1.jpg"}
