It marks the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer\u2019s full exit from the handgun business, with the chief noting that the big-box chain\u2019s market share of ammunition would effectively be reduced from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been listening to a lot of people inside and outside our company as we think about the role we can play in helping to make the country safer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIt was a bold move for Walmart \u2014 the chain has stores that are prevalent in largely non-urban and politically right-leaning regions of the country. But according to a data study by CivicScience, the decision to nix firearms from its inventory might ultimately pay off for the retailer.\n\nThe consumer intelligence research platform surveyed 1,471 Walmart shoppers, finding that 28% are more likely to shop at the retailer following its recent gun policy change \u2014 split into the 21% who are \u201cmuch more likely\u201d and 7% who are \u201csomewhat more likely.\u201d (A majority, however, noted that their shopping frequency at Walmart would remain unchanged.)\n\nIn addition to its gun policy changes, Walmart also requested that customers no longer openly carry firearms into Walmart and Sam\u2019s Clubs stores \u2014 even where open carry is permitted. CivicScience\u2019s survey discovered that half of 1,423 respondents were in strong support of the retailer\u2019s decision. No change in policy has been made on concealed carry by customers with permits.\n\nWalmart had been widely considered as one of the largest sellers of guns in the United States, and firearms are said to represent a significant portion of its business. But it\u2019s not the only big-name retailer that has drawn attention for changing up its firearm sales policies in the wake of deadly shootings.\n\nA year and a half has passed since Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods began the process of destroying assault-style rifles in its stores \u2014 two weeks after last February\u2019s slayings at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The Coraopolis, Pa.-based company had also raised the age restriction for purchases of firearms and ammunition to 21 as well as taken down items that resemble assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys.\n\nLate in last year\u2019s third-quarter period, Dick\u2019s CEO Edward Stack announced that the company had removed hunting products from 10 stores where the category was underperforming and replaced them with other merchandise, resulting in positive comp sales and strong margins in those locations. (It has also continued with its plan to remove hunting gear from 125 more stores this year.) This quarter, the retailer\u2019s same-store sales increased 3.2% \u2014 its strongest showing since 2016.\n\n\u201cWe saw growth across each of our three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear, our brick-and-mortar stores comped positively and our e-commerce channel remained strong,\u201d Stack said. \u201cOur key strategies and investments are working, our major headwinds are behind us and we\u2019ve bent the curve on sales.\u201d\n\nWant more?\n\nRun the Numbers: As Tariffs Loom, Consumers Might Be Deterred From Buying Big\n\nRun the Numbers: This Is the Most Instagrammed Sneaker in the World \u2014 Two Years in a Row\n\nRun the Numbers: Why the Stock Market Just Had Its Worst Day in 2019\n\nSign up for FN's Newsletter.
