Hurricane Michael demolished 85 percent of the structures in Mexico Beach last October, wiping foundations clean of vacation homes and cinder-block cottages, ripping roofs and exterior walls from businesses and scattering the contents among thousands of tooth-picked long-leaf pines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTourism is the main economic driver of Mexico Beach, and most summers, the population swells as high as 5,000. This summer, the mayor estimates, only 400 people were here.\n\nAt the Mexico Beach Welcome Center, Melissa Williams mops the floor and straightens stacks of brochures inviting visitors back to the seaside community.\n\nLately, she dreads going home to her storm-damaged house. She loves Mexico Beach, but some days, she thinks the sadness will suck her under as surely as Category 5 Michael swallowed everything in its path.\n\nHer husband, Craig Williams, had to work the night of the storm, so she took refuge at a friend\u2019s house. Together, three women, three cats, three dogs, and one cockatiel huddled on the third floor and watched movies until they lost power.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Michael\u2019s 160 mph winds threatened to blow out the French doors, the women secured them with a bungee cord and prayed the roof wouldn\u2019t go.\n\nAD\n\nLater, they emerged to a new world. A broken world. A dingy, mud-flecked landscape where roofs lay strewn across roads and boats rested uneasily in living rooms no longer suitable for living or anything other than demolition.\n\nThat\u2019s another sign you see a lot these days: \u201cOK to demo\u201d spray-painted across sheds, shops, houses, and buildings so shattered that outsiders can only guess what they must have been.\n\nAt first, the Williams home seemed okay. They spread a tarp across the roof and called themselves lucky.\n\nAD\n\nThey were wrong. One night, as Melissa and Craig lay in bed talking, they noticed a sickening odor \u2014 mold, creeping inside the walls, remaining hidden until it was too late to do anything but rip apart the entire house.\n\nLike other Mexico Beach residents, they were eager to begin repairs but were told to wait for their insurance company to settle. Appraisers set an estimate; insurance adjusters offered half of what was needed; and litigation began.\n\nAD\n\nAnd life ground to a halt as the couple sat in limbo, unable to move forward, unwilling to let go.\n\nShe is 63; he is 60. They moved to Mexico Beach in 2006 because they enjoyed camping along the Forgotten Coast. Now they camp every night in a travel trailer beside their home. This wasn\u2019t part of their retirement plan.\n\nAD\n\nThe story is the same across Mexico Beach. The city\u2019s operating budget is $3.5 million. It cost $30 million to remove debris from the canals, and total restoration is expected to top $239 million.\n\nBut city officials haven\u2019t given up hope. They\u2019re quick to point out that because many homes were rentals owned by out-of-towners, the owners don\u2019t have the same urgency to rebuild as permanent residents. Right now, there\u2019s not a lot to bring them back.\n\nThe closest gas station is 11 miles away. When residents want groceries, they have to go to the Dollar Store on St. Joe Beach or make the 20-minute drive to the Piggly Wiggly in Port St. Joe. There is no lodging. El Governor, the most famous of the original four hotels, now offers expanded views of the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 right through the bare walls, open windows and yawning doorways.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou can get lunch at Crazy Beach Pizza or a hamburger from the Mango Marley\u2019s food truck, but the seafood restaurants and bars are gone. The pier is history. The souvenir shop is no more. The bank operates out of an armored trailer. The city police department \u2014 unable to recover from losing its building, patrol cars and equipment \u2014 disbanded last month during a fractious city council meeting that ended with the Bay County Sheriff\u2019s Office taking over after a 3-2 council vote.\n\nThe one location that\u2019s thriving is Ace Hardware, owned by Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey. It\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow. Unlike many business owners, he has a steady stream of customers, but they\u2019re all buying plywood and nails to restore their own homes and workplaces to functionality.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to ignore the realty signs dangling in front of storm-scoured, weed-strewn lots. If you attempt to count them all, just along the five-mile stretch of Highway 98, you will quickly lose track. If you drive down the side roads \u2014 none of which have street signs now \u2014 you\u2019ll find so many for sale signs that you will give up the endeavor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there is another sign in Mexico Beach that offers a glimmer of hope: \u201cNot for Sale.\u201d Some residents, weary of the daily onslaught from deal-driven developers, decided to issue a strong message to opportunistic outsiders: \u201cOriginal 98 MB Not for Sale: We love our neighbors and our community.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t surprise Mayor Cathey. His family was among the first to settle in the area after the city\u2019s founding in 1949. He recalls that as a child his parents and neighbors would remind one another to \u201cguard the gates.\u201d From the beginning, they worried about the impact of commercialism and rampant residential development. The mantra kept them focused, and they enacted regulations that ensured the quality of life they wanted then and that residents treasure now.\n\nHe thought of that after the hurricane as he stumbled through the city he has lived in for most of his 71 years, no longer able to find his way around because the landmarks are gone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re vulnerable,\u201d Cathey says. \u201cWe could become something we don\u2019t want to be.\u201d\n\nHe sees the \u201cnot for sale\u201d signs as a modern version of guarding the gates. Though developers harassed residents for the first month, they met harsh rejections and eventually gave up.\n\nBut as time drags on, and work on individual homes remains at a standstill, some residents are giving up, too.\n\nMelissa and Craig Williams had intended to keep their property. This past week, they placed their home on the market. They want to stay in the area, but they say they don\u2019t have the heart to rebuild.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired,\u201d Melissa says, her eyes filling with tears. \u201cAt our ages, we just didn\u2019t want to do it. It\u2019s not that we hate Mexico Beach. We want to stay. But it\u2019s depressing. People think we\u2019re all good, but we\u2019re not good, even a year later.\u201d\n\nPerhaps they\u2019ll buy another house, she says. Or maybe they\u2019ll buy a vacant lot and put their travel trailer on it. If another storm comes, they\u2019d be able to drive away. At least they wouldn\u2019t lose everything.\n\nAD", "description": "A year after Hurricane Michael, only half of Mexico Beach\u2019s full-time residents have returned.", "authors": ["Carmen K.
