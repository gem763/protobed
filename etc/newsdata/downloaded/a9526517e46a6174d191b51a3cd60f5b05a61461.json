Schapiro reports that he awoke the next morning to a three-minute voicemail in which Giuliani is heard talking about the Biden family with an unnamed individual. Of Biden, now the frontrunner of 2020 Democrat presidential primary, Giuliani is heard contending that the former vice president meddled in Ukraine\u2019s investigation into one of the country\u2019s largest gas firms because his Hunter Biden was a member of their board. He also is heard asserting that Hunter leveraged his father\u2019s position of power to secure a $1.5 billion investment from the Bank of China.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty more to come out,\u201d Giuliani is heard saying. \u201cHe did the same thing in China. And he tried to do it in Kazakhstan and in Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad situation,\u201d the Trump lawyer went on. \u201cYou know how they get? Biden has been trading in on his public office since he was a senator.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he became vice president, the kid decided to go around the world and say, \u2018Hire me because I\u2019m Joe Biden\u2019s son.\u2019 And most people wouldn\u2019t hire him because he had a drug problem,\u201d he added.\n\nOther details from the call include mentions of the Kingdom of Bahrain and a \u201cneed\u201d for several \u201chundred thousand,\u201d presumably dollars. The context of those comments are unclear.\n\nNBC News\u2019 report comes after two Florida-based political donors linked to Giuliani pleaded not guilty to charges they illegally donated foreign funds to a political action committee favoring President Trump\u2019s re-election.\n\nThe hearing came nearly two weeks after Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman, both U.S. citizens, were arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport.\n\nTwo other men, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, also were arrested in connection with the alleged campaign finance scheme. They each pleaded not guilty to charges Thursday.\n\nThe indictments were semi-connected to an impeachment investigation by House Democrats trying to determine whether President Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for action against the Bidens. Both Trump and Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky have denied any pressure was applied to probe into the Bidens, and in a nod to transparency, the White House has released a transcript of their world leaders\u2019 call to exhibit no wrongdoing occurred.\n\n\u201cThere was no blackmail,\u201d Zelensky told reporters earlier this month. \u201cWe are not servants. We are an independent country.\u201d\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani reportedly butt-dialed a journalist and was heard discussing allegations of international corruption against the Bidens.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19210614644984-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
