Moments before Pelosi\u2019s announcement, the Senate unanimously supported a non-binding resolution calling on the White House to release the whistle-blower complaint.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Pelosi asked the six committee chairs investigating President Trump to send their most persuasive evidence for impeachment to the Judiciary Committee, which will review and decide whether to draft articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cI did not hear one word of dissent\u201d in the caucus meeting about moving impeachment investigation forward Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) told Rolling Stone.\n\nThe announcement came after a slew of caucus members called for impeachment or an impeachment inquiry on Monday night and Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ve said to people, as soon as we have the facts, we\u2019re ready,\u201d Pelosi told Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg during a previously scheduled appearance at the Atlantic Festival earlier on Tuesday. \u201cNow we have the facts. We\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s announcement comes hours after President Trump tweeted he has authorized the release of a transcript of his call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. \u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!\u201d the president wrote. Democrats, though, want more: the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, any documentation related to the acting director of national intelligence\u2019s decision to withhold the complaint, and any communication with the White House about the complaint.\n\nJoe Biden, who previously called impeachment a \u201cgigantic distraction,\u201d said Tuesday that if Trump doesn\u2019t fully comply with all investigations \u2014 including releasing the whistle-blower\u2019s full complaint, not just the transcript of the Ukraine call \u2014 Congress will have no choice but to launch an impeachment inquiry. (Biden\u2019s chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Elizabeth Warren, who previously called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings, repeated that call on Tuesday, declaring: \u201cThe House must impeach. It must start today.\u201d)\n\nMultiple news outlets have confirmed that, on the call with Zelensky, Trump repeatedly raised the prospect of an investigation into Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine during his time as vice president, according to a whistle-blower.\n\nFurther revelations surfaced Monday night indicating Trump ordered acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold $400 million in military aid for Ukraine a week before the phone call with the Ukrainian president. According to the Washington Post, which first reported the news, \u201cofficials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an \u2018interagency process\u2019 but to give them no additional information.\u201d\n\nThe funds were not released until the night of September 11th, one day after Rep. Adam Schiff, head of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, requesting a slate of documents, the full and unredacted whistle-blower complaint, and any correspondence about the complaint, including with the White House. Maguire is now scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\n\nSchiff on Tuesday afternoon revealed the news on Twitter that the whistle-blower\u2019s lawyer has indicated he would be willing to testify before the Intel committee as soon as this week.\n\nWe have been informed by the whistleblower\u2019s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so. We\u2018re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week. \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 24, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the latest round of revelations, a series of Democrats \u2014 many of them swept into Congress in the 2018 midterm elections \u2014 stepped forward to support impeachment.", "description": "Ukraine has changed Democrats' political calculus, and action now appears far more likely", "authors": ["Tessa Stuart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K9g3u9gfb3W7FamBIO8NFQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/rollingstone.com/57db54ba56d023bbc9df1131eb9326cf", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
