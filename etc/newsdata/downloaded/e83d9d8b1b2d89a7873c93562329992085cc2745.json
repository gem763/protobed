Oh, and he's hired a hardcore anti-Trump conservative lawyer to represent him.\n\nTaylor, the top American diplomat to Ukraine, will testify Tuesday in a closed Congressional session about the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to \u201clook into\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cI think Bill will give an account that lays out the way the pressure was exerted on [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky and the Ukrainians, and how he tried to caution against it,\u201d Daniel Fried, a career diplomat and former U.S. ambassador to Poland, predicted to VICE News. \u201cHe won\u2019t duck.\u201d\n\nTaylor is an especially unique threat to Trump because he\u2019s a widely-respected career diplomat with inside knowledge on Ukraine, who has already expressed alarm about the pressure campaign in no uncertain terms.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor texted former U.S Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in early September, according to previously released messages.\n\nHouse Democrats now have a golden opportunity to press Taylor about exactly what was said on that July 25 phone call \u2014 and for his take on the \u201ccrazy\u201d diplomatic overture.\n\nAn American in Ukraine\n\nTaylor was sent to Kyiv in June to serve as the top American diplomat to Ukraine on a temporary basis after the abrupt ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in May.\n\nYovanovitch\u2019s removal came at the urging of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney. Her sudden recall to Washington alarmed career State Department officials, who have been deeply critical of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for not supporting her more forcefully in the face of what\u2019s been widely seen as a right-wing smear campaign against her in the media.\n\nRead: The White House Just Admitted That There Was a Quid Pro Quo With Ukraine. What the Hell Happens Now?\n\nTaylor\u2019s appointment to replace Yovanovitch made sense, on paper: He was already deeply familiar with Ukraine, having served as U.S. ambassador in Kyiv from 2006 to 2009. Prior to returning to Kiev, he was working in D.C. as executive vice president for the U.S. Institute for Peace.\n\nBut he hardly fit the profile of someone prepared to work with Giuliani\u2019s back-door pressure campaign on Ukraine, and appeared to clash with his counterparts, Sondland and Volker.\n\nTaylor\u2019s text messages suggest he was deeply uncomfortable with their discussions.\n\nHe warned Sondland and Volker that Ukraine\u2019s president was sensitive to his country \u201cbeing taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\u201d\n\nAt another point, he raised the prospect of quitting if aid to Ukraine wasn\u2019t released.\n\nMultiple former State Department officials who spoke with VICE News described Taylor as a straight-shooting, non-partisan career diplomat.\n\nTaylor is \u201cvery loyal to public service and he knew Ukraine inside and out,\u201d and would be \u201coutraged\u201d by the notion that military aid to Ukraine \u201cwas tied to the notion of an investigation into our election, either 2016 or into the Bidens,\u201d Tara Sonenshine, a former undersecretary of State in the Obama administration who worked closely with Taylor, told VICE News.\n\nNever-Trump Lawyer\n\nTaylor has prepared for his appearance Tuesday by hiring John Bellinger, a vocally anti-Trump conservative lawyer to represent him.\n\nBellinger served in top legal roles in George W. Bush\u2019s White House and State Department before taking a public stand against Trump\u2019s candidacy during the 2016 campaign. Lately, he\u2019s allied himself with George Conway, the husband of Trump communications advisor Kellyanne Conway, in urging conservative lawyers to speak out against the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\n\nTaylor is just the latest high-level official to signal deep concerns about the State Department\u2019s role in the Ukraine saga and defy Trump\u2019s blanket ban on cooperating with the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nBellinger represents another such official: Michael McKinley, a former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who resigned in protest. McKinley testified last week that he quit because Pompeo failed to protect Yovanovitch, and because of \u201cwhat appears to be the utilization of our ambassadors overseas to advance domestic political objectives\u201d in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cConservative lawyers are not doing enough to protect constitutional principles that are being undermined by the statements and actions of this president,\u201d Bellinger told The New York Times last year.\n\nBy representing Taylor, Bellinger has inserted himself into one of the president\u2019s most dramatic disputes over the use, or abuse, of presidential power.\n\nTaylor made his own feelings on the issue pretty clear in his now-public messages to Volker and Sondland.\n\nTaylor\u2019s admonition that inserting Ukraine into U.S. politics looked \u201ccrazy\u201d left a clear paper trail for later investigators \u2014 whether intentionally or not. It prompted Sondland to reach out to Trump before replying hours later that there were \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d and insisting that future conversations happen on the phone (where there would be no record).\n\nHouse Democrats will undoubtedly ask Taylor why he was so alarmed \u2014 and those who know Taylor well say he\u2019ll likely be just as blunt in his testimony as he was in his text messages.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a straight shooter whom I would expect to answer the questions that are asked directly,\u201d said former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump gestures while speaking during a Cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Monday, Oct. 21, 2019, in Washington.
