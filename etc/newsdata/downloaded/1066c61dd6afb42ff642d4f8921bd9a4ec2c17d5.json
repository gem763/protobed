One example is browser history, which can expose users\u2019 online habits, including crypto-related site visits.\n\n\u201cMake sure you don\u2019t expose your bitcoin addresses anywhere,\u201d Welch warned.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that some extensions capture users\u2019 KYC information and can leak it to scammers. The only major multisig system that requires KYC at the moment is the one supplied by Unchained Capital, Welch said. He warns against commonly-used consumer software that gathers identity data.\n\nAs an example, Welch demonstrated how an extension providing wallpapers with inspiring quotes or other content was actually stealing data as you filled in KYC forms. The malware stole graphical data, like a photo of your driver\u2019s license, which is captured as a code and then easily decoded, providing an actual picture of your ID document to hackers.\n\nQuiet data thefts\n\nAll this is happening on the background, without the user noticing.\n\n\u201cYou got a nice background here and you don\u2019t realize that your browser is actually dumping data,\u201d Welch said.\n\nThe same wallpaper extension can alter a receiving address when you\u2019re trying to send your crypto to somebody else (or to yourself), sending it to a scammer\u2019s wallet instead. The ubiquity and popularity of browser extensions makes the situation quite dangerous, Welch noted:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying, right? We all are using browser extensions all the time.\u201d\n\nEven if a user is very careful and selective in what they\u2019re using, the software can be upgraded and get new, unsafe features without a consumer noticing, Welch added.\n\nWelch noted that many well-known applications are gathering personal data including password managers, text editing app Grammarly, Joule extension for in-browser Lighting transactions, and the Lolli bitcoin-earning extension.\n\nThe solution? There is no easy one, Welch says. Developers can only keep building better tools that will make users\u2019 experience safer and better.\n\n\u201cWe all need to be discussing this issues more, because we\u2019re not even in the phase yet when real attacks will be taking place.\u201d\n\nWelch added that Casa is planning to publish more security research soon and encouraged bitcoin developers and entrepreneurs to approach the company and share their concerns and ideas on how to address security issues.\n\nImage of Jeremy Welch by Anna Baydakova for CoinDesk", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jeremy-Welch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
