When I tweeted about her remarks earlier today, my timeline quickly filled with replies such as \u201cHitler also liked using pigtailed propaganda girls\u201d and \u201cShe is a prop and a tool for eco-communism. A propaganda icon that needs to be destroyed.\u201d Of course, President Trump weighed in, posting a clip of her speech and commenting sarcastically, \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d\n\nBut despite the volume and vitriol of the attacks directed her way, it\u2019s vitally important that the worldview she represents and the policies she espouses are refuted. Like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D\u2013N.Y.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D\u2013Mass.), and a host of other American politicians, Thunberg believes that we\u2019ve only got a few years left to settle the fate of the planet, a basic tenet pushed by supporters of the Green New Deal and by most of the Democrats running for president. In fact, Thunberg thinks that \u201ccutting our emissions in half in 10 years,\u201d the target invoked by many environmentalists, is too little, too late.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nick Gillespie", "Reason.Com Think-Globally-Shame-Constantly-The-Rise-Of-Greta-Thunberg-Environmentalism"], "top_image": ""}
