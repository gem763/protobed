We feel incredibly proud for taking part in such an important day - Mery Perell\u00f3 and Rafa Nadal's wedding,\" she wrote.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"We would like to congratulate the gorgeous and unique couple, we wish you the best forever! Rosa Clar\u00e1 is the designer of Mery Perell\u00f3's wedding dress, an exquisitely clean-lined haute couture design.\n\n\"The bodice, with jewel neckline and long sleeves, was made of beautiful Art Deco-inspired French lace with delicate patterning, flower motifs and microbeading on the meticulously hand-embroidered fabric.\n\n\"The ballgown-style skirt, made of silk crepe, featured a weightless detachable train, created in Rosa Clara's Atelier. The whole process was full of emotions between all of us. We just want to thank the whole family for trusting in us, you're extraordinary,\" she added.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAmong the A-listers arriving at the fortress on Saturday were former king Juan Carlos I of Spain, who was brought in by private car, and retired tennis players Carlos Moya and David Ferrer, along with his wife Marta Tornel.\n\nSpanish player Feliciano Lopez was also there, along with former Argentinean champ Juan Monaco.\n\nXisca, who works as an insurance worker and project director for the Rafa Nadal Foundation, had kept the details of her wedding dress totally secret before their big day.\n\n(Image: Joan Llado / GTres / SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: Lliteres/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n(Image: Cati Cladera/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe newlyweds also went to extreme lengths to protect their wedding from prying eyes, even putting up an enormous marquee over the fortress and closing the air space above it to prevent choppers from flying over.\n\nGuests were seen gathering beforehand at a checkpoint to be picked up by a shuttle bus employed solely to take them into the virtually impregnable fortress.\n\n(Image: Ezequiel Ivan Espinar Riutort/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n(Image: Ezequiel Ivan Espinar Riutort/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nRafa's uncle, Miguel Angel Nadal, was spotted wearing a crisp white shirt and navy blue suit trousers with sunglasses as he milled around with other family members before the bus arrived.\n\nThe female guests went all-out for the big day, opting for floor-skimming designer dresses and teetering high hells for the glamorous occasion.\n\nThe 17th-century fortress is owned by Conservative party donor Lord Lupton, who bought it in 2011 for a cool \u00a330million - a bargain considering it went on the market at \u00a375million.\n\n(Image: Cati Cladera/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n(Image: Cati Cladera/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n(Image: Joan Llado / GTres / SplashNews.com)\n\nIt was the wedding venue for footballer Gareth Bale and his wife Emma Rhys-Jones' lavish nuptials in July this year, and was also the setting for the 2016 BBC spy thriller The Night Manager, starring Hugh Laurie, Olivia Colman and Tom Hiddleston.\n\nBlushing bride Xisca was seen the day before her wedding running some last-minute errands in Majorca.\n\n(Image: MEGA)\n\nThe bride-to-be was seen chatting on the phone as she made her way to a beauty salon, no doubt for a little bridal pampering.\n\nShe wore an elegant pleated skirt with a simple white t-shirt, packing her essentials into a red handbag and finishing off her look with flat sandals and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nXisca and Rafa kept their engagement a secret for eight months before coming clean in January this year.\n\n(Image: Cati Cladera/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n(Image: Cati Cladera/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nSpeaking to Spanish magazine Hola!, Rafa confirmed that he proposed to his long-term partner during a romantic holiday to Rome.\n\nXisca regularly travels the world to watch his tennis matches and cheer him on from the audience, and was with him in Melbourne for the Australian Open 2019.\n\n(Image: Aurelien Meunier/EPA/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"I had chance to visit Sydney, I haven't been there before. So I was knowing a little bit of the city and we enjoyed it. After ten years finally, my girlfriend gets a wildcard to come here,\" he said in January.\n\nRafa has previously opened up about the pair's plan to have kids, telling Hello! magazine: \"Obviously, I have the intention of forming a family. I love children and I would like my children to do what they like.\"\n\nMery prefers to keep out of the spotlight, instead working in the relative anonymity of the insurance industry.\n\n(Image: Joan Llado / GTres / SplashNews.com)\n\nShe also works for her fiance's Rafa Nadal Foundation charity as a project director, but shuns the spotlight to give Rafa the chance to focus on his work.\n\n\"He needs his space when he is competing and just the idea of me hanging around and waiting on his needs all day tires me out,\" she told the Telegraph in 2011.\n\n\"It would asphyxiate me. And then he would have to be worrying about me. If I followed him everywhere I think there's a risk we might stop getting along.\"\n\nCongratulations to Rafa and Xisca!", "description": "Tennis ace Rafa Nadal and Maria Perello tied the knot in front of a star-studded audience in a beautiful fortress - and he's now broken his silence about the top-secret wedding", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Instagram", "Solarpix.Com", "Joan Llado", "Gtres", "Splashnews.Com", "Lliteres Epa-Efe Rex", "Cati Cladera Epa-Efe Rex", "Ezequiel Ivan Espinar Riutort Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13928773.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN_Rafa-Nadal-Xisca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
