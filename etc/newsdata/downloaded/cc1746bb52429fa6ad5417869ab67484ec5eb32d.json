If it looks like they'll go over the number of kilowatt hours, they'll get a message warning them, and then they'll get a top-up pack of kilowatt hours, charged at the same rate as the subscription plan.\n\nIf customers don't use their allotted kilowatt hours in a month, they'll just roll over to the next month.\n\nWe will force the classic energy suppliers to change the way they do things, exactly as we did in mobile. \u2014 Peter O'Connell, Amaysim co-founder\n\n\"Over a year, your use of electricity goes up dramatically in winter, so you want to carry over what you didn't use in autumn, and similarly it goes up in summer, so you want to carry over what you didn't use in spring,\" O'Connell notes.\n\nIf all of that sounds familiar, that's because it is \u2013 Amaysim is basing its energy subscription service on its mobile phone subscription service.\n\nAnd with the help of smart electricity meters (which get installed as part of the subscription), O'Connell's plan is to get Australians to think of kilowatt hours the same way they think about gigabytes: they may not understand exactly what they are, but they quickly come to understand how many of them they need each month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis plan, too, is to force Australia's largest energy retailers to follow suit, much as Australia's largest telcos followed Amaysim into simplified billing for mobile phone services.\n\n\"Subscription electricity services will be a lot cheaper than classical electricity services to begin with,\" he says. \"But we will force the classic energy suppliers to change the way they do things, exactly as we did in mobile.\"\n\nIman Ghodosi, vice-president of the subscription economy software provider Zuora, says the shift to subscription services in industries such as electricity and automobiles is partly driven by economics and partly a generational shift.\n\n\"Millennials are more interested in the outcomes that derive from products than in the products themselves,\" Ghodosi told The Australian Financial Review ahead of Zuora's Subscribed conference in Sydney this week.\n\nIn the USA and Germany, BMW lets you \"subscribe\" to its cars for a monthly fee, changing from model to model depending on your needs at the time. Manufacturers such as Ford and Toyota, meanwhile, are now finding they can get a greater share of wallet if they offer their goods direct to customers as subscriptions, bundled with the services that are associated with those goods.\n\nBy 2023, three quarters of all companies selling products direct to customers will offer subscriptions. \u2014 Gartner Consulting\n\nCar makers can make more money if they offer subscriptions that incorporate not just the cost of the car, but also other costs such as registration, insurance and even road tolls, Ghodosi says.\n\nAmaysim's O'Connell is quick to point out that this share-of-wallet aspect of the subscription economy applies only to companies which were once selling physical products. Amaysim's subscription energy service will have a lower share of wallet than traditional energy services, at least until the big power companies are forced to bring their prices down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile automobile makers themselves have yet to pursue subscriptions in Australia the way they have overseas, third-parties such as CarBar and Blinker offer car subscriptions across the makes.\n\nCarBar's weekly subscription fee includes insurance, registration, maintenance, roadside assistance and lets customers switch between Ford, Kia, Volkswagen, Peugeot, Toyota and other makes, as often as every two weeks.\n\nThe future of subscriptions\n\nThe consulting firm Frost & Sullivan estimates that by 2025, almost 10 per cent of new car sales in the USA and Europe will come as part of a subscription, representing a business opportunity worth $US100 billion ($147 billion) to the automotive industry.\n\nAnother consulting company, Gartner, estimates that by 2023, three-quarters of all companies selling products direct to customers will offer subscriptions to those products as part of their sales strategy.\n\nOnce goods and services have shifted over to subscription-oriented models, it might even be possible to combine them into mega-subscriptions.\n\n\"I can imagine one day we just have a 'utility subscription',\" says O'Connell.\n\n\"It costs you $600 a month or whatever, and it gives you water, electricity, gas, rates, mobile phone, everything in one subscription.\"", "description": "One day, we may think of kilowatt hours the same way we think about gigabytes: we may not understand what they are, but we know how many of them we need.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3586%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_595%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8f83480c287a5bcc39326bf5043066d93774b210", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
