His refusal left Trump increasingly frustrated, and there was deep friction between the two over the issue, one of the people said.\n\nObjections Registered\n\nOn Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported that Trump pressed Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting in the second half of 2017 to help get the case against Zarrab dropped. After the encounter, Tillerson pulled then-Chief of Staff John Kelly aside in a hallway and reiterated his objections, saying the request was illegal.\n\nThe New York Times later reported that Giuliani and former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who were both working for Zarrab, made their case in a prior meeting with Trump and Tillerson in early 2017, months after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAnother person familiar with the events at the time said Giuliani even showed up unannounced at the Justice Department and requested a meeting with top officials to discuss the case. The Department never seriously considered the idea of the prisoner swap, the person said.\n\nRead More: U.S. Inquiry Into Turkish Bank Inflamed Erdogan, Then Went Quiet\n\nThe latest reporting shows that the specific episode wasn\u2019t isolated and that the president remained concerned with the Zarrab case, which was a high priority for both Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nSwap Sought\n\nIn a phone interview earlier this week, Giuliani -- who became one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers in April 2018 -- initially denied he\u2019d ever raised Zarrab\u2019s case with the president, but later said he might have done so. He acknowledged he spoke with U.S. officials as part of his effort to arrange a swap of Zarrab for Brunson, who was eventually freed in 2018.\n\nZarrab was being prosecuted on charges of evading U.S. sanctions against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. He\u2019d hired Mukasey and Giuliani, who\u2019s said he reached out repeatedly to U.S. officials to seek a diplomatic solution for his client outside the courts.\n\nAfter his arrest in Miami in early 2016, prosecutors alleged Zarrab had \u201cclose ties\u201d with Erdogan. They accused him of using his network of companies to move money through the U.S. financial system with the goal of helping Iran evade sanctions as the U.S. was stepping up economic pressure on Tehran.\n\nRead More: Trump Urged Top Aide to Help Giuliani Client Facing DOJ Charges\n\nZarrab later pleaded guilty and testified against Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who headed international banking at state-owned Turkiye Halk Bankasii AS, known as Halkbank. Zarrab said Erdogan knew of and supported the laundering effort on behalf of Iran. Erdogan and other senior Turkish officials repeatedly rejected the accusations, saying they were fabrications.\n\nAtilla was eventually convicted of helping Iran evade economic sanctions on billions of dollars of oil revenue and served 28 months in U.S. prison.\n\nTillerson, the former chief executive officer of oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp., was fired by Trump in a March 2018 tweet. At a forum with Bob Schieffer of CBS News in December, he said the president frequently asked him to do things that were illegal, adding that \u201che got really frustrated when we\u2019d have those conversations.\u201d\n\nTrump hosted Brunson in the Oval Office in October 2018 when the American returned to the U.S. after almost two years in a Turkish prison. The pair will be together again on Saturday, when Trump attends the \u201cValue Voters Summit\u201d in Washington for a dinner in Brunson\u2019s honor.\n\n--With assistance from Jennifer Jacobs.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Nick Wadhams in Washington at nwadhams@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Kevin Whitelaw at kwhitelaw@bloomberg.net, ;Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump repeatedly pressed then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for help getting a criminal case dropped against a client of Rudy Giuliani, long after the top U.S. diplomat made clear he felt the idea was inappropriate, said two people familiar with the matter.Tillerson", "authors": ["Nick Wadhams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
