KR, -2.04% was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies, with analysts expressing diminished confidence in the grocer's ability to turn its partnership with Ocado Group PLC OCDO, +0.27% into growth. In May 2018, the two companies announced that Kroger had taken a 5% stake in Ocado through a $247 million stock purchase. The technology deal includes automated warehouses and other measures. Jefferies analysts say the tie-up has been \"costly\" and \"risky,\" that pricing versus Kroger's grocery competitor Walmart Inc. WMT, +0.40% hasn't improved, and there are no drivers for same-store progress in fiscal 2020. Jefferies said the deal \"is a poor and significant long-term capital allocation misstep when compared to micro-fulfillment.\" Jefferies lowered its price target to $26 from $29. \"Chances of a meaningful resurgence in same-store sales are slim given management's inability to effectively articulate a sound strategy to revive its core biz and our belief that superior retailers like Walmart will continue to realize outsized share gains,\" the note said. Kroger stock is down 1.8% in Thursday premarket trading, and down 10.8% for the year to date. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.97% has gained 16.5% for 2019 so far.", "description": "Kroger Co. was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies, with analysts expressing diminished confidence in the grocer's ability to turn its partnership with...", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
