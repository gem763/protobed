It will come, it takes a very inclusive approach\u201d.\n\nMacron hit back at Bolsonaro\u2019s accusations that Paris had no role to play, saying that French Guiana, a French overseas territory in South America, shared a more than 700-kilometre border with Brazil, making it a player in protecting rainforests.\n\nFrance would contribute $100 million out of $500 million in the package, Macron said. Germany, Britain and the European Union were also among the contributors to investments in biodiversity preservation and lasting development.\n\n\u201cHalting deforestation and restoring degraded forests are global imperatives,\u201d said U.N. Secretary General Antonio Gutteres, who also spoke on Monday at the U.N. Climate Action Summit.\n\n\u201cFor every dollar spent restoring degraded forests, as much as $30 can be recouped in economic benefits and poverty reduction,\u201d Gutteres said.\n\nMany of the fires sweeping through the Amazon are thought to have been started deliberately in Brazil, with environmentalists blaming speculators who burn vegetation to clear it in hopes of selling the land to farmers and ranchers.\n\nThe Amazon is often described as \u201cthe lungs of the world\u201d because of its vast ability to absorb carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cAs we destroy the world\u2019s forests, we drive ever more species to extinction, we erode nature\u2019s ability to cope with climate change and we undermine the livelihoods of millions of people,\u201d British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.\n\n\u201cThe UK recognises that we are at a tipping point and that action now is both urgent and essential.\u201d", "description": "International donors agreed on Monday to free up more than $500 million (\u00a3402.4 million) in aid to protect tropical rainforests, including the Amazon where wildfires are raging, France's president said on Monday at a U.N. meeting shunned by Brazil.", "authors": ["John Irish", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
