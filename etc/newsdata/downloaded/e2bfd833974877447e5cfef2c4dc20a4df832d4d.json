With a seriously strict budget and plenty of side hustles.\n\nWhile the couple, who both worked as civil servants, don\u2019t want to reveal the exact figure they saved, they say they now have enough to mean they\u2019ll never work another day in their lives.\n\nThat\u2019s great news for their children, Sunoa, 13, and Melea, 11, who now get to spend a load of time with their parents.\n\nThe family has now moved from San Francisco to Lisbon, Portugal to live a life of leisure. Anyone else jealous?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmon, who brought home $98,000 a year as an urban planner, and Christina, who earned $70,000 as a federal attorney, insisted that almost anybody can retire early if they follow their example and join the Financial Independence Retire Early movement, known as FIRE.\n\nThey saved money through flipping houses, working as Uber and Lyft drivers, and moving to Japan to live rent-free for three years (Picture: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nChristina said: \u2018The FIRE journey is all about saving money, making money and investing that money.\n\n\u2018But before you do all that, you have to believe that you can do it. It\u2019s about your mindset.\u2019\n\nAmon realised he wanted to retire early when he received an award for ten years service at work in 2011.\n\nHe said: \u2018That was a life changing moment. You can work for so many years and all you get to show for it is a piece of paper.\n\n\u2018I really wanted more out of life than this.\n\n\u2018The idea of working another 30 years in a cubicle and missing out on life was crazy to me.\u2019\n\nChristina and Amon worked together to create FIRE, which now has thousands of followers working to put away enough money to ditch the world of work.\n\nTheyre now able to spend more time with their children, Sunoa and Melea (Picture: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nThey gave themselves a ten-year plan to become financially independent and able to retire by 2021.\n\nIn 2013 they began flipping homes, buying their first fixer-upper in the San Francisco area by putting just 3% of the property price down, which was $17,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey lived in the home while they did it up, sold it, and then did the same thing again with two more properties, allowing them to gain over $400,000 in profit.\n\nThe couple also sold spare possessions on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace, and signed up to become Uber and Lyft \u2013 they say they earned $26,000 without ever having to pick up any passengers.\n\nAmon said: \u2018For a period we drove for Uber and Lyft in the San Francisco bay area.\n\n\u2018For us, it was all about the hack. The companies were giving $40 an hour just to turn on the app.\n\n\u2018We would literally get no rides but we\u2019d still get the sign-up bonus.\n\n\u2018I think we made $26,000 just on this Uber and Lyft hack, not driving at all.\u2019\n\nAll the extra money went into low-cost index funds.\n\nAmon Browing on his last day of work (Picture: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nAmon said: \u2018You start off with investing all your tax advantage accounts \u2013 the ones you have at work, your retirement funds.\n\n\u2018In our 401k, we invested in an index fund that tracked the stock markets, we weren\u2019t dabbling in individual stocks.\n\n\u2018The return on the stock market is historically eight to 10% so we just plowed our extra money into the index funds.\u2019\n\nThe family made some lifestyle changes, too, including trading in a BMW for an $800 minivan\n\nThey also made changes in their lifestyle including trading in their brand new BMW SUV for an $800 minivan. But the parents made sure that throughout their scrimping and saving, the family was still able to have fun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach year Amon and Christina used sign up bonuses on credit cards to pay for a big holiday, heading on vacations to Thailand, Hawaii, and Singapore.\n\nThe family want to prioritise adventure (Picture: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nThe couple are sharing their story to show other parents that they can save enough money to retire early.\n\nAmon said: \u2018When people say that children are expensive \u2013 you make children expensive if you are trying to give them the world.\n\n\u2018People will go broke for their children but they won\u2019t become rich for them.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve seen people overspend on toys and activities. But we never found our children to be expensive. We have a minimalist mindset.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t give out gifts at Christmas but we went on trips.\n\n\u2018Our girls can remember that they were in Paris on Christmas Day or in Singapore or in Thailand.\u2019\n\nThey went on one big holiday a year using signup bonuses from credit cards (Picture: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nIn 2016 their savings got a boost when the couple moved to Japan with work, where they lived rent-free. This allowed them to save 70% of their income and invest it for three years.\n\nFollowing that time, the couple hit their goal of financial independence two years earlier than expected. They were able to retire in July this year, then moved to Portugal because of its weather, education, health care, and the low cost of living.\n\nThe family\u2019s outgoings are now around $4,500 a month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmon and Christina now spend their days with their children, taking Portuguese classes, traveling around Europe and focussing on their physical fitness, with Christina swimming and Amon playing basketball.\n\nThey also focus on their Youtube channel, Our Rich Journey, where they share their tips and tricks on achieving FIRE.\n\nAmon said: \u2018We just took 40 hours a week back.\n\n\u2018We are so busy every single day.\n\n\u2018What type of life is it commuting to work every day and sitting at your desk?\n\n\u2018I can organize my own life and my own day now.\n\n\u2018What is most important is that we are not tired at the end of the day when we meet our children.\n\n\u2018We have the energy to keep up with them.\u2019\n\nMORE: How I Save: The 28-year-old senior marketing executive in Manchester with \u00a316,750 saved\n\nMORE: Girl designs Christmas cards to raise money for accessible room for disabled brother\n\nMORE: How I Save: The 24-year-old blogger and consultant with \u00a375,000 saved\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Amon and Christina Browning spent eight years with a strict budget so they could retire in their forties.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/837293_Retired-f8c9_1572089885.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
