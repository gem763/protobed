It was the first time the Chiefs have been held below 26 points since Patrick Mahomes took over as the team's starting quarterback.\n\nBut supporting that defensive effort was an impressive rushing attack from the Colts led by the offensive line and Marlon Mack. He went off for 132 yards on 29 carries and was a key factor in sealing the victory in the fourth quarter.\n\nRead more: Top 13 waiver-wire pickups for Week 6 of fantasy football\n\nAccording to head coach Frank Reich, relying on the run was a part of the plan all along, and a key component of the team's success was a complete buy-in from quarterback Jacoby Brissett.\n\nAfter the game, Reich told Peter King of NBC Sports that Brissett had total confidence in Mack and the offensive line to close out the win.\n\n\"Before our last series, Jacoby said to me, 'Hey, let's go run it down their throats,'\" Reich told King.\n\nIt had been apparent all day that the Colts' best way of attacking the Chiefs' defense was on the ground, and Mack made the most of his opportunities.\n\nThe idea of running between the tackles to close out a game might seem a bit quaint in the modern NFL, especially against the mad-dash offensive attack of the Chiefs. But for the Colts, it was the right call, allowing Brissett and the offense to control the clock and tempo of the game's final stretch.\n\nWith the Colts holding a 13-10 lead heading into the fourth quarter, Indianapolis committed to running the ball with great success.\n\nAfter taking over possession close to midfield, the Colts worked the clock on a methodical 14-play 35-yard drive that ate up 8:34 to set up a field goal. When their defense forced a turnover on downs, Indianapolis repeated the attack, forcing the Chiefs to use their time-outs and putting up another field goal to take a two-score lead at 19-10.\n\nBy the time the Chiefs got the ball back, they had needed to score twice in the final 2:27 of the game to win but managed only a field goal. The Colts ran the ball on 17 of their last 19 plays from scrimmage and ran the clock and their opponent's chances out with it.\n\nWith the win, the Colts moved to 3-2 on the season \u2014 a result Indianapolis fans have to be pleased with after the abrupt retirement of Andrew Luck threatened to cut their hopes before the year even began.\n\nSteelers quarterback Mason Rudolph knocked out cold after hit but walks off field in scary scene\n\nRaiders knocked out of field goal range after Richie Incognito gets flagged for shoving a Bears player's face into the ground\n\nFormer NFL wide receiver Percy Harvin says he was high for every game he played in his 8-year career\n\nPatrick Mahomes has joined the exclusive '99 Club' in 'Madden 20.'
