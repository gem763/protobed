He\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s 100 percent,\u201d assistant coach Ian Foster said, also grinning.\n\nRetallick sustained the dislocation and nerve damage when he was illegally cleared out of a ruck by South Africa\u2019s RG Snyman in a test on July 27. Retallick accepted the injury as part of the game. \u201cI\u2019m not owed an apology,\u201d he said.\n\nA former world player of the year and 2015 World Cup winner, Retallick thought he was going to miss this tournament until a few days before the squad announcement. He was aqua jogging with his wife in a pool when he felt the shoulder click into place. After a sharp, brief pain, he could lift his arm above his head for the first time since the injury. He\u2019s been improving since then.\n\nThe All Blacks are gambling on Retallick being available for the quarterfinals, which start on Oct. 19. At this point, the shoulder has full motion, it\u2019s almost as strong as it was, he\u2019s been lifting for a week, and undergoing soft contact on tackle bags. He has to pass full contact and tackle tests.\n\nFoster said the veteran lock\u2019s progress is ahead of schedule and everyone\u2019s excited.\n\n\u201cWill he be playing in pool play? Don\u2019t know. Is there a chance? Yes, there is,\u201d Foster said. \u201cHave a bit of patience.\u201d\n\nRetallick said he\u2019s not available for New Zealand\u2019s next match against Canada on Oct. 2 in Oita. The All Blacks face have Namibia and Italy after that.\n\nFoster said they have played a lot of rugby without Retallick, and are content with their three fit locks: Sam Whitelock has been getting through a mountain of work, Scott Barrett was doing the things Retallick usually did, and Patrick Tuipulotu had found his test legs this year.\n\n\u201cWhen Brodie\u2019s there, he brings composure to our group, but his absence has given a massive opportunity, particularly for Scott and Patty, to grow up into that space,\u201d Foster said. \u201cIf we can get Brodie back playing 100%, we\u2019re in a pretty good position.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks have plans for their remaining pool games, too, Foster added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got three more opportunities to hone our game and to get it to the point we need it to be at,\u201d he said. We\u2019ve got two opportunities against Canada and Namibia to really grow confidence in some parts of our game we\u2019re still not quite right with.\n\n\u201cThe World Cup is about living your standards daily. The minute we think we\u2019ve had one good game, and we\u2019ve made it, we\u2019re going to get smacked. The only way we\u2019re going to progress any further is if we keep trying to meet our own expectations on a daily basis. There\u2019ll certainly be no loosening of the reins over the next 10 days.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If the decision was left to Brodie Retallick, he'd be running out for the All Blacks next week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
