By one estimate, the S&P 500\u2019s decline in the event of another breakdown in talks would be more than double its potential gain if the two sides reached some kind of truce.\n\nThe benchmark gauge may vault back to all-time highs, or a 3% gain from current levels, should trade discussions progress favorably, according to Chris Harvey, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo. On the the other hand, if tensions escalate and stocks follow past patterns, the index may fall 7% to 2,750, he said.\n\nInvestors just got a taste of the extreme reactions as stocks tumbled overnight amid fears of a breakdown in negotiations, only to rally back on Thursday morning as President Donald Trump confirmed talks will continue Friday. Caution prevails, with a mini deal expected, as the U.S. and China began two days of talks aimed at easing hostilities in their 18-month trade war.\n\n\u201cThe trade discussion is just sucking oxygen from everything else at this moment,\u201d George Mateyo, chief investment officer at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, said by phone. \u201cThis is going to be an on-going tug-of-war for a while. I don\u2019t think either side is ready to capitulate just yet.\u201d\n\nStocks today are trading around the same level where they were two years ago when Trump touched off conflicts with major trading partners, compounding an economic deceleration. This week\u2019s talks with China are expected to lead to a d\u00e9tente, in which a planned Oct. 15 tariff hike will be put on \u201cindefinite hold,\u201d according to Don Straszheim, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of China research, and Sarah Bianchi, the firm\u2019s head of political analysis.\n\nInvestors will be disappointed if the current round of talks lead nowhere. Over the past two years, the market has sold off an average 9% in the three instances when Trump added or implemented new tariffs near market highs, according to data compiled by Wells Fargo.\n\nThe trade talks come as some technical forces are poised to exacerbate market moves in either direction. Options dealers who sold put contracts and had to sell shares to hedge as markets tumbled are now sitting with positions that will require them to reload if stocks turn higher. If the market falls, they\u2019d be forced to sell.\n\nSuch \u201cshort gamma\u201d exposure currently stands at $6.88 billion, or about 13th percentile since 2013, Nomura Securities estimated.\n\nThis \u201cwill keep us \u201cchase-y\u201d two ways,\u201d said Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at Nomura. \u201cThe \u2018to delay or not delay\u2019 determination on this next tranche of tariffs from President Trump will almost single-handedly dictate the either of the two binary outcomes being priced-in.\u201d\n\nInvestors have kept a defensive posture over the past year, shunning cyclical stocks in favor of low-volatility and dividend shares, partly because of trade uncertainties. Any de-escalation is likely to spur risk appetite, according to Harvey at Wells Fargo.\n\n\u201cMarkets will reach new highs at the expense of the more defensive stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep in mind a potential \u2018pile on\u2019 scenario, as a notable amount of investors are not positioned for the upside scramble.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lu Wang in New York at lwang8@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, Richard Richtmyer, Dave Liedtka\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Traders can be forgiven for being glued to trade headlines because the stakes are so high.
