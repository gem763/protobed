The most recent round of talks, earlier this month in Washington, helped forestall a new set of tariff hikes that would have escalated tensions.\n\n\u201cI really like what they\u2019re saying on the other side,\u201d Economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business. If current talks go well, he said, Trump might put off imposing more tariffs planned for December. But he added, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee it, it\u2019s completely up to the president.\u201d\n\nThe CAC 40 in Paris reversed early losses and was flat at 5,650 in midday trading, while Germany\u2019s DAX picked up 0.3% to 12,770. London\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 0.3%, to 7,188, with a Brexit deadline looming.\n\nJust nine days before Britain\u2019s deadline for leaving the 28-nation European bloc, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and lawmakers were facing off over the latest departure plan.\n\nLawmakers were due to vote Tuesday on whether to approve the deal in principle and then on a schedule for debating it and possible amendments.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said EU leaders would decide on whether to postpone the Oct. 31 deadline by three months depending on what the British parliament decides.\n\nWall Street was set for a tepid start, with the future contract for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P; 500 futures both set to open flat or slightly higher.\n\nWhile markets seemed to reflect some optimism on the U.S.-China trade front, some analysts have been skeptical.\n\nIn a commentary, Mizuho Bank said \u201cwe think the current wave of trade optimism may be short-lived.\u201d\n\nIt noted that negotiations were said to be going well before they collapsed in May. And talk of a partial deal suggests many issues will remain unresolved.\n\n\u201cWhilst scrapping of the upcoming December tariff is welcomed, this may be only marginally positive since a substantial degree of damage is already done from the existing tariffs,\u201d it said.\n\nAs they wait for trade talk developments, investors are watching corporate earnings reports after a relatively quiet Monday.\n\nIn Asian trading, the Kospi in South Korea led gains, climbing 1.2% to 2,090.77 after a rally in technology companies overnight on Wall Street. Australia\u2019s S&P; ASX 200 added 0.3% to 6,672.20. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong picked up 0.2% to 26,786.20, while the Shanghai Composite index reversed early losses to close 0.5% higher at 2,954.38. India\u2019s Sensex skidded 0.6% to 39,073.82.\n\nTokyo\u2019s markets were closed for a holiday marking the ascension of Emperor Naruhito to Japan\u2019s Chrysanthemum Throne.\n\nBenchmark crude oil rose 23 cents to $53.54 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nBrent crude oil, the international standard, picked up 35 cents to $59.31 a barrel.\n\nThe dollar was holding at 108.60 yen from Monday. The euro fell to $1.1136 from $1.1149.\n\n___\n\nMatt Ott in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Global stock markets were rising Tuesday, spurred by upbeat talk from President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials on the status of trade negotiations with China.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Elaine Kurtenbach"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/south_korea_financial_markets_96966_c0-68-4000-2401_s1200x700.jpg?272bd3e1e5c37c51ef61bbb44a5b4cd480a787f0", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
