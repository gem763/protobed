It\u2019s almost painful for us to type this as the fashion brand was a #realone that always came through for us.\n\nThere\u2019s a themed party coming up but you don\u2019t have a single thing in your closet of that color\u2014Forever 21. You\u2019re in dire need of a pair of classic gold hoops to match a sleek black outfit for a business meeting\u2014Forever 21. You just moved to Japan and discovered, painfully, that your feet are way too big for any of the shoes at your local shoe store\u2014Forever 21.\n\nEverything storewide is up to 70 percent off ladies, so grab your wallet and take this list of our go-to items to buy before the mega fashion brand leaves Japan forever.\n\nGlam Accessories\n\nHuge hoop earrings will always be a staple for fierce ladies and baddies putting in work. As they say, the bigger the hoop, the bigger the\u2026 brain. That\u2019s how the saying goes, right?\n\nChunky belts, iconic Jackie O sunglasses, and charm necklaces are staples for every closet that Forever 21 sells on the cheap. Perfect for when you have an unexpected Bumble date to a fancy restaurant and need a posh clutch to keep your valuables in.\n\nBe sure to snag one of the seasonal scarves that are almost guaranteed to be flying off the shelves right now. And more layers doesn\u2019t mean less sexy; leopard print anything ferociously screams fierce.\n\nSavvy\u2019s Recommended Pick: The classic gold hoops, of course! You can often get them in a variety set so you get a number of different sizes.\n\nThe Most Random Graphic Tees\n\nYou totally need a casual T-shirt with everyone\u2019s favorite horror classic, Jaws. Or one with the faces of all five guardians from the Sailor Moon series, complete with the caption, \u201cbeautiful girl warriors.\u201d From the obscure to the ones that make us go, but why though, Forever 21\u2019s graphic tee game is strong.\n\nWe absolutely love this cropped sweatshirt that takes us back to our childhood when VHS rental shops were all the rage. Blockbuster, America\u2019s favorite video store, you\u2019ll forever live on in our memories via this sweatshirt.\n\nSavvy\u2019s Recommended Pick: A pullover hoodie with a graphic that gives you all the nostalgic feels.\n\nCrops Tops Galore\n\nWe know it\u2019s getting colder now, but if you\u2019re a festival-goer, we bet you\u2019re already planning out your schedule for Summer Sonic or Fuji Rock next year. Barely-there crop tops are the epitome of festival wear and no one does it better than Forever 21.\n\nEveryone knows how trendy crop tops are, but the brand takes it to the next level. Frilly and puffy \u201csleeves\u201d that don\u2019t cover the shoulders and crop \u201ctops\u201d that barely fit the name because it\u2019s quite literally just a small, thin piece of fabric. That\u2019s the beauty of what Forever 21 stands for though\u2014cheap, funky clothes that spice up our lives.\n\nRemember that cropped sweatshirt we mentioned earlier? There\u2019s a whole section of them. They won\u2019t keep you warm during the winter, but style-wise they\u2019ll make you look nothing short of a total bosslady.\n\nSavvy\u2019s Recommended Pick: A bright-colored crop top so you\u2019ll be easy to find in a sea of people at your next music festa!\n\nEverything Denim\n\nFor real though, Forever 21 has a denim version of almost everything from actual jeans to rompers to backpacks.\n\nRipped up shorts give us all the summer feels, while stonewashed denim jeans will always be in season. We\u2019re especially fans of the oh-so-comfy \u201cboyfriend jeans\u201d with their relaxed fit. Throw on a denim button-up jacket for a 90s throwback look or rock some distressed thigh-high denim boots because you are one hundred percent that\u2026 boss.\n\nSavvy\u2019s Recommended Pick: Distressed boyfriend jeans are a grungy yet sexy twist on a classic pair of denim pants\u2014a staple for your closet.\n\nShoes (That Fit)\n\nAny foreign woman in Japan knows #thestruggleisreal when it comes to finding shoes that fit us. Once again, Forever 21 has got our backs. Strappy sandals, platform boots, and stilettos galore.\n\nGive us all the leopard-print heels for a splash of sass during girls\u2019 night, or just some chill flats to wear on a date to the park. And you definitely don\u2019t want to miss the incredible selection of faux suede boots and booties for the upcoming autumn season!\n\nSavvy\u2019s Recommended Pick: Booties, booties, and more (suede) booties!\n\nJust Plain #Relatable Items\n\nMotivated by cats and coffee. Not only is this totally true, it\u2019s one of the fashion brand\u2019s many #relatable items. An oversized sweatshirt that says \u201cSingle AF\u201d is more like it for us, though. You\u2019re bound to find something that was made for you because you\u2019ll read it and immediately think, \u201cnow that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget those convenient vinyl makeup pouches sparkling at you from in front of the check out counter. Remind everyone that \u201cI may not be perfect, but my makeup is,\u201d and above all else, \u201cI came, I saw, I contoured.\u201d\n\nGet it, girl.\n\nSavvy\u2019s Recommended Pick: Whatever speaks to your soul.\n\nAll photos were compiled from the official US Forever 21 website.
