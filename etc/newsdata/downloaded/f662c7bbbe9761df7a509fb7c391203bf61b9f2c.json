Chief Executive Officer David Dickson abruptly canceled a public appearance for the second time in two weeks as the energy-engineering company grapples with dwindling investor confidence.\n\nDickson was slated to deliver a presentation Thursday at the Gastech conference in Houston alongside peers from WorleyParsons Ltd. and TechnipFMC Plc. In his stead, McDermott COO Samik Mukherjee joined the panel, spokeswoman Gentry Brann said in an interview.\n\nThe shuffle comes amid a meltdown in McDermott\u2019s bonds and shares as the builder of oil platforms and natural gas plants struggles to cope with a $4.3 billion debt hangover from its 2018 purchase of Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. A person familiar with the matter said Wednesday that McDermott hired restructuring firm AlixPartners LLP for strategic and operational advice.\n\nMcDermott\u2019s stock has tumbled 72% since Monday\u2019s close.
