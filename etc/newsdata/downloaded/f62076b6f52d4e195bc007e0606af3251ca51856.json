The gruesome discovery has turned into one of Britain\u2019s largest homicide cases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFour people, including the driver of the truck, have been detained.\n\nA spokesman for the Vietnamese Embassy in London confirmed to The Washington Post that Tra My\u2019s family had contacted officials there over fears that she was among the dead.\n\nIn a separate statement, the embassy said three Vietnamese families had contacted its consular protection hotline for help verifying whether their relatives were among the victims. Embassy officials were communicating with British police and had requested a visit to Essex, where the truck was found.\n\nPolice had said Thursday that the victims were believed to be Chinese nationals, but in an update Friday, they cautioned that \u201cthe picture may change regarding identification\u201d as the investigation continues.\n\nAD\n\nAs that investigation progressed Friday, police arrested a man and a woman, both 38, from Warrington, England, and later in the day, a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland, whom they stopped at Stansted Airport. All three were held \u201con suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter.\u201d\n\nPolice also continued to question the 25-year-old driver of the refrigerated truck, who was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of murder.\n\nIn addition to determining the identities of the victims \u2014 eight women and 31 men \u2014 authorities are trying to figure out how they died and whether organized crime groups were involved. Postmortem examinations of 11 of the dead were due to start Friday afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExperts who follow human trafficking trends suggested that the Essex victims could have been compelled into forced labor. Or they could have been migrants who paid their way for the dangerous journey gone horribly wrong.\n\nTra My\u2019s brother, Pham Ngoc Tuan, told the BBC that his sister had paid 30,000 pounds ($39,000) to smugglers and that her last known whereabouts had been Belgium.\n\n\u201cMy sister went missing on 23 October on the way from Vietnam to the U.K., and we couldn\u2019t contact her. We are concerned she may be in that trailer,\u201d he said.\n\nEssex police and Belgian prosecutors said the refrigerated container arrived by sea from Zeebrugge, a Belgian port, and docked at Purfleet, a small port in Essex on the Thames, shortly after 12:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nPolice said the truck that picked up the container at Purfleet entered Britain separately, via ferry from Dublin, at Holyhead port in North Wales on Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nBritish media outlets, citing unnamed sources, reported that GPS tracking data showed the refrigerated container made its way from Dublin to Wales to Calais, France, on Oct. 16; moved between France and Belgium over several days; and then returned to Britain on Tuesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Global Trailer Rentals in Dublin confirmed to RTE News that it owned the container and said it had been rented out Oct. 15.\n\nPolice have not named the driver, although several British media outlets have identified him, citing sources in Northern Ireland, and posted photos from what were said to be his social media accounts. Several of his friends have defended him. Some suggested he could have been the one who called the ambulance services.\n\nAD\n\nBritish officials have previously warned that the route the container took across the North Sea was a launching point for \u201cclandestine arrivals\u201d into Britain. And National Crime Agency statistics show that Albanians and Vietnamese are the most common foreign nationals represented among those reported as victims of trafficking.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, 21 Vietnamese, including 11 children, were found alive in a refrigerated truck carrying sparkling water at the port of Newhaven, on England\u2019s south coast. The driver, a Romanian, was sentenced to six years in prison.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt the traffickers will have charged the group significant sums of money to reach the U.K.,\u201d the prosecutor in that case argued, \u201conly to put vulnerable children and young adults at risk of death.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "British police have arrested four people.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xONPaOHB0cOrwrEfGvW-KDQyahQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5SQNQYXXE4I6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
