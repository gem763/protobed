I played with Tevez in Manchester and Juventus , and what a player.\n\n\"He is a warrior and when we had him and Wayne up front, I was feeling sorry for the defenders.\"\n\nEvra selected Edin van der Sar in goal, with Dani Alves, Rio Ferdinand and Georginio Chiellini joining the Frenchman in a back four - omitting United legends Gary Neville and Nemanja Vidic.\n\nOf Neville, Evra said: \"I could have had Gary Neville, but Dani Alves is more talented!\"\n\n(Image: Sky Sports)\n\nJi-Sung Park was a surprise inclusion on the right-hand side of midfield, with Evra explaining: \"He was a solider.\n\n\"The 2008 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona , in both legs, he was man of the match. He didn't play the final after that but he is definitely one of my soldiers.\"\n\nA central midfield duo of Paul Scholes and Andrea Pirlo are in the engine room with Ryan Giggs unsurprisingly on the left flank.\n\nEvra also named James Milner as his toughest ever opponent, rather than Lionel Messi.\n\n\"He frustrated me because I\u2019m an attacking defender. I was like 'just go on attack,\" Evra explained.\n\n\"When I played the derby, I had him always up against me. Messi, I could deal with him.\"", "description": "The Frenchman left Manchester United's record goal scorer out of his fantasy XI of former teammates", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Sky Sports"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20671032.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Patrice-Evra.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
