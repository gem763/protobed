(MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nWhen William P. Barr was being confirmed as attorney general, some Democrats took solace in the idea that he was at least a mainstream Republican and not necessarily a Trump loyalist. In doing so, they overlooked past commentary that suggested he favored conspiracy theories involving the Clintons and the Russia investigation.\n\nWhen Barr appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to look into President Trump\u2019s allegations about the origins of that Russia probe, those same Democrats took solace in the fact that Durham had a reputation as a respected, nonpartisan straight shooter. In doing so, they set aside Barr\u2019s comments about the FBI having \u201cspied\u201d on Trump, along with Durham\u2019s past skepticism of the FBI\u2019s methods.\n\nIt\u2019s getting difficult for them to find solace in much of anything involving Barr.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Devlin Barrett, Shane Harris and Matt Zapotosky reported Monday that Barr has been traveling overseas to seek help from top allies for Durham\u2019s probe, visiting Britain and making multiple trips to Italy. The Trump administration has also made requests of Australia, whose officials played a key role in alerting U.S. officials to Russian interference. Signs indicate that the Aussies have proven a receptive audience.\n\nThe new disclosures recall last week\u2019s news that Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to launch two investigations that carried potential political benefits for him \u2014 including one involving the Russia probe\u2019s origins. Barr\u2019s Justice Department downgraded a whistleblower complaint about the matter to a point where it didn\u2019t need to be disclosed to Congress, even though the whistleblower said Barr \u201cappears to be involved.\" A rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president also showed Trump invoking Barr as someone he would connect the president with to facilitate the investigations. The Justice Department denied Barr did anything as described.\n\nThe new revelations are somewhat different than the Ukraine situation, though. It\u2019s one thing to lean on a country to launch its own probes; it\u2019s not quite the same thing to seek its cooperation with an American investigation.\n\nBut the news appears to fill out the picture of an attorney general who was suspicious of the Russia probe\u2019s origins from long before he took office, has honed his talking points about them in a very Trumpian direction, and now appears to be spending significant time pressing top allies to give the administration what it wants.\n\nJust because he\u2019s asking for it, of course, doesn\u2019t mean those allies will give him damning evidence to support his and Trump\u2019s suspicions. It\u2019s entirely possible that this will be handled aboveboard, with Durham asserting himself as the staid and reasonable prosecutor he is reputed to be.\n\nBut Barr\u2019s involvement portends all kind of uncertainty and lends itself to suspicion. The mere fact that he\u2019s apparently taking such an interest in this \u2014 to the extent that he has made repeated overseas trips \u2014 suggests this is a topic of significant concern for him. It perhaps indicates that it\u2019s not something he is pursuing just to mollify Trump and check a box for the president who appointed him.\n\nOf course, that shouldn\u2019t really be a surprise, given that Barr has been barking up this tree since 2017. Long before many Republicans were questioning the origins of the Russia investigation, Barr told the New York Times that there was more reason to investigate \u201cvarious \u2018national security\u2019 activities carried out during the election\u201d than there was to investigate potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. (He said the same of the Clinton Foundation and a debunked conspiracy theory involving the Clintons and Uranium One.)\n\nBarr told The Post around the same time, \u201cI don\u2019t think all this stuff about throwing [Clinton] in jail or jumping to the conclusion that she should be prosecuted is appropriate.\u201d Then he added: \u201cBut I do think that there are things that should be investigated that haven\u2019t been investigated.\u201d\n\nHe now appears to be facilitating one of those investigations \u2014 hard. The risk of such high-profile involvement from Barr is that top allies see him as applying pressure on behalf of Trump to get the answers Trump wants, rather than simply making sure they cooperate with the things Durham asks them to do. Barr is clearly not erring on the side of looking like he has completely outsourced this whole thing to Durham and is a passive player.\n\nTrump has frequently thrown his weight around on the world stage in efforts to get allies to do his bidding \u2014 most recently, we\u2019ve found out, in the case of Ukraine \u2014 and it\u2019s very difficult to separate this from that. The danger is that these countries that rely upon their alliance with the United States get the same message the whistleblower alleged Trump sent to Ukraine: They had better \u201cplay ball,\u201d or else.\n\nNone of it is a signal of an attorney general just checking a box and/or straining to avoid proving his detractors correct; it\u2019s a signal of an attorney general who has taken the kind of keen interest in this subject that his public comments should have made plainly obvious.", "description": "It\u2019s getting difficult for Democrats to find solace in much of anything involving Barr.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mV3fcTTGxBCdxLo-rqPCmWr_0yM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FAPH4GHDZQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
