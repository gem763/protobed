An angler captured the species in a private pond in Gwinnett County, northeast of Atlanta, prompting state officials to issue their recent warning to the public.\n\nThe fish looks innocuous enough, with a narrow, spotted body that can grow to about three feet. But the northern snakehead is a voracious predator that poses a major threat to fish, amphibians, crustaceans, and other native species, and can be aggressive when protecting young, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nThe snakehead spawns multiple times a year, with females laying as many as 100,000 eggs annually, so its takeover of ecosystems can be quick and devastating. The species has also evolved air-breathing respiratory organs that enable it to survive out of water for several days, giving it plenty of time to wriggle to nearby freshwater systems.\n\nThe fish first attracted major attention in the US in 2002, when a pond infestation was discovered in Crofton, Maryland. State officials poisoned the entire habitat and retrieved the carcasses of over 500 newborn snakeheads. The Crofton event inspired two Syfy movies released in 2004: Snakehead Terror and Frankenfish.\n\nGeorgia officials hope to stem the infestation of the species before it travels overland to other water bodies in the state.\n\n\u201cOur first line of defense in the fight against aquatic invasive species, such as the northern snakehead, are our anglers,\u201d said Matt Thomas, chief of fisheries for the Wildlife Resources Division, in a statement.\n\n\u201cThanks to the quick report by an angler, our staff was able to investigate and confirm the presence of this species in this water body,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are now taking steps to determine if they have spread from this water body and, hopefully, keep it from spreading to other Georgia waters.\u201d", "description": "The northern snakehead has now infested 15 states, and inspired two Syfy movies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9f8b7c05193d0009b95ec2/lede/1570737049804-Snakehead_-_Channa_argus_2.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
