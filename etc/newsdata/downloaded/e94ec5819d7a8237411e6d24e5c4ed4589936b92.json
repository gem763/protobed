Three victims already have contacted French authorities, the Paris prosecutor's office said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nEpstein, 66, died in August from what authorities have ruled a suicide by hanging in a federal jail in New York City. Epstein, a former friend of President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton, was being held without bail as he awaited trial in his case. His death remains under investigation by multiple agencies.\n\nOne of the documents released through MuckRock indicates that Epstein had no mental health concerns or suicidal tendencies at the time of his arrest in July.\n\nBut the Marshals Service detention report detailing Epstein's 33 days in custody at the Manhattan Correctional Center says he had \"mental concerns\" and \"suicidal tendencies\" during his incarceration.\n\nEpstein was found in late July on the floor of his cell with marks on his neck. He was placed on suicide watch for less than a week. Weeks later, he hanged himself, authorities have said.\n\nAn indictment issued in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York accused Epstein of sexually abusing dozens of minor girls from 2002 to 2005 at his massive townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side and at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nEpstein, who had pleaded not guilty in that case, had pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state charge of procuring a person under age 18 for prostitution. He served 13 months in custody for that earlier case and was required to register as a sex offender.", "description": "Months before Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on child sex trafficking charges, the former friend of President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton was being investigated for possibly failing to disclose his international travel as required for sex offenders.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106006716-1562589070765preview.jpg?v=1568220922", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
