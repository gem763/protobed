According to the New York Times, the source was instrumental in the conclusion by US intelligence agencies in 2016 that Mr Putin had personally orchestrated Russia's interference in the US presidential election.\n\nThe source's information was so sensitive that then-CIA director John Brennan prepared special sealed files for President Obama, rather than include it in the president's ordinary briefing, the Times report said.\n\nThe CIA - the intelligence agency said to have run the mole - declined to comment on the apparent revelations. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said CNN's reporting was \"not only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger\".\n\nThe CIA reportedly first tried to extract the mole soon after a now-infamous meeting between President Trump, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, at which Mr Trump was said to have shared classified operational details which could have exposed a US confidential source.\n\nOther officials present at the meeting reportedly realised the president's mistake and scrambled to inform the CIA and other intelligence agencies.\n\nBut the Russian mole reportedly refused the initial extraction attempt, citing family concerns - a move which threw the CIA into doubt abut the source's trustworthiness. Months later, the CIA tried again and the source agreed to be exfiltrated.\n\nThere was no suggestion that President Trump directly compromised the source in Russia, and reports said that widespread media speculation about US intelligence conclusions had contributed to the decision to extract the source.\n\nThere was rampant speculation again on Tuesday on social media as to the high-level's source's identity, as well as the connection between their extraction and the Trump administration's ties to Russian officials.\n\nThe source's whereabouts were likely a closely-guarded secret. Last year, Russian operatives travelled to England and used a nerve agent in an assassination attempt against a former Russian military intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, who had spied for the British.\n\nAnd in 2006, Russian operatives killed a former intelligence officer, Alexander Litvinenko, in central London by poisoning his tea with radioactive material, according to British investigators.", "description": "The mole had high-level Kremlin access but was pulled amid fears their cover could be blown, reports say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6190/production/_96067942_trump_lavrov976afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
