He says the Government's direct.gov.uk site, Citizens Advice and Age UK are good sources of information. You can find out more about free Government guidance sessions on pensions here. This is Money has a guide to the benefits over-65s might qualify for here.\n\nLowe adds: 'The poorest 20 per cent of pensioners receive far less in housing benefit than others which strongly suggests they are much more likely to own their homes than rent them.\n\n'From our own research into benefits we know that pensioner homeowners are less likely than the average pensioner to claim other benefits such as pension credit and council tax support so we think many might assume that the fact they have wealth tied up in the home rules them out of claiming benefits even if they are struggling.\n\n'Our annual benefits research reveals high numbers losing out on thousands of pounds in benefits a year.'\n\nLowe points to previous research by Just Group that found 52 per cent of homeowners aged over 65 have never checked their entitlement to benefits other than the state pension, compared to 20 per cent of renters.\n\nThe firm also revealed earlier this year that many elderly people who approach it about squeezing cash from their properties through equity release were unaware of being entitled to thousands of pounds in state benefits.\n\nSome 42 per cent were unwittingly missing out on any state help, and a further 19 per cent were receiving some benefits but not others. In one of the most serious cases, a 64-year-old in Norfolk was losing \u00a37,142 a year.\n\nJust Group singled out pension credit, which tops up the weekly income of the poorest elderly people in the country, as the most important unclaimed benefit.\n\nPeople may be eligible if they have reached state pension age, even if they own their home. The Government has reportedly seen a surge in applications since the BBC announced it would means test over-75s for free TV licences, based on whether they receive pension credit, from next summer.
