I'm Alexei Oreskovic, Business Insider's West Coast Bureau Chief and Global Tech Editor.\n\nThis week: Computer school has gotten cool\n\nComputer programming was once an unglamorous practice. At least, that's how it seemed to me as an incurious middle school student many years ago, pecking away in computer class on a TRS-80 and struggling to learn BASIC. It was tough to see how that kind of drudgery could make anyone's life better \u2014 at least, beyond the brief thrill that came from making an obscene word scroll across a classmate's monochrome screen.\n\nBut today, knowing how to code is a sexy superpower; it's the special skill that can land you a job at Apple or Google. A variety of coding schools and boot camps have sprouted up to let anyone achieve the dream.\n\nAusten Allred, CEO and co-founder of Lambda School Lambda School\n\nLambda School, based in San Francisco, is one of the most popular. In just nine months, the school promises to turn you into a programming rock star, fit to wear a Google badge on your belt and to ride a fancy shuttle to work everyday. And best of all, it doesn't cost any money upfront. You pay after you get a job.\n\nAs Rosalie Chan reports, however, not everyone who goes to Lambda leaves singing its praises. Some students complain that Lambda suffers from unqualified instructors, an incomplete curriculum and a cult-like atmosphere in which any criticism of the program is not tolerated.\n\nIf you're not yet a subscriber to Trending, BI Prime's tech newsletter, you can sign up here.\n\n\"Lambda School is not worth the life it takes from you, and it's not worth the dollar amount you agree to pay them back,\" one former student told Rosalie.\n\nThe school defends its record, stressing that its income sharing payment model has opened up access to education for students of all walks of life. For some students, that's probably true. But based on Rosalie's report, I get the sense that some alumni have a message for Lambda they'd like to make scroll across a screen.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nLambda School is Silicon Valley's big bet on reinventing education and making student debt obsolete. But students say it's a 'cult' and they would have been better off learning on their own.\n\nStartup founders and startup investors are going through changes\n\nA few inquiring minds have asked why we chose the title Founder Frenemies for our special report on the state of affairs in Silicon Valley's startup scene.\n\nYes, it's a play on the term \"Founder Friendly,\" which has been the law of the land in Silicon Valley for years. The evolution of this amicable arrangement between VCs and founders is, as we report, a vital force that will reshape the tech industry in the years ahead.\n\nThe relationship between tech entrepreneurs and VC investors is become more strained; the diverging nature of their interests more exposed. And that means changes in everything from IPO plans to startup share structures.\n\nRead all the stories in the special report here:\n\nIPO flops and CEO firings have made it clear that Silicon Valley's magic startup formula is about to change: Welcome to the age of Founder Frenemies\n\nHelp wanted: Oracle CEO\n\nIt's one of the most high-profile jobs in Silicon Valley. And probably one of the toughest.\n\nThe CEO of Oracle must not only split duties with a co-CEO, they also need be comfortable with founder and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison looking over their shoulder.\n\nWith one of the co-CEO jobs vacant, following Mark Hurd's medical leave, speculation is rife about who will get elevated to Oracle's top tier. Benjamin Pimentel has the info on the 5 candidates believed to be on Larry's short list.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nMeet the 5 execs that Larry Ellison and insiders say are on the short list to one day be the CEO of Oracle\n\nOther recent tech highlights:\n\nAnd more from across the BI newsroom:\n\nAs always, I'm eager for your feedback, thoughts, and tips \u2014 you can email me at aoreskovic@businessinsider.com.
