Those in the top 40% by income were more likely than those in the bottom 60% to still be alive in 2014, ranging from 74 to 83 in age, the GAO concluded.\n\nThe findings suggest a statistical correlation between wealth and a longer life, but doesn't conclusively prove that having less money means an earlier demise. Still, the report jibes with other research that links wealth and life expectancy. A 2016 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found the richest 1% of women live more than a decade longer than the poorest 1% of women.\n\nRay Dalio says wealth inequality is a national emergency\n\n\"Poverty is a life-threatening issue for millions of people in this country, and this report confirms it,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, who commissioned the GAO report after meeting with residents of McDowell County, West Virginia, in a news release.\n\nAverage life expectancy for men in McDowell County is a national low of 64 years. Conversely, 350 miles away, in well-off Fairfax County, Virginia, men live to be an average of 82, the Vermont independent said.\n\nThe GAO also pointed to the widening wealth gap between the richest Americans and other affluent people. Those in the top 1% increased their average wealth from $15 million in 1989 to $37 million in 2016. By comparison, average income for the remainder of the top 20% increased from $1.6 million to $3 million.", "description": "Poverty a \"life-threatening issue for millions of people,\" Sen.
