Each serves a vital role in sustaining our republic, a nation established on the idea that the government exists to serve the people\u2014not the other way around. In a time when despots ruled much of the world, our founders chose to believe that the people could govern themselves prudently, without destroying the civil liberties their ancestors had won, and without subjecting political minorities to arbitrary power. It was a revolutionary idea. So much so that when the Constitutional Convention proposed ordaining the Constitution in the name of \u201cWe the People,\u201d Patrick Henry objected. Who was it, he asked, that \u201cauthorized them to speak the language of \u2018We the People,\u2019 instead of \u2018We the States\u2019?\u201d Madison replied that \u201c[t]he existing system has been derived from the . . . authority of the legislatures of the states; whereas, this is derived from the superior power of the people\u201d themselves.\n\nMany across the world thought this bold experiment in self-government was bound to fail, and the founders themselves recognized it would hardly prove self-perpetuating. They knew the cold truth that keeping a republic depends on certain very special conditions. And maybe highest on the list is that the people themselves know how their government works and are able and willing to participate in its administration. Monarchies and oligarchies have no need for widespread civic education. A ruling elite can learn the business of government from their predecessors easily enough. But in our republic the ruling class is supposed to be the whole of the American people. And for us to govern ourselves wisely, every generation has to learn the business of government and what values our republic was designed to serve and then commit themselves to participating in its operation. Even before the Constitution was created, the Northwest Ordinance declared that \u201c[r]eligion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\u201d For us, civic education and engagement are not just ideals; they are indispensable. As Jefferson put it, \u201cIf a nation expects to be ignorant and free . . . it expects what never was and never will be.\u201d\n\nSome of this is pretty self-evident. You need to know about politicians, their views, and how they compare with others in order to elect representatives who will speak for you. You need to know, as well, about your rights in order to enforce them. You\u2019re more likely to speak your mind freely if you know that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech. You\u2019re more likely to protest the police rifling through your papers if you know the government cannot con- duct unreasonable searches. You\u2019re more likely to worship as you choose if you know your prayers are protected against government interference.\n\nBut if we are to be a self-governing people, we need to know not just our rights but the structures that protect them. Our government is one of limited and separated powers, a design deliberately chosen to secure the promise of self-rule and our liberties and to prevent the accumulation of power in too few hands. Yet, according to Annenberg, today it seems only about a quarter of Americans can name the three branches of government. Approximately a third cannot name any branch. Many do not know why the founders established this separation of powers or how it protects their liberties. Civic education is no longer a central part of the curriculum in many of our public schools.", "description": "Editor's Note:\u00a0The following is excerpted from \"A Republic, If You .10/02/2019 12:55:00PM EST.", "authors": ["Justice Neil Gorsuch", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/townhall/reu/o/2018/334/49088584-f305-4464-8c5e-a14b51fa93e8.png"}
