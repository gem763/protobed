Michael Brantley followed up with a single of his own, putting runners on the corners with no outs.\n\nJose Altuve then lined a single to right field to score Springer and keep runners on the corners.\n\nAlex Bregman\u2019s double scored both Brantley and Altuve with a double to right-center, and Yuli Gurriel\u2019s hit scored Bregman.\n\nThe Rays, who had won two straight to force a deciding game five, pulled a run back with Eric Sogard\u2019s homer off Cole in the second inning.\n\nBut the Rays couldn\u2019t make any more headway and Brantley and Altuve delivered back-to-back home runs in the eighth to complete the scoring.\n\nHouston reached the ALCS for the third straight year as they seek another World Series title to go with the one they captured in 2017.\n\nThey lost to eventual World Champions Boston in the ALCS last year.\n\nThe Yankees, who swept the Minnesota Twins in three games in their division series, are in pursuit of a record-extending 28th World Series crown.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Houston pitcher Gerrit Cole tossed a post-season gem and the Astros offense exploded early to beat the Tampa Bay Rays 6-1 on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/192d11_houston-pitcher-gerrit-cole-pitched-strong-innings-in-astros-win-tampa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
