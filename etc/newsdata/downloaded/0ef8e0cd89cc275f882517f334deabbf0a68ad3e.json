In his predecessor\u2019s deal the backstop was a transitional agreement to basically insure the Irish border remained free flowing even if the Eu and the UK ran into difficultly negotiating a trade deal later on. In this new deal - what\u2019s agreed is a final position. So what is it?\n\nNumber 1\n\nNorthern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of EU rules. Notably related to goods. Michel Barnier\n\nWhat they\u2019ve decided is that goods entering Northern Ireland will be checked like any goods entering the UK. And there won\u2019t be checks for goods crossing the border. Any border infrastructure was considered to be in breach of the Good Friday Peace agreement. The next point is on duties which you have to pay when taking good across borders.\n\nNumber 2\n\nNorthern Ireland will remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory. It will therefore benefit from the UK\u2019s future trade policy. But Northern Ireland will also remain an entry point into our single market. Michel Barnier\n\nAnd to deal with that, Northern Ireland will have to charge business duties that are importing goods onto their territory which are destined to end up in the European Union. This means there doesn\u2019t need to be checks across the border.\"\n\nNumber 3\n\nThis night and this morning also, we were working on the issue of VAT. Michel Barnier\n\nAnd the explanation to that was essentially it\u2019s resolved. It appears that Northern Ireland will need to enforce EU VAT but that the UK will collect that tax. This means Northern Ireland will essential remains under the EU\u2019s rules on this aspect. Something unpalatable to the Democratic Unionist Party.\"\n\nNumber 4\n\nFour years after the entering into force of the protocol, the elected representatives of Northern Ireland will be able to decide whether to continue applying relevant union rules in Northern Ireland or not. Michel Barnier\n\nSo this is a vote where member of the Northern Irish assembly will get to vote on whether to keep the whole thing going or not. But the vote is by qualified majority and not, like in many votes in the assembly, by full communities consent. And the DUP party which props up Boris Johnson\u2019s Tory government were insisting on that so they could veto any decision. This deal now has to be passed by MPs in Westminster - if it\u2019s not, there\u2019s very little appetite here in Brussels or around EU capitals to renegotiate further.", "description": "Johnson's deal explained", "authors": ["Jack Parrock", "Michel Barnier"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/19/30/1000x563_cmsv2_15af8e44-3841-5523-83bc-7609364458be-4241930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
