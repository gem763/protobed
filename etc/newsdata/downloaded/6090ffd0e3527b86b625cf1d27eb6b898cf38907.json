The police department for its part says the policy is about avoiding the appearance of political bias.\n\nBut the person who could be most irked by the rule change? The president, who is traveling to Minneapolis Thursday for his first campaign rally since House Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nImpeachment inquiry: Here is what will happen this week\n\nTrump often surrounds himself with men and women in uniform, both in the White House and on the campaign trail. He has has long painted himself as a pro-law enforcement president, ranging from his sharp criticism of NFL player protests during the national anthem over police brutality to the Department of Justice's slowed pace of civil rights investigations into local police departments.\n\nIn February at the Major County Sheriffs and the Major Cities Chiefs Association Joint Conference, he renewed his commitment to law enforcement, vowing to make \"officer safety a top priority.\"\n\n\"In my administration, we understand that reducing crime begins with respecting law enforcement. We will not tolerate smears, or slanders, or assaults on those who wear the badge and police our streets,\" he said.\n\nAnd that support appears to be reciprocal. He earned the endorsement of the National Fraternal Order of Police, which claims more than 330,000 members, in 2016. And the International Union of Police Associations (IUPA) has already endorsed him in his 2020 re-election bid.\n\nWe love our Law Enforcement Officers all around this great Country. What took place in NYC with water being tossed on NYPD officers was a total disgrace. It is time for @NYCMayor @BilldeBlasio to STAND UP for those who protect our lives and serve us all so well... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2019\n\nBut instead of the thin blue line appearing behind Trump on Thursday, there will be \"a sea red T-shirts,\" according to Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis. The shirt features the phrase \"Cops for Trump\" emblazoned across an American flag in the shape of Minnesota and will be sold both online and at the rally. All proceeds from the shirt sales will go to the union's charity, Kroll said.\n\nHow we got here\n\nThe T-shirt sale follows furor over a new Minneapolis Police Department policy that prohibits off-duty officers from wearing their uniform to political events.\n\nThe policy, according to police spokesman John Elder, is to prevent officers from showing political bias.\n\n\"The uniform gets translated back to the average person as someone being from the police department,\" he said. \"It's very confusing for people when they see someone in uniform to understand the difference between the city and the federation.\"\n\nA T-shirt designed by the Minneapolis Police Federation reads More\n\nBut Kroll thinks politics are behind the rule change and said he was not surprised when the police chief called him to inform him of the new policy. He pointed to comments made by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey following the announcement of the Trump rally, in which Frey said Trump's \"message of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\"", "description": "The policy change came the day after Trump announced he would host a rally in Minneapolis, and the head of the local police union argues it was meant to favor the city's Democratic officials.", "authors": ["Courtney Subramanian", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nWdI1vIS_dzBDewZkUZSnA--~B/aD0yMDE1O3c9MTgxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/31e7d9946e67afe3be6b72bcb64600fa", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
