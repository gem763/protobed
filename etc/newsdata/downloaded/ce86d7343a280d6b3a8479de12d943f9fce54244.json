It is holding a board meeting over the weekend to evaluate its position.\n\n\u201cWe have not given up,\u201d the person said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nThe Transport Salaried Staffs Association, which represents Thomas Cook staff, appealed to the government to step in with \u201creal financial support\u201d.\n\nManuel Cortes, the group\u2019s general secretary, wrote to the government calling on it to \u201cact if required and save this iconic cornerstone of the British high street and the thousands of jobs that go with it.\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThomas Cook can be a highly successful business and must be given every opportunity to flourish. I urge you to stand ready to assist Thomas Cook with real financial support.\n\n\u201cThe company must be rescued no matter what. No British government in its right mind would countenance the loss of so many jobs and the prospect of just one major travel operator \u2013 TUI \u2013 controlling the mass market.\u201d\n\nRebecca Long-Bailey, the main opposition Labour Party\u2019s business policy adviser, said the situation was \u201cyet more evidence of this government\u2019s indifference to British jobs and businesses going under.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll viable options must be explored by Thomas Cook and the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis.\u201d\n\nWere Thomas Cook to fail to find the funds it requires, it could be put into administration, a form of creditor protection that often precedes bankruptcy.\n\nThat would spark the largest peacetime repatriation in British history with some 160,000 Britons currently enjoying Thomas Cook holidays in destinations including California, the Caribbean and Corfu.\n\nIn total, some 600,000 holidaymakers from markets including Germany and Scandinavia could be stranded. The company\u2019s social media channels are full of customers asking if they will be able to get home.\n\nThe British government and the airline regulator have already drawn up plans in case they need to step in to bring customers home. But the fallout from any collapse would go far beyond the interrupted holidays of its customers.\n\nFounded in 1841 with a local rail excursion in Britain, the company now runs hotels and resorts, airlines, cruises and hundreds of high street travel agent stores. With 21,000 staff, it operates in 16 countries and serves 19 million customers a year.\n\nIts demise could affect the economies of its big holiday markets in Spain, Greece and Turkey, its shareholders and lending banks, and the landlords of its many high street stores.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Thomas Cook logo is seen in this illustration photo January 22, 2018.
