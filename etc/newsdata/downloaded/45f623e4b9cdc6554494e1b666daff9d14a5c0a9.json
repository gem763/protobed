Burger chain White Castle cooked up morning sandwiches of its own in 2011.\n\nTaco Bell jumped into the breakfast fray in 2014, just before breakfast visits peaked two years after, according to data collected by market research firm NPD Group, Inc. More specifically, in the past five years, breakfast visits at fast food restaurants have grown 7.7 percent with a spending increase of 31 percent.\n\nLikewise breakfast visits went up 1 percent in the past year while lunch and dinner dropped by nearly the same rate, according to NPD Group\u2019s numbers.\n\nThe research firm also alleged that morning meal traffic has increased due to customers seeking low cost and portable breakfast options that are convenient to their lifestyle.\n\n\u201cI think if I had more time, I would love to eat more meals at home. But, I\u2019m kind of like anyone else, I\u2019m on the go and don\u2019t necessarily have enough time to make something and just want to grab something quickly,\u201d Adam Chandler, author of Drive-Thru Dreams: A Journey Through the Heart of America\u2019s Fast-Food Kingdom told FOX Business.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s easy for me to grab a bacon egg and cheese from a cart, and in other places if you\u2019re driving, fast food makes all the sense in the world.\u201d\n\nNot having to worry about dishes or stocked fridges are added bonuses Chandler cited aside from affordability.\n\nFrom an industry standpoint, the ingredients for a breakfast menu are low cost, but the implementation is expensive.\n\n\u201cThere is an increase in labor, management and operations, so for a chain to add this daypart, they have to be committed as it involves capital investment,\u201d John Howeth, senior vice president of market development at American Egg Board explained to FOX Business. \u201cOne thought comes to mind, foodservice operators already have the building and the land, so why not add a new segment if it fits your corporate goals and customers\u2019 expectations.\u201d\n\nWendy\u2019s on the other hand is joining the fast food fight in 2020 after failing to capture the breakfast market with its three previous attempts \u2013 and this time with a $20 million investment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely confident this is going to work,\u201d Wendy\u2019s CEO Todd Penegor told investors during the Oct. 11 Investor Day presentation.\n\nUnlike its first few tries at the breakfast game, Wendy\u2019s has dedicated two years of development that included input from executives, members of the board and franchisees.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have scale behind it,\u201d Kurt Kane, the burger chain\u2019s CCO and U.S. president said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ll put full media power behind the breakfast,\u201d he added regarding Wendy\u2019s dedication to building nationwide breakfast sales.\n\nAccording to KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Eric Gonzalez, however, it might be too late to make a meaningful dent in the fast food breakfast market. The early announcement may also give competitors a chance to create a counter attack.\n\n\u201cWe expect an onslaught of discounting from other chains that have greater scale, established customer bases and a lot to lose,\u201d Gonzalez told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd it appears that Wendy\u2019s main rivals, McDonald\u2019s and Burger King really are prepping for the redheaded logo donning chain\u2019s 6,000 store-wide launch.\n\nLast quarter, McDonald\u2019s said breakfast sales rose, but were weaker than lunch and dinner. Despite this, recent promotions for apple wood smoked bacon, Donut Sticks and an updated McCaf\u00e9 menu aim to keep McDonald\u2019s competitive.\n\nBurger King\u2019s parent company Restaurant Brands International Inc. told investors earlier this year that will try to make breakfast 15 percent of its total sales.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nOutside of the burger-focused franchises that are trying to dominate breakfast, countless other fast food joints are using Americans love for protein and sandwiches to lure consumers in.\n\nNPD Group surveys revealed that U.S. dietary trends are leading breakfast eaters away from cereal and toward quick-service egg and meat sandwiches.\n\n\u201cCereal has been propped up as healthy for a really long time, and I think between studies on sugar and food trends against gluten have kind of put a big dent in that kind of sensibility,\u201d Chandler said regarding the shift from at-home breakfast to fast food.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s kind of the protein aspect. A lot of people are vegetarian and are moving away from meat, so eggs are really a quick-fix,\u201d Chandler pointed out.\n\nHe cited the Egg McMuffin was a big deal for vegetarians when it was added to McDonald\u2019s all-day breakfast menu. Additionally, he found in his research that McDonald\u2019s serves nearly 5 percent of all eggs produced in the U.S. to feed breakfast enthusiasts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAside from a high demand of eggs, protein from meat fits the diets of Americans well, according to Chandler.\n\n\u201cThe sandwich is sort of the quintessential breakfast meal because we are such an on the go, pressed for time people. We sort of have it in our national credo to always push to get things done, to make the most of your time and succeed at all costs, and think that speaks to why we want food to be portable,\u201d he explained.\n\nMoreover, fast food chains are keen to the cultural significance of the sandwich and have opted for over-the-top or sugary menu items to get the people\u2019s attention. Last month, KFC began testing Chicken & Donuts after the Popeye\u2019s chicken sandwich craze. Texas chain Whataburger has mastered the art of sweet and savory breakfast with its Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit \u2013 a menu item Wendy\u2019s is happily adding to its breakfast rollout.", "description": "The fast food war is heating up with breakfast options available in more establishments than ever.
