The attorney general was already been reported to have been surprised and angry that the president told Volodymyr Zelensky on the call to work with him on further investigation.\n\nNow there\u2019s a new country involved: The New York Times reported yesterday that Trump \u201cpushed the Australian prime minister during a recent telephone call to help Attorney General William P. Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Mr. Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation, according to two American officials with knowledge of the call.\u201d (An Australian diplomat had discussed Russia and Hillary with since-convicted Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos.) The AG also met with Italian officials last week.\n\nBarr is, therefore, a crucial partner as Trump uses \u201cfederal law enforcement powers to aid his political prospects, settle scores with his perceived \u2018deep state\u2019 enemies and show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt, partisan origins,\u201d says the Times.\n\nStill, there\u2019s video of Trump saying he wanted Barr to aid in the probe of the origins of the Russia investigation, so this was not a state secret.\n\nThe third major player now is Rudy Giuliani, who is taking issue with House subpoenas \u201csigned only by Democrat Chairs.\u201d (That is routine, as it was when Republican House chairmen signed subpoenas during the Benghazi probe.)\n\nGiuliani, of course, has been a near-daily presence on television, defending his role in privately meeting with Ukrainian officials and doggedly trying to shift the spotlight to allegations of wrongdoing by Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nGiuliani\u2019s combative interviews prompted the Biden campaign to ask the networks to stop putting him on and allowing him to spew lies. This was a Hail Mary pass that would obviously be swatted down, and an effort to generate some anti-Rudy headlines.\n\nNot only would no network let a campaign dictate its bookings, but numerous anchors have aggressively challenged Giuliani on the air. In fact, some Democrats like Rudy on television because they think his sometimes heated style hurts Trump.\n\nIn a separate story, the Journal reports that Barr at times has been critical of Giuliani\u2019s efforts, and that Trump, while appreciating his TV combat role, has occasionally mocked his personal lawyer.\n\nOf course, there are also Democrats who have been given starring roles in the impeachment drama. One is Nancy Pelosi, who was just on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d and has been saying she\u2019s \u201csad\u201d and \u201cheartbroken\u201d over impeachment in an attempt to tone down the rhetoric.\n\nAnother is Adam Schiff, the House Intel chairman, who made the mistake of exaggerating Trump\u2019s Ukraine call in a hearing during what he now calls mockery. Trump has repeatedly questioned on Twitter why Schiff hasn\u2019t been questioned for fraud and treason. (Treason?)\n\nAnd, of course, the Bidens. Tucker Carlson\u2019s show obtained a 2014 photo of the then-vice president and his son playing golf in the Hamptons with a board member of the Ukrainian gas giant that employed Hunter Biden. This obviously raises questions about Joe Biden\u2019s contention that he did nothing to help his son in Ukraine and that they never discussed the matter.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the unknown whistle-blower, who Trump has accused of sparking a \u201cDemocratic hoax\u201d and whose lawyer says his life may be in jeopardy.\n\nBy setting their sights on two Trump Cabinet members and his lawyer, House Democrats have given themselves more targets. But they also risk muddying the narrative and allowing these Trump confidants to delay the investigation into next year\u2019s campaign.", "description": "President Trump, now sounding a cautionary note about \u201ccivil war,\u201d is obviously at the white-hot center of the impeachment drama, just as he\u2019s been at the center of American political and cultural warfare for four years.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/01/694940094001_6091039872001_6091036612001-vs.jpg"}
