The first time I played one was at a friend\u2019s house (with a few beers and crisps) and Super Mario World just blew me away. It was so good that I knew I had to have one and used a sizable chunk of my student loan to buy one the next morning as soon as the shop opened. My parents were not impressed.\n\nI always liked the look of the SNES compared to the Mega Drive, although I never quite understood why the American version was so ugly. I thought it always looked quite understated in comparison to its bolder more aggressive-looking rival. The SNES pads were a joy to use and a big leap forward compared to the NES and Master System controllers. I still enjoy the look, feel and functionality they offer today via the Mini SNES.\n\nI\u2019m also considering ordering one for my Nintendo Switch once they are available again. The L/R shoulder buttons really came into their own with the likes of F-Zero for braking, diagonal firing for Contra III: Alien Wars/Super Probotector, and of course the various version of Street Fighter II. The controller configuration also meant SNES owners were treated to a very playable version of Super Smash T.V.\n\nI definitely bought more games for the SNES than the Mega Drive. I preferred the SNES games and publishers were doing things with the SNES that the Mega Drive just couldn\u2019t do. It was an exciting time to be a gamer and there was no shortage of games. Although Capcom and Konami supported both consoles most of their SNES games were of a very high quality and a lot of these titles still hold up well today. There were obviously some great games for Sega\u2019s machine which I enjoyed, like Streets Of Rage, Strider, Golden Axe, and plenty of other arcade conversions which the SNES didn\u2019t get but my console of choice was always the SNES.\n\nI have to admit to playing the original Sonic the Hedgehog more in recent years than playing Super Mario World. Sometimes it\u2019s just fun to have a quick run through the Green Hill Zone and I usually end up playing much further into the game. Super Mario World might be a technically better and longer game but for a quick retro blast Sonic beats it hand down.\n\nI have a Mini SNES and will now be getting the Mega Drive Mini for Christmas. I\u2019m looking forward to playing Sega\u2019s machine and some of the rarer games but for me a lot of the SNES games hold up well in terms of gameplay, if not necessary graphics. I personally still find the original F-Zero very playable but this was not the view of a recent GC contributor who was not so keen. I guess some things don\u2019t change and everybody has their own preference. Mine just happens to be the SNES and the games that it afforded me the chance to play.\n\nBADMAFiA72", "description": "GameCentral readers debate the fiercest rivalry in all gaming and ask what\u2019s better, the Super Nintendo or the Mega Drive?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/148444_ncm_snes_illustration_1570842191.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
