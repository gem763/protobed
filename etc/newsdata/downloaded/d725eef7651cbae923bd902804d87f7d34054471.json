It is currently too risky to go inside the vessel to search for the missing, Coast Guard officials said at a press conference Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe missing crew members' last known location was the engine room, but they could be elsewhere on the ship by now, U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Lloyd Heflin told ABC News. The entire crew is from South Korea, Heflin said.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard\n\nOnce the vessel has been determined to be stable, rescue crews will carve out a plan for the best way to enter the ship, officials said.\n\nThe cargo ship is currently \"listing heavily\" on the sound, according to the Coast Guard.
