And I've said consistently when no deal is off the table we will back an election.\n\n\"Today, after much denial and much bluster by the Prime Minister, that deal is officially off the table. So this country can vote for the Government that it deserves.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAsked about the public holiday proposal, Mr Corbyn replied: \"I agree that a public holiday on election day would actually be a very good idea because it does mean that everyone could then get along to vote without the problems of being at work at that time.\n\n\"It is something that has been discussed before.\"\n\nHe added: \"All 16-year-olds should have the right to vote because it seems to me fundamental to our democracy. It's young people's future after all that we will be debating in this election.\"\n\nClosing his speech, Mr Corbyn went on: \"Whatever date the House decides the election will be, I'm ready for it, we're ready for it.\"\n\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the SNP welcomes the opportunity of an election which will allow Scotland to \"determine its own future\".\n\n(Image: JESSICA TAYLOR/UK PARLIAMENT HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nHe said: \"We on these benches are simply not prepared to sit back and allow Scotland to be taken out of the European Union against its will.\n\n\"So on that basis, Mr Speaker, I welcome the opportunity of an election, because make no mistake, the election that's coming is going to be the right of Scotland to determine its own future.\"\n\nMr Blackford also said his party wants the election age reduced to 16 for all polls and for the franchise to be extended to EU nationals living in the UK.\n\nHe said: \"I expect the Government today to look positively on any amendments that come forward for EU nationals - there is nothing for the Government to fear by extending the franchise.\"\n\nHe said EU nationals are already on the electoral register as they are allowed to vote in local elections.", "description": "The Labour leader said it would mean \"everyone could then get along to vote without the problems of being at work at that time\"", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Garry F Mcharg Daily Record", "Pa", "Jessica Taylor Uk Parliament Handout Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752134.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0__GFMP_SDR_271019-Jeremy-Corbyn-Blantyre-016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
