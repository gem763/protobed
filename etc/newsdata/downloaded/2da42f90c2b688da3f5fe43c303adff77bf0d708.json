He has sided repeatedly with the large corporate interest against the working people.\"\n\nThe client list that Scalia provided to the Office of Government Ethics last month included some of America\u2019s most powerful corporations, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Ford, Facebook, Delta Air Lines, Marriott and Juul Labs.\n\nScalia said he would not participate for one year in any decision that could affect a former client without first obtaining a written waiver, raising the prospect that he may have to recuse himself from key Trump administration policy initiatives such as DOL's highly anticipated joint employer proposal.\n\nThe American Hotel and Lodging Association, which represents Marriott, submitted comments supporting the proposed rule. Another group Scalia provided legal services for, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, also supported the joint employer proposal in public comments.\n\nBut Republicans and business groups say Scalia's legal career in labor and employment law makes him \"well qualified\" to lead the agency.\n\n\"It is important for the Department of Labor to create an environment to help employers and employees succeed in today\u2019s rapidly changing workplace,\" Senate HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said in a floor speech Wednesday, according to his prepared remarks.\n\nThe nomination could become a political liability for Trump in 2020, Democrats and union leaders suggested. The president won more votes in union households in 2016 than any Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan, but AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka warned on a press call Thursday morning that Scalia's nomination is \"insulting, it's dangerous and workers are not going to forget it.\u201d\n\n\"My guess is if every working person knew Mr. Scalia's record,\" Schumer said during the same press call, \"and that President Trump nominated him, Mr. Trump would hardly get the vote of a worker.\"\n\nScalia previously served as chief legal officer for the Labor Department during the George W. Bush administration, a position he took following a recess appointment by the former Republican president.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Scalia dodged pointed questions on his policy views, but suggested he wouldn't let the interests of former clients influence his public role.\n\n\u201cWhen I was at the Labor Department before,\u201d Scalia said, \u201cI was ever mindful that I had a new set of responsibilities and even a higher set of responsibilities. The most important thing to me as a practitioner has been fidelity to my obligations and to the law.\"\n\nIan Kullgren contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/76/a8/6c23144c47659c284ee8c1d4c2b1/190926-eugene-scalia-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
