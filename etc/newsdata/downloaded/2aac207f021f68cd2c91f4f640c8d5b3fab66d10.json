We have some on-trend suggestions here from a leading interior design expert.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to MailOnline Property, Sophie Robinson - who is a regular designer on BBC's DIY SOS and a former judge on The Great Interior Designer Challenge - picked four winning hues to commemorate New Homes Week.\n\nThe colours are from a range of paint suppliers, including Farrow & Ball, Little Green, and Valspar.\n\nInterior design Sophie Robinson picks four paint colours to use in a new home\n\nSophie said: 'New homes tend to be painted bright white as a blank canvas.\n\n'But pure white is a design crime as it is too bright in south-facing rooms and too depressing in north-facing rooms.\n\n'You need to get your paint brush out. It can be over-whelming but you have to do it.'\n\nThe paint colour Bone China Blue by Little Greene is perfect for calm spaces (stock image)\n\nShe outlined three steps to help decide what paint colours to use in your new home.\n\nThese are looking at the feel of the room you want to create, how you use that room and when you use the room.\n\nShe said: 'When I design a room, I need to know whether it is a calm or sociable and energetic area. So a kitchen would have a different feel to a bedroom.\n\n'How and when you use the room is also important. So you may only use a room only in the evening - such as a master bedroom. I have painted my own bedroom dark blue. And my kitchen, which is north facing, a dark green.'\n\nThe paint colour Puttin' on the Ritz by Valspar is good for dramatic spaces (stock picture)\n\nThe colour she selected for a calm room in a new build home is Bone China Blue by Little Green.\n\nShe selected Setting Plaster by Farrow & Ball for cosy rooms and Painted Quince by Fired Earth for an uplifting feel.\n\nTo help create a dramatic feel to a room, she recommended Puttin' on the Ritz by Valspar.\n\nThe paint colour Setting Plaster by Farrow & Ball is appropriate for cosy rooms (stock photo)\n\nSOPHIE'S SELECTION Sophie Robinson's has picked these four paint colours depending on the feel of the room you want to create: Calming: Bone China Blue by Little Greene Cosy: Setting Plaster by Farrow and Ball Uplifting: Painted Quince by Fired Earth Dramatic: Puttin' on the Ritz by Valspar\n\nSophie's recommendations follow a Home Builders Federation survey of 2,055 people by Deltapoll earlier this year, which found that the average spend on improvements when moving home is more than \u00a313,000.\n\nClaire Coward, of the Home Builders Federation, said: 'The blank canvas of a new home and the perfectly plastered, brand new walls make decorating a doddle.\n\n'The average spend on improvements when moving home is \u00a313,472, but with a new build you can just grab a paint brush and add your style for minimum outlay.\n\n'Simply experiment with Sophie's suggested colours and watch the space transform,' she added.\n\nThe colour Painted Quince by Fired Earth can help to give a room an uplifting feel\n\nWhile many new builds might come with uninspired decor, they do have several other attractions to homebuyers, according to research published this week by property website Zoopla.\n\nA total of 2,000 respondents listed new builds being built to a high quality, energy efficient and their 10-year warranty as some of their most desirable features.\n\nZoopla's Laura Howard said: 'One of the main draws of was a high-quality build, which would reduce property-related costs and stresses further down the line.\n\n'Energy-efficiency was the second biggest draw of a new-build, perhaps tapping into a growing sense of environmental awareness and, of course, also generally costing less in household bills.'", "description": "The colours are from a range of paint suppliers, including Farrow & Ball, Little Green, and Valspar.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/16/16/13582276-0-image-a-56_1558020424858.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-17"}
