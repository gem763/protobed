Photo: NBC/NBC via Getty Images\n\nOver the past few years, almost all of Friends\u2019 stars have offered their moo points as to why a reboot or reunion of the show would be a very bad idea. Now, the showrunners themselves are also banishing the idea \u00e0 la \u201cthe Rachel\u201d in season three. (Or, uh, Marcel.) Speaking at Friends\u2019 25th anniversary panel at the Tribeca TV Festival on Friday evening, Marta Kauffman and David Crane confirmed that they\u2019ll never, ever be seduced by a large payday to revive the show. It\u2019s really done, folks! Just watch it on Netflix while you still can!\n\n\u201cWe will not be doing reunion show, we will not be doing a reboot,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cThere are two reasons for that. One of them is, the reason we won\u2019t be doing a reunion is this is a show about that time in your life when your friends are your family, and once you start having family, that changes. It wouldn\u2019t be at what\u2019s at the heart of the show. The other reason is, it\u2019s not going to be what we did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did the show we wanted to do,\u201d Crane added. \u201cWe got it right and put the bow on it that we wanted to put. As Marta says, if you visited those characters now, it would just have a different DNA and it would just not be the same show. Chances are it wouldn\u2019t be as good of a show. This feels like this is the show, so why go back to the well?\u201d The last time the cast reunited, in the basic sense of the word, was back in 2016 when 83.3 percent of them appeared (and fielded questions) at a tribute for director James Burrows. Sometimes they hang out on Instagram and look really cute, though.", "description": "Friends Showrunners Marta Kauffman and David Crane discussed how Friends will never never a reunion or reboot.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/05/05-friends.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
