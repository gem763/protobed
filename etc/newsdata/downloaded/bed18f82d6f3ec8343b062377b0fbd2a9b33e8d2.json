REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nLawmakers released Boeing documents that showed the company had considered adding an MCAS alert on the flight control panel to the 737 MAX. Another Boeing document warned that if a pilot failed to respond in more than 10 seconds to the software, activation could lead to a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d failure.\n\nMuilenburg acknowledged \u201cwe made some mistakes\u201d on the development of MCAS, an anti-stall system that automatically pushed the plane\u2019s nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control.\n\nU.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee holding the hearing, pressed Muilenburg on why the company had not required data from crucial airflow sensors known as attack sensors when it originally designed the airplane. Muilenburg said the company had repeatedly asked the same question.\n\nLast week, Indonesia investigators found Boeing failed to grasp risks in the design of MCAS.\n\n\u201cThe design and certification of the MCAS did not adequately consider the likelihood of loss of control of the aircraft,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe 737 MAX, when it returns, will have a number of new safeguards. It will take data from the attack sensors and not let MCAS activate more than once before a situation has been resolved.\n\nDeFazio asked why Boeing approved MCAS when it was vulnerable to a single point of failure.\n\nDeFazio also questioned why Boeing scrapped initial plans to install an MCAS \u201cannunciator\u201d alert and how pilots could be expected to recover if the system failed, when Boeing failed to disclose details on MCAS system to pilots. He also hammered Boeing\u2019s assumptions on how long it would take pilots to respond to a failure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of pissed off pilots,\u201d DeFazio said.\n\n\u201cWe need answers. We need reforms on how commercial aircraft are certified,\u201d and how manufacturers like Boeing \u201care watched\u201d by regulators, he added.\n\nMuilenburg began his opening remarks by turning and looking directly at family members of the victims seated closely behind him as he apologised for the 346 lives lost in crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.\n\nIn an earlier statement, DeFazio said the panel was aware of \u201cat least one case where a Boeing manager implored the then-vice president and general manager of the 737 program to shut down the 737 MAX production line because of safety concerns.\u201d Boeing did not comment Tuesday on the allegation.\n\nThe hearing, the highest-profile congressional scrutiny of commercial aviation safety in years, heaps pressure on a newly rejiggered Boeing senior management team fighting to repair trust with airline customers and passengers shaken by an eight-month safety ban on its 737 MAX following the two crashes.\n\nMuilenburg told reporters on Wednesday he believes the allegation was in response to concerns about a change in the increase of the production rate. He said Boeing was aware of those concerns and had acknowledged them.\n\nMuilenburg said that he had met with some family members of the victims before the Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cIt was tough to hear,\u201d he said, adding the company was making \u201cthe fixes we need to make.\u201d\n\nThe Boeing CEO on Tuesday acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on MCAS before the crashes, as well as for taking months to disclose that it had made optional an alarm that alerts pilots to a mismatch of flight data on the 737 MAX.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes and we got some things wrong. We\u2019re improving and we\u2019re learning,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. senators expressed dismay that 2016 instant messages discussing erratic behaviour of simulator software - a replica of the system aboard the jetliner - did not prompt an immediate reaction from the company.\n\nFor months, Boeing had largely failed to acknowledge blame, instead vowing to make a \u201csafe plane safer.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s hearing represented Boeing\u2019s broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes, but Muilenburg stopped short of what some lawmakers and family members had sought.\n\nAs they were at Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing, family members of victims were seated closely behind Muilenburg on Wednesday at the House hearing.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nadia Milleron, whose daughter was killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March, said Muilenburg and the board should resign for failing to do more to prevent the crashes.\n\nAs Muilenburg departed Tuesday\u2019s hearing, she implored him to look at the victims\u2019 families when he apologised. He turned to her and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "description": "Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg acknowledged the company made mistakes in the development of a key safety system known as MCAS at the centre of two fatal 737 MAX crashes, at a U.S. House hearing on Wednesday.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446489959&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0PN", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
