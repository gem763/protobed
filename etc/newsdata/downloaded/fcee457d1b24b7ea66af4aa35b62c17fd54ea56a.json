President Trump has repeatedly rejected the original complaint.\n\nNo details have been released about the second whistleblower's claims.\n\nHowever, Mr Zaid said the person had first-hand knowledge of allegations associated with the phone call Mr Trump made with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry stems from the call, which was flagged up by the initial whistleblower in August.\n\nOn Friday, the New York Times reported that a second person was considering coming forward who had \"more direct information\" about the events surrounding the call.\n\nIt is not yet known if this is the person represented by Mr Zaid.\n\nMr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani tweeted that he was not surprised there was another \"secret source\", calling the inquiry politically motivated and lashing out at the \"swamp media\".\n\nWhat difference could a second report make?\n\nThe Democrat-led investigating committee is eager to speak to someone who witnessed the call directly or has more information.\n\nThey are hopeful that this could be that person.\n\nThe second source has not yet filed an official complaint or spoken to the committee.\n\nHowever, the New York Times says the person spoke to the intelligence community's inspector general, who has reportedly been seeking to corroborate the first testimony.\n\nThe White House insists it has been open and it released a transcript of the call, after the concerns came to light.\n\nHowever, investigators point out that this was only a partial transcript. They have subpoenaed the State Department for more documents related to the call.\n\nOn Saturday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would comply with the request, but complained that his staff were being harassed.\n\nFour quick questions on Trump-Ukraine\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump impeachment: Was there quid pro quo?\n\nWhy is Mr Trump being investigated?\n\nA whistleblower alleges he used \"the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the US 2020 election\", by asking Ukraine to investigate his leading rival, Joe Biden.\n\nIs this illegal?\n\nIf this is what he's proven to have done, then yes: it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help winning a US election. Mr Trump says it's a witch-hunt and he did nothing wrong.\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nIf the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives voted to impeach Mr Trump, there'd be a trial in the Senate.\n\nCould he be removed?\n\nA Senate vote needs a two-thirds majority to convict, but Mr Trump's Republican party controls the Senate so that's unlikely. And the Mueller inquiry made clear you can't charge a sitting president with a crime.", "description": "A second whistleblower has come forward in the Trump-Ukraine inquiry, lawyers tell US media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0C96/production/_109122230_1d073243-759c-4b10-b010-29aa5f641573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
