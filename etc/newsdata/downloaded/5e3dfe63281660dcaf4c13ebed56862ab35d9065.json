REUTERS/Joseph Campbell\n\nHalfway across the room, a robot named EDGAR with an expressive face made of polyethylene, two hands and a torso atop a trolley with wheels, mimics the gesture, smacking its hand into that of Wong\u2019s wife and colleague, Pang Wee Ching.\n\nFor the last six years, the couple has been developing EDGAR, short for Expressions Display and Gesturing Avatar Robot, which lets people in different locations transmit gestures and facial expressions to each other.\n\nThey say their project is the next step in the field of communications, adding to voice and video provided by applications such as Skype.\n\n\u201cPerhaps I have a child who is living overseas, and she misses my cooking very much. What I can do with this technology is that I log onto the robot where she is and I can use it to make her favorite Chinese chicken rice,\u201d Wong said.\n\nTheir other autonomous robot, EDGAR-2, which is also built in humanoid form, can answer questions and hold lengthy conversations.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d said university student Edora Kwak after chatting with EDGAR-2 about a Malay folk song.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never imagine myself talking to a robot, and we actually held a pretty long conversation.\u201d\n\nFor Pang and Wong, who met a decade ago on the job, their creations are akin to children for whom they feel affection and pride.\n\n\u201cWe want it to progress, to grow. It seems like there\u2019s a life in it,\u201d they said, completing each other\u2019s sentences.\n\nThe couple welcomed a baby boy called Gabriel last month, and Pang, who programed both EDGAR-1 and EDGAR-2, laughed at the idea of their robotic creations inspiring how they will raise their human one, or vice-versa.\n\n\u201cMaybe when I take care of the baby and learn more about how human life works, this can be applied to building the intelligence of the robot,\u201d she said.", "description": "Singaporean robot creator Wong Choon Yue raises his left hand and swipes it past a sensor in a high-five gesture.", "authors": ["Travis Teo", "Joseph Campbell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428680015&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0Y1-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
