More accurately, they are a state of fatigue.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a Tuesday or a Saturday, sometimes all you want is an uninterrupted stretch of peace and quiet, maybe some leftovers and a chance to wear out the Netflix subscription. That, and a couple of glasses of decent wine.\n\nWine with dinner is an easy win, especially with a bottle that is not only good enough to pique your interest and reward your attention, but one that is also inexpensive, without requirements for concentration or close observation.\n\nPlenty of bottles can fulfill that mission. The crucial points are to have a few of these wines on hand at all times, and not to confuse them with inexpensive, processed big brands that can be bought without thought because they are ubiquitous.\n\nMost of the bottles in the category that I am recommending will cost a little more than the bottom-rung selections. Sure, you can find sound wines for less than $10. Some will seem confected, others simple, and most will not be particularly interesting. Maybe that\u2019s fine.", "description": "On those nights when you just need to flop, find a wine that\u2019s alive, interesting, easy to enjoy and moderately priced.
