It gives travellers the space to work, sleep and relax.\n\nEtihad's A380 First Apartment features a separate ottoman that converts into a flatbed.\n\nOur First Apartments are configured 1-1 across a single aisle and each one is equipped with a leather armchair and separate ottoman that transforms into a flatbed. The TV monitor swings out so you can watch a film before going to sleep, then switch on the news in the morning.\n\nWhere you\u2019ll find it From Sydney to Abu Dhabi and onwards to Paris, London, New York, and Seoul.\n\nGo-to dish and wine Freshly seared scallops with baby fennel, grapefruit and salsa verde. For main, the traditional Middle Eastern spiced lamb shank mandi, and I always enjoy a selection of cheeses, artisan crackers and seasonal fruit.\n\nFor wine, on my last flight, I landed on the 2014 Schloss Vollrads Riesling Kabinett Trocken from Rheingau in Germany.\n\nTop flying tip Our turndown service lets me select when I want to eat and sleep to suit my body clock; the pillow mist and pulse point oils in our amenity kits aid sleep, while the onboard shower refreshes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst-class suites in Qatar Airway's A380s, which fly daily from Sydney and Melbourne to Doha.\n\nQatar Airways\n\nAdam Radwanski, senior manager for Australasia\n\nThe experience First class is only available on our A380s and it\u2019s such a special experience. On the rest of our fleet, Qatar Airways\u2019 business-class Qsuite features many first-class elements, including individual suites and elegant interiors. I\u2019m comfortable in either, although I must add I prefer flying in an A350.\n\nWhere you\u2019ll find it A380s fly daily from Sydney and Melbourne to Doha; we also fly to Doha from Adelaide, Canberra and Auckland.\n\nGo-to dish and wine Prawn salad with a chardonnay, or an eye fillet steak with a shiraz.\n\nTop flying tip Go for a run before a flight to get an energy boost; it\u2019s also a good idea to work out on arrival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmirates First Class Suites can be found found on A380 flights from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.\n\nEmirates\n\nBarry Brown, divisional vice president for Australasia\n\nThe experience An A380 First Class Suite is as close as it comes to a private jet, given you fly in an enclosed suite. One of my favourite onboard features is the shower spa, with heated floor and luxurious amenities.\n\nWhere\u2019ll you find it From Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth to our hub in Dubai and select onward connections; our A380s fly to 45 destinations in total.\n\nGo-to dish and wine Vine-ripened tomatoes and burrata from Italy with a glass of Dom P\u00e9rignon 2008 champagne or the 2004 Ch\u00e2teau Margaux Bordeaux blend.\n\nTop flying tip With more than 30 years in the airline industry, I\u2019ve had my fair share of jet lag. I like to use my time in the air to relax, unwind, enjoy the onboard luxuries and catch a program on the Emirates Food and Wine channel. Remaining hydrated is key; get enough rest and sleep at appropriate times, but don\u2019t oversleep. Avoid caffeine if possible and stretch your legs regularly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wood-panelled onboard upstairs lounge on Qantas A380s, designed by Sydney\u2019s Caon Studio.\n\nQantas\n\nJeramie Hotz, interior designer (with her husband David Caon) at Caon Studio\n\nThe experience Refurbishing A380 interiors for Qantas has transformed the upper deck into an expanded lounge with seating for 10 people on deep green leather couches, surrounded by wood-panelled walls. The updated Martin Grant amenity kit is next level, and the colour scheme works even better now in first.\n\nWhere you\u2019ll find it Flights from Sydney to Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Singapore and London; Melbourne to Los Angeles and Singapore; Sydney to Hong Kong during peak season.\n\nGo-to dish and wine Always a glass of Taittinger or Pol Roger champagne to get the flight started. I keep it light in terms of meals, usually a soup or one of Neil Perry\u2019s Asian-inspired dishes. I stay away from the sweet stuff, but the cheese platter is a no-brainer.\n\nTop flying tip It\u2019s all about hydration: steer clear of too much alcohol. I\u2019ve recently started flying with a HumidiFlyer mask. I get strange looks, but I\u2019m convinced it helps with jet lag and dehydration.\n\nThe 68-page bumper Grand Journeys issue of Sophisticated Traveller is out on Friday, October 18 inside The Australian Financial Review.
