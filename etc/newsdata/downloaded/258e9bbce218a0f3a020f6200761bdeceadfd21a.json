She spoke to Harry Dunn to tell him that she would call for help. She waved down another car.\n\n'That driver pulled over and offered to assist Harry so that Anne could comfort her young children, who had been in her car and were on the scene.'\n\nThe spokesman added that Ministry of Defence police arrived shortly after the crash but it took a 'long time' for the ambulance to arrive.\n\nIt is seven weeks since Mrs Sacoolas collided with Harry's motorbike on the road outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.\n\nIn her first account of what happened, she also said she spoke to 19-year-old Harry (pictured) at the scene before comforting her own children, who were in her car\n\nMrs Sacoolas, whose husband Jonathan worked as US intelligence official at the base, claimed diplomatic immunity and left the UK.\n\nThe statement went on: 'She and her family left the United Kingdom approximately three weeks after the accident, after they and the US authorities determined that it would be difficult for the couple and their children to remain in the small Croughton community under these tragic circumstances.\n\n'She and her family returned home on a commercial flight. Our understanding is that the British authorities were informed and aware of their departure before they returned to the United States.'\n\nIt is seven weeks since Mrs Sacoolas collided with Harry's motorbike (pictured) on the road outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire\n\nIt came as Harry's father told of the final words he said to his teenage son as he lay fatally injured after being hit by a car.\n\nTim Dunn, who had reached the scene of the accident when Harry was still alive, said: 'I could see broken bones coming out of his arms, but he was talking. I called over and said: 'Harry, it's your dad, they are going to fix you, be calm.'\n\n'He stopped moaning and calmed then,' he told US news channel CBS, 'and a couple of minutes later one of the doctors said they needed to sedate him because he was having trouble breathing.'\n\nTim Dunn (pictured), who had reached the scene of the accident when the 19-year-old was still alive, said: 'I could see broken bones coming out of his arms, but he was talking\n\nMr Dunn told his son (pictured with mother Charlotte) he would be sedated because it was 'for the best' and said he would see him in hospital\n\nMr Dunn told his son he would be sedated because it was 'for the best' and said he would see him in hospital.\n\nThese were the last words between father and son as Harry never woke up.\n\nAfter flying to the US, Harry's parents are on a campaign to get Mrs Sacoolas to return.

Face the UK justice system.'\n\nMrs Sacoolas, whose husband Jonathan worked as US intelligence official at the base, claimed diplomatic immunity and left the UK.

If you are a father and your child died surely you'd want that person to own up and take responsibility for their actions.'\n\nOn Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Harry's family saying that Mrs Sacoolas no longer had diplomatic immunity from potential prosecution because her husband had left his posting at the RAF base.\n\nIf Northamptonshire Police submit a file of evidence which meets the US extradition threshold, she could be extradited to face justice here.", "description": "Anne Sacoolas, 42, (pictured) said she had 'no time to react' when the teenager came towards her on his motorbike over a hill.", "authors": ["Arthur Martin In New York For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/01/19717326-0-image-a-46_1571098730553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
