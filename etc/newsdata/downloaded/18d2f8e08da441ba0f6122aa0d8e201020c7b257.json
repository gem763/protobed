But over the past three years, as waves of readers have claimed the novel as a symbol of the \u2018resistance\u2019 \u2026 the fictional world of Gilead has become a phenomenon that threatens to escape its author\u2019s hold.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcdaThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale, by Margaret Atwood / \ud83d\udcfa created by Bruce Miller\n\n\ud83d\udcdaThe Testaments, by Margaret Atwood\n\n\ud83d\udcdaAlias Grace, by Margaret Atwood / \ud83d\udcfa adapted by Sarah Polley\n\nA new Catch-22 finds madness and magic in a classic\n\n\u201cIn the sense that a TV show can capture the spirit of something, Catch-22 is magical, maddening, tender, and caustic in equal measure. Its upside-down logic confronts you with the beauty of life and the monstrousness of a war whose only objective is to snuff that beauty out at every opportunity.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcdaCatch-22, by Joseph Heller / \ud83d\udcfa adapted by Luke Davies and David Mich\u00f4d\n\nThe glory of Oprah and the power of television\n\n\u201cShe got [her belief in a better life] from books, because she read the way many people who have been abused will read\u2014in a deep, immersive way, impervious to the outside world, willing herself into the streets and bright living rooms and spirited discussions of the novels. Books are what got her though the sexual abuse: \u2018I knew there was another kind of life,\u2019 she has said of that time. \u2018I knew it because I\u2019d read about it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcdaThe Color Purple, by Alice Walker\n\n\ud83d\udcdaThe Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison\n\n\ud83d\udcdaI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, by Maya Angelou\n\n\ud83d\udcdaFrom This Moment On, by Shania Twain\n\n\ud83d\udcfaThe Oprah Winfrey Show\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg on BoJack Horseman and writing surreal love stories\n\n\u201cSomeone Who Will Love You in All Your Damaged Glory \u2026 channels much of the same caustic humor and heartrending dialogue as [BoJack Horseman]. The stories alternate between surreal, sci-fi\u2013inspired tales and more grounded vignettes, but many are a poignant mixture of both tones.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcdaSomeone Who Will Love You in All Your Damaged Glory, by Raphael Bob-Waksberg\n\n\ud83d\udcfa BoJack Horseman, created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg\n\nPatrick Melrose is a lacerating tour de force\n\n\u201cThe genius of Edward St. Aubyn\u2019s five Patrick Melrose novels is in how relentlessly they amalgamate horror and beauty. The loosely autobiographical series \u2026 depicts child sexual abuse, drug addiction, alcoholism, and a smorgasbord of emotional torture, but does so in such entrancing prose that it insulates the reader from the unbearable.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda Never Mind, by Edward St. Aubyn\n\n\ud83d\udcda Bad News, by Edward St. Aubyn\n\n\ud83d\udcda Some Hope, by Edward St. Aubyn\n\n\ud83d\udcda Mother\u2019s Milk, by Edward St. Aubyn\n\n\ud83d\udcda At Last, by Edward St. Aubyn\n\n\ud83d\udcfaPatrick Melrose, adapted by David Nicholls\n\nThe Reference Desk\n\n(New York Public Library)\n\nWrite to the Books Briefing team at booksbriefing@theatlantic.com or reply directly to this email with any of your reading-related dilemmas.
