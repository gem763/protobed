I don\u2019t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\u201d Hunter Biden said, before admitting his family\u2019s political prominence played a large role in all of his dealings. \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014you know\u2014I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d\n\nHe further added that there is \u201cliterally nothing, as a young man or as a full grown adult\u201d that his \u201cfather in some way hasn\u2019t had influence over.\u201d\n\nThe interview with ABC News comes as Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings have spilled out into the open, causing a serious problem for his father\u2019s presidential campaign. The controversy started last month when President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government probe into how the younger Biden secured an appointment to Burisma\u2019s board, shortly after his father was made the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine.\n\nAs Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month despite no background in energy or Ukraine. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThe timing of the appointment not only raised flags among ethics watchdogs, but also with Hunter Biden\u2019s own business partners. Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry and co-owner of an investment firm with Hunter Biden in 2014, rushed to play damage control with State Department officials at the time of the appointment, according to internal emails obtained by the Washington Examiner.\n\nAdding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.", "description": "Hunter Biden admitted his father\u2019s position helped secure an appointment to the board of directors of a Ukrainian oil and gas company.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Hunter-Biden-ABC-News-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
