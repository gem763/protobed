Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told moderators at Tuesday\u2019s Democrat Party debate that Turkey\u2019s alliance with the United States no longer exists in the event that the government there commits \u201cmass slaughter.\u201d\n\nSanders was referring to Turkey\u2019s \u201cOperation Peace Spring,\u201d an invasion of Syrian Kurdistan (Rojava) whose stated mission is to eradicate the Kurdish presence in Kurdistan and replace the locals with mostly Arab Syrian refugees. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-allied militia operating in Rojava, has warned that the plan necessarily requires ethnic cleansing.\n\n\u201cTurkey is not a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter,\u201d Sanders asserted.\n\nTurkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a post-World War II alliance whose treaty provisions do not state that a member is automatically expelled from the group if they \u201cengage in mass slaughter.\u201d The treaty binds Washington to recognize an attack on Turkey as an attack on the U.S. homeland and act accordingly.\n\nTurkey joined NATO in 1952 and, while not fulfilling the stated goal of all NATO countries investing two percent of their GDP into defense, is relatively close at 1.89 percent. Turkey is closer to paying its share than France, Denmark, Germany, and Canada.\n\nThe treaty that gives NATO its name requires member nations to defend each other in the event that one is attacked, meaning America must send military aid if Turkey demands it upon being invaded.\n\n\u201cThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence,\u201d the treaty reads.\n\nThe treaty also has several provisions that, under Islamist President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has flagrantly disregarded. It requires member nations to strengthen their \u201cfree institutions\u201d like the press and civil society, which Erdogan has all but shut down in the aftermath of a failed coup against him in 2016. Erdogan has also violated detailed provisions that NATO put in place subsequent to the treaty to keep the alliance functional \u2014 most notably, purchasing Russian S-400 missiles that are incompatible with NATO military hardware against the alliance\u2019s rules.\n\nThe treaty allows members to leave but does not explicitly provide for expelling a member.", "description": "Socialist Sen.
