Going private means health care groups don't have to disclose a whole lot about their finances or strategy.\n\nKKR did not respond to questions. Envision said in a statement it would live up to its pledge to move almost all of its out-of-network contracts to in-network contracts by the end of this year.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill still has not updated the public about her inquiry into Envision's billing practices.\n\nLooking ahead: Private equity owners don't have incentives to eradicate out-of-network practices, which Cooper called the \"ugly pockets of the U.S. health care system.\"\n\n\"That's just discouraging, and it makes people want to go to single payer,\" Cooper said.", "description": "Market power rules health care and attracts private equity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/lwc74-VK1nLgCeIYbPSTFP_N-00=/0x144:3800x2282/1920x1080/2018/06/11/1528737490841.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-11"}
