A real variety of creative champions here, let me tell you.\n\nJoining them on the biggest party-hop of the season is B Wise, A. Swayze And The Ghosts, Adrian Eagle, and the best tongue-twister in the game right now, Teen Jesus And The Jean Teasers. Seriously, say that one fast three times.\n\nNow, for the acts that might just lock-in where you\u2019ll end up for the big countdown. Get the group chat together to discuss logistics because you\u2019re going to have to figure out which collection of massive legends you want to see cap off your Falls Fest this year.\n\nIn Byron Bay, Tash Sultana is already down to jam through a hazy, summery set, and she\u2019ll be joined by Thundamentals, Cosmo\u2019s Midnight and Concrete Surfers are set to round out the NSW leg of the tour.\n\nDown in Lorne, the home of Falls Fest, What So Not are already very much locked in for a huge set that will keep your heart rate thumping, and they\u2019ll be accompanied by indie-pop darlings The Jungle Giants, Post Malone\u2019s new besties Lime Cordiale, and ferociously upbeat rapper Kwame.\n\nFurther south in Marion Bay, the lineup will be maxed out with the inclusion of Illy, Tassie\u2019s finest boys Luca Brasi, and ethereal honey Kat Edwards, who will be joining Aus rock\u2019s favourite uncles, Wolfmother.\n\nFinally, with Matt Corby over in Fremantle \u2013 where the new year is rung in about 12 hours after the east coast \u2013 Lime Cordiale will be hooning across to the west coast, to be joined by Sampa The Great and Sly Withers to bring the other side of the country screaming into 2020.\n\nSo there you go mates, take your arguments to the table with your mates and lock in your NYE festival. You can still grab tickets from the Falls Festival website, so lock those in ASAP.\n\nFALLS FEST LINEUP 2019/2020\n\nHALSEY (ONLY AUS SHOWS)\n\nVAMPIRE WEEKEND\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\nPEKING DUK\n\nOF MONSTERS AND MEN\n\nPNAU\n\nLEWIS CAPALDI\n\nMILKY CHANCE\n\nJOHN FARNHAM\n\nBANKS (ONLY AUS SHOWS)\n\nDOPE LEMON\n\nVERA BLUE\n\nYUNGBLUD\n\nG FLIP\n\nCROOKED COLOURS\n\nPARCELS\n\nTHELMA PLUM\n\n#1 DADS\n\nWAAX\n\nBAKER BOY\n\nPSYCHEDELIC PORN CRUMPETS\n\nAMYL & THE SNIFFERS\n\nTHE JAPANESE HOUSE\n\nPINK SWEAT$\n\nGOOD DOOGS\n\nCXLOE\n\nTOTTY\n\nWITH LOCAL LEGENDS APPEARING AT :\n\n\n\nBYRON BAY\n\nTASH SULTANA\n\nTHUNDAMENTALS\n\nCOSMO\u2019S MIDNIGHT\n\nCONCRETE SURFERS\n\n\n\nLORNE\n\nWHAT SO NOT\n\nTHE JUNGLE GIANTS\n\nLIME CORDIALE\n\nKWAME\n\n\n\nMARION BAY\n\nWOLFMOTHER\n\nILLY\n\nLUCA BRASI\n\nKAT EDWARDS\n\n\n\nFREMANTLE\n\nMATT CORBY\n\nLIME CORDIALE\n\nSAMPA THE GREAT\n\nSLY WITHERS", "description": "Falls Fest absolutely isn't done just yet, bulking out its massive lineup with the likes of Playboi Carti, Montaigne, Sampa The Great, Lime Cordiale & more.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/playboy-carti-2019-fb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
