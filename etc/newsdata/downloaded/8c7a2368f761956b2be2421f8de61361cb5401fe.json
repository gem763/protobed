Rand Paul (R-KY) said last week that the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d should \u201ccome forward\u201d given the fallout of his or her complaint.\n\n\u201cUltimately, if someone\u2019s going to accuse you of something that\u2019s going to bring down a presidency, I think we deserve to know who that person is,\u201d Sen. Paul said.\n\n\u201cI think there are reasons to have whistleblower statutes, and have anonymity. But if you\u2019re accusing somebody of something with the ramifications of impeachment, I think really the person ought to come forward,\u201d he added.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) contended that the whistleblowers should be interviewed under oath.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen: if the whistleblowers\u2019 allegations are turned into an impeachment article it\u2019s imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public, under oath, and cross-examined,\u201d Graham said Sunday.\n\nGraham added that if this does not happen in the House,\u201dI\u2019ll make sure it happens in the Senate.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump tweeted last week, asking why the country is not \u201centitled\u201d to learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him.\n\nSo if the so-called \u201cWhistleblower\u201d has all second hand information, and almost everything he has said about my \u201cperfect\u201d call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi & Schiff), why aren\u2019t we entitled to interview & learn everything about\u2026. \u2014 Donald J.
