It was designed by Emma Pearson and her Shropshire-based Feathercast company\n\nShe feels clubby, neither too masculine nor feminine and wallpaper, cushions and carpets are luxuriously textured. It\u2019s an offering I\u2019d associated with the grand old dames of Cunard but not a brand new ship.\n\nAs a cruise novice I navigate this boutique (999 passengers deems it as such) ship with ease.\n\nI rather fancy eating in the grand dining room flanked by marble columns which opens up to The Club by Jools (Holland) but head to my cabin instead.\n\nI examine the curious metal bedside lamp switches, beautiful little woodpeckers and am drawn to touch the teal, mustard and ash silk cushions, then to the balcony where there\u2019s plenty of room for two chairs.\n\nMy bathroom, stocked with supersized shampoo and soaps, is not cramped either.\n\nThe Spirit of Discovery may be brand new, but she has all the offerings of the grand old cruise liners of yesteryear\n\nSleek as my cabin is, whoever unpacks in the Rose Suite is in for a treat of gold leaf and black and white deco design and a marble bathroom.\n\nSolo travellers can rejoice too \u2013 109 cabins are for single occupancy.\n\nThe Duchess of Cornwall is the ship\u2019s fitting godmother: fun, with a winking sense of humour and impeccable style.\n\nWhere do I sign up, please? Ah. Sadly not possible until I reach 50 \u2013 unless I set sail with my own silver traveller.", "description": "Saga's Spirit of Discovery ship has a million-pound art collection of 1,200 commissioned pieces.
