And thus, RIP to your walls and furniture.\n\nThankfully though, there is a measure you can take to keep them occupied and get them to jazz up your living room.\n\nYou can get a wallpaper designed for colouring in. Just make sure the kids are drawing inside the lines.\n\nA woman spotted the product on Amazon and raved about it on Facebook.\n\nJade Louie, from Manchester, proved that colouring in doesn\u2019t just have to be for kids as she purchased the black and white wallpaper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe uploaded a picture of her own wall, which is slowly getting more and more colourful, on Facebook page Mrs Hinch Made Me Do It.\n\nPerfect for kids (Picture: Amazon)\n\nJade, 28, has had the wallpaper for some time and initially coloured it in using bright felt tip pens. But over the years, the colours slowly faded.\n\nSo she got the pens out once again and got to work.\n\nShe wrote on the post: \u2018I started this three years ago but the sun slowly drained the colour!\n\n\u2018So re-tackling it!! Three hours in and it\u2019s brightening up again.\u2019\n\nNaturally, parents wanted to get their hands on the wallpaper to get their children colouring.\n\nOne mum wrote on Jade\u2019s post: \u2018This would keep the kids amused. Another wrote: \u2018Please let me know [where this is from], my son is autistic and he would live to colour this in, I\u2019d put it in his bedroom.\u2019\n\nJade revealed she got it from Amazon where, unfortunately, this print is no longer available.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of other wallpapers that encourage getting creative.\n\nYou can choose from a monster scene, nature and other bits to colour in.\n\nMORE: Parents are loving this vegan head lice spray that also detangles thick, curly hair\n\nMORE: Mum praised for sharing photo that sums up the reality of parenting\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Jade Louie from Manchester proved that colouring doesn't just have to be for kids with this black and white wallpaper from Amazon.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89225402_1570692863.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
