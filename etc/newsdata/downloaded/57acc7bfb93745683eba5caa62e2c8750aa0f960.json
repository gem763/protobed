But he said the campaign decided to file a police complaint because of the hateful nature of the graffiti.\n\n\"Such hate doesn't have a place in Canadian politics,\" he said. \"Everyone should call out such actions.\"\n\n3 signs defaced in Pierrefonds-Dollard\n\nIn Pierrefonds-Dollard, at least three campaign signs belonging to Conservative candidate Mariam Ishak were also defaced with swastikas.\n\nHelen Thibault, a spokesperson for Ishak's campaign, said they began noticing the vandalized signs on Sunday. They too filed a police complaint on Monday.\n\nSeveral of Conservative candidate Mariam Ishak's signs were defaced with swastikas. (Dennis Cleary/CBC)\n\n\"There's just no room for hate in the community of Pierrefonds-Dollard, nor is there room for hate in any community across Canada. We need to be better than this,\" she said.\n\nIt's not clear whether either candidate was specifically targeted; neither is Jewish.\n\nThe Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs issued a statement decrying the signs.\n\n\"Defacing election signs is illegal and anti-democratic. Using swastikas is particularly egregious,\" it wrote on Twitter.", "description": "Swastikas have been scrawled on Liberal signs in the Montreal-area riding of Hochelaga and Conservative signs in Pierrefonds.", "authors": ["Kate Mckenna Is A Reporter With Cbc Montreal.
