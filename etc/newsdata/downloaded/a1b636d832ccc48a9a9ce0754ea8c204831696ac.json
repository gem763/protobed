That was really evident.\u2019\n\nWayne Rooney has agreed to join Philip Cocu's Derby County as a player-coach in January\n\nEasy? For a newly promoted side who lost some of their best players against a club that came within a play-off final defeat of stepping out in the Premier League this season?\n\nDerby\u2019s ambitions far out-strip those of Charlton \u2014 at least off the pitch, hence the signing of Rooney.\n\nWith his time Stateside coming to an end on Saturday with defeat in the MLS play-offs, the former England captain is now free to bring forward his arrival in the east Midlands from the original January schedule. How Derby need him. And quickly.\n\nMacauley Bonne celebrates after scoring the opening goal in Charlton's 3-0 win over Derby\n\nA Macauley Bonne strike on the turn, a Naby Sarr header from a corner and a glorious 20-yard curler from on-loan Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher eased Charlton to only their second victory since August, yet it could have been so many more.\n\nLike his manager Phillip Cocu, a Dutch master outwitted by Bowyer\u2019s impressive tinkering to nullify the opposition\u2019s strengths, Derby defender Curtis Davies was at a loss to explain his side\u2019s awful attitude and desire.\n\nDavies said: \u2018I wish I could put my finger on it. Charlton have a very energetic midfield. They get about the pitch and we couldn\u2019t match them. We didn\u2019t make them work hard enough for their goals or create anything at the other end.\u2019", "description": "IVAN SPECK AT THE VALLEY: Judging by Saturday's abject surrender at The Valley, the Wayne Rooney era at Derby cannot come soon enough.", "authors": ["Ivan Speck For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/19/19963052-0-image-a-9_1571597885956.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
