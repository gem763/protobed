What I did learn is that Strictly is not reality. It\u2019s a television show where emotions are very much heightened,\" he told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t cross any lines with Natasha. I was single. Camilla had ended the relationship very early on in the series so what happened happened after that.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: DAVID VENNI)\n\n\"It was a harrowing time - winning the show as much as my friendship with Natasha. On the other hand it was like, Holy Moses. It can ruin a marriage so easily.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Brendan, 43, also got into his fair share of spats with the judges over the years.\n\nHe once took aim at the salaries, insisting that despite working 14 hour days, he couldn't afford a car.\n\n\"My money from Strictly just about pays the bills. I don\u2019t have a car. I would like to get one, but until then I'm on the Tube. I don't even own my house. I can't afford it. I rent where I live,\" he told Now magazine of his rumoured \u00a335,000 salary.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBut judge Bruno Tonioli - who is believed to earn around \u00a3110,000 - had zero sympathy for the dancers, telling The Mirror: \"Those are the terms of the negotiations. If you don\u2019t like it, stop moaning and f**k off!\"\n\nBrendan was also rumoured to have been embroiled in a behind-the-scenes feud with head judge Shirley Ballas , after she scored the head judge job he'd been favourite for.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone that was up for it would want it. It is an amazing opportunity in terms of a spot,\" he said at the time.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a natural progression from being a dancer on the show. I was obviously disappointed that I didn\u2019t get it but at the same time my place has always been a dancer on the show.\"\n\nAnd James Jordan , who was a professional on the show alongside his wife Ola, took to Twitter to accuse the BBC of disliking anyone who 'has an opinion'.\n\n\"Just seen my mate @BrendanCole has not been asked back on Strictly,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Seems like they don\u2019t want anyone on the show that has an opinion. Especially when he played a massive part in making the show what it is today.\n\n\"Wishing him all the best in his future endeavours. Will be missed.\"\n\nSpeaking about his departure from the show in January 2018, Brendan told ITV's Lorraine that his sacking was an 'editorial decision'.\n\n\"This is quite hard to talk about. The BBC haven\u2019t renewed my contract \u2013 we get renewed year on year \u2013 and they made an editorial decision not to have me back on the show,\" he said.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"I\u2019m a little bit in shock. I\u2019m quite emotional, a bit raw about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known this day would come... I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll never know the ins and outs. I\u2019m a very strong character within the show, I have my strong views.\u201d\n\nHe received the 'disappointing' news via a phone call, and said he only told the pros about his exit 10 minutes before appearing on Lorraine.\n\nHe also said wife Zoe Hobbs was 'upset' for him and that he would have preferred to have made the decision to leave himself, without being shoved out the door.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s their decision, the powers that be within the BBC, they\u2019ll have a vision of the show and I\u2019m not part of the vision, that\u2019s OK. Listen, I accept, you\u2019ve got to accept what decisions are made.\n\n\u201cI would have preferred to have made the decision myself, but maybe I would never have made it because I love being on the show.\"\n\nBrendan now lives in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire with British model Zoe and their daughter Aurelia, six, and one-year-old son Dante.", "description": "X Factor: Celebrity star Brendan Cole was the first person linked to the 'Strictly Curse' back in 2004", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Sunday Mirror", "Bbc", "David Venni", "Rex Shutterstock", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554268.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_SMX_NB_DANCE_22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
