Hoerner\u2019s second homer in two days, a three-run drive in the sixth, broke the Cubs\u2018 old mark of 235, established in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool to set records,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cWe love it. Home runs are fun and it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nBen Zobrist and Victor Caratini added solo shots as the Cubs used a second straight big day at the plate to strengthen their bid for a fifth straight postseason berth. Chicago has outscored Pittsburgh 31-9 in the first two games of the series and won three straight overall.\n\nChicago entered in the second NL wild card spot, one game ahead of Milwaukee and four games behind NL Central-leading St. Louis. The Cardinals hosted the Brewers on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to kind of get those non-stressful wins,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cOur offense is doing great, scoring runs. Let\u2019s keep this up and right now I think we should feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve been able to do.\u201d\n\nManager Joe Maddon doesn\u2019t expect double-digit production, but he\u2019s been impressed by his hitters\u2019 approaches.\n\n\u201cWe hit the ball extremely well again and when it counted,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty good at not swinging at bad pitches the last two days. We\u2019ve not been chasing so much. When you see your pitch, you\u2019re not missing it.\u201d\n\nKyle Hendricks (11-9) allowed a run on seven hits in six innings while walking none for his third straight solid outing. He has a 1.52 ERA in the span.\n\n\u201cI felt really good, locked in,\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cThe fastball command kind of got better as the game went, but my changeup was a lot better today.\u201d\n\nNicholas Castellanos doubled twice to take over the major league lead with 52 and drove in three runs. Anthony Rizzo had two RBIs and was one of four Chicago batters hit by pitches.\n\nBryant\u2019s two-run shot to the left-center basket in the fourth inning was his 29th homer this season. It was the 136th of his career, tying him with Ernie Banks for the most by a Cubs player in his first five seasons.\n\nPlaying in his sixth game since joining the Cubs on Monday, Hoerner improved his batting average to .417.\n\nJames Marvel (0-2) allowed seven runs on nine hits in four innings in his second major league start. Kevin Newman had a single, double and triple.\n\nMarvel was impressed by the Cubs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re veteran guys who put together good at-bats and I wasn\u2019t very sharp today, didn\u2019t really do my job,\u201d Marvel said. \u201cI just need to find a way to get better from this.\u201d\n\nBoth benches cleared briefly in the sixth after pinch-hitter David Bote ducked into a high pitch from reliever Clay Holmes and was hit on the shoulder. Bote, the fourth Cubs batter plunked, shouted at Holmes before going to first and the teams returned to their dugouts without an altercation.\n\nCubs reliever Dillon Maples hit Elias D\u00edaz and Erik Gonz\u00e1lez with pitches in the ninth before Derek Holland finished.\n\nMaddon said Holmes has been struggling with his command and conceded Maples wasn\u2019t sharp.\n\n\u201c(Holmes) didn\u2019t try to hit our guys,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t try to hit their guys. Today, there was no reason to escalate any of that.\u201d\n\nCastellanos lined a double to the left-field corner with the bases loaded in the second to give Chicago a 3-0 lead. Bryant followed with an RBI single.\n\nZobrist hit his first homer in the third to make it 5-0. The 2016 World Series MVP didn\u2019t play in the majors from May 6 until Sept. 3 while he was on the restricted list to deal with a divorce.\n\nThe Cubs scored three times in the fifth to reach double digits for the second straight day, following a 17-8 win on Friday.\n\nAfter Rizzo singled in two runs, Holmes entered and grazed Castellanos with an inside pitch to load the bases. Holmes plunked Bryant on the shoulder with his first pitch to the slugger to force in a run.\n\nHoerner went deep in the sixth and Caratini homered in the seventh.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPirates: 1B Josh Bell is day-to-day (groin strain) after leaving Friday\u2019s game. \u2026 CF Starling Marte (left wrist sprain) was out of the lineup for a sixth straight game and was limited to pinch running.\n\nCubs: INF Addison Russell remains under the concussion protocol after being beaned last Sunday in Milwaukee. There\u2019s no timetable for his return. \u2026 RHP Craig Kimbrel (right elbow inflammation) was scheduled for light toss on Saturday. Manager Joe Maddon expects to know more about a possible return date for the closer after he throws a bullpen session on Sunday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPirates RHP Trevor Williams (7-6, 5.21 ERA) faces Cubs LHP Jos\u00e9 Quintana (13-8, 4.15) on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "All of a sudden, the Chicago Cubs are locked in at the plate and looking like a confident, playoff-bound team again.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Carlson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/aptopix_pirates_cubs_baseball_08143_c0-171-4106-2565_s1770x1032.jpg?b2a5ad89c6bb3b2bc5f8232b3ef29aac1d62d5b5", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
