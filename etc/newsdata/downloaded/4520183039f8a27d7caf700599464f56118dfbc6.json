It includes artists, students, bureaucrats, workers at non-governmental agencies and people receiving health treatments.\n\nThis time around, the three candidates running for the Liberals, NDP and Conservatives in Nunavut are all Inuit women.\n\nCecile Lyall is in a post-secondary program in Ottawa, but she plans to vote in Nunavut. (Julie Ireton/CBC)\n\n\"It's very inspiring because a young girl at home right, now she can picture herself running for federal elections, maybe someday running for prime minister,\" said Lyall, who is related to Nunavut's Liberal candidate.\n\nAs Lyall watches the Nunavut campaign from afar, two of the main issues for her are housing and food security in the North.\n\n\"This election, it's very refreshing because we see Indigenous issues and the betterment of the people really at the forefront of each of their campaigns, and a lot of it has to do with the youth.\"\n\nIndigenous youth\n\nThe fastest-growing segment of Canada's Indigenous population is young people, according to Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN).\n\nThe AFN is calling on the federal government to consider that young population when making policy decisions, and to invest in \"human capital\" such as training and education programs.\n\n\"You're going to get huge returns on investment in the future. Canada's got an aging workforce \u2014 you got a skilled labour shortage there,\" Bellegarde said at a recent event at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Que.\n\nProgress doesn't mean parity. - Perry Bellegarde, AFN\n\nLiberals across the country are campaigning on their record when it comes to Indigenous Canadians.\n\nAt a recent all-candidate's meeting in Ottawa Centre, Liberal candidate Catherine McKenna said the party has made investments and commitments, and has moved forward with land claim settlements \u2014 but she acknowledged there's more work to do.\n\nWhile Bellegarde notes change is happening, he noted a huge gap still exists between the treatment of Indigenous people and the rest of the population.\n\n\"Progress doesn't mean parity. We have a lot of work to do working with governments both federal and provincial,\" he said. \"The number 1 issue is climate change and then restorative justice and then continued investments in housing and water and infrastructure and education.\"\n\nIndigenous candidate\n\nThe only candidate in eastern Ontario or western Quebec who identifies as Indigenous is Lorraine Rekmans, the Green candidate in Leeds\u2013Grenville\u2013Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes.\n\nRekmans, a band member of the Anishinaabe First Nation of Serpent River, moved to Ottawa in 2000 to work for the National Aboriginal Forestry Association.\n\nLorraine Rekmans, the only candidate in eastern Ontario or western Quebec to identify as Indigenous, is running for the Green Party in Leeds\u2013Grenville\u2013Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes. (Rekmans/submitted)\n\nShe now helps run a family business in Kemptville, Ont., and is the Indigenous affairs critic for the Greens. This is her first time on the ballot for the party.\n\nClimate change, resource management and the younger generation are all issues on Rekmans's radar.\n\n\"Indigenous youth are ending up in an urban areas, and we have to make sure that we have services to support them in that transition, because a lot of people move for employment opportunities,\" she said.\n\nJust last week, the federal government decided to challenge the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that calls for the compensation of First Nations children who've been taken from their homes and communities.\n\nIt's a decision could leave the government on the hook for billions of dollars in compensation.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer also supports a judicial review of the decision.\n\n\"This is a far-reaching decision that has major impacts on multiple levels of government,\" Scheer said. \"It would be appropriate to have a judicial review.\"\n\nThe NDP's Emilie Taman, running in Ottawa Centre, said her party would respect the landmark human rights decision and ensure the level of funding for Indigenous children is equal to that for other Canadian kids.\n\n\"It's as simple as that,\" said Taman, a lawyer who formerly worked for the Public Prosecution Service of Canada. \"On the specific question of the human rights violation which is a part of the genocide against Indigenous people in our country, it's not good enough, I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe NDP would also invest in safe, healthy, affordable housing, increase money for post-secondary education and improve mental health services for Indigenous people.\n\nCecile Lyall plans to head back home to cast her ballot, and she hopes to encourage others to vote.\n\n\"It's something that I hope continues to gain importance and not just for the Inuit, but Canadians in general. It's very empowering to be able to sit in that booth and really feel like you're making a difference,\" Lyall said.", "description": "More than half of Canada's Indigenous population of more than 1.6 million now lives in urban centres, including more than 42,000 in Ottawa \u2014 and more than ever before, they're voting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5313823.1570565165!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/students-nunavut-sivuniksavut.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
