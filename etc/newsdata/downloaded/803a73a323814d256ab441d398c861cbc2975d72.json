The people should have had a say in it,\" he said.\n\n\"Like everything else this was decided from the top and implemented only by the decision of the prime minister.\"", "description": "A palace that once housed Ethiopia's emperors and also served as a torture site under the communist Derg regime is to open to the public in a controversial...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/19/wire-19552710-1570730872-31_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
