GM wants to freeze a base wage this year for a second year in a row, a plan opposed by its South Korean union which has said it could stage a full strike this month.\n\nRenault Samsung (KS: ), a unit of French automaker Renualt SA (PA: ), also plans to cut production starting next month, with shipments of Nissan's Rogue SUV to the United States to be phased out this year, clouding job prospects.", "description": "Hyundai workers OK smaller bonuses, no strike as Japan dispute weighs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF811I2_L.jpg"}
