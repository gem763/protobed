The notes will be used to refinance medium- to long-term offshore debt, which is due within one year. The notes are rated at the same level as Kaisa's senior unsecured rating as they constitute its direct and senior unsecured obligations. The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 15 October 2019. Kaisa's ratings are underpinned by a strong asset base that supports scale expansion, which is at a level comparable with 'BB' category homebuilders. The company had a large and well-located land bank consisting of 167 projects in 47 cities across five major economic regions at end-1H19. Its geographical diversification mitigates project and region-related risks and gives it more flexibility when launching new projects to support sales growth. Kaisa's ratings are constrained by high leverage - measured by net debt/adjusted inventory (urban renewal projects (URP) and investment properties at original cost) - of 72% at end-1H19, although this is mitigated by high profitability. Fitch believes Kaisa will start deleveraging from 2020, supported by its enlarged scale and increased margin, with more high-margin URPs being recognised. Kaisa is able to secure a large land bank at low cost in China's Greater Bay Area through its URP business, which supports its high EBITDA margin of over 30%. The wider margin of the URP business, at over 40%, will help deleveraging. However, Kaisa's leverage will remain high if it expands its scale at the same pace as in 2017 and 2018, as URPs only contributed 30% of contracted sales in 2018. Key Rating Drivers URPs a Business Strength: Fitch believes Kaisa's URP business offers operational flexibility, as its high profitability enables the company to sustain price cuts in a market downturn. Kaisa can also sell stakes in its URPs, if needed, at a profit because of their low land cost. Kaisa's long experience in the URP business has enabled it to secure a large land bank with a high gross profit margin of over 40%, supporting the company's EBITDA margin, excluding capitalised interest in cost of goods sold (COGS), of 30%-35%. A large URP pipeline of 128 projects, covering a site area of 32 million square metres (sq m), also allows for a consistent stream of projects entering the sales phase. Kaisa has converted an average gross floor area (GFA) of 940,000 sq m a year for the past 10 years; this offers some operational flexibility with land replenishment. Nevertheless, the URP business has limited scope to build scale and will become a less important driver at higher rating levels. URPs require a longer development cycle and thus funds will be trapped for a longer period and incur higher funding without immediate cash flow generation or profit contribution, raising Kaisa's leverage above that of peers without as large an exposure to URPs. The nature of the business and the high profitability mean Kaisa can operate at a higher leverage than other Chinese homebuilders for a sustained period. High Leverage Constrains Ratings: Fitch expects Kaisa's leverage, measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, to stay above 70% in 2019, but to fall below that level thereafter. Kaisa's sales scale in 2019 would be insufficient to cover its high tax and interest burden. Reliance on the non-URP homebuilding business, which has a lower margin, and growth at the business that is faster than we expect, may limit Kaisa's capacity to deleverage. However, we think there may be improvement once the company's attributable sales rise above CNY100 billion from 2020, as its sales efficiency - contracted sales/gross debt - will exceed 0.8x and support stronger fund flow from operation. Large and Premium Land Bank: Fitch believes Kaisa's quality land bank will support its ability to meet its sales target in 2019. Its premium asset base can also buffer liquidity if conversion of its URP land bank takes longer than the company expects, as it can easily find buyers for its well-located URPs, especially in Shenzhen. Kaisa's land bank totalled 25.8 million sq m (estimated sellable resources of CNY501 billion) at end-1H19, of which 14.1 million sq m, or 54.6%, was in the Greater Bay Area and 3.2 million sq m in Shenzhen. Robust Contracted Sales Growth: Fitch thinks Kaisa's 2019 contracted sales target is achievable due to the supportive policies in the Greater Bay Area and the company's well-located land bank. Kaisa had available sellable resources of CNY158 billion at end-2018, implying a sell-through rate of 57% to support a 20% sales growth in 2019, close to its historical sell-through rate of around 60%. Kaisa's attributable contracted sales rose by 34% to CNY55.1 billion in 9M19, supported by an average selling price increase of 4% and GFA growth of 28%. Derivation Summary Kaisa's attributable sales of CNY70 billion in 2018 were comparable with those of 'BB' category peers, such as CIFI Holdings (Group) Co. Ltd. (BB/Stable), Logan Property Holdings Company Limited (BB/Stable) and China Aoyuan Group Limited (BB-/Positive), and exceeded the CNY40 billion-50 billion sales of Yuzhou Properties Company Limited (BB-/Stable), KWG Group Holdings Limited (BB-/Stable) and Times China Holdings Limited (BB-/Stable). Over half of Kaisa's land bank GFA is in the Greater Bay Area, similar to that of Logan, China Aoyuan and Times China. Kaisa's EBITDA margin of over 30% is at the higher end of 'BB' category peers due to its high-margin URPs. Kaisa's leverage of over 70% is similar to that of Oceanwide Holdings Co. Ltd. (B-/Stable), Xinhu Zhongbao Co., Ltd. (B-/Stable) and Tahoe Group Co., Ltd. (B-/Stable). Kaisa's business profile is much stronger than that of Oceanwide and Xinhu, with a larger sales scale and more diversified land bank. Its churn, measured by contracted sales/total debt, of 0.64x is also healthier than the ratios of the two peers, which are below 0.25x. Kaisa and Tahoe, whose land bank is more exposed to the Pan-Bohai Area, the Yangtze River Delta and Fujian province, have similar scale and margin. However, Tahoe's shorter land-bank life of two to three years pressures its leverage and Tahoe's liquidity is much tighter than that of Kaisa. Kaisa's closest peer among 'B' category issuers is Yango Group Co., Ltd. (B+/Stable). Yango's sales of CNY118 billion in 2018 were larger than Kaisa's CNY70 billion and its land bank was also more diversified, although Yango's EBITDA margin, excluding capitalised interest, of around 28% was narrower than Kaisa's more than 30%. Yango's leverage, measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, of below 65% in 2019 is lower than our expectation of Kaisa's leverage. Yango's moderately stronger business and financial profiles justifies the one-notch difference. Key Assumptions Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer - Attributable contracted sales to rise by 20% in 2019 and 2020 - Attributable land premium/contracted sales at 28% in 2019 and 31% in 2020 (2018: 23%) - Cash collection rate of around 80% in 2019 and 85% in 2020 (2018: 75%) - Construction cost/sales proceeds at around 30% in 2019 and 2020 (2018: 30%) - Dividend payout ratio of 20% of net income (2018: 19%) RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Leverage, measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, sustained below 60% - EBITDA margin, excluding capitalised interest in COGS, sustained above 30% Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Leverage, measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, above 75% for a sustained period - EBITDA margin, excluding capitalised interest in COGS, below 25% for a sustained period Liquidity and Debt Structure Cash Meets Short-Term Obligations: Kaisa had cash and cash equivalents of CNY28 billion at end-1H19, including restricted cash of CNY7 billion, against CNY22 billion in short-term debt. The company also had total credit lines of CNY165 billion, of which CNY119 billion was unused. In addition, Kaisa obtained approval from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange to issue four asset-backed securities, consisting of CNY5 billion linked to supply-chain financing (CNY555 million issued), CNY3 billion linked to long-term rental apartments, CNY685 million secured by mortgage balloon payments (issued) and CNY475 million backed by income from its shipping business (issued). Kaisa's average funding cost stayed flat at 8.4% in 2018.
