Reading Show? Here\u2019s a Preview", "language": "en", "text": "The Commerce Department will release its initial estimate of the gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy \u2014 for the third quarter at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nWall Street analysts expect the figures to show that the economy grew at an annual rate of 1.5 percent over the summer, down from 2 percent in the spring.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve are likely to end their two days of meetings in Washington on Wednesday afternoon with an announcement that the central bank will once again drop its benchmark interest rates, a preventive tactic meant to stop a slowdown from turning into a slide.\n\nWhich way is the trend line headed?\n\nThe year started out with a surge as the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.1 percent during the first three months, but the pace of growth declined in the second quarter. If the slowdown continued across June, July and August, it would be the first time in a decade that the growth rate fell for two consecutive quarters. Lydia Boussour, senior United States economist at Oxford Economics , said it was \u201cunusual to have back-to-back retraction outside of a recession.\u201d\n\nTrade frictions and weak global growth are stirring up the greatest unease. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, noted that business investment, chief executives\u2019 confidence, export orders and more were all slowing. \u201cThe trend is not your friend in this data,\u201d he said.\n\nOther analysts, though, emphasized that the economy remained rooted in solid ground. \u201cIf I saw cracks in the consumer sector, I would be worried, but I don\u2019t see that yet,\u201d said Ben Herzon, executive director of United States economics at Macroeconomic Advisers , a forecasting firm. Consumer spending accounts for the largest chunk of G.D.P. by far, and that sector, he said, is in \u201cgood shape.\u201d\n\nUp or down, the G.D.P. report is unlikely to persuade the Fed to swerve away from lowering rates.\n\nBig-name manufacturers hit a rough patch.\n\nEconomic activity suffered somewhat from a strike by workers at General Motors that began in the final two weeks of the quarter, halting production nationwide. Troubles at Boeing, the nation\u2019s largest aerospace manufacturer and its largest manufacturing exporter, have also nibbled away at output. The company\u2019s 737 Max has been grounded after two calamitous crashes, and deliveries of planes coming off the assembly line have largely halted.", "description": "After a slowdown in the spring, economists are watching for further signs of softening in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Patricia Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/business/30econ/30econ-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
