Richardson served about seven years in prison before the true assailant, Matias Reyes, confessed to the crime in 2002.\n\n\u201cI thought that it wasn\u2019t possible that I would ever go (to Syracuse),\" Richardson said Wednesday, \u201cbecause once I got out of prison, I\u2019m no longer at the age to play college basketball.\u201d\n\nThis month, however, Richardson stepped onto the campus as a visitor for the first time and was honored at a reception for a scholarship in his name to help black and Latino students with unmet financial needs. Although he did not get to attend Syracuse himself, the scholarship enables Richardson to leave a legacy there for future generations.\n\n\u2018When They See Us\u2019 tells the important story of the Central Park Five. Here\u2019s what it leaves out.\n\nThe Central Park Five \u2014 now known as the Exonerated Five \u2014 gained renewed attention in the summer after Netflix released \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d a four-part series about the group that was the streaming service\u2019s most-watched series for at least 12 days after its May 31 premiere.\n\nOut of that publicity arose an opportunity: Richardson, 44, mentioned his childhood dream of attending Syracuse during a segment of \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d that aired in June. Suddenly, black and Latino alumni started calling the university to ask what they could do for Richardson.\n\nRachel Vassel, assistant vice president of multicultural advancement, took up the cause. She said she got in touch with Richardson through a mutual acquaintance at the Innocence Project, a nonprofit that seeks to exonerate people who are wrongfully convicted. Richardson told Vassel what had appealed to him about Syracuse, and Vassel built a campus visit around his interests.\n\nArriving on campus Sept. 8, Richardson said, made him feel \u201clike I was 14 years old again\u201d \u2014 the age when he was wrongfully arrested.\n\n\u201cWhen my feet hit the university, it was a bittersweet situation,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it felt great being there initially, and as I was walking around I just thought, \u2018That could have been me here.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018The Central Park Five,\u2019 in song: composer Anthony Davis on his new opera\n\nRichardson participated in a flurry of events over the next two days: a play called \u201cThoughts of a Colored Man,\u201d a visit to the basketball practice facility, and a nearly sold-out panel discussion about criminal justice at which students gave him a standing ovation. Richardson and his wife even got to take photos on the campus\u2019s \u201ckissing bench,\u201d Vassel said.\n\nAt a reception for the university\u2019s Our Time Has Come Scholarship program benefiting black and Latino students, Vassel announced the Kevin Richardson Fund to provide a minimum of two annual scholarships for students with GPAs of at least 2.5. A university alumna contributed $25,000 to start the scholarship, and the university hopes to raise another $75,000. Students who receive the funds also will get leadership training and support while at the university.\n\n\u201cIt means everything to me,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt makes everything that I went through as a teenager up until now \u2014 it makes it worth it.\u201d\n\nTo welcome Richardson into the Syracuse family, Vassel said, the university gave him a trumpet donated by Yamaha, and a custom jersey with his name and No. 44, a retired number worn by some of the university\u2019s greatest athletes.\n\n\u2018When They See Us\u2019 is a powerful, overdue telling of the injustices endured by the Central Park Five\n\nVassel, a New York City native, said she remembered thinking in 1989 that something was amiss when the teenagers who would become the Central Park Five were arrested. The five \u2014 Richardson, Korey Wise, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Antron McCray \u2014 were found guilty on some of the charges in 1990 trials and spent between six and 13 years in detention centers and prisons. Their sentences were later vacated, and the men reached a $41 million settlement with the city.\n\n\u201cI just could relate to him (Richardson) and what his family was going through,\u201d Vassel said. \u201cSo just all these years later, being in a position to host him and give him some joy back and some of what he missed, it was just wonderful.\u201d\n\nThousands of people have signed a petition urging the university to give Richardson an honorary degree. Ellen James Mbuqe, a spokeswoman for Syracuse, in a statement declined to comment directly on whether the university would do so, but pointed out that the university senate is responsible for awarding honorary degrees.\n\nThe university hopes to continue its relationship with Richardson, who lives in New Jersey and advocates for criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be the last time that he\u2019s visited,\u201d Vassel said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the start of our connection to him and his connection to us.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA mistaken text from a stranger led this man to raise money for a sick boy he didn\u2019t know\n\nDetroit has thousands of vacant lots.

Their goal? \u2018A full belly laugh.\u2019\n\nAlabama restaurant has no prices on the menu, just a box for diners to drop in any amount they want", "description": "Kevin Richardson's hopes to attend the university were dashed when he was wrongfully locked up.
