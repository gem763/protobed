Kasich come out for impeachment of Donald Trump", "language": "en", "text": "Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who fought Donald Trump to the bitter end in the 2016 Republican nomination fight, says he now supports impeaching the president.\n\nKasich said on CNN that the 'final straw' for him was when acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged Thursday that Trump's decision to hold up military aid to Ukraine was linked to his demand that Kiev investigate the Democratic National Committee and the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nMulvaney in a stunning televised briefing said he held up the money to leverage the foreign investigation that President Trump told him he wanted, then claimed the press misconstrued his remarks and said he never said there was a quid-pro-quo.\n\n'Did (Trump) also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely... That's it. That's why we held up the money,' Mulvaney said.\n\n'The last 24 hours has really forced me to review all of this,' speaking hours after Mulvaney's extraordinary walk-back.\n\nFormer Ohio Gov. Kasich came out for impeachment of President Donald Trump on Friday, and cited the televised admissions by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, which Mulvaney tried to walk back Thursday\n\n'Withholding military aid, vital military aid to a nation like Ukraine, which has Russian troops inside its territory, that\u2019s threatened all the time, withholding it so that a political operation can take place \u2013 'investigate this thing around the server, and we\u2019re going to withhold the aid until you do that\u2019 \u2013 to me, it's totally inappropriate. It\u2019s an abuse of power,' Kasich said.\n\nJust 10 days ago, Kasich, who has not ruled out a 2020 run against Trump, was holding the line against impeachment.\n\nHe reviewed Trump's July 25 call with the head of Ukraine, where Trump asked for a 'favor,' and brought up the Democratic National Committee's server from 2016 as well as the Bidens, though Trump himself didn't tie it to $390 million in aid for Ukraine that Mulvaney was holding up at the time.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waves after stepping off Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, early Friday, Oct. 18, 2019, in Washington.

And that is absolutely appropriate,' said Mulvaney, confirming that the president ordered $390 million in Ukraine held up over the probe of the U.S. elections\n\nHOW MICK TRIED TO CHANGE HIS STORY (AFTER DEMOCRATS SAID THEY'D QUESTION HIM TOO) On camera early afternoon 'Did he also mention to me in that the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it. And that's why we held up the money. 'We do that all the time with foreign policy.' 'I have news for everybody: Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.' In a White House issued statement 'The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainian military aid any investigation into the 2016 election. 'The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. 'The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.'\n\n'In reading that transcript, I did not see a clear quid pro quo,' Kasich told CNN October 8.\n\n'If you have an impeachment that doesn't bring the Republicans along, and this is done strictly along party line votes, this is going to end up not helping this country,' said Kasich, who voted to impeach President Bill Clinton as a House member in 1998.\n\nCongress is conducting an impeachment inquiry sparked by a whistleblower's allegation that Trump pressed the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on political rival Joe Biden as he delayed military aid to the country.\n\nKasich also mentioned the resignation that Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced this week. Perry said he never discussed a Ukrainian company linked to Joe Biden's son Hunter in his own dealings, and said he had no problem with the president asking him to coordinate activities with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\n'When I look at all the information that is coming to us, and all the craziness that is surrounding the operation of the White House, now the resignation sometime this year of Secretary Perry and his involvement, it just goes on and on and on and on,' said Kasich.\n\nThe occasional CNN commentator told the network: 'I fought with people on the air about 'Is there a quid-pro-quo?' and 'Does this rise to the level of impeachment?' I now believe that it does.'\n\n'At this point, there is a big cloud and I think it has to be cleared.'\n\nKasich's turnaround comes after another failed GOP presidential candidate, 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, denounced Trump's Syria policy in a Senate floor speech.", "description": "Kasich, who fought Donald Trump to the bitter end in the 2016 Republican nomination fight,\u00a0said Mick Mulvaney admitting holding up aid for a Ukraine investigation was the final straw.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/20/wire-19900102-1571426343-689_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
