Once a dependable goalkeeper, he made several high-profile errors towards the end of last season and was criticised for his role in Crystal Palace\u2019s late winner at Old Trafford last month.\n\n\u201cWhenever he concedes a goal, it's headlines that he should have saved [it],\u201d Solskjaer said on Friday, before Leicester City\u2019s visit. \u201cThat's just the way it is at Man United and you have to handle it. You have to be resilient, you've got to have robust confidence, and he's fine. I don't worry about him at all.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

David's never, ever said anything else to me, other that he loves this club, he wants to stay here and he's had a fantastic time, so let's hope we just get it over the line.\u201d\n\nIf Solskjaer's confidence is misplaced and United do lose De Gea for nothing, they will need a replacement of the same calibre. Sergio Romero is currently United's reserve 'keeper ahead of third-choice Lee Grant, while the promising England Under-21 international Dean Henderson is spending a second year on loan at Sheffield United.\n\nJan Oblak and Jordan Pickford have both previously been linked as potential successors to De Gea, but Solskjaer suggested on Friday that United\u2019s efforts were concentrated on convincing their current No 1 to stay rather than searching for alternatives.\n\n\u201cWe are always aware of what\u2019s happening around in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my focus and the club\u2019s focus is to convince him to stay. He can see what we\u2019re doing, and knows what we\u2019re doing. We want players here, the best ones, and the ones we want most of the time stay. There are not many who we want to keep that we don\u2019t manage to keep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have two very good backup keepers with Sergio and Lee. Dean is playing at Sheffield United. So the goalkeeping department is in good health. And I said I am confident we will manage to convince David that here is the future for him. And it is a successful future, a club that wants to get back to winning trophies.\u201d", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is \u201cpretty confident\u201d that David de Gea will commit his future to Manchester United\u00a0and is not currently looking at alternatives to replace him, despite protracted talks over a new contract.
