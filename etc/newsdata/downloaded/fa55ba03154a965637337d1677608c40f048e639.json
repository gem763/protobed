(Photo: Roy Rochlin/Getty Images)\n\nRemember Shriek? You might not; the character, debuting in Marvel Comics in 1993, was created to be a love interest for Cletus Kassidy, aka Carnage. She\u2019s a mutant with sound-manipulation abilities and a deep love for both killing and Carnage. And now we know who might be playing her in the Venom sequel.\n\nAccording to an exclusive report from Variety, the villainess will be making her film debut in Venom 2, with actress Naomie Harris (Moonlight) in talks to play her. If she appears, she\u2019ll be showing up alongside Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson, playing Venom and Carnage respectively, with Andy Serkis directing.\n\nMy curiosity here is how they\u2019re going to adapt Shriek. As she stands, she\u2019s perfect \u201890s excess, a jumble of powers and skimpy clothes brought together just so Carnage has someone to murder a whole bunch of people alongside. Are they going to make her a symbiote character, perhaps drawing from the myriad of symbiote-adjacent lore out in the nether regions of canon? Or are they just going to go with Black Canary, but evil? Both sound campy and bad, and thus I\u2019m into it.\n\nVenom 2 has no official release date, though many speculate it\u2019ll be next year.", "description": "Remember Shriek?
