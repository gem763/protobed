The 69.3% stake is worth about $2.9 billion.\n\n\"I'm saying very clearly that when such a thing happens on the market... then Polish financial institutions should be interested,\" Kwiecinski told reporters.\n\nPoland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has tightened control over the country's banking sector and signalled a desire to increase domestic ownership.\n\nThe state and Polish investors control 59.2% of the local banking market following the state's purchase in 2017 of Pekao SA from UniCredit.\n\nAnalysts and Polish bank CEOs have predicted more consolidation among the country's banks, where low interest rates are making it tough for smaller players to compete.\n\nAnalysts have said that the mBank deal will potentially be attractive to foreign banks that already have a presence in Poland, such as Santander, ING, BCP, and BNP Paribas, as well as banks with no presence in Poland.\n\nBut potential foreign predators will face competition from Polish state-run institutions such as PKO BP, PZU and Pekao SA.\n\nLast month, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he was in favour of increasing Polish ownership in reference to the mBank sale, but also said any decision to buy Commerzbank's stake should be taken on business grounds.\n\n(Writing by Marcin Goclowski.
