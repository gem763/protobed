Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare\", Musk wrote in the tweet from last year.\n\nThe tweet amounted to \"threatening employees\" with loss of stock options if they vote in favour of the union, the judge said in her ruling on Friday.\n\nThe ruling has called on the electric carmaker to hold a meeting at its California assembly plant where either Musk or his agent must inform the workers that the National Labor Relations Board has concluded that Tesla broke the law.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Friday's ruling.\n\nIn the past, the company has been plagued by safety complaints brought by workers, allegations that Tesla denies. Workers have said that long hours and pressure to deliver vehicles quickly takes a toll, and some have pushed for a union.", "description": "U.S. labour judge rules that Tesla broke labour law", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8R001_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
