The system will feature a new controller with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to \u201cdeepen the feeling of immersion\u201d for players.\n\n\u201cWith haptics, you truly feel a broader range of feedback, so crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field. You can even get a sense for a variety of textures,\u201d Sony Interactive Entertainment president Jim Ryan said in a release.\n\nIn addition, adaptive triggers offer different levels of resistance that allow players to experience tactile sensations, such as drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating a vehicle.\n\nWired confirmed the PS5 will have a CPU based on AMD\u2019s Ryzen line and a GPU based on its Navi family, along with a solid-state drive. The console\u2019s ability to support ray-tracing is based in its hardware, and not a software-level fix.\n\n\u201cThere is ray-tracing acceleration in the GPU hardware, which I believe is the statement that people were looking for,\u201d system architect Mark Cerny said.\n\nMicrosoft also has a next-generation console, nicknamed Project Scarlett, in the works. The system will also debut during the 2020 holiday season, alongside Halo Infinite.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 PlayStation 5 launches holiday 2020: https://t.co/VuaxUVoBaR #PS5 pic.twitter.com/MPkKyRaHio\u2014 PlayStation (@PlayStation)", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
