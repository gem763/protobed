He also noted that it's seen high consumer demand following its introduction and that Goldman has handled sign-ups effectively and avoided weakening its underwriting standards. The latter is particularly important considering Apple Card is reportedly approving subprime users. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe card's early success may mean it's set to boost Apple Pay's popularity. Apple Card's main cash-back offerings entice cardholders to make purchases via Apple Pay since they receive 2% cash back on all purchases that use the mobile wallet, 3% back on Apple Pay transactions with select merchants, and just 1% on payments that use Apple Card's physical companion card.\n\nThis should lead cardholders to use Apple Pay more regularly, which is valuable for Apple considering adoption of the payment method has been low in the US: Just 9% of US consumers used Apple Pay in 2019, while 17% of consumers did in China even though Apple Pay has to contend with the likes of Alipay and WeChat Pay in the market. This means that Apple Card's reportedly successful launch could set Apple Pay up to see its adoption and usage rise quickly in the US.\n\nPotential antitrust concerns surrounding Apple and Apple Pay could make it harder for the mobile wallet to drive adoption, but Apple Card could safeguard against any negative impact. The European Commission is looking into whether Apple favors its mobile wallet, which could lead to regulation that limits Apple's ability to push consumers to use Apple Pay. Apple Pay's competitors are complaining that iPhones don't allow consumers to use other payment options within the wallet and that iPhones promote Apple Pay to users, per Bloomberg as cited by Seeking Alpha.\n\nThe complaint about enabling other payment methods from its wallet may be particularly problematic for Apple because it doesn't allow other services to access its phones' NFC hardware, while Google does. In response, the Commission has reportedly sent out a questionnaire to various payments stakeholders.\n\nIf it takes issue with Apple's practices, it could lessen the firm's ability to drive Apple Pay usage by limiting what kind of promotions it can do and requiring it to allow other payments firms to enable NFC-based payments from the iPhone wallet, as two examples. Australian banks previously pushed for the latter but their request was rejected by Australia's competition regulator, though the direct involvement of the Commission, in this case, could make different results more likely.\n\nIf Apple's required to stop favoring Apple Pay, Apple Card can ensure consumers still use the wallet, making its adoption extremely important. Once consumers sign up for Apple Card, they'll likely use Apple Pay more, limiting the impact of Apple having to enable NFC payments from third parties on iPhones and no longer highlighting Apple Pay.\n\nThis could make Apple Card's reported early success extremely valuable, and should make furthering its adoption a priority for Apple going forward, which means it may want to accelerate any plans it has to expand to Europe, something it's reportedly looked into.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
