If the money was going to be the same in Brown\u2019s contract extension, if the compensation sent to the Steelers was going to be the same, then it was an easy call for Brown\u2019s camp.\n\n\n\nIn a perfect world, he\u2019d be a New England Patriot. And now, thanks to an absurdly imperfect five months, he finally is.\n\n\n\nWhy it didn\u2019t happen last March was simple. According to a source familiar with New England\u2019s interest in Brown last spring \u2013 including the talks between the Steelers and Patriots \u2013 it came down to this: Pittsburgh didn\u2019t want Brown in New England. The Steelers knew they\u2019d likely have to grapple with the Patriots in the 2019 playoff picture. Beyond that, there was already bitter feelings born out of competition between the two teams (not to mention the whole LeGarrette Blount fiasco in 2014). Sending Brown into the arms of the Patriots and Bill Belichick would not only be costly to Pittsburgh\u2019s own playoff chances, it would border on humiliating. Especially if the deal wasn\u2019t for a significant package in return. It would mean waving the white flag to all the parties the Steelers simply didn\u2019t want to surrender to. From Brown to Bill Belichick to Tom Brady.\n\n\u201cPittsburgh just wasn\u2019t going to do it,\u201d said a source familiar with the Patriots\u2019 pursuit of Brown. \u201cIt was never going to happen. No matter what [agent Drew Rosenhaus] thought or whoever else, there was no way the Steelers were sending him to New England.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\n\n\nBut the Raiders? They weren\u2019t a threat. There was no animus there. And it was a franchise in a rebuild. Seeing Oakland and Brown in the playoffs was a slim chance. This was the smart move \u2013 and Pittsburgh took it. Five months later, with Brown being cut by the Raiders and signing with the Patriots, Pittsburgh is suddenly staring at precisely what it didn\u2019t want to happen. Living a completely unexpected version of a nightmare that it tried to avoid.\n\nAntonio Brown had his eyes on the Patriots earlier this year. (AP)\n\nBill Belichick \u2018won\u2019t handle Antonio the way Jon Gruden did\u2019\n\nHow could two franchises get completely turned on their ears in just five months? And why the hell would the Patriots \u2013 a supposedly consummate \u201cTeam Before Player\u201d organization \u2013 continue to pursue arguably the league\u2019s biggest \u201cPlayer Before Team\u201d reputation? Well, it\u2019s pretty basic.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause Bill respects the s - - - out of the talent,\u201d said a source close to Belichick. \u201cThat\u2019s why he wanted Antonio Brown in the first place. He also won\u2019t handle Antonio the way Jon Gruden did. Bill is working with six Super Bowl rings. He\u2019s not going to put up with anything. Nothing. He does not care. He\u2019ll tell that to Antonio from the start, too. He\u2019ll confront him and tell him the truth. If Antonio becomes a problem, he\u2019ll be gone. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, that might be the ultimate \u201cout\u201d for the Patriots, by not being bound to Brown further than tomorrow. By making it known to Brown that the organization respects his talent but also expects his conformity to the mission. The same way it did with Randy Moss and Corey Dillon and Chad Johnson and Albert Haynesworth. Sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t. But the Patriots will be ready to eject whenever they feel it\u2019s necessary.\n\n\n\nBelichick could care less about anything that happened with Brown before the second he stepped into the Patriots franchise. If he can help New England win, great. If he can\u2019t, he\u2019ll be gone. That\u2019s a simple calculus. Especially when the math hasn\u2019t gotten exponentially more reliable at the wide receiver position. Sure, Josh Gordon has been reinstated. Relying on him is a week-to-week proposition because history has shown that it has to be that way. Julian Edelman is Julian Edelman. N\u2019Keal Harry is a rookie and his health has already inhibited high expectations of an impact.\n\n\n\nBut you add Brown into the mix? That\u2019s a no-brainer because not a whole lot has changed about why the Patriots liked him back in March. If anything, the Patriots have a reason to like him more now because they may get a more committed player for even less risk than last spring. Just a contract that will surely have protections and absolutely zero draft compensation. And with a message Brown should be hearing crystal clear right now:\n\n\n\nWelcome to the team. You\u2019re completely expendable, but we\u2019d like to do great things with you. Do things our way and everything will work out. Direct any concerns to our trophy room.\n\nTom Brady and Antonio Brown share a word after a 2016 game. (AP)\n\nBrown could get last laugh in this circus\n\nIt\u2019s possible Brown will be completely on message with the Patriots. Particularly knowing that this is a relationship that has to last for only five months for everyone to reap massive wins. Not just for the Patriots to get another Super Bowl, but for Brown to stick it to everyone in the process, from Mike Mayock and the Raiders, to Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers, and everyone in between who criticized him since the unceremonious end of the 2018 season.\n\n\n\nOf course, something like that would drive the \u201cno single player before the entire team\u201d crowd insane. Only because it would mean Brown ultimately forced his way off two teams in six months and came out with at least some measure of victory. Here\u2019s the thing: New England doesn\u2019t care because New England isn\u2019t the fool in this story. The Patriots have already won. The Raiders are wearing a dunce cap. The Steelers look like they just got gamed despite their best efforts. All while the Patriots get to test-drive Brown without any real worries about repercussions. Even if it doesn\u2019t work out, the pages of history will say it was a Brown problem, not a Patriots problem.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us back to Brown\u2019s place in this. He won a partial victory. No matter what your opinion is of how he achieved it, he\u2019s coming out of this on a better team and with a better quarterback. It\u2019s not a total victory, mind you. Brown still forfeited at least $14 million in guaranteed money \u2013 even in a best-case scenario for the 2019 season. Could he eventually win that money back down the line? Yes. One more deal in 2020 would likely do exactly that. But he isn\u2019t there yet. And the risk right now is pretty much all on him.\n\n\n\nThe flip side: He has put himself in position to gain everything back and maybe more. After all, nothing reinvents a damaged reputation more quickly than success. And no team has shown the ability to remake the memory of a player more than the Patriots. We forget what the narrative was around Randy Moss before he went to the Patriots. The same with Dillon. Here\u2019s a refresher: It was a whole lot of bad. Mountains of criticism. And to go back to Blount, the guy\u2019s career was basically saved by New England twice.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s precisely why this isn\u2019t just a no-brainer for the Patriots. It\u2019s the most obvious choice for Brown, too. And maybe it was always the right choice for him. Maybe this is the union that truly would have been the right match back in March. A marriage that might have altered the timeline of the past five months.\n\n\n\nNone of that matters now. Brown fought his way off two teams and found a more perfect world through a totally imperfect path. Critics can scream all they want. New England could care less. This was, is and will always be about winning. And that\u2019s the only program Antonio Brown needs to get with to make the next five months work for everyone.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Brown fought his way off two teams and found a more perfect world through a totally imperfect path.
