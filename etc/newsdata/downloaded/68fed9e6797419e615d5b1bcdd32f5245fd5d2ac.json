Various accounts have told of his death in the past, only for him to surface yet again.\n\nWHO'S LEADING ISIS NOW THAT AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD?\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much left,\u201d President Trump said of al-Baghdadi\u2019s remains during a Sunday morning news conference following the raid, \u201cbut there are still substantial pieces that they brought back.\u201d\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s head remained intact following the blast, allowing commandos to use biometrics, specifically facial recognition, to immediately identify him, Fox News National Correspondent Jennifer Griffin reported.\n\nBiometrics is a method of authenticating a person\u2019s ID that uses human features such as fingerprints, facial recognition or other physical characteristics.\n\nU.S. forces can use an image taken of a terrorist or suspect to search databases of photos the military has built up over time to match the individual\u2019s identity, according to the Army Times.\n\nAL-BAGHDADI KILL: HOW THE DARING MILITARY OPERATION WENT DOWN\n\nBut the soldiers didn\u2019t just rely on biometric analysis.\n\nTrump said they had brought along samples of al-Baghdadi\u2019s DNA. It was unclear how they obtained the ISIS leader's DNA, but a U.S. official told The Washington Post on condition of anonymity that it was voluntarily provided by one of his own daughters.\n\n\u201cThey did an onsite test because we had to know this,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd it was a very quick call that took place about 15 minutes after he was killed, and it was positive.\u201d\n\n\"It was him,\" Trump declared.\n\nTRUMP DEFENDS KEEPING 'LEAKER' SCHIFF, PELOSI OUT OF THE LOOP ON AL-BAGHDADI RAID\n\nAfter Navy Seals killed Al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, it took eight hours to make a positive identification through DNA analysis, The Washington Post reported in 2013, citing a top-secret U.S. intelligence document. Samples of the terrorist's remains had to be physically taken to a U.S. military DNA lab in Afghanistan to provide a conclusive match.\n\nSince then, advances in technology have allowed for so-called on-the-spot DNA testing, which dramatically cuts down the processing time for results.\n\nIn 2015, SOCOM revealed the use of new types of portable DNA labs that could produce results in just 90 minutes rather than weeks of waiting, Defense News reported at the time. The devices at the time weighed about 120 to 200 pounds and cost about $250,000 each.\n\n\"It's a groundbreaking, game-breaking technology,\" Michael Fitz, SOCOM's program manager for sensitive site exploitation, told the outlet at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe hoped that advances in technology could soon produce smaller, lightweight devices.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what type of devices were used during the al-Baghdadi raid to positively identify the ISIS leader.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "After years of intelligence gathering, U.S. Special Operation Forces could have no doubts that the mutilated body of a man killed during Saturday night\u2019s daring raid in Syria was the long-sought Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, employing new technology and DNA testing to positively identify his headless remains almost immediately.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/al-baghdadi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
