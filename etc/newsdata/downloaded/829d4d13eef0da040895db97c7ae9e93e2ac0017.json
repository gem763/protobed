I\n\nt means that if they are dressing show homes that are being viewed by potential buyers in the summer, they will choose flowers that are in bloom at that point in the calendar.\n\nEverything is then brought together on site to reflect the brief set out by the client, which range from the private homeowner of a \u00a3600,000 flat to an established developer with a \u00a330million mansion project.\n\nLaura Leadbetter, also a senior interior designer at Alexander James, added: 'Design is a collaboration and is a sign of a good designer who is able to listen.'\n\nThe scheme at the development in Ascot that we visited highlighted these three tips below that can be used in your own home.\n\nThey cover using chandeliers in the bathroom, bold wallpaper prints on a feature bedroom wall and grouping accessories in old numbers.\n\nIncorporating these tips into your own well thought out scheme will pay dividends when it is completed, and reveal a designer touch to your own living space.\n\nGo bold with bathroom lights\n\nFor most people a bathroom light is a largely functional endevour, but the designers recommend not being afraid to use bold lighting in bathrooms, such as this chandelier.\n\nAny lighting used in a bathroom will need to have the correct 'IP rating'. This would be a rating of IP65 for lighting placed directly above a bath or basin, meaning that the light is completely water resistant.\n\nThe bathroom light used in the Ascot development is by Tigermoth.\n\nThe team at Alexander James advise not being afraid of using chandelier lighting in bathrooms\n\nUse patterned wallpaper to match the room's scale\n\nThe designers recommend using wallpapers with large patterns that match the scale of the room where it is being used.\n\nIn the Ascot development, the designers used wallpaper in the guest bedroom called Willow Song, which is by Zoffany.\n\nThe designers explained how they then used large scale bedside lamps and furniture pieces with this wallpaper.\n\nDesigner tip: Use wallpapers with large patterns that match the scale of the room\n\nThink about and group accessories together\n\nAnd finally, the designers recommend grouping accessories in complimentary colours and using items of varied height.\n\nThey also suggest grouping accessories in odd numbers, such as in groups of three or five.\n\nOdd one out: Group accessories in odd numbers, such as in groups of three or five", "description": "We spent a day with one of the world's top 100 interior designers, Alexander James Interior Design, to learn about its tricks and how they can be incorporated into your own home.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19390152-0-image-a-5_1570443559426.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
