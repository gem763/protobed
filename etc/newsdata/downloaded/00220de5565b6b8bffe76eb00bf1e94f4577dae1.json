USA TODAY\n\nAmid backlash from controversial calls made in Monday night\u2019s Green Bay Packers victory over the Detroit Lions, the NFL acknowledged that it erred in enforcing an illegal hands to the face foul against Lions defensive end Trey Flowers.\n\n\u201cThere was one that was clear, that we support,\u201d NFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent told reporters, referring to a prior penalty. \u201cBut there was another that when you look at it and you review the play, it\u2019s not something that you want to see called in that particular pass rush. One you can support, but the other one, when you review it and you have seen some slow-mos, the foul wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nThough Flowers had been called for another illegal hands to the face foul earlier in the fourth quarter, Vincent said the error came on the one in the final minutes. Flowers, according to the ESPN Monday Night Football broadcast, had never been penalized for illegal hands to the face in his career.\n\nWith 1:45 left to play in the game, the Packers faced a two-point deficit and a third-and-4 from the Lions\u2019 16-yard line. Aaron Rodgers\u2019 pass to receiver Jake Kumerow fell incomplete, setting up a short field goal attempt that, had it been converted, would have given Detroit the ball with enough time to get into field goal position to potentially win the game.\n\nNFL power rankings: Texans rocket into top five, while Cowboys tumble from top half\n\nFlowers, though, was called for an illegal hands to the face foul that set up a first down. Replays appeared to show that Flowers had his left hand gripped around the shoulder area of Packers offensive tackle David Bakhtiari.\n\nSince Detroit had burned all of its timeouts, the Packers could then drain the clock before kicker Mason Crosby connected on a game-winning 23-yard kick as time expired.\n\nVincent said he has not spoken to anyone from the Detroit Lions but that he planned to do so.\n\nThe NFL also addressed the status of the new rule that allows coaches to challenge instances of pass interference in \u201cclear and obvious\u201d instances when the rule was not applied. The rule change has been met with criticism after only one challenge has been overturned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we would give a summation on whether a rule that has been in place for six weeks is working or not working,\u201d Falcons president Rich McKay, chairman of the NFL competition committee, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cLet\u2019s let the season play out.\u201d\n\nMcKay cited the implementation of the use of helmet rule to initiate contact from last season.\n\n\u201cThis is a brand new rule, one that our coaches are getting accustomed to, one that our players and our fans are getting accustomed to, and one that the officials are getting accustomed to,\u201d McKay said of the challenge to pass interference. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought it\u2019s way better to reserve judgment until the end of the season is over and have seen the full season and have had the opportunity to look at the full tape, which is what we always do.\u201d\n\nMcKay acknowledged that when the rule was passed in March, the competition committee \u201cknew there was going to be disagreement\u201d about the application of the rule.\n\nThe NFL is holding its fall owners meetings in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "After replays caught an apparent mistake by NFL officials in the Lions-Packers game, Troy Vincent admitted it was wrong to enforce a late penalty.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
