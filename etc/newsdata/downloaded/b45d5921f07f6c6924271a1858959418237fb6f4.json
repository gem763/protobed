Experts weigh in.", "language": "en", "text": "Reign Disick, the youngest son of reality star and businesswoman Kourtney Kardashian and her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, is no stranger to being in the spotlight. But while out on a recent trip to Armenia, the spirited four year old decided to stick his middle finger out to the cameras following him and his family \u2014 and, in true Keeping Up with the Kardashians style, the moment was caught on video. The post, originally shared and captured by fan account @cutiekardashians, has quickly caught the attention of fans and beyond and has left some wondering: is this sort of behavior just fine from a young child?\n\nOn the one hand, several folks on Twitter are claiming Reign is simply put: A Mood.\n\nI do not keep up with The Kardashians. However, Reign Disick is a whollllle moood ! pic.twitter.com/Don7H2eSBm \u2014 laura \ud83e\udd95 (@highimlola) October 10, 2019\n\nTwitter user @highimlola said, \u201cI do not keep up with The Kardashians. However, Reign Disick is a whollllle moood !\u201d while Twitter user @abastron added that he was not only a \u201cwhole ass mood\u201d but included the hashtag #FlipItLikeDisick.\n\nTwitter user @layla_nav said of the child\u2019s potentially crude action, \u201creign disick is me in baby form,\u201d and Twitter user @perrijtx simply thought the video was hilarious, tweeting, \u201cthat video of reign disick w his middle finger up has actually floored me.\u201d\n\nBut some folks over on Instagram are having somewhat of an opposite reaction after the video was posted over on IG page @officialKenBarbie.\n\nInstagram user @kellykj605 commented, \u201cShe better discipline those kids.\u201d Another user, @maydwell_, referred to the child as \u201cbad bad,\u201d adding that they have two kids who don\u2019t do that, \u201cthank god.\u201d\n\nInstagrammer @cravee_onnaa said they thought Kourtney\u2019s kids are \u201couta control,\u201d and Instagram user @beefyboystyle added, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why her dumb is getting sued as soon as her bad ass Kids hit the wrong person.\u201d Apparently the Instagram community is a bit less forgiving (among other things).\n\nNow obviously, Reign has witnessed many people flip the bird, including his own family. And the child has clearly grown up seeing cameras flashing in his and his parents\u2019 direction, so he must understand the basics of a constant invasion of privacy and how frustrating it can be.\n\nMary Lou Harwood, a retired school psychologist in Massachusetts, doesn\u2019t see what the big deal is, though, especially since he\u2019s only four.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s heard that the paparazzi are not his family\u2019s friends. \u2018They are harassing my mom so I can tell them to bugger off,\u2019\u201d Harwood says of the young boy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably more appropriate than having an adult chase you around sticking a camera in your face,\u201d she adds.\n\nShivani Seth, a children\u2019s behavioral health clinician who now focuses on writing, says it simply looks like the young boy is testing boundaries.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a smile on his face and he looks relaxed. He may just be seeing what happens, which is totally normal for the age,\u201d says Seth, adding it wouldn\u2019t be anything that would require clinical intervention.\n\n\u201cPaparazzi are weird and kids can pick up when things are uncomfortable. Did he learn it somewhere? Probably. But it\u2019s not an aggressive act,\u201d explains Seth.\n\nHarwood agrees: \u201cFlipping someone off is relatively nonviolent. I would have to ask how much respect does the paparazzi deserve.\u201d\n\nFor Harwood, context is everything. Flipping off the paparazzi is one thing. Doing it in school is another.\n\n\u201c(Then) the question for me would be, was he provoked? I might ask him to apologize if it was his principal. But I really don\u2019t think his behavior is indicative of anything,\u201d says Harwood.\n\nFor now, Reign will probably keep on reigning in his own way in the Disick-Kardashian world. And as for flipping off people who harass his parents for pay, in this case I\u2019d say the kid is alright.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "While out on a recent trip to Armenia, Reign Disick, 4, decided to stick his middle finger out to the cameras following him and his family", "authors": ["Priscilla Blossom"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wjAHaURow0wFgQWv3ottSA--~B/aD02MTQ7dz0xMTE4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/4fd71390-eba4-11e9-b97f-d90248ad483c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
