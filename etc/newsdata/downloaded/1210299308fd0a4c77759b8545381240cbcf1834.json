Similarly, it seems the way to Reddit\u2019s ire is also through a man\u2019s stomach.\n\nAn anonymous man who identifies as both a vegetarian and a person who can\u2019t cook has taken to Reddit to solicit the advice of other anonymous users about whether or not he is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to make her favorite time-consuming comfort food because she won\u2019t have the energy to make him a special meat-free meal.\n\nPANERA BREAD EMPLOYEE WHO POSTED TIKTOK VIDEO 'EXPOSING' HOW MAC AND CHEESE IS PREPARED WAS FIRED\n\nSpoiler alert: He is, at least according to Reddit.\n\nThe man begins the post by stating he has been with his wife for four years. Though the man has been a vegetarian for a decade, he writes that his wife eats meat, though not as much as she used to because of their fixed budget.\n\nAttempting to earn favor with Reddit, the anonymous man shares that he has bought salami and Italian sausages for his wife in the past, if she was having a craving.\n\nHowever, he goes on to write that \u201cit\u2019s been cold and rainy all week\u201d in the Northeast where the pair live, and his wife has been \u201ctalking about wanting to cook her favorite cold-weather food, Ina Garten\u2019s Bolognese recipe.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something she used to love when her mom made it for her, and she has not made it much since because it can be expensive to make and is labor-intensive,\u201d he writes.\n\n\"I asked her then what she was going to make for me if she was going to make this big elaborate meal for herself, and she got defensive and said, \u2018You can\u2019t cook for yourself tonight?\u2019 in a rude tone\" \u2014 - Reddit user\n\nThe man goes on to say he is grocery shopping and his wife gave him a list of what to pick up for the meat sauce, writing that his wife will usually make a meatless version for him.\n\n\u201cTypically, if she\u2019s making something with meat, she will make a separate batch of the same food, just vegetarian-friendly, or make me a separate meal. I can\u2019t really cook much, so when she doesn\u2019t cook for me I will gravitate toward frozen or canned food, or sandwiches.\u201d\n\nHowever, he learns his wife, who evidently has endometriosis and was currently experiencing a flare-up, is feeling too ill to make two batches of the recipe, which \u201crequires a lot of work, care, and timing.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI asked her if it was possible to just leave the meat out until the end, but according to her it was not, and it was important for the meat to cook with the tomatoes and wine. I asked her then what she was going to make for me if she was going to make this big elaborate meal for herself, and she got defensive and said, \u2018You can\u2019t cook for yourself tonight?\u2019 in a rude tone,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe man claims he \u201cargued calmly\u201d that he felt he was \u201cbeing cheated out of a nice meal.\u201d\n\nPushing the issue further, he claims his wife began crying and asked him why he was being \u201cdifficult about this when she wasn\u2019t feeling well and just wanted to do something that made her happy.\u201d\n\nReddit had the same question when it weighed in on the matter, with the majority declaring the man to be wrong.\n\n\u201cDude. You're a whole grown-up. It's time to learn how to cook,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t cook = won\u2019t. This fool suuuuuuuuuucks,\u201d another person wrote.\n\n\u201cI am seeing what you guys are saying, I should probably apologize to her, but is it not at least a little [bit both of our faults]?\u201d \u2014 - Reddit user\n\n\u201cShe cooks for you guys every day, she wants something she likes just once. She's not even asking you to make it \u2026 you are stopping her from doing something for herself, you gigantic a--h---,\u201d another commented.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s your wife not your mother, and you\u2019re not a child. You already said she doesn\u2019t feel well and she\u2019s trying to make a comfort meal for herself,\" one added. \"It is incredibly self-centered and selfish to ask her not to make her favorite meal.\"\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nAfter the overwhelming response, the man updated his post, and at first seemed to realize the error of his ways, saying he should apologize to his wife. But then, he began trying to reason that maybe \"ESH\" \u2014 or \u201ceveryone sucks here,\u201d referring to himself and his wife both being at fault.\n\n\u201cI am seeing what you guys are saying, I should probably apologize to her, but is it not at least a little esh?\u201d\n\nReddit did not seem to agree with the update, either.", "description": "An anonymous man who identifies as both a vegetarian and a person who can\u2019t cook has taken to Reddit to solicit the advice of other anonymous users.", "authors": ["Alexandra Deabler", "- Reddit User", "Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer", "Editor For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/iStock-Bolognese.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
