Before leaving, don\u2019t forget this money move", "language": "en", "text": "Americans change jobs a lot \u2014 more than a dozen times over a career.\n\nA new opportunity beckons, across town or across the country. Cake is consumed and co-workers hand you a card scrawled with cheerful goodbyes. Your boss says she\u2019ll miss you but wishes you well.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. Except there\u2019s one more thing you should do before the hustle and bustle of moving to your new job begins. Immediately open an IRA.\n\nWhy an IRA? Simple. It\u2019s a low-cost way to save a lot of money for retirement.\n\nIndividual retirement accounts have been around since 1974. The idea is to give people a way to maintain the tax breaks of a former employer\u2019s retirement plan. If your next job doesn\u2019t have a 401(k), no problem \u2014 contribute to an IRA in your own name instead.\n\nYou could choose instead to roll your old 401(k) into a new plan at your next job. The problem with that idea is that most 401(k) plans are unnecessarily expensive. BrightScope, a company which analyzes 401(k) plans, found that people at small firms paid twice as much as people at large firms for their 401(k) plan.\n\nFor instance, a person with $50,000 in a 401(k) with a plan fee of 2% pays $1,000 a year. In comparison, a plan fee of 1% \u2014 typical at large companies \u2014 costs that person just $500 a year.\n\nRead: These are the best new ideas in retirement\n\nCompounding cost\n\nAs your retirement plan balance goes up over time, so does your cost of being in the plan. A near-retiree with $250,000 in a high-fee 401(k) plan shells out $5,000 a year for exactly the same service as a first-year associate.\n\nOpening an IRA and rolling over your 401(k) balance allows you to dramatically reduce your costs. Instead of paying a plan administrator at your old job, you get an IRA in your name at a brokerage firm such as Fidelity or Schwab. Once you\u2019re in, account fees fall to zero.\n\nIncreasingly, too, it\u2019s easy to invest using very low-cost index funds instead of pricey 401(k) mutual funds. Lower fees means thousands of dollars a year staying in your account and growing for you.\n\nJust as money grows with compounding, so does the impact of fees. If you invested $100,000 one time and left it for 20 years at a market return, you should expect a balance of just over $400,000 at the end of that period.\n\nPay a 2% fee and your end balance would be a little more than $275,000 instead. Which figure would you rather see on your retirement statement, $400,000 or $275,000?\n\nSo where did the rest of your money go? To the 401(k) administrators and the fund managers, that\u2019s where.\n\nUnsurprisingly, most 401(k) plans make it incredibly hard to estimate their \u201call in\u201d costs. There are fees from the plan itself, fees for mutual funds inside the plan, then more fees nested inside those funds.\n\nRead: It\u2019s going to be easier to make early 401(k) withdrawals, but should you do it?\n\nA secure retirement\n\nIf you have access to a 401(k), that\u2019s great. You get automated saving and investing, a great tax break now, and, in most companies, free matching funds from your employer. As long as you work there and get the matching money, go ahead and take advantage of these benefits.\n\nYet Americans now have $8.8 trillion stashed in IRAs, roughly a third of all retirement assets. An astounding 84% of new IRAs were opened with money rolled over from workplace plans. The reason is lower costs.\n\nIf your company is small or even medium-size, chances are you pay too much for your retirement plan. A self-directed IRA could help you secure tens of thousands of dollars more for retirement.\n\nOn your last day of work at your soon-to-be old job, march straight to human resources and ask for IRA rollover instructions in writing.
