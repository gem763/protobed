Earlier this year, four Frenchmen were sentenced to death in Iraq in a judicial process heavily criticised at the time.\n\nSome foreign governments have revoked citizenship to prevent a return - for example in the case of Shamima Begum, from the UK, who is being held in a camp in Syria.\n\nFar larger numbers of foreigners who joined IS are likely to have made their own way home before the fall of the group this year.\n\nReturning European nationals Voluntary and state-facilited returns\n\nKing's College's International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation estimates the numbers globally to be between 7,712 and 8,202.\n\nThis includes both voluntary returns as well as government-facilitated repatriations, although it adds the latter are likely to be minimal.\n\nJoanna Cook and Gina Vale, co-authors of the study, told BBC News: \"Many governments appear more willing to facilitate the return of minors, particularly vulnerable ones like orphans, than the return of adult detainees.\"\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "The US wants European countries to take back detained nationals who joined IS - has anyone done so?", "authors": ["Reality Check Team", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ACC2/production/_109162244_is_blindfolds.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
