It\u2019ll be an unspeakable, unusable part of this political drama.\u201d\n\nCheck out the clip above.", "description": "The MSNBC host fears the term will soon become meaningless.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9c4aab200000d0024f33b4.png?cache=yu1zrmzhyi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
