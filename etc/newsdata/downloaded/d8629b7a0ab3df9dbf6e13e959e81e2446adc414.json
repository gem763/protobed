He does this occasionally, releasing big manifestos about where he stands, to portray himself as a responsible thinker about society at large. He\u2019s written big manifestos about building global community (sure) and deciding to encrypt everything (self-serving), but this was the first time he decided to speak his thoughts rather than write them. Delivered yesterday afternoon at Georgetown\u2019s Gaston Hall, the speech concerned voice and free expression and had a very, dare I say, presidential air.\n\nWhich is to say: The speech was embarrassing. It was convoluted, nonsensical, a greatest-hits album of the ideological inconsistencies that Facebook relies upon whenever Zuckerberg needs to defend his predatory business model as some type of global charity. It was Zuckerberg arguing with straw men and bogeymen.\n\nAlmost immediately, Zuckerberg revealed himself to be \u2014 and I am trying to say this with as little malice as possible \u2014 completely full of shit. \u201cWhen I was in college, our country had just gone to war in Iraq. The mood on campus was disbelief. It felt like we were acting without hearing a lot of important perspectives,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently. Those early years shaped my belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time.\u201d\n\nThis is a truly wild retcon. The origin story of Facebook at this point was well-known, but given how much Zuckerberg wants to not talk about that, it\u2019s worth restating. Facebook started as FaceMash, a web app that allowed Harvard students to choose which of two other students they thought was more attractive. Early on, as he built out Facebook\u2019s social network, Zuckerberg referred to people trusting him with their data as \u201cdumb fucks.\u201d These are well-established facts, and these early transgressions would not be worth repeating endlessly if Zuckerberg were willing to own up to them. Instead he continues to retrofit new company stances onto its founding myth.\n\nIt\u2019s this inability to cop to even the simplest things that permeates everything that Zuckerberg does. A company constantly worried about \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior\u201d from Russian trolls might want to look inward at some of the inauthentic behavior in its C-suite. As the Washington Post\u2019s Nitasha Tiku pointed out yesterday, \u201cfree speech\u201d is not mentioned a single time in Zuckerberg\u2019s 2012 pre-IPO letter to investors, yet apparently it\u2019s been a core value from the beginning.\n\nVarious portions of Zuckerberg\u2019s speech read like he Googled \u201cfree speech controversies\u201d and paraphrased the Wikipedia entries he found. \u201cThe first Supreme Court case to seriously consider free speech and the First Amendment was in 1919,\u201d and so on. He raised the specter of Chinese censorship, citing the fact that the current Hong Kong protests were being kept off TikTok at the behest of the Chinese government.\n\nZuckerberg tied his mission of free speech to the efforts of Martin Luther King Jr. This immediately backfired when King\u2019s daughter tweeted that Facebook failed to understand \u201cthe challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians. These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d\n\nI heard #MarkZuckerberg's \u2018free expression\u2019 speech, in which he referenced my father. I'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians. These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination. pic.twitter.com/h97gvVmtSZ \u2014 Be A King (@BerniceKing) October 17, 2019\n\nPerhaps the wildest part of Zuckerberg\u2019s speech was when he defended the rights of \u2026 politicians? Facebook has come under fire recently, and rightfully so, for a platform policy that allows politicians to lie in their campaign ads. \u201cIn general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\u201d he said, defending their right to lie. The power dynamics here are all wrong. Incumbent politicians are the ones in power, who already have easy access to traditional outlets and substantial advertising budgets. They are not an oppressed class who deserve permission to lie to their constituents. Challengers, similarly, should not be able to gain political power by lying. This feels very basic to me.\n\nMaybe Facebook should ban political ads entirely, he pondered, before rejecting the notion. \u201cBanning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers,\u201d he asserted. Donald Trump, the current president of the United States, has spent far more on Facebook ads this year than any Democratic challenger.\n\nAgain, most civic-minded Americans would find Zuckerberg\u2019s general stance agreeable: Free speech is good. But the content of speech is only one half of the criticism Facebook faces. There is a difference, as many have pointed out, between speech and reach. The First Amendment (which Facebook is not beholden to) protects the right to say disagreeable and untrue things. It does not say that person has a right to have those statements disseminated widely. For all of the time Zuckerberg spent defending free-speech principles, he spent no time defending the algorithmic weighting that decides what Facebook users see when they scroll through their News Feed.\n\nFor a long time, Facebook\u2019s software preferred polarizing content that guided people to emotional extremes, increasing site engagement. And yet Zuckerberg claimed yesterday that he wants to reduce polarization. \u201cMuch of the research I\u2019ve seen is mixed and suggests the internet could actually decrease aspects of polarization,\u201d he said. This is great stuff. The research is inconclusive, and yet it somehow also supports Facebook\u2019s interests.\n\nThere was one intriguing part of the speech, tucked in the middle. A tacit acknowledgment that Facebook poses a liability to modern society not just because of its political stances or platform policies, but because of its scale. \u201cInevitably some people will use their voice to organize violence, undermine elections or hurt others, and we have a responsibility to address these risks,\u201d Zuckerberg acknowledged. \u201cWhen you\u2019re serving billions of people, even if a very small percent cause harm, that can still be a lot of harm.\u201d\n\nAs someone who has listened to a lot of empty Zuckerberg statements over the years, I cannot recall him acknowledging this fact before. Facebook often signals good news in concrete numbers (\u201cmillions of users shared the inspiring dog video\u201d) and bad news in percentages (\u201cless than one percent of users were affected by the data breach\u201d). What I cannot recall Facebook acknowledging prior to this is that a tiny percentage of users is still millions of people. When Facebook screws up, even on a proportionally small scale, it warps and endangers millions of people. (In contrast, consider that just a handful of injuries or deaths need to occur for a product recall in the U.S.) The scale of Facebook \u2014 billions of people on an improperly maintained, centralized platform \u2014 is the problem. I don\u2019t anticipate Zuckerberg giving a speech on that topic anytime soon.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
