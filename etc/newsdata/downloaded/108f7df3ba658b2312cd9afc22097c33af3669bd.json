They respect my view, and they support me all the way,\u201d said Lam, dressed in a cream suit and looking less tense than a televised appearance the day before.\n\nShe withdrew the bill, which has plunged the Chinese territory into its worst political crisis in decades, on Wednesday. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index surged more than 4% to a one-month high ahead of the announcement. On Thursday, the market was up 0.4% by midday.\n\nLam also announced other measures including opening a platform for dialogue with society to try to address other deep-rooted economic, social and political problems, including housing and mobility for young people, that she said were contributing to the current impasse.\n\n\u201cWe must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions,\u201d she said.\n\nThe withdrawal of the bill was one of the pro-democracy protesters\u2019 five demands, although many demonstrators and lawmakers said the move was too little, too late.\n\nThe four other demands are: retraction of the word \u201criot\u201d to describe rallies, release of all demonstrators, an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.\n\nDemonstrators were still calling for all demands to be met, with many placing emphasis on the independent inquiry. Lam said on Thursday that the independent police complaints council was credible enough to address the probe.\n\n\u201cWe have all suffered from a humanitarian disaster caused by the government and police force,\u201d said Wong, one of around 100 medical students protesting at Hong Kong University. Clad in gas masks, they formed a human chain shouting \u201cFive demands, indispensable.\u201d \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time.\u201d\n\nTEST AHEAD\n\nFurther protests are planned including on Saturday another \u201cstress test\u201d at the airport, which was targeted by protesters on Sunday leading to clashes with police on approach roads and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.\n\nThe official China Daily said the withdrawal of the bill was an olive branch that leaves demonstrators with no excuse to continue the violence.\n\nThe announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealed that Beijing had thwarted Lam\u2019s earlier proposals to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.\n\nHong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam reacts at the end of a news conference in Hong Kong, China September 5, 2019.

Local newspaper Apple Daily said the house belonged to Jimmy Lai, the newspaper\u2019s owner, who was in the property at the time. Pro-democracy publishing tycoon Lai is an outspoken critic of Beijing.\n\nThe bill was seen as the latest example of what many residents see as ever-tighter control by Beijing, despite the promise of autonomy.\n\nThe former British colony was handed back to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d administration which gave the city of more than 7 million people more freedoms than mainland cities, such as an independent judiciary - prompting the anger over the extradition bill.\n\nThe protests are the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s rule since he took power in 2012. China denies meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs and accuses Western countries of fuelling the unrest.\n\nImages of some of the fiercest clashes have been beamed live on television screens across the world, sending jitters across the international business community and leading to a large drop in tourism.\n\nThe Hong Kong government took out a full-page advert in the Australian Financial Review on Thursday saying it is \u201cdetermined to achieve a peaceful, rational and reasonable resolution\u201d and is resolutely committed to \u201cone country, two systems\u201d.\n\nIt ends the advert by saying: \u201cWe will no doubt bounce back. We always do.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nMore than 1,100 people have been arrested since the violence escalated in June and Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade.\n\nChina has strongly denounced the violence and warned it could use force to restore order.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Thursday that China \"understands, respects and supports\" her government's move to formally withdraw an extradition bill, part of measures she hoped would help the city \"move forward\" from months of unrest.", "authors": ["Farah Master", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426403859&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8409F", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
