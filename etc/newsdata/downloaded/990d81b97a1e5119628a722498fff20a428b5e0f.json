Isra\u00ebl said that while it currently in Arianespace\u2019s planning scope to transport crew aboard their spacecraft, they could delivery landers and orbiters aboard the Ariane 6, which would set the stage for crew missions to follow \u2013 including potentially NASA\u2019s Artemis program.\n\nAriane 6 is a two-stage medium-heavy lift launch system currently in development by Arianespace, under the direction of the European Space Agency. It\u2019s aiming to have its first test flights next year, which makes the 2023 target for its first lunar orbit mission with paying customer cargo on board ambitious.\n\nIf Ariane 6 can make that target, however, it could become a crucial transport mechanism for any long-term attempts to not only ensure we can get crew to the Moon, but establish a working infrastructure and stay there, with humans spending long spans of time there living, working and researching.", "description": "European launch provider Arianespace announced some exciting news regarding its ambitions for the Moon at the International Astronautical Congress today.
