The tailback tied a franchise record with four rushing touchdowns during Sunday\u2019s 34-24 victory over the Cowboys.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say it was worth it, but the picture is a dope picture,\u201d Jones said Friday. \u201cI can\u2019t argue with that. I\u2019m going to have that blown up one day in my house. I definitely got a nice picture out of it, but it hurts my pocket a little bit. I want that money.\u201d\n\nJones said he plans to appeal the fine, hoping it could be reduced since he is a first-time offender. After the win, he said he didn\u2019t even realize that he waved at Jones.\n\n\u201cThroughout the game it gets chippy, and I\u2019m not a guy who starts talking trash,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut once you start talking trash to me, I usually don\u2019t stop. I\u2019m going to let you know when I make a play.\u201d\n\nThrough five games this season, Jones has 78 carries for 302 yards and eight touchdowns. He has also recorded 19 receptions for 150 yards.\n\nThe Packers (4-1) will play the Detroit Lions (2-1-1) on Monday night.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 Green Bay Packers running back Aaron Jones was fined by the NFL for taunting Dallas Cowboys cornerback Byron Jones.
