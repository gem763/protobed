REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday signaled reluctance to overturn appointments to Puerto Rico\u2019s federally created financial oversight board in a dispute that could disrupt the panel\u2019s restructuring of about $120 billion of the bankrupt U.S. territory\u2019s debt.\n\nThe justices are considering an appeal by the board after a lower court ruled that the 2016 appointments of its seven members violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s so-called appointments clause because they were not confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe legal challenge to the board\u2019s composition was brought in 2017 by Puerto Rico creditors including Aurelius Investment, LLC, a hedge fund that holds Puerto Rico bonds, and Uni\u00f3n de Trabajadores de la Industria El\u00e9ctrica y Riego, Inc, a labor group that represents workers at Puerto Rico\u2019s government-owned electricity utility.\n\nBondholders face losses as a result of debt restructuring while the labor group has said the board\u2019s proposed restructuring of the utility\u2019s debt would lead to its members having worse working conditions.\n\nSeveral of the nine justices appeared concerned about the potential broad ramifications of a victory for the challengers in part because of the effect it could have on other appointees in U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. Justice Brett Kavanaugh described it as a \u201cserious concern.\u201d\n\nThe ruling ultimately is likely to hinge on whether the justices think that the board primarily has control over local issues or is exercising federal control. Several seemed to indicate that they saw the board as being more an instrument of the territorial government, which would favor those defending the current appointments.\n\n\u201cIts focus is on Puerto Rico,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said of the board.\n\nA ruling is due by the end of June.", "description": "U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday signaled reluctance to overturn appointments to Puerto Rico's federally created financial oversight board in a dispute that could disrupt the panel's restructuring of about $120 billion of the bankrupt U.S. territory's debt.", "authors": ["Lawrence Hurley", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441159791&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1EU", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
