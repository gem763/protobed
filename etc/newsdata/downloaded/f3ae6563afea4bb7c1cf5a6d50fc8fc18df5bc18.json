However, it was unlikely that the EU's 27 remaining member states would refuse Britain's delay request.\n\nGove said government would now step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, including triggering its \"Operation Yellowhammer\" contingency plans.\n\n\"The risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension, that is why I will later today be chairing a Cabinet committee meeting (...) in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations, our preparedness for a no-deal, is accelerated,\" he said.
