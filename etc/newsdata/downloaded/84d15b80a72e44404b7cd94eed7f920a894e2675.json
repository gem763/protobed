Emperor tamarins are known for their long white mustaches, experts said.\n\nFleck is known for having a slightly bushier mustache than Poe, according to the zoo. Poe\u2019s mustache is smaller and pointier. The brothers weigh about 1 pound each. They spend most of their time in trees, looking for food.\n\nAD\n\nThe brothers made their public debut at the zoo Oct. 23. They\u2019re part of the zoo\u2019s Amazonia forest exhibit, which includes 14 other animals, including two titi monkeys, one two-toed sloth and 11 birds.\n\nAD\n\nEmperor tamarins live in social groups in the wild, and the two brothers are never far from each other, zoo officials said. They\u2019re also known to vocalize to each other. In the wild, experts said, the monkeys help care for younger siblings until it\u2019s time for them to leave the group and establish their own families.\n\nOfficials said that in the wild, emperor tamarins are found in the Amazon rainforests of Bolivia, Peru and Brazil. Experts said their populations in the wild are stable, and they\u2019re classified as a species of \u201cleast concern\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But they\u2019re \u201cvulnerable to habitat loss from development and agriculture,\u201d according to a statement from the zoo.\n\nAD\n\nThe monkeys aren\u2019t the only new animals at the zoo.\n\nOfficials said they also welcomed a lesser kudu calf Oct. 14.\n\nZoo officials said the new kudu (say that five times fast!) weighs about 19 pounds and is \u201cnursing, moving well, exploring and bonding behind-the-scenes\u201d with his mom, 5-year-old Rogue, and 10-month-old brother Kushukuru. His father is 9-year-old Garrett.\n\nAD\n\nOfficials said they have not set a date for the new kudu\u2019s debut at the Cheetah Conservation exhibit but that it would probably be later this fall, depending on the weather.\n\nZookeepers said the new lesser kudu is \u201cbold and alert.\u201d The two young kudus chase and \u201cspar with each other and their father,\u201d officials said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nLesser kudus are a species of antelope but are known for being more distinct, with white stripes that run down their flanks. They also have markings on their face that often include black stripes from their eyes toward their nose, and white stripes across the center of their face. The males have a grayish-brown-colored coat and spiral horns that can grow up to 3\u00bd feet long. Female lesser kudus have a reddish-brown coat. Their unique coloring helps them hide in nature.\n\nAD\n\nLesser kudus are sexually mature between 15 and 18 months. But male lesser kudus don\u2019t have the \u201csocial status\u201d to mate until they are usually 4 or 5. Lesser kudus are known to have \u201cshoving matches\u201d between males and females where their heads and horns are pressed together as they try to \u201cforce horns upon the opponent\u2019s nape,\u201d according to the zoo\u2019s website.\n\nThe contests also involve the male and female lesser kudus standing on their hind legs as they try to push each other over, zoo officials said. Typically, the male wins, but he does not \u201cshow aggression toward the female during the process,\u201d the zoo\u2019s website stated.\n\nAD\n\nGestation for lesser kudus lasts six to eight months. The doe, zoo experts said, gives birth to a calf after she separates herself from the group. The calf usually is \u201cconcealed by surrounding brush while its mother forages for food,\u201d the zoo\u2019s website said.\n\nAD\n\nIn the wild, lesser kudus are found in parts of Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia. There are about 100,000 lesser kudus in the wild, according to the zoo, and they\u2019re considered to be \u201cnear threatened\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Their population in the wild is decreasing, in part, because of hunting and disease, experts said. In the wild, lesser kudus typically live up to 15 years, and in captivity they can live up to 20 years, experts said.\n\nAD", "description": "They're no pandas, but a lesser kudu and two mustachioed monkeys are the National Zoo's newest arrivals.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KOqb0GZO7CuM7Hr5B27WhCCync0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZCSXCVTYOBGDHCRKNWBRF3TIW4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
