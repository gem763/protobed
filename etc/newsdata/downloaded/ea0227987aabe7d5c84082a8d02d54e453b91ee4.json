Photo: Fox News/YouTube\n\nLast night, President Trump gave an interview to Fox News personality Sean Hannity. Or did Hannity give the interview to Fox News personality Donald Trump? Take the quiz to guess which of the following was a Hannity \u201cquestion\u201d and which was a Trump \u201canswer.\u201d\n\n1. \u201cWe spent two and a half years hearing about Trump-Russia collusion. They ignore the dossier, and Ukraine admitting that they helped Hillary.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cLook at the double standard, though. You\u2019ve got Hillary and the dossier. You\u2019ve got Ukraine interfering on her behalf. Then you\u2019ve got Schiff, who\u2019s been telling us for three years. Then he\u2019s connected to the whistle-blower, so he can\u2019t bring the whistle-blower in.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cThe dossier was totally fake, and now it\u2019s been proven to be fake. People know how that was done. I mean, you have track record \u2014 now you know as well as \u2014 everybody knows. I guess they\u2019re doing an investigation.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cDrudge says Elizabeth Warren, it\u2019s hers to lose, you have Bernie, Mayor Pete, Kamala Harris, whatever. Then you look at their positions. Top marginal tax rate 70 percent. Ninety percent corporate-tax rate. The New Green Deal, $96 trillion in ten years, Medicare for All, no private option. You come to a running against one of those, who do you think it is?\u201d\n\n5. \u201cBased on a very minor conversation with the president of a country who just got elected \u2014 nice guy, it was really a congratulatory conversation \u2014 the first page is, you know, congratulations on your win, et cetera, et cetera. Couldn\u2019t have been nicer. I tell you, Lindsay Graham said \u2014 when he read it, he said, \u2018I never knew that Trump was that nice a person.\u2019\u201d\n\n6. \u201cYes. They see what\u2019s going on. They see the level of popularity when they look at Minnesota. Minneapolis was incredible. When they look at Dallas. When they look at Louisiana. When they look at North Carolina, the two seats we just picked up. They see what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. Congressman Al Green, a Democrat, said we have to impeach him because he\u2019s going to win.\u201d\n\n7. \u201cWell, obviously, you know, you talk about it hurting the country. He said, we better impeach him, because he\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re not going to be able to beat him. That was the phrase.\u201d\n\n8. Yes \u2014 it was parody. So this is a corrupt politician. He should be impeached. And Nancy Pelosi should be impeached. They should not allow this, with that it\u2019s possibly going to help, you know, from the standpoint of winning the election. I don\u2019t know. They say it\u2019s going to help a lot with respect to winning the House back, but it\u2019s not the right thing.\u201d\n\n9. \u201cI want to go to the double standard again; whether it\u2019s the dossier, whether it\u2019s Ukraine helping and interfering on our elections, whether \u2014 there is no quid pro quo. Then you can add Hunter Biden and Joe Biden on tape bragging about using taxpayer dollars to demand the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor. Hunter Biden admits no experience Ukraine, China. No experience in oil, gas, energy, or private equity. Millions of dollars \u2026 Why was he given that money? Would anyone else get that money?\u201d\n\nAnswers below the video of the full interview:\n\n[1. Hannity. 2. Hannity. 3. Trump. 4. Hannity. 5. Trump. 6. Trump. 7. Hannity. 8. Trump. 9.
