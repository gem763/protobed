It hit its weakest level in more than a month this week.\n\nThe lira has been pulled in both directions this week by comments from U.S. President Donald Trump. A day after warning he could \"obliterate\" Turkey's economy if it went too far in its Syria operation, Trump tweeted on Tuesday that Ankara was a \"big trading partner\" of the United States and had been \"good to deal with\".\n\nThe extensive area of Ankara's planned incursion into Syria could lead to months of military activity that raises concern in the markets, dealers say.\n\nTensions between the United States and Turkey have been simmering in recent months over issues including Ankara's purchase of Russian missile defence systems and disagreements over policy in Syria.
