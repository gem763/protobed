He likely saw Abraham Lincoln\u2019s top hat, memorabilia from Barack Obama\u2019s election campaign and reminders of other leaders who, whatever their flaws, strove for a more perfect union.\n\nThen he ran into Donald Trump.\n\nNot once, but twice, Niinist\u00f6 had to wear a so-this-is-perfectly-normal expression in public as the US president ranted and raved during two question and answer sessions with reporters, playing an even more extreme version of himself (not that the original was middle of the road).\n\nImpeachment, it seems, has got under Trump\u2019s skin like nothing else. Over the past week his tone has become more frantic, frenzied and apocalyptic. On Wednesday, the world saw his id run riot. #TrumpMeltdown trended on Twitter.\n\n'We're not fooling around': Pelosi and Schiff stand firm as Trump fumes Read more\n\n\u201cSo *NOW* can we *FINALLY* have a serious national conversation about the psychological condition of the President of the United States?\u201d asked George Conway, a lawyer married to the White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway.\n\nYes, it was dark and scary for anyone worried about the life signs of the 243-year-old republic. But it was also just downright strange, even avant-garde. It was Samuel Beckett. It was Marcel Duchamp. It was John Lennon and Yoko Ono\u2019s bed-in. Trump invited Niinist\u00f6 to take a front row seat in his theatre of the absurd.\n\nFirst, the pair spoke to reporters in the Oval Office, against all the usual trappings of fireplace, flags and exquisitely upholstered chairs. Trump was naturally asked about the impeachment inquiry that followed the July phone conversation in which he pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate a political rival.\n\nThe president has been trying to paint Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, as the most zealous witch hunter. \u201cThey should look at him for treason because he is making up the words of the president of the United States,\u201d Trump said, hammering away at his theme that Schiff misquoted him at a congressional hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t call him \u2018Shifty Schiff\u2019 for nothing. He\u2019s a shifty, dishonest guy.\u201d\n\nThen, an unexpected turn. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s an expression: he couldn\u2019t carry his \u2018blank\u2019 strap. I won\u2019t say it because they\u2019ll say it was so terrible to say. But that guy couldn\u2019t carry his \u2018blank\u2019 strap. You understand that.\u201d\n\nNo, not really.\n\nWith jazz hands and other random gestures, Trump rambled on a bit and mysteriously changed the nickname of his nemesis to \u201cShifty Shifft\u201d.\n\nThen a reporter got his turn. \u201cFinnish media here. Finland is the happiest country in the world.\u201d\n\nTrump agreed, \u201cFinland is a happy country,\u201d and playfully slapped Niinist\u00f6 on his left knee. Niinist\u00f6 looked uncomfortable but said, \u201cYeah, for sure.\u201d\n\nThe reporter continued: \u201cWhat can you learn? What can you learn from Finland, which has a social democratic\u2026\u201d Inexplicably, Trump replied: \u201cWell, you got rid of Pelosi and you got rid of Shifty Schiff. Finland is a happy country. He\u2019s a happy leader, too.\u201d\n\nBoth leaders chuckled.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sauli Niinist\u00f6 wore a so-this-is-perfectly-normal expression in public as the US president ranted and raved.

But another journalist had a question about a New York Times report that the president had suggested protecting his border wall with electrification, spikes and a moat containing snakes or alligators.\n\nFirst, Trump got his newspapers crossed. \u201cIt\u2019s written by Washington Post people, so you know it\u2019s inaccurate. You know it\u2019s probably a fraud.\u201d\n\nThen he admitted the limits of his vocabulary. \u201cOK, ready? That I wanted a wall, but I wanted a moat. A moat \u2013 whatever that is. It\u2019s not a word I used, but they used it. A moat.\u201d\n\nA couple of hours later, there was round two, a joint press conference with Niinist\u00f6 under the cornices and crystal chandeliers of the east room. Anyone hoping that sanity would prevail was in for a disappointment.\n\nMore in sorrow than in anger, Trump put his persecution complex on full display and sought to tug at the heart strings. \u201cWe had the Mueller collusion delusion, OK? That went on for years. And that\u2019s finally done. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. It was a joke, and everyone knows it. And it was from the day one.\n\nThe Mueller report did in fact find 10 instances of Trump attempting to obstruct justice. He went on: \u201cNow I get three days of peace, and I\u2019m walking into the United Nations, going to meet with the biggest leaders in the world, and I hear about the word \u2018impeachment\u2019. I said, \u2018What did I do now?\u2019 And it was about a beautiful conversation that I had.\u201d\n\nTrump clutched a printout of a New York Times article that said Schiff learned about the outlines of the whistleblower\u2019s concerns days before the complaint was filed. But the president\u2019s doesn\u2019t do nuance. \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s a scandal that he knew before,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d go a step further: I think he\u2019s probably helped write it. OK? That\u2019s what the word is.\u201d\n\nWhose word? There is zero evidence that Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint.\n\nAnother question came from the Reuters journalist Jeff Mason, regarding Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201ctreason\u201d. The president gave another meandering answer about \u201cShifty\u201d Schiff and claimed: \u201cBelieve it or not, I watch my words very carefully. There are those that think I\u2019m a very stable genius.\u201d\n\nMason followed up, asking what Trump wanted Zelenskiy to do in relation to Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president unleashed a tirade about corruption and his misgivings over giving US money. \u201cI don\u2019t like being the sucker country.\u201d\n\nMason persisted with his original question. \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d Trump demanded. Then he angrily told Mason to ask Niinist\u00f6 a question instead. \u201cI\u2019ve given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question. Don\u2019t be rude!\u201d\n\nMason coolly explained: \u201cNo, sir. I don\u2019t want to be rude. I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that I asked you.\u201d\n\nTrump retorted: \u201cI\u2019ve answered everything. It\u2019s a whole hoax. And you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you,\u201d he pointed at Mason, \u201cand the fake news media that we have in this country. And I say, in many cases, the \u2018corrupt media\u2019 \u2013 because you\u2019re corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it\u2019s corrupt.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters reporter did put a question to the Finnish president about the World Trade Organisation and illegal tariffs. Trump brusquely interrupted: \u201cThat was a big win for the United States, right? You never had wins with other presidents, did you?\u201d\n\nThe long suffering, eternally patient Niinist\u00f6 tried to get a word in edgeways, and finally did: \u201cBut I think the question is for me. First of all, when I referred to your democracy, I just wanted to tell that I\u2019m impressed what American people have gained during these decades \u2013 a hundred-so years \u2013 building up very impressive democracy.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he added, \u201ckeep it going on.\u201d", "description": "A joint conference with the Finnish president descended into theatrics as reporters pressed for answers on the unfolding scandal", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40632db7faa7a24a755bbf02e79454445a8b69ce/0_345_5179_3108/master/5179.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8dd7b042feaade75247f32c482773c8b"}
