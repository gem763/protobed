It's Sharon,' an aide told The Sun this week.\n\nThe Queen's unusual code name has been revealed, according to a royal source who claims that when the royal is working (pictured visiting Cambridge in July this year) she is given the alternative moniker 'Sharon', or often called just 'S' by aides and security\n\nWhen asked whether this was likely, royal historian Hugo Vickers told the publication: 'It is highly likely. The purpose of any sobriquet is that it should be anonymous and memorable.\n\n'If it can also be a bit mischievous and therefore all the more memorable, then that makes sense. Although S might simply stand for Sovereign of course.'\n\nAnd while the Queen may be known by a secret code names to bodyguards, when in private, her loved ones refer to her by their own nicknames.\n\nPrince Philip refers to his wife as 'Lilibet', playing on her name Elizabeth, and is also believed to call her 'sausage' when they are alone.\n\nMeanwhile the Queen is known as \u2018Gary\u2019 courtesy of Prince William who, as a youngster, struggled to pronounce \u2018granny\u2019 and would call her the name instead.\n\nThe Queen pictured leaving Crathie Kirk after attending a Sunday church service near Balmoral, this weekend. An expert said it was likely that the monarch goes by a code name\n\nElsewhere, her great grandchildren Prince George and Princess Charlotte refer to Her Majesty as 'Gan-Gan'.\n\nThe latest claims follow reports that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were called \u2018David Stevens\u2019 and \u2018Davina Scott\u2019 by their protection officers.\n\nThe secret code names were said to use the initials \u2018DS\u2019 from their official title, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, to prevent their contact details from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nMeanwhile Prince William and Kate Middleton are reportedly called \u2018Danny Collins\u2019 and \u2018Daphne Clark\u2019 in their aides\u2019 contact lists.\n\nIt was previously claimed that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle (pictured during their tour of Africa) were called \u2018David Stevens\u2019 and \u2018Davina Scott\u2019 by their protection officers\n\nFor Prince William and Kate Middleton, the couple are reportedly labelled \u2018Danny Collins\u2019 and \u2018Daphne Clark\u2019 in their aides\u2019 contact lists\n\nThe initials \u2018DC\u2019 in the secret code names allude, of course, to the royal couple\u2019s title \u2013 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reports the Daily Star.\n\n\u2018If anyone got hold of a phone belonging to a royal aide or security team member, they won\u2019t find Harry Windsor and Meghan\u2019s names in it,\u2019 said a royal source, adding, \u2018it is far too risky in the wrong hands. They get given code names but they are changed regularly for obvious reasons.\u2019\n\nThe publication reported how an insider told them that a worker at a royal event was handed a phone with a 'random name' on the screen by one of Harry's aides.\n\nFailing to recognise the name on the assistant\u2019s mobile, the confused worker asked why the person on the line wanted to speak with him.\n\nThe source added: \u2018Imagine the surprise he got when he heard Harry\u2019s voice on the other end of the line.\u2019", "description": "The Queen's unusual code name has been revealed, according to a royal source who claims that when the royal is working she is given the alternative moniker 'Sharon', or often called just 'S' by aides.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/11/19438596-0-image-a-14_1570532007923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
