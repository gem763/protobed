ETH price even traded above the $180 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. However, the bulls failed to push the price further higher and it remained well below the $185 resistance. A swing high was formed near the $182 level and the price recently declined below $180 and $178.\n\nMoreover, there was a break below the $175 support area and the 100 hourly SMA. The decline was such that the price even broke the $172 support. Finally, it tested the $170 support area. The bears made two attempts to push the price below the $170 support, but they failed to gain strength. As a result, there was an upside correction above the $172 level.\n\nThe price broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $182 high to $170 low. However, the previous support near the $175 level and the 100 hourly SMA is currently acting as a resistance. Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $182 high to $170 low is also acting as a solid resistance. More importantly, there is a major contracting triangle forming with support near $170 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nIf there is a downside break below the $170 support, the price could continue to decline. The next key support is near $165, below which the price is likely to test $160. Conversely, an upside break above $182 and $185 is needed for bullish acceleration.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly preparing for the next move either above $185 or below $170. As long as the price is below the $175 pivot level and the 100 hourly SMA, there is a risk of a downside break.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is slowly moving into the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is currently just above the 40 level, with a positive angle.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $170\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $182", "description": "Ethereum price is preparing for the next move versus the US Dollar, while consolidating vs bitcoin.
