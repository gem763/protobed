He immediately increased the prize money to a total of $US1 million, with $US100,000 for each regional winner and $US30,000 for each finalist. The result: the number of applicants grew right away and, Vigneron says, the quality increased. This year there were 2900 entrants.\n\nMany luxury brands invest in philanthropy, but often it\u2019s done with a sense of lustre that matches the brand itself.\n\nMany luxury brands invest in philanthropy, but often it\u2019s done with a sense of lustre that matches the brand itself. This is not the case at Cartier, where finalists are awarded for their decidedly unglamorous ventures. Take Emily Levy, co-founder and CEO of Mighty Well. Levy suffers from Lyme disease and permanently wears a cannula in her arm to deliver antibiotics. Her doctor told her to protect the cannula with an old sock; Levy had a better idea, so she created a business that manufactures stylish, functional apparel for medical devices.\n\nRan Ma, who won the North American division this year, has a similar story: her company, Siren, produces smart socks that can detect wounds in diabetics, who often experience loss of feeling in their extremities. Fariel Salahuddin, from Pakistan, is the founder and CEO of UpTrade, which allows off-grid rural communities in her country to exchange livestock for solar-powered water pumps and electricity.\n\nRan Ma of San Francisco, winner of the North American regional prize, is the founder of Siren, which manufactures socks for diabetes patients. Supplied\n\nIt\u2019s about as far from Elizabeth Taylor draping herself on Richard Burton as you can get, but for Vigneron, the two are equally as valuable to Cartier. \u201cReally, the best thing you can do in business is empower women,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt changes everything.\u201d\n\nThe awards have become a true start-up accelerator. YiDing Yu, a 2018 winner, is the founder of Twiage, a medical app that uses Twitter-like technology to connect ambulance services and hospital emergency rooms in real time. It was credited with preventing measles outbreaks in Boston and New York earlier this year.\n\nThere's also Brazilian Isabel Pesce Matteos, who won in 2014 for her education company FazINOVA aimed at entrepreneurs. Since winning, she has extended the company with a publishing arm and a social media app to connect the 30 million founders accessing her education programs.\n\nFor six months before the awards week, finalists are matched with mentors to help them craft business plans and articulate their goals.\n\nIn 2019, Vigneron added a seventh region \u2013 South-East Asia and Oceania \u2013 and enlisted TED to help the finalists hone their communication skills. \u201cOne of the difficulties women [founders] face is credibility,\u201d he says, speaking purposefully in his perfect, accented English. \u201cPartnering with TED helps them tell their personal story in a very impactful way. That helps when you\u2019re in front of an audience, in front of an investor, giving your elevator pitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor six months before the awards week, finalists are matched with mentors in their field to help them craft business plans and articulate their goals. Each mentor is chosen with care: Levy\u2019s mentor, for instance, was a former vice-president at Nike \u2013 the perfect person to help her navigate the world of performance wear.\n\nClaire Yan was a 2019 finalist for the Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Award for East Asia. Her business \u2013 Cobbler\u2019s Suggest \u2013 connects China\u2019s ageing population of cobblers and craftsmen with a new generation of luxury shoppers, fixing damaged shoes (and now, handbags), keeping them out of landfill and in wardrobes\n\n\u201cShoes are very personal,\u201d says Yan. \u201cIf you like them, you keep them as long as you can.\u201d\n\nCobblers Suggest founder Claire Yan was a finalist for the 2019 Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Award for East Asia. Supplied\n\nThe idea for her business begins with a familiar tale. \u201cOne day I walked out with heels on, and almost right away, I damaged the heel,\" she says. \"I ended up with a wardrobe full of almost new high heels that I couldn\u2019t wear because they were damaged and I couldn\u2019t find anywhere to get them fixed.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s growing wealth, she says, has led to a surplus of luxury goods and a scarcity of traditional repair services. It\u2019s the stuff of environmental nightmares, with an estimated 26 million tonnes of clothing going into landfill annually.\n\nThe business operates mainly on WeChat, the hugely popular Chinese social media platform, though it recently launched on Chinese online retail site TMall. Customers choose the service they like and either drop off their goods or have them picked up, to be repaired by an expert team of craftsmen. Just three years after it was founded, Cobbler\u2019s Suggest employs 23 cobblers with an average experience of 20 years, using their otherwise forgotten skills.\n\nWIA winners, from left Yeon Jeong Cho, Carmina Bayombong, Liza Velarde, Hibah Shata, Zineb Agoumi, Manka Angwafo and Ran Ma. Supplied\n\nAt Cobbler\u2019s Suggest, says Yan, there is a sense of validation in the cobblers\u2019 skills. \u201cFixing things is actually much more difficult than making something new,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to make the shoes as close as possible to a new pair, and that is hard.\u201d So far, the company has saved 20,000 pairs of shoes from landfill. Yan will invest her $US30,000 prize money in the company\u2019s research centre, which explores new ways to repair tricky materials such as suede and silk.\n\nThe day after the awards, all 21 finalists presented to venture capital firms across San Francisco. Which is all to say: none of this is lip service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this suggestion, Vigneron nods. \u201cWe give back to the community, yes. But it is not just about that. We want to scale that support.\u201d Funding is one piece of the puzzle, investing in training is another. And simply getting the participants in the same room has its own power, he says. \u201cYou know, to be an entrepreneur you need to be bold and pursue ideas others may find mad. So meeting other people on that journey is very helpful.\u201d\n\nVigneron, like the company he heads, is a natural storyteller. He knows jewellery serves no real purpose, which of course is the whole point of it. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes jewellery so very special,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no function except to look good, or maybe to convey power, like a crown or tiara. But mostly it has no real use. And I actually love that about jewellery.\u201d\n\nWhen you ask someone, \u2018do you love me?\u2019, you expect \u2018yes\u2019, of course. And then you think, \u2018OK \u2013 but how many carats?' \u2014 Vigneron on jewellery\n\nHe loves that it\u2019s an expression of feelings, too, often ones we cannot do justice to with words. \u201cJewellery is a tangible sign of intangible feelings. As humans we like proof. When you ask someone, \u2018do you love me?\u2019, you expect \u2018yes\u2019, of course. And then you think, \u2018OK \u2013 but how many carats?\u2019\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t that a little \u2026 gauche? He shrugs. \u201cJewellery is a way of proving that you are ready to commit. Your wedding band is a talisman.\u201d He points to one of his own talismans, his Love bracelet, a gift from his wife on their 10th wedding anniversary. \u201cWhen I look at it I think of her,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is the power of jewellery.\u201d\n\nCartier platinum and diamond Panth\u00e8re ring. Supplied\n\nVigneron took over at Cartier in 2016, when the company was as close to disarray as it had ever been. The watch side of the business had tanked \u2013 pun firmly intended \u2013 spectacularly in China, causing global profits to slide by 45 per cent in the first half of that year.\n\nVigneron, who started with Cartier\u2019s parent group Richemont in 1988 and has worked for various parts of the business \u2013 as managing director of Cartier Japan and then Cartier Europe \u2013 promptly took action, buying back inventory from retailers, essentially increasing demand by decreasing supply. He also dusted off the brand's somewhat staid image by opening it up to a newer, younger audience.\n\nIn 2019, Richemont's jewellery division \u2013 mostly Cartier \u2013 achieved double-digit growth while the company's overall net profit rose 5 per cent to \u20ac1.94bn ($3.2bn).\n\n\u201cYou need to be hyper-local,\u201d Vigneron says. Previously, the company had been very centralised, but he pushed for each region to do things their own way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in California has nothing to do with what\u2019s happening in Sydney or Geneva,\u201d he says. \u201cWith luxury, the idea was always to have something central, and for everyone to agree to the same charter, everyone to be looking toward a single creative director. When Phoebe Philo took over Celine, she changed everything from the stores to the clothes to the uniform of the salespeople.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t say so explicitly, but the story of Celine is well known: when Philo left, her fans did, too. Cartier has no creative director, and local managers are supported to make the business their own.\n\nBridging the generation gap, too, has been paramount to Vigneron\u2019s success at the helm. In 2017, Cartier revived the Panth\u00e8re watch, originally launched in 1983. To celebrate the reissue, Cartier offered free repairs to all original Panth\u00e8res. That year, Cartier repaired as many Panth\u00e8res as it sold \u2013 about 15,000 worldwide.\n\nIn 2017, Cartier opened its biggest showcase of high jewellery in the US. Supplied\n\nIt must have been expensive, yes? \u201cIt cost a little bit,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cBut if you say, how much does it cost to have a communication campaign to convince young women to wear these watches, well \u2026 I think we spent the money wisely.\u201d The repair service was a natural way to speak to different generations at once, and \u2013 again \u2013 build a story around a product. \u201cWhat is the point of having this beautiful watch in a drawer, not being used?\u201d he asks.\n\nVigneron has also harnessed the power of publicity to broaden Cartier\u2019s reach. In 2017, it opened its biggest showcase of high jewellery in the US, with more than 500 pieces on display at its Mansion in New York.\n\nLater that year, the National Gallery of Australia staged an exhibition of 300 Cartier pieces, including tiaras owned by Queen Elizabeth, Princess Grace of Monaco\u2019s 10.48-carat diamond engagement ring and a necklace designed for Mexican actress Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix made of two entwined crocodiles, one covered in 1023 yellow diamonds, the other in 1060 emeralds.\n\nCartier is approachable but there is still a hierarchy. I bear the responsibility for the organisation. If it fails I have to leave. \u2014 Cyrille Vigneron, Cartier\n\n\u201cWe realised that the awareness of Cartier in Australia was generally quite low. People knew the Love bracelet and Juste un Clou, but not the high jewellery collection,\u201d Vigneron says. Some questioned whether a publicly funded art gallery should stage an exhibition promoting a luxury brand; Elizabeth Farrelly, writing in The Sydney Morning Herald, called it a \u201ctrade show of big-brand bling\u201d.\n\nVigneron disagrees. \u201cThis question, I think, is not really relevant when you think about the fact that Cartier actually is a maison producing art. We have some of the 20th century\u2019s finest examples of jewellery, these are treasures and we wanted to invite the public in to see them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proof, he says, is in the numbers. \u201cIf nobody came, that would be a problem. We did not have that problem.\u201d More than 200,000 visitors attended, with many queuing up to three hours to purchase tickets.\n\nAs a CEO, Vigneron seems affable and genuinely friendly with his staff. After watching him in action for a few days at the awards, and hearing numerous members of his staff \u2013 and several previous award recipients \u2013 gush about what a nice person he is, I venture that he seems quite egalitarian. He shakes his head. \u201cWe have to be careful with the term \u2018egalitarian\u2019. Cartier is close and approachable but there is still a hierarchy and different levels of responsibility. I bear the responsibility for the organisation. If it fails I have to leave.\u201d\n\nSo no, not everyone is equal. But, he says, he\u2019s not a believer in leaders being untouchable. Everyone is included at Cartier, he says. He regularly hosts \u201ctown hall meetings\u201d for the company, where staff are encouraged to ask questions without filter or fear. Nothing is off limits. Often, he says, the questions seem personal but can reveal deeper issues within the organisation.\n\nVigneron makes an effort to meet with young members of his team, inviting staff out to dinner.\n\n\u201cSomeone recently asked me about nepotism,\u201d he says. \u201cThey had this idea that only certain people were being promoted. So I said, \u2018well, you know, look at this senior team, there are five people here who were all appointed to those positions by different people and teams, so that\u2019s not nepotism\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe could have left it there, but he could see that what the person was really asking was, how do I get promoted? \u201cI thought, \u2018Is our promotion process unclear?\u2019 Because that is a real problem of transparency and mobility. So the question might be biased but there could be a real issue there.\u201d\n\nSo OK, he\u2019s not egalitarian, but he is remarkably down-to-earth for someone running the biggest brand inside Richemont. He plays classical guitar and has a keen interest in photography, posting pictures of his frequent travels to Cartier\u2019s company-wide Yammer group. He splits his time between Paris and Geneva, where his family lives, and is out the door early on Friday afternoons for date night with his wife.\n\nHe makes an effort to meet with young members of his team, inviting staff who have been with the company for less than four years out to dinner \u2013 he finds their perspective helpful. He is even part of the brand\u2019s book club. Lest I think he\u2019s involved in name only, Vigneron quickly adds that the club is currently reading Three Strong Women by renowned French author Marie NDiaye; before that, a book of essays called Factfulness.\n\nHe is active on Cartier\u2019s Yammer and encourages staff to message him there, aiming to reply to everyone within 24 hours. That\u2019s an ambitious goal for someone with such a busy role, I say, but Vigneron disagrees. \u201cI don\u2019t like that idea of the CEO being hidden away or that you can\u2019t talk to someone senior without knocking on a million doors,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not Cartier.\u201d\n\nAs we wind up our chat, I ask him if he could see a woman as the next CEO of the business; within Cartier, there is a rumour he is mentoring North American CEO Mercedes Abramo for the top job. \u201cWell, [that decision] doesn\u2019t belong to me. So far people are saying, we want you to stay. That\u2019s nice. But when the time comes, yes, I think that would be good. Investing in women is the best thing you can do.\u201d\n\nThe author travelled to San Francisco with assistance from Cartier.\n\nThe September issue of AFR Magazine is out on Friday, August 30 inside The Australian Financial Review.
