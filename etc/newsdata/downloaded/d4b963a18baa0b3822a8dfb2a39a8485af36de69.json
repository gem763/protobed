Arguably, however, none of these is as detrimental as the lure of junk food (stock photo)\n\nIn a new report, the organisation points out that our poorest streets are littered with these fast-food child-magnets, drawing a direct correlation with the fact children in these areas are twice as likely to be obese as those from more affluent parts of the country.\n\nAnd Unicef makes no secret of where the blame lies: \u2018The UK food retail environment encourages unhealthy foods consumption.\u2019\n\nThe UK has one of the highest rates of childhood obesity in the developed world, while one in eight new cases of type 2 diabetes is now someone aged 18 to 40.\n\nFor years, the debate about how to tackle this growing crisis focused on the perceived failings of parents who don\u2019t serve decent, nutritious meals at home.\n\nThis report changes all that. It confirms what many of us have said for a long time: we also need to tackle the targeting of children by junk-food shops, and do it fast.\n\nWhen, aged 16, I returned to the UK in the Eighties, I put on more than a stone in a few months.\n\nThe UK has one of the highest rates of childhood obesity in the developed world, while one in eight new cases of type 2 diabetes is now someone aged 18 to 40 (stock photo)\n\nHaving grown up in Italy, where fruit and vegetables were cheap, with Mars bars and fizzy drinks available only in specialist outlets, I was literally a kid in a candy shop. I marvelled at the sweets on display, and couldn\u2019t control myself.\n\nAnd the problem has got worse. Pop into WHSmith to buy a pen and it will try to sell you a gigantic chocolate bar for \u00a31, while, at the cinema, a mega-bucket of popcorn costs just a few pence more than a single portion.\n\nWe don\u2019t allow drug-pushers to operate openly at the school gates. So why are Greggs (which does an after-school deal of a pizza slice and a fizzy drink for \u00a32), KFC and the many copycats allowed to flog belly-busting fare with impunity?\n\nThe answer is simple: our entire food culture is topsy-turvy.\n\nHealthy, nutritious food is disproportionately expensive, while highly addictive stuff drowning in salt and sugar is cheap, plentiful and horribly convenient.\n\nUntil that reality is overturned, we will never put an end to the obesity epidemic that threatens the younger generation and is costing the NHS billions.\n\nSadly, these companies know their target markets. \u2018Poorer areas also have more visible advertising for unhealthy foods than wealthier areas,\u2019 says the Unicef report.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Government \u2014 and, in particular, local authorities which control food licences \u2014 must do more.\n\nThe soft drinks sugar tax is a start, but it\u2019s not enough. We must make it commercially unviable for certain types of food to be sold close to schools and offer incentives for healthier alternatives.\n\nOnly then might we have a hope of returning to a situation where a bag of chips and a chicken wing is a weekly treat \u2014 not a daily, and potentially deadly, indulgence down in the local food swamp.\n\nKylie's toxic pout\n\nWe hear endless chatter about the ills of toxic masculinity \u2014 but what about the toxic femininity that\u2019s warping the lives of young girls?\n\nThe news this week that ever-younger women \u2014 some even under 16 \u2014 are turning to Botox and fillers in pursuit of the Instagram-perfect \u2018rich girl\u2019 face is a case in point.\n\nJenner, a member of the Kardashian franchise, made her immense fortune selling lipgloss to impressionable teenagers seeking a pout like hers\n\nSince when did having a face like a sex doll become the pinnacle of female ambition? Since the success of \u2018influencers\u2019 such as the egregious Kylie Jenner, 22.\n\nJenner, a member of the Kardashian franchise, made her immense fortune (she is America\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire) selling lipgloss to impressionable teenagers seeking a pout like hers.\n\nOnly, of course, that pout wasn\u2019t hers at all, but the result of fillers, as before and after pictures of her clearly show.\n\nThe fact that her entire brand is built on such fundamental dishonesty tells you all you need to know about Jenner \u2014 and about the shallow world in which our girls are now forced to survive.\n\nBetrayal of a brave nurse\n\nEvery woman dreads having a smear test \u2014 and many will seek any excuse to avoid it. That\u2019s why the story of NHS nurse Julie O\u2019Connor, who died of cervical cancer after it was repeatedly missed at Southmead Hospital in Bristol, is so worrying.\n\nHer illness was spotted only when she eventually paid for a private test \u2014 by which time it was too late. She died earlier this year, aged just 49.\n\nThe long-overdue report into Mrs O\u2019Connor\u2019s case has now been published (seven months late) \u2014 but it covers only the period after March 2017, when the catalogue of mistakes was first identified, and not her initial misread smear test back in 2014, nor subsequent missed chances.\n\nIt is vitally important that North Bristol NHS Trust gets to the bottom of this. Not just for the sake of Mrs O\u2019Connor and her family, but for the sake of all women who will look at what happened to her and think: \u2018If a nurse can be so poorly treated by the health service, why bother at all?\u2019\n\nNice that a section 14 order has finally cleared Trafalgar Square of Extinction Rebellion protesters.\n\nI trust they will take with them all their plastic tents, single-use plastic water bottles, plastic bags and McDonald\u2019s wrappers.\n\nWhen, pray, did a simple statement of fact become \u2018hate speech\u2019?\n\nOxford police have been treating the appearance of stickers saying such things as \u2018Woman: noun. Adult human female\u2019 and \u2018Women don\u2019t have penises\u2019 as \u2018transphobic hate crimes\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m willing to admit, given the debate around gender identity, such signs could be interpreted as provocative.\n\nBut they are only words, not deeds. When my kids were small, I always took the view that if there was no blood and nothing was broken, it was probably fine.\n\nMaybe the police should do the same. They might even find they have the time to solve some proper crimes instead.\n\nGlad you\u2019re grey, Cliff!\n\nBe still, my beating pacemaker \u2014 Sir Cliff Richard is back on tour and looks sprightlier than ever.\n\nThis is thanks, in no small part, to his decision to stop dyeing his hair.\n\nThere does come a point when crowning a well- worn face with a full head of balayage serves only to make the subject look even more ancient. Mick Jagger, take note.\n\nSir Cliff Richard has announced he will tour the UK in 2020 to celebrate his 80th birthday\n\nThe Coleen Rooney/Rebekah Vardy debacle continues to grip the nation.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the endless parade of surgically enhanced WAGs lining up to take sides \u2014 it\u2019s also the fact that not since Alexis Carrington clashed with Krystle on Dynasty have we seen such a high-octane catfight.\n\nWhat puzzles me, though, is this: how on earth did Mrs Rooney find the time to mount such a forensic investigation into leaks from her Instagram feed while juggling all those exhausting foreign holidays? Truly, the woman is an example to us all.\n\nSurely John Sergeant lecturing BBC presenters (in the context of the Naga Munchetty Trump racism row) not to become \u2018personalities\u2019 cannot be the same John Sergeant who was once a contestant on TV\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing. Because that might open him up to all sorts of accusations of hypocrisy . . .\n\nPart of the reason why some parents are reluctant to vaccinate children is because so few can remember how awful diseases such as mumps and measles are.\n\nI had mumps as a young child \u2014 not only that, I gave it to my mum, who was pregnant with my brother at the time.\n\nI can still remember how thoroughly miserable we both were, her in particular.\n\nMeasles is far nastier and can cause blindness, while rubella can lead to devastating problems in unborn children. Vaccinations are like antibiotics \u2014 we take them for granted, but the world would be a much harsher place without them.\n\nNot enough fuss has been made about Eliud Kipchoge, who ran a marathon in under two hours for the first time. It\u2019s an extraordinary achievement, one that most of us could only dream of \u2014 though I can eat a Marathon in under two minutes, if that counts.", "description": "SARAH VINE: Today's youngsters are exposed to a stream of seductive marketing, from pop music to video games.
