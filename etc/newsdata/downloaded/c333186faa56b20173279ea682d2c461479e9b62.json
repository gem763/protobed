That's the highest-grossing opening for an R-rated film this year and the second biggest debut in the history of September. But the film brought in $32 million less than the opening of the original film, which made a record $123 million two years ago.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., \"Chapter Two\" is also the second largest opening for a horror movie ever behind the original \"It.\" The film made $185 million globally this weekend.\n\nThe movie, which is based on the Stephen King bestseller and stars Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy, exceeded industry expectations, however. It was expected to bring in $85 to $90 million this weekend.\n\n\"Chapter Two\" had a strong opening, but its lengthy run time could have held back its ticket sales.
