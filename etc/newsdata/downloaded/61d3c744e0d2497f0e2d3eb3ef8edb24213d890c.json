REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/Files\n\nLast month, Taiwan\u2019s markets received about $2.9 billion of foreign investment, on optimism over its economy, as a growing number of local firms were shifting their factories back home from mainland China, seen as aiding their export revenues.\n\nIndian equities attracted about $1.1 billion worth of foreign inflows thanks to a corporate tax cut announced by the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to boost manufacturing and private investment.\n\nHowever, investors withdrew money from other markets on concerns over slowing global trade and the prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war.\n\nSouth Korea, Indonesia and Thailand recorded outflows of $874 million, $519 million and $379 million, respectively, last month, the exchange data showed.\n\nPhilippines and Vietnam were the other markets which saw outflows in September.\n\nInvestors\u2019 focus has shifted to the next round of U.S.-China trade negotiations in Washington on Oct. 10-11 to see if the two sides can end a bruising trade war that has raised fears of recession.\n\n\u201cUncertainty is high and news flow has been mixed, with China\u2019s new purchase of U.S. agriculture products coming together with speculation on a potential U.S. crackdown on portfolio flows into China,\u201d said J.P.Morgan in a report on Monday.\n\nAt the end of last month, Reuters reported that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nJingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist with financial services firm IG, expects further turbulence in Asian stocks, saying a lack of positive news from the trade talks may\n\nbe seen by investors as opening the way for more tariffs.\n\nWashington had delayed an Oct. 1 tariff hike as a goodwill gesture ahead of the talks, but has said it would go ahead with the plan from Oct. 15, with another move slated for Dec. 15.\n\n\u201cFrom a valuation perspective, Asia markets should have room to gain. That said, the event risks this month are in abundance which could keep foreign investors on the sidelines until the end of the month when there could be greater clarity,\u201d she added.", "description": "India and Taiwan equities received strong foreign inflows in September due to some local factors, but other regional markets saw outflows on concerns over the U.S.-China trade war and slowing economic growth.", "authors": ["Gaurav Dogra", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438022149&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960L2", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
