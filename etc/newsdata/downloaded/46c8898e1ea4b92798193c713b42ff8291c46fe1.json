He once accompanied his father on a work trip to China and appeared to further those ties during that trip.\n\nThe poll surveyed 900 adults contacted via mobile phones and landlines from September 26 to October 3 and had a 3.3-point margin of error. The poll\u2019s Ukraine-related questions reflect the views of a subset of 748 people.\n\nMeanwhile, the poll showed that Trump was not being significantly affected by Democrat calls to impeach him after a whistleblower complaint expressed concerns he was withholding military aid in exchange for help with the 2020 elections.\n\nThe poll showed that as a result of the impeachment inquiry, 15 percent said they were more likely to vote for Trump, while 18 percent said they were more likely to vote against him.\n\nIn addition, Trump has made gains against Biden in a head-to-head matchup.\n\nBiden led Trump 54 to 42 percent in September but now only leads Trump 51 percent to 44 percent. There are big gains towards Trump from independents. Biden led Trump 55 to 37 percent in September \u2014 an 18 percentage point lead, but that has dropped to 46 to 45 percent \u2014 only a one percentage point lead.\n\nTrump also gained with self-described investors. They favor Biden over Trump by two percentage points at 49 to 47 percent, but that is down from an 11 percentage point lead at 54 to 43 percent in September.\n\nStill, the poll also showed that 50 percent of those surveyed thought Trump asking the Ukrainian president to help investigate Biden is an impeachable offense, while 46 percent do not. Independents were split, with 46 percent saying it was an impeachment offense versus 47 who said it was not.\n\nMore \u2014 55 percent \u2014 support the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into Trump, with independents supporting it at 53 percent to 45 percent.\n\nBut the poll also showed that Trump\u2019s job approval rating has actually risen in October, despite calls for his impeachment. The IBD/TIPP poll found that his approval rating climbed from 39 percent to 43 percent during the month.\n\nForty-eight percent approved of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, versus 39 percent that did not.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "A poll showed that 57% of respondents support a probe on Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden regarding their actions in Ukraine and China.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/joe-biden-hunter-biden-2010-4-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
