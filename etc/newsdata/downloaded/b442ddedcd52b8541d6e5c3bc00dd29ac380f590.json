He loved sports and spending time with his family, and he was planning for college.\n\nThings came to a halt last year when he went in for a yearly checkup and his bloodwork revealed he had aplastic anemia, a rare, life-threatening blood disease that leaves those who have it feeling fatigued with uncontrollable bleeding.\n\nSantos said, \u201cI was getting a lot of nosebleeds but I didn\u2019t really think I felt anything wrong.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Jack Santos\n\nIn order to survive, he would need a bone marrow transplant. And while finding a match can be challenging, Santos\u2019 siblings got tested and his older sister, Shelby, was the perfect match.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to see him go through something like this,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cIt was terrifying, but we were ready for whatever brought with it at the time.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Jack Santos\n\nOn September 12, 2018, she became her brother\u2019s bone marrow donor.\n\n\u201cShelby saved my life,\u201d said Santos, now 19.\n\nToday the two siblings are healthy and Shelby is even engaged to her fiance, Garrett.\n\nCourtesy Jack Santos\n\nSo when Make-A-Wish offered Santos a wish to fulfill, he immediately wanted to thank his sister for her selfless act.\n\nWith Shelby and Garrett set to tie the knot in 2020, Santos asked to use his wish to give Shelby a honeymoon.\n\n\"I could never really ever fully repay you,\" Santos said to his sister live on \"Good Morning America\" Wednesday. \"As you know Make-A-Wish granted me a wish before I went into treatment last year.\"\n\n\"I was racking my brain thinking about what I wanted to do. I couldn\u2019t really figure it out,\" he said. \"I reached out to them and they are generous enough to allow me to send you guys on a honeymoon of your choice.\"\n\nSantos surprised Shelby with a five-night luxury vacation at any Sandals Resorts of her choice.\n\nABCNews.com\n\n\"I am obviously in shock,\" said Shelby, who plans to wed next September. \"This is something that Jack has been having to go through so for him to give [his wish] up and give to me, is just, he didn\u2019t have to do that and it\u2019s amazing.\"\n\n\"He\u2019s the youngest and he\u2019s always been my little baby brother so I\u2019ve always wanted to help him through life and I never thought I could do it this way,\" she said. \"I\u2019m so just beyond grateful that I could.\"\n\nToday also marked Robin Roberts\u2019 \u201cbirthday\u201d from her bone marrow transplant seven years ago.
