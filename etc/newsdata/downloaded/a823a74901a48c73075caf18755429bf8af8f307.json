A song has even been released mocking his penalty miss.\n\n\"[It was] one of the worst days of my life,\" Bangura told the BBC on Monday while holed-up in his bedroom. \"I can't even go outside because I didn't expect this kind of hostility towards me.\n\n\"I did my job by stepping up as the captain to take the spot kick,\" he added. \"I am really disappointed. But at the same time I wish to say sorry [and] beg for their forgiveness.\"\n\nHad Bangura scored, Sierra Leone would have levelled the two-legged tie 3-3 and gone through to the next stage on away goals.\n\nImage copyright Red Cross Sierra Leone Image caption Fans also threw stones at Red Cross ambulances after the match\n\nRed Cross staff also came under attack outside the stadium after they were accused of whisking Bangura away from fans, the BBC's Umaru Fofana says.\n\nFour Red Cross volunteers were injured in the unrest.

He is our captain [and] football is a game of chance.\"\n\nMr Nyelenkeh added: \"[Hooliganism] is becoming unprecedented. I think measures should be put in place to combat it.\"", "description": "Angry fans of Sierra Leone pelt the captain's house with stones after he missed a decisive penalty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10646/production/_108724176_gettyimages-1125014108.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
