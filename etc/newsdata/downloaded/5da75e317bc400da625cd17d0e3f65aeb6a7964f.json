They investigated themselves. That doesn't work.\n\n'Fox News had an outside investigator. CBS had an outside investigator. NPR, the NFL. This is how it's done. You get somebody on the outside.'\n\nMegyn Kelly took aim at her former employer on Wednesday as she called for NBC to authorize an 'outside investigation' in the wake of the Matt Lauer scandal\n\nCarlson teed up the topic for Kelly by noting that NBC used internal employees to investigate how claims of sexual misconduct were handled at the network.\n\n'There's a question of the faith and confidence of the public and the reporting of NBC on matters involving itself. To me as a lawyer, it's just always better if you send it outside,' said Kelly.\n\n'Then people can have more faith in it and if there's nothing to hide, you have no worries about it. You have nothing to worry about.'\n\nCarlson then asked Kelly if she felt NBC News president Noah Oppenheim should or would be fired.\n\nThe embattled host told Tucker Carlson Tonight that NBC needed to launch an external investigation into how claims of sexual misconduct were handled at the network\n\nFormer Today host Matt Lauer (pictured) was accused of forcibly kissing and raping TV producer Brook Nevils in Ronan Farrow's book Catch and Kill\n\n'No comment on that. I will say the question is open as to whether they put dollars ahead of decency,' replied Kelly.\n\n'If they were more interested in protecting their star anchor than protecting the women of the company.'\n\nCarlson later cancelled a pre-taped segment featuring Dennis Rodman to speak more with Kelly about her life after NBC.\n\nThere was no mention of the pro-blackface comments that led to Kelly's extended time off the air, or of the $69 million she pocketed despite being terminated just 13 months into a three-year contract.\n\n'I left Fox News in January of '17 and the reason I left is because I wanted to be with my family. I was missing my kids' childhood. They were little. Seven, five, three. I could still see it and be part of it,' said Kelly.\n\n'Now I'm doing it. I've spent the past year in particular but even before that, with them and I am mothering my own kids. There is no substitute for that.'\n\nTucker Carlson noted that NBC used internal employees to investigate how claims of sexual misconduct were handled at the network\n\nKelly did not make any concrete accusations against NBC as she discussed Ronan Farrow and his reporting on the program, and instead peddled a laundry list of hypothetical scenarios throughout the interview.\n\n'As I watched the Ronan story unfold, the one thing I wanted to know is what did they know and when did they know it,' Kelly told Carlson, referring to the Lauer scandal at NBC.\n\n'I had been reporting on the story even while I was at NBC. I talked to Ronan. I talked to his producer Rich McHugh, I talked to Rose McGowan. I talked to many Harvey Weinstein victims and accusers and was getting to the bottom of what NBC knew while I was there. And then just independently.'\n\nShe added: 'The question is what did they know about Matt Lauer prior to the time the woman came forward who was ultimately his downfall?'\n\nThere was no mention of the pro-blackface comments that led to Kelly's extended time off the air in the interview\n\nFormer Today host Lauer - who lost his job in November 2017 - was accused of forcibly kissing and raping TV producer Brooke Nevils in Farrow's book Catch and Kill, the BBC reported.\n\nLauer denies the allegation, which Nevils said took place in February 2014 while the pair were in Russia covering the Winter Olympics.\n\nLater in the interview, Carlson asked Kelly if it was plausible that NBC had no knowledge about Lauer's history of sexual misconduct.\n\n'If they had no settlements of any kind and no complaints about Matt Lauer prior to Brooke Nevils coming forward, sure, it might be. But is it true?' asked Kelly.\n\nShe then said that the network could have hidden these settlements using an 'enhanced severance.'\n\nKelly explained: 'That's the situation where the receptionist is suddenly getting a seven-figure goodbye.\n\n'The number one thing that needs to happen now is they need to release any and all Matt Lauer accusers from their confidentiality agreements. NBC says it has nothing to hide. Great. Let's not hide anything,' said Kelly.\n\n'Show us all of the agreements, the enhanced severance agreements reached or at least the number so we can see which ones pop out and which ones are super high. Are they all women? Do they all have a connection with Matt Lauer? Release the women from their confidentiality obligations.'", "description": "The embattled host, who was fired 13 months into a three-year contract with the network, told Tucker Carlson Tonight that NBC needs to launch an external investigation.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/09/19825172-0-image-a-13_1571300231705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
