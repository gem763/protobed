She\u2019s extremely smart, but she\u2019s naive like that. She\u2019s feeling betrayed by the Boris camp now.\u201d\n\nJoe has spoken at length to 34-year-old Jennifer since her links to the PM emerged a fortnight ago.\n\n(Image: Rowan Griffiths/Daily Mirror)\n\nHe added: \u201cShe was hoping Boris was going to be like a knight in shining armour and come to her rescue. It took her a while to understand politicians run to the hills when s*** hits the fan.\u201d\n\nLast month, it was revealed Ms Arcuri had received \u00a3126,000 of public money for her business ventures, some of which was paid while Mr Johnson, 55, was London Mayor.\n\nIt was also revealed he visited her London flat \u2013 which had a dancing pole \u2013 for \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d.\n\nMs Arcuri, who moved to California last year with her British partner Matthew Hickey and their daughter, is also alleged to have received preferential treatment when she went on three overseas trade missions led by Mr Johnson.\n\n(Image: Rowan Griffiths)\n\n(Image: Rowan Griffiths/Daily Mirror)\n\nAnd there are now four inquiries into whether the PM broke rules by doing favours for Ms Arcuri. Mr Johnson has said there was no interest to declare.\n\nDigital Minister Matt Warman has ordered a review into how a \u00a3100,000 grant was awarded in January to Hacker House, run by Ms Arcuri, and has frozen the unpaid \u00a353,000 part of the grant.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe, 60 \u2013 who claims Jennifer was also pals with the PM\u2019s estranged wife Marina \u2013 said he has helped broker an interview with Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan. The chat, set to be aired tomorrow, is likely to address a string of key questions\n\nJoe has also contacted attorney Marty Singer, Hollywood\u2019s go-to lawyer for reputation management advice.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnd Jennifer\u2019s long-time pal and lawyer Michael Walsh \u2013 also dealing with negotiations to sell her story \u2013 bizarrely claimed her exclusive interview will refer to \u201ca pending dinner\u201d with ex-US President Bill Clinton\u2019s former mistress Monica Lewinsky.\n\nMr Johnson also faces claims he groped a female journalist 20 years ago, which he denies. But he refuses to say whether he and Ms Arcuri had a fling.\n\nBut in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror in Huntington Beach, LA, last week, she claimed the rumours were \u201ccomplete b******t\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cThis is not a Monica Lewinsky. The allegations are false and I am a legitimate businesswoman. He spoke at my event. He\u2019s been after me forever.\n\n\"Men just trip over themselves in front of me. They fall in love with me in about 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nLater she told Bloomberg TV: \u201cI will not be the person to bring Johnson down. He didn\u2019t do me any favours. I was within my rights to go on those trade missions and apply for grants.\n\n\"My relationship with him is nobody\u2019s business.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The US businesswoman has been left 'pretty fragile' by the storm and her ex-boyfriend says she thought Boris would come to her aid", "authors": ["Patrick Hill", "Image", "Rowan Griffiths Daily Mirror", "Rowan Griffiths", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469142.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jennifer-Arcuri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
