The crashes killed a total of 346 people.\n\nRead more: The complete history of the 737 Max, Boeing's promising yet problematic workhorse jet\n\nPreliminary reports from investigations into the two crashes suggested that there were problems with the sensor readings.\n\nIn both flights, the planes nosedived and pilots were unable to regain control.\n\nObjects recovered from the sea at Tanjung Priok Port, Indonesia, after the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max crash in October 2018.

Peter DeFazio, the chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, also said that his committee's investigation into the 737 Max would look at how its software relied on a single sensor.\n\nThe cockpit of a Boeing 737 Max plane. Ted S. Warren/Associated Press\n\nBoeing has since defended its design. In response to the CNN report, a spokesperson said that \"single sources of data are considered acceptable in such cases by our industry.\"\n\nBut Boeing in its actions appears to see a benefit in a second sensor. The company is updating the 737 Max design, and said that its update will incorporate data from two sensors instead of just one.\n\nThe plane will not fly again until regulators in the US and around the world approve Boeing's fixes \u2014 a process that most in the industry do not expect to be completed until the end of 2019 at the earliest.\n\nSources for The Wall Street Journal said this fix will make the MCAS system in the Max plane more similar to the one in the military jet.\n\nRead more: 400 pilots have joined a growing number of airlines in demanding payback from Boeing for its 737 Max disasters \u2014 here's the full list\n\nA Boeing spokesman declined to explain to The Wall Street Journal why the systems are different on the two planes. The spokesman said said: \"The systems are not directly comparable.\"\n\nKenyans mourn family and friends, who were victims of the Boeing 737 Max Ethiopian Airlines plane crash, at the crash scene in March. REUTERS/Baz Ratner\n\nAn Air Force official and other unnamed sources told the Journal that the military refuelling jet with the MCAS system also has another safeguard, which lets pilots override the system by pulling on the controls.\n\nWill Roper, an assistant Air Force secretary who serves as the branch's procurement chief, said: \"We have better sensor data.\"\n\n\"But most importantly, when the pilot grabs the stick, the pilot is completely in control.\"\n\nMax pilots have criticized Boeing for what they described as a plane design that lessens their control over the plane, in ways they say they were told of in advance.\n\nRead more: The Boeing 737 Max could be grounded through the holidays thanks to a series of new delays, and airlines are cancelling thousands of flights because of it\n\nAmerican Airlines pilots confronted Boeing executives about the MCAS system in November 2018, after the first crash but before the second.\n\nOne pilot said: \"These guys didn't even know the damn system was on the airplane, nor did anybody else.\"\n\nBoeing is currently facing lawsuits from the families of those killed on the planes, as well as federal investigations and demands for compensation from airlines around the world who have had their planes grounded and unable to fly since March.\n\nThe 737 Max has 'no value' after 2 deadly crashes as passengers no longer trust the plane, the lawyer for an aviation firm suing Boeing says", "description": "The MCAS software relied on just one sensor on the 737 Max.
