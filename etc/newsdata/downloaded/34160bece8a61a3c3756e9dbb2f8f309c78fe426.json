It\u2019s an unwelcome addition to the controversies he\u2019s already confronting from both inside and outside NBC over his alleged quashing of stories that exposed sexual misconduct by powerful men who have done business with the Peacock Network.\n\nSeveral NBC News staffers this week expressed outrage that Oppenheim and his wife Allison have been benefiting from NBC\u2019s on-air promotion of apparently lucrative side projects on which Today show star Savannah Guthrie has been collaborating with the boss\u2019 wife.\n\nAnd while Oppenheim has faced calls for his dismissal, with a women\u2019s rights group scheduled to rally outside 30 Rockefeller Plaza on Wednesday, he\u2019s found an ally in Guthrie. The Daily Beast has confirmed that Guthrie and Today co-host Hoda Kotb recently defended Oppenheim, and urged that he be kept on, to NBCUniversal chairman Steve Burke.\n\nOver the past two years, Guthrie and Allison Oppenheim, a clinical psychologist, have co-authored two bestselling children\u2019s books\u2014Princesses Wear Pants and its sequel, Princesses Save the World\u2014both of which received aggressive and repeated promotion on various hours of the Today show. The books are being developed into an animation series by Drew Barrymore\u2019s production company, and have inspired a \u201cPrincess\u201d-branded kids\u2019 pajama set that recently went on sale, along with copies of their first book, at Nordstrom department stores.\n\nOppenheim\u2019s use of NBC\u2019s airwaves to promote personal projects dates back more than a decade, when he was a Today show senior producer and hawking what he called his \u201cbathroom and bedside book,\u201d The Intellectual Devotional, and, a year later, a sequel focused on American history\u2014both of which received precious on-air attention in segments hosted by Matt Lauer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d an NBC News veteran told The Daily Beast. \u201cFor Oppenheim, or any news executive for that matter, to use the programs over which he has control to hawk his own book, or the book that his wife co-wrote with Today anchor Savannah Guthrie, is wrong on so many levels.\u201d\n\nThis person, one of several who criticized Oppenheim, asked not to be identified out of fear of possible retaliation. \u201cIt\u2019s unethical, self-serving and goes against the policies they ask all NBC News employees to abide by,\u201d the news division veteran added.\n\nAn NBC News spokesperson defended the Oppenheims\u2019 use of NBC programming to flog their books as standard in the television industry. To be sure, such on-air personalities as ABC\u2019s Robin Roberts and Amy Robach, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, CBS\u2019s Gayle King and ABC\u2019s Michael Strahan\u2014to say nothing of chief ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2019s comedian-wife, Ali Wentworth\u2014have hawked books on their respective networks.\n\nBy comparison, however, the Oppenheims are virtually unknown to the public.\n\n\u201cLiterally every anchor and reporter, on every show, on every network, has promoted their book on their air, since television was invented,\u201d the NBC News spokesperson emailed The Daily Beast. \u201cSavannah Guthrie and Allison Oppenheim co-authored 2 children\u2019s books \u2013 focused on female empowerment \u2013 which were featured exactly as much as the books of countless colleagues, and with Allison\u2019s relationship always fully disclosed.\u201d\n\nThis latest flap is erupting at a moment when former NBC News correspondent Ronan Farrow\u2019s just-published book Catch & Kill depicts Oppenheim, as well as NBC News and MSNBC Chairman Andy Lack, as capitulating to a pressure campaign by disgraced studio executive Harvey Weinstein to quash Farrow\u2019s reporting on his serial sexual misconduct, and also of toning down a rape allegation against fired Today show anchor Lauer.\n\n\u201c Lauer joked on-air that [Oppenheim\u2019s] book should actually be called \u2018Noah Needs a Summer House.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn addition, human rights activist and former fashion model Sil Lai Abrams wrote a detailed account in The Daily Beast on Monday of how NBC and NBC News executives thwarted MSNBC anchor Joy Reid\u2019s meticulously reported story about Abrams\u2019 sexual assault accusations against hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons and Extra television personality A.J. Calloway. After NBC passed on the scoop following several delays for fact-checking and internal legal reviews, the details of Abrams\u2019 allegations were published by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nNBC News\u2019 refusal to publish the story was revealing in its similarity to Oppenheim\u2019s decision, along with Lack\u2019s, not to air Ronan Farrow\u2019s Weinstein reporting\u2014which he turned, less than two months later, into a Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker article.\n\nHowever, the controversies surrounding the 41-year-old Oppenheim, including his decades-old undergraduate musings about sexual politics in the Harvard Crimson\u2014for which he recently apologized after they were detailed by The Daily Beast\u2014have yet to threaten his or Lack\u2019s job security.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Burke and NBC\u2019s parent company Comcast recently renewed Oppenheim\u2019s contract and view him as the successor to Lack, who, at 72, is staying in his perch through the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe news prompted a demand from the advocacy group UltraViolet\u2014which describes its mission as one \u201cto fight sexism and create a more inclusive world that accurately represents all women\u201d\u2014that Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts reverse the decision to re-up Oppenheim.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply disturbing that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts would show such poor judgment and renew its contract with Noah Oppenheim knowing full well that he was facing allegations of enabling sexual abusers in the workplace and had a record of silencing survivors and stories of survivors in the newsroom,\u201d declared UltraViolet executive director Shaunna Thomas.\n\n\u201cThe rot at Comcast clearly goes to the top\u2014with the media giant caring more about short-term profits than about protecting its employees and safeguarding long-term shareholder value,\u201d Thomas continued. \u201cThis is a mistake that Comcast and NBC Universal will regret.\u201d\n\nRich McHugh, who was Farrow\u2019s reporting partner and producer, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a group of prominent women in the TV biz\u2014including former Today anchor Megyn Kelly and former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson, who helped end Roger Ailes\u2019 sexually hostile reign at Fox\u2014signed an open letter calling for an independent investigation of the way NBC News execs dealt with the Matt Lauer allegations. The network cleared itself after an in-house review.\n\n\u201cMany have called for an independent, outside investigation into what happened here,\u201d McHugh continued, \u201cand that seems like a good idea, especially now.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, Guthrie\u2019s and Kotb\u2019s support has apparently secured Oppenheim\u2019s future at NBC.\n\n\u201cUnless the talent turns on Noah, nothing is going to change,\u201d an NBC source told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cSavannah and Hoda paint themselves as female leaders. Then I read they support Noah, and that Savannah is in business with his wife,\u201d a different NBC staffer told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019m very angry.\u201d A female Today producer said: \u201cWomen are apoplectic.\u201d\n\nAn NBC insider sympathetic to Oppenheim retorted: \u201cA lot of women\u2014and men\u2014at NBC are apoplectic about all of the false allegations being hurled at our organization.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Guthrie\u2019s defense of her boss is unsurprising, considering her co-authorship and business relationship with Allison Oppenheim.\n\nThe first book in the their saga, titled Princesses Wear Pants, was published on Sept. 12, 2017 and was the subject of at least more than a handful of NBC segments cheering its release. Six months before it hit shelves, Today show correspondent Jenna Bush Hager labeled the book among her \u201cfavorite things\u201d in an interview while Guthrie noted her co-author \u201chappens to be married to our boss.\u201d\n\nOn the day of release, Guthrie and Oppenheim\u2019s book got two separate Today show segments. In one, Lauer ribbed his co-host over her business connections to the boss\u2019 wife: \u201cCan we mention right off the bat that Allie is actually married to Noah Oppenheim who is the president of NBC News? So this was an extremely tough booking to accomplish,\u201d he joked. In another, Kotb told viewers to \u201cgo out and get this book\u201d after noting that \u201cAlli happens to be married to a very important man, Noah Oppenheim, who\u2019s the president of NBC News.\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks later, after Princesses rocketed up the charts, the Today show gushed over a star-studded book party. \u201cIt has really captivated people,\u201d Kotb said of the Oppenheim-Guthrie collaboration. A week later, Megyn Kelly featured the book on her Today third-hour talk show and interviewed the pair as part of \u201cNational Kick Butt Day.\u201d\n\nThe incestuous Today show coverage repeated itself last year, with the morning program revealing on-air in early May the book cover of the Oppenheim-Guthrie sequel, entitled Princesses Save the World. Upon being published in September 2018, the follow-up received several glowing Today segments, including one announcing that Drew Barrymore\u2019s production company will develop the Princess Penelope into an animated series.\n\nMore recently, Nordstrom began selling a $50 bundle featuring the first Princesses book along with a two-piece pajama set featuring printed artwork from the book. The Nordstrom deal is said to have been made under a third-party licensing agreement under which Guthrie and Oppenheim receive \u201cnominal\u201d compensation.\n\nBeyond his wife\u2019s business connections to Guthrie, NBC staffers have noted that Oppenheim\u2014who once briefly left the outlet for a successful screenwriting career\u2014has long seemed to use his perches atop the network to promote his own outside work.\n\n\u201cEverything is another commercial for these people,\u201d one NBC insider lamented to The Daily Beast.\n\nIn October 2006, when Oppenheim\u2014then senior producer of the Today show\u2014published the first trivia-focused The Intellectual Devotional, he and his co-author David Kidder got their own promotional interview on the morning show along with the Matt Lauer stamp of approval.\n\n\u201cFull disclosure, we should mention that Noah is actually a senior producer here,\u201d Lauer said during the effusive segment, joking: \u201cThat means you don't get to talk at all.\u201d The anchor noted that Oppenheim wrote \u201c99 percent of the book\u201d and his co-author quipped that his own name was on the book simply for \u201cinventor credit.\u201d\n\nA year later, in 2007, Oppenheim\u2019s second installment of the Intellectual Devotional series\u2014this time focused on American history\u2014received two full segments of promotion on the Today show, including a lengthy interview and an excerpt/quiz posted to the show\u2019s website.\n\nEven then, it was apparent to Lauer that Oppenheim had his eyes on bigger prizes beyond his day job. \u201cFull disclosure, we should mention that Noah used to be a producer here on the Today show. Oh, you\u2019re still a producer here? You\u2019ve got so many other projects, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d the anchor roasted his boss.\n\nLauer also joked on-air that the book should actually be called \u201cNoah Needs a Summer House.\u201d\n\nAnd later in the show, while appearing in a kitchen segment with Ann Curry to promote his book, Curry prodded Oppenheim: \u201cAnd how did you get two appearances on the Today show?\u201d\n\nOver the next two years, even after he\u2019d briefly left NBC for a Hollywood development gig at Reveille, Oppenheim appeared on the Today show four more times to promote newer installments in his book series, again coinciding with quiz excerpts posted to the show\u2019s digital home.", "description": "The NBC News chief\u2019s wife wrote a book with \u2018Today\u2019 show anchor Savannah Guthrie, who pushed the network to keep him on despite recent controversy.", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Lachlan Cartwright", "Andrew Kirell", "Editor At Large", "Senior Reporter", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571797133/191022-oppenheim-nbc-tease_blq0kw", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
