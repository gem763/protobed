The cause of early menopause is not known, so if you start to notice any symptoms, consult your GP.\u2019\n\nOn the subject of how long menopause typically lasts, Stephanie said: \u2018On average, women can expect to experience symptoms of the menopause for around four years, although some have been known to last as long as 12 years.\u2019\n\nAccording to the NHS, the severity of the symptoms people going through menopause will experience will vary, and symptoms often begin months or years before the menstruation stops altogether. This is known as perimenopause.\n\nStephanie said: \u2018The menopause (and perimenopause which predates it) is highly complex; there is so much more to it than the well-known symptoms of night sweats, memory loss and hot flushes but in most cases, these are the signs women think they should be looking out for. That\u2019s why other, subtler or seemingly unrelated changes to the body \u2013 like dry skin, incontinence, toothache, vaginal dryness or late-onset allergies \u2013 can end up being dismissed.\u2019\n\nShe also highlighted the importance of people going through menopause not suffering alone.\n\nShe said: \u2018Menopause is a confusing time for many women experiencing the changes that come as a result of falling oestrogen levels. During this time, it is important that women don\u2019t feel embarrassed and seek help if they are struggling with their symptoms and are concerned about the impact on their physical and mental health.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Metro.co.uk spoke to Ebony, who was going through the menopause herself at the time. When asked what she wanted women to understand about menopause, she said: \u2018This is a time when we should shamelessly take care of our personal needs.\n\n\u2018We sweat a lot throughout the day, so our skin can become dry, and our bones could become brittle. We get aches and pains. We feel heavier. It\u2019s important that women talk about these symptoms and are open about them.\n\n\u2018As soon as we are having that conversation we are removing stigma, and when women know what to expect \u2013 it takes aways a huge amount of the associated worry and anxiety. It happens to every woman.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Menopause lies in many of our pasts, presents and futures.
