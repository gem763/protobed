Well, Reed says that evangelicals have a duty to defend the incumbent Republican leader against \u201cthe stridently anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and pro-abortion agenda of the progressive left.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official was quoted in Politico explaining why Trump resonates so much with his evangelical base.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason why many religious leaders support Trump is because he is great on life, religious freedom, judges, Israel, taxes, conscience protections, fetal issue and also because Hillary Clinton and his would-be opponents next year are so awful on all of the above,\u201d the official said.\n\nHis approach is clearly working, with 81% of self-described white, born-again or evangelical Christians having voted for Trump in 2016, according to Pew. Reed\u2019s group, specifically, invested $18 million in get-out-the-vote efforts during the midterms and has warned conservative Christians \u201cpretty much everything\u201d is on the line in 2020.\n\nOf course, not all religious leaders are on board:", "description": "Faith and Freed Coalition founder Ralph Reed is coming out with a book next year ahead of the general election in which he defends Trump against \u201cthe...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS967_trump_MG_20191009122825.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
