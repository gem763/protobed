But 10 days later Ramos played a full match against Castres on Saturday in the French Top 14 league.\n\n\u201cI would like to talk about one case in particular, Thomas Ramos, and clear it up \u2026 The diagnosis, the (X-ray) images, were the same here as in Toulouse: a period of 10 days out. But it can be nine, or 11, you never know,\u201d Brunel said Sunday in Oita. \u201cWe needed (our) backs 100% fit. We had 72 hours to assess his case before bringing a replacement in, it\u2019s a completely different context when you\u2019re with your club.\u201d\n\nBrunel stood by his decision not to wait any longer before deciding Ramos could not stay on with the squad in Japan.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait until the eve of the game or the morning itself to know if a player is fit to play or not. You can\u2019t do things the way you do them at a club,\u201d Brunel said. \u201cIt was my role to replace the player or not, I took on this responsibility.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ramos was backup to veteran Maxime Medard, replacing him meant losing an accomplished goal kicker who could be dangerous coming off the bench in a tight game.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t amuse me to send Thomas back to France when he\u2019s maybe our best kicker,\u201d Brunel said. \u201cExcept that I had this context to take care of. I think it was the best decision for our team, I don\u2019t know if others would have done things differently.\u201d\n\nThree-time runner-up France, which finished second in Pool C behind England, faces Pool D winner Wales in the quarterfinals in Oita.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "France head coach Jacques Brunel has defended his decision to send injured Thomas Ramos home from the Rugby World Cup, even though the fullback played this weekend for his club side.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
