Once you get the hang of it, even \u00a3170 million can go very quickly indeed . . .\n\nBILLIONAIRES' ROW\n\nThere\u2019s a special place in London for the uber-rich. The Bishops Avenue \u2014 a tree-lined, bulletproof, security-heavy half-mile in East Finchley known as Billionaires\u2019 Row or \u2018The Chavenue\u2019 \u2014 is all about wealth, excess and displaying it in the showiest way possible.\n\nThis \u00a335 million property is just the ticket for a rookie multi-millionaire, although for the same amount again, you could knock the whole lot down and build your own mega-mansion.\n\nBishops Avenue in East Finchley is all about wealth, excess and displaying it in the showiest way possible (pictured, a property on the road)\n\nCHECK OUT MY COAT\n\nBurberry\u2019s check basketweave ribbon coat is tailored in Italy from velvet, satin and grosgrain ribbon in classic Burberry check with a contrasting collar.\n\nOK, it isn\u2019t terribly practical \u2014 the heavily textured finish is prone to snagging and it is only suitable for a specialist clean \u2014 but who cares when you can afford to just buy another one?\n\nFELINE FANCY\n\nNo one will ignore you at a party when you\u2019re wearing this sequined tiger mini-dress by Balmain.

Not forgetting the extra \u00a310 million to personalise it and \u00a32 million to run it for a year.\n\nBrand-new private jets range in price from \u00a32 million to around \u00a370 million. Perhaps this is where you can exercise some financial restraint.

Just \u00a3399 buys a Polo & Tweed butler for the day. Your very own Jeeves will arrive in full livery, complete with white gloves, and tend your every need, from champagne pouring to silver polishing, bath drawing to wardrobe valeting.\n\nAnd, with all that money, you\u2019ll need round-the-clock security, so hire a live-in bodyguard \u2014 or two.
