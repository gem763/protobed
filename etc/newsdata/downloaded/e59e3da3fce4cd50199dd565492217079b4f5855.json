Farmer's Daughter Ilma Afroz Defies All Odds To Crack Civil Services Exam.", "language": "en", "text": "There is no alternate to hard work and there are no shortcuts to success. This often repeated advice is seldom followed by the youths. Those who follow it achieve whatever they want in life. They strive for their goals they stick to the basics, that is, hard work and eventually become inspiration for other people. Their life stories match the thrills of fairy tales and their achievements become the leading light for those who want to follow them.\n\nIlma Afroz, daughter of a farmer in Uttar Pradesh has proven that there's always light at the end of the tunnel. Ilma bagged 217th rank in Civil Services Examination 2017 to join the Indian Police Service (IPS).\n\nComing from a farmer's family in a small Kundarki village in Moradabad district of Uttar Pradesh, Ilma's success has been chronicled with stages of struggles. She lost her father when she was just 14-years-old and it was her mother who ensured her children realise their ambitions. Coupled with her mother's struggles and her own grit and determination, Ilma is now able to materialise the dream of serving her country.\n\nFacebook/Ilma Afroz\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Indiatimes, Ilma gave an insight ranging from her upbringing, family and education.\n\nEarly days and \"best decision made\"\n\nIlma was always determined to do good in life. Despite her constraints, she kept studying well and her hard work brought her to the capital where she studied philosophy. \"After my early education from local schools, I applied to St. Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi. The three years I spent reading Philosophy in the college were the best years of my life so far\", she said.\n\nDon't Miss 3.4 K SHARES 580 SHARES 312 SHARES 125 SHARES 158 SHARES\n\n\"Looking back, it was the best decision I ever made (so far). Later, I moved to the University of Oxford for my higher education. I also attended Sciences Po, Paris as an exchange student\", she added.\n\nIs Ammi meant to wait for me all alone in Kundarki village?\n\nShe shared an interesting anecdote of the moment that prompted her to give the civil services exam a shot. \"I was in New York City, and every single day when I came back to my downtown Manhattan room, I yearned for home. For Ammi, and the smile on her face. I would look from the window of my room at New York skyline and then the matchbox like yellow taxis on the road, numerous cars -so ubiquitous of the American dream\", she said.\n\n\"Walking to the office every morning with a coffee cup in my hand just to get a bit of extra heat in New York chill, I would look around and ask myself, is Ammi meant to wait for me all alone in Kundarki? And what about those; the sweat of whose brows paid for my education so far? Will my Oxford education go towards running after the 'foreign dream'? And I decided to come back home and work for realizing our own Indian dream\", she added.\n\nPhilosophy honours - A treasure trove for civil servants\n\nWhen asked about her decision to pursue philosophy at the undergraduate level, Ilma called it as the best decision of her life so far. \"It was the best decision I ever made. I spent three of the most beautiful years of my life so far, studying Philosophy at St. Stephen's College, Delhi University. The tutorial system where a single tutor personally engages with a small group of three or four students is indeed a great strength of the Philosophy programme. Philosoc. meetings held on Friday afternoons were really enriching\", she said.\n\nCalling the course a treasure trove for civil servants, she said, \"I learnt to crystallize an argument, write convincingly and listen patiently. This undergraduate course is a treasure trove for civil servants. I learnt to read, discuss and debate Gandhiji and weigh what impact would a particular decision have in making a change in the life of the last person (antodaya) in the darkest village?\", she said.\n\nFacebook/Ilma Afroz (Sitting 2nd from right)\n\n\"Watan ki mitti\"\n\n\"Watan ki mitti\" is what she says when questioned on the one person she owed her success to. \"I am a farmer's daughter. Mitti, gives me joy. I grew up running on the pagdandi (sidewalks) of the fields with my father. The glistening golden fields feed us. The Khaki again is that of the same colour. And one day we all go back to it. So India and its mitti are my heartbeat\", she said.\n\nAn enviable 217 all-India ranking was no mean feat and Ilma wants the nation to benefit from the knowledge she accumulated. \"The feeling that the benefit of my education and experiences should be reaped by the nation. I must do my bit in living Gandhiji's dream to \"wipe every tear from every eye\", she added.\n\n\"My mother and younger brother sacrificed a lot in giving me a sound education.\"\n\nFacebook/Ilma Afroz\n\nHer message for all!\n\n\"As young Indians, we must work very hard and become a source of joy for the nation. The Preamble to the Constitution of India is a guiding light for all of us. Jai Hind!\"", "description": "The story of Ilma Afroz, who cracked the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) holding 217 all India ranking, highlights that one can crack India\u2019s toughest examination through sheer will and hard work.
