It was the first time the two superstars had gone head-to-head in their careers.\n\nDressel also faced off with Energy Standard captain Chad Le Clos in the 100 butterfly, losing by just 0.01 seconds.\n\nKylie Masse delivers\n\nCanada's Kylie Masse provided yet another standout performance for Cali. The 23-year-old from Lasalle, Ont. won the women's 200 backstroke for the second straight week.\n\nWATCH | Kylie Masse wins 2nd consecutive 200 backstroke:\n\nCanadian Kylie Masse won her 2nd consecutive 200m backstroke race at the International Swimming League stop in Naples, Italy. 2:19\n\nSweden's Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, however, helped keep Energy Standard in the mix. The team's female captain \u2014 and top point-scorer last weekend \u2014 once again won the women's 50 free, but was upset in the 100 fly by Cali's Kelsi Dahlia.\n\nSj\u00f6str\u00f6m, however, made amends in the women's 4\u00d7100 free relay. Together with Canadians Penny Oleksiak and Kyla Sanchez and Femke Heemskerk of the Netherlands, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m swam a critical leg to help Cali take top honours in this event for the second straight week.\n\nWATCH | Penny Oleksiak, Kayla Sanchez swim in the 4x100:\n\nCanadians Penny Oleksiak and Kayla Sanchez, teamed with Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom and Dutch swimmer Femke Heemskerk, won the women's 4x100m freestyle relay at the ISL stop in Naples, Italy. 4:06\n\nThe two teams will battle once again in the skins event on Sunday.\n\nSkins is worth triple the points, and it was a major factor behind Energy Standard's 82-point blowout victory last weekend in Indianapolis.\n\nThe ISL is a set of seven events taking place in the United States and Europe over the next couple of months.\n\nThe league features eight teams \u2014 four based in the United States and four in Europe.\n\nCBC Sports has the Canadian ISL rights and will stream every meet live \u2014 including the the conclusion of the Naples event on Sunday from 1-3 p.m. ET.\n\nStandings after Day 1:", "description": "Caeleb Dressel made all the right waves in his first competition on Saturday, in Naples Italy.", "authors": ["Cbc Sports"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319724.1570923751!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dressel-caeleb-101219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
