(Imagine a life-size swan made from artichoke petals.) A few months later, the brand invited a select group of press, employees, and creative collaborators like filmmakers and photographers on a surreal trip to the Arctic Circle, where they stayed up all night listening to a Lithuanian birdcall musician, as one does. Herm\u00e8s has been doing these trips for the last 32 years, each time with a new theme; 2019 is \u201cHerm\u00e8s Dreams.\u201d\n\nLast week, after the runway shows in New York wrapped, the brand continued this series by commissioning a dance performance at Lincoln Center from the French choreographer Christian Rizzo. It served as an introduction to the Herm\u00e8s Encha\u00eenements libres jewelry collection and was conceptualized by the brand\u2019s creative director of jewelry, Pierre Hardy.\n\nPhoto: Samantha Nandez/BFA.com/Samantha Nandez/BFA.com\n\nThe show began with an elegant pas de deux, the dancers in minimal clothing, no jewelry. Then, performers in black turtlenecks came out wearing the new collection and moved about the space. Under the stage lights, it looked like each shimmering chain was doing its own dance, brought to life against the black of the tops. Finally, the audience was invited to come to the stage to get a closer look. Was it less of an arduous journey than the one to the Arctic Circle? Probably, but just as unexpected.\n\nSee Pieces from the Collection\n\nHerm\u00e8s Grand Jet\u00e9 necklace, with rose gold, diamonds, orange sapphire, black jade, pink opals, grey pearls\n\nHerm\u00e8s Voltige necklace, with yellow gold and diamonds\n\nHerm\u00e8s Grand Jet\u00e9 bracelet, with rose gold, diamonds, orange topaz, black jade, and pink opal\n\nHerm\u00e8s Fusion necklace, with rose gold, titanium, and brown diamonds Photo: Hermes\n\nHermes Chain D\u2019ancre Zoom ring, with rose fold, diamonds, and rock crystal\n\nHermes Adage necklace, with white gold, rose gold, and diamonds", "description": "When Herm\u00e8s hosts an event, guests can expect to be fully transported.
