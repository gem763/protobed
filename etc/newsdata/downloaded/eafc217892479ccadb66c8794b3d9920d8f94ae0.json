No timetable was provided for his return.\n\nThe Pelicans traveled to New York for their matchup against the Knicks, but Williamson didn\u2019t make the trip with the team. The standout forward will remain in New Orleans to undergo additional testing, according to the Pelicans.\n\nWilliamson has made appearances in all four of the Pelicans\u2019 preseason games this year, averaging 23.3 points and 6.5 rebounds in 27.3 minutes per game.\n\nDuring the summer league, Williamson played only eight minutes after he sustained a minor left knee bruise. The team was cautious with the former Duke Blue Devils star and shut him down as a precaution.\n\nWilliamson, who didn\u2019t miss any time during training camp, also suffered a mild right knee sprain while playing for Duke. His Nike sneaker gave out seconds into a game against the North Carolina Tar Heels, causing him to miss six games.\n\nThe Pelicans open their regular-season schedule against the defending NBA champion Toronto Raptors on Oct. 22.", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 New Orleans Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson will be out for the team\u2019s final preseason game against the New York Knicks on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
