The latest AFG data shows loan volumes now approaching a 50-50 split between the major and non-major banks - something unheard of as little as five years ago.\n\nNon-major banks accounted for 45.9 per cent of mortgage written in the September quarter, the highest level since 2007, the figures show.", "description": "First-time property investors are behind the surge in home loan approvals, lured into the market by low interest rates and loosening credit rules particularly from smaller lenders, brokers said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bce8e02b33abbb595c3773fffb7b140bd560fdb7", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
