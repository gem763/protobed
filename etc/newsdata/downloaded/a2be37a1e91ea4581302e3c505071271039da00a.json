Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d There has been unrest and protests in Hong Kong, a \u201cspecial administrative region\u201d of China, since June 9 over an extradition bill that speaks more broadly to how China governs the jurisdiction.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver tried to defend Morey\u2019s right to freedom of speech while simultaneously saying the league was \u201capologetic\u201d for upsetting so many Chinese officials and basketball fans. His approach appeased neither Hong Kong independence activists nor China.\n\nIncome from the NBA\u2019s business dealings in China has a large effect on the league\u2019s basketball-related income, which determines things like players\u2019 salaries.\n\nThe Wizards have hosted the Guangzhou team for exhibitions before, but in the midst of the NBA-China rift, the game became a ripe target for demonstration. Two fans with \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d signs were ejected from a Philadelphia 76ers game Tuesday against the Loong Lions, and while the fans say it was due to their signs, the team released a statement saying it was for \u201ccontinuing disruption of the fan experience.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
