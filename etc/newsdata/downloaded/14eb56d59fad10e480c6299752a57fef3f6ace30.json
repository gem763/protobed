Pilapa\u00f1a admitted to the AP that her family thought she was 'crazy' to take on the venture, but that guinea pig ice cream is now her top seller\n\nGuinea pig is actually a traditional meat dish in some Latin American countries, including Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, where it's called 'cuy.'\n\nIt can be found at many restaurants, including higher-end establishments, and tastes similar to chicken.\n\nIn Ecuador, people typically cook guinea pigs with salt and serve them with potatoes and peanut sauce.\n\nBut Pilapa\u00f1a said that when she had the idea to incorporate it into a frozen dessert, not everyone believed it was a good idea.\n\n'My family and my husband thought I was crazy. They didn't think anyone would like these ice creams, but now they're our main product,' said Pilapa\u00f1a, who attended free training courses for entrepreneurs when she dreamed up the project.\n\nShe was challenged to do something innovative and, after six months of testing, she starting selling her range of ice creams at the beginning of September.\n\nOn the menu: Cuy can be found at many restaurants and tastes similar to chicken. In Ecuador, people typically cook guinea pigs with salt and serve them with potatoes and peanut sauce\n\nIn the kitchen: Pilapa\u00f1a concentrates the guinea pig flavor by cooking and preparing a p\u00e2t\u00e9 from the animal's flesh. She then adds milk or cream and refrigerates the concoction\n\nGrowing popularity: Her shop is just two tables in an open area lined with dentists' clinics and other business, but despite its small, not-so-flashy setup, demand is growing\n\nSomething buzz-worthy: She has other flavors, but her guinea pig ice cream is her most popular product\n\nPilapa\u00f1a concentrates the guinea pig flavor by cooking and preparing a p\u00e2t\u00e9 from the animal's flesh. She then adds milk or cream and refrigerates the concoction until it has the rough consistency of ice cream.\n\nHer shop is just two tables in an open area lined with dentists' clinics and other business, but despite its small, not-so-flashy setup, demand is growing.\n\nEvery week, the entrepreneur prepares 150 servings ($1 for a cone) of guinea pig ice cream.\n\nShe also makes 40 servings of ice cream flavored with beetles, which also traditionally eaten as a salty snack, and a smaller amount of mushroom ice cream.\n\nThe beetle and mushroom ice creams include fruits such as pineapple and passion fruit. Beetle ice cream has a slight aroma of wet earth.\n\nBut the guinea pig ice cream is the most popular, and customers are singing its praises.\n\nServing up smiles: Every week, the entrepreneur prepares 150 servings ($1 for a cone) of guinea pig ice cream\n\nVariety: She also makes 40 servings of ice cream flavored with beetles, which also traditionally eaten as a salty snack, and a smaller amount of mushroom ice cream\n\nWhat's next?

She has new flavors in mind: crab, chicken, and pork.\n\n'Seeing how my business is picking up, I'm sure I'll do well,' she said.\n\nInteresting...
