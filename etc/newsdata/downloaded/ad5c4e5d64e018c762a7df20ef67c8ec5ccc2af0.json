This assumes migration will have a greater impact on the size of the population than the combination of births and deaths.\n\nBy 2043 there will be 72.4 million people in the UK, according to current estimates (Picture: ONS)\n\n\u2018Although migration declines at first and the number of births is stable, the number of deaths is projected to grow as those born in the baby boom after WWII reach older ages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The population is increasingly ageing and this trend will continue. However, because of the expected rise in the State Pension age to 67 years, it is projected that slightly fewer than one in five people will be of pensionable age in 2028, a similar proportion to today.\u2019\n\nThey also predict that the UK population will hit 70 million at some point in mid-2031.\n\nIt is also believed that the proportion of people aged 85 and over will almost double as baby boomers grow older.\n\nLooking at past predictions, growth rate is slower than previously expected and the population is 0.4 million less in mid-2028 and 0.9 million less in mid-2041.", "description": "The UK population is projected to increase by three million over the next decade, from an estimated 66.4 million in mid-2018 to 69.4 million in mid-2028, according to the Office...", "authors": ["Richard Hartley-Parkinson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1077459624-2401_1571649743.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
