Rambling rants about turntables certainly don\u2019t help put such concerns to rest.\n\nBut Biden didn\u2019t stop there. Perhaps he sensed how poorly the answer had gone and was flailing, but he then decided to answer several foreign-policy questions that had been asked of his rivals earlier in the night.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to go like the rest of them do, twice over,\u201d he said when the moderators tried to stop him\u2014the flash of anger a rare break in his unfailing politesse on the debate stage.\n\n\u201cBy the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know [President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro. I\u2019ve confronted Maduro. Number two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America. I\u2019m the guy that came up with $740 million, to see to it those three countries, in fact, changed their system so people don\u2019t have a chance to leave. You\u2019re all acting like we just discovered this yesterday.\u201d\n\nNow Biden wasn\u2019t just rambling\u2014he was the angry old man demanding his rivals, and the moderators, get off his lawn. It was a disastrous answer. Nor was that the only time on Thursday when Biden seemed to be spinning his wheels as he searched for an answer.\n\nBiden faced other tough jabs from his opponents throughout the night. Most pointedly, Juli\u00e1n Castro accused Biden of forgetting a statement about health care. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said, not very subtly broaching the age question. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d\n\n(As New York\u2019s Adam K. Raymond pointed out, though, it was Castro who was mistaken\u2014and Biden who\u2019d been consistent.)\n\nWill any of this matter? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess, but the evidence so far suggests it might not. There\u2019s an active conversation about whether Biden simply isn\u2019t up to the job, especially in the press, but so far his polling has remained remarkably durable. While there\u2019s heavy churn among his rivals, with the field starting to sort out into some clear tiers, Biden has consistently led by a wide margin. Yet he also cannot put the questions to rest, and with every episode like his record scratch giving more ammunition to doubters, the risk is that the accumulation of missteps starts to drag his numbers down.\n\nIf there is one silver lining for Biden, it\u2019s that the misstep came near the end of the debate. Just a few minutes later, he was the first candidate to answer a question about overcoming adversity, and he talked about the death of his wife and daughter in a car crash just after he was elected senator, and the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer in 2015. These are tales that Biden has told before, and he tells them well and movingly.", "description": "Faced with a question on segregation, the vice president skipped a track.", "authors": ["David A.
