PRECIOUS-Gold holds firm as souring trade spat hurts risk appetite\n\n* U.S.-China trade talks set for Oct. 10-11 in Washington\n\n* Signals for gold remain mixed- technicals\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Karthika Suresh Namboothiri\n\nOct 9 (Reuters) - Gold prices on Wednesday held onto the\n\nprevious session's gains, as sagging hopes for progress in\n\nU.S.-China trade negotiations sapped risk appetite, with markets\n\nwatching closely for clues on monetary easing by the U.S.\n\nFederal Reserve.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.1% to $1,506.06 per ounce by 0526\n\nGMT, but stood its ground above $1,500 after jumping as much as\n\n1% in the previous session. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 gained\n\n0.5% to $1,511.60 per ounce.\n\n\"The market is holding back, and looking at what's going to\n\nhappen in the U.S.-China trade talks on Thursday... If the trade\n\ndispute turns worse, we are going to expect some strong risk-off\n\ntrade,\" said Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu.\n\n\"The players who were short, rolled back on their positions.\n\nWe are also seeing some weakness on the equity side.\"\n\nThe United States on Tuesday imposed visa restrictions on\n\nChinese officials for the detention or abuse of Muslim\n\nminorities, angering Beijing ahead of high-level trade talks on\n\nThursday and Friday, and sending Asian stocks lower.\n\nMKTS/GLOB\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs on Chinese\n\nimports will rise on Oct. 15 if no progress is made in the\n\nnegotiations.\n\nAlongside, the U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened in Asia\n\nafter Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signalled further\n\ninterest rate cuts and the resumption of bond purchases to\n\naddress a recent spike in money market rates.\n\nLower interest rates generally lessen the opportunity cost\n\nof holding non-yielding gold and weigh on the dollar.\n\n\"With the latest QE-lite measures, we expect inflow of funds\n\ninto gold-backed ETFs to continue, which is likely to push gold\n\nprices higher. We maintain that gold prices may test as high as\n\n$1,600/oz in this period of uncertainty,\" OCBC Bank said in a\n\nresearch note.\n\nFuelling gold's appeal was also a report that British Prime\n\nMinister Boris Johnson is facing a fresh rebellion in his\n\ncabinet, with a group of ministers poised to resign due to\n\nconcerns that he is leading the country towards a no-deal\n\nBrexit. Signals are mixed for spot gold, as it failed to break a\n\nsupport at $1,488 per ounce, said Reuters market analyst, Wang\n\nTao.\n\nMeanwhile, silver inched 0.3% higher to $17.77 an\n\nounce, while platinum XPT= rose 0.3% to $892.75. Palladium\n\nXPD= declined 0.1% to $1,673.42 an ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold holds firm as souring trade spat hurts risk appetite", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0O0HA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
