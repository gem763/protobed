But are others ready for your ambitious Aries ideas? Don\u2019t rush Rams! Consultation and attention to detail will get you a lot further than being slapdash.\n\nTAURUS April 21-May 21 ***\n\nYou can be incredibly fixed in your opinions and attitudes, which can put others offside. As the weekend progresses, try to get the balance right between being firm and being flexible.\n\nGEMINI May 22-June 21 ***\n\nIf you are disciplined and motivated this weekend, then you\u2019ll power through the to-do list. And you\u2019ll still have plenty of time to help someone who requires your practical assistance.\n\nCANCER June 22-July 23 ***\n\nYou\u2019re keen to move forward but make sure you\u2019ve done all the reality checks \u2013 especially involving relationships. And do your best to balance the budget before you start splashing cash around.\n\nLEO July 24-Aug 23 ***\n\nUranus urges you to move in an exciting new direction.

Change makes us grow.\u201d\n\nVIRGO Aug 24-Sep 23 ***\n\nIf you\u2019re having money problems then think of creative ways to boost income and increase cash flow. When it comes to making a decision about a personal matter, resist the urge to rush.\n\nLIBRA Sep 24-Oct 23 ***\n\nYou can be dazzled by outer beauty but don\u2019t be deceived by glossy outward appearances this weekend. Look beneath the surface to evaluate a person or property\u2019s true lasting value.\n\nSCORPIO Oct 24-Nov 22 ***\n\nThe planets encourage you to make lasting emotional connections within your local area. Friends, neighbours and/or family members will help you to feel an important part of your community.\n\nSAGITTARIUS Nov 23-Dec 21 ***\n\nIf you have a personal problem that needs solving, don\u2019t look for a superficial quick fix. Instead, go deep into the issue to find a satisfactory solution, and realise that you can\u2019t please everyone.\n\nCAPRICORN Dec 22-Jan 20 ***\n\nAvoid being too business-like with others, as it may upset them. Instead, try to balance being professional with the personal touch. Listening closely to what others are really saying is the key.\n\nAQUARIUS Jan 21-Feb 19 ***\n\nThere\u2019s so much to accomplish this weekend so get to it Aquarius! If things have been tense and terse with a loved one, now\u2019s the time to make some serious concessions. Plus be extra patient.\n\nPISCES Feb 20-March 20 **\n\nKeep it real Pisces! If you blur the boundaries between fact and fiction, then it will be a long and confusing weekend. The Capricorn Moon urges you to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground.\n\nYOUR DAY\n\nStrive to be more self-contained, as the Capricorn Moon stymies shows of affection.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nYou are a very sociable soul. December and January are the best months for romance, love, parties, proposals and weddings.\n\nSUNDAY\n\nYOUR DAY\n\nThe Moon pairs up with Pluto, so expect some intense emotional encounters today.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nYou are a fun-loving and optimistic person. 2020 is the year to be more domestically organised and settled.\n\nCopyright Joanne Madeline Moore 2019", "description": "See what the weekend stars have in store for you.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5969/7663b593413742b7934c2066c7fb0e76.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
