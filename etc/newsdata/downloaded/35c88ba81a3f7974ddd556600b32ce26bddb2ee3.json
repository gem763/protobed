Bush at a Dallas Cowboys football game. \"I'm friends with George Bush,\" she said. \"In fact, I'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs that I have.\" https://t.co/UJkBtBFJ5U pic.twitter.com/rpgVjlkVww \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 8, 2019\n\nEllen DeGeneres found herself in a bit of hot water when she recently deigned to be photographed sitting next to George and Laura Bush and *gasp* enjoying herself.\n\nEllen is being hailed for her \u201copen-minded\u201d plea for civility, as if the rest of us haven\u2019t been living our lives like this every single day. I live in California. My friend pointed out that Ellen\u2019s \u201crevelation\u201d is just everyday life for those of us here who don\u2019t identify as rabidly progressive.\n\nI live in CA. I have to get along and be pleasant with people I am diametrically opposed to all day.\n\nBut Ellen and George. \ud83d\ude10 \u2014 shelli (@shelli_eaton) October 8, 2019\n\nI\u2019m black, and I work in and around the entertainment business. Every day, everywhere I go people freely and gleefully throw their progressive politics at me. They\u2019re not lecturing. They\u2019re just\u2026assuming. They\u2019re looking at my skin and assuming I\u2019m a liberal, assuming I need a safe space from Big Orange Bad Man, assuming I agree with their every liberal notion on everything from homelessness to public education. They unflinchingly disparage people who didn\u2019t vote for who they think we all should have voted for. They insult flyover country conservatives, Trump supporters, or just anyone who doesn\u2019t loudly and proudly toe the far-left progressive line.\n\nNo progressive ever asks me my opinion. They just\u2026assume. They assume I hate everyone who isn\u2019t like me the way they hate everyone who isn\u2019t like them. It\u2019s liberal privilege, a narcissism of a sort. They sail through life thinking everyone is just like them, never thinking anything else. Thus, they have the privilege to say whatever to whomever and wherever they like.\n\nAnd yet, Californians like me don\u2019t need to make public pleas to just \u201clove everyone\u201d. We are forced to live that out every day of our lives. We navigate a landscape that isn\u2019t just politically unfriendly, but starting to become downright dangerous. What Ellen experienced is a very small representation of life in this state as a non-progressive. You don\u2019t even have to be a conservative\u2026just being someone who doesn\u2019t think Donald Trump is going to set the whole world on fire tomorrow is enough to raise the ire of too many people around these parts.\n\nWe don\u2019t pat each other on the back. We don\u2019t need to defend ourselves to each other for working and socializing with left-wing progressives. That\u2019s because we already know what Ellen is just now expressing publicly \u2013 that you can actually live quite peacefully and joyfully next to people with whom you have fundamental political differences. You can disagree on very deep issues without labeling the other person as evil and irredeemable. You enjoy the company of people who vote differently from you (and even who offend you in some ways) and then go home and mind your own business.\n\nEvery single interaction with someone on the other side of the political aisle from you does not need to become a PRINCIPLED STAND. Ma\u2019am, this is a Wendy\u2019s. Just take your chocolate Frosty and exit the line.\n\nI\u2019m glad Ellen said what she said and more progressive celebrities need to stand up with her and echo the sentiment. This is not a column trashing Ellen. I\u2019m a fan, always have been, always will be. What she said was right, but it was also something a lot of other people have been saying for a long time but are being ignored and shouted down because they\u2019re LITERALLY HITLER\u2122 or something.\n\nFor the internet mafia that tried to come for Ellen, this may look like a missed opportunity to stand up for *insert self-righteous cause here* to the elderly, amateur painter, former leader of the free world. They fail to extend the picture to what happened directly after the game, which is this \u2013 Ellen and Portia went home. George and Laura went home. Everyone went about their business and enjoyed their life. The end.\n\nWe are not such a helpless citizenry that our only options for \u201cjustice\u201d are to indignantly and aggressively confront every public figure we disagree with. You don\u2019t need to throw a glass of water in Tomi Lahren\u2019s face while she\u2019s out quietly enjoying brunch with her family. You can beat Tomi at the ballot box. You can thwart the Bush\u2019s on the campaign trail. You can participate in the messy, non-violent revolution that happens in this country every four years. If you make your case to the electorate well enough, you\u2019ll win.\n\nIn fact, if you\u2019re a liberal just know that you will have a win some day soon enough. For no other reason than American politics is cyclical. That is the joy and the pain of our republic.\n\nUntil then, perhaps you can stand down from your hatred for a few minutes and recognize that you come across people who are fundamentally opposed to your politics every damn day. At the grocery store, school, work\u2026where ever. You just don\u2019t know it because they don\u2019t wear their politics on their sleeves. You\u2019ve touched them, talked to them, maybe even shared a laugh with them and somehow the world continued to spin on its axis.", "description": "Ellen Degeneres\u2019 Plea for Civility Is the Daily Reality of Non-Progressives Like Me", "authors": ["Kira Davis", "Brandon Morse", "Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Seton Motley", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media.townhall-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
