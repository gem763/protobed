AFP/Getty Images\n\nJudge Peter Lodder QC found the stabbing had a \u201cterrorist connection\u201d on Tuesday and jailed Fuller for 18 years and nine months.\n\n\u201cThis was an act of attempted murder and, as I have found, this was a terrorist act,\u201d he told the court, after finding the stabbing was motivated by white supremacy and anti-Muslim hatred.\n\n\"It was your stated intention to kill a Muslim, which you attempted to do in that stabbing.\n\n\"I find that it was your purpose to strike fear into the heart of people you described as non-English, in particular Muslims.\"\n\nThe attack unfolded on 16 March, the day after 51 Muslims were massacred at mosques in Christchurch.\n\n\u201cVincent got a bit angry about the news from New Zealand because he said, \u2018it is always them, the Muslims that get looked after and get cared about\u2019,\u201d his girlfriend told police.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Kill all the non-English and get them all out of England.\u201dA second post published half an hour later afterwards added: \u201cI agree with what that man did in New Zealand as we will not be brainwashed to this their wrong [sic].\u201d\n\nProsecutors said he first attacked a neighbour\u2019s home with a baseball bat, calling the woman of Indian descent a \u201cblack c***\u201d.\n\nNeighbours heard Fuller shouting \u201ckill Muslims\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d, with one woman reporting he said: \u201cAll Muslims should die, white supremacists rule. I\u2019m going to murder a Muslim.\u201d\n\nAfter the woman refused to answer her door, Fuller walked down the road attacking cars and shouting racist insults and threats at drivers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to f***ing kill you, I\u2019m going to f***ing cut your throat you black bastard,\u201d he shouted at one driver, before attacking an Uber driven by a Muslim man.\n\nFuller broke the bat after attacking several vehicles, then went back home and armed himself with a knife.\n\nHe walked towards a Tesco supermarket, where a 19-year-old Bulgarian man was in his car talking to friends.\n\nWitnesses said they saw Fuller approaching with a 12in knife with a black blade before he asked the teenagers: \u201cDo you want to get hurt?\u201d\n\nThe court heard that the victim replied \u201cwhat?\u201d before Fuller told him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to die.\u201d\n\nThe driver attempted to start his car to escape but Fuller lunged through the open window and stabbed him in the hand and neck.\n\nHe managed to drive to a nearby McDonald\u2019s and received first aid, before undergoing three hours of surgery.\n\nProsecutor Jonathan Polnay said the teenager was targeted because he has lightly-tanned skin and was sat next to a friend with a long beard.\n\n\u201cHis conduct was motivated by racist and religious hatred, bolstered by the consumption of alcohol,\u201d he told the court.\n\n\u201dHis intention was to strike fear into the hearts of people he described as 'non-English', in particular Muslims.\u201d\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Kath Barnes, the head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, described Fuller as an \u201cangry and dangerous individual\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is fortunate that the victim was able to defend himself despite being confined to his car, as otherwise this would undoubtedly have been a murder investigation,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to tackling all forms of toxic extremist ideology, which has the potential to threaten public safety and security.\"\n\nFuller, of Viola Avenue in Stanwell, was arrested a short distance away after being Tasered by police and initially denied carrying out the attack.\n\nHe later admitted attempted murder, possession of a bladed article, affray and racially aggravated harassment, alarm or distress.\n\nProsecutors said he called police officers \u201cdirty immigrant scum\u201d while being arrested, adding: \u201cDirty race traitor, I hope your kids die. I hope your f***ing family die.\u201d\n\nFuller added: \u201cI hope Syrians come over and rape your children. I hope Isis comes over and rapes your children.\u201d\n\nThe court heard that he bore animosity towards police over an investigation of allegations made by his ex-girlfriend.\n\nThe day before the attack, Fuller rejected a request to attend a voluntary interview over threatening Facebook messages, calling the officer a \u201clittle girl\u201d and telling her to \u201cf*** off\u201d.\n\nA friend who spent time with him on the morning of the attack said he was \u201cpreoccupied with the fact that the police wanted to speak to him\u201d, and saw television news about the Christchurch attack shortly afterwards.\n\nIn a police interview, Fuller admitted watching the shooter\u2019s video and writing the Facebook posts, but \u201csaid he was angry and did not mean it\u201d.\n\nHe tested positive for cannabis and alcohol, and told police he had downed a large bottle of cider and three cans of strong lager.\n\nFuller has 24 previous convictions for 59 offences, including a six-year prison sentence in 1998 for stealing handbags from elderly women.\n\nBenjamin Waidhofer, defending, told the court on Friday that his client had no historic links to terrorism and his actions stemmed from family problems \u201crather than an attempt to further a cause\u201d.\n\nBut prosecutor Jonathan Polnay said that if someone had praised the London Bridge terror attacks, said they were going to kill non-Muslims and then stabbed someone, then that would \u201cobviously be terrorism\u201d.\n\nThe Stanwell incident is one of several alleged terror attacks and plots inspired by the Christchurch shooting, which saw the perpetrator publish a lengthy manifesto detailing a theory that white people are being \u201creplaced\u201d by Muslims.\n\nBrenton Tarrant has been described as a \u201csaint\u201d on extremist forums and cited as an inspiration by white supremacists who carried out shooting massacres in El Paso and Poway.\n\nOn Monday, the head of UK counter-terror policing revealed that security services had foiled 15 Islamist and seven far-right attacks since March 2017.\n\n\"There remains the concern of returning foreign fighters, lone actors, mental illness, and the rising threat of right-wing terrorism,\" assistant commissioner Neil Basu said. \"Once a local threat, it is now a global phenomenon as adept at using social media as Daesh.\"", "description": "A far-right terrorist who tried to kill Muslims in a rampage the day after the Christchurch attack has been jailed for more than 18 years.
