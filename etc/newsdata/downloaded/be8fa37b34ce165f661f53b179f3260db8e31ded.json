(Photo: Facebook)\n\nA woman in New Hampshire claims that her daughter's eighth-grade teacher threatened her and then cut her hair. Now, the mom is asking school officials to act after the teacher was allegedly suspended for only three days while an internal investigation occurred.\n\nJillian Miglionico told WMUR that while her daughter was in class at Somersworth Middle School, the teacher told her daughter to stop playing with her hair. When she did not stop, the teacher allegedly threatened to cut it off.\n\n\"He threatened her and said, 'Well, if you don\u2019t stop playing with your hair, I\u2019m going to cut your hair off.' And she was like, 'No, you can't do that.' He said, 'Oh yeah? Watch me,'\u201d Miglionico told the news outlet. According to the mother, the teacher then took a pair of scissors and cut off a three-inch chunk of the student\u2019s hair.\n\nMiglionico's daughter, who she says was scared and embarrassed, did not report the incident. However, a teacher's aide at the school came forward. The aide informed the principal, who then called Miglionico to let her know what had happened, reported WISTV.\n\nBut on Monday, Miglionico was shocked to learn that the teacher had already returned to the classroom and that her daughter is still his student.\n\n\u201cHe missed, I think, three days of school while the internal investigation happened and now he\u2019s back in school and they put her right back in his classroom... It\u2019s basically a total disregard to her,\u201d Miglionico said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this man around my child,\u201d Miglioncio said, adding that she wants the teacher removed.\n\nSuperintendent of School Administrative Unit 56, Robert Gadomski, informed WMUR that his office is conducting an investigation and that he could not comment further as the incident involved a minor.\n\nGadomski and Miglionico did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A mother claims that an eighth-grade teacher threatened and cut her daughter's hair, and that he was allegedly suspended for only three days while the school performed an internal investigation.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o8j6.OjVVIN8Uq7_wGAvpw--~B/aD05MDg7dz0xNDg4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/6083e810-df17-11e9-b3f8-415022f6dbc8", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
