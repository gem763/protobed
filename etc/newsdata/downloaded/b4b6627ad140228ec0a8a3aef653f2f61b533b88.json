VIDEO The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China continues to weigh on global growth and financial markets, and businesses have reported they are delaying planned investments as a result of rising policy uncertainty. One worry is that this chill over investments eventually could prompt businesses to pull back on hiring or lay off workers. The Labor Department is set to report Friday morning on U.S. hiring and unemployment in August. More on the Fed Fed Lines Up Another Quarter-Point Rate Cut So far, economic data suggest weakness in the manufacturing sector hasn\u2019t spilled over to the much broader services sector. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic output, has kept the economy growing at a steady annual rate of more than 2% this year. Some Fed officials have suggested that greater uncertainty should make them less forthcoming about their policy plans, because of the difficulty forecasting the economic outlook. In a speech last month, Mr. Powell didn\u2019t push back against market expectations of a rate cut this month and left an open door to provide more stimulus after that. He also gave his most forceful warning to date about the risks to the U.S. economy from escalating trade tensions and the limits of the central bank\u2019s tools to cushion potential disruptions. There are \u201cno recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation,\u201d Mr. Powell said at the Kansas City Fed\u2019s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. \u201cMonetary policy is a powerful tool,\u201d but \u201cit cannot provide a settled rule book for international trade,\u201d he said. Mr. Powell has faced unusual and persistent criticism from President Trump for not moving more aggressively to cut interest rates. Immediately after Mr. Powell\u2019s speech last month, Mr. Trump called Mr. Powell an \u201cenemy\u201d for not promising to provide more stimulus. Mr. Powell has taken pains to avoid escalating any conflict with Mr. Trump and to assure the public that the Fed doesn\u2019t take partisan politics into account when setting policy.
