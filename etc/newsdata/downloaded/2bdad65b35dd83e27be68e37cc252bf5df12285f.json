But I find it beyond ironic that a staunchly liberal seminary which supports a woman\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to abortion held a special chapel service to confess to plants. So, it\u2019s fine to take the lives of unborn babies in the womb, but we must confess our sins to the plants. May God help us.\n\nOn September 17, Union Theological Seminary tweeted, \u201cToday in chapel, we confessed to plants. Together, we held our grief, joy, regret, hope, guilt and sorrow in prayer; offering them to the beings who sustain us but whose gift we too often fail to honor.\n\n\u201cWhat do you confess to the plants in your life?\u201d\n\nWhat, exactly, did these confessions sound like?\n\nOne seminarian tweeted, \u201cHere was my confession. \u2018I confess that even as I\u2019ve waxed poetic and theological about how indispensable you are, I\u2019ve privileged my own comfort and convenience over your wellbeing.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s not just a matter of white privilege. It\u2019s now a matter of human privilege. How unkind we have been to the plants!\n\nIn sarcastic response to the chapel service, singer and songwriter Bob Bennett penned a penitent hymn, beginning with,\n\nI confess my unbelief\n\nTo my leafy brethren\n\nI\u2019ve given you such grief\n\nWhile you give me oxygen\n\nLike a prodigal come home\n\nAn errant journey I was on\n\nNow no more to roam\n\nI\u2019ll no longer mow my lawn.\n\nBut the seminary was taking this quite seriously, releasing a series of 10 tweets defending their plant confessional.\n\nThe first tweet stated, \u201cWe've had many questions about yesterday's chapel, conducted as part of @ccarvalhaes' class, \u2018Extractivism: A Ritual/Liturgical Response.\u2019 In worship, our community confessed the harm we've done to plants, speaking directly in repentance.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful ritual.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, although I\u2019ve served as a visiting or adjunct professor at 7 leading seminaries, I don\u2019t recall ever hearing of a class on \u201cExtractivism: A Ritual/Liturgical Response.\u201d\n\nIn fact, I don\u2019t recall encountering the word \u201cextractivism\u201d before. (It looks like my spell checker never saw it either.) I guess I\u2019m still in the theological dark ages. Really, a pity.\n\nOthers, however, chimed in their support of Union, including Kaitlyn Curtice, a Native American Christian author. She tweeted: \u201cChristians have historically mocked/punished Indigenous peoples for having a relationship to Segmekwe, Mother Earth, and our creature kin.\n\n\u201cIt hasn't changed much.\n\n\u201cI'm grateful to @UnionSeminary for stepping into this space.\n\n\u201cChurch, there is so much learning & unlearning to do.\u201d\n\nWell, here\u2019s the thing.\n\nI\u2019m all for caring for our plants and wildlife. And I\u2019m all for responsible environmentalism. But I\u2019m not going to pray to Mother Earth. And I\u2019m not going to confess to plants. Nor will I look to plants as \u201cthe beings who sustain us.\u201d\n\nThere is one Being who sustains us (and the plants), and I will make my confession to Him.\n\nBut the purpose of this article is not primarily to mock what took place in this chapel service. Instead, it is to point out the theological (and moral) bankruptcy of a seminary once it throws out the full inspiration of Scripture and denies the uniqueness of Jesus\u2019 work of redemption.\n\nAccordingly, a seminary spokesperson explained that, at their chapel services, you might encounter a Muslim prayer service one day, a traditional Anglican service another day, then a Buddhist meditation the next. Yes, \u201cgiven the incredible diversity of our community, that means worship looks different every day!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, back in 1939, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who attended Union and then briefly taught there, could note that, the students \u201care completely clueless with respect to what dogmatics is really about. They are not familiar with even the most basic questions. They become intoxicated with liberal and humanistic phrases, are amused at the fundamentalists, and yet basically are not even up to their level.\u201d\n\nAnd that was 1939!\n\nBonhoeffer remembered that \u201cstudents \u2018openly [laughed]\u2019 at a lecture on sin and forgiveness, and accused the seminary of having \u2018forgotten what Christian theology in its very essence stands for.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat would Bonhoeffer think today?\n\nNot surprisingly, and in keeping with the radical left ideology that esteems the life of a tree above the life of an unborn baby, Union Seminary tweeted this message on July 1: \u201c\u2018In Numbers 5 you actually have an account about how a priest is supposed to assist an abortion...In Jesus\u2019 time, women used all sorts of means\u2014as they have throughout history\u2014to deal with unwanted pregnancies.\u2019 - @SereneJones on abortion and the Bible.\u201d\n\nEmbedded in the tweet was a Fox News video clip which cited Madonna as saying that Jesus would be OK with abortion. And the clip featured a debate between Pastor Shane Idleman and Dr. Serene Jones, President of the Union Theological Seminary.\n\nIn the video, Dr. Jones affirms Madonna\u2019s position (also pointing to her as a very religious person) before absolutely butchering the Bible (yes, \u201cbutchering\u201d is not an overstatement). And Dr. Jones is the president of a seminary?\n\nAccording to Dr. Jones, Numbers 5, contains an account of \u201chow a priest is to assist the abortion of a woman seeking an abortion,\u201d claiming that in the passage you have \u201cpositive affirmation\u201d of abortion.\n\nThis is absolute, total and complete rubbish. Rubbish! Numbers 5 says nothing of the kind.\n\nAnd rather than being a positive affirmation of abortion, the text is a ritual of judgment for a woman suspected of adultery whereby the priest pronounces a curse over her.\n\nThe woman, if guilty of adultery, is cursed, not helped. And whatever happens to her body is negative and disfiguring, not positive and affirming. (And in reality, Numbers 5 has nothing to do with abortion at all. See here.)\n\nBut this is exactly of what you can expect from a seminary that long ago abandoned the truth.\n\nConfession is made to plants while the slaughtering of the unborn is affirmed.\n\nAs I said before, may God help us.", "description": "I\u2019m all for environmental stewardship, and there\u2019s something to be .09/22/2019 1:10:54AM EST.", "authors": ["Michael Brown", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/219/9773242b-193f-450f-9983-a158196d0181.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
