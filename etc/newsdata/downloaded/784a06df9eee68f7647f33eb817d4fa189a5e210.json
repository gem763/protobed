The liberal talk show host made it clear long ago that he\u2019s no supporter of President Trump. He spent most of the interview joking around with the Democratic presidential hopeful, asking softball questions.\n\nBut then he asked a serious question about the cost of her proposed \u201cMedicare For All\u201d scheme.\n\n\u201cHow are you going to pay for it? Are you going to be raising middle-class taxes?\u201d Colbert asked.\n\nNow she could have done what a normal person would do: answer the question. But she\u2019s not a normal person, she\u2019s a politician. So she decided to dodge the question.\n\n\u201cSo, here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do this,\u201d she started. \u201cCosts are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations\u2026 and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down.\u201d\n\nColbert kept pressing her on the issue to no success. She refused to answer the question.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Warren\u2019s skirted the issue. During the ABC debate last week she dodged the same question, twice in a row.\n\nThis raises an important question: why can\u2019t she answer such a simple question? If she really believes a government takeover of healthcare will cause overall costs to go down why doesn't she just admit taxes would be raised?\n\nThe answer is obvious: she knows voters do not take kindly to tax increases. Bernie Sanders, the guy who \u201cwrote the damn bill\u201d isn\u2019t so squeamish. He admitted in July that tax increases for Medicare-For-All could go as high as $10,000 per household.\n\nNot just for the \u201cmillionaires and billionaires.\u201d For middle-class families.\n\nWarren has already come out in favor of taxes that hurt the middle class. Her carbon tax would drastically increase utility bills, making it harder for families to keep the lights on. Not to mention the massive price increase Americans will face at the pump.\n\nAnd if you want to defend your family, Warren\u2019s national gun tax of 30% will make it much harder. Many low-income families won't be able to afford firearms at all, leaving them defenseless.\n\nEven Vox, one of America\u2019s most liberal publications, admits that progressive policies are impossible to fund without taxing the middle class. At a cost of over $32 trillion per decade, none of the current tax proposals levied by Warren would be enough to pay for it. According to the Tax Foundation, even raising the top marginal tax rate to 70% would only raise $ 700 billion in 10 years.\n\nSo Bernie is correct. Paying for Medicare-For-All means taxing the middle class more.\n\nWarren talks about fighting back against \u201cflat wages and exploding household costs.\u201d First, this is completely false. Wages have been climbing under the Trump administration thanks to deregulation and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nImposing new taxes on middle class families will not reduce household costs. And raising taxes on the \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d certainly won\u2019t raise wages.\n\nProgressives proclaim their policies are by the people and for the people. But if they lie about the simplest facts why should we trust them on anything? Or give them the keys to the White House?\n\nGrover Norquist said it best: \u201cIf Elizabeth Warren will not admit the obvious\u2014that her wild spending will require broad-based tax hikes on the middle class\u2014in a Democrat debate, will she ever tell the truth in a general election?\u201d\n\nBetter yet, will she ever tell the truth at all?", "description": "Last week, Elizabeth Warren walked into an interview that was .09/23/2019 0:25:41AM EST.", "authors": ["Emmanuel Sessegnon", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/60b00bc8-ee23-4c64-9e7b-8cc70bdd0576.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
