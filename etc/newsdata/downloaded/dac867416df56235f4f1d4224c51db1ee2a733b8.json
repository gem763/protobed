They are not brash or ahead of themselves but Warren Gatland\u2019s players have complete faith in their ability.\n\nWilliams summed up that self-assurance in Beppu on Tuesday. \u201cThere is only one thing we think we can do and that is to win it,\u201d the Wales full-back said of their World Cup chances. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve got the easy route but we\u2019ve got France next and we need to beat them to be looking at the bigger picture. I think we can go on and win it.\u201d\n\nJosh Adams has Wales quarter-final and World Cup record in his sights Read more\n\nWales, who beat France on the way to the Six Nations Grand Slam this year, won all of their Pool D fixtures \u2013 Georgia, Australia, Fiji and Uruguay \u2013 to set up a last-eight tie in Oita. Their captain, Alun Wyn Jones, has already told his team they are only three games away from doing something special and for which they would be remembered for ever.\n\nWilliams, too, is on the verge of his own place in rugby history. No player has won the English Premiership, European Cup, Six Nations and World Cup in the same season but the 28-year-old is getting close to what would be a remarkable achievement. He sealed a domestic and European double with Saracens this year and starred for Wales in the Six Nations before travelling to Japan.\n\nWales will look to continue a run over France that has seen them lose only once to them since they were defeated 9-8 in the 2011 World Cup semi-final. \u201cOver the past 18 months we\u2019ve won the Six Nations and had a lot of success. It has been great for Wales and hopefully it is going to put us in really good stead,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe have been happy with four wins from four here but it doesn\u2019t mean anything unless we beat France.\n\n\u201cWe have beaten them seven of the last eight times but this is the biggest one. They have been playing well in this World Cup. It is going to be a tough game.\u201d\n\nWilliams used to struggle with a stammer that inhibited his ability to give interviews but it has improved to the extent he cracked jokes as he cut a relaxed figure. He has grown both on and off the field into one of rugby\u2019s best players and has been in fine form in Japan, with tries against Georgia and Fiji.\n\n\u201cI love Japan and I love the people,\u201d Williams said, before adding with a laugh. \u201cI love the naked spas \u2013 they are really good with the boys.\u201d But on a more serious note, he reflected on the change since he moved to England to join Saracens. \u201cI was with the Scarlets for six years and leaving Wales to go and play in London has been great. That has taught me a lot about myself on and off the pitch. Maybe I\u2019ve matured a bit.\u201d\n\nDan Biggar, Jonathan Davies and George North all returned to full training on Tuesday. Six players sat out the session \u2013 including Hadleigh Parkes, Gareth Davies and Josh Adams \u2013 but only to rest bumps and bruises.\n\nFrance will go into the quarter-final somewhat rusty having not played for two weeks. Their final Pool C meeting with England was cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. They are also concerned about the fitness of the scrum-half Antoine Dupont, who is struggling with a back problem.\n\nThe France No 8, Louis Picamoles, said: \u201cWales are a team we know well. It\u2019s always a special match. We haven\u2019t beaten them very often, but we\u2019ve never been far off either. \u201cWe want to play a good match on Sunday so we can start to dream.\u201d", "description": "Liam Williams said Wales can go on to win the World Cup but was not underestimating France", "authors": ["Alex Bywater"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d323ba3185e9a40d7375f1e7a570efa4de29ac6a/149_331_7903_4741/master/7903.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=129cbe3acee6ccc6f19a8bf11e922797", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
