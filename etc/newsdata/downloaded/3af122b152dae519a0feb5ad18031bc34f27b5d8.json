And to my mind, he went off to a happy ending,\" Gilligan said. \"But as the years progressed, I thought, 'What did that ending \u2014 let's just call it an ending, neither happy, nor sad \u2014 what did it look like?'\"\n\nFor his part, Paul said he was good after the finale aired.\n\n\"I really loved Jesse,\" the actor said. \"I knew him better than anyone, but it was a big weight off of my shoulders to hang up the cleats and walk away. I thought it was goodbye, and I was OK with that.\"\n\nLike many others Paul thought the ending of the series was perfect, so \"why mess with that?\"\n\nBut his loyalty to Gilligan (\"I would follow Vince into a fire\") helped draw him back Paul told the publication.\n\n\"It was so easy for me to just jump into where Jesse's at mentally, emotionally, because I lived and breathed everything he went through and then some, and so, honestly, it felt like a part of me had gone through that as well,\" Paul said. \"All I had to do was just memorize these words and then play them out when they yelled 'action.' \"\n\nGilligan has a warning for newbie's to the show,: \"If, after 12 years, you haven't watched 'Breaking Bad,' you're probably not going to start now.\"\n\n\"If you do, I hope that this movie would still be engaging on some level, but there's no doubt in my mind that you won't get as much enjoyment out of it,\" he said.\n\n\"We don't slow down to explain things to a non-'Breaking Bad' audience. I thought early on in the writing of the script, 'Maybe there's a way to have my cake and eat it too. Maybe there's a way to explain things to the audience.' If there was a way to do that, it eluded me.\"", "description": "\"What happened to Jesse?\"", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131216153907-02-year-in-entertainment-story-top.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
