KCNA via REUTERS\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump are expected to hold a summit at the United Nations this month, Moon\u2019s office said on Friday, amid hopes for a restart of talks aimed at dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\nSeoul and Washington are working to fix a date for the meeting during Moon\u2019s trip to New York for the U.N. General Assembly from Sept. 22-26, Moon\u2019s spokeswoman Ko Min-jung told a briefing.\n\nThe announcement came days after North Korea said it was willing to reopen denuclearisation talks with the United States within the month.\n\nThe negotiations stalled after a failed summit in February between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but the two agreed to revive talks when they met in June at the inter-Korean border.\n\nTrump said on Thursday he would be willing to have another meeting with Kim at some point later this year which would be their fourth since an unprecedented summit in June 2018.\n\nTrump\u2019s removal of John Bolton, his hard-line national security adviser, earlier this week could facilitate the revival of the talks though it will hardly make the U.S. goal of persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons any easier, analysts say.\n\nPyongyang has also repeatedly called for U.S. concessions on sanctions, warning that dealings between both sides could end unless Washington takes a fresh approach.", "description": "South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump are expected to hold a summit at the United Nations this month, Moon's office said on Friday, amid hopes for a restart of talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons program.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429292691&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C070-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
