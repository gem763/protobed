We\u2019re not afraid to make bold statements & exercise our first amendment rights.\u201d\n\nAdAge reported on the Times Square \u201cLady Liberty\u201d purchase on Thursday, which includes \u201cmiddle school teacher and Marine Corps veteran Michal Mesa\u201d looming over Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] inspired by the superhero Wonder Woman and her Lasso of Truth,\u201d Ad Age reported.\n\nAnother image on Dhvani\u2019s Twitter feed feature Mr. Trump surrounded by five women while one of his captors holds duct tape in front of his mouth.\n\n\u201cLady Liberty\u201d is a metaphor.\n\n\n\nWe are 100% against violence.\n\nWe support Justice & The Rule of Law.\n\nWe stand with more than half of our nation in support of Impeachment. pic.twitter.com/BBrRdMQ6w4 \u2014 DHVANI (@DhvaniWear) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cFor nearly three long & tiring years, our American patriotism has been exploited,\u201d the company tweeted Tuesday. \u201cWe were told President Trump that he would \u2018make America great again.\u2019 Instead, we have a nation more divided than ever before & further away from the ideals that make America truly \u2018great.\u2019 \u2026 Enough is enough. We\u2019re taking a stand. We\u2019re standing up for a woman\u2019s right to choose, which is the law of the land. We\u2019re standing up for women and LGBTQ+ rights. We\u2019re standing up for the un- & under-insured\u2019s ability to access affordable reproductive care.\u201d\n\nChloe Mason, Dhvani chief communications officer and the lead model in the campaign, told Curve Magazine that Planned Parenthood had a role in bringing the campaign to life.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to join Planned Parenthood in defending women from assaults on our reproductive rights,\u201d Ms. Mason said Tuesday. \u201cTrump administration policies are threatening the health and bodily autonomy of women, especially women of color, low-income women, and LGBTQ women.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Planned Parenthood released a statement on Friday denying involvement in the campaign.\n\nMelanie Newman, SVP of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, wrote the following: \u201cPlanned Parenthood does not endorse this campaign, nor will we be accepting funds raised by this campaign. Our staff members have faced threats and acts of violence for doing their jobs, and many of our patients turn to us as their safe space for care after facing violence in their lives. We do not condone violence or violent imagery against anyone.\u201d\n\nThis is not OK.\n\n\n\nAttacking Gold Star families is not OK.\n\n\n\nMocking a disabled American on national TV is not OK.\n\n\n\nReferring to America\u2019s allies as \u201cshithole countries\u201d is not OK.\n\n\n\nCalling white supremacists \u201cvery fine people\u201d is not OK. pic.twitter.com/fheP8FctM1 \u2014 DHVANI (@DhvaniWear) October 15, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
