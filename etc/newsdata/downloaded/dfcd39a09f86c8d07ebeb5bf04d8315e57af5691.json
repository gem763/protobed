(Photo: Stephanie Gonot)\n\nComedian and actress Ali Wong's first book, \"Dear Girls,\" is everything her fans would expect: raunchy, real and uproariously funny.\n\nFramed as a collection of letters to her daughters, the memoir details Wong\u2019s rebellious youth, sexual exploits and life as a wife and mother. It\u2019s out Tuesday.\n\nAt times, Wong, 37, is definitively R-rated. Expect details on pre- and post-coital routines, smoking weed and ayahuasca ceremonies.\n\nThen, she\u2019s vulnerable. She talks about the struggle of being the \u201caccident\u201d sibling and not relating to her mother growing up. And, later in life, fighting to find success in comedy as a woman and an Asian.\n\nThrough it all, she\u2019s the best kind of funny.\n\nWong spoke with USA TODAY about family, learning from failure and how she measures success (hint: she can afford Whole Foods mango now but continues to be friends with a woman she hates so she can get free lemons off her tree).\n\nEdited for length and clarity.\n\nQuestion: Why did you frame your book as letters to your daughters?\n\nAnswer: I talked in the book about a letter I got from my dad before he passed away and how it was so meaningful, but at the same time, I wish he had written more. If I did do it over, I would have interviewed him while he was sick about who he was before he became a father, his upbringing and his childhood. First and foremost, I was inspired by that.\n\n(I have) all these letters that I wanted to write to my kids, and I was like, \u201cOh, I might as well make money off of it.\u201d (Laughs)\n\nMore: Adam Rippon spills on Sean Spicer, Mike Pence and 'The Masked Singer' before memoir\n\nQ: How was writing a book different than stand-up?\n\nA:It was so scary to write this book. I think I\u2019m a person who has good taste. I like Ta-Nehisi (Coates) and Zadie Smith and \u201cHomegoing\u201d (by Yaa Gyasi). I like all these great writers. Once I started writing, I was like, \"How come I don\u2019t sound like them?\" I think I was focusing too much on what I wanted to sound like versus what I wanted to say. In terms of instinct and what would drive the most inspiration, it\u2019s my kids and what I want to say to them.\n\nQ: In the book, you talk about a \u201cgift\u201d your husband gave you, when he made you write down your goals. Is there anything on that list you still want to accomplish?\n\nA:I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m trying to get really good at being satisfied and grateful for the things that I have. I think the reason why that song (\u201cSatisfied\u201d) in \u201cHamilton\u201d is so great \u2026 is because (people) are never satisfied with what they have. While that can be very motivating, I think it can also be unhealthy and produce a lot of anxiety. The self-help part of me is trying to be very grateful and satisfied with what I have.\n\nQ: You don\u2019t want to be in \u201cThe Room Where It Happens\u201d?\n\nA:(Laughs) No, in all honesty and truth, there\u2019s nothing on there. I used to want to have four kids. I used to want that very badly. As you know, even going from one to two (kids) is really intense. Things change once you have kids. I don\u2019t know if I can handle two.\n\n\u201cDear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets, and Advice for Living Your Best Life,\u201d by Ali Wong. (Photo: Random House)\n\nQ: In your stand-up special \"Baby Cobra,\" you said you'd consider your life a success when you could afford Whole Foods mango. How do you measure success now?\n\nA:Today, for example, I was able to go hiking in the middle of the day with my husband. That, to me, is a big signifier of success. Oh! And then what was crazy, was that it\u2019s this hike we do where we never used to pay for parking. We would always park blocks away from the start of the trail to save money. And now we\u2019re like, \u201cOK, I think we deserve to park near the head of the trail.\u201d It was like $10. That was a big step for us. And we\u2019re like (Jay-Z) and Beyonce. We paid for parking at the head of the trail.\n\nI\u2019m still pretty cheap. I\u2019m still friends with a woman that I hate who has a lemon tree. Real success is when I can finally tell that woman, \u201cYou are a (expletive) idiot and a bad person, and I have never liked you!\u201d But I can\u2019t give up those free lemons.\n\nQ: In the book, you talk about overcoming failure. Why is that so important to you?\n\nA:It\u2019s a part of my upbringing that distinguished me from a lot of other people because my parents embraced failure. It was kind of easier to get up from it because I was taught it was a way of life and an important way of learning about yourself. That perspective, above everything, is what has helped me be able to succeed. I had hit two parked vehicles, and usually some parents would flip out. My parents were like, \"Well, now you know not to do a three-point turn on a narrow street.\" I want to instill that in my kids. I want them to not beat themselves up when they inevitably fail.\n\nQ: How do you teach them that lesson?\n\nA:It\u2019s so interesting when you become a parent and you go to an aquarium or the science center and you witness all kinds of parenting. I see parents get (ticked) at their kids when they pee their pants. Some of these kids are really young. I understand parents get really frustrated, but at the same time, it\u2019s an accident. You know? When my kid would have an accident \u2013 I don\u2019t say it didn\u2019t frustrate me \u2013 I\u2019m like \"Now you know you should listen to mommy and you should go potty when I say, \u2018Do you need to go potty?\u2019 \"\n\nQ: Do your daughters think you\u2019re funny?\n\nA:They think I\u2019m funny. I know what to do to make them laugh. Imitating a crab on the floor \u2013 that always gets them. It\u2019s a lot of slapstick humor. (Laughs) It\u2019s very vaudevillian with them. They\u2019re not very interested in word choice. There are people they think are funnier than me. Like my uncle. He was here this past weekend and he waved this blanket around them, being like, \"Did somebody fart?\" and they were cracking up. \"Booty butt\" is the funniest thing my daughter has ever heard.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/11/ali-wong-book-dear-girls-raw-and-uproariously-funny/3937820002/", "description": "Fans of Ali Wong will not be disappointed with the comedian's first book, a collection of sometimes scandalous essays called \"Dear Girls\".", "authors": ["Jennifer Mcclellan", "John Sandford", "Rachel Maddow", "Delia Owens", "Stephen King", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Published P.M.
