This has promoted Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei to consider licensing the company's 5G technology \u2014 from hardware to software and chip designs \u2014 to a U.S. firm to alleviate security concerns.\n\nThe Chinese overture seems logical at least for autos, if roadblocks are to be avoided in the next generation of autos where connectivity will be more important than horsepower.\n\nIn-car connectivity requires collaboration but that industry-wide, borderless cooperation is under threat. Even if Beijing and Washington achieve a trade resolution, and that's questionable with rising heat around impeachment leading up to the presidential race in 2020, then a tech deal is thought to be more elusive. Tech players still believe innovation will solve all problems, but what if \"Make America Great Again\" trumps tech?\n\nThe smartphone has emerged as the central connected device and is unlikely to be knocked off its perch by more connected devices. But the biggest connected device in the future, at least by size, will be the car. Imagine a self-driving car with chips and sensors to safely navigate roads, running on open digital platforms and utilizing smartphones to bring user preferences to a connected car, just like the connected home.\n\nThe in-car experience will become king, according to a recent IBM study called Automotive 2030. IBM predicts 15% of new cars sold could be fully autonomous by the end of the next decade, and less time driving will turn the focus to the digital in-car experience.", "description": "If you think the U.S.-China trade war is a problem for smartphones and 5G, spare a thought for autonomous and connected cars.", "authors": ["Karen Tso"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105676578-1547472843448gettyimages-913385804.jpg?v=1563504519", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
