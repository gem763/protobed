Around that time, a senior manager wrote on the boards that he added Mr. Cernekee to a \u201cwritten blacklist\u201d of employees he wouldn\u2019t work with.\n\nMr. Cernekee, 41 years old, spent much of the next three years battling Google over his perceived violations, and pressing his contention that right-leaning employees were being treated unfairly, according to interviews, documents and copies of posts on Google\u2019s internal message boards. In one example from 2017 that he reported to human resources, a manager publicly asked on a board about employees holding views like Mr. Cernekee's: \u201cCan\u2019t we just fire the poisonous assholes already?\u201d\n\nIn June 2018, Mr. Cernekee was fired.\n\nGoogle told Mr. Cernekee in a termination letter that he was let go for multiple violations of company policies, including improperly downloading company information and misuse of the remote-access software system. Mr. Cernekee, who hasn\u2019t spoken publicly before about his status at Google, denies that. He says he was fired for being an outspoken conservative in famously liberal Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cHistorically, there\u2019s been a lot of bullying at Google,\u201d Mr. Cernekee says. \u201cThere\u2019s a big political angle, and they treat the two sides very differently.\u201d\n\nA Google spokeswoman, Jenn Kaiser, declined to comment on the specific incidents described in this article involving Mr. Cernekee and other employees. \u201cWe enforce our workplace policies without regard to political viewpoint,\u201d Ms. Kaiser said in a statement.\n\nPolitical bias in the technology world is a headline topic in Washington, D.C., where Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump administration are increasingly ramping up heat on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and other tech platforms over perceived bias against conservatives. Google\u2019s global policy chief testified in July to Congress that political leanings don\u2019t factor into the company\u2019s decision making.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) on Thursday afternoon called the allegations of political bias troubling. In a statement after The Wall Street Journal detailed Mr. Cernekee\u2019s claims, Mr. McCarthy said Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai had earlier assured him that all viewpoints were welcome, but \u201ctime and again, we see actions that contradict free and open expression.\u201d\n\nMr. Cernekee\u2019s allegations also highlight Google\u2019s mounting struggle to rein in its fractious workplace, which has long been a place of debate over free expression. The company historically has tolerated, and even encouraged, argument on hot-button issues. Employees globally walked out last year to protest multimillion-dollar exit packages for executives accused of sexual misconduct, and Google subsequently changed some of its conduct policies.\n\nGoogle has long promoted an open corporate culture, including message boards in which employees across the world share opinions on both business and personal topics.\n\nKent Walker, Google\u2019s chief legal officer.

Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker has threatened to fire workers poking around inside the company for information on contentious topics like Google\u2019s cloud-computing relationship with the U.S. Defense Department, people familiar with the matter say. Mr. Walker wrote to staff in May, \u201cmore than ever, we need to take good care of the information we hold.\u201d\n\nIn a mid-July memo widely distributed to staff, Google said it had contacted law enforcement about an employee who released unspecified confidential information externally. The email reminded staffers to flag suspected behavior to its \u201cStop Leaks\u201d team.\n\n\u201cLively debate is a hallmark of Google\u2019s workplace culture,\u201d Ms. Kaiser said.\n\nGoogle employees across the political spectrum say rancor has risen since the 2016 election. Conservative staff started an affinity group where workers must apply to be let in. Liberal sympathizers of Google\u2019s employee walkout separately founded their own group, dubbed \u201ctransparency and ethics.\u201d A group called \u201cfree speech\u201d is little used, employees say, as the term becomes more charged.\n\nIn July, a white YouTube employee, Christopher Cukor, was filmed calling the police on a black man he suspected of breaking into his San Francisco apartment building. Mr. Cukor later apologized after it turned out the man was visiting a friend. Google owns YouTube.\n\nIn the aftermath, some Google and YouTube employees wrote on internal message boards that Mr. Cukor\u2019s presence made them feel unsafe, and that they would refuse to work with him, several people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Cukor wrote in a blog post that his father had been murdered by a trespasser outside his home.\n\nLast week, a senior Google engineer, Gregory Coppola, gave interviews to a pair of conservative media outlets and suggested the company was politically biased toward the left. Hours later, he received a call from human resources putting him on administrative leave and disabling his access to internal systems, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe walkout organizers, who lean left, also have complaints. They say the company retaliated against them because of their activism. Former YouTube marketing manager Claire Stapleton says she was \u201cbranded with a scarlet letter\u201d and demoted because of her outspokenness. Google says it investigated her claims and found them false. Ms. Stapleton quit in June with a severance package, she says.\n\nMr. Cernekee didn\u2019t receive a payout. A Chicago-area native, he is in some ways the prototypical Silicon Valley engineer. He repairs old computer equipment in his spare time and bikes on the weekends.\n\nMr. Cernekee, recently standing outside the Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif., describes himself as a mainstream Republican who supports President Trump.

Some 95% of Google employee donations to candidates in the 2018 midterm elections went to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, citing public disclosures.\n\nBefore moving to the Bay Area in 2015 to work on Google\u2019s laptop lines, Mr. Cernekee says, the region\u2019s dominant liberalism struck him as \u201cjust like something to occasionally read online and laugh at. At Google, I jumped right into the middle of it, where, holy crap, these people actually exist.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Have you ever voiced political opinions at work? What happened as a result? Join the conversation below.\n\nEarly on, he stood up for a colleague who publicly suggested that Google not consider race or gender in hiring decisions. \u201cA bunch of people jumped on him and started cussing him out and calling him names,\u201d Mr. Cernekee says. \u201cAnd then his manager showed up in the thread and denounced him in public. I was very disturbed by that.\u201d\n\nIn other posts from 2015, some of which were later cited by the company in a warning letter, he criticized a self-described feminist colleague on an internal message board, suggesting she should be more resilient to criticism. In another thread, he suggested the company add a clear statement of banned opinions to the employee handbook so conservative employees would know where the lines were drawn.\n\nIn July 2017, Google software engineer James Damore posted an internal memo suggesting that men were biologically better suited for tech jobs than women. Mr. Cernekee, who says he doesn\u2019t share that view, offered to buy Mr. Damore lunch out of curiosity.\n\nThe two were splitting a thin-crust supreme pizza when Mr. Cernekee\u2019s phone buzzed with a news alert that Mr. Damore\u2019s memo had been leaked publicly. Within a week, Mr. Damore was fired. Mr. Damore is currently in arbitration with Google over his termination.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, publicly denounced Mr. Damore\u2019s views. To suggest that \u201ccolleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK,\u201d Mr. Pichai said in an email to employees.\n\nMr. Cernekee also crossed with Republicans internally. One fellow engineer active in the company\u2019s conservative circles, Michael Wacker, internally circulated a dossier describing Mr. Cernekee as \u201cthe face of the alt-right\u201d at Google. Mr. Cernekee rejects the label. He says he disagrees with alt-right philosophy, which promotes white nationalism, and considers himself a mainstream Republican who supports President Trump. Mr. Wacker was separately fired this spring; he says Google human resources warned him his behavior was \u201crude and dishonest.\u201d\n\nConservative employees say they\u2019ve tried to raise concerns about unfair treatment to top Google executives at the company\u2019s weekly all-hands meetings, but their queries haven\u2019t made it through because questions must be voted up by a large number of employees to be heard.\n\nMr. Cernekee calls himself a whistleblower and has filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board. Several were denied; the original is pending. He\u2019s submitted materials including a human resources warning letter that says he violated the \u201cRespect Each Other\u201d section of the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAmong the posts cited was one in which he wrote that \u201cmany Googlers strongly disagree with Social Justice theory and even more Googlers are concerned about the \u2018internet mob\u2019 shaming and intimidation tactics employed in support of this agenda.\u201d A human resources executive wrote: \u201cMany Googlers were offended by your comments.\u201d Human resources flagged one such comment in which Mr. Cernekee described himself as a second-class citizen, saying Google\u2019s conduct policy bans \u201cunbusinesslike behavior.\u201d\n\nThe NLRB declined to comment.\n\nMr. Cernekee says he has spent more than $100,000 on legal fees. He now works for another technology company.\n\n\u201cI very much regret joining Google,\u201d he says. \u201cI figured it would be a good place to see intelligent arguments through. It didn\u2019t really turn out how I expected.\u201d\n\nWrite to Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com", "description": "Google told engineer Kevin Cernekee in 2018 he was being fired for misuse of equipment.
