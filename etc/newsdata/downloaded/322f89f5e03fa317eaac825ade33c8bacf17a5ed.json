Why would pilots perform such a descent?\n\nThe most likely reason the pilots took this action was a pressurization problem. The pressurization system on an airplane compresses the density of the air volume so that we\u2014you the passengers, and we, the flight crew-- can breathe normally at high altitudes where the air is less dense. The system can fail if a leak occurs in the cabin, i.e. a window breaks, or the outflow valve that allows air to escape slowly for circulation has a malfunction, or a pressurization bleed hose comes loose or develops a leak. These are extremely rare occurrences.\n\nPilots place pressurization problems in two categories: Rapid or explosive. A rapid depressurization is a situation where the cabin pressure is decreasing at a much quicker rate than normal. At some point in time the system will not be able to maintain a breathable cabin pressure. An explosive depressurization, on the other hand, is an event whereupon the cabin loses pressure almost instantly.\n\nRead More", "description": "The reports of a Delta Airlines flight on Wednesday, September 18th, en route from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale, plunging 30,000 feet, describe a dramatic experience\u2014but they appear to mischaracterize something: the incident reflects the execution of a very precise procedure, not a tumble, potentially, into oblivion.", "authors": ["Opinion Les Abend"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919185624-delta-flight-plunges-edited-thumb-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
