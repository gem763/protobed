Hours after that vote, House Democratic leaders left a White House meeting on Wednesday amid what they labeled a \"meltdown\" by the president that devolved into name calling.\n\nThis is all separate from the impeachment inquiry that continues to gain steam. Except that it all might be connected; Trump's attacks on Sen. Mitt Romney, and his veiled threats aimed at Sen. Lindsey Graham, speak to the political stakes facing the president.\n\nGraham said Wednesday, \"the problem with President Trump -- he talks like Ronald Reagan and he acts like Rand Paul on occasion.\"\n\nThe Trump doctrine is an explosive and contradictory one that, at its core, isn't always coherent -- or particularly consistent with Republican Party principles.\n\nTrump is acting as if he owns the GOP. That's only because, as of now, he still does.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden expressed relief on Wednesday following the latest Democratic primary debate and said that he appreciated other candidates, namely Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who took more of the direct fire.\n\n\"It's kind of about time other people get questioned,\" he said, putting a positive spin on the fact that the field of Democratic candidates acted Tuesday as if Warren was the bigger or more immediate threat.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the candidates who brought a piece of that fight to Warren was former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke.\n\nSpecifically, O'Rourke questioned some of Warren's proposed tax policies.\n\n\"Sometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together around those solutions,\" he said at the debate.\n\nJohn Minchillo/AP\n\nOn Thursday, O'Rourke plans to bring the fight to Trump instead. The president is traveling to O'Rouke's home state for a number of stops and an evening rally in Dallas. The former congressman plans to lead an event to counter-program the presidential visit.\n\nThere is a competitive primary underway as the Democratic Party looks to take on another sitting Lone Star State senator. Expect both parties to be out in force.\n\nThe TIP with Kendall Karson and Justin Gomez\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is capitalizing on his fiery debate performance in Ohio -- raking in tens of thousands of dollars in donations and enjoying a polling swing in his favor after going toe-to-toe with front-runner Warren over health care, fellow veteran Rep. Tulsi Gabbard on foreign policy and Democratic rival O'Rourke on gun reform.\n\nThe once unknown presidential candidate surged in popularity early this year, but then faded amongst a crowded field of Democrats, struggling since then to reach the top tier alongside Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Biden.\n\nWin Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nNow, the Midwest mayor is seeing a resurgence of support. A new post-debate poll from ABC News partner FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos shows Buttigieg gaining the largest boost, 4.5 points, amongst Democratic primary voters who say they'd consider supporting him. His net favorability rating also jumped 2.6 points, the second biggest surge of any Democrat, behind only Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nWithin a 24-hour period, his campaign was also injected with new fuel, raising $1 million since the end of the debate. While others have tried and failed at executing an aggressive strategy on stage at the three previous debates, the 38-year-old may have successfully pulled it off and found new footing for the critical months ahead.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast.
