The complaint, which was released to the public on Thursday, focuses primarily on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election and to help discredit the Russia investigation.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was a key figure in the push and that Attorney General William Barr \"appears to be involved as well.\" It said Trump urged Zelensky to \"meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem.\"\n\nNotably, the whistleblower said they were not a direct witness to the conduct described in the complaint or to Trump's conversation with Zelensky but learned of it from \"multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\"\n\nThe whistleblower said they heard \"various facts related to\" it from more than half a dozen US officials. \"Multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe complaint said White House officials who informed the whistleblower of Trump's call were \"deeply disturbed\" by what they had heard.

Devin Nunes asked Maguire whether it was \"normal for the president of the United States to have their conversations\" with foreign leaders \"leak out.\"\n\n\"This is the third time,\" Nunes said.\n\n\"I wouldn't say the White House, but there are individuals within the White House that may or may not,\" Maguire said. \"I don't know. But it would not be from an intelligence intercept, I will say that.\"\n\nNunes also suggested that someone within the intelligence community was responsible for leaking information about the complaint to the media before the document was released to the public on Thursday.\n\n\"What I'm trying to ascertain is how would it run in all the mainstream media outlets?\" Nunes said of the complaint. \"Even though they got a lot of it wrong, but they had the basics of it, that it involved the president of the United States talking to a foreign leader. So did anybody \u2014 you or anybody in your office \u2014 leak this to The Washington Post or NBC News?\"\n\n\"Ranking member, I lead the intelligence community \u2014 we know how to keep a secret,\" Maguire said. \"As far as how that got into the press, I really do not know, sir.\"\n\nExecutive-branch officials routinely listen in on the president's phone calls to take notes, which are shared with government agencies tasked with carrying out the president's policies.\n\nMaguire added that \"it was not from the intelligence community, from me, or from my office.\"", "description": "A whistleblower complaint that an intelligence official filed against Trump cites multiple White House officials as its source.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b58703ed30cd41c008b4691?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
