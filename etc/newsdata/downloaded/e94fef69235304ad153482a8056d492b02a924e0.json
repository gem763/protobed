Photo: Marc Brenner\n\nNear the end of Betrayal\u2014or near the beginning of the betrayal within Betrayal, since Harold Pinter\u2019s 1978 play about a seven-year affair runs in reverse, from the infidelity\u2019s aftermath to its inception\u2014a soused would-be lover rattles on a bit.: \u201cLook at the way you\u2019re looking at me. I can\u2019t wait for you, I\u2019m bowled over, I\u2019m totally knocked out, you dazzle me \u2026 My life is in your hands, that\u2019s what you\u2019re banishing me to, a state of catatonia, do you know the State of Catatonia? Do you? Do you? The state of \u2026 where the reigning prince is the prince of emptiness, the prince of absence, the prince of desolation. I love you.\u201d\n\nIn the royal family of Western drama, Pinter himself might be exactly the figure his intoxicated, infatuated character describes. His laconic, subtly brutal plays\u2014known for the loaded pauses that now bear the writer\u2019s adjectivized name\u2014float precariously on a dark reservoir of things unsaid. His characters are like those waterbugs who balance above the depths on the delicate force of surface tension. He is not a universal taste, and mediocre Pinter productions have their own particular kind of cringiness: They feel like acting exercises. Even in sure-footed ventures into the Pinterverse\u2014such as Jamie Lloyd\u2019s lean and sexy revival starring Tom Hiddleston, now visiting New York after its London premiere\u2014there can be an element of technical gloss to contend with. You can feel, as I did, like you\u2019re watching Good Actors Acting Well, which is a matter of intellect rather than emotion. Impressive and interesting, yes. Devastating? (Pause.) Well.\n\nLloyd\u2019s production is cool, confident, and mercifully aware of Pinter\u2019s sense of humor. Some of its strongest moments are its unsmiling jokes, which Lloyd\u2019s actors attack like fencers, pricking without overextending. Hiddleston\u2014with his fixed blue stare and his ability to lock his jaw into a mask of British propriety, unmistakably undergirded with menace\u2014is particularly adept with the playwright\u2019s distinctive rhythms, his smirks, evasions, and threats. A vapid conversation between Hiddleston\u2019s character, Robert, and his best friend Jerry (Charlie Cox) about whether boy babies are \u201cmore anxious\u201d than girl babies becomes a master class in hard-edged, straight-faced comedy. But then the whole play has that \u201cmaster class\u201d feel to it: As much as the phrase has become a critical clich\u00e9 for a tour de force, it\u2019s not the same thing as \u201cmasterpiece.\u201d There\u2019s expertise on display, but there\u2019s an academic distance to it too.\n\nPart of the distancing effect might be that Hiddleston undoubtedly outshines his fellow actors, who are solid (and equally great-looking \u2014 this is Pinter with highly paid personal trainers) but never quite as at home in the material. Cox comes close, and indeed, his role gives him less of an ability to stand still and shoot lasers from his eyes, as Robert gets to. He has to maneuver, stumble, and course-correct more, and he does so with a bemused, affable charm that belies a deeply selfish character. Part of Betrayal\u2019s fascination is that Jerry, who\u2019s been having a hidden affair with Robert\u2019s wife Emma (Zawe Ashton) for seven years, is in fact the \u201cPinter\u201d role. From 1962 to 1969, Pinter himself concealed from his wife an affair with the BBC presenter Joan Bakewell (for her highly compelling take on their now immortalized-if-somewhat-fictionalized infidelity, click here). It\u2019s arguable, though, that for all the playwright\u2019s own experience inside a dangerous liaison, his play belongs not to the betrayers but to the betrayed. At least in Lloyd\u2019s production, Robert\u2014his moment of awakening and his eventual hardening of himself as a result\u2014is the heart of the show.\n\nIt\u2019s structural\u2014the torturous scene in which Emma admits the affair to Robert sits smack-dab in the middle of the play\u2014but it\u2019s also a matter of actor and director inclination. As Robert slowly learns the truth about Jerry and Emma, Hiddleston sits stone still and silently weeps until the snot hangs in ropes from his nose. There were quiet gasps in my audience when it started to drip, unheeded by this broken man in his moment of crisis. \u201cAh. Yes. I thought it might be something like that, something along those lines,\u201d says Robert, with extreme Britishness, when Emma confesses \u2014 but there\u2019s so much raw emotion pulsing underneath Hiddleston\u2019s performance, and overflowing its container in this one pivotal scene, that the character can\u2019t help but become the play\u2019s tragic center. The way Hiddleston plays Robert, it\u2019s difficult to believe it when Emma tells Jerry, \u201cYou know what I found out\u2026 last night? He\u2019s betrayed me for years. He\u2019s had\u2026 other women for years.\u201d\n\nDespite the real power of Hiddleston\u2019s performance, that empathy gap strikes me as a flaw. We can\u2019t quite take Emma at her word (we\u2019ve also heard her lie on other important matters), and so the scales of Lloyd\u2019s play end up tipped rather than balanced. It seems to be a play about a victim and two perpetrators \u2014 but I think it\u2019s a play about three people, all of whom we should empathize with, all of whom we should mistrust, all of whom are capable of great selfishness. Ashton has the hardest job: Emma\u2019s got that sense of mystery about her that sometimes happens when men, even very talented men, write women. The scenes between Robert and Jerry, though often tense and terse, feel lived, red-blooded, affectionate. Emma often seems ethereal \u2014 her motivations and actual desires somehow far away. (For a real bust-up of that trope, get into Bakewell\u2019s essay \u2014 there\u2019s no mystery woman there; instead there\u2019s a super-smart Cambridge grad who was expected to become a housewife and mother at 25.) The character is already the most opaque in the play, and Ashton\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t do much to elucidate her. Tall and willowy, with bare feet and a dancer\u2019s limbs, she tucks her hair behind her ears, tilts her head and half smiles. It\u2019s clear she likes Jerry\u2019s attention, but it\u2019s not clear where her own deep hungers lie. Lloyd has her leaning into the enigmatic aura Pinter gave Emma, and it renders Ashton less visceral and\u2014and this is the real problem\u2014less sympathetic than her male counterparts.\n\nStill, Lloyd\u2019s stripped-to-the-bone approach to the play\u2019s environment lets the text breathe and stretch. We can really hear Pinter\u2019s words pinging off the big blank wall of Soutra Gilmour\u2019s set, with its neutral palette and vast, clean emptiness that put us in mind of the art gallery where Emma works. In this white box, the three actors move like dark ghosts, memories of themselves with all the clutter stripped away. They turn slowly on a big revolve, and, crucially, Lloyd keeps all three present throughout, so that the shadow presence of the third always influences scenes between the other two. The staging restores some of the balance that\u2019s lost in the performances. It brings back the sense that any affair, especially one that involves friends, is in fact a triangle, and that out at the corners of such a hard, angular form, even in our desperate flight from loneliness, we\u2019re more isolated than ever.\n\nBetrayal is at the Jacobs Theatre.", "description": "Theater Review: Revival of Harold Pinter\u2019s \u2018Betrayal\u2019 Opens on Broadway Starring Tom Hiddleston Directed by Jamie Lloyd", "authors": ["Sara Holdren"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/05/05-the-betrayal.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
