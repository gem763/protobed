It\u2019s about storytelling for women, by women, and about getting more women behind the camera,' said the Wild star.\n\n'I do meetings in the morning while I\u2019m getting my hair and makeup done. After that, the people who run my companies take over, and I focus on acting. Acting is still my core competency.

I was nursing Ava on set, and Jen just kept going, \"You have a baby?\" I was like, \"I know, it's weird.\"'\n\nWhile Reese's character was only featured in two episodes, Jennifer was on hand to calm her nerves throughout the process.\n\n'She was so sweet to me.' Witherspoon said.

We\u2019ve been friends ever since.'\n\nThe powerful pair are joined together once again playing somewhat competitive journalists who face off on The Morning Show.\n\nBabies: Reese portrayed Jennifer's kid sister Jill Green on the popular program and was only 23-years-old when her budding friendship with the 50-year-old actress began\n\n'Our characters are two people with very similar goals but different ideologies because of their backgrounds,' Reese said. 'Jen\u2019s character existed in a world that was dominated by men. Just the fact that she existed was all that mattered.\n\n'My character is like, \"Hold on, no, no, no. If you\u2019re not bringing other women with you, what are you doing?\" It\u2019s not antagonistic or competitive. It\u2019s second-wave feminism meets fourth-wave feminism.'\n\nThey star alongside Carell and Billy Crudup in the AppleTV+ program which premieres on November 1.", "description": "The 43-year-old blonde beauty shares a meal with her husband Jim Toth and her two sons Deacon and Tennessee (Ava is off at college) on a regular basis, she told Harper's Bazaar.", "authors": ["Heidi Parker", "Tracy Wright For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/19/19409366-0-image-a-132_1570473459660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
