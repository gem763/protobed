When he calls the police, the group quickly disperses.\n\nThe Strada Maggiore protest was one of many held since the Padrone di Merda group was set up in January in Bologna, a wealthy city known for its food and its university. The group targeted 16 businesses over the following months, mostly restaurants and bars.\n\nRenowned for lasagne, tortellini and tagliatelle al rag\u00f9 (an inauthentic variant of which is known in the English-speaking world as \u201cspaghetti bolognese\u201d, to the annoyance of many Italians, including Bologna\u2019s mayor), the city has a lively and growing dining scene with more than 400 restaurants, pubs and cafes in the central zone \u2013 one for every 37 residents.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bologna has a lively and growing dining scene.

A 2017 government report estimated that the illegal \u201cgrey economy\u201d accounted for 72.6% of jobs in the city \u2013 a record even in Italy, where undeclared employment is common.\n\nUniversity students are especially vulnerable to illegal, benefits-free employment because they need to pay for their studies and see it as transitional, says Francesco Devincenti of the Filcams trade union. The situation has worsened over the past decade because hard-up parents are giving less and less money to their students, says one of the Padrone di Merda activists, who uses the pseudonym Davide.\n\nThe Padrone di Merda movement started after a group of young Bologna residents started to share stories of their work experiences \u201cand saw they were very similar\u201d, says one of the founders, a university student who uses the pseudonym Barbara.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Members of Padrone di Merda protest at a high-end pastry shop in Bologna where an employee says he hasn\u2019t been paid for months. Photograph: Marta Clinco\n\nThe group\u2019s first action targeted a bar accused of sexual harassment of employees. \u201c[Then] we opened the Facebook page and received many more reports,\u201d Barbara continues. \u201cFor example, there was a pizzeria that changed employees every three months and where the owner insisted on being called \u2018la signora\u2019 (the lady).\u201d\n\nThey do not deliver social justice but carry out vendettas for those who want to damage the image of their employers, perhaps unjustly Umberto Bosco, politician\n\nAs well as receiving complaints through the Facebook page, activists spot allegations of bad employers in local newspaper reports or on social media. Before organising any protest, Barbara says they first make inquiries to verify the complaints, partly because they fear owners might use fake accounts to try to unmask their identities.\n\nThe group uses its stickers to alert the public that a place is accused of exploiting workers both to discourage customers and because they believe the warning might convince employers to act more fairly in the future. \u201cWe put them up in the hope of not having to come back,\u201d says Barbara. \u201cWhen you are a victim, everyone is supportive but nothing changes. But if you open a Pandora\u2019s box and the owners are afraid of image damage, then things can change.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The owner of the high-end pastry shop photographs one of the group\u2019s stickers.

In March, Paci wrote on his Facebook page that he hadn\u2019t been paid in four months. \u201cI decided to do it after seeing a sponsored interview with the owner who owed me wages,\u201d he says.\n\nHow the 'Las Vegas of Italy' is kicking its slot machine addiction Read more\n\nThe post was shared by more than 1,700 people and spotted by the group, who organised a protest. Paci believes the actions of Padrone di Merda \u201chighlight a widespread problem\u201d in Bologna, although he declined their invitation to take part in the demonstration, because he was \u201cnot convinced of their methods\u201d.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the group\u2019s critics responded. Umberto Bosco, a Northern League politician, presented a formal question to the municipal council criticising the group\u2019s methods.\n\n\u201cWe have tools to fight injustices, there are plenty of laws [against exploitation] and placing a hidden camera can be a way of documenting injustices,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in this case, the group doesn\u2019t provide evidence. They do not deliver social justice but carry out vendettas for those who want to damage the image of their employers, perhaps unjustly.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Padrone di Merda activists engaged in a protest. Photograph: Marta Clinco\n\nThis summer a snack bar owner accused by Padrone di Merda of not paying his employees asked the city authorities to block the group\u2019s Facebook page, arguing that he had been slandered by false accusations. Although the case was never brought to court, the authorities pre-emptively asked Facebook to remove the page.\n\nBut the public Facebook page remains live. In 2016 the US State Department sent a message to Italian prosecutors dissuading them from asking Facebook to reveal the identities behind anonymous profiles in defamation cases because they would not comply. \u201cThe statements written on the social network \u2026 however defamatory, are covered by the principle of freedom of opinion,\u201d the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano quoted American authorities as saying.\n\nPadrone di Merda has also set up a new closed Facebook group so its members can coordinate with activists from other cities, including Turin, Pisa and Rome, in the hope of expanding its protests. \u201cWe have received many requests from people who want to take similar action in other cities,\u201d says Davide, who adds that the Bologna protests will continue, possibly as early as this month. \u201cWe will go ahead, social network or not.\u201d\n\n\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "The anonymous members of Il Padrone di Merda (\u201ccrappy boss\u201d) stage protests outside employers in the Italian city who are accused of exploiting their workers", "authors": ["Giorgio Ghiglione"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661bb94b35ac81a43a01dd71015d8b6952243475/0_127_3813_2288/master/3813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b35e8bebbcf72e108c37b552188d1061", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
