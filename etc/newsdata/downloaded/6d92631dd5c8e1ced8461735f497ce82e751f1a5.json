Although he outlined some ideas, he didn\u2019t give any detail about how he proposed to do it.\n\n\u201cI want to find a deal,\u201d Mr. Johnson said during a news conference in Ireland\u2019s capital. \u201cI have looked carefully at no-deal. Yes, we could do it, the U.K. could certainly get through it, but be in no doubt that outcome would be a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible. I would overwhelmingly prefer to find an agreement.\u201d\n\nThe biggest obstacle to a deal remains the so-called Irish backstop, a plan to avoid a physical border emerging after Brexit between Ireland, an EU member, and the U.K. region of Northern Ireland.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Will Boris Johnson be able to persuade the Irish government to back his plan for avoiding a a physical border after Brexit? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Johnson has described the proposal, negotiated between his predecessor and the EU, as unacceptable because, he says, it would leave Britain closely tied to the EU indefinitely even after its split.\n\nMr. Johnson traveled to Dublin hours ahead of a vote in Britain\u2019s Parliament that was expected to reject his call for fresh elections for a second time in a week. Opposition lawmakers are refusing to back a general election until they have ruled out the prospect of a no-deal exit on Oct. 31, the current date on which the U.K. is meant to leave the EU.\n\nQueen Elizabeth on Monday signed the bill aimed at preventing such an exit into law.\n\nAfter Monday\u2019s vote, the government was set to suspend Parliament until mid-October, the government\u2019s spokesman said.\n\nThe law that came into effect Monday requires the government to ask the EU to further delay the U.K.\u2019s exit until Jan. 31 if an agreement isn\u2019t secured by Oct. 19 with the bloc. Its passage last week was a serious defeat for Mr. Johnson\u2019s government.\n\nFurther, two cabinet ministers have since quit his government, including his brother, Jo Johnson, and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, both of whom supported Britain remaining in the EU during the 2016 referendum campaign.\n\nThe demand for such an extension puts Mr. Johnson in a bind. He has pledged to not delay the U.K.\u2019s split with the EU, but now under the law the British government must request the agreement of the other 27 member states for an extension. Brexit has been twice postponed from the original U.K. date of March 29.\n\nEuropean officials say the bloc would agree to an extension to allow an election to take place. However, the government\u2019s spokesman said Mr. Johnson would refuse to seek an extension to Brexit from the EU; he wouldn\u2019t say answer the question whether the prime minister would resign rather than ask for a delay.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has said it would obey any laws Parliament passes. If Mr. Johnson does quit, it would open the way for a caretaker government to form a majority in the House of Commons and request a delay.\n\nWith Parliament suspended, Britain\u2019s political parties will step up their informal election campaigning during a period when they hold their traditional annual conferences. Even though the government\u2019s immediate call for an election is expected to be rejected, most lawmakers say a general election is almost inevitable before the end of the year.\n\nIn Dublin, Mr. Johnson said alternative arrangements could achieve the same goal as the backstop and outlined what he described as the \u201clanding zone\u201d for a new solution to replace it. He said this would involve electronic customs checks for goods and common rules on animal health and related agricultural regulations for the two parts of the island.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cIf you can do both of those things you can get a long way through the problem,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, without elaborating on the proposals.\n\nMr. Varadkar appeared skeptical, and reiterated his commitment to the backstop unless the U.K. government comes up with a better alternative. \u201cNo backstop is no deal for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAn EU spokeswoman said technical talks would continue in Brussels this week between the U.K. and EU. She said the U.K. had discussed some ideas but hadn\u2019t presented any concrete proposals.\n\nIn another development on Monday, House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would step down at the end of October unless a general election is held before then.\n\nMr. Bercow has drawn criticism from pro-Brexit lawmakers who say he has spurned convention to give pro-EU lawmakers time in the House of Commons to rule out a no-deal exit. His replacement will be chosen by a secret ballot among lawmakers in the first session after he steps down.\n\n\u2014Max Colchester in London contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stuck to his pledge that the U.K. would leave the European Union on Oct. 31\u2014even as a bill aimed at preventing the country from leaving on that date without an agreement became law.", "authors": ["Paul Hannon In London", "Jason Douglas In Dublin", "Paul Hannon", "Jason Douglas", "Paul.Hannon Wsj.Com", "Jason.Douglas Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105223/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
