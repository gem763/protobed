It will formally request bilateral consultations with Japan on Wednesday as the first step in the WTO dispute settlement process, said Yoo Myung-hee, a senior official at South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.\n\nJapan in July imposed tighter export controls on three chemicals South Korean companies use to produce semiconductors and displays for smartphones and TVs, citing unspecified security concerns over South Korea\u2019s export controls on sensitive materials that could be used for military purposes.\n\nThe measures, which weeks later were followed by Japan\u2019s move to exclude South Korea from its \u201cwhite list\u201d of countries with fast-track trade status, triggered a full-blown diplomatic row that saw relations sink to a low unseen in decades\n\nSouth Korea says Japan\u2019s trade measures threaten its export-dependent economy, where many manufacturers rely on materials and parts imported from Japan. It claims Tokyo is retaliating over South Korean court rulings that called for Japanese companies to offer reparations to aging South Korean plaintiffs over World War II forced labor.\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s export restriction on the three materials were based on political motivation related to rulings by our Supreme Court on forced labor ... It was a discriminatory measure that directly targets only our country,\u201d Yoo said in a news conference.\n\nIf Japan accepts South Korea\u2019s request, the countries must hold consultations for a minimum 60 days. If Japan refuses the consultations or if the talks fail, South Korea could request a WTO panel ruling on the dispute. The process usually takes about 15 months but may also last years, said Jeong Hae-seong, a South Korean trade ministry official.\n\nYoo said the country is also considering whether to pursue WTO action over Japan\u2019s move to delist South Korea as a preferential trade partner.", "description": "South Korea is filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization over Japan\u2019s tightened export controls on key materials South Korean companies use to...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO205_skorea_ZG_20190725224838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
