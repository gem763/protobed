This user struggled to access charge points at John Lennon airport\n\nOther say there simply aren't enough chargers available to cater for the growing number of electric vehicles on the road - despite there being just over 200k on the road\n\nNot every user has had a negative experience with Ecotricity's network, though...\n\nDrivers will hope that the addition of 3,000 new government-funded fast chargers will mean more dependable charging availability for long journeys.\n\nThe addition will take the total available in 2024 to 5,000 and offer much shorter charging periods, according to the Department for Transport's announcement.\n\nToday's rapid chargers are typically capable of delivering electricity at a minimum of 50 kilowatts (kW), which can generally boost an vehicle's batteries up to 80 per cent capacity in around 40 minutes.\n\nHowever, the DfT promises that new installations will be able to charge an electric vehicle in as little as 20 minutes - so just half the time.\n\nTesla's Model 3, which was the third most registered new model in the UK last month, can already accept up to 200kW of charge - four times what current UK fast chargepoints offer.\n\nPorsche's recently unveiled Taycan electric sports car can receive up to 270kW, while VW's ID.3 - a sub-\u00a330,000 family hatchback revealed last week - can accept up to 100kW.\n\nThe DfT says the new chargers will be able to replenish the batteries of electric vehicles in half the time it takes the current charge points\n\nSouthampton is best-equipped city for electric cars, says new study A new study has named Southampton as the city that's best equipped to cater for electric car owners. Researchers looked at the UK\u2019s 10 most congested cities and worked out which is best reading for an influx of plug-in cars. This is based on a variety of factors: the number of public EV charging points that are already available; the growth of the changing network in the last six months; the city's existing population; the number of plug-in vehicles registered there; and residents\u2019 opinions towards electric cars. The south coast city took the top spot because it had 7.53 chargers per 100 EVs registered in the area and had seen a 13 per cent rise in available charge points since the start of the year. Brighton & Hove ranked second on the list and Portsmouth in third, meaning electric car drivers are going to be best served on the south coast. London, which has the highest volume of registered electric models, was ranked at number 10 in EuroCarParts' study, with just 3.21 per 100 plug-in cars in the capital.\n\nPlug-in car grant looks set to be removed\n\nInvestment in the public charging network is seen as fundamental if the Government is to stick to its plan to ban on the sale of all new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 - as are incentives to encourage drivers to switch to electrified vehicles.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped minsters reducing subsidies to help motorists buy plug-in cars.\n\nJust last year, the Department for Transport cut the grant for 'category 1' pure electric models to \u00a33,500 (reduced from \u00a34,500) and terminated it entirely for qualifying plug-in hybrids.\n\nAnd in a recent interview, new transport secretary, Grant Shapps, admitted that he wants to end the grant entirely.\n\n'I make no bones about it. We want to remove all the subsidy,' Shapps told the Times.\n\n'So you can see this in two ways. If you are out there reading this, thinking of buying an electric car, buy it while the subsidy\u2019s there, because it will go eventually.'\n\nHe went on to add that he couldn\u2019t promise 'lots of extra public bungs of taxpayers\u2019 cash so you can buy your new car'.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Times, new transport secretary, Grant Shapps (pictured), admitted that he wants to end the plug-in car grant entirely, removing the subsidy of \u00a33,500\n\nMr Shapps has recently used the grant he wants to remove himself, receiving a full subsidy of \u00a33,500 to help him purchase one of the first Tesla Model 3s to arrive in the UK\n\nMr Shapps comments have come just weeks after the transport boss himself benefited from the grant that government wants to eventually remove, receiving a full subsidy of \u00a33,500 towards the purchase of a new \u00a344,090 Tesla.\n\nRemoving the grant altogether is likely to cause huge frustration for motorists and the industry, with recent declines in low-emission vehicle sales - especially plug-in hybrids cars - blamed on last year's decision to slash the grant.\n\nThe Government has committed to continue with the plug-in grant until 2020, but has provided few details of what will happen beyond this deadline.\n\nThe Road to Zero document, published in October 2018, states: 'As the market becomes better established and more competitive, the need for direct government financial support will decrease.\n\n'We therefore expect to deliver a managed exit from the grant in due course and to continue to support the uptake of ultra low emission vehicles through other measures.'", "description": "The Government confirmed last week that it will invest a total of \u00a3400m to help bolster the public charging network, with some of this funding the installation of 3,000 rapid chargers over five years.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
