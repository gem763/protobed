She worked as a crime reporter at the Times-Picayune in the 1990s.\n\nTHE YELLOW HOUSE By Sarah M. Broom Grove.\n\n376 pp. $26\n\n\n\nSarah M. Broom, the youngest of 12 children, traces the history of her working-class family, their house and their New Orleans neighborhood. (Adam Shemper/courtesy of Sarah M. Broom)\n\nThere is a New Orleans without Mardi Gras beads, without gators or gumbo. It\u2019s a place far from Bourbon Street and without a hint of voodoo.\n\nIt\u2019s a place I knew well when I lived in the city. And that\u2019s not a good thing. I was a crime reporter at the time, not a person you wanted in your neighborhood.\n\nSarah M. Broom\u2019s stirring memoir, \u201cThe Yellow House,\u201d is set in this New Orleans. It\u2019s New Orleans East, a part of the city that tourists, poets and drawling Big Easy narratives don\u2019t visit. It\u2019s the place where the creators of the magic \u2014 cooks, bellhops, maintenance crews \u2014 live their lives.\n\nBroom describes it on a bus ride home: \u201cAll of us who had traveled to the French Quarter for work from elsewhere wore the day\u2019s labor on our bodies. We could place each other instantly by our uniforms: Napoleon House workers wore all black with white lettering on the breast pocket. . . . If you wore the grass-green outfit, the ugliest of them all, you worked at the Monteleone Hotel.\u201d\n\nThe memoir is a delightful, deft, familiar \u2014 and ambitious \u2014 foray into family dynamics and working-class gusto, a relatable story of the townies in a city overrun by, and dependent upon, tourists.\n\nThe yellow house is the Broom family\u2019s home in New Orleans East. It is their pride, hope and prison, guiding readers through the struggles of a black, working-class family. When Hurricane Katrina shatters their lives and scatters the family across the country, the book becomes far more urgent \u2014 and, I would argue, crucial. The yellow house is gutted by the issues confronting us today: pernicious racism, corporate greed, displacement and the improbable arithmetic of survival as a member of the working poor.\n\nBroom is the youngest of a 12-child, blended family. Accordingly, she begins with her own archaeological expedition into all the funny and poignant family history she missed, being the \u201cbabiest\u201dof the bunch. She is a griot telling the story of an American black family, embroidering the family tree with sharp reportage that explains nicknames, courtships, awkward studio portraits, family lore and the cruel everydayness of the era\u2019s segregation.\n\nBroom\u2019s mother, Ivory Mae, said she and her siblings were raised by a hard-working mother who tried to shield them from racism. \u201cBut Joseph, Elaine and Ivory had only to walk to the curb outside their Roman Street house to see Taylor Park and its sign: NO N-----S, NO CHINESE AND NO DOGS. It was a strange sight, the mostly empty, fenced-in park in a black neighborhood.\u201d\n\n\n\nSarah M. Broom sits on her mother Ivory Mae inside the Yellow House. (Courtesy of Sarah M. Broom)\n\nThe (not always yellow) house appears in the story after Ivory Mae loses her first husband, who was killed by a hit-and-run driver while walking on the road outside Fort Hood, Tex., not long after he enlisted in the Army, a \u201cblack man run over while walking home, no explanation whatsoever, no fuss, no arrests,\u201d Broom writes.\n\nBut the young father of two left a legacy: a life insurance policy. And that helped Ivory Mae buy the yellow house for $3,200 when she was just 19, becoming the first person in her immediate family to own a house. They were one of the only black families to move into a real estate experiment called New Orleans East, built atop a vast cypress swamp with ground too soft to support three people standing on it and \u2014 it would turn out \u2014 too soft to support the hubris of the Texas investors who built on it.\n\nThe Texans drained the swamp and erected a city of the future atop soggy land bounded by Lake Pontchartrain, the Mississippi River, Lake Borgne and the notorious Industrial Canal. Developers touted a space-age playground with shopping malls and an ice rink for the employees of the growing oil and gas industry and a nearby NASA facility. A New York Times article marveled at the vision: \u201cCity within a city rising in the South.\u201d\n\nIvory Mae married again, to the author\u2019s father, Simon Broom, one of the NASA workers. He brought more children and verve and merriment to the yellow house, fixing it with slapdash, good-enough husbandry and filling it with parties and music and laughter.\n\nIn 1965, Hurricane Betsy arrived.\n\n\n\nSarah M. Broom's brother Michael Broom (center) poses with friends in New Orleans. (Courtesy of Sarah M. Broom)\n\n\u201cI was a tiny boy,\u201d her brother Michael remembered. \u201cWater was so high. I\u2019m swimming, I\u2019m swimming. The dogs, too. The water was moving through here like we was in a river.\u201d\n\n\u201cHundreds marooned on roofs as swollen waters rip levee. Hurricane Betsy leaves New Orleans with 16-foot flood,\u201d said the front page of the Chicago Tribune.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThe Broom family recovered, but the rest of New Orleans East didn\u2019t. The investors didn\u2019t make good on their vision, and the folks who could afford to leave did. The Brooms stayed, Simon Broom died, and the family struggled to keep the ailing house together while the neighborhood decayed around them.\n\nBroom watched New Orleans East collapse on itself and her neighbors move away one after another; it was about this time that my job kept bringing me down Chef Menteur Highway. Parking lots were where you got robbed, residential streets were where johns got laid.\n\nBroom was too embarrassed to bring friends over. \u201cProstitution on Chef Menteur Highway seemed the only industry still booming, not a downturn in sight,\u201d she writes.\n\nShe fled to college, moved to New York and had a dream job working for O Magazine. Then Katrina struck, and the legacy of New Orleans\u2019s struggles sucked her back in.\n\nThe yellow house twisted and broke in two. The family scattered to Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Arizona and California. New Orleanians didn\u2019t usually leave New Orleans. In 2000, the city had the highest concentration \u2014 77 percent \u2014 of residents who stayed where they were born. That changed with Katrina, which drained half the city\u2019s population.\n\nThree years after the storm, which she called \u201cthe Water,\u201d Broom returned to New Orleans to work in the mayor\u2019s office and write the story of this great city\u2019s recovery. She quit after six months and explains the debacle with refreshing honesty.\n\nIt reads like real-life reporting from a Kafka book, an absurd world where paperwork is perpetually deemed incomplete, then lost again and again, and where a home is demolished after only one notice is sent to the broken, empty house.\n\n\n\nSarah M.

Broom)\n\n\u201cMore and more I began to feel that I was on the wrong side of the fence, selling a recovery that wasn\u2019t exactly happening for real people,\u201d she writes, and confesses to what she thought of the mayor\u2019s Road Home recovery program she was hired to tout. \u201cRoad to nowhere, I had taken to calling it.\u201d\n\nWhen she left the office to find stories of recovery to add to Mayor Ray Nagin\u2019s speeches, she came up short. \u201cApartment complexes everywhere were still in ruins. It looked like the day after the Water, minus the flooding.\u201d\n\nAnd for those who had returned, \u201cbasic services such as trash pickup and water drainage were still scarce. Mounds of debris remained,\u201d she writes.\n\nBroom\u2019s work here is an investigative reporter\u2019s shaming story \u2014 from the profiteers who lured families to New Orleans East, to the failed Road Home recovery program that actually thwarted most residents\u2019 returns \u2014 of our era\u2019s messed-up priorities.\n\nAnd we are left with the poignant vigil one of her brothers keeps over the plot of land where the yellow house once stood. He mows it weekly, tending to the fading memory of a home, when there is no home to return to.", "description": "Sarah M.
