With the discounts on pre-registered examples found, you can get one for around the same price as a new Audi A4\n\nIn one case the discount on a \u00a376,500 19-plate vehicle with just 11 miles on the clock is \u00a330,500 - representing a saving of around \u00a32,775 per mile.\n\nAs well as the emission deadline, dealers have already been struggling to meet sales targets.\n\nAnd with widespread deals on new models with the latest 69 registration plate introduced this month, retailers have been left with little to no choice but to further slash prices on the pre-registered stock.\n\n'This means savvy car buyers can make savings on some Audi and Volkswagen models of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a330,000, though huge discounts are available across many other popular makes of car,' BuyaCar said.\n\nFor example, it found a Citroen C4 SpaceTourer, registered this year on a 19 plate with \u00a39,681 off the retail price.\n\nThat\u2019s a discount of over a third (35 per cent) on the original price, working out at nearly \u00a31,000 off for each of the 10 miles on the clock.\n\nIt's not just big thirsty diesels that are being discounted - examples of petrol Citroen C3s were found with nearly 40% shaved off the list price\n\nEven popular small cars are being cleared out at enormous discounts.\n\nA Fiat 500 1.2 Pop with just one mile on the clock has \u00a33,570 off - a price cut of nearly a third compared with what it should have cost just a few months ago.\n\nAnd analysts spotted an equally-dinky Citroen C1 1.0 VTi Feel city car with nearly 40 per cent off, with a discount of \u00a34,730 on the original new price of \u00a312,120.\n\nAustin Collins, managing director at BuyaCar.co.uk, said it's not uncommon for nearly new cars to be sold at big discounts but has been 'struck by the offers' on pre-registered cars currently that have barely turned a wheel.\n\n'In several cases, the distances recorded on the clock suggest the car has probably only been driven off the transporter and into the showroom before being moved once or twice around the forecourt,' he told This is Money.\n\n'It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that there has never been a better time to buy a new car but when the market is proving as tough for dealers as it is today, the need to clear unsold stock really does lead to amazing bargains.'\n\nBuyaCar found a deal on a pre-registered Peugeot 108, offering a barely-driven example with \u00a34,500 off the \u00a312,500 retail price\n\nAnalysts at BuyaCar are also expecting September\u2019s 69 plate to begin appearing on nearly-new pre-registered cars - again with large discounts - even before the month is over.\n\nThis is because dealers often rely on the bonuses paid to them by manufacturers for meeting new car registration targets as their main source of profit.\n\n'If September proves to be as difficult a sales month for dealers as the rest of 2019 has been, the pressure to register more cars than they can store is likely to mean another fire sale in the run-up to the end of the year,' the car retail site said.", "description": "Dealers were forced to pre-register large numbers of new cars in the final days of August due to an impeding emission deadline.
