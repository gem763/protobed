But step inside Semaphore\u2019s first Apothecary to discover a property nothing short of the ordinary.\n\nOffered to the market for the first time since 1846, 111 Semaphore Rd, has been perfectly preserved for 173 years, still displaying the original cabinets, bookcases, medicine bottles, wallpaper and fireplace.\n\nMORE NEWS:\n\nHow much would you pay for a tennis court?\n\nHeavenly restoration: Former Eyre Peninsula church listed for sale\n\nRustic cottage offers a \u201clow entry\u201d into desirable North Adelaide\n\nThe historic shopfront will be the showpiece at the property\u2019s auction on October 26, which also includes a second character home and 2023sqm of land.\n\nMarketed without a price guide, selling agent Kate Smith of Harcourts Smith Semaphore said the sale was expected to set a new residential sales record for the suburb.\n\n30-34 Hall St, Semaphore, which sold in 2016 for $2.625 million, is the current record holder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unique and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had one of this age before,\u201d Ms Smith said.\n\n\u201cOur understanding is that it was the original chemist of Semaphore. We also believe it was the apothecary, so that\u2019s where they would do all the mixing and blending of the drugs.\n\n\u201cWe also believe that this was an old school house at one stage.\u201d\n\nDespite having only been launched to the market four days ago, Ms Smith said inquiries for the property were coming in fast.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of possibilities here. The shop building itself can\u2019t be knocked down. It isn\u2019t heritage listed as such but it is recognised as a property of local contributory value, so the council would not like for you to take it down.\n\n\u201cNext door, however, is not listed, so there are a number of ways you could go.\n\n\u201cYou could retain this property and knock down next door and open up some extra blocks, or you could go up a few stories and build an apartment or hotel.\n\n\u201cThis is the last opportunity on Semaphore\u2019s main street to develop something this big and with so many options and versatility.\u201d", "description": "A 173 year-old apothecary, which still contains the original display cabinets, bookcases, and medicine bottles, is expected to set a new price record for Semaphore when it heads to auction this month.", "authors": ["Lydia Kellner"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/05213054/capi_9daa212fbbcc901eb58ed11af30858eb_7f03c7c95a0b5b1b839da1f98a634d4d.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
