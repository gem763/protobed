Bill Belichick might torment you for years to come.", "language": "en", "text": "That\u2019s because Bill Belichick, in the midst of orchestrating a remarkably dominant defense, is once again proving that he\u2019s the league\u2019s reigning mastermind, even at age 67. And while his age might provide hope, at least among some, that he\u2019s not long for the sidelines, Belichick has a message: Don\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nIn an appearance Monday on Boston sports-radio station WEEI, Belichick was reminded of a comment he made in 2009, when he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like [former Bills coach] Marv Levy and coaching when I\u2019m in my 70s. You don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAsked if he was joking when he said that, Belichick replied, \u201cYou know, when I said it, maybe I didn\u2019t know what 70 felt like, so I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s an accurate statement today or not.\"\n\n\u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t feel that way,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that I\u2019m closer to that age, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOkay, so that\u2019s far from a declaration that Belichick will be around to torment Pats-haters for years to come. However, coming from the notoriously taciturn coach, who would rather swear off cut-up hoodies than provide insight into his thinking, it\u2019s a fairly strong hint that he doesn\u2019t feel a need to hang up the headset anytime soon.\n\nIn addition, age might be nothing but a number, but his win total after Sunday\u2019s swatting of the Browns is a heck of a number: 300. That makes Belichick just the third NFL coach to attain that mark, after Don Shula (347) and George Halas (324).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019ll take some doing to reach Shula, but who would bet against Belichick at this point? Given that his 8-0 Patriots are threatening to go undefeated again (at least until the Super Bowl), they appear to be a lock for their 17th straight season with double-digit wins, and their 19th with nine-plus.\n\nThat\u2019s an absolutely ridiculous streak, and it\u2019s among the many reasons \u2014 six Super Bowl wins would be another good one \u2014 to consider Belichick the greatest football coach of all time. He\u2019s also been described as a \u201cwalking encyclopedia of the history of the NFL,\u201d so there\u2019s a decent chance that etching his name further into league annals by climbing atop its victories list has some appeal.\n\nHey, if nothing else, Belichick needs a challenge at this point, right? If we conservatively give him five more wins this season, and an average of 10 wins per season going forward, he\u2019d need to be coaching at least until he\u2019s 72.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting number in its own right, because it just so happens to be the ages of Halas and Levy, the oldest coaches in NFL history, in their final seasons. In other words, if Belichick goes for that record and coaches until he\u2019s 73, he would then be an excellent bet to top Shula along the way.\n\nOf course, this is all conjecture, and Belichick could just as easily retire this offseason, particularly if the 42-year-old Brady does the same. However, getting back to Belichick possibly looking for his next challenge, it\u2019s not crazy to think that he might want to prove he can win big without Brady.\n\nThe fact that Belichick recently groomed two more quality NFL quarterbacks in Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett, now with the 49ers and Colts, respectively, indicates that he might be capable of just such a feat in New England. Then there\u2019s this quote, delivered shortly before the Patriots won the Super Bowl earlier this year:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have a good setup here,\u201d Belichick said (via CBS Sports). \u201c[Owner Robert Kraft] has been very supportive, gives us a great opportunity to go out and compete every week. We\u2019ve done that. Hope we can continue it for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cContinue it for a long time,\u201d eh? That sounds pretty ominous for everyone hoping to avoid a third decade of Patriots dominance.\n\nHeck, at the rate things are going, we all might be in our 70s before New England stops ruling the NFL universe.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "New England's mastermind said a decade ago that he wouldn't coach into his 70s, but a day after getting win No. 300, the 67-year-old was singing a slightly different tune.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eh-H0Cj3jArCGXUI2t-ugxTwOSw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F5PEMNHZY4I6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
