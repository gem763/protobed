She began her entertainment career as an actress at age 10 and had a long documented history of depression and mental health struggles.\n\nSulli\u2019s suicide follows the failed suicide attempt of Goo Ha-ra, a former member of the K-pop girl group Kara, in May and the suicide of Kim Jong-hyun, vocalist for the boy group SHINee, in 2017. Goo apologized profusely to her fans after surviving her suicide attempt and has faced, like most young Korean entertainers online, abuse for years.\n\nOther Korean pop stars have faced a host of allegations of improprieties and concerning behavior, most prominently Seungri, a former member of one of Korea\u2019s most popular groups, Big Bang, who is currently facing charges of having arranged prostitution services at a night club in which he had ownership.\n\nMultiple reports documenting the K-pop industry since it became an international sensation in the late 2000s and early 2010s document grueling lifestyles for the children who grow up into the pop industry, many tethered to over-decade-long contracts that control nearly every aspect of their lives. The children study and practice singing and dancing skills for long days at training camps before being launched into \u201cidol\u201d superstardom.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child designates an obligation to state parties to \u201ctake all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.\u201d South Korea ratified the convention in 1991.\n\nAccording to South Korea\u2019s JoongAng Ilbo, Sulli\u2019s brother, who also managed her career, found her body in her home on Monday afternoon local time. On Tuesday, police revealed they had found what appeared to be a suicide note; authorities did not provide the text of the note, noting only that she stated in it that she was \u201csuffering\u201d and left \u201cnegative messages.\u201d Her brother confirmed that Sulli had endured \u201csevere depression\u201d for years. Police have not identified a cause of death.\n\nA lifetime in the spotlight had apparently contributed to her depression. She began her career as a ten-year-old actress in a Korean soap opera before joining F(x) at age 15, meaning she did not participate in the customary K-pop \u201cboot camp\u201d childhood that many others do before joining a group.\n\nThe Jakarta Post noted that, upon her departure from the group in 2015, she said that she \u201cdid not know why I had to do certain things,\u201d apparently alluding to her entertainment career, and that \u201cat some point, I realized [that this was not fit for me].\u201d\n\nSulli reportedly faced severe online verbal abuse for attempting a bolder personality upon leaving the girl group, dating men older than her and taking photos while not wearing a bra. Much of the criticism against her would target her feminist stances and seemingly liberal (for Korea) personal lifestyle.\n\nFollowing her suicide, Korean outlets revealed, citing anonymous sourcing within the industry, that Sulli had demanded her record label take legal action against online bullies.\n\nSulli and F(x) had a contract with SM Entertainment, one of the largest record labels in the country. SM reportedly did attempt to take action, but was unable to identify many of the individuals using anonymous accounts to post online.\n\nOnline accounts began posting antagonistic messages on the social media accounts of Choiza, a rapper who dated Sulli in 2014, following her death, blaming him for her suicide and asking him to \u201cdie.\u201d Some responded criticizing the vitriol, and some celebrities posting tributes to Sulli used the opportunity to condemn the pressure placed on young performers.\n\nGoo Ha-ra, who survived her own suicide attempt in May, left a tribute message on Instagram for Sulli, who was a friend. Goo similarly received online vitriol amid a dispute with an ex-boyfriend she accused of attempting to use revenge porn against her. Goo wrote \u201cgoodbye\u201d on Instagram before she was found barely clinging to life in her apartment and revived. Her handlers denied a similar scenario in September 2018, claiming she suffered an illness and not a suicide attempt.\n\nIn response to antagonism online, Goo apologized upon resurfacing following her suicide attempt.\n\n\u201cI am sorry for causing concerns and a commotion \u2026 I had been in agony over a number of overlapping issues. But from now on, I will steel my heart and try to show up healthy,\u201d Goo said in a statement. \u201cI will show a brighter and healthier side of myself.\u201d\n\nJonghyun, the pop group SHINee member who committed suicide in 2017, left a note explicitly blaming his entertainment career for his death.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my path to become world-famous. Why did I choose this path? It\u2019s quite funny now that I think about it. It\u2018s a miracle that I endured through it all this time,\u201d his alleged suicide letter read. \u201cIt is easy to say \u2018I\u2018m going to end it.\u2019 It is very difficult to actually go through with it. I\u2019ve been struggling through the difficulty.\u201d\n\nThe path to K-pop superstardom is often littered with what the BBC has referred to as \u201cslave contracts,\u201d which keep stars bound to record labels for a decade or more on occasion and require intense training throughout childhood. The training often keeps the children from a normal life at school and separates them from parents and other related adults who can supervise their development. Artists have complained that the contracts also deny them a significant chunk of the profits of their work.\n\n\u201cBehind the bubbly bling and superficial glamour of their glossy photographs, formulaic song-and-dance routines and insipid TV melodramas, the reality is a depressingly dystopian existence,\u201d Yonden Lhatoo, a columnist for the South China Morning Post, lamented of Korean entertainment in 2017. \u201cMany are literally owned \u2013 mind, body and soul \u2013 by their unscrupulous and abusive agents and studio bosses who project them as role models for youth while treating them as slaves and sex dolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould-be K-pop stars, while still underage, are regularly locked into unbelievably unfair contracts and incarcerated in gruelling boot camps for training, a good decade before they get to even record a song, let alone become famous,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe ones who are lucky enough to make it end up paying off debts and earning a pittance for years.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "South Korean police ruled the death of 25-year-old Choi Jin-ri, known by her stage name Sulli, a suicide on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-488300416-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
