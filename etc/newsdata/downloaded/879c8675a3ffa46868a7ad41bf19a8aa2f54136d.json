He just brought us back down to earth, and told us, 'You have to play well first, and everything else will come'.\n\n\"It's awesome to see it come together. It will mean a lot for us to go all the way as a team.\"\n\nFlanker Francois Louw added: \"He had a challenge... to align the players on a specific plan.\n\n\"So far so good, we'll see on Saturday whether it's worked.\"", "description": "Rassie Erasmus has led South Africa from the depths of despair to the Rugby World Cup final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7906/159496f56e6d4eac8a5ae2ed78918fc3.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
