Jared Polis said in March that Colorado would no longer ask for an exemption from EPA standards by claiming some of the pollution was drifting into the state from elsewhere.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop \u201csugar-coating\u201d Colorado\u2019s air problems, he said last month. \u201cMoving to \u2018serious\u2019 status finally helps us stop sweeping our air quality crisis under the rug and gives us additional tools to move urgently to make our air cleaner,\u201d he said.\n\nBut business groups say the state\u2019s own data shows Colorado would meet EPA standards if not for pollution from other states and even other continents. Lowering the air rating would hurt the economy by increasing the cost of doing business, they say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about tens of millions of dollars in direct and indirect costs,\u201d said Paul Seby, an attorney representing Defend Colorado, which advocates for business and industry on state and federal regulation.\n\nDenver and the northern Colorado urban corridor have struggled to meet EPA ozone standards for 15 years. Ground-level ozone can aggravate asthma and contribute to early deaths from respiratory disease. It\u2019s the main component of smog, and it\u2019s created from pollution emitted by vehicles, industries, solvents and other sources.\n\nClean-air advocates welcomed Polis\u2019 decision to pull the state\u2019s request for an exemption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Christine Berg, Colorado field consultant for Moms Clean Air Force. \u201cWe know ozone pollution is particularly harmful for children.\u201d\n\nBut Seby said Polis\u2019 decision was based on politics, not facts.\n\nPolis\u2019 predecessor, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper - who ended his presidential bid last month and is now running for the U.S. Senate - had asked for the exemption based on data showing that pollution elsewhere and forest fire smoke from other states had pushed Colorado over the limit, Seby said.\n\n\u201cGov. Polis came into office and the exact opposite came about,\u201d Seby said. \u201cThe data didn\u2019t change, the science didn\u2019t change - except for the politics.\u201d\n\nSeby said hundreds of businesses and institutions could be affected if Colorado\u2019s air rating is downgraded: oil and gas drilling, refineries, large breweries, print shops, wastewater treatment plants and hospitals.\n\nAnna Unruh, an air quality consultant for Trinity Consultants, which helps businesses get environmental permits and comply with regulations, agreed that a lower rating would complicate life for businesses and industry.\n\nGetting permits could take longer, she said. Expansion projects that might not have needed permits before would be required to get them now. More businesses would have to devote employee time to monitoring and reporting on their pollution.\n\n\u201cPermitting definitely will get more difficult,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to Denver, counties affected by the change are Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Douglas, Jefferson, Larimer and Weld.\n\n___\n\nFollow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Colorado took the unusual step of inviting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to downgrade the air quality rating of the state's biggest population center, and not everyone thinks that was a good idea.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Elliott"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/air_pollution_colorado_16496_c0-309-6767-4254_s1770x1032.jpg?0993798324f3ebd3fa245f32f42d77761068dd6e", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
