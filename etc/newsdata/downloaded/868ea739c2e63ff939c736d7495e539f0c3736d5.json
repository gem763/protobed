However, the jury rejected his story and convicted him of all three charges.\n\nDuring his trial, the prosecution told how Vernon had \"intentionally inflicted non-accidental injuries on his son\", resulting in a fractured skull and the bleed on the brain.\n\nMcKenzie was taken to the QEQM Hospital in Margate, last July 23 after collapsing at his home in Broadstairs, Kent.\n\nHe was transferred to Kings College Hospital in London but never recovered and died three days later, aged just 47 days old.\n\nThe UK's only forensic bone expert, Professor David Mangham, says he believes they were caused deliberately.\n\nEarlier in the trial prosecutor Steven Perian QC said: \"These injuries included a skull fracture and a broken blood vessel, close to the internal corner of the left eye.\n\n(Image: Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n\"There were a number of skeletal fractures found, fractures to the left collarbone, the left ankle and right thigh bone as well as 11 rib fractures.\"\n\n\"The expert medical opinion is that the fatal head injury caused McKenzie's death but it had occurred in the context of multiple rib fractures and fractures to the left ankle region.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said that some of the injuries the baby had suffered happened between one and three weeks before his death.\n\nHe added: \"We say that the fatal injury to McKenzie was caused by shaking the child with a firm grip to the chest causing rib fractures.\n\n\"We also suggest that there had been forcible twisting and pulling of the lower limbs.\"\n\nThe court heard how Vernon had gone online to search 'I grabbed my baby too hard, now has bruises' and 'Have you ever accidentally hurt your child when they are having a meltdown.'\n\nWhen McKenzie needed to go to hospital, Vernon didn't join his partner and son but instead went to a BMX and skateboarding show instead.\n\nHe later confessed this was to avoid questions about the injuries.\n\nVernon will be sentenced next month when McKenzie's mother is set to personally read to the court her statement about the impact of her baby's death.", "description": "\"Manipulative liar\" Lee Vernon, 21, left little McKenzie Ellis, from Broadstairs, Kent, with dozens of injuries including a skull fracture", "authors": ["William Janes", "Paul Hooper", "Image", "Kent Police", "Alamy Stock Photo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715640.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Dad-murdered-his-own-baby-boy-by-shaking-him-so-hard-the-six-week-old-suffered-28-broken-bones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
