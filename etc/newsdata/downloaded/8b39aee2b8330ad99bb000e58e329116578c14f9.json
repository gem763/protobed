Jonas is set to join the singing competition in spring 2020. USA TODAY\n\n\"The Voice\" contestants are coming out swinging!\n\nMonday marked the third night of Battles on the NBC show, and as the coaches use up their steals and saves, the pressure on singers to deliver a knockout punch intensifies.\n\nIn fact, \"this is the first season we are allowed to save in the Battles,\" Kelly Clarkson said. \"When you have that opportunity to actually save someone to stick around, it\u2019s so magical.\"\n\nBlake Shelton had a strategy going into his team's first head-to-head between Marina Chello and Ricky Duran, a four-chair turn.\n\n\"My goal is to have the least amount of people go home, even if they go to suckier coaches,\" he said. \"There\u2019s no reason any of you two should be going home.\"\n\nLast week on 'The Voice':Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani break up over this (double) steal-worthy duet\n\nChello and Duran blew the judges away with their powerful rendition of the Zutons' \"Valerie.\" Shelton picked Duran, but had a trick up his sleeve.

But his confidence was shaken when girlfriend Gwen Stefani couldn't keep her eyes off another man.\n\nTeam Legend's Will Breman and Jared Herzog took on Shawn Mendes' \"Treat You Better.\" The duo sparred in the ring with their vocals, dance moves and personalities, leaving Stefani wondering if Breman could treat her better than Shelton.\n\n\"Will, I can not keep my eyes off of you. I could not stop staring,\" Stefani told Breman. Shelton interjected, \"Hey, hey, hey, hey,\" while John Legend added, \"He's right here!\"\n\nStefani wasn't the only coach hot and bothered by the pair of heartthrobs. Clarkson called their harmony \"crazy sexy.\" Shelton added, \"I also find you both very sexy.\"\n\n\"These ladies are loving you guys. It\u2019s hot in here,\" Legend said while fanning himself. In the end, he picked Breman's \"infectious\" personality and star power.\n\nStefani still couldn't help herself. \"I\u2019m obsessed with him,\" she added.\n\nJared and Will\u2026 I couldn\u2019t be more proud to have you on #TeamJohn! Great work by both of you! #VoiceBattles \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) October 22, 2019\n\nThe \"No Doubt\" rocker got a run for her money later in the night when Legend attempted to steal James Violet from her after Kyndal Inskeep won the duo's performance of Maren Morris' \"I Could Use a Love Song.\"\n\n\"I got to be honest, I had this planned this whole time. You were always on my 'I\u2019m going to save him' list,\" Stefani told Violet after using her save on him. \"I'm, like, so terrified that you are going to go with John. It\u2019s awful, how dare you!\"\n\nKyndal Inskeep: Gwen Stefani delivers epic block on boyfriend Blake Shelton\n\n\"She was ready to toss you (out),\" Legend said, adding, \"I really heard the magic in your voice and I don\u2019t have anyone on my team like you.\"\n\nViolet's choice?
