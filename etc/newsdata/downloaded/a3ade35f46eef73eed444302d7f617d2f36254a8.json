Two occurred in Brooks County, about 80 miles from the border.\n\nMission Police Department officers notified Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents about the discovery on Monday of a deceased migrant in a canal. McAllen Station agents responded to the scene and found the body of a Mexican national who apparently drowned after illegally crossing, according to Rio Grande Valley Sector officials. A local justice of the peace made the statutory declaration and agents arranged for transportation of the body to the Hidalgo County Morgue.\n\nLater that day, Brooks County Sheriff\u2019s Office dispatchers received information about the discovery of skeletal remains on a ranch located about 80 miles inland. The Border Patrol operates an immigration checkpoint in the middle of the county on U.S. Highway 285. Human smugglers frequently force migrants to march around the checkpoint and pick up the ones who successfully complete the trek north of the checkpoint.\n\nDispatchers sent a deputy to meet Border Patrol agents at the ranch where they found the skeletal remains of a migrant who died after being abandoned. Local officials gathered the remains and arranged transportation to the Webb County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office for possible identification and return to the migrant\u2019s family.\n\nTwo days earlier, Kingsville Station Border Patrol agents tracking a group of migrants on a ranch near U.S. Highway 285 discovered another set of remains in the same county. The deputies contacted the sheriff\u2019s office to arrange recovery.\n\nDispatchers sent Deputy Robert Castanon to the ranch to meet Border Patrol agents at the scene of the migrant\u2019s death. There, Castanon observed a skull and \u201cother unidentified skeletal remains,\u201d according to information provided by the Brooks County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nA local justice of the peace made the statutory death pronouncement and the deputy turned the remains over to a representative of the Texas State University Anthropology Department.\n\nSo far this year, 40 migrants died while being smuggled through this single Texas county, Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas. Deaths of migrants in Brooks County account for nearly 12 percent of all migrant deaths along the entire southwest border with Mexico.\n\nThis year, at least 340 migrants died while or shortly after illegally crossing the border from Mexico, according to the International Organization for Migration\u2019s Missing Migrant Project. At least 214 of those deaths occurred in Texas \u2014 approximately 90 in the Rio Grande Valley Sector.\n\nActing CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters in El Paso on Tuesday, that Congress must act to close the loopholes that are attracting the massive number of migrants who illegally crossed the border this year.\n\n\u201cThe families that are coming, and the kids, they\u2019re being abused,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThese cartels and human smuggling organizations, they\u2019re not even dealing with these individuals as humans. They\u2019re dealing with them as a commodity. It\u2019s disgusting and that should bother us all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis population that\u2019s looking for a better life is being abused every single day by these cartels \u2014 getting rich on their backs,\u201d the commissioner expressed. \u201cWe should all want to stop that.\u201d", "description": "Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement recovered the remains of three migrants who died near the Texas border with Mexico.", "authors": ["Bob Price"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Brooks-County-Body-40-October-2019-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
