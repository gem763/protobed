Some celebs have urged TV and film companies to abandon the state after Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed the restrictive abortion bill in May.\n\nBut Perry, whose hits include the \u201cMadea\u201d franchise and \u201cWhy Did I Get Married\u201d films, said he is committed to staying put.\n\n\u201cAtlanta has been the dream. It has been the promised land,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I got here, this whole state and city has been amazing to me and I wouldn\u2019t trade that for anything. Also, I put $250 million in the ground here and in the studio. So when you have a quarter of a billion dollars sat down in the ground, you can\u2019t just up and leave.\u201d\n\nPerry is planning a star-studded unveiling of his new studio complex next weekend.\n\nThe law bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can happen as early as six weeks into pregnancy before many women realize they\u2019re expecting. The law is set to become enforceable Jan. 1.\n\nSome actors and actresses such as Alyssa Milano, Mark Hamill and Mandy Moore have suggested a boycott against filming in Georgia. Others, like Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams are proceeding to shoot their HBO show \u201cLovecraft County,\u201d but said they will donate all of their \u201cepisodic fees\u201d to organizations fighting the law including the ACLU of Georgia and Fair Fight Georgia.\n\nPerry hasn\u2019t been vocal about his views on the law, but the filmmaker later told The AP he is against the law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe any man should be able to tell a woman what she can do with her body or reproductive organs,\u201d he said.\n\nPerry said the workers who helped Georgia\u2019s thriving television and film industry could have an impact in the 2022 governor\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cWhat I know about this industry is that there are 94,000-plus or 98,000 people who are in this industry and who are benefiting from it greatly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a lot of votes. I\u2019m in a wait and see moment right now. But that\u2019s a lot of votes. That\u2019s a lot of votes that can determine an election.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Jonathan Landrum Jr. on Twitter: http://twitter.com/MrLandrum31\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tyler Perry said he cannot \"just up and leave\" filming in Georgia despite Hollywood's backlash against the state's \"heartbeat\" abortion law.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jonathan Landrum Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/people_tyler_perry_82182_c0-263-3512-2310_s1770x1032.jpg?f334c3089eb88512a6936ba13b0ac299b43446a6", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
