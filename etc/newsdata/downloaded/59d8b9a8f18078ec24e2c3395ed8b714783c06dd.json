It\u2019s very hard to see how the state of the union in its current form survives Brexit.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf we\u2019re going into a general election in which further polarisation is a deliberate aim of the campaigning of at least some of the political parties, you do wonder in all seriousness where all of this ends.\u201d\n\nOf the 4,103 politically representative respondents, a significant number \u2013 47% in Wales, 52% in England and 61% in Scotland \u2013 thought that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU would likely lead to the breakup of the UK.\n\nMany were also willing to see the union change substantially if it meant they would get their own way on Brexit. Among leave voters, 74% in England, the same percentage in Wales and 59% in Scotland believed the breakup of the UK would be worth it to take back control through delivering Brexit.\n\nSimilar proportions of remainers believed undermining faith in the union would be a price worth paying in order to remain in the EU.\n\nAilsa Henderson, a professor of political science at the University of Edinburgh and fellow co-director of the research, said the findings showed that Brexit negotiations were \u201cputting the union under considerable strain regardless of whether we stay or go\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cBoth sides are prepared to fundamentally rewrite the rules of politics as we know it to get what they want. Staying in the EU will likely decrease faith in the union. Brexit could well change its borders.\u201d\n\nDespite leave voters\u2019 conviction that Brexit should be delivered at all costs, over half of people throughout all three countries thought that the nation would become substantially poorer as a result of Brexit.\n\nHowever, a huge number of those who voted leave in the EU referendum believed that economic losses would be worth it \u2013 76% in England and Scotland and 81% in Wales.\n\nSimilarly, voters overwhelmingly felt that the potential destruction of the country\u2019s farming and fishing industries would be a price worth paying for getting the result they wanted in the Brexit negotiations.", "description": "Research finds majority of both leave and remain voters feel violence worth it to get outcome they support", "authors": ["Amy Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8441329cb025e8213d6febe76f8f7f447e0c4a9/133_296_2581_1549/master/2581.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75ca1943e012e73d6fdfdb6562bf7cff", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
