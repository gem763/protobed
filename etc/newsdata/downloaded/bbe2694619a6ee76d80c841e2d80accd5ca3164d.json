In the 2019 financial year, Qantas Loyalty's underlying earnings were $374 million.\n\nAs with all of the company's similar ventures, Qantas has attached its car insurance product to its loyalty division and its robust Frequent Flyer program.\n\nBoasting 12 million members as of June, Qantas Frequent Flyer allows customers to earn points and redeem them in exchange for cheaper flights.\n\nThe program's members will gain 20,000 new points when they first sign-up to the car insurance product and have the opportunity to earn 6000 more by completing activities specified in the Qantas Wellbeing App.\n\nHowever, the influx of new points is almost certain to impact the airline's balance sheet due to their reportage as liabilities. In the last five years alone, Qantas' total liabilities have increased by almost $1.9 billion due in part to unused frequent flyer points.\n\nMr Joyce said the company remained focused on encouraging more use of the points to manage this problem after it relaunched the loyalty program earlier in the year.\n\n\"We've made a million more seats available to encourage people to use the points,\" he said. \"So we've actually seen redemption since that really pull up by 30 per cent.\"\n\nYet, Mr Joyce conceded the company may have to do more to alleviate the balance sheet pressure.\n\n\"We do need to find ways of getting people to redeem them more,\" he said.", "description": "Qantas has thrown its hat further into the insurance sector announcing car insurance products that are looped in with its frequent flyer loyalty scheme that chief executive Alan Joyce said would double the scheme's earnings over the next decade.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1886%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_63/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a97c4db06562ea53f901471c2d9793f62bf3e0de", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
