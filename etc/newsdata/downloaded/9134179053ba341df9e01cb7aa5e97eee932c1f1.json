REUTERS/Tingshu Wang\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s pork imports in September surged 76% from a year earlier while beef imports came close to a monthly record, as it stocked up on proteins after disease decimated its huge hog herd, customs data showed on Monday.\n\nPork imports CNC-PORK-IMP for the first eight months of the year were 1.33 million tonnes, up 43.6% from the same period a year earlier, said the General Administration of Customs in a statement.\n\nThat brought September arrivals to 166,000 tonnes, according to Reuters calculations, and slightly ahead of last month\u2019s 163,000 tonnes.\n\nThe deadly African swine fever has reduced the world\u2019s top pig herd by almost 40%, according to official data, after spreading unchecked throughout the country and leaving many farmers unwilling to replenish their farms.\n\nThe slump in the herd has pushed retail pork prices up by 84% year-on-year to 43.4 yuan ($6.14) per kg while the country\u2019s food price index is at its highest since January 2012.\n\nImports of beef, usually more expensive than pork, also seem to be benefiting from the meat shortage, with Reuters calculations putting September arrivals at 149,666 tonnes.\n\nThat\u2019s up 50% on a year ago, and just shy of the record monthly volume of 152,213 tonnes in July this year.
