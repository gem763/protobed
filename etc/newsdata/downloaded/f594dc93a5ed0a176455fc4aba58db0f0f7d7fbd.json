(Powell Jobs is the founder of Emerson Collective, which is the majority owner of The Atlantic.)\n\nIger, who has considered running for president, said that as his employees\u2019 trust in government wanes, they\u2019ve turned to Disney to take action on social and political issues. \u201cBecause they feel that they\u2019ve been failed by other entities, they\u2019re expecting their company to step up,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe rightfully so.\u201d\n\nDisney isn\u2019t the only company to face this kind of pressure from its employees. As my colleague Ellen Cushing has written, workers at Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, and Amazon have all pressured their employers\u2014in the past year alone\u2014to reconsider government contracts that employees viewed to be unethical.\n\nLast year, Disney committed to paying for its U.S. hourly employees\u2019 education, a benefit Iger said almost 9,000 workers had already cashed in on. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anything we\u2019ve done that has resonated more than this,\u201d he said. Also in 2018, Disney struck a deal with unions representing workers at its parks in Orlando, Florida, and Anaheim, California, to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2021, though its merger with 21st Century Fox earlier this year is expected to result in thousands of layoffs. Iger, meanwhile, was the third-best-paid CEO of a public company in 2018, making more than Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Softbank\u2019s Nikesh Arora.", "description": "People expect companies to step up because other institutions are failing them, Bob Iger said at The Atlantic Festival.", "authors": ["Rachel Gutman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/BiDTfxq7/facebook.jpg?1569443702", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
