SMILE is optional.\n\n'For those Barefoot Investor fans, SMILE = splurge on small things to make you smile, DREAM = save for something you dream about getting, LOVE = give to others, share the love,' she said of the three sections.\n\nShe went on to say that she has a jar 'filled with paddle pop sticks with different household jobs' at home.\n\nTypical chores include emptying the dishwasher, watering the plants, filling the dog's water bowl and taking out the recycling.\n\nThis is how her son earns his pocket money, and each task is worth 50 cents.\n\nThe mum motivates her son (stock image) to save by telling him, if he manages to accumulate more than $30 in his DREAM account, he will earn 10 per cent interest on it through her\n\n'At the end of each week, we add the sticks up and he gets his pocket money,' the woman said.\n\n'The more he helps, the more he earns. It's up to him!,' she added.\n\nTo work out how the SMILE, DREAM and LOVE sections of the box work, the woman said she has established some ground rules.\n\n'The rules are: He must put some of his dollars into DREAM and LOVE. However, SMILE is optional.\n\n'The choice is his and the amount is up to him,' she said.\n\nShe motivates him to save by telling him, if he manages to accumulate more than $30 in his DREAM account, he will earn 10 per cent interest on it through her.\n\n'He can decide to share his LOVE in the form of a charity donation or to buy a gift for someone else to make their day,' she concluded.\n\nThe post clearly resonated with other parents, who said they thought it was a genius idea for young kids.\n\n'What an awesome and beautiful thing to teach your son,' one mother posted.\n\n'Absolutely love the idea that the earning potential is up to your son,' another added.\n\n'We have been struggling for an effective way to get our six year old to help without us constantly nagging. Hope you don't mind, I'm stealing this idea.'\n\nWhat are the Barefoot Investor's nine steps? The Barefoot Investor series, written by Scott Pape, is a nine-step guide to financial freedom (pictured) 1. Schedule a monthly Barefoot Date night to catch up on where you are financially. 2. Set up your three buckets for housing your income each pay check. 3. Get rid of your debts. 4. Buy your home. 5. Increase your super to 15 per cent. 6. Increase your mojo bucket to allow for three months of living expenses, in case of an emergency. 7. Get the bankers off your back by lowering your interest rate and making extra repayments. 8. Nail your retirement number so you're never out of money. 9. Leave a legacy behind.\n\nOthers praised the mum for teaching 'compassion' to her son.\n\nThe Barefoot Investor series, written by Scott Pape, is a nine-step guide to financial freedom.\n\nOne of its most popular take-home messages is the 'bucket theory' of learning.\n\nIt involves taking your income and separating it into three distinct 'buckets' of money: 'blow', 'mojo' and 'grow'.\n\nThese represent daily expenses and some treats, savings that will meet occasional out-of-pocket expenses, and untouchable funds to put toward long-term life goals.", "description": "An Australian mother has revealed how she is teaching her eight-year-old son to live like the famous Gen Y finance guru, the Barefoot Investor.
