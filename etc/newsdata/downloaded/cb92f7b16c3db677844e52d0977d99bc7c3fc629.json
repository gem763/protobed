As one of Italy\u2019s 20 official regions, Molise has a status equal to Tuscany, Lombardy or Piedmont. It holds regional elections and votes in national ones. It borders the regions of Abruzzo, Puglia, Lazio and Campania, all indisputably real places. So why do Italians like to pretend that Molise doesn\u2019t exist?\n\n\u201cI first came across it on the internet several years ago,\u201d said Enzo Luongo, a journalist and author of the book Il Molise Non Esiste (Molise Doesn\u2019t Exist). \u201cPeople had started posting the hashtag #ilmolisenonesiste as a joke, making fun of the region\u2019s small size as well as our relative obscurity within Italy.\u201d\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 A tiny republic of free spirits\n\n\u2022 Germany\u2019s tiny geographic oddity\n\n\u2022 Europe\u2019s strange border anomaly\n\nHowever, what surprised Luongo was the creativity of the comments that the hashtag inspired, which ranged from the amusing (\u201cI wrote \u2018Molise does not exist\u2019 as my Facebook status. My geography teacher liked it.\u201d) to the downright absurd (\u201cI met a guy from Molise who was doing his Erasmus year in Italy.\u201d). It seemed that the region, hitherto ignored, had suddenly awakened a latent creativity within Italians.\n\nOf course we exist!\n\nThe \u201cMolise conspiracy\u201d, as it has come to be known, has gone on to become something of a cultural phenomenon within Italy, spawning books, songs, videos, theatrical monologues, news articles and more. It has been referenced by everyone from comedian Beppe Grillo to former prime minister Matteo Renzi. A popular Facebook page called Molisn\u2019t \u2013 lo non credo nell\u2019esistenza del Molise (Molisn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t believe in the existence of Molise) revels in the conspiracy, selling \u201cMolisn\u2019t\u201d merchandise such as T-shirts and mugs. Mock scientific papers have been published speculating on the region\u2019s existence, while internet memes compare Molise to Narnia and portray maps of Italy with a black hole where the region should be. A YouTube video from 2015 \u2013 dramatically titled IL MOLISE NON ESISTE!! \u2013 has more than 1.6 million views, more than five times the 305,000-strong population of Molise itself.\n\nWithin a few short years, the region of Molise had gone from obscurity to become, arguably, Italy\u2019s national joke.\n\nMy train rolled into the resort town of Termoli on Molise\u2019s 35km stretch of coastline. The picturesque fishing town sits on a walled promontory peering out over the Adriatic Sea, and is watched over by a formidable 11th-Century castle. For most, Termoli\u2019s main draw is its long sandy beach and its trabucchi, traditional fishing huts that sit on stilts above the water. The town is also home to A Rejecelle \u2013 Italy\u2019s narrowest street \u2013 which at 34cm wide I was only able to pass through by turning sideways and sucking in my gut.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, when I would tell other Italians that I was from Molise, they would give me a blank expression. They literally had never heard of us,\u201d said local guide Maria Laura Pace when I met her in Termoli\u2019s main square. \u201cNow when I mention Molise to them, they laugh and say Molise doesn\u2019t exist. In a way, that\u2019s progress.\u201d\n\nSo how does it feel to be told you don\u2019t exist, I asked?\n\n\u201cPeople here were slightly bemused at first, but now I think we\u2019ve come to embrace the absurdity of it all,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI mean, of course we exist!\u201d\n\nThroughout Italy\u2019s history, Molise has always been on the outskirts. In ancient times, the region was home to the Samnites, a mysterious tribe that fought numerous battles with the Romans before being subjugated in the 3rd Century BC. Poor and mountainous, it was largely ignored by the Romans and again by the Lombards, Normans, Bourbons and others who passed through. A peripheral area of the new Kingdom of Italy in 1861, it became part of the Abruzzo e Molise region created after World War Two, but split off from Abruzzo in 1963 to become Italy\u2019s youngest \u2013 and least known \u2013 region.\n\nThe reasons for Molise\u2019s separation from Abruzzo are fairly arcane, and many residents will argue that perhaps the split was a mistake and that they should reunite with Abruzzo, with which they share strong cultural ties. Others, like Pace, are fiercely proud of their region. A few years ago, she returned from living abroad to help found Moleasy, a network of enterprising molisani looking to jumpstart tourism in the region.\n\nIn a way, we are Italy\u2019s last great unknown\n\n\u201cWe want to share our love of our native region,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe have mountains and sea, incredible old villages, ancient festivals, delicious food \u2013 all within a tiny geographical area. Unlike most other parts of Italy, here you can still find life as it used to be, unchanged for centuries.\u201d\n\nMoleasy has focused on the development of slow tourism \u2013 scattered hotels, food tours, farm stays, cultural visits. \u201cWe are trying to attract people who have already been to Rome, Venice, Florence, etcetera, and are looking for something completely off the tourist map,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a way, we are Italy\u2019s last great unknown.\u201d\n\nPace sees the \u201cMolise doesn\u2019t exist\u201d phenomenon as an opportunity to give the region a unique brand. \u201cWe are never going to be Tuscany, but then we don\u2019t want to be Tuscany. We want to be Molise,\u201d she said.\n\nWe wandered into Termoli\u2019s main cathedral. The elegant Romanesque building was constructed in the 12th and 13th Centuries and survived the town\u2019s sacking by Ottoman pirates in the mid-1500s. Today it\u2019s a popular spot for weddings and concerts.\n\n\u201cInside this church lie the relics of St Timothy, the early Christian evangelist who travelled with St Paul and is addressed to in the New Testament,\u201d Pace whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that our small region holds such important artefacts. If this were anywhere else, it would be the main tourist attraction. If only people knew this was here...\u201d\n\nI took a bus from Termoli and headed towards Molise\u2019s interior. Climbing further into the heart of the region, I watched soft green hills give way to vast mountains, while scattered villages, with their pencil-thin bell towers and tightly huddled houses, seemed to fade away at the mountain\u2019s edge. Many of the region\u2019s villages are still connected by tratturi \u2013 ancient shepherding paths that are slowly being rediscovered as hiking trails.\n\nOne such village is Agnone, home to the Marinelli Bell Foundry. Founded in 1339, it\u2019s the oldest continuously operating bell foundry in the world, as well as being Italy\u2019s oldest family business and the official provider of bells to the Vatican. Marinelli has become something of a symbol of the Molise spirit: with no tourism to interrupt life here, tradition reigns supreme.\n\n\u201cMolise is one of the last authentic places in Italy. In fact, I would say it is a truly timeless place,\u201d said Simone Cretella, a local politician in the region.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the state has never believed that we could attract tourists. They thought that the only way to improve our development was through industry, so they built all these factories here,\u201d he added. \u201cWell now the factories are closed and all the young people are leaving again.\u201d\n\nIn a region that has historically struggled with poverty, isolation and earthquakes, the depopulation problem is ever-present \u2013 so much so that, according to The Guardian, the region\u2019s president is offering to pay people to move to Molise. Private investment in the region remains low, infrastructure is poor, and unemployment is high, forcing many younger people to leave in search of work. For some, \u201cMolise doesn\u2019t exist\u201d is less a joke, and more of a prediction about the region\u2019s future.\n\nNobody who comes to Molise leaves disappointed\n\n\u201cNobody wants to leave Molise. We have so much beauty and culture here. I feel so proud to live in a region where there is beauty everywhere,\u201d said Cretella. \u201cWhat we need is tourism. We need farm stays, hiking trails, cycle roads. We need young people to stay and develop their region through sustainable tourism. I feel that this kind of tourism could really save Molise.\u201d\n\nLike Pace, Cretella sees the \u201cMolise doesn\u2019t exist\u201d meme as an unprecedented opportunity to promote the region both at home and abroad.\n\n\u201c\u2018Molise doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 is, in a way, a perfect brand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt plays to our strengths: our mystery, our quirkiness, the fact that here is a place that is untouched by tourism. It creates that curiosity that makes people want to discover our region, and when they do, they are always so surprised at how beautiful and diverse Molise is. Nobody who comes to Molise leaves disappointed. We just need to get the message out there.\u201d\n\nCretella has spent much of his political tenure trying to convince tourism authorities to adopt a marketing strategy based on the region\u2019s supposed non-existence, but with little success. One of the downsides of living in a \u201ctimeless\u201d region, he explained, is that it\u2019s difficult to change people\u2019s mentalities.\n\nDespite this, Cretella is convinced that tourism is the future of Molise, and that the Molise conspiracy will be at the heart of that.\n\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d he said, \u201cwho wouldn\u2019t want to visit a region that doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
