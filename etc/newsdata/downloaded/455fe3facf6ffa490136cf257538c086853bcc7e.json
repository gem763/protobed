I love my Radio 1 show and covering for Claudia on Radio 2 which I\u2019ll still be doing. But I\u2019m now ready to bring a whole different show to 5 live.\n\n\u2018Expect lots of laughs and of course Chris Stark. Just what you want on a Saturday morning!\u2019\n\nAnd Chris, 32, said: \u2018Saturday mornings for me were always the excitement of a day of sport ahead and the routines that came with it.

I\u2019m excited for us to make a show that reflects the lives and stories of everyone listening on a Saturday morning. The best time of the week. We cannot wait to get started.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMills will continue to host his weekday Radio 1 show from 1pm to 4pm alongside Stark, as well as the Official Chart show.\n\nMeanwhile, Chris will also be staying put on BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s That Peter Crouch Podcast.\n\nThe lads will be replacing the regular spot left free by Danny Baker, who was sacked by the broadcaster after seemingly comparing Meghan and Harry\u2019s son Archie to a monkey.\n\nBaker shared a picture of a couple leaving a hospital, holding hands with a chimpanzee, with the caption: \u2018Royal baby leaves hospital.\u2019\n\nLaura will be on Sunday mornings (Picture: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Marie Claire)\n\nHe deleted the tweet and insisted he didn\u2019t have any racist intent, saying he wasn\u2019t aware the Duchess of Sussex is half-black, but said he understood the backlash.\n\nHowever, he isn\u2019t as understanding with the BBC, who immediately sacked him from his 5 Live Show.\n\nHe told LBC\u2019s James O\u2019Brien: \u2018I\u2019d hate to go to watch a film with these people who fired me, because they\u2019d watch the opening scene, where someone\u2019s in a locked room holding a smoking gun, there\u2019s a body on the floor and they\u2019d say, \u201cShall we go? We\u2019ve seen who\u2019s done it\u201d.\u2019\n\nBaker added: \u2018I thought it was an easy sacking for them to do.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also changes to the BBC Radio 5 Live schedule on Sundays, with Pienaar\u2019s Politics moving to 9am.\n\nLaura Whitmore will follow at 10am, with sports coverage commencing at 11.30am.\n\nHeidi Dawson, Controller at BBC Radio 5 live says: \u2018Scott Mills is one of the best broadcasters in the business and I\u2019m excited about the new show he and Chris Stark will be bringing to Saturday mornings.\n\n\u2018Laura Whitmore has done a fantastic job across a number of shows on 5 live and it\u2019s brilliant that we can now offer her a show every Sunday morning.
