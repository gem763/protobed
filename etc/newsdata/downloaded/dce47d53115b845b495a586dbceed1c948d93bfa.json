(6110.HK) got off to a strong start in its Hong Kong debut, rising nearly 12% in a reflection of investors' appetite for consumer-related stocks amid volatility in the city's stock market.\n\nShares in the distributor of brands such as Nike and Adidas opened flat on Thursday at their initial public offering price of 8.50 Hong Kong dollars (US$1.08) before surging within minutes of trading to HK$9.50.\n\nTopsports, the sportswear unit of formerly listed footwear retailer Belle International Holdings Ltd., had priced its shares near the lower end of its indicative HK$8.30-HK$10.10 range. The IPO raised HK$7.91 billion.\n\nTopsports' debut reflects that consumer-related stocks are in high demand as they offer assured growth with high price-to-earnings ratios.\n\nWhen Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC Ltd. (1876.HK) made its Hong Kong debut on Sept. 30, its shares rose as much as 6.7% from its IPO price of HK$27.00. Shares in the beer company are currently at HK$31.95.\n\nBudweiser, a unit of the world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA (ABI.BT) raised US$5 billion in its IPO, making it the biggest such offering in Hong Kong so far this year and the second-largest worldwide.\n\nAt mid-day, Topsports shares were trading up 9.4% at HK$9.30, pushing the retailer's market capitalization up to HK$57.67 billion from HK$47.93 billion at the start of trading.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and CICC advised Topsports on the IPO.\n\nWrite to Martin Mou at martin.mou@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 10, 2019 00:58 ET (04:58 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
