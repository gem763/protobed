The confirmations of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 both of which sparked controversy \u2014 solidified a 5-4 majority of justices chosen by Republican presidents. Even if Democrats take back the White House in 2020, the party is potentially looking at a decade or more before it will have a chance to tilt the court back in a liberal direction.\n\nFaced with the prospect of decades of conservative control of the high court, some liberals have floated a novel idea to regain power: adding more seats to the Supreme Court that could be filled by a Democratic president if the party takes control of the Senate in 2020.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that designates how many seats the Supreme Court should have. That decision is up to Congress. In fact, the number of justices on the high court changed six times before 1869, when Congress finally settled on nine seats.\n\nIn the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed adding seats to the Supreme Court to circumvent a judiciary that was blocking his New Deal policies. He came up short, but the threat was seen as having compelled the sitting justices to stop standing in the way of his programs. Seven of the current Democratic presidential candidates have said they\u2019re open to the idea of increasing the number of justices on the court.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nAdvocates for expanding the Supreme Court say it may be the only way to rebalance an institution that has developed a strong conservative majority through what some consider illegitimate means. A series of recent decisions \u2014 such as the rollback of the Voting Rights Act and the high court\u2019s failure to act on partisan gerrymandering \u2014 show that the court is already driven by partisanship rather than judicial prudence, some argue. \u201cWe are on the verge of a crisis of confidence in the Supreme Court,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris said.\n\nSome liberals fear that a conservative Supreme Court will block the party\u2019s progessive agenda if voters show a strong preference for Democrats in 2020. This would, in their eyes, effectively allow a handful of judges to subvert the will of the people.\n\nIncreasing the number of Supreme Court justices has, however, received strong criticism from both the left and the right. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called court-packing plans a \u201cdirect, immediate threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rights of all Americans.\u201d Many Republicans see the proposal as a desperate move by Democrats who are unable to gain power in a system that\u2019s been seen as equitable for 150 years.\n\nLiberal critics worry that if Democrats press ahead and increase the number of justices, Republicans will promptly do the same when they return to power. This could lead to a bloated, broken Supreme Court that expands whenever control of Washington changes hands.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nDemocrats need a lot of things to go right before they can be in a position to even consider expanding the high court. They\u2019d need to take the White House and Senate in 2020, as well as hold on to the House. Even then, they\u2019d likely need to eliminate the filibuster to get court-packing legislation through the Senate. Despite these long odds, it\u2019s reasonable to expect the subject to be a central issue in the 2020 election. An increasing number of voters from both parties say the court is very important to them.\n\nPerspectives\n\nPro\n\nRepublican maneuvering has undermined the legitimacy of the court\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the risk to legitimacy, to the idea of the courts as a neutral arbiter. But Trump and McConnell have already done that damage. Democrats might mitigate it, if they play hardball in return.\u201d \u2014 Jamelle Bouie, New York Times\n\nWithout expanding the court, a popular progressive agenda would be blocked\n\n\u201cEven if Democrats were to take the White House and the Senate in 2020, earning a popular mandate to revolutionize health care in America and spare the planet from human-induced heat death, a conservative Court would put every legislative effort to solve these seemingly-intractable problems in an immediate, permanent state of legal jeopardy.\u201d \u2014 Jay Willis, GQ", "description": "Faced with a conservative advantage on the Supreme Court that could last for many years, some liberals have proposed adding seats to rebalance the court if Democrats take over Congress and the White House.", "authors": ["Mike Bebernes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/98n16uq2j1pRDBoV6ge3YA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/dbc69230-de4e-11e9-b9fd-a6fce3278892", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
