Since then, Washington has gone 10-1 despite being extremely thin at the guard position and has locked up the top seed in the WNBA playoffs, which will begin for the Mystics on Tuesday with Game 1 of a best-of-five semifinal series against an opponent determined by Sunday\u2019s second-round, single-elimination matchups.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToliver has been rehabbing in hopes of returning for the playoffs at some point, though she doesn\u2019t know exactly when.\n\n\u201cMy Game 1 is whenever my Game 1 is,\u201d Toliver said Thursday in her first appearance in front of reporters since her injury. Thursday was her fifth day back on court but her first practice with the team in more than a month. The Mystics scrimmaged against their male practice squad; Toliver saw 20 minutes of half-court action and five minutes of full-court action.\n\nToliver said she hopes to contribute significantly in the postseason and that the only hurdle left is being able to practice five-on-five without too much pain afterward.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNow the biggest issue is getting used to her brace and getting her cardio, her wind back a little bit,\u201d Washington Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault said. \u201cIt\u2019s a balance between that and soreness, too.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDelle Donne and Thibault take stock as honors start to roll in\n\nFor Toliver, the journey back to the court has involved much more than keeping her upper body in shape and adjusting to her custom-made knee brace. Athletes who routinely deal with injury are accustomed to the particular physical grind of rehab, not to mention the mental toil \u2014 the lonely days when the rest of the team is on the road and you spend long, sedentary evenings trying to stave off boredom and anxiety about whether you will be the same player when you get back.\n\nIt was all new for Toliver, who remains the Mystics\u2019 third-leading scorer (13 points per game) even though she has played just 23 games. The last time she missed a game was seven years ago, when she attended her grandmother\u2019s funeral. At 32, she\u2019s the rare player who has never had a serious injury. She even tried to practice as normal the day after her injury until Elena Delle Donne, who had her own knee bone bruise a year ago, noticed her limping.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnly she could convince me to go to the training room and actually see what was up,\u201d Toliver said.\n\nAD\n\nShe was reluctant to give in and sit out, then she was reluctant to accept how long her process of recovery would be \u2014 Delle Donne has said complications relating to her bone bruise lingered because she continued to play through the injury \u2014 so Toliver turned to books on meditation to help her stay in the moment and not get ahead of herself.\n\n\u201cWhen you meditate, you\u2019re trying to be where you are. Then, of course, you\u2019re going to get distracted, but can you bring yourself back? That\u2019s like my practice,\u201d Toliver said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m sitting around and I\u2019m thinking like: \u2018God, what am I going to be like when I get back out there? Am I going to be able to defend? Am I going to be able to push the tempo? Shoot, pass, whatever?\u2019 You have to bring it back. Because you don\u2019t have control over that right now, all you can do is focus on getting better and doing your best in that process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nToliver spent every day at the Mystics\u2019 practice facility, watching practice and doing rehab around two-hour stints in a hyperbaric chamber, where she caught up on movies she never had time for before \u2014 \u201cThe Big Lebowski,\u201d \u201cGoodfellas\u201d and \u201cHarlem Nights\u201d among them.\n\nAD\n\nShe stayed engaged by activating the part of her brain that she uses during the offseason as an assistant coach with the Wizards. She watched every game she missed twice \u2014 first as a cheerleader, sitting on the bench wearing her brace and a suit, then as if she were a scout for the opposing team, texting her teammates and coaches her observations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m texting her during halftime at games when we\u2019re on the road. She\u2019s talking to me before games here, during games here, after games here. She\u2019s been really huge not only for this team but personally for me, too,\u201d starting guard Natasha Cloud said.\n\nAD\n\nIn her absence, Toliver said she has seen the team\u2019s defense improve and players such as Cloud, Ariel Atkins and Aerial Powers grow up, which she thinks only will help the Mystics during the playoffs.\n\nAD\n\nRegardless of when she returns to the court, Toliver now knows she can make an impact elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI learned that I am able to surrender to a crappy circumstance and accept things as they are and find a way to contribute even when I can\u2019t actively be on the floor,\u201d Toliver said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s always like, I want to make my teammates better \u2014 I was always out there. That\u2019s how I made them better, through my play. I had to find other ways. That\u2019s the first time I ever experienced that, and I\u2019m more valuable than just being, you know, Kristi Toliver, point guard on the floor.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWNBA playoffs: Schedule, favorites and how to watch\n\n\u2018Insane numbers\u2019: NBA stars welcome Elena Delle Donne to the 50-40-90 club\n\nSally Jenkins: I don\u2019t know what Antonio Brown did, but he\u2019s already damned by misogynist language\n\nAD", "description": "The guard and veteran leader is hopeful to return from a knee injury for the playoffs, which start for the Mystics on Tuesday, but said she has learned to \u201caccept things as they are.\"", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Sywy12nUPjsI8g6lJ54oQTJQAOQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AWI6CZUFD4I6THLT4K5GXPY3TM.jpg"}
