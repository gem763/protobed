Then hundreds of people are invited to buy tickets that cover food and entertainment for the night, and donations are collected from local businesses, sometimes in the form of raffle items or catering.\n\nThere are of course variations on those elements, but the central aim of the stag and doe\u2014beyond, of course, delivering a night of celebratory fun\u2014is to help fund a couple\u2019s upcoming nuptials: The events turn a profit off of revenues from ticket sales and pay-to-play games. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people making 15, 16, 20 thousand dollars,\u201d Reid told me while planning his own event.\n\nRead: Why is everybody getting married in a barn?\n\nReid told me that his parents and his now-wife\u2019s both had one, but none of the various experts I consulted was able to say where or when the practice originated (or even how widespread it is now).\n\nThe event, though, does have historical antecedents. Beth Montemurro, a sociology professor at Penn State University, likens them to a wedding tradition called \u201cdollar dances.\u201d In an email, she explained that wedding attendees line up \u201cto take turns to dance with the bride and she (or someone nearby) would be holding a bag for dollar donations for each person to give before their turn.\u201d Trading a modest amount of cash for a dance with the newlyweds is a practice that seems to exist, in a multitude of forms, around the world.\n\nWhen I asked Claire Stewart, the author of As Long as We Both Shall Eat: A History of Wedding Food and Feasts, about stag and does, she said they reminded her of something called a \u201cpenny wedding.\u201d Penny weddings, which date back to 16th-century Scotland, were \u201can early form of contributory celebration,\u201d she writes in her book. \u201cWedding guests often paid a small fee (a penny), brought food, or paid admission as part of attending receptions, and often the entire town, and even strangers, attended.\u201d\n\nThe revelry, which included games and prizes, could last for days, and Stewart noted that penny weddings generally were less a financial necessity than an excuse to bring the community together and have a good time. (Alas, they were banned by royal decree in 1687\u2014from then on, weddings were to be conducted with more solemnity.)\n\nThese days, the community aspect of the stag and doe is just as important as it was to penny weddings. \u201cYou can look at it like a barn raising that the Amish do,\u201d suggests Amy Alkon, an etiquette expert and the author of Good Manners for Nice People Who Sometimes Say F*ck. \u201cThis is a way\u2014in these communities\u2014that people show each other they\u2019re being generous.\u201d", "description": "At a \u201cstag and doe,\u201d communities come together to celebrate the spouses-to-be\u2014and give them a financial boost.", "authors": ["Julie Bogen"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_1174525003/facebook.jpg?1571845406", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
