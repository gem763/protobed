The First Amendment is first for a reason. Second Amendment is just in case the First one doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nThis might be the first time someone\u2019s ever spoke supportively of the right to keep and bear arms during the Kennedy Center awards, but it\u2019s not the first time Chappelle has spoken about gun ownership and gun control. In his most recent special for Netflix, the comedian riffed on buying a gun after moving to a farm in rural Ohio.\n\nChappelle says he hates guns, but he owns several. He says he doesn\u2019t want them, but he feels like he should have them, because of where he lives and the problems from the opioid epidemic. In his telling, what really prompted him to get a gun, however, was seeing a guy with a rifle strapped across his back walking through Chappelle\u2019s rural farmland. Chappelle so disliked that feeling of not being able to protect yourself that he went down to a local store (a Kmart, as Dave tells it) and bought himself a shotgun. It\u2019s entirely possible that Chappelle made up the entire story, but if he did, he didn\u2019t do it to make some sort of roundabout point in favor of gun control. I won\u2019t spoil it for you, because his special really is worth watching, but there is no \u201chaha look at the ignorant gun owners\u201d punch line to be found. The closest you\u2019ll find is his suggestion that if we really want gun control, every African American needs to buy a gun. Having said that, I assume that Chappelle, like almost every celebrity out there, supports more gun control laws, but there\u2019s no point in the Netflix special where he demands Congress reinstate a semi-auto ban or anything like that.\n\nEven though he was surrounded by a gaggle of celebrities who\u2019ve endorsed all kinds of gun control laws, Chappelle didn\u2019t call for a gun ban or sign on to Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s compensated confiscation plan at the Kennedy Center honors. Instead, he offered an amusing take on why he supports the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, as well as heartfelt thanks for the opportunities and friendships he\u2019s had over the years.\n\n\u201cAn honor like this would be special anywhere it happened, but the fact that it\u2019s happening here in Washington does make me feel like I\u2019ve closed some sort of circle,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I came home and everyone\u2019s OK. My friends still love me and everything still feels right.\u201d\n\nCongratulations to Dave Chappelle for a well-deserved honor, and thanks for speaking up in support of some of our most important rights.", "description": "Receiving the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, the comedian says the Second Amendment is there in case \"the First one doesn't work out.\"", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/239/45c4ce72-bd72-4314-9837-6ac7e646c195.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
