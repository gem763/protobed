Our panel responds | Polly Toynbee and others", "language": "en", "text": "Polly Toynbee: \u2018Corbyn\u2019s fence-sitting is preposterous\u2019\n\nNeutral! In mid-national crisis how does a party campaign on the great issue of our time with a leader who won\u2019t say where he stands? Everything about the idea is preposterous. What do canvassers say on the doorstep? We\u2019re a bit split and our leader refuses to say.\n\nJeremy Corbyn in today\u2019s Guardian accuses Boris Johnson of backing no deal simply because it\u2019s politically expedient. But Corbyn\u2019s fence-sitting is no different. No one expects straight-dealing from Johnson: double-dealing is priced in. But it\u2019s dangerous for Corbyn to flaunt callow political calculation. Honesty is his USP. What else was he doing all those wilderness back-bench years voting against his own government 500 times, if not standing up for unpopular principle? He was always a leaver, remain voters will assume, while leavers will not be convinced either by his umpire\u2019s disguise.\n\nJeremy Corbyn: I\u2019ll stay neutral and let the people decide on Brexit Read more\n\nHe has spent his life advocating Bennite democracy, where the party makes policy, not the leaders. Most of the party, plus the great majority of its voters, are strong remainers: how does he square that?\n\nBut wait, there is \u2013 just \u2013 a hair\u2019s breadth of an escape hatch in his article. He would renegotiate a less-damaging Brexit, put it to a referendum and implement the result. That\u2019s fine. Though he implies his role is only as referee, he doesn\u2019t \u2013 quite \u2013 say he would campaign for neither side. It\u2019s for this weekend\u2019s Labour conference to make him take his members\u2019 side \u2013 not some conference floor stitch-up by some unions and backroom fixers. If not, expect another mighty flight of Labour voters to the Liberal Democrats.\n\n\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist\n\nTom Kibasi: \u2018Labour\u2019s plan is common sense\u2019\n\nWith Labour conference fast approaching, the party has now firmed up its commitment to giving the people the \u201cfinal say\u201d on Brexit as the only way to break the impasse. Jeremy Corbyn has set out his unequivocal support for a referendum between remain and a \u201csensible\u201d plan to leave.\n\nLabour can make such a commitment precisely because its proposals for the future partnership with the EU were welcomed by senior EU leaders earlier in the year as a way to break the deadlock. Unburdened by Brexit dogma, Labour\u2019s plan also has the benefit of being common sense: continuing the UK\u2019s economic, social and security cooperation but on a new and different political basis. It was always the logical response to a close vote.\n\nThere will still be pressure for Labour to be more vocally committed to remain. But as the Liberal Democrats have shown in Bournemouth this week, becoming a \u201cremain party\u201d is neither simple nor costless. Leading Lib Dems have found themselves unable to consistently explain when they would support revoke and when they would want a second referendum. That\u2019s because \u201crevoke\u201d is the demand of a pressure group, not a serious political party.\n\nBut with activists lined up to demand a remain position against more circumspect trade unions, there is potential for a major row at the Labour conference next week. Only Corbyn can defuse it \u2013 by emphasising that Labour is a democratic and pluralist party that will respect those who support leaving the EU while reminding members that he himself campaigned to remain in 2016 and would do so again.\n\nOnly Labour will give the people a final say on Brexit | Jeremy Corbyn Read more\n\nIf Britain is to move on from Brexit, it needs a vision for the economy and society beyond Brexit and political leadership capable of governing for the whole nation, whether we are in or out of the EU.\n\nPuffed-up gesture politics for revoke or for no deal will keep the country in crisis far into the 2020s. The Tories and Lib Dems have promised to hurtle Britain towards calamity \u2013 whether via the economic crash promised by the former, or the democratic disaster by the latter. Now is Labour\u2019s chance to show it can pull Britain back from the brink.\n\n\u2022 Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research. He writes in a personal capacity\n\nGiles Wilkes: \u2018It\u2019s not simple, but Corbyn\u2019s position is oddly honourable\u2019\n\nYou do not have to like them to realise the best political slogans \u2013 think \u201cVote leave, take control\u201d, \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d or \u201cMake America great again\u201d \u2013 are the ones you can fit on a bus or baseball cap.\n\nSo pity the Labour staffer tasked with turning Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position into something pithy. The best I can manage is \u201cBrexit, but not this Brexit, or maybe not Brexit at all \u2013 over to you\u201d. It is a neat manifestation of the agonies he has suffered for three years on this issue.\n\nIt is also rather unfair. Brexit is complicated. Only the zealots think there is no compromise to be made. There are plenty: between our economic interests and political fit, between what the people and their elected representatives think is best, between the simplicity of slogans and the ugly reality of our entanglement in the European economy. As a would-be majority party, Labour has to contain multitudes, and contradict itself.\n\nSo I find something oddly honourable in Corbyn\u2019s refusal to get off the fence. But what looks like an honest acknowledgment of ambiguity to some is a sneaky lack of principle to others. How can an issue so important to so many elicit such a painstakingly calculated shrug?\n\nIn 10 years each of the major parties has tried to sell itself as the only one to offer the people a vote on Europe. But people are fatigued, and want something simple to end it all. Honourable or not, \u201cover to you\u201d is the last thing most of them want to hear.\n\n\u2022 Giles Wilkes is a former adviser to Vince Cable and Theresa May on economic policy\n\nLisa Nandy: \u2018Labour is the only party acknowledging divisions in the country\u2019\n\nI didn\u2019t support the first referendum and do not support a second. But the sentiment behind Labour\u2019s stance is important, recognising divisions and seeking to allow them expression. Labour is divided because the country is divided. We represent places that voted to leave and remain in large numbers. In Walthamstow, another referendum and remain seems obvious to many; in Wigan, for the most part, it seems absurd. To pick a side kills any hope of bringing a divided country back together. We can no more wish away the votes of 17.4 million people who voted leave than the 16.1 million who voted remain \u2013 and nor should we.\n\nThe Labour party\u2019s Brexit stance is the grownup thing to do | Letters Read more\n\nNevertheless, problems remain. To make a case to hold a second referendum before there has been any serious attempt to implement the first is impossible in many constituencies. People who voted, after years of disillusionment, strongly believe democracy is at stake. We cannot defend liberal democracy against a prime minister who trashes it without acknowledging the harm this does.\n\nStill, there is honesty in acknowledging that divisions exist and that those who pretend there are easy answers are not being truthful. A referendum considered illegitimate by many will have severe consequences. Leaving with no deal will put jobs and lives at risk. Negotiating a good deal will take years. I believe the right compromise is to leave with a deal that protects our close ties with the EU, but there are no paths open to us that do not come at a cost. Labour is the only party prepared to acknowledge it, and the truth matters.\n\n\u2022 Lisa Nandy is the Labour MP for Wigan", "description": "The Labour leader has set out his Brexit stall, vowing to remain neutral and give the people a final say.
