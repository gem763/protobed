This much is clear: The bitter information wars in Hong Kong keep taking new turns since pro-democracy demonstrators took to the streets in June.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis time it is Hong Kong\u2019s domestic workers being drawn into the political tensions. The leaflets, which first appeared last month, did not specifically call out domestic workers, With writing in Bahasa, their target was evident.\n\nThe fliers \u2014 whether real or not \u2014 have accomplished at least some disruptions and indicate an intent to sow distrust and paranoia among Hong Kongers.\n\nSuddenly, domestic workers feel under more scrutiny. Meanwhile, their employers \u2014 mainly expatriate workers and well-off Hong Kong families \u2014 are left wondering whether they might be watched in their own homes.\n\n'Information war'\n\n\u201cInformation war is a psychological warfare. Divide and conquer is a proven strategy,\u201d said Masato Kajimoto, a disinformation expert and assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Journalism and Media Studies Center. \u201cIt is hard to go on protesting if one cannot trust the people who live with him or her at home.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHong Kong\u2019s nearly 400,000 domestic workers \u2014 about half from Indonesia \u2014 have largely been on the sidelines in the unrest. The community has come into sharper focus since police shot an Indonesian journalist, Veby Mega Indah, with a projectile on Sept. 29, blinding her right eye.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Muslim community \u2014 which includes many from Indonesia \u2014 also came into focus on Sunday after a police water cannon sprayed the entrance of the city\u2019s largest mosque with blue-dye while clearing an anti-government protest. Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam visited the mosque on Monday to apologize.\n\nTargeting domestic helpers as potential informants carries an eerie resonance with China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, a decade of political upheaval that began in the mid-1960s and included public denunciations of those considered at odds with the state.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt also highlights one of the central fears of protesters: that China will systematically erode the freedoms granted to Hong Kong under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy promised when Beijing took control of the former British colony in 1997.\n\n\u201cCultural Revolution again! For consideration of safety, please don\u2019t let your domestic helper know if you participate in the protest or not!\u201d said one Facebook message about the fliers. The post had more than 1,200 shares.\n\nNuraini Hasan, 27, a domestic worker from Indonesia\u2019s Lombok island, called the leaflet dangerous. She also said he believed it was fake, intended only to ripple fear through communities of domestic workers in Hong Kong led by Indonesians and Filipinos.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe Indonesians don\u2019t believe this,\u201d Hasan said.\n\n'Throwing a bunch of seeds'\n\nThe flier\u2019s architect remains unknown. It lists a website, 803.hk, with a domain registered under the name of Leung Chun-ying, a former leader of Hong Kong who is considered supportive of Beijing.\n\nThe site was launched after protesters threw a Chinese flag into Hong Kong\u2019s harbor on Aug. 3 and offers rewards for information. Leung advertised the site multiple times on his Facebook page. In another post, he called on \u201cdrivers, maids, fast-food store staff, convenience store staff\u201d to be whistleblowers.\n\nThe hotline linked to 803.hk did not return messages for comment left by The Washington Post. Leung\u2019s office did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe challenge in quashing dissent in Hong Kong is pinpointing it.\n\nWith all protest activity orchestrated anonymously online, the movement is largely leaderless. This leaves pro-government groups without an \u201cobvious place to look\u201d for targets, said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a historian of modern China at the University of California at Irvine.\n\n\u201cThe power of that means it\u2019s much harder to break the back of the movement,\u201d Wasserstrom said. \u201cBut from the side of oppression, it seems to have led to the idea of using any means to find who\u2019s participating.\u201d\n\nPuja Kapai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong and expert on minority rights, called the fliers \u201ca call to essentially participate in covert spying activities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMaybe [the creators of the flier] are just throwing a bunch of seeds out there to see which one shows the sign of blossoming,\u201d said Kajimoto, the disinformation expert.\n\nAD\n\nSkepticism\n\nAside from the brief social media frenzy, the flier\u2019s sloppy translation and sketchy presentation failed to woo domestic workers.\n\nAmong dozens of Indonesian migrant workers approached by The Post, few recognized the leaflet. Those who did called it fake and said they would never jeopardize their job. By and large, indifference was the prevailing sentiment.\n\nHong Kong is home to more than 174,000 Indonesians, 95 percent of whom are domestic workers, according to 2018 immigration figures provided by Hong Kong\u2019s Indonesian Consulate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSome Facebook posts are not real. I don\u2019t care about that,\u201d said an Indonesian domestic worker, Rina, 33, when shown the flier.\n\n\u201cI come here just as a domestic helper. I just want to work,\u201d said Rina, who asked that only her first name be used to avoid potential problems with authorities.\n\nAD\n\nIn August, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube identified more than 200,000 China-based accounts linked to what Twitter described as a \u201csignificant state-backed information operation \u2026 deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Indonesian Consulate also had no information pertaining to the flier, calling it \u201cquite unprecedented.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDuring this social and political crisis in Hong Kong, we have encountered a lot of unconfirmed or even false information \u2026 that are circulated among Indonesians living in Hong Kong,\u201d Erwin M. Akbar, consul for Consular Affairs, wrote in a statement to The Post. \u201cOur effort in the Consulate is focused on ensuring that the Indonesian Migrant Workers are not involved in the current situation in Hong Kong.\u201d This includes not sharing any views on social media.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSome care, some don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hasan, the worker from Lombok, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be very close, but need to know what is [happening]. This our workplace.\u201d\n\nShibani Mahtani and Tiffany Liang contributed to this report.", "description": "A mysterious flier aimed at Indonesian workers called for information on \u201cradical protesters.\u201d", "authors": ["Casey Quackenbush"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VbCfTnqVKeiWhmJNIU_hzJhlgEQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HOI5GQHSQII6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
