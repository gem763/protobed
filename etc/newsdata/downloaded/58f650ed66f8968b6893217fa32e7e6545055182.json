Sure it can mean that. Although he no longer has the long string of hair hanging from his forehead.\n\nWait, is this THE Swampy? Yup.\n\nThe 1990s eco-heartthrob for girls who were sick of plastic rebels like East 17 and wanted a boy who lives underground? I don\u2019t think there were very many of those girls. But yes, him. You might remember him from such protests as the A30 extension in Devon, and the Newbury bypass.\n\nI mainly remember him being sheepish and sweet-natured on Have I Got News For You. Yeah, he did that, too. Anyway, now he\u2019s back.\n\nBack underground? Back on TV.\n\nIn I\u2019m a Celebrity? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be good at that, but no. He was on ITV News, following his court appearance for wilful obstruction of the highway.\n\nThat Swampy. What mischief has he got up to now? Attaching himself to a concrete block at the entrance to the Valero fuel refinery in Pembrokeshire. It was part of an Extinction Rebellion protest last month.\n\nDoesn\u2019t concrete generate a lot of carbon dioxide? This was only a little bit of concrete. Just enough to make Swampy and his nine friends difficult to remove. In the end they lasted 12 hours, then left.\n\nDesperate for the toilet, I expect. I assume so. Swampy pleaded guilty to a magistrate in Haverfordwest, and was required to pay fines and costs amounting to \u00a3157.\n\nIs he likely to become the face of Extinction Rebellion then? I doubt it. He says he didn\u2019t enjoy being seen as a figurehead when he was young. \u201cI hated it,\u201d he told ITV. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do, and I don\u2019t think it did the movement much good.\u201d\n\nEco-warrior Swampy on Extinction Rebellion: 'It gives me hope' Read more\n\nIn that case why is he talking to the media again? Maybe he\u2019s just being polite. Besides, he has his own life now, with a partner and four kids.\n\nDo they all live underground, like Fraggles? Close. The last we heard, they were living in a tent on a commune in Wales. Swampy works for the Forestry Commission and likes running marathons.\n\nI suppose having four children and running marathons makes chaining yourself to a concrete block feel like a day off. I suppose so.\n\nDo say: \u201cI liked environmental activism before it was cool.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cAt this stage, maybe we should just buy a new environment.\u201d", "description": "The 1990s eco-activist has resurfaced after joining a protest against a fuel refinery in Pembrokeshire", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5314697fbd5f370c738670de918455ecfad3e5d7/0_83_1321_793/master/1321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c8c54fe42c0df4a293268d1e8f42d08c", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
