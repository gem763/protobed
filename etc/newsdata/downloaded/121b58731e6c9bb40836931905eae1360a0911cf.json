Neither assumption accurately reflected federal Title IX law or regulations.\n\nCollege officials also didn\u2019t act on several requests by the woman, including for excused absences from the classroom, which led her to withdraw, the civil rights office found.\n\nAn agreement reached between OCR and Buffalo State in October called for the college to make several steps, including a reimbursement of the student\u2019s non-tuition-related expenses for the semester she dropped out (she was already reimbursed for the cost of tuition) and retraining of key staff members on Title IX requirements.\n\nCatherine Lhamon, the department's civil rights chief under the Obama administration from 2013 until January 2017, said she was glad to see the Office for Civil Rights aggressively enforcing the law. And she said after some confusion following the release of new federal guidance last year on sexual harassment and assault, the letter reconfirms institutions' obligation to investigate incidents that occur off campus.\n\nDetails of Complaint\n\nThe female student (referred to in the OCR letter as the complainant) in January 2015 reported to Buffalo State police that she was sexually assaulted by another student, a member of a men\u2019s athletic team. Campus police originally took the complaint and, because the alleged incident took place off campus, referred the case to the Buffalo city police department.\n\nThe complainant, her mother and an advocate from an off-campus crisis services center requested several measures from the college before the student returned to campus, including her alleged assailant\u2019s removal from a course section they both attended and the excusing of absences accrued while she was at home recovering.\n\nBuffalo police eventually would conclude that there was not sufficient probable cause to make an arrest for the alleged assault. OCR\u2019s findings describe campus officials\u2019 own handling of the incident as inadequate and say they created a hostile environment for the woman.\n\nAlthough college officials eventually arranged for the student\u2019s alleged assailant to enroll in a different course, that information either wasn\u2019t conveyed to the complainant or she didn\u2019t believe assurances from college officials, leading her to avoid attending the course entirely, even after returning to campus. The college apparently failed to issue a no-contact order to the alleged assailant. And although college officials indicated they would address her absences from class, the woman later found out from professors that the absences and work she missed while recovering at home would not be excused.\n\nOCR found that Buffalo State\u2019s communication with the female student about Title IX grievance procedures was limited and confusing, leaving her without a clear understanding of the process and an impression that college officials were seeking to convince her not to file a complaint.\n\n\u201cThe complainant asserted that she withdrew from the college because the college made [her] feel unsafe, like the assault was [her] fault, and that [she] should just get over the fact that [she] was sexually assaulted and move on,\u2019\u201d according to the OCR letter.\n\nThe woman also alleged that her coach notified the coach of her alleged assailant's athletic team about the assault. (OCR said it could not find evidence of the claim. And the complainant\u2019s coach, as well as the men\u2019s coach, disputed that the complainant was identified in conversations.)\n\nThe documented failings of college officials were numerous, though, OCR found.\n\nAfter the alleged sexual assault was reported to Buffalo State police, the civil rights office said, college officials had an obligation to immediately investigate what happened, regardless of whether the female student directly reported the incident to administrators. But officials failed to do so, under the belief that they were not required to take action when an alleged incident occurred off campus or if an individual did not file a formal complaint.\n\nFederal investigators also linked the failure to act on measures sought by the student -- such as the excusing of absences -- to her eventual withdrawal. And college officials couldn\u2019t provide a reasonable explanation for not having taken action on the absences, OCR found.\n\n\u201cThe documentation provided to OCR by the college indicates that it not only failed to investigate the complainant\u2019s allegation of sexual assault, the college failed to conduct any assessment of whether the complainant was subjected to, or continued to be subjected to, a hostile environment,\u201d the determination letter said.\n\nThose failures occurred despite an agreement reached between OCR and the State University of New York system just two years before the alleged incident in January 2015. That resolution followed a Title IX compliance review of multiple SUNY campuses, including Buffalo State, and called for each campus in the system to provide Title IX training to appropriate staff and students. OCR received reports documenting that staff training in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\n\nThat training, as of 2015, should have tackled how to address allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment as well as the resources available to students who experience harassment or assault. Yet Buffalo State officials failed on all of those counts, according to OCR\u2019s findings.\n\nIn a written statement, a Buffalo State spokesman said the university has a \u201csteadfast commitment to conducting prompt, equitable and complete investigations of all reports of sexual violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cCollege staff members regularly receive training regarding Title IX and related procedures, and the most recent training related to the OCR resolution agreement served as a worthwhile reinforcement of the policies and proactive practices that are in place to provide a safe learning environment for our students,\u201d said Jerod Dahlgren, a college spokesman.\n\nClarifying the Role of Colleges\n\nAs part of the October resolution agreement with the Education Department, Buffalo State has provided documentation of reimbursement of the complainant\u2019s expenses for the spring 2015 semester, the college and department officials said. It also has obtained outside consulting for the university\u2019s Title IX coordinator and training on sexual harassment for university staff.\n\nAn outside investigation -- at the university\u2019s expense -- of the complainant\u2019s alleged assault required by the resolution agreement is still in progress. The Office for Civil Rights also will seek detailed reports from Buffalo State of its handling of sexual harassment complaints, including sexual assault, for the current academic year and the 2018-19 academic year.\n\nLhamon, the former civil rights chief, said she is a strong believer in OCR maintaining an active enforcement role for a number of years after reaching an agreement that identifies any compliance issues. And although she has been critical of other steps taken by the department, she said the agreement was a positive sign.\n\n\"I do think it's really encouraging to see OCR still taking appropriate steps, to see leadership still entering resolution agreements that are consistent with the law,\" she said. \"This looks to me like good work from OCR and that's encouraging.\"\n\nLhamon said the letter detailing civil rights investigators' findings should also clarify for colleges their obligations to investigate incidents that occur off campus and involve allegations of sexual harassment and assault. The Education Department last year rescinded 2011 and 2014 guidance on colleges' responsibilities for handling sexual harassment and assault. Department officials said they would craft a new regulation addressing campus assault and issued new interim guidance to colleges in September.\n\nThat document, Lhamon said, created confusion among advocates and higher ed institutions about their obligations to investigate misconduct that occurs off campus. She said OCR's findings at Buffalo State confirm that colleges are required to investigate a report of sexual assault regardless of whether it occurred on or off campus.\n\nAlexandra Brodsky, a fellow at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said when a survivor does not want to pursue a formal disciplinary complaint, a college should respect that decision. Buffalo State officials, however, appeared to discourage the student from making a complaint at all, she said.\n\nEven if the student had been well informed about the discipline process and made a decision not to report, Brodsky said, details about college officials' handling of accommodations requested by the student were troubling.\n\n\u201cIn our conversations about Title IX and sexual assault, including those conversations that this department has led, we are so focused on discipline,\u201d Brodsky said. \u201cBut for many survivors, accommodations like classroom changes and excused absences will make the difference between them staying in school and dropping out or falling behind.\u201d\n\nBased on the OCR report, she said, it\u2019s hard to believe that other students at the college -- including students who may never have come forward to OCR -- have not been similarly mistreated.\n\nLhamon said the broad remedies put in place by the agreement between the Office for Civil Rights and Buffalo State should address concerns about the failures in this case being repeated. And she said that, thanks to the 2013 agreement between the SUNY system and OCR, investigators should have the information they need to determine if individual remedies are necessary for other students.\n\n\"They must look into it and they do have the information available,\" she said.", "description": "Buffalo State failed to investigate an alleged sexual assault or respond to a female athlete\u2019s requests, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights found.
