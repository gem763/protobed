Now, thanks to the new Breaking Bad movie, we\u2019re finally going to find out what happened to Jesse after he crashed through the gate of the neo-Nazi compound in that Chevrolet El Camino.\n\nOf course, that also means that fans are being treated to some real-life interactions between Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, who played the on-again, off-again partners in showrunner Vince Gilligan\u2019s hit AMC drama. Whether Cranston will appear in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (out Oct. 11) is still up in the air \u2014 some fans think he will be one of the \u201c10 familiar characters\u201d who Gilligan has said will return in the movie \u2014 but he showed up to support Paul at the film\u2019s world premiere regardless.\n\nAfter reuniting on the tan carpet outside of Los Angeles\u2019 Regency Village Theatre, Cranston and Paul posed for pictures while laughing and joking with each other, much to the delight of the crowd.\n\nAaron Paul and Bryan Cranston attend the premiere of Netflix's \"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\" at Regency Village Theatre in Westwood, California on October 07, 2019.
