(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe plaques\u2019 every word is a testament to pain \u2014 and to perjury.\n\n\u201cThis monument should no longer stand as a memorial to white brotherhood,\u201d reads a sign erected this summer alongside a Confederate statue in Georgia.\n\n\u201cThis monument \u2026 fostered a culture of segregation by implying that public spaces and public memory belonged to whites,\u201d reads another.\n\nDeclares a third: \u201cThis ignores the segregation and disenfranchisement of African Americans.\u201d\n\nAmericans are exploring a new way to deal with the country\u2019s Confederate monuments: place explanatory panels on or alongside the statues detailing the real history behind them. It\u2019s the latest frontier in the nation\u2019s ongoing \u2014 and, in recent years, horrifically violent \u2014 reckoning with the statues, troubling testaments to the country\u2019s racist past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening in all sorts of places,\u201d said Adam Domby, a history professor at the College of Charleston who is writing a book about Confederate monuments. \u201cStill, it\u2019s clearly in many cases being used as a stopgap because the laws prohibit removing them.\u201d\n\nAtlanta installed markers next to four of the city\u2019s most prominent Confederate monuments in August. Officials in Decatur, Ga., placed a sign near a Confederate monument this month. Come October, three such markers will go up in downtown Franklin, Tenn. Cities including Savannah, Ga., and Richmond are weighing proposals to contextualize their monuments in a similar manner, according to the Atlanta History Center, which maintains an online database tracking the fate of Confederate monuments.\n\n[Are Confederate monument fans committing the sin of idol worship? An unusual Bible study makes the case.]\n\nAt least seven states passed legislation in recent years to protect their Confederate monuments, a wave that began around the 2000s and includes a law passed as recently as 2017. Such statutes, which vary in language but generally prohibit removal of the monuments, are in effect in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nThere are roughly 1,700 Confederate monuments still standing across the United States as of 2019, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Most were erected between the 1890s and the 1920s \u2014 during the rise of Jim Crow laws and the disenfranchisement of African Americans \u2014 and more appeared in the late 1940s in response to the desegregation of the U.S. Armed Forces and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to integrate schools, according to James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association.\n\n\u201cThese statues are there because groups of white Southerners wanted to have a certain view of history legitimized: a view that bolstered white supremacy,\u201d Grossman said.\n\n\n\nA monument to Confederate soldiers in Nashville's Centennial Park was vandalized in June. (Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nThough many African Americans have disliked and protested against the monuments since their installation, Grossman said, opposition to Confederate symbols exploded into the mainstream following deadly racial violence in Charleston, S.C., in 2015 and in Charlottesville in 2017. Towns and cities across the country have been struggling to decide how to handle their statues ever since.\n\nProponents of installing explanatory markers say that \u2014 especially in states where removal is illegal \u2014 the tactic is realistic, inexpensive and swiftly achievable. Some go further, arguing that the signs are the best tactic, period.\n\nMarkers keep the peace among locals on both sides of the issue, while educating the public on vital aspects of American history, said Dana McLendon, a member of the Franklin City Council. McLendon said he disagrees with the idea of total removal.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remember that history because it reminds us for the potential to happen again, and that\u2019s a particularly relevant and poignant thing to think about today,\u201d said McLendon, who voted to install markers in Franklin. \u201cOf course, it definitely needs the additional context that we now have the political will and fortitude to present.\u201d\n\n[Charlottesville's Confederate statues still stand \u2014 and still symbolize a racist legacy]\n\nFranklin\u2019s monument \u2014 a statue of a Confederate soldier nicknamed Chip \u2014 stands 37 feet high inside a roundabout downtown. Language on its side suggests the soldiers of the Confederacy fought for a noble cause. After at least two years of discussion, spurred in part by the deadly 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, the city council voted early this year to place signs detailing African American history near the statue.\n\nOne marker will hail the U.S. Colored Troops, regiments of African American soldiers who did battle for the Union in the Civil War. Another will describe a former slave market that operated on the site. Still another will mention African American achievement during Reconstruction. Together, they\u2019ll cost $10,000 or $12,000, a bill paid entirely by private donors after a money-raising drive led by local pastors and a historian.\n\n\u201cWe feel, leave it there, let\u2019s talk about what past generations couldn\u2019t talk about,\u201d said Chris Williamson, one of the pastors, who is African American. \u201cPast generations had to accept what was spoon-fed to them about the war, the cause of the war, all that \u2014 but now we\u2019re in an age of education and truth seeking.\u201d\n\n\n\nA statue commemorating fallen Confederate soldiers stands outside a courthouse in Clinton, La. (Gerald Herbert/AP)\n\nWilliamson, his fellow pastors and the historian aren\u2019t done: They plan to raise money to install a statue of a Colored Troops officer in a \u201cplace of equal nobility\u201d with Chip, ideally in front of a nearby courthouse. They expect the statue will cost a substantial sum (about $150,000) but expressed optimism about their chances.\n\nThough cautioning that every city must pursue its own unique solution, Williamson said other towns with Confederate markers should at least consider adding contextualizing markers. McLendon called the vote to install the signs \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve ever done\u201d on the city council.\n\nNonetheless, a vocal contingent of Americans and historians assert that removing the Confederate statues is the only way to challenge the false, white-supremacist narrative they promote.\n\nJalane Schmidt, a University of Virginia professor who offers free monthly tours of Charlottesville\u2019s monuments, said she has noticed the trend: \u201cI see that people are making an effort to have some sort of clapback,\u201d she said of the signs. However, she said that\u2019s nowhere near enough.\n\n\u201cThese statues have no business being there in the first place,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re just putting a Band-Aid on it \u2014 a little tiny plaque, compared to this huge monument. You can see the monument a long ways away; you have to get up real close to see a plaque.\u201d\n\n[Two women lead a free tour of Charlottesville's Confederate statues each month. A new website lets everyone listen.]\n\nThis, in part, is why Sheffield Hale, Atlanta History Center\u2019s president and chief executive, said he hates plaques.\n\nHe clarified that the four markers constructed in Atlanta this summer are \u201cexhibit panels.\u201d Each one is the product of years-long, careful discussion held by an advisory committee Atlanta formed in the wake of Charlottesville to consider the city\u2019s Confederate monuments and street names.\n\nAll four markers \u2014 sited alongside monuments including an obelisk and the Lion of Atlanta, which guards the graves of 3,000 unknown Confederate dead \u2014 give information about the historical moment in which the Confederate monuments were built. All are funded by a private donor through the history center, Hale said. Though large and free-standing, the panels are relatively inexpensive, costing around $11,000 total, he said.\n\nHale said he hopes he can encourage other places around the country to follow in Atlanta\u2019s footsteps. The Atlanta History Center in 2016 debuted a comprehensive online guide to installing markers at Confederate monuments.\n\n\u201cWe want people to go to the site and say, \u2018Oh, I can do that,\u2019 \u201d Hale said. \u201cDepending on where they\u2019re located, you can pretty effectively contextualize many of these with a marker. It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, it just needs to start, or continue, a conversation.\u201d\n\n\n\nA statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee stands in the middle of a traffic circle in Richmond. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the quest for perfection that derailed plans to add explanatory signs to a Confederate fountain in Helena, Mont., however.\n\nThe fountain, installed in the early 1900s as one of the only Confederate monuments in the northwestern United States, included an inscription on its side that dubbed it \u201cA Loving Tribute to our Confederate Soldiers.\u201d City officials began discussing adding a contextualizing sign in 2015, but ultimately chose to remove the fountain in August 2017.\n\nThat decision followed urgent calls for its elimination and worry that its continued presence might spur violence, according to Ed Noonan, a city commissioner for Helena.\n\nBut it was also about the word count.\n\n\u201cTo put it in a full historical context, it was too massive an amount of information,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cUltimately, people thought language was just inadequate.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s the latest frontier in the nation\u2019s ongoing \u2014 and, in recent years, horrifically violent \u2014 efforts to wrestle with the statues, troubled testaments to the country\u2019s racist past.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
