But he has now been given the news he was dreading after an X-ray confirmed he would have to return home for treatment.\n\nThe change will mean a second World Cup appearance for Pyrgos. He is scheduled to arrive in Japan on Thursday and take his place in the 31-man group preparing to face Samoa at the Kobe Misaki Stadium on Monday.\n\nTownsend said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed for Ali to have to return home so early in the tournament. Both Ali and Hamish had invested a lot of effort into being in their best physical shape for the World Cup and it\u2019s a shame that they\u2019ve only been involved in one game. However, we have a lot of belief in our wider group and the two new players, Magnus Bradbury and Henry Pyrgos, who have been given this opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan have accused Cian Healy of illegal scrummaging tactics, cranking up the tension before Saturday\u2019s World Cup meeting with Ireland.\n\nThe tighthead prop Yusuke Kizu could find himself directly facing down the in-form Healy in Shizuoka \u2013 but had no qualms calling out the British and Irish Lions star\u2019s set-piece technique. \u201cTheir loosehead prop steps out, so they try to attack from the side, that\u2019s my impression of their scrum,\u201d said Kizu. \u201cIreland\u2019s forwards really attack close to the rucks so we need to have double collisions to stop their momentum, and we need to execute our system for us to achieve that.\n\n\u201cIt was a positive tight-five review from the Russia game in that our defence really came up hard and we were able to force them back.\u201d\n\nJohnny Sexton did not train fully on Tuesday but Ireland still expect him to be fit for the game in Shizuoka. The skills coach Richie Murphy insisted it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be unusual\u201d for the fly-half Sexton to sit out a training session only 48 hours after playing in a Test.\n\nMurphy also revealed Peter O\u2019Mahony and Bundee Aki have passed their head injury checks and returned to full training, leaving both available for the Japan clash.", "description": "Scotland\u2019s World Cup hopes have suffered a third major blow in as many days", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb8043ca1189cbe7bfaf24fbf0e216fb07c90b8e/0_194_2346_1408/master/2346.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=462eedef8770b9aea68f547904373618", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
