Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt will be a clash of Minnesota\u2019s top-10 defense against New York rookie quarterback Daniel Jones, who has won his first two starts after replacing veteran Eli Manning. Jones led the Giants to 32-31 and 24-3 victories over the Buccaneers and Redskins, respectively, to push New York to 2-2.\n\nIn Tampa Bay, Jones found a soft landing spot for his first NFL game. Against Washington, he had a foe that he could make a couple of mistakes against and still win easily, given the kind of mess that the Redskins have become.\n\nIn the Vikings (2-2), Jones faces his stiffest test by far. Minnesota has a solid front seven and a good secondary, and coach Mike Zimmer has never been afraid to throw different looks at young quarterbacks to confuse them.\n\n\u201cThey have two edge rushers, they have interior guys that can get push,\u201d said New York coach Pat Shurmur. \u201cThey have linebackers that are Pro Bowlers. They have corners and they have safeties that have all been to Pro Bowls.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re well-coordinated and they put pressure on the passer and they do a good job of stopping the run. That\u2019s what you want from a defense.\u201d\n\nAfter hitting 23 of 36 passes for 336 yards against the defenseless Buccaneers in his first start and running for the game-winning touchdown in the final two minutes, Jones shrugged off two picks against Washington. He completed 23 of 31 attempts for 225 yards and an early score.\n\nZimmer likes what he\u2019s seen of Jones on video.\n\n\u201cDaniel Jones is obviously a very, very talented kid,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a really good player, and I think he\u2019s going to be a great player. He\u2019s got an outstanding arm, he\u2019s got good feet in the pocket and he moves well. He scrambles.\u201d\n\nWhile Jones has drawn raves so far, Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins has elicited groans. Despite having two of the best receivers in the league, Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen, Minnesota is somehow ranked 31st in the league in passing.\n\nThe blame is being placed on Cousins, who has completed 64.6 percent of his passes but for only 183.8 yards per game. A 16-6 road loss to the Chicago Bears last Sunday only increased the howls. Cousins completed 27 of 36 passes, but for only 233 yards, and absorbed six sacks for 51 yards.\n\nCousins felt the need to apologize to Thielen during a radio appearance Tuesday, saying there were opportunities for him that the quarterback didn\u2019t convert. On paper, Cousins may have a chance to make it up to Thielen. New York has the league\u2019s 25th-rated pass defense, even after it picked off four passes against Washington.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about all that stat stuff,\u201d Shurmur said, \u201cI just know they are very dangerous.\u201d\n\nHe would know that better than most. Shurmur was Zimmer\u2019s offensive coordinator from the middle of the 2016 season through 2017, helping Minnesota reach the NFC title game before taking the Giants\u2019 job for 2018.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "In boxing, the axiom says that styles make fights.
