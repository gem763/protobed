Justin Amash (I-Mich.) is speaking out against Hillary Clinton\u2019s suggestion that presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is being positioned by Russia for a third-party run, warning the implication plays into President Donald Trump\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cThe thing we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is a Donald Trump asset,\u201d Amash tweeted early Saturday. \u201cHillary does \u2014 and did \u2014 drive many people into the arms of Donald Trump. Her attack on Tulsi does likewise.\u201d\n\nHillary does\u2014and did\u2014drive many people into the arms of Donald Trump. Her attack on Tulsi does likewise. In my district, Trump did worse than any Republican in modern times and still beat Clinton by a fair margin. Many Ds in the Midwest rejected her. I didn\u2019t vote for either one. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) October 19, 2019\n\nAmash, fed up with party politics and disillusioned by Trump\u2019s impact on the GOP, left the party in July, declaring himself an independent.\n\nControversy has brewed over Clinton\u2019s remarks since the Friday release of a \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast interview in which she asserted without evidence that \u201csomebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary\u201d is being groomed \u201cto be the third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nThough the remarks were widely interpreted as referring to Russia, Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill denied that interpretation on Friday, arguing she was instead referring to Republicans.\n\nWhile Clinton did not name Gabbard, the candidate complained on the Ohio debate stage earlier this week about a New York Times article reporting that Russian state media has focused significant attention on her White House bid. Gabbard also appeared to lash out against CNN analyst Bakari Sellers, who recently claimed \u2015 again, without evidence \u2015 that she \u201cis a puppet for the Russian government.\u201d\n\nClinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, later seemed to use that same message in her interview.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have a bunch of sites and bots and ways of supporting her so far. And that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset.\u201d\n\nBoth Stein and Gabbard vociferously rebuked Clinton\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame HRC is peddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016,\u201d Stein tweeted Friday.\n\nRussian bots aggressively promoted Stein\u2019s candidacy in the lead-up to the 2016 election, and she was famously photographed sitting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner in 2015.\n\nStein\u2019s condemnation was soon followed by a spate of tweets from Gabbard, who slammed Clinton as \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long,\u201d employing lines that have been used by Trump.\n\nGabbard has since received support from fellow Democratic candidates Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This article has been amended to note that Clinton\u2019s spokesperson argued she was referring Republicans, not Russia in part of her remarks.\n\nLove HuffPost?
