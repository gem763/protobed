On top of that, Charity (Emma Atkins) is set to have some Dingle matters to deal with in upcoming weeks with Aaron (Danny Miller) going off the rails, Cain (Jeff Hordley) discovering the affair of Moira (Natalie J Robb) and Mandy (Lisa Riley) causing more headaches.\n\nOn top of that, Chas (Lucy Pargeter) will soon go into labour and welcome a baby into the world \u2013 so there is a lot going on. With fans hailing Vanity as a partnership with deep emotion and feeling, allowing huge development for both characters since that fateful kiss in the cellar, it\u2019s refreshing that the show plans to take its time and not rush through the milestones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to Inside Soap, Kate teased: It is something that will eventually happen in time, but it\u2019s not on the cards immediately. In real life, people stay engaged for two or three years, although I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ll have to wait that long!\n\n\u2018Currently we have a nice dynamic with the two of them living together with Moses, Johnny, Noah, and Sarah, and it\u2019s about the problems that people face day to day. They have two teenagers in the house that aren\u2019t going to be easy, and it\u2019s about how they test Charity and Vanessa\u2019s relationship.\u2019\n\nAs it is soap, tests are inevitable but if a wedding is somewhere on the horizon, it sounds like a long term future is still very much the plan for Vanity \u2013 and good things come to those who wait!\n\nMeanwhile, Emmerdale has other major plots kicking off between now and Christmas, with a spectacular explosion ending the affair of Moira and Nate and the aftermath of Robert Sugden\u2019s (Ryan Hawley) exit playing out.\n\nIn real life, Kate and Michelle recently celebrated their wedding with friends and loved ones by throwing a joyful party.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Vaity head down the aisle.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/07_06_emm_vanessa_charity_01hfdshsfhfshfdshfsdhfshsfdhsfdfhsdhfsshfsfhshfshfshfhsfdhsfshf-7641_1571138099.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
