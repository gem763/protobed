I'm never having another baby ever again, that's for sure.\n\n'It was agony. I could feel them actually pulling my stomach apart as they were ripping the muscles. I was in extreme pain.\n\n'It felt like I was screaming, but my partner said it was only coming out as a whisper. Luckily the doctors could see I was uncomfortable.'\n\nJodie and husband Matt, 34, first fell pregnant after their wedding in September 2018 - but the mother miscarried at seven weeks.\n\nFollowing their first Christmas as a married couple, the duo found out they were expecting again.\n\nDoctors gave the dog groomer an epidural, a pain relief injected into the spine, to mask the extreme discomfort - but it gradually started to lose its effectiveness.

An epidural is an injection in the back to stop you feeling pain in part of your body. It can be used during childbirth, including caesareans as well as during other types of surgery. Source: NHS\n\nShe was rushed for an emergency C-section after Arthur's blood pressure also dropped dangerously low.\n\nDespite numerous checks to ensure she was numb before the procedure, the epidural stopped working during surgery.\n\nMedics rushed to give Jodie more pain relief medication after noticing her discomfort but she \u2018could still feel them inside her body\u2019.\n\nFearing she might suffer a stroke or heart attack due to her dangerously high blood pressure, doctors were forced to put the dog groomer under general anaesthetic after she gave birth.\n\nAfter being monitored for 16 hours, Jodie finally got to hold her son the day after his birth and is now continuing her recovery at home.\n\nDespite the traumatic experience, Jodie (pictured with her husband) gave birth to a healthy little boy, Arthur George Marsden, weighing 6lb 12oz\n\nDespite loving Arthur very much and enjoying being a mother, Jodie said she has no plans for more children after her 'nightmare' experience.\n\nPinderfields Hospital couldn't comment on individual cases, but offered some clinical background information.\n\nA spokesperson said: 'During a c-section under local anaesthetic we advise women they will feel some pressure during the surgery.\n\n'If a woman complains of pain, the surgery is stopped and analgesia (such as Morphine or diamorphine) is given. Anaesthetists cannot administer a spinal block during a c-section but they can top up the epidural.\n\n'If a woman is still not comfortable at this point they will be given a general anaesthetic, however the priority is to get the baby delivered if the uterus is open and cord exposed.\n\n'Where mothers have raised blood pressure it is normal that they would be monitored closely for 12 or more hours following surgery.'", "description": "Jodie Marsden, 27, from  West Yorkshire, had an emergency C-section on after two days of labour, and despite having an epidural, she said she could feel medics 'pulling her stomach apart'.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19878646-0-image-a-2_1571393206213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
