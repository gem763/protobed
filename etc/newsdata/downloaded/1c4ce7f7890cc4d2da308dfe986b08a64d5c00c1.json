Carolina Waterfowl Rescue is treating the birds and asking for donations toward the effort.\n\nWhile an estimated 1 billion birds are killed annually by flying into windows in the U.S. during migratory periods, Audobon North Carolina senior network manager Kim Brand told the Observer that it\u2019s unusual for chimney swifts to do so and that the organization has never seen an event of this scale.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also odd that these swifts were out last night after 9 p.m. Normally, even during migration, Chimney Swifts go to roost in a chimney for the night around dusk. Yesterday, the sun set around 7 p.m,\u201d Brand said.\n\nThe organization has recommended that the museum turn off the lights through the end of the migration season in November.", "description": "Bizarre incident.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
