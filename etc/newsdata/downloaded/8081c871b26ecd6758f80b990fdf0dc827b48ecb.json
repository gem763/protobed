Earnings were $2.08 a share, up from $1.88 a share.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet were expecting $2.03 a share.\n\nRevenue net of interest expense was $10.99 billion, up 8.3% from a year ago. Analysts were expecting $10.94 billion.\n\nAmerican Express expects revenue to rise between 8% and 10% in the current quarter, Chief Executive Steve Squeri said in prepared remarks. He also reaffirmed the company's earnings guidance for the year.\n\n\"The trends we saw in the business this quarter continue to be consistent with an economy that continues to grow, albeit at a more modest pace than last year,\" Mr. Squeri said.\n\nThe company reported $879 million in provisions for losses, 7.6% higher from a year earlier.\n\nThis metric rose in the consumer-services division because of a rise in net lending write-offs and delinquencies, American Express said.\n\nExpenses rose 8.8% to $7.84 billion. Costs for marketing and business development rose, and costs for card-member rewards and services rose.\n\nThe board recently approved a new plan to buy back up to 120 million of its shares.\n\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 19, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
