The goal was to walk from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, and he successfully completed the trip after walking more than 2,800 miles and arriving in Venice Beach, California.\n\nPosner told Billboard that's he wanted to take on the trip \"for years and years,\" and felt particularly motivated after the death of his father due to brain cancer in 2017. The following year, his friend and collaborator Avicii committed suicide and Mac Miller died from an overdose.\n\nPosner also created a fundraiser to raise $100,000 to make sure that the daughters of his late friend Ronnie Posey II, Aautumn and Wynter, could afford to go to college.\n\nThe musician has been open about his journey, which he has titled \"The Walk Across America,\" by sharing updates with fans on social media.\n\n\"I don't even know what this experience means in the context of my life yet,\" Posner wrote on Twitter on Wednesday, days before finishing his walk.\n\n\"I do know that I am not the same person I was when I started,\" he continued. \"I'm harder. I'm more authentic. I'm more real. I'm more myself. That's the only trophy I need. Keep going.\"\n\nPrior to that, Posner revealed that he got bitten by a baby rattlesnake while walking through Colorado in August.\n\nRead more: 'I Took A Pill In Ibiza' singer Mike Posner is recovering after a rattlesnake bite left him unable to walk\n\n\"Crazy day yesterday!
