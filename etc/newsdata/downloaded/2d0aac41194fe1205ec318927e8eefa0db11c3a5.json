At the top of the list, according to Zillow, is not knowing whether the home will sell when the owners want it to, cited by 56 percent of those surveyed as stressful. Uncertainty about whether a home will sell for the homeowners\u2019 desired price was cited by 53 percent of those surveyed.\n\nSellers are equally stressed (52 percent) by the worry that an offer will fall through and by the demands of making home improvements and preparing their home for a sale.
