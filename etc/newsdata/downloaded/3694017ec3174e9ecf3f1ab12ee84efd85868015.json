Given the struggle that is now gaining momentum - they'll probably need it all too.\n\n\"Conventional broadcasters - and I include conventional cable and satellite players - who do not have a compelling pure-play digital strategy of their own risk being priced out of the best talent and best content. Even in their heyday, they'd have struggled to compete with these giants.\n\n\"Now with ad revenue - and in the case of the BBC, licence-fee - squeezed, their financial firepower is waning.\"\n\nHis speech coincided with an announcement that Fleabag and Killing Eve creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge had signed an exclusive deal with Amazon worth a reported $20m (\u00a316m) a year.\n\nThe UK government's media \"needs a fundamental change in direction\" in order to protect British voices, he argued.\n\n\"It's specifically to ensure that - alongside all the other content, great or otherwise, that they consume - the British public can still find news, drama, comedy, documentary and arts content which is commissioned out of and whose principal mission is to speak directly to this culture, these communities, these ways of life.\"\n\nMr Thompson left the BBC in 2012 to become chief executive of the New York Times.\n\nHe told the audience: \"A society which fails to provide its different communities and groups with the means to listen and come to understand each other's pasts and presents shouldn't be surprised if mutual incomprehension and division are the consequence.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
