Dominguez was the only one the Castro regime identified as having lost her life after receiving the MMR vaccine. Dominguez died on October 9.\n\nCuba\u2019s healthcare system has been dangerously ill-equipped to provide for the Cuban people for decades. Cuba sends its best doctors to work for free around the world in a \u201cslave doctor\u201d system that nets the regime as much as $11 billion a year while investing minimally in its healthcare system at home. The \u201cslave doctor\u201d program also serves as propaganda touting Cuba\u2019s alleged advances in medicine, regurgitated religiously by Western socialists seeking to impose state-run healthcare systems in their own countries. The Cuban healthcare system is also rapidly running out of basic medicine because the economy it exploits to keep afloat, that of Venezuela, is also collapsing under the weight of socialist mismanagement.\n\nCuban doctors who denounce the shortcomings of the communist healthcare system often find themselves imprisoned.\n\nMother Yaima Caballero posted several messages on her Instagram account \u2013 previously dedicated to posting photos and videos of Paloma Dominguez \u2013 explaining her decision to continue to pressure the Castro regime for a precise explanation on what killed her daughter, Diario de Cuba reported on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMany people are helping me protest using the internet, it is the only thing I can do now. But the person making this happen suggests that I ask friends who want to help me to change their profile pictures and use the one of my baby with the wings,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is not easy for me, but [it is] at least something, to put pressure on at all sides. Please, do it for her, not for me, change their profile photos in all your accounts and help me with this photo of her. Let\u2019s start there.\u201d\n\nShe then posted the photo she wished social media users would share of her late daughter.\n\n\u201cJoin my protest and make this your profile photo on all social media, please let those sons of whores who killed my girl see it and wherever they look, let them see this picture,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLet them see her to see if it reaches someplace and they do something for us and for her. This photo and along with it the word \u2018justice.'\u201d\n\nThe top comment in response to her post reads, \u201cI recommend that you consider leaving the country soon the government will block your accounts and isolate you on the internet. I hope to God I keep seeing you and find out what happened.\u201d\n\nCaballero has no publicly known record of opposition to the communist regime. Cuba punishes anyone who publicly disagrees with or criticizes the regime under the crime of desacato, or \u201ccontempt.\u201d Cuban state police also routinely arrest and disappear dissidents without offering them or their families any reason for doing so.\n\nCaballero has previously accused the government of \u201ckilling\u201d Dominguez in social media messages posted in the immediate aftermath of her death, when reports indicated that as many as 24 children were affected and another had died. Cuba\u2019s Public Health Ministry has since clarified that only five children are officially documented as having been affected and only Dominguez died, though Havana has a long history of falsifying medical records to appear to have a more successful healthcare system before the world than it actually has. Cuban slave doctors that have escaped the system have said that, while working abroad, the Castro regime forced them to invent patients and throw away perfectly good medicine to boost the statistics on the number of patients Cuban doctors actually treat. Cuba has for years also faced accusations of officially labeling stillborn children \u201cabortions\u201d to claim one of the world\u2019s lowest infant mortality rates.\n\nCubaDebate, a state media outlet, published an alleged explanation for Dominguez\u2019s death last week that identified no wrongdoing on the part of any medical staff or any cause of death for the child. It did provide more details on what Dominguez\u2019s last moments were like: vomiting, fever, swelling in the area of the vaccine, and toxic shock.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine is not the problem,\u201d Rafael P\u00e9rez Cristi\u00e1, the head of the Cuban Center for State Control of Medicines, Equipment, and Medical Devices (CECMED), is quoted as saying in the report. \u201cIt is a triple viral vaccine that protects against three grave disease which, thanks to its use, are now eliminated in the country.\u201d\n\nThe CECMED authorities, whose responsibility it is to ensure that faulty vaccines are not administered in the country, said the vaccine that killed Dominguez was part of a package of 43,630 doses that did not otherwise hurt children outside of the one clinic in which the five identified cases occurred. They do not explain why Dominguez died, hinting that her disposition was too delicate for the vaccine, but not explaining how no doctor identified this vulnerability.\n\nThe report includes an infographic encouraging parents to continue receiving the MMR vaccine with confidence.\n\nIn the West, the MMR vaccine has been falsely linked with autism, in part because the signs of autism tend to appear at the age of 1. \u201cVaccine safety experts, including experts at CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for increases in the number of children with autism,\u201d the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) affirms.\n\nOutside of the West, particularly in Africa, measles has become increasingly common as locals do not trust Western-based aid groups administering vaccines and ongoing paramilitary conflicts keep health workers from delivering vaccines. Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) \u2013 currently enduring the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history \u2013 is also experiencing a measles outbreak, also the world\u2019s worst known ongoing outbreak of any disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The mother of a one-year-old killed in a Cuban clinic after receiving a routine vaccination launched an awareness campaign Tuesday.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/palomadominguez-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
