REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nNow the Republican president has his own server problem as he seeks re-election to the White House in 2020.\n\nA whistleblower\u2019s complaint that has led the U.S. House of Representatives to open a Trump impeachment inquiry accuses White House officials of trying to conceal \u201cpolitically sensitive\u201d information about Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskiy by moving it to one of the government\u2019s most sensitive computer systems.\n\nThe whistleblower, in the complaint made public on Thursday, said White House lawyers directed officials to remove the call summary from the classified computer system, or server, where the administration normally stores those records to try to \u201clock down\u201d access to the information.\n\nTranscripts of presidents\u2019 phone calls are normally stored on a classified White House computer system accessible to \u201cat most, a low double-digit number of people,\u201d said Larry Pfeiffer, director of the Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy and International Security in Virginia.\n\nMoving the transcript to an even more restrictive system \u2013 one normally used to store information about specially sensitive government secrets \u2013 would be \u201cunusual given the contents of that call,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment about this story. Reuters was unable to corroborate the allegations about the server.\n\nABUSE FOR PERSONAL GAIN?\n\nAccording to the complaint, White House officials said they were discussing how to protect the contents of the call \u201cbecause of the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d\n\nUnder pressure after news of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint emerged in media reports, the White House on Wednesday released the call summary. The House Intelligence Committee demanded the complaint and on Thursday released it to the public.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s accusation opens up a potential line of attack by his political opponents on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump hammered Clinton during the 2016 campaign for her use of a private server to store sensitive government emails. The FBI investigated whether Clinton had mishandled classified materials and recommended against charging her with a crime despite concluding there was classified information among the emails she sent and received.\n\nClinton has denied sending or receiving classified information on her unsecured private email account. Longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said on Thursday that \u201cin a land of ironies this reigns king.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: \u2018PARTISAN HACK JOB\u2019\n\nTrump has dismissed the whistleblower complaint as a \u201cpartisan hack job.\u201d\n\nIntelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson told Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire in August that his office\u2019s review had found signs \u201cof arguable political bias\u201d by the whistleblower but concluded after a brief review that the account appeared both urgent and credible.\n\nThe complaint said White House officials had told the whistleblower it was \u201cnot the first time\u201d Trump\u2019s aides had moved a transcript of one of his conversations to the more-restricted computer system \u201cfor the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2013 rather than national security sensitive \u2013 information.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective,\u201d the whistleblower wrote in the nine-page complaint.", "description": "As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump repeatedly attacked his Democratic adversary Hillary Clinton in 2016 over her use of a private computer server for official emails when she was U.S. secretary of state.", "authors": ["Brad Heath", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434254944&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1TO", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
