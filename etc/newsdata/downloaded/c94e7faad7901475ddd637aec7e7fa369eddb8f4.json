In a glowing profile, the New York Times held up the restaurant as an emblem of \u201cCanada\u2019s embrace of the Syrian refugees\u201d.\n\nRemembrance of tastes past: Syria\u2019s disappearing food culture | Wendell Steavenson Read more\n\nEarlier this week, however, the family announced the restaurant would permanently close following a barrage of death threats after the owners\u2019 son was involved in an altercation outside a far-right politician\u2019s campaign event.\n\n\u201cOur decision is made with a heavy heart in effort to maintain our family and staff\u2019s safety,\u201d the owners said.\n\nThe announcement prompted despair among fellow Syrian immigrants, said Bayan Khatib, executive director at the Syrian Canadian Foundation.\n\n\u201cThey were a success story for all of us. They were an example of successful integration and of giving back,\u201d she said.\n\nThe threats against the family were linked to a decision by the owner\u2019s son Alaa to attend a political protest in September.\n\nAlaa had travelled to the city of Hamilton to join a demonstration outside a rally for a far-right populist candidate, Maxime Bernier, whose fringe People\u2019s Party of Canada has been described as xenophobic and racist.\n\nBut the protesters came under criticism after several of them were filmed blocking an elderly couple from crossing the street to attend the rally.\n\nFootage of the incident, which was viewed online more than 7 million times, showed one of the protesters shouting \u201cNazi scum, off our streets!\u201d at the couple.\n\nDorothy Marston, 81, and her husband, were only able to enter the rally with the help of police. \u201cThey were \u2026 treating me like I\u2019m a criminal,\u201d she told CBC News.\n\nOne of the protesters, wearing a black ski-mask and orange T-shirt, was identified as Alaa Al-Soufi \u2013 the son of the restaurant owners. He does not join in the abuse but can seen standing in Marston\u2019s path.\n\nSupporters of Bernier \u201cdoxxed\u201d Alaa, releasing his personal information online \u2013 and his family\u2019s restaurant became the target of a wave of hate messages.\n\nThe family said in a statement earlier this week that Alaa \u201cdid not in any way verbally or physically assault the elderly woman and has nonetheless offered to apologize personally for not doing more\u201d.\n\nBy then, however, the posts about the family, including the address and telephone numbers, were being widely shared on far-right and anti-immigrant Facebook groups.\n\nOn Tuesday, the family announced that they were permanently closing their business, adding: \u201cThe magnitude of hate we are facing is overwhelming.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian Canadian Foundation, where Alaa had volunteered, was also targeted with \u201cviolent and disgusting\u201d hate mail, said Khatib.\n\nBut the family\u2019s plight also prompted an outpouring of support, and on Thursday they announced the would reopen.\n\nHow Canada\u2019s far right is using anti-Muslim propaganda to target Trudeau Read more\n\nAt a press conference outside the restaurant, Husam Al-Soufi told reporters that the decision to close \u201ccame from a place of fear\u201d \u2013 but the outpouring of support had inspired the family to continue serving the city.\n\nMohamed Fakih, a Toronto-based businessman who has made a high-profile effort to hire Syrian staff at his restaurant chain, pledged to support the family\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to send a message that hate will never win in Canada,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice have now opened an investigation into the threats, the family has said.\n\nThe family felt like they had the strength to come back because of all the love and support they got,\u201d said Khatib. \u201cIn this case, the good is bigger than the bad.\u201d", "description": "Owners of popular Soufi\u2019s were targeted with hate mail and threats but family says wave of support inspired them to reverse decision", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba6ae298f883b184668370cc0e59c1567e0cddf/32_0_957_574/master/957.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5d75d998c414f048ec2efb665fb10254", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
