His latest effort is his most ambitious \u2014 and potentially his shortest run ever. It\u2019s called EPIC 6.0: Holosphere, and after years of development the multi-story, transparent LED sphere only saw one performance at Belgium\u2019s Tomorrowland festival. \u201cWhat a lot of people don\u2019t realize,\u201d Prydz tells me, \u201cis that even though they buy a ticket and they come to see the show and it\u2019s two hours, for us, it\u2019s been two years.\u201d\n\nThe Holosphere is Prydz\u2019s latest Eric Prydz In Concert (EPIC) show, a limited-run multi-sensory experience he and his team have been constantly developing for almost a decade. The show has grown dramatically over the years, and versions have included hundreds of laser beams, digital screens larger than a jumbo jet, and colossal holographic effects. They\u2019re breathtaking, but not practical, and production for The Holosphere is so large Tomorrowland had to redesign its grounds in order to accommodate it.\n\nIt\u2019s a passion project, says Prydz, since each iteration takes years of development, are only performed a few times, and he always loses \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201d If this seems impractical, it is, but Prydz is more interested in pushing the boundaries of what tech can create onstage than relying on decades-old crowd pleasers like pyrotechnics and confetti. \u201cWe wanted to use the technology that now is available that wasn\u2019t available then,\u201d Prydz says, \u201cand try and do something different and more exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I wish I was in the crowd\u201d\n\nAn unfortunate side effect of being at the literal center of his show is that Prydz has never seen EPIC himself. But to get a taste, he watches videos that are uploaded to social media after a show. \u201cThey upload these videos on YouTube,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich I love to watch afterwards ... Sometimes I wish I was in the crowd.\u201d\n\nPrydz hunting down EPIC clips and watching them in amazement actually demonstrates part of what\u2019s been driving upgrades and overhauls with stage production. As Rolling Stone wrote last year, show designers increasingly have to consider not just what a show looks like to an audience, but how it looks to the millions and millions of people reached online with every tweet, Instagram post, and snap. \u201cA show no longer starts when the curtain rises,\u201d said entertainment architect Ray Winkler to Rolling Stone. \u201cThe show starts the moment the first person takes a picture of it.\u201d\n\nAnother driving factor in stage innovation is the explosion of music festivals. As Quartz points out, this increase is in part because festivals have become more cost-effective than concerts. Multiple acts play on a single festival stage each day, effectively splitting the costs of things like lighting, sound, and crew. This can make festival tickets a bargain for music lovers, who can see lots of acts for one price. But if you\u2019re an artist playing a festival, how do you stand out when you share a stage with a dozen other acts? On the easier end, you might customize your visuals, or on the extreme end, you might build incredible props and light shows, like Daft Punk\u2019s legendary pyramid, Gesaffelstein\u2019s Vantablack monolith, or Prydz\u2019s multi-story Holosphere.\n\nA massive, transparent sphere is ambitious by anyone\u2019s standards\n\nA massive, transparent sphere is ambitious by anyone\u2019s standards, but the reveal at Tomorrowland paid off. The sphere\u2019s millions of LEDs completely obscured Prydz when fully lit up, displaying everything from blue, microbial circles to rocky, planetary forms and spinning robotic bodies. One of the most stunning visuals was when the sphere transformed into a giant eyeball frenetically darting about. Just months ago I had seen Prydz\u2019s team working on this very animation. Designer and VJ Liam Tomaszewski tested the idea by projecting it on a yoga ball in a small basement, while head of lighting Ross Chapple played around with different configurations of lasers and LED bars to flash around it. Now, here it was over two stories tall, with Tomaszewski and Chapple working live and in tandem to trigger the mind-blowing moment. Prydz stands in the center, visible through the eye\u2019s unlit iris. The eye holds for a moment, looming over the audience, before exploding into an acid green, robotic tangle of electricity.\n\nEric Prydz\u2019s Holosphere by the numbers 8 meters wide\n\n72 panels\n\n2.4 million LEDs\n\n223 different lengths of LED strips\n\n301 square meters of LED panels\n\n17,840 LED strips\n\n16 millimeter pixel pitch\n\n5 tons of weight\n\n150 individual laser diodes\n\n545 lighting fixtures\n\nWhile the first Holosphere performance went off without a hitch, Tomorrowland canceled the second one after part of the festival\u2019s stage ceiling sank. One of the troubles these massive EPIC shows face is designing for temporary festival stages, which generally support less weight than permanent venues, and this constraint is something that was considered when the sphere was designed. A spokesperson for Tomorrowland told The Verge that the festival was not able to \u201creconstruct the structure of the ceiling to Tomorrowland\u2019s standards,\u201d and so, \u201cunfortunately there is no time to build his Holosphere.\u201d\n\nPrydz\u2019s manager, Michael Sershall, called the Holosphere \u201ca tremendous success,\u201d but said that safety concerns prevented the show from being run again at Tomorrowland. \u201cThey had issues with the roof of the Freedom stage and ... decided to close the entire arena. We were absolutely devastated, especially as it was a situation beyond our control, but safety is always paramount,\u201d Sershall said in a statement.\n\nPrydz and his team are unsure if there will be other Holosphere performances in the future, but asking about its future might be beside the point. The Holosphere was only scheduled for these two Tomorrowland performances, and part of what makes EPIC shows so coveted is that they\u2019re all limited-run events. Even if it was only for one night, Prydz and his team accomplished their creative goal, wowing the Tomorrowland audience with an incredible spectacle that had never been done before. Now, it\u2019s all about what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201cEver since we started doing EPIC,\u201d Prydz says, \u201cour goal has always been to try and blow people away, but in a way that they haven\u2019t been blown away before at an electronic dance music event ... New technology will become available and we will figure out a way to incorporate that, and we will be able to do something that we haven\u2019t been able to do before.\u201d\n\nFor more on Prydz\u2019s Holosphere, check out The Verge\u2019s exclusive behind-the-scenes feature on how it was designed and built.
