His father, Bertrum, cried as he described the pain following the murder.\n\n\"How could we lose Botham - such a sweet boy? He tried his best to live a good honest life. He loved God. He loved everyone,\" he told the jury.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the sentence, Brandt said he wanted to speak directly to Guyger, and told her: \"If you truly are sorry, I know I can speak for myself, I forgive you.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't even want you to go to jail... I love you as a person. I don't wish anything bad on you\". After being allowed to hug her, they held each other in a long embrace.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Amber Guyger is escorted from the courtroom after being found guilty on Tuesday\n\nThe sentence, reached after an hour of deliberation, was decided by the same 12-member jury that had also found her guilty. She faced up to 99 years in prison.\n\nWhat happened during the trial?\n\nGuyger's lawyers had argued she was distracted by sexually suggestive texts with another police officer and had just completed a nearly 14 hour shift when she made \"a series of horrible mistakes\" on the night of 6 September 2018.\n\nImage copyright Police handout/ Facebook Image caption Amber Guyger (left) said she thought Botham Jean was an intruder in her own apartment\n\nProsecutors accused her of entering Jean's apartment \"commando-style\" and shooting at him while he was eating a bowl of ice cream on his sofa.\n\nGuyger had testified that she found the door unlocked, and noticed it open slightly when she pushed her key into what she said she thought was her apartment.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Jason Fine called her testimony \"garbage\" and said her actions were \"not a mistake\".\n\nBut the Texas Ranger who led the investigation testified it was common for residents at the complex where both Jean and Guyger lived to accidentally attempt to enter the wrong flat due to the building's design.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Guyger: \"I was scared whoever was in my apartment was going to kill me\"\n\nProsecutors said the off-duty police officer failed to recognise signs, such as Jean's distinctive red door mat, that she was standing outside the wrong flat.", "description": "Amber Guyger had been found guilty of murdering Botham Jean inside his own flat in Dallas in 2018.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pyd8w.jpg"}
