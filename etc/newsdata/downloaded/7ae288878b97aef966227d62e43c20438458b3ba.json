LOUIS \u2014 The Atlanta Braves are promising to continue their dialogue with the Native American community in the wake of Cardinals reliever Ryan Helsley\u2019s criticism of the Tomahawk Chop chant.\n\nHelsley told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch he thinks the chant is insulting, and the 25-year-old rookie was disappointed when it was heard during Game 1 of the NL Division Series against Atlanta.\n\nHelsley is a member of the Cherokee nation. The Tahlequah, Oklahoma, native speaks the Cherokee language and is one of only a few Native Americans in the majors.\n\nThe Braves say they \u201cappreciate and take seriously\u201d Helsley\u2019s concerns. The team says it has \u201cworked to honor and respect the Native American community through the years.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur organization has sought to embrace all people and highlight the many cultures in Braves Country,\u201d the team said Saturday in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate how we activate elements of our brand, as well as the in-game experience, and look forward to a continued dialogue with those in the Native American community once the season comes to an end.\u201d\n\nHearing the chant by the fans, a part of the Braves\u2019 tradition since it was borrowed from Florida State in the early 1990s, was a shock for Helsley.\n\nHelsley told the Post-Dispatch he was insulted by what he saw and heard in Thursday\u2019s series opener.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,\u201d Helsley said before the Braves\u2019 3-0 win in Friday\u2019s Game 2.\n\n\u201cJust depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren\u2019t intellectual. They are a lot more than that. It\u2019s not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and how we\u2019re perceived in that way, or used as mascots. The Redskins and stuff like that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Braves are promising to continue their dialogue with the Native American community in the wake of Cardinals reliever Ryan Helsley's criticism of the Tomahawk Chop chant.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/nlds_cardinals_helsleys_insult_baseball_82119_c0-267-4410-2838_s1770x1032.jpg?4227eadf574456c4d14b722b6dd0a9837c11f27d", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
