And their insatiable thirst threatens the region\u2019s water supplies, according to the OFDT.\n\nCritical grows in the dry summer, requiring heavy irrigation, while Beldiya is planted in winter, depending only on rainfall.\n\nSome locals complain that major producers enforce the planting of hybrids even in arid areas.\n\n\u201cThe traffickers impose it and the people don\u2019t have any other choice,\u201d says Mohamed Benyahya, a local community figure.\n\nTo water their plantations, major producers install solar pumps on the roofs of their mansions.\n\nNot far from Hicham\u2019s local cafe, a vast terraced cannabis plantation sprawls up a nearby mountain.\n\nRows of carefully maintained plants are watered by drip irrigation via a network of pipes connected to a reservoir.\n\n\u2013 To legalise, or not \u2013\n\nHybrids like Critical are notable also for high levels of THC, marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive chemical.\n\nThe adoption of hybrids explains the \u201crapid and significant increase in the average THC content\u201d of seized Moroccan hashish, according to the OFDT.\n\nFor smokers, the effect compared to Beldiya is pronounced. \u201cOne makes you think, the other makes you paranoid,\u201d says Mohamed, a friend of Hicham.\n\n\u201cEuropean consumers no longer want hybrid cannabis on account of its high THC levels,\u201d Mouna said.\n\n\u201cTraditional Moroccan cannabis remains highly coveted, particularly by advocates of legalisation.\u201d\n\nCannabis decriminalisation remains controversial in the conservative country.\n\nProposals to legalise cannabis have so far met fierce political opposition.\n\nFor Mouna, legalisation could help regulate cannabis consumption while also preserving the more traditional and environmentally friendly Beldiya.\n\nAnd, while Hicham may have switched to growing Critical, he still only smokes Beldiya.\n\n\u201cThe modern varieties,\u201d he says, \u201care mediocre.\u201d", "description": "Ketama (Morocco) (AFP) \u2013 Morocco\u2019s rugged Rif Mountains have long been renowned for their cannabis but traditional varieties are being smoked", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/b41154_morocco-traditional-cannabis-varieties-are-smoked-out-by-foreign-hybrids-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
