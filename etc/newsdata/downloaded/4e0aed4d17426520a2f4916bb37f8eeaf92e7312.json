He looks up directly into the home security camera, takes a few steps toward her before taking a last glance at the camera and extending his arm to shake the woman\u2019s hand.\n\nFootage then shows the man suddenly lunging at the realtor and violently pushing her over into a bush as she rolls onto the sidewalk screaming.\n\nKABC\n\nHe runs over to her while she is still on the ground and allegedly groped her chest, according to an interview she did with Fox 11 Los Angeles. He then fled the scene of the crime.\n\nThe victim, who asked the station not to identify her, said that she remembered seeing the same man at another open house a week before.\n\nShe became visibly nervous on the front step of the house when the man continued to ask her to take him back inside and grew increasingly frustrated with her refusals before the assault.\n\nFrank Bernardo, identified as team leader at Keller Williams Porter Ranch real estate agency on his Facebook page, released a statement on social media regarding the incident.\n\nKABC\n\n\"The agent is doing fine. She is really shook up. She is really upset \u2026 she has every right to be. So we take this extremely seriously in our office,\" Bernardo said. \"It was a female that was attacked but this is a serious situation for everybody.\"\n\nThe victim suffered an injured back and severe abrasions in the attack, according to KABC.\n\nEven though the man could be seen clearly in the home security footage, he is still on the run and the Los Angeles Police Department are asking the public for help in identifying him.", "description": "A real estate agent was attacked and allegedly sexually assaulted by a man during an open house in Encino, California over the weekend.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/realtor-assault-kabc-mo-20190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
