And the timing could hardly be better, with Ursula von der Leyen this week unveiling her team for the new European Commission \u2014 featuring a vice president for a European Green Deal.\n\nOur quartet of journalists from the EU's key capitals looks at von der Leyen's lineup (including some strange job titles) and asks: Just how green is Europe going to get under this new Commission?\n\nWe hear from Swedish Environment Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Isabella L\u00f6vin on her country\u2019s plan to become climate neutral by 2045. And POLITICO's environment reporter Paola Tamma catches up with Youth for Climate coordinator Adela\u00efde Charlier. With global protests planned to coincide with the U.N. Climate Summit on September 23, Charlier sets out what her peers want from politicians and answers criticism that their demands carry too high a price.\n\nOur financial reporter Bjarke Smith-Meyer explores whether the European Central Bank will assume a green hue under France\u2019s Christine Lagarde.\n\nAnd there's a bit of Brexit too, as our capital quartet stages its own version of Prime Minister's Questions to tackle the latest mysteries around Britain's delayed departure from the EU.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EU-Confidential-homepage-v1-green.png"}
