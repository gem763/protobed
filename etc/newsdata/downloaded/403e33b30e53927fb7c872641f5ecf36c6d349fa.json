He leads the Weiss Ratings team of analysts and computer programmers who created Weiss cryptocurrency ratings.\n\n___________\n\nOne year ago, we made a startling prediction: That today\u2019s banking system will be transformed, and potentially replaced, by the technology that powers cryptocurrencies.\n\nNow, key elements of that prediction are beginning to come true. So here\u2019s a refresh and update \u2026\n\nToday\u2019s banking system is an opaque web of intermediaries and third parties that stand between you and your money.\n\nMoreover, as I\u2019ll demonstrate in just a moment, they\u2019re gutting the income on your savings, while gouging you for interest on your borrowings.\n\nBut in today\u2019s modern financial system, you have no other choice. Without a bank or bank equivalent, it\u2019s extremely difficult to deposit your paycheck, use a credit card, make money transfers, or just write checks to pay your regular monthly bills.\n\nEven if you never shop online, there\u2019s no other way to fully participate in most modern economies.\n\nWhy? Because for any of these services, you first need a bank to digitize your money.\n\nThe banking industry monopolizes all the key digital functions: It converts your cash into digital form. It makes digital transactions on your behalf. And it converts your digital money back to cash.\n\nBut all at a huge, stealth cost to you!\n\nRight now, for example, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reports that U.S. banks pay savers an average annual yield of only 0.18%% on their money-market accounts. That\u2019s even lower than it was one year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the latest release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, year-over-year consumer price inflation is 1.70%. Worse, core inflation, which excludes gasoline prices, has just a hit a 13-month high of 2.4%.\n\nSo do the arithmetic: If you\u2019re an average U.S. saver, you get 0.18%, but you lose 2.4% to inflation. Your net yield is 2.22% below zero!\n\nThat\u2019s about twice as bad as it was one year ago!\n\nIt means that \u2026\n\nInstead of giving you a return on your savings, America\u2019s banks are charging you more than two full percentage points per year for your liquid money. Then, they invest your money as they see fit, taking 100% of the return.\n\nIf you think that\u2019s abusive, consider how much the average American consumer pays for borrowing money, especially via credit cards:\n\nAccording to Bankrate.com, the average interest rate on credit card balances is 17.77%, and that\u2019s before compounding! When you consider interest on interest, the overall yearly rate can quickly escalate beyond 30%.\n\nYour interest payments and other fees are then divvied up among multiple second and third parties, including banks, credit card issuers, payment processors and others. Plus, a big chunk of the money goes to cover credit card delinquencies and fraud.\n\nIn sum, you get the raw end of the deal from both sides \u2014 as a lender and as a borrower.\n\nThis is insane.\n\nWhat about the Great So-Called 'Fintech Revolution'?\n\nSure, it has created new efficiencies. But it has also helped \u2026\n\nSpawn the creation of more and more intermediaries \u2026\n\nOpen the door for many to merge or be bought out, and \u2026\n\nGive a handful of mega-institutions highly concentrated control over your money.\n\nMany of those same institutions have taken unprecedented risks with your savings, especially in the realm of big bets called \u201cderivatives,\u201d a primary culprit in the 2008 debt crisis.\n\nAccording to the latest report by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), U.S. banks hold USD 201 trillion in derivates contracts \u2014 leveraged bets on interest rates, foreign currencies, stocks, commodities and more.\n\nThat\u2019s insane.\n\nWorse, just four megabanks \u2014 Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Goldman Sachs \u2014 control a whopping 88.3% of that USD 201 trillion.\n\nThat\u2019s even more insane: A lot of money and a lot of risk in very few hands \u2014 the ultimate in centralization!\n\nAnd it\u2019s mostly with your money \u2026 for which you\u2019re getting less than nothing in interest.\n\nBeyond insanity!\n\nDLT-based financial system\n\nOne of the few ways to restore some sanity is a financial system based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). It\u2019s what we now call Distributed Finance, or DeFi.\n\nConsumers are king. Their money talks loudly. They retain direct control of their assets. And the burden is on financial institutions to produce safe, positive returns.\n\nIn a DLT-based system, financial institutions can still play an important role. But you always have the option to digitize your assets without them.\n\nIf any institution fails to give you an acceptable return, you have an alternative: You can readily take possession of your assets by transferring them to your personal wallet.\n\nIn this system, the concept of banks failing to compensate savers for the annual inflation rate is unthinkable. To survive, banks have no choice but to provide a fair return.\n\nBetter yet, a 2008-style meltdown is also hard to imagine. The diffusion of power and the diversity of participants would strongly militate against it.\n\nI repeat: Allowing consumers to digitize and retain possession of their own assets can greatly help restore sanity to the entire financial system.\n\nPeer-to-peer lending platforms are where this revolution has begun\n\nCryptocurrencies have sought to reinvent the way the financial system works by restoring direct possession, ownership and control of assets to the user.\n\nGood. But they miss a fundamental fact of life: The world economy is driven by credit formation.\n\nThis is why crypto critics argue that bypassing the banking system would be disastrous. If enough people began hoarding money in their digital wallets, they warn, credit markets would shrivel, and the global economy could collapse. True, but \u2026\n\nNo one in the crypto world advocates hoarding. Instead, in the world of DLT, credit markets are safer, and will one day be larger and more efficient.\n\nWhy? Thanks to peer-to-peer lending platforms, such as Compound or DyDx.\n\nImagine a kind of Facebook or other social media platform dedicated mostly or entirely to matching up appropriate borrowers and lenders.\n\nImagine all participants on this online platform obeying clear, transparent, strict and immediately enforceable rules of conduct, risk and reward \u2014 all built into smart contracts.\n\nAnd then imagine how many billions of people it could serve, how big it could grow and how beneficial it could be for the global economy.\n\nOur advice to banks: If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em!\n\nThere are three possible ways peer-to-peer lending platforms will evolve:\n\n\u2022 They could take business away from traditional banks, ultimately replacing many institutions.\n\n\u2022 They could evolve in parallel with banks, each side mostly restricted to its own sectors. For example, although both peer-to-peer lending platforms and banks can handle loans of all sizes, the former may be better equipped for large quantities of mini- and micro-loans, while the latter may be better able to handle the larger loans. We can see this today where the average loan on Ethereum\u2019s credit platforms is 1456 USD.\n\n\u2022 Or many banks could adopt these platforms and integrate them into their systems, charging a nominal transaction fee. They keep the customer. They focus on aggregating various categories of loans into portfolios. Plus, they provide money management, trust services and more. We\u2019re already seeing a number of crypto companies adopt this business model.\n\nWhich scenario will it be? Probably a mix of all three. But sooner or later, some bankers will realize that, if you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, you may as well join \u2019em.\n\nWhat we may wind up with is peer-to-peer lending platforms that are open to the broader public alongside banks and funds that analyze, categorize and aggregate loans into a wide range of portfolios. Or banks may try to co-opt the concept and create their own peer-to-peer lending facilities.\n\nNo matter what, credit and lending have been around for thousands of years and they\u2019re not going away. Healthy credit markets are a cornerstone of advanced civilizations. That\u2019s not going to change, either.\n\nThe main difference is that with DLT, although intermediaries can provide valuable services, they are no longer absolutely needed.\n\nThe benefits will be obvious \u2026\n\nBenefit #1. You regain direct control over your assets. Unless you voluntarily choose to entrust your money to a bank or a fund, only you control it, and nobody can gain access to it without your explicit permission. This alone helps greatly reduce three frightening trends that have had a big impact on recent economic history: The concentration of wealth control, the risk of black swan events and the likelihood of contagion.\n\nBenefit #2. Most of the interest paid by the borrower goes to you. Intermediaries can still make money. But if you\u2019re the one putting up the dough, you\u2019re the one entitled to get most of the return.\n\nBenefit #3. You don\u2019t give up so much of your returns to cover defaults and fraud. When it comes to sniffing out bad credit risks and bad actors, DLT-based smart contracts are likely to greatly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of credit reviews. This doesn\u2019t mean credit analysts and loan officers go away. But more of their time can be dedicated to helping engineers build smarter smart contracts or to perform higher levels of due diligence that smart contracts cannot cover.\n\nBenefit #4. Transparency. Even after you\u2019ve sent your money off to a borrower, it doesn\u2019t get lost in a maze of banking transactions. Like tracking your FedEx package, you can see exactly where your money is, who\u2019s got it, and what they\u2019re doing with it.\n\nRemember: A distributed ledger is an immutable record of true transactions. So you no longer have to rely on a financial institution\u2019s delayed reporting of summary numbers. Virtually all the detail you might want about your investment or loan is just a few clicks away. Even if the bank is still responsible for allocating credit, with DLT, it will do so in a more public and transparent manner.\n\nEthereum currently leads the way. So far.\n\nThe best example of the platform that\u2019s taken a clear leadership role in this area is Ethereum.\n\nWhat\u2019s exciting is that we\u2019re seeing more of these protocols emerge to the point where we can state that DeFi \u2014 especially decentralized lending platforms \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the cryptocurrency space. It\u2019s also one of the first real-world applications of smart contracts we\u2019ve seen to date.\n\nThese protocols are growing at an accelerated space, giving depth and complexity to the crypto markets that we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nThe best part is that the increased competition from DeFi platforms should give banks an incentive to sweeten the pot. They will be pressured to offer you better returns for your savings and lower rates on your loans.\n\nPlus, they should be able to give you access to platforms that let you lend your money to your choice of funds or individuals.\n\nJust remember that it\u2019s still very early in this game. A lot has to happen before this kind of transformation takes hold and becomes widespread. But it\u2019s precisely at a time like this when smart investors can get in at the lowest prices and make the most money.", "description": "One year ago, we made a startling prediction: That today\u2019s banking system will be transformed, and potentially replaced, by the technology that powers cryptocurrencies.\r Now, key elements of that prediction are beginning to come true.
