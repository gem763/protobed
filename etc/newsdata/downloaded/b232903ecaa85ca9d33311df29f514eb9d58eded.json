Fairfax County native and WRC alum Lindsay Czarniak will serve as the sideline reporter on the Fox broadcast alongside play-by-play man Sam Rosen and analyst Ronde Barber.\n\nThe game at Hard Rock Stadium is a double homecoming of sorts for Czarniak, whose sports broadcasting career began in South Florida in 2003. Czarniak was working as a news reporter in Jacksonville at the time, when a chance meeting at a NASCAR race led to job covering sports at Miami\u2019s WTVJ. One of her roles at the NBC affiliate over the next two years was hosting \u201cFins TV,\u201d a half-hour program that featured stories about Dolphins players\u2019 lives off the field.\n\nIn June 2005, Czarniak received a call from the late George Michael, who offered her the sports anchor and reporter position at WRC. She called D.C. home and covered the Redskins regularly for six years before leaving for ESPN.\n\n\u201cIf you had said then that I would be going back to cover the Dolphins and Redskins, it\u2019s just crazy,\u201d Czarniak, who handled sideline reporting duties for several Redskins preseason games during her tenure at WRC, said in a phone interview this week.\n\nA Centreville High School and JMU graduate who grew up rooting for the Redskins and still considers herself a fan, Czarniak said she wasn\u2019t surprised that Jay Gruden was fired on Monday after an 0-5 start.\n\n\u201cI feel the pain of the audience I\u2019m reporting to,\u201d said Czarniak, who couldn\u2019t be more happy about the accomplishments of her favorite baseball team, the Nationals, this postseason. \u201cI am excited about the change of identity and philosophy that it is clear the Redskins are taking into this week. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s a fresh start. I\u2019m fascinated to see what the commitment to the running game is going to look like under [interim coach] Bill Callahan. How many carries will Adrian Peterson have? Will it take them back to last year and result in more wins? This is the first glimpse that people will have into what this team could have the rest of the season and what\u2019s worth building on.\u201d\n\nIf Callahan doesn\u2019t retain his job after the season, Czarniak, who left ESPN in 2017 and joined Fox as a NASCAR reporter earlier this year, said she would like to see the Redskins make a run at Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin.\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s not likely to happen, but I just know what the fan base would react to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re in the bottom of the bucket, and what do you do? There are a lot of talented players on that team and I\u2019d like to see them make the most out of what they have. When I heard Tomlin as a rumor, as a Redskins fan I thought, he\u2019s a Super Bowl-winning coach that the players genuinely love who has proven himself, and I got a little excited.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nCase Keenum to start at quarterback for Redskins against the Dolphins\n\nFive keys for the Redskins against the Dolphins\n\nAdrian Peterson is re-energized by Bill Callahan\u2019s run-first game plan\n\nESPN\u2019s Scott Van Pelt: Daniel Snyder\u2019s Redskins are on \u2018a treadmill to nowhere\u2019\n\nBill Callahan wants the Redskins to focus on the run.
