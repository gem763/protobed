Mostly because a) Apple\u2019s default time lapse wallpapers felt a bit boring, and b) Live Photos I shoot with my phone aren\u2019t as interesting as some of the glitch art you can find online.\n\nThe process is very simple \u2014 you\u2019re basically converting a GIF into a Live Photo. It does take a few steps to get it to work just right. Bear with me, though. I promise it\u2019s worth it.\n\nGo to the Apple Store and download an app that lets you turn GIFs into Live Photos. You can use a popular app like Giphy which not only has a lot of GIFs available, but now has a built-in option to save its GIFs as Live Photos. You can, of course, also use your favorite GIF app.\n\nFind a GIF or a Live Photo you want to use as your Apple Watch wallpaper and save it to your Photos app.\n\nOnce you save the photo, go to your Photos library, select your newly saved Live Photo, and hit \u201cEdit\u201d in the top right corner.\n\nMake the last frame of the Live Photo your key photo.\n\nGo to the Watch app on your iPhone in order to create a new watchface based on a photo.\n\nSelect the second tab named \u201cFace Gallery,\u201d then scroll down until you reach the Photos section. Under \u201cContent\u201d select \u201cPhotos.\u201d That will enable you to pick a specific photo instead of a whole album. Pick your desired Live Photo there.\n\nLastly, add the watchface to your watch and test it out.\n\nNote that if the animation isn\u2019t working properly, it probably means that the animation is too long. In that case you can easily trim it using your favorite editing app.\n\nAlso, be aware that some GIFs will work better than the others. For example, as I played around with it, I found that Live Photos that have 42 frames, and GIFs with a lot more movement, like fireworks or lightning, all worked better for me.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it.
