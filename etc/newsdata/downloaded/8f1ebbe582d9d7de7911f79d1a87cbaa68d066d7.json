Pepper spray was deployed, followed later by tear gas at around 10pm. Tear gas was again fired in the same location a little more than an hour later.\n\nOne protester had earlier been subdued by officers and taken away, triggering a larger crowd and shouts of \u201crelease the man\u201d which echoed around King\u2019s Road.\n\nProtesters protect themselves after anti-riot police use pepper spray in Tai Koo.

They hurled verbal abuse to provoke the officers and threw dog food at them, asking them to pull down their masks. Calling officers \u201cdogs\u201d has been a long-standing insult during the anti-government movement.\n\nAfter a 90-minute stand-off, officers left to jeers and boos, followed by protesters who continued to hurl abuse.\n\nThe station was a flashpoint of the protests in August when police stormed it to arrest protesters who had set up positions there. The intensity of the police action, broadcast on television, led to police being confronted by angry residents of the residential estate.\n\nAt 10.20pm, the MTR said Kwun Tong station was closed after an incident, and trains would not stop there. Before the announcement, facilities were damaged, including a fire hose. Riot police arrived a few minutes after the closure and were heckled by residents from Yue Man Square outside the station. A second station, Tai Po Market, also was closed about 30 minutes later. Two other stations, Ngau Tau Kok and Tai Koo, were closed later in the evening.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday night, a crowd of about 300 masked protesters gathered at New Town Plaza shopping mall after 8pm. The group, including some in school uniform, took over the atrium of the mall. They sang protest songs, including Glory to Hong Kong , which has come to be regarded as Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cnational anthem\u201d of protest.\n\nAnti-riot police with a mask covering most of his face standing by inside Tai Koo Station.

A group spokesman said: \u201cWe are not afraid. The Carrie Lam regime can\u2019t frighten us off. The pro-government people like to boast that there are also anti-mask laws in overseas countries. It is laughable. Those are democratic countries. How can Hong Kong, a place where there is no democracy, compare with those countries?\u201d\n\nThe group urged protesters to continue to press the government to fulfil their five demands.\n\nSimilar peaceful protests also took place earlier in the evening in Landmark North in Sheung Shui, tmtplaza in Tuen Mun and Tai Po Mega Mall.\n\nIn Yoho mall, more than 200 black-clad masked protesters occupied the atrium of the mall and sang protest songs from 8pm. Afterward, they went to the front of Peking Garden restaurant, a chain under Maxim\u2019s Group, mocking diners. They stayed there for 15 minutes before leaving to cause further disturbance at the mall\u2019s food court, which they claimed was also run by Maxim\u2019s.\n\nNo mall security guards were seen intervening.\n\nProtesters targeted the restaurant group after Annie Wu, the daughter of its founder, recently voiced support for police use of tear gas to suppress the violent clashes.\n\nProtesters take to the streets after teen protester is shot during anti-government demonstrations\n\nElsewhere in Tsuen Wan, about 100 protesters rallied in the Sha Tsui Road Playground in Tsuen Wan in support of Tsang Chi-kin, 18, a student at a local secondary school \u2013 Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College \u2013 who was hit by a live round fired by riot police during violent clashes on October 1.\n\nA \u201cLennon Wall\u201d created at the college was filled with messages of support from dozens of alumni and neighbours for the Form Five student, who was in stable condition after surgery.", "description": "Other rallies against the proposed law took place in Sha Tin, Yuen Long, Kwun Tong and Tseung Kwan O", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/ab270cec-e5ea-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires072949.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
