A lot of the time those don't mesh as seamlessly as you might hope they would, so I'm not surprised by it. I understand the frustration and the tension.\"\n\nHis comments marked the first time that Lore has publicly addressed his relationship with Foran since Recode's Jason Del Ray reported in July on rising tensions between the two executives.\n\nLore went on to say that he has \"learned a ton\" working with Foran and that he appreciates the diversity of thought between them.\n\n\"I have much more appreciation for the store business and I think there's a real future with brick-and-mortar stores, specifically for Walmart,\" he said.\n\n\"That tension, I would argue, is actually good and it's not unhealthy in any way,\" he said. \"And we're aligned on the strategy going forward.\"\n\nIn response to a question about his tenure at Walmart, Lore said he plans to fulfill a commitment he made in 2016 to stay at Walmart for a full five years.\n\n\"I committed to the board and [Walmart CEO] Doug [McMillon] and said I would be there five years,\" he said. \"I'll be there five years.\"\n\nLore's five-year commitment ends in 2021.", "description": "\"I understand the frustration and the tension,\" Walmart.com CEO Marc Lore said on Monday regarding his relationship with Walmart US CEO Greg Foran.", "authors": ["Hayley Peterson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d76cb392e22af6b69788b84-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
