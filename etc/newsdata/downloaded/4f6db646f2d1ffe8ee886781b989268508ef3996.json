Nobody comes out of the womb needing to buy two seats on an airplane,\" Mahar said. \"We have gone to this weird place where fat is good. It's pointing out that fat is unhealthy. That's what's bad. Fat-shaming doesn't need to end, it needs to make a comeback. Some amount of shame is good.\"\n\nCorden told his audience on Thursday night that he felt obligated to \"say something about this,\" noting that he has a platform to do so and admitting that he himself is \"overweight.\"\n\n\"I've got to say that anytime that I've met Bill Maher in person, he's been nothing but pleasant and kind and nice, which is why I found it so surprising that he or anybody thinks that fat-shaming needs to make a comeback because fat-shaming never went anywhere,\" Corden said. \"I mean, ask literally any fat person.\"\n\nThe CBS star acknowledged that being overweight \"isn't good\" and pointed to his own struggles with losing weight, saying he's had \"good days and bad months.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not all as lucky as Bill Maher, you know. We don\u2019t all have a sense of superiority that burns 35,000 calories a day,\" Corden joked.\n\nCorden said Maher is \"working against his own cause,\" pointing out that fat-shaming leads to depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior \"like overeating.\"\n\n\"Fat shaming is just bullying, that's what it is. It's bullying,\" Corden continued. \"And bullying only makes the problem worse.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe London-born comedian challenged Maher's claim that Europe doesn't have a weight issue, referring to himself as \"Exhibit A.\" He also insisted that the issue is more \"complex\" than the HBO host portrayed it, pointing to poverty as a significant factor in the obesity epidemic in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI believe that Bill Maher\u2019s heart is in the right place \u2026 but in the meantime Bill, please hear me when I say this: While you\u2019re encouraging people to think about what goes into their mouths, just think a little harder about what comes out of yours.\u201d", "description": "It appears there's a new late-night TV\u00a0feud\u00a0as \"The Late Late Show\" host James Corden slammed \"Real Time\" host Bill Maher over recent remarks cheering on \"fat-shaming.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
