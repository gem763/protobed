Defense Secretary Mark Esper was scheduled to discuss the closely held details of the deal with President Donald Trump in a Sept. 3 meeting, according to senior administration officials. If Trump approves and a deal is struck, it could begin a withdrawal of some 5,400 U.S. troops, roughly a third of the present force, from five bases within 135 days.\n\nBut the deal doesn\u2019t ensure several crucial things, those familiar with the discussions tell TIME. It doesn\u2019t guarantee the continued presence of U.S. counterterrorism forces to battle al Qaeda, the survival of the pro-U.S. government in Kabul, or even an end to the fighting in Afghanistan.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kimberly Dozier", "Time.Com Pompeo-Afghanistan-Peace-Deal"], "top_image": ""}
