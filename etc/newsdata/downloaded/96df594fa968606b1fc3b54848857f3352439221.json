I saw her in the crowd, she was pretty emotional,\u201d said Sinckler, who was brought up on a tough south London estate.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A long, long journey. It\u2019s good to see my mum out here, I\u2019ve done her proud.\n\n\u201cOn a personal level it was very special. Something we work hard on in training and something I try to bring to the party is my ball-carrying ability. It was quite nice that it all fell into plan.\n\n\u201cI was knackered afterwards. I said to Owen \u2018take the minute-and-a-half for the conversion\u2019 because I needed the rest!. That was a tough, tough Test match. Now we move on to next week.\u201d\n\nFifteen minutes later and Sinckler was responsible for another key moment by ripping the ball from number eight Isi Naisarani as Australia launched a sustained assault.\n\n\u201cThey were pounding away for ages. Their forwards were coming hard, I saw an opportunity and I backed myself and luckily it came off. It was a big part of my game,\u201d Sinckler said.\n\n\u201cFair play to Australia, that was hard graft, especially the first 20 minutes. They came out of the blocks flying and some of their forwards ran really, really hard.\n\n\u201cIt was testament to us as a team and one of our biggest things is togetherness and how tight we are as a squad.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve consciously worked on for the past few months and you saw it today.\n\n\u201cSticking to the plan, sticking to the process, always having belief in ourselves, belief in our coaches.\n\n\u201cAfter their try we stepped up the gears on our defence and our attack and we got the result.\u201d\n\nThe scrum was a key battleground in which both teams enjoyed victories and defeats.\n\nOne series of reset scrums early in the match ended with Australia hooker Silatolu Latu patting Sinckler on the head in an attempt to wind him up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve really tried to own....my discipline and just being cool in the moment and that comes with experience,\u201d said the tighthead, who is known for his combustible temperament.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have good scrums and bad scrums, or scrums where you don\u2019t agree with the decision. It\u2019s Test match rugby so you just have to get on with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always going to be that way, especially when you\u2019re at tighthead. You get the rub of the green sometimes and other times you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAustralia have improved a lot in their scrum and our job as a front row was to keep going at them, keep going at them.\n\n\u201cEvery scrum, don\u2019t take a backwards step, no matter what the refereeing decision was. You saw in the end that we got our reward. We took their legs away.\n\n\u201cFair play to Australia, they have improved a lot in that area but as an England pack we pride ourselves on our scrum.\u201d", "description": "Kyle Sinckler declared he had done his mum proud by scoring the try that swept England out of danger and into the World Cup semi-finals at Australia\u2019s expense.
