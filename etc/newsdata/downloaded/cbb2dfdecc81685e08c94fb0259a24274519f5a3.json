In 2020, the company said it expect to sell $5 billion to $10 billion of non-strategic assets to help pay down debt.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nMeanwhile, for the third quarter of 2019, AT&T\u2019s pay-TV business continued to be in free-fall, crimping revenue and hurting the bottom line. WarnerMedia revenue in the third quarter dropped 4.4% on a tough comparison with Warner Bros.\u2019s stronger theatrical slate in the year-earlier period.\n\nThe telco said it expects chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson to remain chief executive through at least the end of 2020. In addition, the company said it will add one new director after its next regular board meeting who will be a \u201ctechnology executive with experience executing strategic cost initiatives\u201d followed by another director in 2020, which were among the concessions to assuage Elliott\u2019s concerns.\n\nStephenson said AT&T\u2019s board has not officially reached a decision about his retirement as CEO but noted he\u2019s been in the role for 11 years and the board has been engaged in a leadership succession plan. Also, the role of chairman and CEO will be split after Stephenson exits as chief exec, another measure Elliott had called for.\n\n\u201cThe objectives we have outlined today have been central to our plans for many months, even before we closed our acquisition of Time Warner,\u201d Stephenson said in a statement. \u201cBut, as you would expect, our thinking has also benefited from our engagement with our owners, including Elliott Management. I\u2019ve found our engagement with Elliott to be constructive and helpful, and I look forward to continuing those conversations.\u201d\n\nLast month, Elliott Management urged AT&T to refocus on its core business, criticizing its massive deals for Time Warner and DirecTV as inhibiting its financial performance.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Elliott Management\u2019s Jesse Cohn and Marc Steinberg commended the AT&T plan, saying the new steps \u201cwill create substantial and enduring shareholder value at one of America\u2019s greatest companies\u2026 It is clear to us that AT&T is committed to and accountable for creating shareholder value over the near- and long-term.\u201d\n\nOverall, AT&T\u2019s consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $44.59 billion, below analyst consensus estimates of $45 billion and down 2.5% year over year. Net income dropped 18% to $3.95 billion; that translated into Q3 adjusted earnings per share of 94 cents (vs. consensus analyst estimates of EPS of 93 cents).\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, AT&T dropped a net 1.16 million premium TV video subscribers, including at DirecTV, while its over-the-top AT&T TV Now service dropped 195,000 net customers, for a total net loss of 1.36 million video subs. The company attributed about 225,000 of those losses to programming blackouts. As of the end of the period, AT&T had 21.6 million total video customers, which included 1.1 million AT&T TV Now subscribers \u2014 down 3.6 million from 25.2 million a year earlier.\n\nStephenson noted that Q3 is historically weak for the pay-TV business on the call with investors, and he promised significant improvement in pay-TV numbers in Q4 with subscriber trends getting better moving into next year. The DirecTV satellite business continues to provide strong free cash flow but Stephenson said the recently debuted internet-delivered AT&T TV service will become the standardized, primary go-to-market television offering and HBO Max will \u201cbecome the workhorse\u201d for the video business.\n\nWarnerMedia Q3 2019 operating revenue was $7.8 billion, down 4.4%, dragged down by a 10.4% decline at Warner Bros. with the company citing \u201ca more favorable mix of box office releases in the prior comparable period\u201d (which included \u201cAquaman\u201d and \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d) as well as lower TV licensing. HBO revenue was up 10.6% to $1.8 billion, and Turner revenue of $3.0 billion was up 0.6%.", "description": "AT&T announced a three-year capital allocation plan aimed at addressing concerns of an activist investor, under which the company said it will continue to sell off pieces of the business to get its balance sheet in shape.
