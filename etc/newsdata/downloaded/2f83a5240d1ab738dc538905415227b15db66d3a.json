Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau did not introduce her husband, as planned (and as she did in 2015,) staying instead in the background while Trudeau appeared in a bulletproof vest under his blazer.\n\nNothing Trudeau has done in the past four years justifies a threat to his life, or that of his family, as everyone, even his election rivals, were quick to point out afterward. The Liberal leader spoke on Sunday of the \u201cpolarized\u201d political climate that creates situations like the one he faced, in which he, in four years, has become a polarizing figure.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\n\u201cI am concerned in general with the polarization that we\u2019ve seen in this election,\u201d Trudeau told reporters. \u201cWe have seen this in our friends and allied countries around the world, where increased divisive discourses, misinformation, deliberate misleading of electors has led to some very toxic elections.\u201d\n\nIn that context, Trudeau is correct. Four years ago, there was no Donald Trump in the White House, the Brexit vote hadn\u2019t happened and Canadians were talking in the midst of an election campaign about how to make this country more welcome to immigrants and refugees.\n\nHow exactly has this happened in Canada in general, then, and Trudeau in particular? More pointedly, what changed between Brampton, circa 2015, and Mississauga on Saturday night?\n\nNo prime minister, in recent memory at least, has experienced such a drastic, public mood swing between elections. All successful leaders accumulate some baggage between their first election and their next try at re-election, but the backlash against Trudeau in this campaign seems particularly vicious.\n\nWhat makes it even more curious is that the nastiest attacks are focused on who Trudeau was before he became prime minister \u2014 almost as if his opponents have stored up material that failed to work in 2015, when all of the \u201cnot ready\u201d ads and ridicule against the Liberal leader bounced off a seemingly bulletproof public image.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nAfter last week\u2019s French-language leaders\u2019 debate, representatives of right-wing publications lined up first at the media microphones to grill Trudeau about ugly slurs circulating with regard to his personal past as a teacher in B.C. There\u2019s no need to dignify the slurs by spelling them out again here; the Star\u2019s Marco Oved did a thorough forensic analysis last week of the manufactured smear campaign, which nonetheless lived on at the postdebate scrums.\n\nTo be clear: ugly rumours circulated about Stephen Harper and his personal life all the time he was prime minister too \u2014 Ottawa reporters were repeatedly peppered with \u201ctips\u201d about the alleged breakup of the Harper marriage (which still endures, by the way.) Brian Mulroney, in his late, unpopular years in office, was alleged to be drinking on the job (also very untrue.)\n\nBut as far as I can recall, none of this dark side of political gossip turned up at a media microphone for any prime minister.\n\nGet The Lead newsletter Start getting your whip-smart guide to Canada's 2019 federal election in your inbox.

This isn\u2019t good. As an Uber driver said to me the other day after watching the leaders\u2019 debates \u2014 this isn\u2019t Canada. (The driver, an immigrant from Haiti, said he\u2019s always liked Canadian politics because we are more polite about our differences than American politics. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s always been true, but it is easier to be more polite than Donald Trump these days.)\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Mississauga rally on Saturday night was never going to be what Brampton was on Oct. 4, 2015. But the stark difference between the two events \u2014 from the picture of hope to the spectre of fear \u2014 is a regrettably retrograde step in our politics, regardless of your political stripe. Maybe it\u2019s harder for Trudeau to say now that better is always possible, but Canada should be better than this.\n\nSusan Delacourt is the Star\u2019s Ottawa bureau chief and a columnist covering national politics.
