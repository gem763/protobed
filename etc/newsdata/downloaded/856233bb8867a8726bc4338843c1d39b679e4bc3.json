He grips the teen close, passing the weapon off to another man who sprints up to help.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen, Lowe wraps the student in a hug.\n\nFor a few seconds, the student seems to try to pull away, stepping back and pushing at the coach\u2019s shoulders. But Lowe holds on tightly. Eventually, the embrace is returned.\n\nIt lasts nearly half a minute. The men are still locked together as they move out of the security camera\u2019s view.\n\nGranados-Diaz had been suicidal for months leading up to the encounter, according to the Multnomah County district attorney. The high school senior was lonely after breaking up with his girlfriend, Oregon Live reported, citing friends and classmates.\n\nHe planned to commit suicide at school so that his mother would not discover his body, his defense attorney, Adam Thayne, told a judge last week, according to Oregon Live. He went to Parkrose on May 17 with a shotgun holding just one round, marked with the words, \u201cThe last red pill 5-17-19 just for me.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFate had something else in store for him,\u201d Thayne said.\n\nSchool officials had already gotten wind of Granados-Diaz\u2019s troubled state of mind, according to the district attorney. A student had told the administration of Granados-Diaz\u2019s \u201csuicidal statements;\u201d Lowe set out May 17 to bring the teenager into the school office.\n\nGranados-Diaz was \u201cvisibly upset\u201d as he headed for the classroom where Lowe had just showed up while searching for him, the district attorney said. Granados-Diaz pulled the firearm from beneath a long coat, authorities say, as teachers and students fled.\n\nGranados-Diaz turned the gun on himself and tried to fire, according to the district attorney \u2014 but the weapon did not discharge.\n\nAD\n\nLowe made sure Granados-Diaz didn\u2019t get another chance.\n\nIn May, Lowe described an \u201cemotional\u201d moment with Granados-Diaz, saying that after he took the gun, \u201cit was just me and that student.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was emotional for him, it was emotional for me,\u201d he said, according to local news station KATU. \u201cIn that time, I felt compassion for him. A lot of times, especially when you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing until it\u2019s over.\"\n\nLauded as a hero, Lowe tweeted that he took his jobs at Parkrose \u201cto guide and coach young people whose shoes [he] had once been in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen confronted with the test the universe presented me with, I didn\u2019t see any other choice but to act,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThank God, I passed. I\u2019ve spent the last 24 hours being more appreciative of my family and realizing we have a serious problem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLowe has not tweeted about the new surveillance footage, and he did not respond immediately to an inquiry Saturday. But video of his intimate moment with Granados-Diaz \u2014 released by the district attorney Friday in response to a public records request \u2014 has drawn a new wave of praise online.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is love and courage,\u201d one person said.\n\n\u201cA cry for help that was answered,\u201d said another. The district attorney says Granados-Diaz brought the gun to school in a \u201cmental health crisis.\u201d\n\nGranados-Diaz, now 19, pleaded guilty last week to unlawful possession of a loaded firearm in public, the district attorney said in a statement. He was sentenced to 36 months of probation, which includes mental health and substance abuse treatment.\n\nAD\n\nThe Post was unable to reach Granados-Diaz, and his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cHe is deeply remorseful for the pain that he has caused his family, his friends and the community,\u201d Thayne reportedly told the presiding judge, adding that Granados-Diaz \u201chas a lot of people who care about him, despite what he thought back in May.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The former Oregon Ducks football star was praised as a hero earlier this year.
