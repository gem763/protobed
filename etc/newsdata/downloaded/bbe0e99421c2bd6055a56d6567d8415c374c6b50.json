Nevertheless, they need to take time from their busy schedules to resolve, to Britain\u2019s satisfaction, the issue of a U.S. citizen who left that key ally after allegedly causing the death of a 19-year-old Briton in a traffic accident Aug. 27. She departed after the U.S. Embassy asserted diplomatic immunity on her behalf.\n\nThe United States should be sensitive to abuses of diplomatic immunity in such cases. In Washington 22 years ago, the No. 2 official of the Republic of Georgia\u2019s embassy struck and killed a Maryland teenager while driving drunk through downtown. Police initially released him from custody because of his diplomatic status, but the Clinton administration asked Georgia to waive the rules that ordinarily shield embassy personnel from prosecution in U.S. courts. Georgia complied \u2014 and the official pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and other charges, receiving a sentence of seven to 21 years in prison. He served three years before being transferred home and released.\n\nDetails of the current case are far different, to be sure. There is no claim that the motorist \u2014 identified by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson as Anne Sacoolas, wife of a government employee at a U.S. air base in England \u2014 was drunk, or that the victim, Harry Dunn, died as the result of anything other than an unintentional act. While riding a motorcycle, Dunn was struck head-on by a car using the wrong lane, an all-too-frequent mistake by foreigners unaccustomed to Britain\u2019s left-side driving rules. The driver apparently cooperated with police to some extent before leaving the country. Yet the British still seek a formal in-custody interview with Ms. Sacoolas, so as to complete their investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what level of immunity the U.S. Embassy in London applied. The Georgian official, Gueorgui Makharadze, was entitled to a blanket exemption from any charges because of his high official status. Lower-ranking officials generally enjoy functional immunity, which applies only to conduct related to their work. U.S. officials must of course avoid setting any precedents that might unduly hamper the legitimate prerogatives of those who work for the government under often difficult circumstances overseas. A State Department statement notes that it \u201crarely\u201d waives immunity. In previous cases, U.S. government personnel accused of causing deaths overseas escaped prosecution under diplomatic immunity, notably a contractor in Pakistan in 2011 and a military attache in 2018. Pakistan\u2019s dysfunctional criminal-justice system probably influenced U.S. thinking in those cases.\n\nBritish justice, however, is transparent. U.S. citizens can expect fair treatment there. At the very least, the Trump administration owes Britain a full and persuasive explanation of the decision to let the person allegedly responsible for Dunn\u2019s death to leave before British authorities had finished their investigation. If there isn\u2019t one, the administration should send her back.", "description": "The U.S. shouldn\u2019t shelter a woman who allegedly killed a British teen.", "authors": ["Editorial Board", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hHJ7yXrHjbLi-vnwsOv70tOwOH4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PIJFXRHKDEI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
