It was only a second run for the mount of Sean Levey since he finished a 66-1 second to Magna Grecia in the 2,000 Guineas in May.\n\nThat had been easy to dismiss as a fluke, but on Saturday Hannon proved to the world his faith in King of Change was not misplaced. Magna Grecia floundered 30 lengths behind.\n\nHannon said: \u2018Perhaps people thought I was a little petulant after not celebrating being second in the 2,000 Guineas but we have always thought the world of this horse.\n\nStradivarius was hauled back and beaten a nose by Kew Gardens in the Long Distance Cup\n\n\u2018People don\u2019t remember you finishing second in the Guineas but they\u2019ll remember him now. We gave him the summer off because he had a hard race in the Guineas.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not going to lie, I thought he\u2019d win or go very close. It will be a shorter winter off the back of this win and we\u2019ll be thinking about races like the Queen Anne Stakes (at Royal Ascot) next year.\u2019\n\nDettori has had a great season but will still reflect on some close shaves. Just like Enable in the Arc, Stradivarius looked the winner a furlong out. But Kew Gardens dug deep to provide the first of a big double for jockey Donnacha O\u2019Brien, who was later successful on Magical in the feature Champion Stakes. Both are trained by his father Aidan.\n\nO\u2019Brien jnr was making hay while Ryan Moore was in Australia.\n\nMagical, three-quarter of a length winner from Addeyyb, has run nine times this season and may not have finished yet, with O\u2019Brien eyeing the Breeders\u2019 Cup.\n\nO\u2019Brien snr said: \u2018She\u2019s the ultimate racehorse. Every morning she wakes up and says \u201cwhat do you want me to do today?\u201d.\u2019", "description": "In a rarity for 2019, Frankie Dettori was not centre stage as the star of Qipco British Champions day was Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner King of Change.", "authors": ["Marcus Townend For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19937772-0-image-a-6_1571520347555.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
