Yet the country is wedged between two elephants \u2014 China and the United States \u2014 and doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk about it. And Canada\u2019s party leaders, with the exception of the minor party leader Maxime Bernier, who paid for billboards with the slogan \u201cSay NO to mass immigration,\u201d have tended to minimize immigration as a campaign issue.\n\nThat may be smart economics, but it underplays the sense of unease on the topic expressed by voters in POLITICO polling. After all, it takes only one look at Brexit to see how avoiding immigration as a political topic can blow up in the face of establishment parties.\n\nBoth parties have missed the boat when it comes to engaging young Canadians. Millennials are the biggest pool of potential voters in this election, but their main political engagement in 2019 has been hitting the streets in massive climate strikes. The youth climate campaign didn\u2019t endorse candidates, run registration drives or mobilize voters.\n\nYoung Canadians obviously care, but don\u2019t appear to see electoral politics as a means of shaping their future.\n\nIs it any wonder? Trudeau wants to build oil pipelines and meet his Paris Climate Agreement targets, but won\u2019t explain how he can do both. \u201cThe point is right now, we need to get elected,\u201d Environment minister Catherine McKenna told Macleans. \u201cIf we are re-elected we will look at how best to do this.\u201d\n\nThat approach doesn\u2019t cut it with most millennials.\n\nWhen POLITICO showed up at a free big-screen election debate viewing party Oct. 7 at an Odeon cinema complex in Ottawa\u2019s southern suburbs, it was a youth-free zone. The complex is a prime hangout for young locals, but they were in other theaters: by the debate kick-off a lone elderly couple had wandered in.\n\nIf you want political fireworks, Canada is the wrong place to look. Canadian magnate Conrad Black wrote recently of the Prime Minister and his Conservative party rival: \u201cJustin Trudeau and Andrew Scheer are among the most amiable and naturally likable party leaders I have met.\u201d\n\nNice doesn\u2019t mean transparent, though. Neither of the biggest parties \u2014 the Liberals and Conservatives \u2014 is headed for a majority government, according to opinion polls. But good luck getting a straight answer from who they\u2019d prefer to work with in a minority or coalition government.\n\nLeader of the Conservative Party of Canada Andrew Scheer speaks to supporters during a campaign stop on Saturday in Brampton, Canada. | Cole Burston/Getty Images\n\nCanada is allergic to coalition governments (the last one formed in 1917), though these are common arrangements in Parliamentary government systems. When the New Democratic Party hinted it might form a coalition with the ruling Liberals, its leader Jagmeet Singh back-pedaled almost immediately.\n\nTelevised debates would be a good forum to test candidates on what other governing arrangements might work. The Liberal government of Trudeau even created an official Leaders\u2019 Debates Commission to facilitate more debates. So it\u2019s a shame Trudeau undercut his own Commission by agreeing to only one official debate in each language.\n\nOn the global level, Canada\u2019s complacency continues.\n\nOpposition leader Scheer, for example, wants to cut foreign aid yet also hopes to win a seat for Canada on the U.N. Security Council. The government for its part was a virtual no-show at the United Nations General Assembly in September.\n\nCanada\u2019s two biggest parties have failed individually and collectively to articulate how Canada should position itself between an erratic U.S. and a punitive China. Canada\u2019s export-driven economy has helped avoid the tide of rising protectionism and nativism via trade deals with Europe and Pacific Rim countries, but what now?\n\nScheer goes so far as to rule out pursuing a trade deal with China, and has no plans for non-economic partnerships with the world\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nIf China policy was bipartisan it wouldn\u2019t need to be an election issue: the parties could wing it behind closed doors. Because the parties are split and do not discuss it in any detail on the campaign trail, whoever forms the next government will enjoy the thinnest of China mandates.\n\nMichael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, says that doesn\u2019t work as a China strategy. A middle power like Canada needs a clear and consistent position to have any impact. Even with full bipartisan support, it took Australia 10 years to seal its China trade deal in 2015, \u201cin a different era, when it was much easier to separate the economics from the politics.\u201d\n\nAdded together, Canada\u2019s federal election has resolved little about where the country should head. Trudeau lost his shine, while Scheer never developed any. Whoever forms the next government, that dynamic condemns either leader to muddle through.\n\nYet as Canadians are fond of saying about this election, nodding in the direction of their southern neighbor, it could be worse.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8e/17/e063a887407cad061358442e889c/20191020-trudeau-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
