REUTERS/Tatyana Makeyeva\n\nSAP, the world\u2019s leading provider of enterprise applications ranging from finance to supply-chain logistics, is pushing to offer more cloud-based services via subscription as it winds down its old license-based model.\n\nYet customers in Germany, which accounts for 15% of total sales, say SAP is not providing enough guidance on how to execute their digital strategy, while upgrading to its premium cloud database, S/4HANA, remains challenging.\n\n\u201cSAP must provide an out-of-the-box solution without customers having to do their own development work,\u201d Marco Lenck, head of the German-speaking SAP User Group (DSAG), told its annual congress in Nuremberg.\n\nPresenting the results of a survey of DSAG members, Lenck said only a quarter felt well informed by SAP about digital strategy; 45% partly so; while 30% lacked confidence in SAP\u2019s guidance.\n\nChief Operating Officer Christian Klein, responding in a keynote address, said SAP was working to make its concept of the joined-up \u2018intelligent enterprise\u2019 a reality for customers.\n\nSAP will this year deliver an out-of-the-box version of S/4HANA integrated with human resources application SuccessFactors, as well as with the SAP Analytics Cloud and digital marketing tool Qualtrics.\n\nNext year applications covering vendor management, marketing, sales performance management, procurement and travel management will be fully integrated.\n\nEFFICIENCY DRIVE\n\nThe blunt customer feedback comes after SAP CEO Bill McDermott called time on a series of acquisitions that critics said left Europe\u2019s most valuable technology company saddled with a collection of apps rather than a genuinely integrated proposition.\n\nMcDermott launched a restructuring in January to let go of 4,400 people, and followed up in April by announcing an efficiency drive to expand operating margins by 5 percentage points through 2023.\n\nThat announcement, which coincided with the disclosure of an investment by activist investor Elliott, boosted SAP\u2019s shares to a record high.\n\nYet weaker second-quarter results raised fresh doubts that the strategy overhaul was on track, and SAP shares are trading 14% below their July peak.\n\nThe DSAG said the company needed to offer better integration; unified data standards; broader and more stable functionality; and more scalable solutions.\n\nInstallations of the S/4HANA database were going slowly, it added, while SAP\u2019s C/4HANA marketing suite was clunky and less popular than rival brands.\n\n\u201cWe need a business model for scalable performance and costs,\u201d said DSAG\u2019s Lenck. \u201cThat\u2019s what distinguishes cloud solutions. That\u2019s what the market offers. And that\u2019s what we expect from SAP.\u201d", "description": "Business software group SAP should be more responsive in meeting the needs of its customers as they make the transition to the digital era, the user community in its home market Germany said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430767736&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0KY", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
