His affable disposition was replaced by an undeniable edginess, a distinct snarkiness and a noticeable defiance in what feels like his final stand.\n\nBut can you blame him?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nGruden has weathered six seasons with the Redskins \u2014 longer than any other Dan Snyder-hired head coach \u2014 and has somehow led a near-.500 team (or better) the past four seasons, despite ongoing organizational dysfunction and the absence of a healthy franchise quarterback he believes in. And now, Gruden finds himself forced to choose between a hobbled journeyman, who only yesterday was wearing a walking boot, a promising rookie who needs to be developed, and a veteran he has an affinity for, but who can\u2019t stay healthy.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nThere\u2019s reason to be concerned about the growth of first-round pick, Dwayne Haskins. But there\u2019s another sympathetic figure entangled in the Redskins\u2019 QB carousel: Gruden.\n\n\u201cIn my mind I have a pretty good plan, contrary to belief,\u201d Gruden dryly said on Wednesday, when peppered by questions about who he plans to start Sunday against New England.\n\nWashington Redskins head coach Jay Gruden watches the game against the New York Giants during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Sept. 29, 2019, in East Rutherford, N.J. The Giants defeated the Redskins 24-3. (AP)\n\nThe 2019 season is only weeks old and Washington\u2019s season is essentially over. They\u2019re 0-4. Gruden is on the hot seat. And the organization is no closer to knowing what it has in Haskins.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd, with a matchup against the Patriots on deck, Gruden is determined to exhaust every option (i.e., ensuring Colt McCoy is healthy enough to play) before he turns the offense over to the rookie again.\n\nGruden is determined to win his way, with the quarterback he feels gives them the best chance to win \u2014 not the one who was drafted 15th overall in April. It\u2019s a stance that may ultimately backfire and expedite his undoing, but after six years of making do with an assortment of less-than-desirable options, can you blame him?\n\nHe inherited Robert Griffin III.\n\nHe never believed Kirk Cousins was capable of being The Guy.\n\nHe welcomed the arrival of veteran leader and beloved locker room guy, Alex Smith. Then watched helplessly as Smith\u2019s leg was broken into pieces last season.\n\nHe was forced to contend with Josh Johnson and Mark Sanchez after both Smith and McCoy were injured.\n\nAnd then this past spring \u2014 entering a make-or-break sixth season on the job \u2014 he was handed Case Keenum and a rookie quarterback he knew would need ample time to adjust to calling plays in the huddle and adapting to the speed of the game.\n\n\u201cYou would love to have some continuity there, some consistency there,\u201d Gruden said Wednesday, referring to their quarterback situation. \u201cUnfortunately, we have not had that luxury here in awhile. Until we get that luxury, until we start to have that, that\u2019s probably when you\u2019ll see some different results.\n\n\u201cI feel good about all three quarterbacks and they all bring something different to the table. We\u2019ve just got to settle on one and get him ready to go. When that guy gets his opportunity they have to take advantage of it and dominate the position and never look back.\u201d\n\nOn one hand, his head-coaching tenure (including his 35-48-1 regular-season record) doesn\u2019t instill much faith that he\u2019s capable of leading a team to a Super Bowl. Plus, Gruden\u2019s less-than rigorous practices and lack of overall team discipline have been mentioned repeatedly by players, on- and off-the-record, over the years. But how many coaches could handle everything that comes with being the front man in Washington. Dysfunction at the highest level \u2014 Snyder\u2019s sad attempts to rebrand the Redskins as a respectable franchise and Bruce Allen\u2019s track record of mismanagement and free-agent miscalculations \u2014 have only helped to compound one of the Redskins\u2019 most glaring issues: their never-ending search for a long-term quarterback.\n\nBy Thursday, Gruden still had not yet declared his Week 5 starter, although it\u2019s widely assumed McCoy will face the Patriots, if healthy. A formal announcement isn\u2019t needed to see that Gruden\u2019s current focus \u2014 winning games \u2014 doesn\u2019t align with the fan base\u2019s desire to see what Haskins can do. Sticking with McCoy or reverting back to Keenum may also be an unpopular move in the eyes of his bosses, who were higher on Haskins than Gruden on draft night.\n\nWell-run organizations arm their coaches with talent, as well as the freedom to deploy personnel and run their teams the way they see fit. In order for Washington to resemble the great teams of the past, management and its head coach must, at the very least, be on the same page and eyeing the same goals.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve come to realize, the Redskins are anything but a well-run franchise.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Dan Snyder has put Jay Gruden in an impossible situation in Washington.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/11_v.YcOYsmE_hzR4217fQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NcQHHpNvNVK_sR7ja6OQbg--~B/aD0xNTk2O3c9MjM5NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/2c1a9250-e628-11e9-876d-9e2d0f21b8ca", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
