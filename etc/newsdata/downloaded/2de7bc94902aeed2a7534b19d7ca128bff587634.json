We didn\u2019t invent it but in the modern era we\u2019ve expanded its use and application especially with new technologies and social media.\n\nRadio had the most reach for decades and still is an incredibly powerful communication medium. The rise of conservative talk radio demonstrates that, more often than not, opinion supported by facts will win the broadcast day.\n\nThe attempted rise of liberal talk radio has fallen flat in America. There are many examples of failed platforms like Air America, Pacifica Radio and even taxpayer-funded operations like NPR and other forms of public radio.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTelevision is a relatively new invention and for many we can now visualize while an opposing point of view is destigmatize or demonize. Just more proof that anything can be used for good or bad or some combination of both.\n\nThe internet and any of its many platforms is the new battleground. Nobody dies in a computer crash, but careers can die on the internet. Social media has given rise to anonymous capability and while, like any tool, it can be used for good information to be shared, it is too often used just for destructive purposes and anonymous vitriol.\n\nIn recent days we have seen so many examples of opinion being pushed aside for all-out vitriol against the president. It\u2019s no longer enough to disagree, but the aim is now to destroy by any means necessary, even at the expense of other liberals. This is not new, but the levels of vitriol now allow for outright lying and fantasyland scenarios.\n\nAn MSNBC host and panel ran with an example of how you can impeach Vice President Pence, make a deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiEx-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown Former George W. Bush chief of staff endorses Trump impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Calif.) to be vice president, impeach President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump campaign slams Minneapolis mayor, Target Center for 'attempting to extort' them with rally security fees Susan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report MORE and get President Pelosi. There was a time when this wouldn\u2019t have even made it past the first few words before being shut down.\n\nJust a basic question for Democrats and those who disagree with Trump: Are you willing to destroy former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown MORE or anyone necessary to get to Trump?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven Republican presidential candidates such as former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford Marshall (Mark) Clement SanfordTrump campaign takes steps to ensure critics are not represented at 2020 convention Sunday shows - Second whistleblower grabs spotlight Sanford: 'I don't know' if I would vote for Trump in 2020 MORE suggests there could be an economic collapse and a financial storm, the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen, as he talks about his primary challenge to Trump.\n\nTo him and the never Trumpers: Do any of these Democratic contenders get you closer to your Republican goals?\n\nSo where does this lead us as a nation and culture? Society is under assault and widely accepted social norms have been too often pushed aside. Good behavior can coexist with the anonymity of avatars. If the avatar is negative and reflects who you are, then you\u2019re the problem.\n\nThis is not just from a political perspective, but examine so many aspects of our culture that have been bullied into submission or given rise to enraged individuals in response.\n\nWhat can we do, if anything? There\u2019s a device and an app for that, whatever \u201cthat\u201d is.\n\nPart of me wants to say put it down but that\u2019s not realistic either. Maybe it\u2019s just frustration with the lack of balance that has been destroyed individually and collectively for too many people in today\u2019s world. Let\u2019s solve the issues in the real world and it will go a long way in the new technology world. We have so many tools at our disposal and if used correctly and combined effectively can help more than hurt.\n\nWebb is host of \u201cThe David Webb Show\u201d on SiriusXM Patriot 125, host of \u201cReality Check with David Webb\u201d on Fox Nation, a Fox News contributor and a frequent television commentator.
