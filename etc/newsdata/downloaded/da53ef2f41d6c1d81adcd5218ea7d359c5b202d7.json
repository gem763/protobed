He had played once, in the EFL Cup. His older brother Sean has become a fixture but Matty has had to wait.\n\nThat they were chosen together here was due largely to circumstance. Bruce\u2019s midfield has been hit by injury, suspension and dreadful form. So this initially looked more desperate than romantic but who cares about that after Longstaff capped an afternoon of hard graft to score the picture book goal that neither he nor his manager will ever forget.\n\nNewcastle, so wretched in losing 5-0 at Leicester last week, had been forthright on the break all afternoon and when Allan Saint-Maximin led another gallop from deep with 18 minutes left, spaces opened up in front of the Gallowgate.\n\nSaint-Maximin had options on both sides but went left to wing-back Jetro Willems. He, too, had choices but one stood out above the others. Longstaff was coming like a train from deep and when Willems laid the ball into his path, he struck it purely and powerfully low to David de Gea\u2019s right from 20 yards. The best goalkeeper in the league never had a prayer.\n\nPredictably, the roof almost came off this old place. For a second, if only for a second, it even stopped raining. Newcastle had been threatening something like this but Longstaff would have been some way down most people\u2019s list of probable scorers. No wonder he celebrated for so long.\n\nThere was a good chunk of time left for United to respond. But this is a new United not the old one. This one is so limited as to be boring. So here Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s team laboured through the later stages and waited for something to drop for them.\n\nIt never did and was never deserved. Bruce was the boss who approached this game as if he had something to prove and it was reflected in his selection \u2014 five changes \u2014 and his team\u2019s showing. Last week they surrendered but here they fronted up. Bruce deserves great credit for that.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s United, on the other hand, just turned up and hoped. There was nothing new about them, nothing to suggest improvement on recent miserable efforts. They had one good chance all afternoon and that was headed wide by Harry Maguire just before half-time \u2014 a horror miss.\n\nDefender DeAndre Yedlin of Newcastle United and winger Daniel James of Manchester United collide in the first half\n\nAllan Saint-Maximin of Newcastle United motivates the crowd during the Premier League match at St James' Park\n\nAndreas Pereira of Manchester United fends off Ciaran Clark of Newcastle United during the first half on Sunday\n\nNewcastle United's Brazilian striker Joelinton (R) vies with Manchester United's England defender Maguire\n\nDiogo Dalot (20) of Manchester United and Jetro Willems of Newcastle United challenge for the ball in the first half\n\nUnited simply must do better. They must be more motivated and must be better coached. They are 12th in the table now, one point ahead of Newcastle.\n\nNewcastle are, remember, one of the favourites to go down and if United lose at home to rampaging Liverpool the other side of the international break then they will start to appear on the bookmakers\u2019 relegation sheets too. After all, it is now 17 points from the last 17 league games under Solskjaer.\n\nWhat a terrible mess United are in and the final few moments of this game summed them up.\n\nGiven a free-kick in a dangerous position on the left deep in added time, Solskjaer signalled for De Gea to join the attack. But the keeper was still ambling into the penalty area when the ball arrived, totally unable to make an impact. Young\u2019s kick was too deep anyway and probably would have gone out of play had Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka not caught it.\n\nSo this is Solskjaer\u2019s United. Disorganised, lacking in cohesion and seemingly incapable of clear thinking. They are a rabble and they are getting worse.\n\nMiguel Almiron of Newcastle United runs with the ball with pressure from midfielder Fred of Manchester United\n\nNewcastle United forward Allan Saint-Maximin in action with Manchester United midfielder Fred at St James' Park\n\nEnglish referee Mike Dean (R) showed a yellow card to Manchester United's Brazilian midfielder Fred (2nd L)\n\nNewcastle United's Sean Longstaff (centre) in action with Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay (left)\n\nHere they were missing key players. That is nobody\u2019s fault. But a club like United should be able to cope. Sadly, they are not getting a single bit of help from a manager who just looks lost.\n\nHere, Newcastle could have scored in the first minute, Saint-Maximin playing in Miguel Almiron who was foiled by Ashley Young. The home team remained flawed and ragged at times but they played with gusto at least and before half-time, Matty Longstaff had hit the bar from distance, Fabian Schar had headed a corner over and Almiron dallied when clean through and was tackled by Maguire.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s team had plenty of the play in the second half but were too slow and predictable. As such they barely fashioned a chance.\n\nTo be generous to them a draw may have been fair but young Longstaff saw only opportunity and grabbed it. At full time he looked as though he wanted to stay out there for ever. When he was eventually persuaded to leave the field where his dreams had just been made, he wore a smile as wide as the Tyne.\n\nAshley Young of Manchester United slides in with a challenge on Miguel Almiron of Newcastle United on Sunday afternoon\n\nAllan Saint-Maximin of Newcastle United runs with the ball with pressure from Fred of Manchester United on Sunday", "description": "IAN LADYMAN AT ST JAMES' PARK: Matty Longstaff scored a stunning strike on his Premier League debut for Newcastle to condemn Manchester United to yet another away defeat.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/18/19366778-0-image-a-55_1570383359968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
