Gonna be ok.\u2019\n\nThank goodness for that.\n\nAs well as dealing with the symptoms of her gruelling gigs, Gaga lives with the chronic pain condition fibromyalgia, and was prevented touring Europe two years ago due to the condition, which causes aching muscles and fatigue.\n\nThe newly single star previously told Vogue: \u2018Chronic pain is no joke. And it\u2019s every day waking up not knowing how you\u2019re going to feel.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
