In the span of just one week in early October, two farms lost thousands of dollars in produce and law enforcement are surprised by just how much has been stolen.\n\nIn early October, thieves plucked and stole 180 bushels of apples \u2014 some \u201cright off the trees\u201d from Spicer Orchards, a Genesee County farm, The Detroit News reported. Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell told the newspaper, \u201cWhoever did it was well organized and apparently had a market for (the apples).\u201d He estimated that Spicer Orchards lost about $14,400 in produce.\n\nMatt Spicer, harvest manager of the farm, told ABC 12 Flint, Michigan he estimated that about 7,000 pounds of fruit \u2014 about 22,000 apples \u2014 were stolen. He said he was \u201cupset\u201d because \u201cit takes a whole year to grow apples.\u201d The ABC 12 reported that the thieves didn\u2019t just steal ripe apples but also those not ready for harvest and others on the ground.\n\nIn neighboring St. Clair County, farmer and owner of McCallum\u2019s Orchard and Cider Mill, Ray Peltier, tells TIME at least 400 of his pumpkins were stolen around Oct. 7. That number could surpass 1,000 by the time they finish assessing the damage, he adds. Peltier estimates they may have lost around $7,500 in produce.\n\n\u201cThis was not a one man job,\u201d Peltier says. \u201cIt was a crew.\u201d\n\nHe had told ABC 7 News Detroit that \u201cit\u2019s mind-boggling\u201d to think how so many pumpkins could be \u201ctaken that fast.\u201d\n\nPeltier says he believes the theft occurred Monday, Oct. 7 between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. but that he didn\u2019t realize the pumpkins had been stolen until later that evening. He said he had to cancel a children\u2019s event involving face and pumpkin painting.\n\nPeltier says that staff from Spicer Orchards called him after the theft to express their solidarity and tell him to be careful about protecting his crop of apples, too.\n\nThe economic toll appears to be dire for Peltier, who says, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose any income. We just can\u2019t. And we did.\u201d", "description": "\"This was not a one man job\"", "authors": ["Sanya Mansoor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k_VJesymFzcOue1rXJ53vQ--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/5f4911677c1af5bc2bd28c77260544ec", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
