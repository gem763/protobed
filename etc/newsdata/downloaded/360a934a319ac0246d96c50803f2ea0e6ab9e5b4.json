(Amir Cohen/Pool via AP)\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking to hold on to power in Tuesday's historic repeat election as the shadow of various corruption charges loom over his future.\n\nIsrael's attorney general has recommended pressing criminal charges against him in three separate corruption cases, pending a long delayed pre-trial hearing scheduled for early October \u2014 just three weeks after the election.\n\nNetanyahu's legal woes \u2014 and the recommendation to indict him on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges \u2014 were well known before the April vote and didn't appear to influence his popularity.\n\nBut Netanyahu appears more vulnerable now. Prior to the April vote, he vowed not to seek formal protection from prosecution. But assuming he had won, Netanyahu's allies then quickly began drafting a contentious bill aimed at granting him immunity and were looking to push legislation limiting the power of Israel's Supreme Court. He's now expected to demand any future coalition partners pledge to back immunity for him, which may limit his options.\n\nThe main opposition party, Blue and White, for instance, already is exploiting Netanyahu's obsession with personal survival. It has ruled out a coalition with him, though it says it would be willing to form a partnership with his Likud party under different leadership. Opinion polls indicate the two parties may have to form a unity government.\n\nWithout immunity, Netanyahu would likely be forced to stand trial, which would put heavy pressure on him to step aside.\n\nHere's a look at the background and current cases facing the longtime Israeli leader:\n\n___\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe scandals have engulfed Netanyahu's family and his inner circle, with at least three former close confidants turning state's witnesses and testifying against him.\n\nAttorney General Avichai Mandelblit says he has enough evidence to press charges against Netanyahu in three separate cases, pending the pre-indictment hearing where Netanyahu will be given the opportunity to defend himself. His political opponents say that even if he's legally permitted to stay in office, he will have lost the moral mandate to lead. They say remaining in office while on trial would be embarrassing and divert his attention from important state issues.\n\nNetanyahu and his wife, Sara, have long been known for their penchant for an expensive lifestyle and questionable use of public funds. Mrs. Netanyahu has been convicted of misusing state funds, after she reached a plea bargain settling allegations that she overspent some $100,000 of state money on lavish meals. She'd previously been indicted for graft, fraud and breach of trust.\n\n___\n\nTELECOM TRADE-OFF\n\nThe most damaging case against Netanyahu involves an influence-peddling scandal in which two of his formerly closest aides are testifying against him on suspicion of promoting regulation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel's Bezeq telecom company. In return, Bezeq's popular news site, Walla, allegedly provided favorable coverage of Netanyahu and his family.\n\nNir Hefetz, a former Netanyahu family spokesman, and Shlomo Filber, the former director of the Communications Ministry under Netanyahu, cut deals with prosecutors after they were arrested along with Bezeq's controlling shareholder Shaul Elovitch, his wife, son and other top Bezeq executives. Former journalists at the Walla news site have attested to being pressured to refrain from negative reporting of Netanyahu.\n\n___\n\nLAVISH GIFTS\n\nPolice recommended indicting Netanyahu over accepting nearly $300,000 in gifts from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer.\n\nPolice say that in return for jewelry, expensive cigars and champagne, Netanyahu operated on Milchan's behalf on U.S. visa matters, tried to legislate a generous tax break for him and sought to promote his interests in the Israeli media market.\n\nPolice have not commented on what Packer, who reportedly sought Israeli residency status for tax purposes, may have received, and Netanyahu has said all he received were gifts from friends. Longtime aide Ari Harow is a state witness in this case.\n\n___\n\nMEDIA MEDDLING\n\nPolice have also recommended indicting Netanyahu for supposedly offering a newspaper publisher legislation that would weaken his paper's main rival in return for more favorable coverage.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking to hold on to power in Tuesday's historic repeat election as the shadow of various corruption charges loom over his future.
