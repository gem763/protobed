Ronan Farrow walked out of NBC News after working on the Weinstein story, and within two months published an incredible article at the New Yorker that not only won a Pulitzer, but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day.\"\n\nHayes went on to praise Farrow's work, saying it's the \"kind of journalism that you want to do as a journalist\" and that everyone in the industry \"should want to facilitate.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Of course, there\u2019s a reason it took so long for the true story about Weinstein to be told, for the many allegations of him to stay locked in a vault,\" Hayes said. \"And that\u2019s because time and again the path of least resistance for those in power was not to cross Weinstein or his army of friends and lawyers. Same goes for the many, many, many other powerful predators that we\u2019ve come to know about.\"\n\n\"The path of least resistance is always there. Beckoning seductively, with an entirely plausible cover story, you\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry, this isn\u2019t the hill to die on, the story isn\u2019t ready. But, of course, it\u2019s the very ease of that path that makes it the enemy to the kind of work we, as journalists, are supposed to do.\u201d", "description": "MSNBC host Chris Hayes\u00a0took a moment on Monday night to address\u00a0the growing controversy surrounding NBC News exposed in Ronan Farrow's new book and praised his reporting,", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
