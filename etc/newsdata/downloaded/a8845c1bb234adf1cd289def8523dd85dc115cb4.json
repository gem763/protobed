While he\u2019s been forced to keep his anger in check due to his wife\u2019s pregnancy, he finds another way to unfairly punish her tonight, when he\u2019s left displeased with her actions.\n\nTonight, Denise (Diane Parish) asks Chantelle to cover a shift at the salon \u2014 and she\u2019s overjoyed at the prospect of returning to work. However, while she relishes the opportunity, she withholds this information from Gray.\n\nMeanwhile, a girl steals from Whitney\u2019s (Shona McGarty) stall, and \u2014 having seen the commotion unfold \u2014 Gray attempts to help. He sets off to apprehend the thief, and \u2014 as a result \u2014 he ends up running by the salon, where he sees Chantelle hard at work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, Chantelle pops into The Queen Vic, but she\u2019s alarmed to see everyone there. However, the reason soon becomes apparent, as Gray wastes little time in announces their news to them all.\n\nGray knows that Chantelle wanted her pregnancy to be kept between them for now, so his decision to tell everyone is undoubtedly linked to the fact that she didn\u2019t tell him about returning to work.\n\nHow will Chantelle react when her news becomes public?\n\nEastEnders continues on Monday 21st October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Gray is left displeased with Chantelle's actions and thus he decides to unfairly punish his wife once more.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18854747-high-e74f_1571650248.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
