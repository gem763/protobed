Despite his \u201cApprentice\u201d image, Trump palpably dislikes firing people. He\u2019d rather let them linger and make their lives miserable (e.g., Jeff Sessions) than pull the plug, possibly because he understands that he has more leverage over them as long as they continue to work for him. Westerhout sat right outside the Oval Office too so she would know better than most in the West Wing what he was doing and who he was talking to at any given moment of his presidency. In other words, she would have lots of tell-all fodder potentially.\n\nBetter to keep her on staff, contrite, and quiet than to risk making a loquacious enemy of her by firing her \u2014 unless she said something so terrible that there was no other option.\n\nPer Politico, it\u2019s pretty bad. It\u2019s not a \u201cleak\u201d but it\u2019s nasty.\n\nMadeleine Westerhout, who left her White House job suddenly on Thursday as President Trump\u2019s personal assistant, was fired after bragging to reporters that she had a better relationship with Trump than his own daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, and that the president did not like being in pictures with Tiffany because he perceived her as overweight\u2026 Westerhout also jokingly told the journalists that Trump couldn\u2019t pick Tiffany out of a crowd, said one of the people. \u201cShe had a couple drinks and in an uncharacteristically unguarded moment, she opened up to the reporters,\u201d the person said\u2026 \u201cThis was an off-the-record dinner and the media blatantly violated that agreement,\u201d an administration official said.\n\nWho burned Westerhout? Ed noted earlier that there\u2019s always been speculation about her as a leaker, partly because she came over from the RNC rather than the Trump campaign and partly because she was superbly positioned to watch his activities during the day. But if Westerhout was an important leaker, it\u2019s bizarre that reporters would have shared her comments about the Trump daughters and risked her getting fired. They\u2019d be killing the golden goose, a prime source of material for their own dishy scoops about Trump.\n\nPolitico notes that Trump press aide Hogan Gidley was also at the dinner but left for an hour or so to do an interview with Fox News, at which point Westerhout supposedly began blabbing about the Trump girls. Maybe Gidley returned to the dinner and ended up chatting with one of the reporters to the effect of \u201cWhat\u2019d you guys talk about while I was gone?\u201d At which point the reporter might have shared Westerhout\u2019s gossip with Gidley and then Gidley might have shared it with the White House. Per Ed\u2019s post this morning, some in the building had knives out for her already due to her attempts to expand her portfolio. Maybe Gidley was part of that.\n\nWhat\u2019s Westerhout\u2019s move now? She\u2019s only 29 and came to Trump from establishment Washington, so it\u2019s conceivable that she\u2019ll keep her mouth shut about what she saw in the White House and try to catch on in some other, more traditional Republican office. But maybe her disloyalty to Trump has now made her radioactive to anti-Trumpers too. Who wants an executive assistant prone to chattering to reporters about your issues with your own children? If she\u2019s frozen out of politics because of her mistake, the only thing left to do might be to write that tell-all and cash in. Maybe the White House realizes that and is working quietly behind the scenes to get her a position with a Republican office in Congress somewhere. Keep her on the team and she\u2019ll keep quiet, hopefully.", "description": "\u201cShe had a couple drinks...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/w-3.jpg"}
