REUTERS/Ammar Awad/File Photo\n\nTUNIS (Reuters) - British tourists in Tunisia said their hotel stopped them leaving for several hours on Saturday night over concerns about payment by their holiday operator Thomas Cook, though the Tunisian government said the incident was a misunderstanding.\n\nGary Seale, a guest at the Orangers Hotel in Hammamet, posted on Facebook at 9.39pm: \u201csecurity have refused to let us out of the hotel and barricaded us in\u201d. He later posted that he reached the airport later on Saturday and flew home on Sunday.\n\nThe incident came amid growing concerns raised by some customers of Thomas Cook, as the company\u2019s bosses met lenders and creditors in London in a last-ditch attempt to raise 200 million pounds to keep it afloat.\n\nThe British government has said it has plans in place to bring home stranded holidaymakers if Thomas Cook (TCG.L) - the world\u2019s oldest travel company - goes out of business.\n\nThomas Cook itself was not immediately available to comment, but it has been using its social media channels to reassure customers that the company is still operating as normal.\n\nTunisia\u2019s Tourism Ministry on Sunday attributed the incident to a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and said the tourists had been able to leave on the flight on which were originally booked.\n\n\u201cFourteen tourists were asked to wait a few minutes to confirm with the representative of Thomas Cook... and quickly got the agreement, and the tourists left and travelled on time last night,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\nTourism, a critical sector for Tunisia\u2019s economy, was hit hard in 2015 by two militant attacks that killed scores of people, with tourist numbers only recovering this year according to the government.", "description": "British tourists in Tunisia said their hotel stopped them leaving for several hours on Saturday night over concerns about payment by their holiday operator Thomas Cook, though the Tunisian government said the incident was a misunderstanding.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432646021&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0I0", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
