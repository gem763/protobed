The IRS has certain rules that 401(k) beneficiaries must follow that determine when and how much tax they\u2019ll pay to inherit someone else\u2019s retirement plan. If you\u2019re currently the beneficiary of a 401(k) or you\u2019ve recently inherited one, here are the most important things you need to know.\n\nWhat Is an Inherited 401(k)?\n\nAn inherited 401(k) is simply a 401(k) that\u2019s been passed on to a beneficiary on the death of the account owner. If the original 401(k) owner is married, the inheritor is usually their spouse. The exception to the rule is if their spouse signs a waiver allowing them to name someone else as their plan beneficiary.\n\nIf a spouse waives their right to inherit a 401(k) or the account owner is unmarried, they can leave their account to whomever they want upon their death. That includes children, siblings or other relatives, as well as a trust or charity.\n\nHow an inherited 401(k) is taxed is based on three key factors:\n\nYour relationship to the account owner\n\nYour age when you inherit the 401(k)\n\nThe account owner\u2019s age when they pass away\n\nThere\u2019s also more than one way to take a distribution from a 401(k) when you\u2019ve inherited one. The options include a lump sum, periodic payments or distributions stretched out your life expectancy.\n\nInheriting a 401(k) as a Spousal Beneficiary\n\nHere are the guidelines for an inherited 401k. More\n\nIf you inherit a 401(k) from your spouse, what you decide to do with it and the subsequent tax impacts may depend largely on your age. If you\u2019re under age 59 1/2, you can do one of three things:\n\n1. Leave the money in the plan and take distributions.\n\nIf you decide to leave inherited 401(k) funds in the plan, you can take withdrawals from the account without triggering the 10% early withdrawal penalty. You\u2019d still pay regular income tax on any distributions you take. If your spouse was age 70 1/2 or older when they passed away, you would have to take required minimum distributions from the account. Again, there would be no early withdrawal penalty but you would pay income tax on the withdrawals. If they were younger than 70 1/2 when they passed away, you could wait to take RMDs until you turn 70 1/2.\n\n2. Transfer the funds to an inherited IRA.\n\nAn inherited IRA is an individual retirement account that\u2019s designed to hold rollover funds from an inherited retirement plan, including 401(k)s. You can make withdrawals without triggering an early withdrawal penalty. This kind of account would require you to take minimum distributions but the amount would be based on your own life expectancy, not the amount your spouse would have been required to take.\n\n3. Transfer the money to your own IRA.\n\nIf you already have an IRA in place you could roll an inherited 401(k) into it with no tax penalty. The catch is that if you\u2019re under age 59 1/2 when you execute the rollover, the withdrawal will be treated like a regular distribution. That means you\u2019ll pay income tax on the full amount, along with the 10% early withdrawal penalty.\n\nIf you\u2019re over age 59 1/2, you won\u2019t have to worry about paying the early withdrawal penalty with any of these options. If your spouse was taking required minimum distributions from their 401(k) when they passed away, you\u2019d have the option to continue taking them or delay taking them until you turn 70 1/2.\n\nIf you\u2019re already 70 1/2 or older, you\u2019d be required to take minimum distributions \u2013 regardless of whether you leave the money in the 401(k), transfer it to an inherited IRA or roll it over to your existing IRA.\n\nInheriting a 401(k) as a Non-Spouse\n\nWhat you do with an inherited 401(k) as a non-spouse is tied to how old the account owner was when you inherited the plan and the plan\u2019s distribution rules. If the account owner hadn\u2019t yet turned 70 1/2, it\u2019s possible that the plan may allow you to spread distributions out over your lifetime or spread them out over a five-year period. If you take the five-year option, you may have to fully withdraw all of the account assets by the end of the fifth year following the account owner\u2019s passing. In either case, you\u2019d owe income tax on the withdrawals.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Inheriting a 401(k) on the death of the account owner isn't always as straightforward as inheriting other types of assets.
