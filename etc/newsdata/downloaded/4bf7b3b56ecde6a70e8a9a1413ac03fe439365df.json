I would like to see the government develop a comprehensive plan to stay below 1.5 degrees [Celsius] of warming.\"\n\nHer plan refers to a 2018 United Nations report that said the earth has warmed 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 19th Century. The report looks at the consequences of it were to warm 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nLim also wants to see a plan put in place to help people who will be affected by climate change, including displaced people, and people losing work in industries like agriculture, fishing, oil, and gas.\n\nEmma Lim, center, with her mother, left, and Sophie Price, right, who also took the pledge More\n\nCourtesy of Emma Lim\n\nThe teen said that climate change is a \"fact of life\" for her generation.\n\n\"When you're young you believe that your government will fix things, and so I joined the green team and we worked on recycling and I figured that everything would be okay,\" she told Insider. \"But that trust in your leaders erodes over time.\"\n\nLim said she first became disenchanted after watching the Ontario Legislative Assembly's climate debate in May, and she determined government officials weren't doing enough to combat the effects of climate change.\n\nAs she spoke to friends about the issue, Lim she realized she wasn't the only one who's scared. She said her friends, too, are losing hope.\n\n\"I launched the pledge because I wanted other people to understand how the fear of climate is so unquestioned in my generation. It's something everybody feels. Where in my parent's or grandparent's generation, believing in climate change is often a matter of opinion and not survival,\" she told Insider.\n\nTeens across the world are calling for cation against climate change\n\nA recent climate strike in Montreal, where demonstrators used fake blood for a Die-In strike.
