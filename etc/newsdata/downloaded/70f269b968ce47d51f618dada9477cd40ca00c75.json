Currently, the death toll stands at 74, with thousands of residents still without power or water.*\n\nDays before its landfall, the Japanese authorities had urged the country to prepare for the worst.\n\nFrom early Saturday morning, the Japanese Meteorology Agency (JMA) was in a frenzy issuing flooding and landslide alerts one after another, as deadly torrential rains poured over Japan\u2019s central prefectures.\n\nCalls for evacuation and for people to take appropriate measures to protect their lives were blasted across all of the areas in immediate danger of a disaster. And for the first time since its creation, a Level 5 \u201cHeavy Rain Alert\u201d\u2014the highest in the JMA\u2019s 5-stage scale\u2014was issued for Tokyo.\n\nApple didn\u2019t get the memo\n\nUnless in an evacuation area, people were encouraged to stay indoors to avoid any life-threatening danger coming from the storm winds and rain.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like a certain tech giant\u2019s AI didn\u2019t get the memo as Apple Watch users reported receiving notifications suggesting they go for a run right in the middle of the typhoon.\n\nAppleWatch\u304b\u3089\u3068\u3093\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044 \u901a\u77e5 \uff08 \u3064\u3046\u3061 \uff09 \u304c \u6765 \uff08 \u304d \uff09 \u305f = I received an unthinkable notification from my Apple Watch.\n\nOn the watch screen we can see a short motivational reminder that being more active is down to you and you alone.\n\n\u300c \u4eca\u65e5 \uff08 \u304d\u3087\u3046 \uff09 \u306f \u8d70 \uff08 \u306f\u3057 \uff09 \u308c\u306a\u3044\u300d\u3068 \u6c7a \uff08 \u304d \uff09 \u3081\u3064\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u306f \u81ea\u5206 \uff08 \u3058\u3076\u3093 \uff09 \u3060\u3051\u3002\u305d\u3093\u306a \u610f\u898b \uff08 \u3044\u3051\u3093 \uff09 \u3092 \u805e \uff08 \u304d \uff09 \u304f \u5fc5\u8981 \uff08 \u3072\u3064\u3088\u3046 \uff09 \u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u4eca\u65e5\u3082\u8d70\u308d\u3046\u201d\n\n= \u201cThe only person deciding \u2018I can\u2019t run today\u2019 is you.
