We wanted to be respectful but we didn\u2019t just want to stand in a flat line.\"\n\nEngland's move is thought to have been masterminded by boss Eddie Jones, who saw his side dominate the world champions in a colossal performance.\n\n(Image: Pixel8000)\n\nAn early try from Manu Tuilagi set England on their way to a 19-7 victory, with George Ford showing pinpoint accuracy with his boot.\n\nThey now head into Saturday's final against South Africa - who beat Wales in the other semi-final thanks to a late penalty kick from Handre Pollard.\n\nOne disappointment in the England camp was an injury to replacement scrum-half Willi Heinz, who will not feature in the tournaments showpiece.\n\nSaracens' Ben Spencer is now flying out to Japan to join up with the squad for the final as cover for starter Ben Youngs.\n\nThe 27-year-old only has three international caps to his name so far in his career.\n\nMirror columnist Paul Grayson told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It takes six, seven, eight days to get over the jet lag, even if I am sure Ben Spencer is travelling in the right part of the plane.\n\n\"Could he have been better prepared by being involved with the squad more often? It's certainly not ideal preparation.\"\n\nRugby World Cup winner Matt Dawson added: \"\"As much as Ben has been in and around the squad, to be parachuted in for the World Cup final - it would be a heck of a story if he got on.\n\n\"He's absolutely the right guy. He's got that ability to control, he's been playing in a Saracens side and his game management is good. He was absolutely the number one man.\"", "description": "Eddie Jones was behind the mind-game tactics from his troops ahead of their victorious semi-final win over the All Blacks", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "World Rugvia Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740603.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-v-New-Zealand-Rugby-World-Cup-2019-Semi-Final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
