Grateful\n\nPlant-based meat alternatives like the Impossible burger have seen such an uptick in hype and headlines lately that you could say it\u2019s impossible (yep, went there) to miss the trend towards more sustainable \u201cmeats.\u201d But you\u2019re probably also wondering, do these meatless burgers taste like the real thing?\n\nIf you\u2019re skeptical, you\u2019re surely not alone. In fact, the more ubiquitous meatless burgers become, the more pushback against these meat-free products there seems to be. Many critics take aim at the fact these products \u2014 in order to look, feel, smell, and taste like traditional meat \u2014 are highly processed. While the companies creating them insist the processing is done in a responsible and healthier way, detractors continue to take aim at what they see as hyper-processing. (Note: Healthy and highly processed aren\u2019t always mutually exclusive.)\n\nBut, here\u2019s the deal: Companies like Impossible and Beyond Meat have the capacity to change our food system for the better by creating products that are more sustainable. They have the potential to feed the growing middle class in a way that is affordable, ethically sourced, and less damaging to the environment than traditional meat.\n\nMore: Chocolate bars that are actually good for your gut\n\nImpossible Burger versus Beyond Burger.

In fact, we were willing to drive 500 miles round-trip to get our hands on a pack of Impossible \u201cground beef\u201d alternative. We also picked up traditional beef and Beyond Burger to round out our slider taste test.\n\nWe won\u2019t spoil the results for you \u2014 you\u2019ll have to pick them up (or watch us chow down in the video below) to form your opinion. What we will say is you shouldn\u2019t write these plant-based burger alternatives off before you try them.\n\nThey might just surprise you, as they did us.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/grateful/2019/10/22/impossible-burger-better-than-beyond-meat-burger/4066118002/", "description": "You shouldn\u2019t write plant-based burger alternatives like Impossible burger and Beyond Meat off before you try them \u2013\u00a0or at least watch us try them.", "authors": ["Julie Sprankles", "Published P.M.
