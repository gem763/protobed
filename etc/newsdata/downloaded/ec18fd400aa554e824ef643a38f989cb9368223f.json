'I do not know what to do,' he was quoted as saying.\n\n'All that is left to me is to rely on God. I will lie on my bed and pray to God.'\n\nTereshin (pictured showing off his 'ridiculous' arms) enlarged his biceps by 10 inches in just 10 days after injecting 'litres' of synthol into his arms\n\nKirill Tereshin with his former fiancee, model Olesya Malibu.
