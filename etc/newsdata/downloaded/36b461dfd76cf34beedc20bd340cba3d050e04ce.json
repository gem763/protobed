And yet there are signs in this latest iteration that EA Sports have been spooked by the emergence of their unlikeliest noisy neighbour yet: Fortnite.\n\nNot content with hoovering up every last penny of its players\u2019 pocket money, FIFA now wants to commandeer every second of their free time too. Its two dominant modes - returning loot box-infested card trading behemoth FIFA Ultimate Team (or FUT for short), and slick new street-smart addition Volta - have been precision tooled to do to the attention economy what Manchester City\u2019s forward line does to Premier League defences, or its accountants do to Financial Fair Play.\n\nMore of which in due course. First though, amid the omnipresent temptation of micro-transactions and labyrinthine reward loops, there\u2019s a game of football to be played and the initial exchanges are encouraging. That caveat holds more water than with most games of this ilk, though as critiquing FIFA\u2019s gameplay has become... troublesome. How the game plays now, a week before it\u2019s even run out onto the pitch in public for the first time, will likely be very different to how it plays in January. Or even next month.", "description": "The FIFA franchise has successfully faced off against a wide variety of adversaries since its resurgence a decade ago:", "authors": ["Dan Silver", "Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gaming/2019/08/08/FIFA-20-Hazard-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
