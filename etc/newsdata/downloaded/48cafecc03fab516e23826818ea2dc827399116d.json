Which may be just as well as he is about to make a lot more of them.\n\nBorn in 1954, the son of a coastguard, he supplemented the family\u2019s meagre income by selling lemonade on Istanbul\u2019s streets.\n\nAfter attending Islamic School he did a degree in business management before taking his first steps into politics.\n\nIn the 1970s he joined the Islamist National Salvation Party, challenging the secular tradition that had been the hallmark of Turkey since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk\u2019s presidency in the 1920s.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhen Erdogan was banned from taking his seat in parliament in 1991 he successfully stood to be Mayor of Istanbul in 1994.\n\nIn 1999 he was jailed for four months for reading out an Islamist poem that included the lines \u201cthe mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers.\u201d\n\nTwo years later he founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) which swept to power in 2002 with Erdogan as Prime Minister.\n\nHis initial years in power saw him reach out to a West that was, in those days, still hoping that Turkey could one day join the EU.\n\nCritics of his tendency to accumulate power and silence critics were won over by his economic reforms and technocratic flair.\n\nBut it became increasingly hard to ignore his authoritarian tendencies.\n\nIn 2014 he became the country\u2019s first directly-elected president.\n\nThen in 2016 he used the aborted military coup to impose a state of emergency that saw him throttle dissent and imprison opponents.\n\nHe then held a referendum in 2017 to grant himself more powers.\n\nErdogan abolished the post of Prime Minister and gave himself the right to appoint ministers and senior civil servants, issue decrees and oversee all security matters.\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office said the scale of the repression was \u201cstaggering\u201d.\n\nIn the past three years nearly 160,000 people have been arrested; 152,000 civil servants sacked; teachers, judges and lawyers prosecuted on trumped-up charges; 300 journalists arrested; 100,000 websites blocked and 180 media outlets shut down.\n\nLike Trump he is not adverse to large scale building projects, though his recently completed presidential palace in Ankara makes Trump Towers look like an exhibit from LegoLand.\n\nThe building cost \u00a3476million and has more than 1,000 rooms, including a laboratory where scientists can check the president\u2019s food has not been poisoned.\n\nIn the first sign that Erdogan\u2019s grip on power may be fading, his party lost the Istanbul elections in March.\n\nAfter ordering a re-run on the unproven charges of vote rigging he was defeated again with the Republican People\u2019s Party winning by an even bigger margin.\n\nThe economy has also begun to slow with unemployment reaching 15% and inflation nudging 20%.\n\nHis invasion of northern Syria is seen by some as a classic example of a leader using a military exercise to distract attention from domestic failings.\n\nHaving won power as a nationalist hard man, Erdogan would have looked weak if he failed to move against Kurds he has long accused of being terrorists.\n\nThe brutality witnessed on the domestic front has now extended to the foreign.\n\nAirstrikes on Kurdish territory by Turkey forces have killed innocent children and caused thousands of civilians to flee the area.\n\nAny chance of Turkey joining the EU has evaporated because of Erdogan\u2019s autocratic rule.\n\nThis has pushed the Turkish leader closer towards Vladimir Putin.\n\n(Image: MAXIM SHIPENKOV/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe growing ties with Russia were underlined by the recent purchase of Russian S-400 missiles, a move which raised fresh questions about Turkey\u2019s NATO membership.\n\nBut Erdogan is playing a dangerous game with his incursion into Northern Syria.\n\nSeveral Arab states have condemned the move amid fears it could upset the delicate balance of power in the region and lead to a revival of ISIS.\n\nThe nightmare outcome is a war between Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces now allied with Assad and supported with Russian firepower.\n\nIn such a scenario would NATO fulfil its duty to support an ally in all circumstances?\n\nTom Tugenhat MP, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs committee, says Putin could emerge as the main winner with Assad tightening his grip on Syria and the solidarity of NATO undermined.\n\n\u201cAmerica pulling out was a display of weakness. The danger now is Russia wins either way,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether Turkey wins is another matter.\n\nErdogan risks turning a country that wanted to be the friends of the East and the West into a pariah state.", "description": "The political career of Recep Tayyip Erdogan goes a long way to explain his country's latest invasion of Syria", "authors": ["Jason Beattie", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images", "Anadolu Agency Via Getty Images", "Maxim Shipenkov Pool Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587014.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_G20-Leaders-Summit-in-Hamburg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
