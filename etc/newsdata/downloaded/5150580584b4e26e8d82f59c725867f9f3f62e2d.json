The Government needs to stop turning a blind eye to 200,000 children in kinship care and accept its guidance is not enough.'\n\nKinship carers often take on the responsibility for a child in the family because their parents have drug, alcohol or mental health problems.\n\nSometimes they have suffered abuse and neglect and been taken into the care system by the police or local authority.\n\nThe poll revealed 79 per cent of kinship carers are asked to take on a child by their social worker, 18 per cent by the parents themselves and six per cent by the police.\n\nIn 83 per cent of cases children's services have been involved with the child's birth parents or original carers.\n\nHalf of kinship carers said they felt under pressure to make a decision, while 95 per cent said they hadn't had any form of training and 90 per cent received no help from the local authority.\n\nJudith Blake, of the Local Government Association, added: 'Demand for child protection services has increased significantly while councils' budgets to support children and families continue to be under increasing pressure, with money being diverted to protect those children at most immediate risk of harm.\n\n'Extra funding for next year will help, but Government needs to ensure that councils receive the long-term, consistent funding they need.'", "description": "More than 200,000 children in Britain are taken in by their grandparents, aunts, uncles or other relatives after being 'dumped' by their parents.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19391016-0-image-a-3_1570444709771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
