We\u2019re talking about the kind of A-list stylists who have appointments booked a year out and charge a small fortune \u2014 which makes Eva Mendes\u2019 latest Instagram post all the more unusual.\n\n\n\nThe actress took to social media yesterday to share a photo while getting a haircut, but she wasn\u2019t in a Beverly Hills hotspot. Mendes was actually at Supercuts, the chain salon with affordable prices and thousands of locations around the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOk this is a terrible angle but thought you guys would like to know that yea, I stop into @supercuts every once in awhile. Y que,\u201d she wrote in the caption, mixing in some Spanglish. (\u201cY que\u201d translates to \u201cand what.\u201d)\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t business as usual for the celeb set, we know that Mendes does stan for bargains. Read: She collaborates with mass store New York & Co as well as Circa Cosmetics, which is sold at CVS. She even told us once that she swears by a $4 face mask.\n\n\n\nSo what did she drop on this chop? The rates vary from salon to salon, but according to the Market Lofts location in Los Angeles, cuts go for $28 without wash, and with wash (which, telling from the photo, Mendes got) rings up at $34. Now the only questions left is whether or not Ryan Gosling has ever joined his wife on one of her Supercuts visits.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?", "description": "When it comes to celebrity haircuts, stars have access to some of the most famous pros in the industry.
