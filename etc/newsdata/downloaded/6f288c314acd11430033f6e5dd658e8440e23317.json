The company had earlier expected margins to be around the same level as last year.\n\n\"New CEO Laxman Narasimhan's debut commentary reflects a big helping of sackcloth and ashes tempered by a dose of optimism,\" Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said.\n\n\"The lowered outlook will create some room for manoeuvre, at inevitable cost to the share price.\"\n\nReckitt's shares were down 2.3% at 5,732 pence at 1040 GMT.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in London; Editing by David Holmes and Mark Potter)", "description": "Reckitt Benckiser's  new chief executive promised on Tuesday to step up spending on its brands and improve performance after the British household goods maker cut its full-year sales forecast for a second time.  \"We are not pleased with where we are and we must consistently deliver,\" Laxman", "authors": ["Siddharth Cavale"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/utvkSkuOHX8CKxEMi9gutg--~B/aD01MDg7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/reuters.com/cd35e7c20e9be90bf1b935a6ac033070", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
