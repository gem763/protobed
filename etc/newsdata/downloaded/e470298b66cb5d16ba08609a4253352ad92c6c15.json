It\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe facility will be privately funded, and the athletic department has raised $19 million so far. Maryland is still working to complete the Cole Field House project, which will turn the site into a $210 million indoor football facility. Only $60 million had been raised as of last month. Given that project, Turgeon said he had to wait patiently for the new basketball facility.\n\n\u201cI believe as an athletic department that we\u2019ve got to continue to push and move forward and grow,\u201d Evans said of pursuing both projects simultaneously. \u201cOur basketball programs are important to us, the history and tradition that we have. I believe that we have the fan base and the support out there to do so.\u201d\n\nThe basketball performance center will connect to Xfinity Center, where both programs play. The plans for the 60,000-square-foot facility include two full-size courts, a strength and conditioning facility, locker rooms, lounges and space dedicated to sports medicine. Turgeon said the strength and conditioning facility is at least four times the size of Maryland\u2019s current space. Women\u2019s coach Brenda Frese called the center a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the expected completion date, Evans\u2019s reply was \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d noting that this sort of project typically takes about 36 months and the athletic department remains focused on completing fundraising. Tuesday marked the start of what Evans called a \u201ccomprehensive fundraising campaign.\u201d Opportunities for naming rights are available, and Evans would not comment on whether Under Armour would be financially involved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurgeon has begun incorporating the new facility into his recruiting pitches. Both coaches lean on the school\u2019s basketball tradition, but the performance center will elevate what the programs can offer and showcase the athletic department\u2019s commitment.\n\n\u201cWe already play in the best facility in the country,\u201d Frese said of Xfinity Center. \u201cAnd now to have a practice facility to be able to match it \u2014 very, very exciting day.\u201d\n\nTurgeon pointed to the challenges of juggling practice time slots at Xfinity Center. He mentioned how last winter his team once missed practice and the next day had to train in a different building because the arena was hosting graduation proceedings. So while the new facility will boost recruiting efforts, it will also address other concerns.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis building is not about keeping up with the Joneses,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cIt\u2019s an arms race in college athletics, but this building is needed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOnce the practice facility is complete, Xfinity Center will be able to accommodate more events \u2014 a revenue boost for the athletic department. Maryland\u2019s Olympic sports teams will benefit from the space in Xfinity Center that the basketball teams vacate, but the most significant impact will be felt by the basketball teams, which will happily welcome their new, spacious home.\n\nThe facility \u201cwill usher in a new era for success for basketball,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt will be a symbol of excellence, not only for our fans but our coaches, our student-athletes and this great institution.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The new facility will be a \"game-changer\" that's sorely needed, the school's coaches said.", "authors": ["Emily Giambalvo", "Reporter Covering University Of Maryland Athletics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0P23mLjg98zvy6WF337XL57RuG8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QC5ZZPAVNCL5JVM4FKJODZSJY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
