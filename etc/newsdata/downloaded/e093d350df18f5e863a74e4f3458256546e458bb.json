Contestants are expected to navigate across difficult terrain as quickly as possible using a map and compass, visiting a series of control points along the way.\n\nAccording to the International Orienteering Federation (IOF), the Chinese team took a number of top spots in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s orienteering at the Military World Games, which are being held in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The games drew about 10,000 athletes, coaches, and officials.\n\nAfter the competition, administrators discovered the Chinese athletes were \u201cillegally aided by spectators and had used markings and small paths prepared for them during Sunday\u2019s race,\u201d as the BBC put it. The results of the orienteering competition were annulled after complaints from other teams.\n\nThe IOF rejected an appeal from China and stated the entire competition was \u201cunfortunately overshadowed by extensive cheating by the Chinese team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Defence, whose People\u2019s Liberation Army are joint organisers of the games, did not immediately respond to a request for comment,\u201d AFP reported on Friday.\n\nThe UK Guardian cheekily suggested the Chinese orienteering team must have lost its moral compass and described the incident as a tremendous embarrassment for China, which was hosting the Military World Games for the first time. The opening ceremony on October 18 was presided over by Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cNews of the disqualification was not widely reported in Chinese media on Thursday, in contrast to reports this week celebrating the team\u2019s wins,\u201d the Guardian noted.\n\nAFP noted that Chinese athletes have recently been caught taking shortcuts and using bicycles in marathon races, while the BBC recalled three Chinese runners getting banned for life from the Boston Marathon in April for rules infractions, including the use of forged paperwork to get into the race.", "description": "China\u2019s entire national orienteering team was kicked out of the Military World Games on Friday because it was caught cheating.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1172699823-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
