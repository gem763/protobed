Tweens girls, who are between the ages of 9 and 12, are exceptionally tough to please because their tastes can oscillate between the realms of childhood and proper teenage-hood. To make things easier, we asked 12 tweens about what\u2019s at the top of their must-have lists. Read on for the VSCO essentials, clothing, art supplies, and other gifts that they say are sure to impress the tween in your life.\n\nJewelry and accessory gifts for tween girls\n\nEtsy Custom Name Necklace According to model Parys B., \u201cword necklaces are so stylish, girls love them.\u201d This custom pendant comes in both gold and silver finishes and a range of chain lengths, from 12 to 24 inches. \u201cIt really just makes your outfit pop.\u201d $23 at Etsy Buy\n\nUrban Outfitters Simple Cowrie Shell Pendant Necklace $10 (was $16, now 38% off) Shell jewelry, a VSCO girl essential, is also super popular right now, says 9-year-old singer Nia Gisselle. This simple gold chain with a dangling cowrie shell feels stylish enough to go from the beach to homeroom. $10 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nState Kane Backpack Ariella Maizner, the 10-year-old designer and founder of lifestyle brand Theme, loves State backpacks because \u201cwhen you buy a State bag, they give bags to kids that need them, too.\u201d She also likes that they can be customized with tie-dye or patches. \u201cAnything that is one of a kind and does good is my style.\u201d $85 at Shopbop Buy\n\nActress and model Hendley Williams loves Bath & Body Works hand sanitizer, which would serve as a perfect stocking stuffer. \u201cI love going and getting different smells. They are easy to put in your bag, and I actually have one attached in a cute case on my backpack,\u201d she says. This five-pack has a range of scents, including sweet pea and cucumber melon, and when it comes to cases, it doesn\u2019t get cuter than this little puff.\n\nHydro Flask Water Bottle Four of the tweens we spoke to said that a HydroFlask \u2014 the perennial VSCO girl accessory \u2014 is at the top of their wish lists. According to Maizner, the Hydroflask is the \u201cwater bottle all of my friends want or carry right now. So it\u2019s definitely the perfect gift for a tween.\u201d Plus, they\u2019re durable, keep water ice-cold for long periods, and are good for the environment, she adds. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at REI Buy\n\nFXBUY 100 PCS Mixed Stickers The tweens we talked to also stress that part of the fun of owning a Hyrdroflask is personalizing it with stickers. \u201cTweens like to customize them with cool stickers,\u201d explains model Alex M. Williams adds that stickers can also be stuck on school binders, laptops, and phone cases. \u201cSome of my favorite stickers are plants, places I\u2019ve visited, my favorite stores, and there are stickers for your favorites memes, too,\u201d Williams says, which is why she likes this variety pack that features lots of different designs. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nVANS Ranger Fanny Pack $17 (was $30, now 43% off) As actor and model Brooklyn Ajjan told us, \u201canything \u201990s\u201d like scrunchies, combat boots, and fanny packs, is back in a big way. She particularly loves this fanny pack with the classic Vans checkerboard pattern. $17 at Tillys Buy\n\nLoveShackFancy x Lele Sadoughi Petite Knotted Headband \u201cI am really into scrunchies and headbands, bandanas, and barrettes,\u201d says Maizner, who adds that hair accessories are super popular amongst her friends, too. While she personally loves Theme\u2019s Tie Dye Bandanas, she also tends to buy hair accessories that have floral or paisley prints, like this LoveShackFancy x Lele Sadoughi knotted headband. $65 at LoveShackFancy Buy\n\nDonni Large Mixed Pearl Barrette \u201cThe perfect Barrett is by Donni,\u201d says Maizner. \u201cI love pearls and she has the cutest one.\u201d Our round up of the best hair clips according to cool people has tons of more fun options to consider for the tween in your life, as does our gift guide for teen girls. $74 at Donni Buy\n\nBeauty gifts for tween gifts\n\nGlossier Moisturizing Moon Mask While Maizner says she hasn\u2019t really started wearing makeup yet, \u201cat sleep-away camp and sleepovers, my friends and I always do face masks.\u201d She uses Glossier\u2019s Moisturizing Moon Mask because it\u2019s \u201cgood for sensitive skin and, most importantly, cruelty-free.\u201d Glossier also includes a sheet of stickers free with every purchase which, as we\u2019ve already established, are a crowd-pleaser. $22 at Glossier Buy\n\nVictoria's Secret PINK Fresh And Clean Fragrance Travel Size Body Mist When it comes to fragrance, Parys is a fan of Victoria\u2019s Secret Pink body mist. \u201cThe colors and packaging are so cool; the smells are really good and light, not heavy and strong. When my mom first brought it, I had to bag it for myself,\u201d she says. $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nLush Shoot For The Stars Bath Bomb \u201cLush bath bombs are also on my wish list this year. They are super fun to use and they smell amazing,\u201d says 12-year-old Ella M. In addition to its regular line, Lush also makes limited-edition bath bombs that are an excellent buy for the holidays, like this one, from its Christmas line, that has gold glitter stars. \u201cI love these products because there are so many different varieties in lots of colors and scents to try,\u201d Ella says. $8 at Lush Buy\n\nFenty Beauty by Rihanna Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer Another starter beauty product is lip gloss, which 12-year-old model and actress Jada B. told us she\u2019s hoping to get this year. Strategist beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton says Fenty\u2019s gloss is \u201cvery nourishing\u201d and gave \u201cthe perfect finishing touch for a glowy, sun-kissed look.\u201d $18 at Sephora Buy\n\nTech gifts for tween girls\n\nApple iPhone 11 Jada is also hoping for a new phone this year \u2014 specifically the iPhone 11, because it\u2019s new and improved camera makes it even better for taking photos. From $699 at Apple Buy\n\nApple AirPods $144 (was $159, now 9% off) As an accessory to a new iPhone, two of our tweens mentioned wanting Airpods. \u201cThere is nothing worse than digging through your bag for your headphones to find them in a tangled up wadded mess,\u201d says Ajjan, who adds that while she loves her Beats, sometimes her \u201ccurls can pay the price.\u201d Which is why \u201cAirpods are the perfect answer.\u201d $144 at Amazon Buy $144 at Walmart Buy\n\nCrosley UO Exclusive Cream + Rose Gold Cruiser Bluetooth Record Player Twelve-year-old musician Dallas Knight prefers a more old-school approach to listening to music. \u201cI am very into music and, as a singer and guitarist, love listening to classic rock and pop songs.\u201d While she specifically wants a vintage record player, those may be harder to source in one piece. We think this cream-colored Crosley player with rose-gold accents has that vintage-y look she\u2019s after, while still being compatible with more modern technologies, like Bluetooth. $99 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nWHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? Vinyl \u201cVinyl records to go along with the record player are also gifts that I would love,\u201d says Knight. Several tweens we spoke to specifically mentioned they were hoping for Billie Eilish tickets this year, so a record of her newest album (or any other piece of Eilish merch, like a T-shirt) is a no-brainer. \u201cI love Billie Eilish. She is such an inspiration as a songwriter and champion of breaking the mold of what it means to be a girl,\u201d says Ajjan. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nNintendo Switch Jada also has a Nintendo Switch on her list, which she plays with her friends. The Switch can be played on both a television set, as well as on-the-go, making it a versatile choice for busy tweens. $299 at Amazon Buy $299 at Amazon Buy\n\nClothing gifts for tween girls\n\nUrban Outfitters The Rolling Stones 1994 Tour Tee $39 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nLike with record players, \u201ctweens are starting to get into vintage music and bands,\u201d according to Alex M. While buying clothing can be difficult, a tee sporting the logo of a classic rock and roll band \u2014 like The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, or The Clash \u2014 is a sure bet.\n\nBillabong Girls' Full Bloom Pullover Crew \u201cAs a girl who loves skateboarding and surfing, I love to rock a style that matches my lifestyle,\u201d says competitive athlete Ellie Blue. She loves this Billabong pullover crew because it is both \u201csporty and girly.\u201d $40 at Billabong Buy\n\nDr. Martens 1460 Original 8-Eye Leather Boot $125 (was $140, now 11% off) Both Ajjan and Alex M. want a pair of classic Dr. Martens leather combat boots.

Gisselle is one big fan of the brand, and says both the slip-on skate shoe and the original sneaker are popular styles.\n\nToys and creative gifts for tween girls\n\nAmerican Girl Customizable Gift Trunk If your tween is still into toys, twins Leah and Ava Clements, who have over one-million Instagram followers, suggest American Girl. \u201cWe absolutely love American Girl and were so excited when we saw that they now offer a customizable gift box!\u201d Each trunk comes with a doll, two hand-selected play packs, and an illustrated story, chosen after completing a short quiz. The box also includes other extras, including a heartfelt letter (personalized by the gift-giver), a doll ear-piercing option, and a decorative trunk to store it all. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the best gift ever,\u201d they say. From $265 at American Girl Buy\n\nSwagtron Swagskate NG3 Electric Skateboard \u201cWe\u2019ve recently gotten into skateboarding and enjoy playing outdoors with our friends, so we really love this new mini e-board,\u201d the Clements twins say. The smart-sensors system allows a kick-to-cruise experience with no remote needed, and detects weight and motion, \u201cautomatically stopping the board in seconds when you dismount,\u201d they told us. \u201cThis is definitely on the top of our wishlist this season.\u201d $130 at Amazon Buy $130 at Amazon Buy\n\nBaker DO Logo Finger Paint 8.12\" Skateboard Deck If you\u2019re looking for a more traditional skateboard, Blue loves Baker Skateboards. The deck can also be hung on your tween\u2019s bedroom wall if she\u2019s not ready to ride. \u201cA skateboard is the perfect gift for girls! I got one when I was super little, but it\u2019s never too late to start,\u201d says 11-year-old Sky Brown, who has her own collaboration with Almost Skateboards. $55 at Zumiez Buy\n\nSchwinn Cabo Cruise Bike For a two-wheeled option, Alex M. suggests a \u201cclassic teal blue cruiser with a basket and brown seat,\u201d which goes along with the vintage aesthetic that many of our tweens appreciate. $199 at Walmart Buy\n\nThings to nurture creativity would also make a great gift, according Jada B., who told us she always wants \u201clots and lots of art supplies\u201d to draw and paint with, including Copic Markers, a sketchpad, and paintbrushes.\n\nD\u00e9cor gifts for tween girls\n\nLovesac Gamersac Kid's Bean Bag Chair $400 (was $500, now 20% off) \u201cI have been begging my mom for this one for a long time,\u201d says Blue, who adds that she would sit on this beanbag chair \u201call day, every day\u201d if she got it as a gift. $400 at Lovesac Buy\n\nUrban Outfitters Geo Moon Light Sculpture Another popular piece of d\u00e9cor among tweens, according to Knight, are \u201cnovelty or LED lights\u201d that can be hung in a bedroom, like this crescent-moon light sculpture from Urban Outfitters. Novelty lights like this are also popular d\u00e9cor among teen girls as well as college students, so investing in a good one or set could mean your tween will use it for years. $34 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nBree Madden Desert Times Art Print If the tween you\u2019re shopping for appreciates a boho aesthetic, like Williams, she suggests giving her some inexpensive accents such as pom-pom garlands or cactus photos, like this print.
