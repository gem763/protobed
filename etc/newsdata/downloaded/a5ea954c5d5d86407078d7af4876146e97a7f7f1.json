I had to do it.\u2019\n\nOn Arsenal\u2019s disappointing draw with Palace, Guendouzi added: \u2018We really wanted to win the game so we attacked a lot towards the end to get the third goal.\n\n\u2018We allowed spaces [for Palace on the break] but it\u2019s because we really wanted to win. It\u2019s not a mental issue. We didn\u2019t manage to hold our advantage.\n\n\u2018We knew they were a good team, with individual quality, and they played well for their goals.\n\n\u2018Zaha did well to get a penalty. It\u2019s down to us to work so we win these kinds of matches after taking the lead.\u2019\n\nMORE: Jenas reserves special praise for \u2018underrated\u2019 Liverpool captain Henderson after Tottenham win", "description": "Crystal Palace ace Wilfried Zaha has taken a swipe at Arsenal midfielder Matteo Guendouzi after the pair clashed during the thrilling Premier League draw at the Emirates.
