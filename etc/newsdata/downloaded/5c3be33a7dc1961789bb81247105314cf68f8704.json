The Justice Department raised similar arguments last month, though that was before Pelosi announced the impeachment investigation.\n\nIn a letter Thursday to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Pelosi argued, \u201cThere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no clear-cut procedure in the Constitution for launching an impeachment inquiry, leaving many of these questions about obstruction untested in court, said Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no specification in the Constitution in what does and does not constitute a more formal impeachment inquiry or investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cOne can argue if they\u2019re in an impeachment investigation, they\u2019re in an impeachment.\u201d\n\nGiuliani dismissed the entire premise of the impeachment inquiry, which is centered on Trump asking Ukraine to investigate his possible political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThe president was not tasking Ukraine to investigate a political opponent,\u201d Giuliani told The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cHe wanted an investigation into a seriously conflicted former vice president of the United States who damaged the reputation of the United States in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have sought to use their declared impeachment investigation to bolster their case to access all sorts of documents from the administration, most recently secret grand jury information that underpinned special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. They have also threatened to use the administration\u2019s refusal to turn over documents and make witnesses available to potentially form an article of impeachment over \u201cobstruction\u201d of the congressional inquiry.\n\nWhere courts have generally required congressional oversight requests to demonstrate a legitimate legislative purpose, impeachment requests could be wide-ranging.\n\nIt is unclear if Democrats would wade into a lengthy legal fight with the administration over documents and testimony \u2014 or if they would just move straight to considering articles of impeachment.\n\nPelosi has sought to avoid a vote on the impeachment probe for the same reason she resisted, for months, liberal calls to try to remove the president: It would force moderate House Democrats to make a politically risky vote.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, is trying to force the question on Democrats, as it seeks to raise the political cost for their impeachment investigation and to animate the president\u2019s supporters ahead of the 2020 election.", "description": "The White House is preparing to formally object to Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as soon as Friday, saying it won\u2019t cooperate with the probe because it was...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ880_white__ZG_20190907233409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
