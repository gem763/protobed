The robust report beat economists\u2019 expectations and came on the heels of stronger spending in July than initially estimated, a 0.8% rise. The data provide reassurance that household spending remains an economic bulwark against signs of a global slowdown, though perhaps not enough to prevent some softening in U.S. growth in the third quarter.\n\nThe increase in retail sales in August was driven by a 1.8% jump in spending on vehicles, a sign consumers felt comfortable enough in their finances to make large purchases. They also spent more online, on building materials and on sporting goods.\n\nStill, outside of motor vehicles and parts, retail sales were flat in August, and without both vehicles and gasoline they rose a tepid 0.1%. Consumers spent less on food, dining out, and at furniture and department stores last month.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have your shopping habits changed recently? How so? Join the conversation below.\n\nThat softness in core retail sales prompted downgrades to forecasts for gross-domestic-product growth in the third quarter. Both the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow model and forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers\u2019 forecast dipped to a 1.9% seasonally adjusted annual rate.\n\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a 2.0% rate in the second quarter and a 3.1% pace in the first.\n\nFriday\u2019s Commerce report doesn\u2019t track spending on most services, such as health care and housing, and the figures aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation. Retail sales account for about a quarter of all consumer spending.\n\nConsumers are the main driver of the U.S. economy, and they continue to benefit from a low unemployment rate and rising wages in the 11th year of the current economic expansion.\n\nRetail spending offers vital support to other parts of the economy struggling with trade-related uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of strength outside consumption,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics Ltd., noting weakness in business investment, corporate profits and exports. Yet since consumer spending accounts for such a large share of economic output, \u201ca strong consumer can bail you out of weakness in other areas,\u201d he added.\n\nMatt Moore, a sales manager at an automotive dealership in Nicholasville, Ky., recently bought a used motorboat, a purchase his family had been mulling since last year.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s been really good,\u201d Mr. Moore said, with the local economy supported by jobs in the equestrian and auto industries.\n\nAuto makers Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. both reported strong American sales in August, which analysts attributed in part to lower short-term interest rates. August is a key month for auto dealers to whittle down their stockpiles of older models.\n\nData on retail sales can be volatile from month to month, although the broader trend shows sales continue to rise. From a year earlier, retail sales increased 4.1% in August.\n\nThe finance chief of retailer Urban Outfitters Inc. earlier this month said, \u201cIt feels like the consumer is still in a good place; it feels like the economy is still in a good place.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year was obviously an incredibly strong year,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Frank J. Conforti said at a retailing conference Sept. 5. \u201cMaybe there was a bit of euphoria or something driving purchase behavior relative to tax benefit, but everything still feels very strong.\u201d\n\nWhile consumer spending remained strong as the third quarter progressed, the outlook for the months ahead hinges on the trade situation and the labor market.\n\nRelated Video Here's the truth about the so-called, \"retail apocalypse,\" it's more of a transformation.

Hager/The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe unemployment rate was a low 3.7% in August, although the pace of job gains slowed, the Labor Department said last week. That suggests that a global economic slowdown isn\u2019t driving the U.S. into recession but has dented growth. Average hourly earnings climbed 3.2% from August 2018, putting spending power in consumers\u2019 wallets.\n\nWhile mounting global uncertainty and trade tensions have taken a toll on the manufacturing sector and business investment, consumer confidence picked up slightly at the start of September. The University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary index of consumer sentiment rose to 92.0, from the end-of-August reading of 89.8.\n\nThe continuing trade war and the uncertainty tariffs have engendered are a wild card for U.S. businesses and consumers, economists say. The U.S. and China have both made goodwill gestures in recent days.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump delayed a new round of tariff increases on $250 billion of imports from China that would have taken effect Oct. 1. China then moved to exempt purchases of U.S. soybeans, pork and other agricultural products from punitive tariffs.\n\n\u2014Likhitha Butchireddygari contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "description": "Spending on vehicles drove strong retail sales in August, suggesting American shoppers continue to support the economy at a time of heightened global uncertainty.", "authors": ["Harriet Torry"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107034/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
