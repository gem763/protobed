But then that opportunity seemingly started slipping away.\n\nFirst, tight end Mark Andrews dropped a perfectly-placed pass in the end zone. Then, center Matt Skura couldn\u2019t hear Jackson clap for the ball because of the deafening cheers of the Seahawks faithful and drew a delay of game penalty, after which Jackson slammed the ball \u2014 once he finally did get it \u2014 to the turf in rage.\n\nTwo plays later, with his team facing fourth-and-2, coach John Harbaugh was content to settle for a field goal to break a 13-13 tie. But nah, man. That complacency didn\u2019t sit well with Jackson. As the field goal unit trotted onto the field, the seething second-year quarterback made a beeline for his coach and demanded a change in play calls.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018We\u2019re going for it,\u2019\u201d Jackson later recounted. \u201cI told him to go for it because we needed to score. We had moved the ball down the field twice. We\u2019re not kicking a field goal because Russell Wilson\u2019s getting the ball again, and if we didn\u2019t score, it might look ugly.\u201d\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 7 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nMore: Kyle Shanahan gives game ball to Mike Shanahan after 49ers' win over Redskins\n\nHarbaugh listened and promptly called timeout to swap units. He told Jackson he was putting the ball in his hands.\n\nAs he strode back onto the field, everything about Jackson\u2019s body language spoke to the frustration and determination that boiled within him. So it wasn\u2019t at all surprising when he took the shotgun snap, sprinted up the middle on a designed run called \u201cquarterback power,\u201d slipped between defenders and scored from 8 yards out.\n\n\u201cI just got mad,\u201d Jackson told USA TODAY Sports during a talk in front of his locker a short time after helping carry to his Ravens to a 30-16 victory on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019d already been down there twice and came away with just six points when it should\u2019ve been 14 to whatever. ... Aint no way we can put our defense back out there with three points. That wasn\u2019t going to help us. \u2026 When I took that snap, knew I had to get the first down. Everyone was outside, so I hit the lane, got the first down and scored, actually.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s touchdown run, which came with 1:24 left in the third quarter, ignited a Baltimore squad that had struggled to find firm footing both literally and figuratively on a rain-soaked day at CenturyLink Field. But the play did more than spark a 17-3 scoring run that the Ravens used to clinch their fifth victory of the season.\n\nFor one, Jackson also made good on a promise. Sunday\u2019s game represented both a homecoming and shot at vindication for Ravens safety Earl Thomas.\n\nThe last time Seattle fans saw Thomas, he was in their their uniform, riding on the back of the medical cart with a broken leg and giving coach Pete Carroll the finger. He had played that day despite not having a long-term contract from the team \u2014 a deal he believed he had earned \u2014 and one of his greatest fears, a season-ending injury, happened. Seattle never did extend that contract offer to the six-time Pro Bowl selection, and he signed with Baltimore in free agency.\n\nSo, throughout the week leading up to Thomas\u2019 return to Seattle, Jackson kept telling his teammate, \u201cI\u2019m going to put you on my back, put the team on my back if I got to, and we are going to win.\u201d\n\nJackson rushed for 116 yards and the touchdown on 14 carries and passed for another 143 yards. The Ravens\u2019 defense added two touchdowns \u2014 a 67-yard interception returned for a touchdown by cornerback Marcus Peters in the second quarter, and an 18-yard fumble recovery return by cornerback Marlon Humphrey with 3:37 left in the game. But teammates, including Thomas, credited Jackson for energizing the Ravens in their definitive final quarter-and-a-half.\n\n\u201cLamar Jackson \u2014 I can\u2019t say enough about that cat, bro,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWhen we needed him, he came through with his legs and his arm.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s performance carried greater meaning on a grander scale, however.\n\nThe sequence that led to led up to his touchdown run represented another level of maturation for Jackson, who continues his ascension from promising project player to bona fide NFL franchise quarterback and game-changer.\n\nJackson meant no disrespect as he barked at Harbaugh, insisting a deviation from his original plans. His demanding the ball didn\u2019t represent a lack of faith in his teammates. Instead, Jackson was simply taking complete ownership of Baltimore\u2019s offense and chances to win. His insistence on carrying the group reflected the maturation, confidence and determination necessary to elevate the franchise to the ranks of contenders.\n\nThe AFC features the New England Patriots and a pack of hopefuls without clear distinction. With the Kansas City Chiefs having lost three straight and facing the likelihood of missing Patrick Mahomes for three weeks, according to reports, the Ravens have a very real opportunity to distinguish themselves as their quarterback grows up in front of their eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that his development remains a process. He displays big-play passing ability but also displays a need for improved accuracy. However, his decision-making has improved dramatically from his rookie season. And his aggressive mindset and leadership compensate for his inexperience and any lingering deficiencies. Ask any Ravens player, and they will tell you that Jackson makes them believe, and that\u2019s half the battle.\n\n\u201cHe shows a lot of resilience and character, able to step up when the game is on the line,\u201d running back Mark Ingram told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cHe\u2019s only going to get better. \u2026 Everything y\u2019all see, he\u2019s going to continue to improve. Things that he\u2019s already good at, he\u2019s only going to improve. You\u2019re just going to see his stock keep rising.\u201d\n\nThe respect that Jackson commands extends beyond his own locker room. Everyone from Wilson to Jadeveon Clowney sang his praises following Sunday\u2019s game, and Seahawks players discussed both the fear that Jackson strikes when he takes off running and their admiration for his passing ability, which they deem underappreciated.\n\nEveryone wants to be respected for what they do. But Jackson \u2014 in another reflection of maturity \u2014 cares about just one thing for now: achieving Baltimore\u2019s ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl. He is careful to point out that he and the Ravens really haven\u2019t accomplished anything. Less than an hour after the game had ended, his mind already had shifted forward to the next hurdle.\n\n\u201cReally, we got another W, what we want and needed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a bye week coming up, and it\u2019s time to get ready for the Patriots. It\u2019s not like we won the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.", "description": "When the Ravens planned to settle for a field goal, Lamar Jackson got mad.
