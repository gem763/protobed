That frustration amongst members will manifest itself, and I think that is all that happened.\u201d\n\nMr McCluskey also sought to play down the resignation of Andrew Fisher, one of the Labour leader\u2019s closest aides, who authored the 2017 election manifesto.\n\nMr Fisher reportedly warned that the party would not win the next general election, and walked out last Saturday.\n\nBut Mr McCluskey said he was not leaving yet, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s made it clear that family commitments \u2013 he\u2019s got a young family \u2013 and an incredibly high pressure job, he wants to have a better work life balance.\u201d\n\nMr Fisher will be helping with the election, so he did not \u201cresign in a fit of pique\u201d, the union leader added.", "description": "Senior Labour figures should back Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit or \u201cstep aside\u201d, a powerful union leader has said.
