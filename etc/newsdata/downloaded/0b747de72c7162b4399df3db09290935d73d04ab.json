You\u2019re pretty much just looking out to another building,\u201d Mr Shik said.\n\n\u201cIt is an entry-level studio \u2014 you won\u2019t find cheaper than this,\u201d he said of the unit which is marketed with a price range of between $295,000 and $324,000.\n\nThe 24sq m ground floor studio, however, does have its plus sides.\n\nLocated on Ward Ave in Potts Point, the pint-sized property is in the bustling heart of the Kings Cross district surrounded by eateries and is close to the train station, has a renovated kitchen, and looks great on paper.\n\nIt has most recently been rented out at $330 a week, a gross rental return of more than 5 per cent. \u201c(That\u2019s) really good for Sydney right now. To be honest, it\u2019s a real cash cow,\u201d Mr Shik said.\n\nThe median price of an apartment in the Greater Sydney area is $699,000, while the median for a unit in the Sydney council area, where the Potts Point unit is located, is $850,000, according to CoreLogic.\n\nMORE: Ex-Giant seals move to Melbourne with sale\n\nBomera in Potts Point sells for $34 million\n\nBanks have often shied away from issuing loans for properties under 40sqm but the high rental returns would solve this issue, Mr Shik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too small to get finance, if you\u2019ve got a big enough deposit of more than 20 per cent. So it would really depend on your lender and your personal circumstances when it comes to getting a loan,\u201d Mr Shik said.\n\n\u201cIt might even be a cash buyer who is looking at taking advantage of today\u2019s market,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an art deco block of 41, the unit has a gas kitchen with soft-close cabinetry, an original bathroom, a security intercom but no internal laundry. He is also selling a car space across the road for $110,000 for buyers keen to match the two.", "description": "It is a real Sydney real estate unicorn \u2014 a property sporting a price tag that is so low that it\u2019ll knock you over.
