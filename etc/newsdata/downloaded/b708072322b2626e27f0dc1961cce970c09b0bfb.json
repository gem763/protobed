The man in the photo on the right is unrelated to the suspected bombmaker\n\nSgt. Jeremy R. McQueary (left), 27, and Lance Cpl. Larry M. Johnson (right), 19, were killed in an explosion in February 2010. Golsteyn believed the Afghan he killed was responsible for their deaths\n\nGolsteyn, who was leading a team of Army Special Forces troops at the time, believed that the bombmaker, known only as Rasoul, was responsible for an explosion that killed two US Marines - Sgt. Jeremy R. McQueary, 27, and Lance Cpl. Larry M. Johnson, 19.\n\nThe Golsteyn case was bounced around since 2011 when he told the CIA during a polygraph test in a job interview that he had shot and killed the man in February 2010 in Marjah.\n\nThe Army Criminal Investigation Command, acting on information from the CIA, looked into the incident, but could never find anyone to corroborate Golsteyn's claim and couldn't find any remains of the Afghan national, possibly because they were burned in a trash pit.\n\nAccording to an Army investigation report, Golsteyn buried the victim in an unmarked grave, then dug up the corpse, carried it back to the base and burned it in a trash pit.\n\nCID, however, concluded the soldier committed the offenses of murder and conspiracy based on the interview provided by the CIA and moved to reprimand him, according to an Army memo.\n\nThe Army revoked Golsteyn's Special Forces designation and the Silver Star he was awarded for heroism during a Taliban attack on his base in Helmand Province.\n\nTwo years later, Golsteyn appeared on a Fox News special called 'How We Fight,' in which he told host Brett Baier that he killed the Afghan because letting him go would have led to additional problems.\n\nTrump has in the past threatened to intervene in other cases of suspected war crimes by American military personnel, including that of Edward Gallagher (seen left in July with his wife, Andrea), the Navy SEAL who was acquitted of murdering an ISIS fighter while serving in Iraq\n\nHe said: 'You realize quickly that you make things worse. It is an inevitable outcome that people who are cooperating with coalition forces, when identified, will suffer some terrible torture or be killed.'\n\nGolsteyn's interview on Fox News breathed new life into the case and reportedly prompted the CID to reopen the investigation.\n\nAccording to testimony and documents, Golsteyn led about 80 troops in a four-hour firefight in the Taliban stronghold of Marjah in February 2010.\n\nHe repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire as he helped evacuate a wounded Afghan soldier and directed airstrikes against the Taliban, which earned him the Silver Star medal.\n\nIn November 2011, about two months before being promoted from captain to major, Golsteyn told the CIA during a polygraph test that on February 22, before that medal-winning battle, he shot and killed the bombmaker whom he blamed for the explosion that killed the Marines.\n\nHe recounted that the day after that explosion in a bazaar, two Afghan men walked up to the US military compound with a third, bound Afghan who they said was responsible, according to testimony.\n\nRasoul was released when no bombmaking material was found.\n\nSoon after, the alleged bombmaker was shot while walking along a path in Marjah, according to testimony.\n\nMaj. Mathew Golsteyn, who has pleaded not guilty, will be court-martialed on December 2 in Fort Bragg. He is seen here in June\n\nThe Army's Criminal Investigative Division, acting on the CIA's tip, could find no one who corroborated Golsteyn's claim to have killed the bombmaker, nor could it find any cremated remains of the Afghan.\n\nDespite that, investigators said 'Golsteyn committed the offenses of murder and conspiracy based on the interview provided by the CIA.'\n\nGolsteyn was never charged with a war crime, and the 2015 board of inquiry didn't attempt to establish whether he actually killed the Afghan. Instead, the panel considered whether he should be retained as an Army officer based on a reprimand in his personnel record.\n\nThe board determined he was guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer and he was discharged.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News on Thursday, Golsteyn blamed the Fox News interviews for his new legal troubles, but he stood by his comments to Baier.\n\nHe also insisted that he did nothing wrong on that day in February 2010 in Afghanistan.\n\n'I have had commanders look me in the face and tell me I have done nothing wrong,' Golsteyn said.", "description": "President Trump (left) on Saturday said the White House is reviewing the case of Mathew Golestyn (right), a Green Beret who is being court-martialed for murdering an alleged Taliban bombmaker.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/23/19637824-0-image-a-4_1570917944616.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
