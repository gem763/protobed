No longer able to access social housing because of the dire shortage of it, they now can\u2019t access enough housing benefit to rent privately either.\n\n\u201cThe crippling effects of the housing crisis and significant cuts to benefits have forced thousands of parents into impossible situations in order to keep a roof over their children\u2019s heads, many having to choose between crippling debt, overcrowding or homelessness.\u201d\n\nThe worst shortages were in Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, Thanet in Essex, and Stevenage in Hertfordshire, which each had only one home within the budget of people on LHA.\n\nIpswich had three, Milton Keynes had four, and Peterborough had six \u2013 all equivalent to less than 1 per cent of the private rental homes on the market in each area.\n\nPolly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said families were \u201cliving in misery because housing benefit is not doing its job\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But the allowance was frozen for four years in 2016 as part of government austerity policies, while rent has continued to climb.\n\n\u201cA four-year freeze has left it lagging dangerously behind the actual cost of private rents in this country,\u201d Ms Neate told The Independent. \u201cEvery day on the ground, Shelter\u2019s staff see the impacts of housing benefit falling short, with families unable to afford basics like food and heating.\u201d\n\nEmma Langdon, a mother of two young boys, spent several months looking for a home in Plymouth that was covered by her housing benefit entitlement after splitting up with her partner.\n\nTo avoid being made homeless, they eventually moved eight miles away from the children\u2019s school last year into a house which costs \u00a360 a month more in rent than they receive in LHA.\n\nMs Langdon, 30, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare. As well as trying to afford the rent, I\u2019m now spending \u00a350 a week on fuel to get the children to school and back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s practically impossible to find anywhere affordable that accepts people on housing benefit. If we lived nearer the children\u2019s school it would cost an extra \u00a3100 each month in rent, but at least I would save money on petrol and they would be near their friends.\u201d\n\nThe NHF found 39 out of 475 private rental homes listed in Plymouth on Zoopla in July 2019 were affordable to families on the relevant LHA rate.\n\nLess than 3 per cent of rooms within shared accommodation across England were affordable on the relevant LHA rate, which is usually the only one available to single people aged under 35.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, told The Independent: \u201cThis research is a stark reminder of the housing pressures too many people face.\n\n\u201cSince 2010, Conservative ministers have slashed funding for housing benefit and new low-cost homes, and refused to set common-sense rules to protect private renters.\n\nBoth the NHF and Shelter urged the government to end the benefit freeze, increase payments to cover at least the bottom 30 per cent of private rental homes in any local area, and build millions of new homes.\n\nThe NHF, which represents housing associations, called for an annual investment of \u00a312.8bn into social housing.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cProviding quality and fair social housing is an absolute priority. The government increased more than 360 local housing allowance rates this year, by targeting extra funding at low-income households.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve helped councils and housing associations to speed up the delivery of more homes, including social housing, through our \u00a39bn affordable homes programme \u2013 delivering over 430,000 affordable new homes since 2010.\u201d", "description": "Families on housing benefit are priced out of almost every home on the market, according to new research.
