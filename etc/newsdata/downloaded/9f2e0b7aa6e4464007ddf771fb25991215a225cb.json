You tell your little girl everything will be okay, or you tell your tween how to handle a friend kerfuffle, or you commiserate with your teen who\u2019s complaining that his teacher hates him.\n\nAs much as you may ache to make it all better, that\u2019s not the way to go.\n\n\u201cParents are taking so much responsibility for their children\u2019s mood and spirit that it feels like it\u2019s your job to reset as soon as possible,\u201d says Wendy Mogel, clinical psychologist and the author of \u201cThe Blessing of a Skinned Knee: Raising Self-Reliant Children\u201d and \u201cVoice Lessons for Parents.\u201d \u201cIt deprives them of the opportunity to be crabby and cross when they finish school or at the end of a day of camp.\u201d In other words, when we try to fix everything for our children, they don\u2019t learn how to work through their problems.\n\nPart of the reason kids may be upset when they get home is that home is \u201cthe soft landing,\u201d Mogel says. It\u2019s the place they feel comfortable enough to get it all out. \u201cThey followed all those rules all day. They were polite to all the teachers. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d\n\nAnd then they come home, she says, and their parents \u201care studying their posture, facial expression, etcetera, to reassure themselves that this is a good day. This is, in some ways, an intrusion of their natural recovery time.\u201d\n\nSometimes, says Robbye Fox, an independent education consultant and certified parent educator with the Parent Encouragement Program (PEP), \u201cthe child may just want to vent. If we rush in too quickly, we may make the issue seem bigger than it is, or that they aren\u2019t capable\u201d of handling it.\n\nShe suggests parents practice \u201creflective listening.\u201d So, for instance, a child comes home and is frustrated after a tough day in math class. The parent then says, \u201cWow, it sounds like math was really overwhelming today.\u201d Then the child says something else, and the parent reflects their feelings back to them. \u201cEach time they feel heard, it brings the emotion down and they can see it for what it is,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see any child angry and frustrated,\u201d says Emory Luce Baldwin, a marriage and family therapist and PEP certified parent educator. But you can remind them, she says, that the best feeling in the world doesn\u2019t last forever, and neither does the worst one.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to preach or teach to our kids, particularly when they are upset,\u201d she says. You can say that you are sorry they feel so bad right now or that you can understand that the day was a really tough day.\n\n\u201cShow that you\u2019re affirming that this was today, this is now. Don\u2019t use a global \u2018I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re so upset\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s terrible that you hate school,\u2019 \u201d Baldwin advises. \u201cRespond in a way that helps kids hear this isn\u2019t a permanent thing.\u201d\n\nWhen her 12- or 8-year-old is struggling, Cara Schaaf Whitmarsh reminds them that \u201cit\u2019s okay to have a bad day,\u201d and then they talk about how to make \u201ctomorrow a good day\u201d by focusing on the things that upset them. She wrote in a conversation via Facebook: \u201cWe acknowledge their feelings (anger, frustration, sadness, jealousy) and then make a game plan to help them deal with it.\u201d\n\nAlong those lines, Baldwin suggests we remind our children they can do things to make themselves feel better. Sometimes, when children (or, let\u2019s face it, adults) are upset or down, it\u2019s hard to remember there are joyful, positive things in our lives. She suggests saying, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed you like to play with the dog when you feel like this, or put that music on that you love.\u201d\n\nThere are times when an issue is larger and requires a bigger plan, conversations with teachers and more. But many times, a bad day is just that: a bad day.\n\n\u201cJust helping kids connect with what they can do to feel better\u201d is helpful, Baldwin says.\n\nA parent\u2019s role in this is to help a child build problem-solving skills. Fox says she is on a parent advisory board at a college. She often hears about students who may have taken 15 Advanced Placement courses, but they don\u2019t know how to navigate an airport. \u201cThey have no problem-solving skills or resilience.\u201d\n\nSo when your child forgets his lunch and it seems like a huge deal to him, your role is to help him rebound from that, Fox says, not just fix it or slough it off. \u201cIt\u2019s like building blocks to the next bigger problem.\u201d", "description": "They need to learn to push through, but parents can help.", "authors": ["Amy Joyce", "Writer", "Editor For On Parenting", "Amy Joyce Is A Writer", "Editor For On Parenting."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ajlwvgskiwr4IElyA7CMEF44ZSE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OOXBCWVTCAI6TCKJL43P7ETQNY.jpg"}
