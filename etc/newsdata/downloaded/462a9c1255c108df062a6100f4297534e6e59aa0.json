Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on Oct. 31. Parliament passed a law demanding that the prime minister request an extension if a withdrawal deal has not been agreed by mid-October. But Johnson has continued to insist that Britain will leave with or without a deal at the end of the month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJohnson\u2019s most substantive plan so far, presented to E.U. leaders Wednesday, tries to address issues in Northern Ireland \u2014 the major barrier to a withdrawal agreement. But his written proposal crosses several E.U. red lines. Some policymakers assessed that it would be more damaging to the European Union than the economic and political instability that could come with an abrupt \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit without any transition period to buffer the way.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson offers a new Brexit plan, new suspension of Parliament\n\n\u201cSafeguarding peace and stability on the island of Ireland, protection of citizens and E.U.\u2019s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal,\u201d read a statement from the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit oversight committee. \u201cThe U.K. proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise\u201d by Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nThe European Parliament can veto any deal approved by the leaders of E.U. member states, who make up the European Council.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany European leaders appear to be deferring \u2014 for now \u2014 to Ireland because of how directly it would be affected by the terms of a Brexit withdrawal.\n\n\u201cThere are elements of this proposal that simply will not be part of any deal,\u201d Irish deputy leader Simon Coveney said Thursday.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said he had spoken to both Ireland\u2019s and Britain\u2019s leaders Thursday. \u201cWe stand fully behind Ireland,\u201d he tweeted. To Johnson, he said, \u201cWe remain open but still unconvinced.\u201d\n\nThere was similar skepticism from the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive body.\n\n\u201cThere are problematic points in the U.K.\u2019s proposal, and further work is needed,\u201d said European Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough British Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay had admonished that the ball was in the European Union\u2019s court, Bertaud emphasized, \u201cThis work is for the U.K. to do, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are not going to be the ones left holding the bag, the ball or any other kind of object,\u201d she added \u2014 reflecting a fear on the European side that Johnson is setting them up to take the blame for a Brexit failure.\n\nThe biggest disagreement centers on what to do about the border between Northern Ireland, which is leaving the European Union along with the rest of Britain, and the Republic of Ireland, which is staying.\n\nSince the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence, people and goods have been able to pass from one side of the border to the other without any checks. The European Union has maintained that keeping the border open and invisible is critical to ensuring that violence does not flare again.\n\nAD\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s proposal would lead to some form of customs controls, setting off nervousness on the island of Ireland.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur objective is very clear \u2014 we don\u2019t want to see any customs posts between north and south, nor do we want to see any tariffs or restrictions on trade between north and south,\u201d Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a Thursday news conference. \u201cThey were all abolished in the 1990s, and we don\u2019t want to go back to that.\u201d\n\nHe said he appreciated Johnson\u2019s assurances that there would be no new customs infrastructure. But Varadkar said those assurances seemed to be contradicted by Johnson\u2019s written proposal.\n\nAlso making the Europeans anxious: Johnson\u2019s plan would require the European Union to maintain a loosely controlled border with a neighbor that already has said it wants to go its own way on taxation and regulation. E.U. businesses fear such a step could cost them by opening the door to smuggling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBrexit is not a game or a bargaining process. We are not ready to do everything in order to have a deal,\u201d French European Affairs Minister Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin told the CNews broadcaster. \u201cThe United Kingdom cannot become a fiscal paradise nor an exporter of goods that do not respect the health and safety rules established by the European Union.\u201d\n\nIf there is any chance for a deal at a summit of E.U. leaders that begins Oct. 17, serious negotiations would have to begin immediately, policymakers say. But those talks don\u2019t appear imminent.\n\nThe prospects for approval of Johnson\u2019s plan by the British Parliament are also uncertain. Johnson seems to have won the backing of some hard-line Brexiteers who voted against previous Brexit proposals. But he has been hostile toward opposition lawmakers whose support he also needs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn slammed Johnson\u2019s government Thursday for seeking \u201ca Trump-deal Brexit that would crash our economy\u201d and undermine workplace rights and environmental standards.\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s contributed to this report.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson accused of groping a journalist\n\nWidower of murdered lawmaker and Boris Johnson\u2019s sister join criticism of prime minister\u2019s language in Brexit debate\n\nAfter Supreme Court defeat, Boris Johnson taunts Parliament\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "Europeans said that Britain needed to make major concessions to pull off a deal by the Oct. 31 deadline.", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dLh02BCnh1QCIqKUMhsmjipsupo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J5VMYWHF4EI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg"}
