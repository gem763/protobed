It is just another Democrat Hoax!\u201d\n\nThe president has said in recent days that the White House was \u201ctrying to find out\u201d the identity of the whistleblower, while the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys have said they are concerned about their client\u2019s safety.\n\nREPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets come amid the political chaos surrounding the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which was filed in August to the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson.\n\nThe complaint alleged that during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump pressured him to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter regarding business dealings in Ukraine. The whistleblower alleged that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nJoe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Biden's son Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board. Biden's allies say his intervention was driven by corruption concerns.\n\nThe White House last week released a transcript of the call, which confirmed the allegation that Trump did, in fact, seek an investigation \u2014 though Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether his comments constituted improper pressure.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee then released the declassified whistleblower complaint, which acknowledges that much of the allegations were based on second-hand information and cited \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\u201d The intelligence community inspector general now, though, says that the whistleblower did claim firsthand knowledge of the incident, in addition to other information from sources.\n\nBut the president\u2019s tweets highlight inconsistencies in the complaint. Republicans specifically have questioned why the whistleblower\u2019s sources in the White House didn\u2019t file a complaint themselves.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of whistleblower complaints, I generally think of someone with firsthand knowledge of the events in question,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been an ally of the president, said.\n\nThe complaint also stated that Trump made a \u201cspecific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike\" \u2014 a request that does not appear in the declassified transcript of the call released by the Trump administration. Trump mentioned CrowdStrike, but did not demand the server.\n\nMCCONNELL SAYS HE'D HAVE 'NO CHOICE' BUT TO TAKE UP IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES IF HOUSE APPROVES THEM\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill, defended his handling of the whistleblower complaint, while calling the matter \"unprecedented.\"\n\nMaguire also stressed that the complaint essentially was \"hearsay,\" not \"corroborated by other folks.\"\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Tuesday renewed calls to learn more about the Ukraine whistleblower\u2019s identity, suggesting he should be allowed to \u201cinterview & learn everything about\u201d the individual whose complaint sparked a formal impeachment inquiry in the House.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
