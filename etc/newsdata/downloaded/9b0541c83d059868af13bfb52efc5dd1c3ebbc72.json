Instead, it has opened up more access to inexpensive, often bare-bones options outside of the exchanges.\n\nInsurers initially mispriced their plans, then settled into a more stable market, then freaked out in response to many of Trump\u2019s actions, and are now settling back down again.\n\nOur thought bubble: The Affordable Care Act is neither collapsing nor thriving. It is, like all of us, hangin\u2019 in there.\n\nGo deeper: The ACA is smaller, weaker and more liberal than Obama intended", "description": "Metrics are improving because they got so much worse over the past several years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/1zfkpJQZhwnLas5lfrmaepgcEYY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/23/1571827019921.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
