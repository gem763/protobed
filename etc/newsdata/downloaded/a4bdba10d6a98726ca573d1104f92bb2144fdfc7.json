Indications are \u2013 from previous statements by Mr Erdogan \u2013 that they have ambitious plans for this part of what used to be independent Syria.\n\nThey would like to resettle 3 million mostly Syrian Arab refugees in a place the Kurds regard as a homeland. Indeed, far from the creation of a Kurdish autonomous state across parts of Syria, Turkey and Iraq \u2013 as is the dream of the Kurdish people \u2013 they will find themselves host to an unwilling Arab population, and in any case be under indefinite Turkish occupation.\n\nAs in the case of Northern Cyprus, where Turkish troops first landed in 1974, the de facto annexation of northern Syria and the nascent Kurdistan into Turkey will most likely prove essentially permanent \u2013 and be deeply resented.\n\nFor Turkey will not be able to suppress the national aspirations of the Kurds, and no amount of brutality will work against them. The Kurds have simply swapped oppression by Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime for that by Isis and, now, by the authoritarian nationalists of the Erdogan government.\n\nNor will Turkey know what to do with the gangs of Isis fighters suddenly released to regroup and carry out fresh jihad \u2013 directly this time against Turkish forces, as well as against Kurdish forces, depending on where the balance of advantage for Isis happens to lie.\n\nIf the track record of Isis is anything to go by, it will vary its tactics and carry its terror campaign into Turkey itself, as well as back into Europe, from where many of the terrorists originated. Turkey\u2019s enemies may seek to assist the terror group, or the Kurds and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in another regional proxy war. They will not simply pack up and go home.\n\nAt a stroke, in the space of one petulant phone call, Donald Trump has succeeded in completing the creation of a zone of war and instability stretching from the Greek border with Turkey down to Yemen and across Iraq, Iran and all the way to Afghanistan, Kashmir and the Pakistani border with India.\n\nPresident Trump has warned Turkey not to harm his former Kurdish allies and the SDF, who did as much as anyone to help extirpate Isis from its self-proclaimed and previously vast regional \u201ccaliphate\u201d. The warnings are unlikely to hold when the fighting starts in earnest.\n\nA whole new Middle Eastern war is about to begin, with all the additional instability it brings. It brings the fighting that much closer to the EU, and for the first time, involves the direct exposure of a Nato member state to a full-scale military operation. When, as is possible, the Turkish forces suffer defeats, and setbacks turn into a rout, what then will Turkey\u2019s Nato allies \u2013 including the US and most of the EU nations \u2013 do to assist?\n\nThe US remains the foundation of the western alliance and the most powerful power on the planet, the only one able to stand up to the likes of Russia and China, and a historical force of freedom and liberation.\n\nHowever, it has more recently been an inept operator and an unreliable ally. Ask the South Koreans, the European Nato members threatened with US withdrawal, Canada and Mexico \u2013 who can rely on Trump\u2019s America to stick with them, to pay any price, to bear any burden?\n\nDespite the loss of American lives and the financial and military commitment to defeat the \u201caxis of evil\u201d and win the wars on terror, mistakes and blunders have left America as more of a loser than winner. President Trump wanted to disentangle America from the Middle East, and keep his campaign pledge to repatriate the US\u2019s scattered forces around the globe. However, he has made matters for his country, let alone those old allies left behind undefended, much, much worse.", "description": "While the now notorious telephone call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president about Joe Biden and his son has led to an attempt at impeachment, the phone conversation the US president had with Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey may prove the more momentous for the US, and indeed the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/13/Donald-Trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
