The aim is for students and others from around the world to speak in one voice about the impending effects of climate change on the planet.\n\nThe strike will culminate in New York when Thunberg, who has been nominated for a Nobel prize for her climate activism, will spearhead a march at the home of the United Nations headquarters.\n\nThe UN summit brings together world leaders to discuss climate change mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels.\n\nIn Australia, climate change policy has become a political football as the coal-rich country grapples with its renewable energy targets.\n\nAustralian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told parliament on Thursday that students should not take part in the protest movement. \u201cWhen school is sitting, students should go to school,\u201d he said.\n\nDanielle Porepilliasana, a high school student in Sydney\u2019s inner west, said climate change was the biggest threat to her generation and politicians needed to wake up to the challenge.\n\n\u201cWorld leaders from everywhere are telling us that students need to be at school doing work,\u201d said Porepilliasana, wearing anti-coal earrings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see them at their parliaments doing their jobs for once.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heatwaves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, scientists say.\n\nCarbon emissions climbed a record high last year, despite a warning from the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October that output of the gases must be slashed over the next 12 years to stabilise the climate.\n\nOrganisers said the demonstrations would take different forms around the world, but all aim to promote awareness of climate change and demand political action to curb contributing factors to climate change, namely carbon emissions.", "description": "Thousands of school students walked out of their classrooms and onto Australian streets on Friday to kick off a global strike demanding world leaders gathering for a UN Climate Action Summit adopt urgent measures to stop an environmental catastrophe.", "authors": ["Hans Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431836088&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J06R", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
