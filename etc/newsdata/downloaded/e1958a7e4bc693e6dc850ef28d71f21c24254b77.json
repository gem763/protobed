Hospitals are barely functioning.\n\nThe crisis is beginning to ease in Port-au-Prince as more oil arrives. But the rest of the country remains paralyzed.\n\nIn Haiti\u2019s Cap Haitian region and rural northeast, the humanitarian situation is dire. For over a year, a severe drought has left people with hardly any access to water. Crops have shriveled and the Dominican Republic just closed its border with Haiti, so food that once came from there is in short supply.\n\nA Failing Economic Model\n\nHaiti\u2019s fuel shortages are one manifestation of the political crisis that has destabilized the country since the violent 1991 coup d'etat that replaced President Jean-Bertrand Aristide with a repressive military regime.\n\nThat three-year dictatorship left Haiti\u2019s democracy fragile. Haiti has had 11 prime ministers since 2010. The deeply dysfunctional government of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse has not yet passed a 2019 budget.\n\nThis prevents the government from receiving the international loans that it relies on to fund over 20% of its operating budget. As a result, the government owes US$130 million in arrears to its fuel suppliers.\n\nHaiti\u2019s financial struggles are also, in large part, the result of an ill-conceived economic system that has failed to meet Haiti\u2019s needs for over a century.\n\nEver since the American military occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934, its economic and social policies have been designed to attract foreign investment. The plan, which was crafted in the 1910s and 1920s by the U.S. military government, was to \u201cdevelop\u201d this rural Caribbean country by making it an appealing operating environment for U.S. firms.\n\nIn practice, that meant keeping Haitian wages, corporate taxes and tariffs low. In exchange, the theory went, foreign investment would bring infrastructure development and jobs, benefiting all Haitians.\n\nAmerican agro-corporations began profitably cultivating cash crops like coffee, bananas and sugar in Haiti in the early 20th century.\n\nIn 1926, American businessmen backed by the American military government seized more than 12,000 acres of fertile land from Haitian peasants in the Cap Haitian region to grow sisal, a fibrous plant used in weaving. To make room for this massive industrial operation, thousands of families were evicted from their land.\n\nThe intensive cultivation of just one crop over two decades so depleted the soil that food production across Cap Haitian was threatened.\n\nThis process of exploitation followed by scarcity and environmental degradation has repeated itself for decades.\n\nChasing low-wage labor and free trade, U.S. corporations and military agencies have established sugar cane plantations, rubber plantations and textile factories in Haiti for the past 100 years, with similarly disappointing results for workers and the environment.\n\nEmpty Industrial Parks\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist who studies industrialization and informal economies in Haiti. Over the past seven years, I\u2019ve spoken with dozens of Haitian factory workers, small farmers and entrepreneurs about their experiences with this kind of foreign-funded development project.\n\nAfter decades of extremely business-friendly policies, three quarters of Haitians still live on less than $2.40 a day. The United States, Haiti\u2019s main trade partner, has continued to enjoy the favorable trade policies it created in the early 1900s, which allow U.S. companies to sell government-subsidized American rice and sugar to Haitians at prices that have left Haitian farmers unable to compete.\n\nOne modern development project is painfully emblematic of Haiti\u2019s failed economic model.\n\nThe Caracol Industrial Park, which opened in northeast Haiti in 2012, was supposed to be the centerpiece of the reconstruction effort in Haiti after its devastating 2010 earthquake. Developed by the Clinton Foundation, U.S. State Department and the Inter-American Development Bank, Caracol was supposed to create 60,000 jobs in the garment and assembly industries on farmland that, at the time, fed 4,000 people.", "description": "The crisis is beginning to ease in Port-au-Prince as\u00a0more oil arrives.
