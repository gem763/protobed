He faces 5,230 counts of accessory to murder for killings while he was at Stutthof from 1944 to 1945.\n\nAsked Friday by the presiding judge what exactly he saw from his sentry\u2019s watchtower, Dey replied: \u201cThat people were led in, into the gas chamber, that the door was locked,\u201d news agency dpa reported.\n\nHe said he heard screams and banging shortly after, but added: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that they were being gassed.\u201d\n\nDey said that about 20 or 30 prisoners were led in, and that they didn\u2019t resist. He said he couldn\u2019t say whether they were men or women, because their heads were shaved, or whether they were Jews or other prisoners. And he also couldn\u2019t say what happened afterward.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone come out,\u201d he said.\n\nHe testified that, on another occasion, he saw a group of 10 or 15 men being led into the gas chamber, but they then came out and were taken to the crematorium building by people in white overalls. He heard that the prisoners were supposed to work outside the camp and had to be checked first, he said.\n\nDey said he and around 400 other soldiers were brought to Stutthof in June or July 1944 and he didn\u2019t know at the time what kind of people were incarcerated there. He said he heard only \u201crumors\u201d that they included political prisoners and Jews.\n\nThough there is no evidence that Dey was involved in a specific killing at the camp near Danzig, today the Polish city of Gdansk, prosecutors argue that as a guard he helped the camp function.\n\nDespite his age, Dey is being tried in a juvenile court because he was 17 when he started serving at Stutthof.\n\nHe faces a possible six months to 10 years in prison if convicted. There are no consecutive sentences under German law.", "description": "A 93-year-old former guard at the Nazis\u2019 Stutthof concentration camp testified he once saw people being led into the gas chamber.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Bruno-Dey-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
