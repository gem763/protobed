One was where he was dressed as Aladdin and made up in blackface at an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party at the private high school at which he was teaching. He reportedly was the only one to wear a costume and his face and his hands were blacked up. He was a 29 years old. The second incident was a picture from high school were he appeared in a show singing \u201cThe Banana Boat\u201d song. He wore blackface and an afro.\n\nThe last incident was a video that Global News Canada found. But their copy was grainy and difficult to see in detail. Now another Canadian outlet, The Post Millennial, has posted a higher quality version of the video.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Redstate.Com Nick-Arama More-Video-Of-Justin-Trudeau-And-This-Is-The-Worst-Yet"], "top_image": ""}
