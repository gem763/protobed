Mitt Romney (R-UT) has raised some objections to Trump\u2019s actions but could easily flip-flop down the line, Karl said that he\u2019s \u201chearing that Republicans don\u2019t like defending this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d McCain reacted. \u201cBut you have to understand the skepticism because again, impeachment every day. And we all trust you, obviously.\u201d\n\nCo-host Abby Huntsman, a close friend of McCain\u2019s and a former Fox Newser herself, interjected that the whistleblower complaint that pushed this into the spotlight may have come from a secondhand source, thus further raising skepticism over the complaint\u2019s veracity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I point to what the president himself said,\u201d Karl retorted.", "description": "\u201cI have a question for conservatives,\u201d McCain said. \u201cHow bad is this really?\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569255688/meghan-karl-view_wrtlut", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
