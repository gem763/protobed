Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren if one became the Democratic presidential nominee, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg was noncommittal. I have the utmost respect for Bloomberg, whose fiscally conservative and socially liberal views closely mirror my own, but I will vote for any Democratic nominee, even Warren or Sanders, despite my profound disagreement with their far-left agendas.\n\nIf I needed any further confirmation, it came during the second half of August. This was by no means the worst period of the Trump presidency, but it nevertheless offers a snapshot of why President Trump cannot under any circumstances be reelected. Here are 14 of the lowlights:\n\n\u2014Trump exulted when, at his urging, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to let two Democratic members of Congress visit Israel, making clear that he does not view himself as leader of the whole country. After Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D.-Mich.) refused Israel\u2019s conditions to visit her grandmother in the West Bank, Trump even tweeted, \u201cThe only real winner here is Tlaib\u2019s grandmother. She doesn\u2019t have to see her now!\u201d I can\u2019t fathom the sadism that would lead Trump to drag a political opponent\u2019s grandmother into the argument.\n\n\u2014Trump accused Jews of \u201cgreat disloyalty\u201d for not backing him despite his support for Israel, thereby perpetuating the anti-Semitic stereotype that American Jews owe their primary allegiance to Israel. He then quoted a discredited conspiracy-monger claiming Israelis \u201clove him like he is the second coming of God.\u201d (Note: Jews don\u2019t think there was a first coming.)\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\n\u2014Trump proclaimed, \u201cI am the chosen one.\u201d He later said he was joking, but this was a perfect reflection of his real megalomania.\n\n\u2014Trump expressed interest in buying Greenland. When the prime minister of Denmark rightly dismissed this idea as \u201cabsurd,\u201d Trump petulantly blasted her as \u201cnasty\u201d and canceled his visit to a staunch NATO ally that lost 43 soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\n\u2014Trump reversed his support for background checks for gun buyers \u2014 supported by 93 percent of Americans \u2014 under pressure from the gun lobby.\n\n\u2014Trump escalated his attacks on his own Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, whom he wants to scapegoat for an economic slowdown. In an unprecedented demonization of a U.S. official, the president demanded: \u201cwho is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or [Chinese] Chairman Xi [Jinping]?\u201d\n\n\u2014During the recent Group of Seven summit in France, Trump skipped a meeting on climate change and the fires in the Amazon, apparently because he doesn\u2019t care about global warming. A few days later, his administration announced plans to roll back regulations on methane, a major greenhouse gas.\n\n\u2014Trump floundered for a way out of his catastrophic trade war with China. Sounding like a Soviet central planner, he tweeted on Aug. 23: \u201cOur great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.\u201d The same day, he called Xi an \u201cenemy.\u201d Within three days, he was calling Xi \u201ca great leader\u201d and a \u201cbrilliant man\u201d and claiming he had received two phone calls from Beijing to restart talks. Chinese officials did not confirm any such calls, and two Trump aides told CNN he had lied to calm markets.\n\n\u2014Trump tried to get Vladimir Putin readmitted to the G-7 and blamed former president Barack Obama \u2014 rather than Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2014 for the Russian president\u2019s exclusion. The administration is also slow-walking military aid to Ukraine, continuing Trump\u2019s kowtowing to the Russian dictator who helped elect him.\n\n\u2014Trump suggested he might hold the next G-7 meeting at his troubled Doral resort. This would be a clear use of the president\u2019s powers to enrich himself in violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause.\n\n\u2014Trump was reported to have asked subordinates about using nuclear bombs on hurricanes. Trump denied this Axios article as \u201cfake news,\u201d meaning it\u2019s probably true.\n\n\u2014Trump promised to pardon subordinates who broke the law to build a border wall. This is another impeachable offense. The only defense that White House officials could muster was that Trump was joking. Are you laughing? I\u2019m not.\n\n\u2014Trump continued his vendetta against former FBI director James B. Comey, who exposed Trump\u2019s possible attempts to obstruct justice. A Justice Department inspector general\u2019s report found that Comey violated FBI policies but absolved him of leaking classified information, as Trump has repeatedly charged.\n\n\u2014On Friday, Trump taunted Iran by tweeting what was almost certainly a classified image of an Iranian rocket that had exploded, thereby potentially compromising U.S. intelligence capabilities.\n\nThis is by no means a comprehensive list of Trump\u2019s erratic and unpresidential behavior recently, but it gives you the flavor of a presidency whose defining features are crassness, cruelty, incompetence and \u2014 most of all \u2014 sheer craziness. I may not agree with Warren or Sanders on most issues, but I am confident they would not do any of the offensive and even impeachable acts that Trump commits with mind-numbing regularity. That is reason enough to vote for them, even if I would prefer a more moderate alternative. Saving U.S. democracy from a mad king matters more than the specific policies of his successor.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump gives a stunning display of incoherence at the G-7\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump is \u2018joking\u2019 about pardons?
