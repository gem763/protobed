And it\u2019s only a matter of time before those technologies are migrated to longer-range missiles.\u201d\n\nMr Trump says that Mr Kim committed to him during a meeting in Singapore 14 months ago that he would refrain from testing intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducting nuclear tests while negotiations are underway, and he has kept those promises even though there have been no substantive talks since a second summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February resulted in an impasse.\n\nBut North Korean state-run media made clear last week that the country feels no such limits when it comes to improving other missile technologies, saying it would never accede to the West\u2019s demand \u201cfor disarmament under pressure and appeasement of \u2018international society'.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr Kim has not been shy about touting the latest missile advances, attending many of the tests and releasing photographs of post-launch celebrations with his missile brain trust, a group of officers who have steadily continued weapons development while diplomacy has sputtered.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He recently told CBS, \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten back to the table as quickly as we would have hoped, but we\u2019ve been pretty clear all along we knew there would be bumps along the way.\u201d\n\nThe bumps, though, have gotten much larger in recent months as the North began lobbing missile after missile aloft, testing at least three new varieties. The tests have showcased the North\u2019s ability to consistently launch solid-fuel missiles that are easier to hide in the mountains and which could be quickly deployed on mobile launchers and fired before the United States could respond.\n\n\u201cKim understands what he is doing,\u201d said Mr Narang, the MIT professor. \u201cHe likely thinks Mr Trump can live with a nuclear North Korea as long as they don\u2019t test ICBMs and nuclear weapons, which would humiliate Mr Trump and take away the perception he has achieved some kind of victory\u201d with his diplomacy.\n\nAdministration officials dispute that view and say the tests are a symptom of a North desperately trying to end \u201cmaximum pressure,\u201d which is how Mr Pompeo describes the sanctions the United States has imposed on the country. And there is some evidence for his position: North Korea\u2019s official media recently described the secretary of state as a \u201cdie-hard toxin.\u201d\n\nIf there is any lesson to be taken from the latest North Korean provocations, it is that Mr Kim clearly has a maximum pressure strategy of his own.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, the country\u2019s missile tests were failing at an astoundingly high rate. Some intelligence officials and outside experts tied at least some of those setbacks to a covert Pentagon effort to sabotage the launches with cyber and electronic strikes.\n\nBut by 2017, Mr Trump\u2019s first year in office, Mr Kim had adopted new designs and conducted 14 successful launches, mostly of medium- and long-range missiles, for the first time raising the spector that he might be able to reach all of the United States.\n\nAt the same time, he conducted a series of nuclear tests, including of its largest weapon yet, which he described as a hydrogen bomb.\n\nThose successes prompted Mr Trump to first warn of \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen,\u201d then to begin the diplomatic dance towards the Singapore summit last year, the first time a sitting American president had met any member of the Kim family. After the meeting, Mr Trump said that North Korea was on the road to disarmament, telling reporters he expected they would see major results within six months.\n\nFor almost a year afterward, Mr Kim appeared to refrain from firing missiles, perhaps in the hope that the Mr Trump administration would ease sanctions.\n\nThen the diplomacy stalled at the second summit, in Hanoi. Mr Kim offered to close the North\u2019s major nuclear complex at Yongbyon \u2014 but not other nuclear facilities or any missile sites \u2014 in return for the lifting of the most severe sanctions. Trump rejected that offer at the insistence of Mr Pompeo and John R. Bolton, his hawkish national security adviser.\n\nMr Kim now appears to be reverting to the tactic that worked for him two years ago: escalating tests to demonstrate new capabilities.\n\n\u201cTheir stock-in-trade has always been to press the edge of the envelope and see what they can get away with,\u201d said Vann H. Van Diepen, a top official on weapons of mass destruction in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence until 2009.\n\nThe recent bout began in early May when the North fired a 30-foot-tall missile from an eight-wheeled truck. Analysts said it was a solid-fuel rocket that can be launched in minutes \u2013 unlike liquid-fuelled missiles, which can take hours of preparation.\n\nIn all, the North conducted eight flight tests of the new missile in May, July and August. Its maximum range was found to be roughly 430 miles, according to the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, a private group in Monterey, California.\n\nThe missile, if perfected, could target all of South Korea, including at least six US bases, and parts of southern Japan, including two large bases.\n\nNorth Korea debuted another type of missile in late July and early August, along with a new launching system. Mr Van Diepen, the former top American official on weapons of mass destruction, described the system in 38 North, a respected publication on North Korea, as a new generation of weapon that could fire an unknown number of missiles simultaneously. The older type could fire eight.\n\nThe range of the newly tested missile, he wrote, was 155 miles, about 40 miles farther than the older version. Mr Van Diepen said it would increase the North\u2019s ability to subject US and South Korean targets to \u201csaturation attacks,\u201d which can also defeat antimissile defences.\n\nNorth Korea tested a third new missile twice in early August. Analysts have yet to determine what advances it might represent.\n\nThen, late last month, the North fired two projectiles from what it called a \u201csuper-large multiple rocket launcher.\u201d Narang of MIT said the system appeared new, making it perhaps the fourth missile system to debut this year and another iteration of a multiple rocket launcher.\n\nNew York Times", "description": "As North Korea fired off a series of missiles in recent months \u2013 at least 18 since May \u2013 President Donald Trump has repeatedly dismissed their importance as short-range and \u201cvery standard\u201d tests.
