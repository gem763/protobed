Here\u2019s why.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n\nAs Hake\u2019s article stated, Ford\u2019s adjusted free cash flow in the first six months of fiscal 2019, was $2.1 billion, 80% higher than a year earlier. Of that $2.1 billion, $1.2 billion went to the company\u2019s quarterly dividend. If Ford had continued to pay its annual special dividend, it would have had to shell out approximately $600 million for it, the same amount it paid last year.\n\nFrom this perspective, my belief that Ford shouldn\u2019t have cut its 13-cent special dividend seems off the mark.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true because Ford\u2019s free cash flow is expected to drop dramatically for the rest of 2019 and into fiscal 2020. That\u2019s because it continues to implement its Global Redesign to meet the future demand for electric vehicles.\n\nAccording to Hake, because of the Global Redesign, the company won\u2019t have enough adjusted free cash flow to afford other pressing obligations, including its pension contributions and its debt repayments.\n\nIf you own Ford stock, I recommend that you read Hake\u2019s entire article. It does a very good job explaining why Ford\u2019s dividend yield is a double-edged sword.\n\nThe Special Dividend Leaves Ford With Options\n\nThe problem with regular dividends is that they become addictive. Companies brag about how many years they\u2019ve increased their annual dividend.\n\nFor companies that have increased their dividends for many years in a row, it becomes increasingly difficult to cut or suspend the dividend. If shareholders are disappointed by the reduction of a dividend, many of them will probably sell their shares.\n\nWhile the special dividend is intended to be a perk that rewards shareholders when there is excess cash, I believe Ford should use it in place of permanent dividends.\n\nIt would be up to the company to decide whether to pay out up to 50% of its free cash flow on an annual basis through one or more special dividends.\n\nThe argument against this kind of arrangement is that shareholders pile in to capture the dividend payment and then pile out after it\u2019s been paid.\n\nHowever, if the board were under no obligation to pay the special dividend, it could instead decide to use the money for other purposes, including repurchases of Ford stock, debt repayments, etc. As a result, it would be much tougher for investors to know when or if Ford would pay a special dividend.\n\nFord stock has traded under $10 for the better part of the last year. If it\u2019s really worth more than $10 per share, the company ought to be buying back F stock, not paying out quarterly dividends.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Ford Stock\n\nOver the past year, while Ford stock has soured, I\u2019ve become more of a fan.\n\nIn July, I argued that the chances were good that F stock could get to $20 within four years. A couple of months later, nothing has changed to make me think otherwise.\n\nHowever, as long as the company is obligated to pay out almost $5 billion per year of dividends, its free cash flow generation is being unnecessarily pressured.\n\nForget the dividend. Ford needs to switch to something special.\n\nAt the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Why Ford Shouldn\u2019t Cut Its Special Dividend\u00c2 on Ford Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "InvestorPlace columnist Mark Hake recently argued that Ford (NYSE:F) might not be able to afford to pay its 15-cent quarterly dividend on Ford stock.
