You can sign up for free right here.\n\nJohn Lansing becomes CEO of NPR\n\nNPR, the public radio giant that employs hundreds of journalists, is about to get a new chief executive.\n\nJohn Lansing is taking over for outgoing CEO Jarl Mohn, who has led the organization for the past five years.\n\nMohn announced his plan to step down late last year, but the search for his successor took longer than expected. He will officially hand off to Lansing in mid-October.\n\nLansing is currently the head of the US Agency for Global Media, which oversees VOA, Radio Free Europe, and other government-funded media outlets outside the United States.\n\nPaul Haaga, chair of the NPR board, said Lansing's \"deep experience as a media industry executive and practicing journalist make him ideally suited to lead NPR into its next chapter.\"\n\nNPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik spoke with Lansing , who said NPR and its member stations across the country provide \"journalism as a public service, not tied to a profit motive.\" Lansing said he defined NPR's mission as \"serving the public with information and an excellence and quality about it that makes it 'must see' on a variety of platforms.\"\n\nFOR THE RECORD, PART ONE\n\n-- At the time I'm sending this, 10pm ET, Dorian's eyewall is very close to Cape Fear, NC.

The special will air on Friday's \"Dateline NBC.\" It will re-air on MSNBC on Sunday, \"along with a Holt-moderated town hall meeting from inside another well-known prison, New York's Sing Sing,\" The AP's David Bauder reports...\n\nBloomberg Law's puzzling directive to reporters\n\nOliver Darcy emails: What is going on over at Bloomberg Law? After the Labor Department reinstated Leif Olson, an official who had been wrongly accused by the outlet of anti-Semitism, Bloomberg Law published a story about his return to the agency.\n\nBut a source told me on Thursday that reporters at Bloomberg Law were instructed not to tweet the new story out. The new story was also not promoted by Bloomberg Law's Twitter account. As many journalists pointed out on Twitter, Bloomberg Law continues to follow what can only be described as a textbook way NOT to handle an editorial failure.\n\nStill no formal correction...\n\nDarcy adds: The original Bloomberg Law article still remains up with no correction or apology to Olson. But, it was updated after Olson's Labor Department reinstatement to remove from the headline the incorrect description of his comments as \"anti-Semitic.\" An editor's note said, \"In light of the subsequent events, we removed 'Anti-Semitic' from the headline and clarified Olson's reference to those tropes.\" I checked in with Bloomberg Law on Thursday, but reps would not comment on the record...\n\nFOR THE RECORD, PART TWO\n\n-- Morgan Hertzan is Viceland's new EVP and GM.

( The Cut\n\nNow here's an idea...\n\nPoynter's Rick Edmonds writes about \"a novel idea for saving serious journalism: Give every adult American $50, via an income tax checkoff, to donate to a favorite news outlet .\" He says \"this is not the work of the proverbial crackpot blogger in her pajamas but rather a white paper from a group of seven well-credentialed academics, led by Guy Rolnik of the Stigler Center of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\" Far-fetched? Probably. But \"there is precedent for the scheme, cited by the ad hoc group as a model: For the last two local election cycles, Seattle has given citizens tax-funded vouchers to pass on as campaign contributions to a city candidate of their choice...\"\n\nThe Atlantic's paywall is up\n\nKerry Flynn has the details: Non-subscribers will only get free access to five articles per month. The digital subscription is $49.99 per year while print and digital together is $59.99. For $100 per year, subscribers receive other benefits like ad-free web browsing and podcasts.\n\nThe Atlantic's EIC Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in the announcement, \"More than 30 million people each month visit our website, read our print magazine, watch our documentaries, listen to our podcasts, and attend our live events. But our ambitions are still growing. Our aim is nothing less than to be a standard-bearer for truth in an age of disinformation.\"\n\nAmazon's big error\n\nKerry Flynn writes: Amazon accidentally broke the embargo on Margaret Atwood's new book \"The Testament,\" a sequel to \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" The online-book-seller-turned-tech-behemoth shipped the book to Amazon customers who preordered it this week even though the release date is September 10.\n\nSpeaking of \"The Testaments...\"\n\nShe points out that, from a political point of view, \"the desired outcome of 'The Handmaid's Tale' would have been that it would fade into obscurity as a period piece, so that my dire warnings would not prove to be correct.
