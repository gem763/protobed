The redesigned potato chip bag and new logo give Lay's its first new look in 12 years.\n\nUnlike previous redesigns, Lay's isn't undergoing a radical transformation. Instead, the refreshed logo and packaging are meant to make the brand feel more modern and contemporary, said Jon Guerra, senior director of design at Frito-Lay.\n\nLay's new potato chip bags\n\nThe new logo is smaller and centralized with radiating rings. The font is slightly different, with a cursive \"y\" and a somewhat smaller \"L.\"\n\nThe biggest change to Lay's potato chip bags is the photography: The view of the chips is now shown from a \"top-down\" angle -- an homage to the rise of food photographers on social media, said Guerra.\n\nThe redesign, which took two years to complete, is an attempt to keep the brand relevant in the era of social media and content regeneration, according to Guerra.\n\nRead More", "description": "Lay's is launching a potato chip bag redesign and a new logo for the first time in twelve years in order to remain relevant in the era of social media and content generation.", "authors": ["Millie Dent", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190918133910-02-lays-2019-brand-redesign-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
