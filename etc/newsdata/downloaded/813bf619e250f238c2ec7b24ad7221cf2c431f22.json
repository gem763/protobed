China's top trade envoy, Liu He, will lead a delegation to resume trade talks with U.S. officials in Washington on Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged the U.S. to withdraw its move against the Chinese firms, and said, \"China will continue to take firm and strong measures to uphold its national sovereignty, our security and development interests.\"\n\nIn the U.S., futures on the S&P 500 fell 0.7%.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 was down 1% in midday trade, its banking sector down 2%. The German DAX fell 1.1%.\n\nShares in London Stock Exchange Group fell 4.8% after Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing pulled a $36.6 billion bid for its London rival, a deal that would have united two major trading hubs.\n\nMeanwhile, German industrial output grew slightly in August, according to official data. The rise was a surprise after a dismal reading on Monday of manufacturing orders for the same month.\n\nIndustrial output increased 0.3% in August over July in adjusted terms, the statistical office said. Despite the better-than-expected output, the industry remains in a downturn, the Ministry of Economics said.\n\nThe British pound also stumbled on political headwinds Tuesday, falling 0.8% against the euro and down 0.6% against the U.S. dollar, amid increased skepticism a Brexit deal could be reached at the EU Council of State next week, said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG Group.\n\nThough a possible Brexit extension past Oct. 31 would ordinarily be seen as a positive for the pound, the expectation that an impasse over a deal with the EU would trigger an election has sparked concerns that a new U.K. government could move ahead with a divorce from the EU without an agreement in place, he said.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year German bund edged down to minus 0.591%, from minus 0.572% Monday afternoon. The yield on 10-year Treasurys also edged down to 1.520%, from 1.552% on Monday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nOn the trade front, China's recent large purchases from the U.S. soybean market have signaled a potential thaw in relations. But China has also sought to narrow the scope of the trade negotiations, putting aside national-security issues and adding to market concerns that an immediate resolution is unlikely.\n\n\"They will not reach an agreement at any price,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at London Capital Group. \"Despite the optimism we see, there's a chance this week ends with another disappointment.\"\n\nGlobal oil benchmark Brent crude fell 0.7% to $57.91 a barrel, and gold gained 0.2%.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 1% and Korea's Kospi gained 1.2%. Stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong rose 0.3% as Chinese markets returned from a holiday.\n\nSamsung Electronics' shares rose 2.4% after the company delivered a strong third-quarter earnings forecast.\n\nEva Dou contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 07:44 ET (11:44 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
