He seemed to acknowledge the odd timing of this latest video, given the recent announcement of his new book, How to Beat Trump, and how it further shocked and dismayed his accusers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a little bit in the public eye and I know the announcement of the book was really troubling and painful for the women that I victimized,\u201d he confessed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so sorry for that. I really know that one of my highest obligations for the rest of my life is to not do anything to cause them more pain. And I hope, even with the release of the book going forward, that I can do everything possible to minimize anything that I might do that might make them more uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nHalperin once again attempted to distance himself from his past misbehavior, emphasizing that all of the alleged incidents occurred over a decade ago, during his time at ABC News, and that he has since worked to improve his perspective by speaking with religious leaders, therapists, and victims of sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cIn the ten years after I left ABC, while I was still working as a journalist, I did change my behavior, I was a better colleague, I was someone who understood the proper way to behave in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nHalperin added: \u201cI can\u2019t just say I\u2019m going to move on. I have to address it every day in every way I can.\u201d\n\nThe 17-minute sitdown\u2014which represented Halperin\u2019s most in-depth discussion thus far on the subject that ended his career\u2014was just the latest attempt at a redemption and apology tour in the lead-up to his new book.\n\nSince coming out of hiding early this year, he\u2019s repeatedly issued apologies in articles covering his return to the spotlight and during multiple appearances on CNN host Michael Smerconish\u2019s SiriusXM radio show.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s interview, Halperin also repeated a claim that has tried to reach out and apologize to many of his victims through intermediaries\u2014but many still refuse to hear him out.\n\nBut for some of Halperin\u2019s accusers, the new video only sparked more outrage.\n\nFormer reporter Emily Miller, who accused Halperin of sexual assault, told The Daily Beast she does not accept his latest attempt at an apology: \u201cHe's always denied everything I\u2019ve said he did to me so how can he apologize?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has told multiple people I\u2019m lying,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never tried in any way to contact me to apologize. If he wants to apologize, name names and say he\u2019s sorry to us.\"\n\n\u201cAs Mark says in the interview, he has made offers directly and through intermediaries in the past to apologize to and meet with the women he victimized,\u201d a source close to Halperin told The Daily Beast. \u201cAs he also said, he reiterates that offer publicly now. If any of the women, including Emily Miller, are willing to hear from him, he is eager to make that happen.\u201d\n\nMiller also called it \u201csick\u201d for Willoughby to have conducted the interview with Halperin. The domestic-abuse survivor has, in recent months, publicly explored the idea of whether men accused of misconduct could have a role in public life again. In a Washington Post op-ed earlier this year, she pondered whether her ex-husband should be allowed to return to the public eye, asking \u201cIs there a place for a person in public service after being involved in scandal and abuse?\u201d\n\nIn an email to The Daily Beast, Willoughby said Halperin reached out to her in March after she wrote about Porter\u2019s attempt at redemption, saying the political pundit \u201csought counsel on what more he needed to learn from his experience and suggestions on how he might be able to make amends.\u201d She said she suggested participating in an interview where viewers could \u201cfeel his remorse and contrition the way I did,\u201d and Halperin ultimately agreed and asked her to conduct it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don't think the format was able to demonstrate his sincerity in the same unrehearsed and authentic way I have had the opportunity to experience him one-on-one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut having spoken with him several times on each of the topics addressed in the interview, I do find his answers genuine.\u201d\n\nTrial attorney and victims\u2019 rights advocate Ari Wilkenfeld, who recently met with Halperin on behalf of several accusers, said he was not pleased with what the interview video, which he described as a \u201cvideo presentation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that was troubling about his video presentation was his use of quote three A\u2019s (apologize with specificity, affirm and acknowledge the harm, advocate),\u201d he said. \u201cI was troubled that he co-opted the three A\u2019s and in the same video presentation demonstrated that he doesn\u2019t understand them or is unable to do the hard work. The most important example of that is there\u2019s a reason #1 is to apologize with specificity.\u201d\n\nAnother Halperin accuser, who has previously spoken on-record but requested to speak anonymously here, reacted to Tuesday\u2019s video, by asking: \u201cWhy is this coming back? It seems like we were really moving forward in a positive direction and then all of a sudden this book is [coming] out and he\u2019s trending on Twitter and I\u2019m like \u2018This guy, he\u2019s back again.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther Halperin accusers, meanwhile, expressed cautious optimism about the new video.\n\n\u201cWhile I haven\u2019t communicated with Mark, I was encouraged to see him begin to make an effort to start acknowledging his actions and their consequences,\u201d Eleanor McManus, co-founder of Trident DMG, who previously came forward with her own story about Halperin, told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut he\u2019s had two years to do this. I sincerely hope this isn\u2019t a cynical attempt to repair his reputation on the eve of his book release. Only time and his actions will tell.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Halperin has repeatedly attempted to jumpstart his punditry career, but has been met with limited success.\n\nHe called top editors at publications including The Hill, clashed behind-the-scenes with MSNBC chief Phil Griffin, and saw an effort to collaborate with some of his fellow former Morning Joe colleagues derailed.\n\nIndeed, in Tuesday\u2019s interview, Halperin seemed to concede that he may never truly work in the business again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll be a journalist or not,\u201d he lamented. \u201cTo be a journalist you have to demonstrate integrity, people have to trust you. I know that because of what I did at ABC, I squandered that. And in the eyes of some people, I should never be a journalist again.\u201d", "description": "The former pundit tried to publicly apologize again, this time in an uncomfortable chat with Jennie Willoughby, who accused her ex-husband, a former Trump aide, of domestic abuse.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Lachlan Cartwright", "Media Reporter", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_671,w_1194,x_45,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571764195/halperin-jennie_auucaz", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
