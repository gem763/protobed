They got a response from one of Pompeo's closest senior officials, Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, saying the message had been received and would be considered.\n\nYet Pompeo did nothing and less than two months later, Yovanovitch was recalled from her post at the behest of Trump....\n\nMounting criticism about his handling of the matter has left the Secretary of State feeling victimized, according to those familiar with his thinking.", "description": "It's not easy being a powerless secretary of state.", "authors": ["Daniel W.
