Under current law, the program\u2019s trust funds would be exhausted by 2035 and Congress would have to add more money to keep existing benefits.\n\nDemocrats on the House Ways and Means Committee met for several hours Monday night and again Tuesday to discuss the proposal from Rep. John Larson (D., Conn.). But with Republicans controlling the Senate and the White House, Mr. Larson\u2019s measure is exceedingly unlikely to become law in this Congress.\n\nHis Social Security 2100 Act would increase benefits across the board and boost the minimum benefit. It would also lower income taxes on Social Security benefits. Under current law, individuals with income of at least $25,000 and married couples with incomes of $32,000 must pay income taxes on a portion of their benefits. The bill would raise those thresholds to $50,000 and $100,000.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What steps should Congress take to address the long-term future of Social Security? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe most controversial piece would be the proposed payroll-tax increases, which total more than $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Currently, employers and employees each pay 6.2% of wages up to $132,900, and that wage cap increases each year. Mr. Larson\u2019s bill would immediately begin imposing the tax on wages above $400,000, mirroring ideas Democrats have considered for years. But he goes further, proposing to increase the tax rate from 6.2% to 7.4% over 25 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nCurrently, someone making $50,000 faces an employee-side Social Security payroll tax of $3,100 a year. Under the bill, that tax bill would rise to $3,125 in 2020, which Mr. Larson pitches as an extra 50 cents a week. The tax would continue rising until 2043, when it would hit $3,700. Employers would face the same tax increase. Economists generally think workers bear the cost of both sides of the tax.\n\nMr. Larson argues for the bill as a way to counteract gender and racial wage gaps and make up for the decline of defined-benefit pensions and labor unions.\n\n\u201cThis is going to become the newest civil-rights issue,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Democratic presidential candidates support expanding Social Security, but the issue hasn\u2019t been particularly prominent in the campaign, taking a back seat to proposals to dramatically expand Medicare.\n\nRepublicans have signaled their opposition to the bill during a July hearing and again this week.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats were truly interested in strengthening Social Security, we would be doing this on a bipartisan basis,\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on Ways and Means, said Tuesday. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 plan raises taxes on low-income, hardworking Americans while giving more benefits to millionaires.\u201d\n\nConventional wisdom in Washington has long been that Social Security changes have to be bipartisan, because of the political risks for Democrats in raising taxes and for Republicans in cutting future benefits. But House Democrats are now thinking about moving ahead by themselves, risking political blowback.\n\n\u201cIf your goal is not to do anything, which is their goal, then how are they ever going to work with us?\u201d Mr. Larson said of Republicans.\n\nRep. Don Beyer (D., Va.) said he expected the Ways and Means panel to vote before Thanksgiving. And Mr. Larson said he thought the committee would move this month. Mr. Larson\u2019s bill already has 210 co-sponsors from the progressive and moderate wings of the party, putting him close to having a majority of the House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough one, but it\u2019s one we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Rep. Dan Kildee (D., Mich.)\n\nRep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), the Ways and Means Committee chairman, held the July hearing. He is a co-sponsor of the bill, along with enough other Ways and Means Democrats to make a majority.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Mr. Neal wouldn\u2019t say directly whether the committee would vote. Asked whether he liked the bill as it is, Mr. Neal said: \u201cWhat John Larson has done is helpful to public debate.\u201d\n\nMany left-leaning organizations back Mr. Larson. Still, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive group, has argued against Mr. Larson\u2019s proposed cuts to income taxes on Social Security benefits, because it would tend to give more help to higher-income households.\n\nRep. Ron Kind (D., Wis.), a Ways and Means member who hasn\u2019t co-sponsored the bill, said lawmakers need more time to discuss the issue with newer members of Congress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all known that the sooner you can address the reforms that are needed, the less painful it becomes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer you wait, the more draconian it becomes.\u201d\n\nMr. Kind said he has asked Mr. Larson to consider approaches other than a payroll-tax increase that hits lower-income workers.\n\n\u201cI would not be surprised if we try to move forward in committee,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s clearly more work that needs to be done.\u201d\n\nWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "description": "House Democrats are debating whether to advance a significant expansion of Social Security that would extend the program\u2019s solvency and increase benefits by raising taxes on top earners and middle-income workers.", "authors": ["Richard Rubin", "Richard.Rubin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106059/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
