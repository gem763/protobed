The two leaders were expected to finalize the agreement at the Nov. 16-17 meeting, which usually brings together more than 20 world leaders.\n\nA person familiar with the talks said the cancellation made the situation \u201cawkward\u201d but doesn\u2019t affect the progress being made.\n\n\"What it means is that we have to figure out a different venue,\u201d this person said. \u201cWe just have to figure out someplace where it can be done where it's suitable.\u201c\n\nOfficials from both the U.S. and China were working in recent weeks to finalize the text of the agreement, in which the U.S. will put a pause on tariff escalation and China will agree to major agricultural purchases. A Chinese government spokesperson said on Tuesday that both sides \u201caffirmed that technical consultations on part of the text has been basically completed.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Trump was optimistic that a deal would be reached by mid-November, saying negotiations were progressing well.\n\n\u201cWe are looking probably to be ahead of schedule to sign a very big portion of the China deal, and we\u2019ll call it phase one but it\u2019s a very big portion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat would take care of the farmers. It would take care of some of the other things. It will also take care of a lot of the banking needs.\u201d\n\nThe White House and U.S. Trade Representative's office didn't immediately respond to a question on what the cancellation might mean for the U.S.-China agreement.\n\nThe decision announced Wednesday by Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era also cancels the United Nations climate change conference, the COP25, due to take place in Santiago Dec. 2-13.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply sorry and sorry for the problems and inconveniences that this decision will mean for both APEC and the COP. But as President of all Chileans, I must always put the problems, the interests of Chileans, their needs, their desires and their wishes first in line,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said in comments.\n\nChile and its capital Santiago have experienced major unrest after a subway fare hike sparked broader protests against income inequality at a scale not seen in decades.\n\nDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.", "description": "Chile has canceled the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit of world leaders next month in Santiago after a wave of deadly protests in recent weeks.
