Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joined in September.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Australia are the principal Western partners of the US to have agreed to send warships to escort commercial shipping in the Gulf.\n\nMost European states have declined to participate, fearful of undermining their efforts to save the nuclear accord with Iran, which was weakened by the US withdrawal.\n\nIran, which considers itself the guardian of the Gulf, has presented its own regional plan to assure \"energy security\" and \"freedom of navigation\".", "description": "Representatives from more than 60 countries including Israel but not Iran met in Bahrain on Monday to discuss maritime security following attacks on tankers in the Gulf and Saudi oil installations.
