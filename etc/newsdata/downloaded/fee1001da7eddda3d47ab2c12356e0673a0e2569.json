Standing alongside the President of El Salvador discussing border security, he called the Ukraine-call controversy \u201ca hoax\u201d and said Pelosi had been taken over \u201cby the radical left.\u201d Announcing the U.S.-Japan trade deal, he joked that maybe Pelosi wouldn\u2019t have time to sign the deal: \u201cShe\u2019s wasting her time on a\u2014you know, let\u2019s use a word they say a lot: a \u2018manufactured crisis.\u2019\u201d Speaking with members of the U.S. mission to the UN, he mused that whoever provided information to the whistle-blower was \u201calmost a spy.\u201d\n\nThen he went home. The General Assembly carried on.\n\nNon-U.S. delegates I spoke with were following news of the impeachment saga, but were busy with their own meetings and trying not to comment on U.S. politics. The U.S. mission to the UN did not respond to a query about what effect, if any, the impeachment story was having on their own goals for the General Assembly. But as one UN official told me: \u201cThe biggest crisis is where you\u2019re sitting. If you\u2019re in Aden, it\u2019s Yemen. If you\u2019re in the Central African Republic,\u201d it\u2019s the ongoing violence in the country despite a February peace deal. (The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid assessment.) CNN played on a television in the background, with a triple-split screen of reporters discussing the impeachment and the whistle-blower.\n\nFor many countries, the official said, the General Assembly is \u201ctheir country\u2019s, their crises\u2019 moment in the sun.\u201d\n\nTo some degree, the General Assembly and the confabs around it are structured to absorb the outsize attention any U.S. president naturally attracts there, as the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful country, which also happens to host the UN\u2019s headquarters. For the past several years, the secretary-general has spent days ahead of the annual gathering pushing his priority issues before the U.S. president even shows up\u2014this year it was climate, and Thunberg\u2019s much-covered carbon-neutral boat commute, capped off by her rebuke to the world (\u201cHow dare you!\u201d and \u201cYou are failing us\u201d), ensured it stayed on the news agenda in the lead-up to the meetings.\n\nRead: Why Greta makes adults uncomfortable\n\nAnd there was plenty of actual policy drama to go around.
