EM ASIA FX-Most Asian currencies slip ahead of trade talks; Taiwan dollar gains\n\n* Media report on US-China talks press offshore yuan\n\n* Top-level talks open in Washington on Thursday\n\n* Taiwan dollar rises ahead of September trade data\n\n\n\n(Adds text, updates prices)\n\nBy Shreya Mariam Job\n\nOct 7 (Reuters) - Most Asian currencies edged lower on\n\nMonday after risk appetites were dented by a media report saying\n\nChina wants the scope of this week's trade talks and any deal\n\nwith the United States to be kept narrow.\n\nMarket sentiment was dampened by a Bloomberg report stating\n\nChinese officials are signalling increasing reluctance to agree\n\nto a broad trade deal pursued by President Donald Trump.\n\nTop-level trade talks between the United States and China\n\nare scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"Risk of breakdown in trade talks will re-ignite fears and\n\npose further upward pressure on USD-AXJs (Asia ex Japan),\" a\n\nMaybank note said.\n\nThe report pulled the offshore yuan the currency most\n\nexposed to trade tensions, 0.3% lower against the dollar.\n\nOnshore trading in the yuan was closed due to a holiday in\n\nChina.\n\nAmong Southeast Asian currencies, the Philippine peso\n\ndeclined the most, weakening 0.3%.\n\nThe Singapore dollar slipped 0.1% on weakness in the\n\noffshore yuan, while the Malaysian ringgit skidded 0.1%.\n\nThe Indonesian rupiah IDR=ID dropped 0.2%. Data showed\n\nthat the country's foreign reserves dropped by $2.1 billion to\n\n$124.3 billion in September, partly due to payments of offshore\n\npublic debt. TAIWAN DOLLAR\n\nBucking Monday's trend, the Taiwan dollar TWD=TP firmed as\n\nmuch as 0.3% ahead of release of the island's September trade\n\ndata due at 0800 GMT Monday.\n\n\"We think TWD is likely to be more resilient compared to KRW\n\nand CNH, as it benefits from trade diversion and potential\n\ncapital repatriation flows,\" a Barclays note said.\n\nMany companies have been moving their manufacturing\n\nfacilities to the island amid rising tariffs imposed on Chinese\n\ngoods by the United States.\n\nTaiwan's exports are likely to have grown 1% in September\n\nfrom a year earlier, logging a second month of growth, according\n\nto a Reuters poll.
