Ultimately, the country must be freed from all \u201cillegal foreign military presence,\u201d the president added, reiterating Moscow's long-time position.\n\nThe almost-seven-hour-long talks in Sochi, Russia between Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan were focused on the situation in Syria, particularly the ongoing offensive in its northeastern region.\n\nRead more\n\nKurdish forces to withdraw\n\nThe agreement says the Kurdish-led militias \u2013 the prime target of the Turkish operation \u2013 must withdraw into Syrian territory beyond 30km from the Turkish border. Erdogan's operation, meanwhile, will continue in a limited area \u2013 between towns of Tell Abyad and Ras al-Ayn \u2013 up to 32km inside Syrian territory.\n\nSyrian army to be deployed to the border\n\nOther parts of the Syrian border \u2013 from Kobani to Tell Abyad and from Ras al-Ayn to the Iraqi border \u2013 are set to be controlled by the Syrian military and border guards, supported by Russian military police.\n\nJoint Russia-Turkey patrols along the border\n\nAt the same time, areas not affected by the Turkish military operation, will be jointly patrolled by the Turkish military and Russian military police up to 10km deep into Syrian territory.\n\nCaptive ISIS militants must be contained\n\nThe issue of multiple prisons and camps in northeastern Syria where Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) fighters are detained, was specifically singled out. Putin stressed that the inevitable chaos created by the Turkish operation should not allow them to escape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that members of terrorist organizations, including ISIS, whose militants are held captive by Kurdish armed groups and are trying to break free, do not take advantage of the Turkish armed forces actions,\u201d Putin stressed.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, for his part, urged those who had created and maintained the prisons to understand their \u201cresponsibility\u201d in preventing IS detainees' escape.\n\nRevitalizing 1998 Adana Accord\n\nBoth Turkey and Russia reiterated the importance of the 1998 Adana accord, a security pact between Syria and Turkey. Among other things it allows the Turkish military to carry out cross-border operations in Syria, while Damascus promised not to harbor members of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which Ankara considers a terrorist organization. While diplomatic relations between the two were significantly damaged during the years of the Syrian conflict, the pact was never denounced, and now Moscow has pledged to support its implementation in the \u201cmodern reality.\u201d\n\nThe PKK has been waging a low-intensity insurgency in Turkey for decades, ultimately seeking the creation of an independent Kurdish state. Ankara has accused the Kurdish-led militias across the border in Syria of having strong ties to the PKK. Indeed, PKK flags and insignia have been repeatedly seen displayed by Kurdish forces in Syria, though the extent of the ties between the groups is not known.\n\nUS stance on Syria too \u2018fluid & contradictory\u2019 to listen to\n\nThe Turkish-Russian memorandum mostly covers the same region and the same issue as the deal reached between Ankara and Washington five days ago. Still, the US and its \u201cceasefire\u201d were barely mentioned by the top officials after Tuesday's Sochi talks.The reason behind that was summed up by Russia\u2019s foreign minister.\n\n\u201dWe do not particularly look at the United States and its stance. That stance is quite variable and contradictory, and of course, the coalition led by the United States is in Syria illegally, this is well known,\u201d Lavrov told reporters.\n\nDamascus is on board\n\nAfter the meeting with Erdogan, Russia\u2019s president spoke to his Syrian counterpart Bashar Assad, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Assad has expressed support for the memorandum, stating that the Syrian border guards are ready to work together with Russian military police.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018America is running away\u2019: Irate Kurds pelt withdrawing US forces with vegetables (VIDEO)\n\nOn October 9, the region was invaded by the Turkish military and affiliated militants from the so-called Syrian \u201copposition.\u201d The operation targeted Kurdish-led militias, which Ankara considers to be \u201cterrorists.\u201d The assault, dubbed \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019, kicked off just two days after US President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of his country\u2019s troops from the northeast of Syria.\n\nLast week, the US and Turkey agreed a five-day ceasefire in the region, which expires at 10pm local time (19:00 GMT) on Tuesday. The pause in the operation was intended to allow the Kurdish-led militias to withdraw, facilitating the creation of a 20-mile \u201csafe zone\u201d within Syria that Turkey has sought to establish. Earlier in the day, Erdogan said he was ready to resume the operation if the US fails to keep its promises.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly urged Turkey to show restraint in its activities in Syria, and warned it against doing anything that might hamper the political settlement process in the country.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
