Beginning in 2020, the nation\u2019s biggest private employer will run pilots in select markets along with its existing medical plan, to see if they can scale across the entire company. Walmart hosts more than 1 million associates and family members on its medical plans.\n\nThe idea is to test whether these new programs \u2014 called Featured Providers, Expanded Telehealth, Personal Healthcare Assistant, National Quality Provider Resource, and Nationwide Fitness Club Access \u2014 can help prevent users from running up unnecessary or avoidable costs, according to Walmart.\n\nDriving Walmart\u2019s effort is what the company says are approximately one-third of medical costs in the U.S. that are racked up by unneeded treatment. The initiative comes as employer-sponsored insurance costs have skyrocketed around the country.\n\n\"Our healthcare system is just too complex,\" Adam Stavisky, senior vice president of U.S. benefits at Walmart, said. \"The system is opaque. It's expensive. Candidly, it can be intimidating for many people.\"\n\nCalling the rising cost curve \u201cthe north star\u201d for Walmart, Stavisky noted that \u201cThirty percent of all care in America is unnecessary.\"\n\nThe Centers of Excellence example\n\nCustomers shop in the pharmacy section of a Sam's Club store, a division of Wal-Mart Stores in Bentonville, Arkansas June 4, 2009.

REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi (UNITED STATES BUSINESS HEALTH) More\n\nWalmart\u2019s Centers of Excellence, a program that first debut in 2013, gave the company insight into how and why health care dollars are spent. The program allows for employees enrolled in the company's medical plan to access specialized care at top hospitals. Options include certain cancer treatments, hip and joint replacements, and spinal surgery, among others.\n\nFor example, if a local doctor tells a Walmart employee enrolled in the company's plan that he or she needs spinal surgery, they can go to one of the Centers of Excellence hospitals. The visit is covered under the company's plan, and Walmart also pays for the travel, lodging, and food for the patient and a caregiver.\n\nThe experience taught Walmart that in some cases, patients were being referred for unnecessary treatment. According to the retail giant, more than half of the Walmart employees (or their relatives) who traveled to one of the Centers of Excellence for spine surgery at the recommendation of their local physician discovered that they did not need the procedure. Meanwhile, 20 percent of the patients sent for joint-related issues also didn\u2019t need the procedure.\n\n\"Once they were given a different treatment plan, they avoided unnecessary surgery and recovered more quickly. In addition to better medical outcomes, their medical costs were greatly reduced,\" the company said.\n\nWith that in mind, Walmart associates in Orlando and Tampa, Dallas-Fort Worth \u2014 and the retailer's home-base of Northwest Arkansas \u2014 will have access to a program called Featured Provider starting next year. To do this, Walmart tapped Embold Health, a startup founded by the retailer's former chief medical officer Daniel Stein.", "description": "Walmart learned first hand that unnecessary medical care is driving costs higher.", "authors": ["Julia La Roche"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MBtRUmX6261ToXuGQQ0Www--~B/aD0yNjM0O3c9NDY4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5b2a5470-ded2-11e9-b6fe-ac5b3a3afa34", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
