Shock. Outrage.\n\n\u201cTrump to snub climate summit for religious freedom meeting at U.N.,\u201d is how one headline from The Guardian put it.\n\nBut you go Trump.\n\nThis is what matters \u2014 not weather changes.\n\nEighty percent of the world lives under some form of religious persecution or oppression, said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Center, on Fox & Friends.\n\nAmerica\u2019s lucky; we have God-given rights to worship as we see fit, as enshrined in the First Amendment.\n\nBut other nations don\u2019t see it that way.\n\nAccording to 2019 statistics from Open Doors USA, the level of persecution those of faith have experienced around the world rose from 215 million to 245 million \u2014 by 14% \u2014 in the last year. One of nine Christians \u201cexperience high levels of persecution worldwide,\u201d the organization wrote. And among those persecuted, 4,136 Christians were killed simply because of their belief in Jesus \u2014 that\u2019s 11 killed every day \u2014 and 1,266 churches or Christian buildings were attacked.\n\nPastor Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Church said this, on Fox & Friends: \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable thing this president would skip a U.N. climate change summit, an imaginary problem, to address a real one,\u201d religious persecution.\n\nRemarkable and bold.\n\nThis is why Trump won, and continues to win, with the media-dubbed evangelicals, by the way. \u2018Cause he doesn\u2019t worship trees.\n\nSo let the U.N. pinheads have their climate alarmism. Let the media fawners who do the pinheads\u2019 bidding have their climate hysteria.\n\nThis administration has made clear it\u2019s not following the path of false worship \u2014 it\u2019s not going to treat environmentalism as religion.\n\nTrump\u2019s priorities at the United Nations couldn\u2019t be more on point.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
