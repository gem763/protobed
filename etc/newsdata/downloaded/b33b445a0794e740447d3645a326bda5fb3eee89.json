They spent 30 minutes freeing the animal.\n\nFootage shows how several members of the rig fought against the wave and the strength of the whale shark to pull it near so they could cut it loose.\n\nAfter freeing the animal, video footage shows it waving a fin at the workers.\n\nWorawith said he was relieved to have saved the whale shark from further suffering.\n\nHe said: 'The hardest part of this mission was pulling the whale shark close as it was so strong. We steadied him then cut him loose.\n\n'The waves were also so strong, which made it twice as hard to but we were able to do it and could free him eventually.\n\nWorawith said he was relieved to have saved the whale shark from further suffering. 'The hardest part of this mission was pulling the whale shark close as it was so strong. We steadied him then cut him loose'\n\n'The whale sharks always swim by our platform, especially when the storm is coming. We notice them and know it's a sign the weather is about to change.\n\n'When I was told about the whale shark stuck in a rope, the first thought popped up in my head was to help him because the employees here were familiar with him.\n\n'Everybody including me was so happy that we could help release him but we have to admit that it was quite hard work.'\n\nAnother worker who was involved in the rescue, Pitak Jiaknguluem, said the whale shark could have been the same fish that was seen earlier in the day near the offshore rig before disappearing. It reappeared later with the rope around its trail, he said.", "description": "Drillers on a Chevron platform in the\u00a0Gulf of Thailand rushed to help when they discovered the 17-foot-long whale shark struggling after it became caught in fishing rope.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20274964-0-image-a-6_1572259117784.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
