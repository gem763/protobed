They are also quicker to build than traditional bricks and mortar homes with minimal on-site time and disturbance, and if properly maintained, the lifespan of a container is indefinite.\n\nThe only drawback is that you need to have cash in hand to build with containers, as local banks still don\u2019t offer home loans for this type of building method. You also have to get a building permit and adhere to building codes.\n\nThe modular nature of shipping containers means that you can design your home as if building with toy blocks \u2013 and dream up your dream space by \u2018stacking\u2019 the containers horizontally and/ or vertically and any way imaginable.\n\nAnd this home in Riebeek West, about 75km outside of Cape Town, is proof that the result can be quite beautiful. It uses a clever combination of steel beams, bricks and mortar, and 5 containers. The framework for the structure is steel with 5 containers that fit snugly inside \u2013 3 below and 2 on top. The bottom 3 containers rest on a concrete floor into which the steel columns were planted for the frame.\n\nThis home is featured in the September 2019 issue of Home magazine. This issue also features various homes constructed using alternative building methods: An awe-inspiring timber cabin outside Stanford; a light-steel frame house in Rosendal, a home made from recycled bricks outside Stellenbosch, as well as a previously dilapidated wine cellar in Robertson which has been transformed into modern accommodation.\n\nFor more, go to Home magazine on Instagram.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Repurposed shipping container homes are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative building method for South African homeowners.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9313/eaedc00f5b66461e924f0ceb9d0a35eb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
