His understanding is [that decision] came from on top.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the person said Reeker, who is responsible for policy toward more than 50 countries and travels internationally extensively, has an \u201cimperfect memory.\u201d The person familiar with Reeker\u2019s testimony said it is not clear how that decision was communicated to him.\n\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity so that they could discuss Reeker\u2019s testimony, which was delivered in a closed-door hearing to House committees investigating President Trump\u2019s actions involving Ukraine.\n\nReeker began testifying Saturday morning before the House Intelligence Committee, which is focusing on the decision to sideline professional diplomats like Yovanovitch, who was aggressively fighting corruption in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nPrevious witnesses have said the administration withheld $391 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine to pressure the new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden is running for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nAD\n\nReeker testified Saturday under subpoena after the State Department directed him not to cooperate.\n\nHis account offers a striking picture of the degree to which professional diplomats were frozen out of policymaking in some regions of the world and subordinated to decisions apparently made for political reasons.\n\nReeker was named acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs in mid-March. From his first day, he was confronted with rumors and conspiracy theories about Yovanovitch, which were spreading through conservative U.S. media. State Department officials considered them baseless and a \u201cclassic disinformation campaign.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nReeker\u2019s deputy, George P. Kent, whose portfolio countries include Ukraine, earlier told the committee he also was alarmed at the lies spreading about Yovanovitch.\n\nAD\n\nReeker also testified that though he was officially the top diplomat in charge of U.S. policy toward Europe, Ukrainian policy was being driven by Kurt Volker, the special envoy for the country who reported directly to Pompeo, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a close Trump ally.\n\n\u201cIn that universe, he wasn\u2019t taking the lead,\u201d the person said of Reeker.\n\nReeker also testified that he was aware of the involvement of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, in spreading baseless accusations about Yovanovitch, but he did not track Giuliani\u2019s actions in Ukraine beyond that.\n\nAD\n\nReeker said he was more focused on trying to shield Yovanovitch, a longtime personal friend and colleague.\n\nMany diplomats have become disillusioned with Pompeo\u2019s leadership. Mike McKinley, a senior adviser to Pompeo, resigned earlier this month in part because he was distressed by the State Department\u2019s failure to stand up for Yovanovitch.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Reeker was aware of the hold on U.S. security aid to Ukraine, he did not know the reasons behind it, according to the person familiar with his testimony. He was not involved in any conversations about efforts to pressure Zelensky, the person said.\n\nAfter initially deflecting questions about what he knew, Pompeo has acknowledged being on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky. But he has steadfastly refused to discuss internal conversations, and he grew testy when local reporters questioned him about the scandal during interviews in Tennessee and Kansas.\n\nAD\n\nLike other diplomats who have testified, Reeker is a career Foreign Service officer with a reputation for being apolitical, hard-working and professional. Colleagues say he is the type of leader whom junior Foreign Service officers turn to for career guidance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a workhorse, not a showboat,\u201d said Daniel Fried, a former diplomat who resigned at the onset of the Trump administration. \u201cHe comes from the Masha Yovanovitch school of professionalism. He\u2019s a capable, nice, relaxed guy, not at all stiff. And he\u2019s utterly nonpartisan.\u201d\n\nReeker joined the State Department in 1992. He signed up for the Foreign Service exam \u201con a lark\u201d when he saw a flier for the test while attending the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University after graduating from Yale University.\n\nAD\n\nHe has done tours in Hungary and Macedonia, and he was the U.S. consul general in Milan. He won wide praise for his public diplomacy, serving as the deputy to spokesman Richard Boucher under secretaries of state Madeleine Albright, in the Clinton administration, and Colin Powell, under President George W. Bush. His work has been recognized with the Edward R. Murrow Award for Excellence in Public Diplomacy and with several State Department awards.\n\nAD\n\nBoucher said Reeker was unflappable, even when Reeker was the sole person in town who could speak for the department when a crisis broke out somewhere in the world.\n\n\u201cHe made the transition from a Democratic administration to a Republican one without any difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s fundamentally nonpartisan.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBoucher said it was in keeping with his independence that Reeker would jump to alert the top officials on the seventh floor of the Truman Building that lies were being spread about Yovanovitch.\n\n\u201cMasha is someone we all know, and we all think she is one of the best managers of people and policy we have in the State Department,\u201d he said, using Yovanovitch\u2019s nickname. \u201cTo hear her talked about in any other terms, the right thing to do is to stand up and say it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nThe State Department ethos, particularly among officials tasked with explaining policy in public, is to stand up and speak the truth inside the building, instead of taking it public where it can become politicized. Reeker epitomized that ethos, according to friends and colleagues.\n\nBut as a career diplomat whose position was preceded by the adjective \u201cacting,\u201d Reeker may not have as much clout as the political appointee who preceded him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a good job,\u201d Fried said. \u201cBut in this administration, if you\u2019re not political, you don\u2019t have a lot of juice. Now, all of the Ukraine team is under the knife.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Philip Reeker, head of the State Department bureau responsible for Europe, testified before a House impeachment panel on Saturday.", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gGlAj_q6zKAk2sHBVcRTLp3UvTE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KROG3XHXNUI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
