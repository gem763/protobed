We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke\n\nThat line above came from former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke as he answered a question at Thursday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Houston. The moderator asked about his proposal for a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons.\n\nO\u2019Rourke started calling for the mandatory buybacks, along with other measures, after the Aug. 3 mass shooting in El Paso, his hometown \u2014 which was then followed later in the month by a shooting in the Texas cities of Odessa and Midland.\n\nThe ex-congressman said a high-velocity round from an assault weapon shreds \u201ceverything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that,\u201d so that those hit on a battlefield wouldn\u2019t be able to get up and kill American troops. He then drew a contrast with when children are the targets, saying he met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15 in Odessa. That mother watched her daughter \u201cbleed to death over the course of an hour\u201d because so many other people were shot, and there weren\u2019t enough ambulances, he said.\n\nO\u2019Rourke also said he went to a gun show after making his proposal on buybacks, and there was some common ground on the issue. Everyone in the U.S. should be brought into the conversation on the matter, including Republicans and gun owners, he said.\n\nBut the NRA didn\u2019t seem to see common ground, as the gun-rights group quickly tweeted this response to O\u2019Rourke:", "description": "Former Texas Rep.
