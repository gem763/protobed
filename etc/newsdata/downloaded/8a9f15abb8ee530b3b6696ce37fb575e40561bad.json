It was established by UN agencies in Iraq in cooperation with the Iraqi government to promote and protect the rights of all Iraq's people according to international standards.", "description": "Death toll in five days of violent protests in Iraqi capital Baghdad and other Iraqi provinces climbed to 99 with nearly 4,000 people wounded, a member of the Iraqi human rights body said on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/06/5d991bbfa310cf3e979fda34.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
