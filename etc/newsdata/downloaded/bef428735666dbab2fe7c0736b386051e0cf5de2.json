It also means that my kids have a higher chance, a higher risk \u2013 even my grandkids have a higher risk.\n\n(Image: REUTERS/Fred Prouser)\n\n\"And they handled it like they should. They went and got the test.\u201d\n\nHe first went to the doctor when he spotted dots of blood on his shirts and was given the devastating diagnosis.\n\nMatthew has the BRCA2 gene mutation, which means he had a much higher risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nHe had surgery at the end of July and now says he is \"doing very well\".\n\nAndrew Fowler was one of the hundreds of men diagnosed with breast cancer in Britain when he was told he had the disease in 2000.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe 64-year-old retired banker said: \"I just never knew it was possible. And when I talked to my friends and family they never knew either.\"\n\nAnd Andrew faced further hurdles in his fight to beat breast cancer as several health professionals also didn't realise men could be diagnosed.\n\nHe said: \"The first time I went to get [cancer drug] tamoxifen I went to a pharmacist. She said \u2018This isn\u2019t for you is it? You can\u2019t have it it hasn\u2019t been approved for men\u2019, which simply wasn\u2019t true.\n\n\"Luckily I knew the law but if I hadn\u2019t she wouldn\u2019t have given it to me.\"\n\nHe also had to adapt exercises given to patients because they were all tailored towards women.\n\n(Image: SAM PEARCE/ SUNDAY EXPRESS)\n\nAndrew said: \"I thought it was hilarious because all the literature was aimed at women. After the operation you have to do certain exercises, which are all designed for women, so I had to invent my own.\n\n\"It\u2019s funny being a man in a women\u2019s world because women have it tough in a man\u2019s world so often.\"\n\nThe former banker is one of nine brave breast cancer survivors who have taken part in an inspirational photoshoot to show how amazing life after the disease can be.\n\nHe said: \"The shoot was great, we all had such a laugh and it was wonderful sharing stories. You can\u2019t be maudlin or morbid, you have to be constructive.\u201d\n\nGina Dannatt world imploded when she was told she had as little as six months to live.\n\n(Image: SAM PEARCE/ SUNDAY EXPRESS)\n\nShe had already endured a double mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy but was told the disease had spread to her lungs.\n\nThat was 12 years ago.\n\nNow 61, Gina has outlived her doctor\u2019s expectations and simply chose to live her life to the fullest for as long as she can.\n\nThe grandmother from Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, said: \"I felt numb when they told me. My arms and my face just went numb and I couldn\u2019t get a. breath properly.\n\n\u201cThe end of the world happened to me in that minute. I was scared but I did go home and make my arrangements, I sorted my funeral and even picked a burial plot.\n\n\u201cThen one day I just felt I can\u2019t do this and give in to it. Throw everything away when I\u2019m still here.\n\n\u201cSome people say to me it is because I\u2019m so positive and, yes, I am a positive person but I\u2019m not sure that is correct because I have had dear friends who have been so positive who have not made it. I really don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m just lucky.\n\n\u201cI get survivors guilt where I\u2019m still here and they\u2019re not it makes me feel bad and I don\u2019t quite understand it all.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the life she has, and the wars her body has gone through, Gina bared all in an innovative campaign by the Pink Ribbon Foundation, where breast cancer survivors stripped off and were decorated by body painter and fine artist Filippo Ioco.\n\nThe pictures featured eight women, to represent the one in eight women in the UK who will suffer the disease at some point, and one man, symbolising the one percent that are male.\n\n(Image: SAM PEARCE/ SUNDAY EXPRESS)\n\nLaura Bailey is just 37 but has been fighting breast cancer for the last two years.\n\nShe was diagnosed in 2017 with stage three inflammatory breast cancer that had spread to 11 of her lymph nodes.\n\nShe had chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a mastectomy but sadly in 2018 was told it is now in her hip bones. She is now incurable.\n\nThe mother-of-three from Sutton, south London, said: \u201cFor me I have to keep that fact at the forefront.\n\n\"I can\u2019t get into the idea that a miracle might happen, for my mental health anyway. I don\u2019t want to be a fantasist.\n\n\u201cI could pretend and say I\u2019m going to get through this but I would rather be the best mum and wife and person I can be. They say I\u2019ve hopefully got about 10 years.\n\n(Image: SAM PEARCE/ SUNDAY EXPRESS)\n\n\u201cYou know when people say we are all going to die, you could get hit by a bus?\n\n\"The difference is you never know that bus is coming. When you\u2019re in my position the bus sounds like a nice option.\n\n\u201cThe fact I hug my three-year-old and think I won\u2019t see you finish school, I won\u2019t know your children. That\u2019s the hardest.\n\n\u201cIt can feel very hollow, so you just try and stuff as much love and life into it. I love my husband and children. That\u2019s my happy place.\u201d\n\nLaura has a heartbreaking reason for taking part in the photoshoot.\n\nShe said: \"I want a picture of my body out there that doesn\u2019t make me cry. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\n\"It was like reclaiming myself, being part of something bigger, something symbolic.\"\n\n(Image: SAM PEARCE/ SUNDAY EXPRESS)\n\nFran Haworth, 48, from Surrey, has been cancer free for the last nine years.\n\nShe had a double mastectomy and partial hysterectomy in 2010 after discovering she carried the mutated BRCA2 gene despite no family history.\n\nFran said: \u201cI never thought it would happen to me. If I can tell my story and help one other woman I can feel like I have done something.\u201d\n\nHelen Smith, 55, from Essex, was never diagnosed with breast cancer but inherited the mutated BRCA1 gene and took the same route as Angelina Jolie in choosing a preventative double mastectomy.\n\n(Image: SAM PEARCE/ SUNDAY EXPRESS)\n\nShe said: \u201cIt was a no brainer for me. As soon as I knew I had it I was a basket case.\n\n\"It felt like you were sitting on a ticking time bomb. Afterwards it was like I could come up for air.\u201d\n\nInstagrammer Kaz Foncette, from London, was just 31 when she was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer two years ago and was diagnosed again in January.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe were so young, starting our married lives, thinking about travelling or nights out.\n\n\"I had no idea it was possible at that age, I didn\u2019t even think to check. I thought it was important to raise awareness and be liberated by doing the shoot.\u201d\n\nSaxophinist Rosemary Quaye, 50, from Cheshire, had a mastectomy after being diagnosed with DCIS and stage one ductal carcinoma.\n\n(Image: SAM PEARCE/ SUNDAY EXPRESS)\n\nShe had an invitation to have a mammogram early at age 49, and nearly turned it down, before changing her mind at the last minute.\n\nRosemary said: \u201cThat scan saved my life. If you have a chance to be checked or suspect anything go for it. I had no lump, no itching, no pain, nothing. You never know.\u201d\n\nVickie McHugh, 35, from Sutton Coldfield, was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2017 having being misdiagnosed for almost a year with a cyst caused by breastfeeding.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for her persistence she might not be here today.\n\nShe said: \u201cEven a five minute check can save your life. If something doesn\u2019t feel right keep going back till you feels happy.\u201d\n\n(Image: SAM PEARCE/ SUNDAY EXPRESS)\n\n(Image: SAM PEARCE/ SUNDAY EXPRESS)\n\nDancer Samantha Vale, 36 from Chesham, had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with invasive breast cancer last year.\n\nHeartbreakingly more cancer was discovered in July but she was given the all-clear in January.\n\nShe chose not to reconstruct her breasts and wants to raise awareness.\n\nSamantha said: \u201cI want to show people you can be flat and still beautiful. It isn\u2019t an option that is often presented to you, but I want people to know it is there.\u201d\n\nThis photoshoot was sponsored by Valspar Paint to celebrate its partnership with the Pink Ribbon Foundation and the Sunday Express, where two exclusive new pink paints have been created to raise money for Breast Cancer charities throughout the UK.\n\nFor more information or to make a donation: www.pinkribbonfoundation.org.uk.", "description": "Andrew Fowler has battled the disease, like Beyonce's dad, Matthew, and has joined eight women in an inspirational photoshoot for Breast Cancer Awareness month", "authors": ["Jaymi Mccann", "Jane Lavender", "Image", "Sam Pearce", "Reuters Fred Prouser", "Itv", "Sunday Express"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536115.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MYP_CHP__4442JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
