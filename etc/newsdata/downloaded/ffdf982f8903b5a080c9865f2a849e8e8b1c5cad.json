The ailing industrial giant raised its full-year cash flow target. GE stock rose, moving toward a buy point.\n\nX\n\nGE Earnings\n\nEstimates: Analysts expected GE earnings per share to slide 14% to 12 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research.\n\nResults: GE earnings rose slightly to 15 cents a share, excluding many items. That's the first EPS year-over-year gain in seven quarters. Sales dipped 0.1% to $23.36 billion, slightly beating.\n\nOrganic orders fell 1%, with backlog up 14% to $386 billion. Revenue fell 14% in the power segment. Revenue rose 8% in aviation, 5% in health and 13% in renewable energy. Those segments will form the core of the \"new,\" post-restructuring GE.\n\nOutlook: General Electric reiterated its recent full-year EPS guidance of 55-65 cents, in line with Wall Street consensus for GE earnings of 60 cents a share. GE now sees industrial cash flow of flat to up $2 billion in 2019, after generating $650 million in Q3, up from a prior view of negative $1 billion to positive $1 billion.\n\nGE Stock: Shares surged 6.5% to 9.66 before the open of Wednesday's stock market trading. GE stock is consolidating with a buy point of 10.89, near a decade-long low. But most of the latest GE stock pattern is below the 200-day line, which is not a great sign.\n\nThe relative strength line, measuring a stock's performance against the S&P 500, is at a two-decade low. The RS line is the blue line in the chart provided. Honeywell (HON) and Dow Jones component United Technologies (UTX) were not yet active. Both GE and Honeywell are former Dow Jones stocks.\n\nGE Restructuring\n\nAhead of the GE earnings report, the flagship aviation unit was in focus amid the Boeing (BA) 737 Max crisis and after Honeywell (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) beat on strong aviation sales. In July, General Electric warned of $1.4 billion in potential costs if 737 Max groundings drag on.\n\nWall Street also was watching for improvement in GE's power and finance units, cash flow and leverage position, more than a year after former Danaher (DHR) CEO Larry Culp took the helm. Those are areas of special concern to investors as General Electric, which has gutted the once-trusty GE stock dividend, looks for a turnaround.\n\nUnder Culp, the industrial giant has made several moves to raise or conserve cash to pay down debt, including selling a majority stake in Baker Hughes (BKR). But GE stock has flattened out after a sharp rally at the start of 2019.\n\nCulp has called improving GE's financial position his No. 1 priority.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nGE Delivers Flight-Ready Version Of World's Biggest Engine To Boeing\n\nIs GE Stock A Buy?\n\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists\n\nIBD Stock Of The Day\n\nFind The Latest Stocks Hitting Buy Zones With MarketSmith", "description": "GE earnings rose in the third quarter as General Electric industrial businesses generated cash.
