This is a widely held view, even among many who support the president for his policy successes and the well-conceived initiatives that are still in the balance, especially trade and other negotiations with China, and the attempted revival of nuclear non-proliferation in respect of Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe entirely admirable Peggy Noonan (Wall Street Journal and Fox News) seems to me illustrative of the best type of these people. She is effectively nonpartisan, extremely knowledgeable, and always very fair, and she wishes every U.S. president well and hopes that whoever is in that position does a good job for the country. Because she worked so closely with President Reagan, she may tend to measure presidents against him, and few in history can live up to his quality, as a man and as a leader. But there is nothing wrong with having high standards. It is clear from some of her columns that she finds the president\u2019s bellicosity toward his opponents, and his tendency to be nasty and personal toward them, disappointing and unsuitable to a president.", "description": "", "authors": ["Conrad Black", "Nationalreview.Com Trumps-Only-Real-Weakness-Is-His-Style"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
