The Fed's next policy meeting will be held at the end of the month.\n\nOther crucial factors influencing investor sentiment this month include high-level trade negotiations between the United States and China next week and third-quarter corporate earnings reports.\n\nThe ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment Report, due at 8:15 a.m. ET (1215 GMT) is expected to show U.S. private payrolls grew by 140,000 jobs in September, fewer than the 195,000 added in August.\n\nThe report is seen as a precursor to the Labor Department's more comprehensive jobs report, due on Friday.\n\nAt 7:18 a.m. ET, were down 159 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 16.75 points, or 0.57% and were down 52.25 points, or 0.68%.\n\nActivision Blizzard Inc (O: ) dropped 2.6% in premarket trading after Bernstein downgraded the videogame maker's shares to \"market perform\".\n\nMonster Beverage Corp (O: ) fell 2.4% after the energy drink maker's stock was downgraded by Guggenheim to \"neutral.\"\n\nStitch Fix Inc (O: ) dropped 8.1% after the company forecast current-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates.\n\nShares in homebuilder Lennar Corp (N: ) gained 2.3% after the company reported better-than-expected profit as cheaper mortgage rates led to higher demand for its homes.", "description": "Wall Street set to open lower as manufacturing shock drags on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF910Y3_L.jpg"}
