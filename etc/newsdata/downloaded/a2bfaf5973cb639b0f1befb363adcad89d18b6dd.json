Pioneered by Amazon with the original Echo, the smart speaker market now has a bevy of competitors to choose from. But how do Amazon\u2019s new models compare?\n\nAmazon Echo Studio\n\nIf you want the best Echo speaker for music, the $199.99 Echo Studio is the one Amazon wants you to buy. It\u2019s got five drivers \u2014 a 1-inch tweeter, three 2-inch midrange speakers, and a 5.25-inch woofer \u2014 which should be able to show off Amazon Music HD, Amazon\u2019s new music streaming tier that offers lossless streaming. It also supports \u201c3D audio\u201d for the few tracks that support it, utilizing formats like Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio. New to the Echo lineup (but not Amazon\u2019s competitors) is the Echo Studio\u2019s ability to automatically tune its output for the room it\u2019s in. Like the regular Echo, the Echo Studio can play music from most of the popular music services.\n\nMy colleague Dan Seifert got a private listening session and said that the Echo Studio will \u201ceasily challenge\u201d other high-end smart speakers. And because it\u2019s priced lower than many of its competitors, it \u201cshould cause Sonos, Apple, and Google to sit up and listen.\u201d You can preorder the Echo Studio today, and Amazon says it will be available on November 7th.\n\nSonos One\n\nAt a price of $199, the Sonos One is a direct competitor to Amazon\u2019s new Echo Studio. However, while the Echo Studio is an Alexa-only affair, the Sonos One gives you much more freedom, with the option to use Alexa or Google Assistant.\n\nThe Sonos One is not able to sense and tailor its sound automatically depending on the room it\u2019s in. (For that, you\u2019ll have to go through the manual Sonos Trueplay tuning process.) But when it was released, the Sonos One held the crown as the best-sounding Alexa speaker at its price point. With the announcement of the Echo Studio, there\u2019s a chance that could change.\n\nApple HomePod\n\nApple\u2019s HomePod, launched in February 2018, comes with seven tweeters and one 4-inch woofer that are all controlled by an Apple A8 processor. It also has some neat tricks to quickly adjust its sound to best fit the room that it\u2019s in, like other smart speakers, but it comes in at a relatively high price of $299.\n\nLike many other Apple devices, the HomePod is tightly locked into its manufacturer\u2019s ecosystem. It uses Siri, which isn\u2019t quite as capable as Google\u2019s Assistant or Amazon\u2019s Alexa, with no option to change to a competing assistant. For now, Siri can only customize its responses to one person, though it will gain the ability to tailor responses to individual voices later this fall. You can also only use Apple Music natively. If you want to play music from another music service, you\u2019ll have to use AirPlay to stream it from your iPhone to the HomePod. That means the speaker isn\u2019t a great option if you mainly listen to Spotify on an Android device.\n\nStill, if you\u2019re married to the Apple ecosystem, you\u2019re not going to find Siri supported on any other smart speakers on this list, making the HomePod your only option.\n\nGoogle Home Max\n\nGoogle\u2019s $299 Google Home Max, released in late 2017, is Google\u2019s closest offering to Amazon and Apple\u2019s high-end speakers. It has four drivers: two 4.5-inch long-throw woofers and two 0.7-inch tweeters. According to Dan Seifert\u2019s review, it sounded better than \u201cany other smart speaker\u201d he had tested at that time. However, he said that it did not sound as good as Sonos\u2019 highest-end Play:5 speaker, which lacks a voice assistant.\n\nThe Google Home Max, like many other high-end smart speakers, can automatically tune itself to the room it\u2019s in using its microphones. Because it\u2019s a Google product, it runs Google Assistant. However, it has support for fewer music services than Amazon or Sonos.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of buying the Google Home Max today, you might want to hold off for a couple of weeks: Google has an event on October 15th where it\u2019s expected to announce new hardware, potentially including new speakers, so there\u2019s always a chance the Google Home Max could see an update.\n\nSonos Move\n\nSonos\u2019 Move, its new $399 portable speaker, only has one woofer and one tweeter. But in Dan Seifert\u2019s review, he found that the Move sounded \u201cclearer and crisper\u201d than Apple\u2019s HomePod, so it\u2019s no sound slouch. It has the now-table stakes of tuning itself to fit the room that it\u2019s in automatically. (On other Sonos speakers, this tuning process requires you to map the room with an app on your phone.)\n\nThe Move, unlike the other smart speakers on this list, is also designed to be, well, moved. It charges on an included base, and Sonos says it gets 10 hours of battery from the charger. It also supports Bluetooth to play music when it\u2019s away from a Wi-Fi network.\n\nLike the Sonos One but unlike other smart speakers listed here, the Move can run either Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google\u2019s Assistant, so you can pick which virtual assistant works best for you. Like Amazon\u2019s Echo, it also works with just about any music service you could want.\n\nAmazon Echo Studio Spec Comparison Specification Amazon Echo Studio Sonos One Apple HomePod Google Home Max Sonos Move Specification Amazon Echo Studio Sonos One Apple HomePod Google Home Max Sonos Move Voice Assistant Alexa Alexa, Google Assistant Siri Google Assistant Alexa, Google Assistant Connectivity Bluetooth, 3.5mm/mini-optical Toslink, Wi-Fi (exact standards tba) Ethernet, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, Sonos App AirPlay 2 3.5mm jack, Spotify Connect, Google Cast, Bluetooth Bluetooth, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, Sonos App Speaker Drivers 1-inch tweeter, 3 x 2-inch mid-range drivers, 5.25-inch woofer 1 x tweeter, 1 mid-woofer 4-inch woofer, 7 x tweeters 2 x 4.5-inch woofers, 2 x 0.7-inch tweeters 1 x tweeter, 1 x mid-woofer Expansion options Pair with second Echo Studio in stereo Pair with second Sonos One in stereo, or use as rear surround speakers with Sonos Beam, Playbar, Playbase Pair with second HomePod in stereo Pair with second Google Home Max in stereo Pair with second Sonos Move in stereo Weight (lbs) 7.7 4.08 5.5 11.7 6.61 Dimensions (in.) 8.1 x 6.9 x 6.9 6.36 x 4.69 x 4.69 6.8 x 5.6 x 5.6 13.2 x 7.4 x 6 9.44 x 6.29 x 4.96 Starting price $199 $199 $299 $299 $399 Misc.

It still costs $99.99, and, like other Echos, it can play music from just about any music service you could want, including Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora. It\u2019s got Alexa on board, but it lacks the Zigbee smart home hub that comes with the Echo Plus and Echo Studio, so it won\u2019t be as useful as those if you want it to be at the center of your smart home.\n\nIf you just need something to play music while you\u2019re doing things around your house, the Echo is probably a good option. You can preorder the new Echo today, and Amazon says it will start shipping on October 16th.\n\nIkea Symfonisk\n\nIkea\u2019s Symfonisk is a bit of an outlier on this list since it\u2019s the only speaker here that doesn\u2019t include a voice assistant. But we thought it was worth including since it can be dropped into an existing Sonos network, and its $99 price puts it in direct competition with the new Amazon Echo.\n\nWhen we reviewed it earlier this year, we thought it handily outperformed Amazon\u2019s current Echo in terms of sound quality. It also integrates neatly into the Sonos ecosystem, meaning you can control it using the Sonos app and use it as part of a Sonos multiroom setup. If you don\u2019t care about being able to control the speaker with your voice, then this is a pretty compelling option.\n\nGoogle Home\n\nOf course, the Google Home is a more direct competitor to Amazon\u2019s latest Echo device, especially after Amazon dropped its price to $99 earlier this year. However, Google\u2019s midrange smart speaker was first released back in 2016, and the hardware hasn\u2019t been updated since then, making this device almost three years old at this point.\n\nTechnically, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s not like smart speaker technology has drastically changed in the last three years. So if you want to get into Google\u2019s ecosystem rather than Amazon\u2019s, then this is your best option at this price point.\n\nAmazon Echo (3rd gen) Spec Comparison Specification Amazon Echo (3rd gen) Ikea Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker Google Home Specification Amazon Echo (3rd gen) Ikea Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker Google Home Voice Assistant Alexa N/A Google Assistant Connectivity Bluetooth, 3.5mm, Wi-Fi (exact standards tba) AirPlay 2, Sonos App, Spotify Connect Google Cast, Bluetooth Speaker Drivers 0.8-inch tweeter + 3-inch woofer 1.15-inch tweeter, 2.75-inch mid-range driver 2-inch driver, 2 x passive radiators Expansion options Pair with second Amazon Echo in stereo, and add Echo Sub for 2.1 system.

Dolby processing\n\nSo, which to pick?\n\nWe have yet to fully review the Amazon Echo Studio or the third-generation Echo, so it\u2019s impossible to say how either of Amazon\u2019s new speakers will stack up against the immediate competition.\n\nBased on specs alone, however, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s not much of a gap between many of the speakers on the market. The best speaker for you will likely come down to which ecosystem of devices you\u2019re currently invested in. Sonos is a good pick if you\u2019re still on the fence, unsure if you\u2019re the Alexa type or the Google Assistant type but definitely not the Siri type.", "description": "Among Amazon\u2019s avalanche of announcements at its 2019 fall hardware event, it announced two new smart speakers: a third-generation Echo and a high-end speaker called the Echo Studio.
