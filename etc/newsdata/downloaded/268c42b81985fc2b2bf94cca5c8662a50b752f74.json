It was identified during the testing phase and before any users gained access to the system.\n\nThe bug could have reportedly allowed an attacker to steal all of the collateral stored in the MCD system \u2014 possibly via a single transaction. In return for the critical finding, the user was awarded a $50,000 bounty from MakerDAO\u2019s bounty program.", "description": "The Maker Foundation\u2019s CEO reveals that its Multi-Collateral Dai system will be ready to launch on November 18", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMzBhMzJjZTg4NjA5NmYxZjQ3MDk0ODJkNGY2NzVlM2EuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
