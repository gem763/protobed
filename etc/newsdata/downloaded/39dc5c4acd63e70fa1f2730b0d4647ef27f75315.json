(Mary Altaffer/AP)\n\nMarcello Giordani, an Italian tenor who gave his first performances for customers at his father\u2019s gas station in Sicily and rose to international fame on the opera stage, where he received ovations for the ringing power of his voice, died Oct. 5 at his home in the Sicilian town of Augusta. He was 56.\n\nThe cause was a heart attack, said his manager, Katherine Olsen.\n\nMr. Giordani had loved the opera since his youth, when he recalled weeping in the back rows of a modest local theater as the music washed over him, but he attended no conservatory and did not study music seriously until after he had begun a safe, dependable career at a bank.\n\nFueled by what he described as his sense of \u201crebellion and ambition,\u201d he quit his job at 19 and set out for Milan to train as an opera singer. He credited his success in part to his father, a former prison guard who also loved the opera and provided financial and moral support.\n\n\u201cIt was a scandal,\u201d he told the Washington Times years later. \u201cThere was fear from everybody; they were against it, leaving a secure job with a good salary, pension, health insurance, to do this. They thought it was madness.\u201d\n\nAfter rising through European and American opera houses, Mr. Giordani became a mainstay of the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He debuted with the company in 1993 as the besotted bumpkin Nemorino in Donizetti\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d in a concert staging of the opera in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park and made his last performance at the Met in 2016 as the troubadour Manrico in Verdi\u2019s \u201cIl Trovatore.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Giordani, left, sings in the role of Ramerrez opposite soprano Deborah Voigt as Minnie in a dress rehearsal of Puccini's \u201cLa Fanciulla del West\u201d at the Met in 2010. (Mary Altaffer/AP)\n\nThe 240 performances in between \u2014 as well as his appearances opposite sopranos including Kiri Te Kanawa and Ren\u00e9e Fleming and in houses including Milan\u2019s La Scala, the Royal Opera House in London\u2019s Covent Garden and the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires \u2014 established him as a premier tenor of his generation.\n\nMr. Giordani lacked the popular name recognition of the Three Tenors \u2014 Luciano Pavarotti, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jose Carreras \u2014 and his closer contemporaries Roberto Alagna and Rolando Villaz\u00f3n. But in an art form in which passions run as high in the audience as they do onstage, he thrilled operagoers with his high notes and ardent acting.\n\n\u201cMarcello Giordani sang like a god,\u201d classical music critic Anne Midgette wrote in a New York Times review of his performance with the Opera Orchestra of New York in a concert staging of Cilea\u2019s \u201cAdriana Lecouvreur\u201d at Carnegie Hall in 2002.\n\nMr. Giordani was best known for his command of bel canto operas, the later works of the Italian composers Verdi and Puccini, and French operas including Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon\u201d and Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen.\u201d (He ventured into the Russian repertoire as Lensky in Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d a role he performed at the Met in 2001 and 2002.)\n\nThe Met twice gave Mr. Giordani the honor of opening a new season at the house \u2014 first in 2006, when he sang the part of Pinkerton opposite Chilean soprano Cristina Gallardo-Dom\u00e2s in Puccini\u2019s \u201cMadama Butterfly,\u201d and again the next year when he was Edgardo to Natalie Dessay\u2019s Lucia in Donizetti\u2019s \u201cLucia di Lammermoor.\u201d\n\n1 of 60 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

When other top tenors canceled performances, whether for ill health, personal conflict or in a temperamental outburst, opera companies called on Mr. Giordani to step in \u2014 ensuring not only that the show would go on, but that it would feature a star.\n\nThe Times reported that he once agreed to appear at the Met in Verdi\u2019s \u201cRigoletto\u201d with eight hours\u2019 notice. In 2008, he appeared in a regularly scheduled matinee performance of Berlioz\u2019s \u201cLa Damnation de Faust,\u201d then returned that evening to fill in for a sick tenor in \u201cMadama Butterfly.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarcello Giordani is a wonderful artist,\u201d Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the Times after those events, \u201cbut also the iron man of tenors.\u201d\n\nMr. Giordani was born Marcello Guagliardo on Jan. 25, 1963, in Augusta, in eastern Sicily. He later took the stage name Giordani because Guagliardo proved difficult for non-Italian speakers to pronounce, his manager said.\n\nMr. Giordani scored his first musical coup in 1986, when he appeared at the Spoleto festival in Italy as the Duke in \u201cRigoletto.\u201d He later sang at La Scala and then at regional opera houses across the United States, where he said he received an education in the dramatic elements of opera.\n\n\u201cI was lucky to start in this country,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cTheatrically I am self-taught. The Italians are not indulgent, as Americans are. They don\u2019t have the patience to teach young singers how to move. They think you should learn in school.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, he suffered a vocal crisis that he attributed to his spotty early musical training. He entrusted himself to the vocal teacher Bill Schuman in New York, whom he credited with honing and ultimately preserving his voice for an extended career.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel embarrassed to talk about my vocal crisis,\u201d Mr. Giordani once told the Newhouse News Service. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that young singers understand we are human beings, we can have our problems.\u201d\n\nSurvivors include his Swiss-born wife, Wilma Ahrens, whom he married in 1990; two sons, Michele Guagliardo and Gerard Andre Guagliardo; and three brothers. His family resided in Augusta, where Mr. Giordani had a home, in addition to an apartment he kept in New York City.\n\n\u201cSicily is a blessed land,\u201d he remarked to the Times, commenting, perhaps obliquely, on the forces that led him to the opera. \u201cFirst, because of its geographic position in the Mediterranean. Second, for its history and all the different peoples who have settled there: Arabs, Greeks, Normans, the Swedes. That has made us different from others. We exaggerate, we overdo. We love Greek tragedy. We cry, we fight, sometimes for nothing. We don\u2019t have the middle of the line. We\u2019re on the edge.\u201d", "description": "The singer, who died Oct. 5 of a heart attack, gave his first performances for customers at his father\u2019s gas station in Sicily and rose to international stardom on the opera stage.", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Q2Egbhp5U85fpYubuGjX-L41LTg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQ5DHRHJ3YI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
