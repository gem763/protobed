Instead of the gunpowder shooting the powder out the top of the stand, the stand exploded sending metal pieces flying.\"\n\n\"One of these metal pieces struck Pamela Kreimeyer in the head causing instant death.\n\n\"She was standing with other family members approximately 45 feet from the device. It is believed that the projectile that struck the victim then continued another 144 yards through the air coming to rest in a field.\"\n\nPolice said the incident remains under investigation.", "description": "Pamela Kreimeyer died after the pink and blue powder display at the party in Knoxville, Iowa, exploded 'like a pipe bomb'", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756825.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pamela-Kreimeyer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
