Photo: John Lamparski/Getty Images\n\nEdi Patterson\u2019s latest TV role is a big one on HBO\u2019s The Righteous Gemstones, but she\u2019s been in the comedy game for a long time. From her early years as an improviser in Austin, to joining the Groundlings in Los Angeles, to eventually joining the cast of Damon Wayans\u2019s short-lived sketch show The Underground, Patterson\u2019s slowly racked up an impressive list of accomplishments, and it keeps growing, year after year.\n\nMore recently, Patterson landed a recurring role as Ms. Abbott in Vice Principals in 2016. Which would be exciting enough for an actor alone, but Patterson and Vice Principals star-creator Danny McBride had such an instant and familial bond that they wrote a movie together soon after the show wrapped. \u201cAnything he did I would know how to go with,\u201d says Patterson. \u201cAnd anything I did he would know how to go with, in a fun way.\u201d\n\nEventually, when McBride was putting together the cast for his next HBO project, The Righteous Gemstones, he of course asked Patterson to play his sister Judy Gemstone as well as join the writing staff. She\u2019s excited to be doing what she loves, and that may be why so many great places are excited to have her.\n\nPatterson recently spoke with Vulture about the writing process with McBride, her delayed reaction process to finding her comedic voice in improv, and why it\u2019s always helped her to say \u201cFuck it.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve said that you and Danny McBride had an instant connection when you were acting on Vice Principals, which led to you writing together as well. How did the writing side of things come to be between you and McBride?\n\nWhen we finished Vice Principals, we had just been talking about writing together. At first we were trying to work on a movie together \u2060\u2014 a brother-sister movie \u2060\u2014 and honestly, the impetus of the idea was something where we could physically beat the shit out of each other because that made us laugh. And then one of the days I came in he was like \u201cOh, I had this other idea,\u201d and it was about me being the mom of this young actor for a four-day adventure. So we just started writing it and found we write really well together and wrote a couple of things, actually. Then he had the idea for Gemstones come up, and he asked me to play Judy, and of course I jumped at that. After HBO said they wanted more episodes of the show, he asked me to come write for this season.\n\nDo you expect something to come of the mom-actor movie?\n\nYeah, I think we\u2019ll make that one at some point. It\u2019s called The Kevin Bacon Movie, and I think Danny will direct. I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll do it, but I do know we\u2019ll do it at some point.\n\nWhat\u2019s the writing process like between the two of you?\n\nOur initial approaches are different in that he will hammer something all the way out, and then go \u201cThis felt weird,\u201d and then hammer it all the way out again. He has such a knack for making it better every time. I come from such an improv background that my initial thought is usually like All these ideas are awesome; let\u2019s pick one and we\u2019ll make it awesome. But he takes time in that initial phase of \u201cLet\u2019s get it all out, and then let\u2019s see if that works.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also very prolific, very fast, and can crank out a scene, and it\u2019s genuinely smart and funny when you read it, which is sort of staggering how all of the elements can come together so fast. I\u2019m a little different in that sometimes I need to stare at the laptop for a little while or pace, and then an idea will sort of come in sideways. I tend to stare in that initial phase and he will just start working, and he\u2019s not afraid to work it again and again.\n\nAs a writer on Gemstones, were there any specific stories, moments, or character choices in this season that you pulled from real life?\n\n\ufeffI don\u2019t know of a specific story from my life, but I do think that with all the characters, Judy included, I know from my own life how she deals, even when hers is turned up to 11 or louder than how I\u2019ve felt the feeling. Everyone knows what it\u2019s like to feel like you\u2019re not understood, frustrated, or not seen \u2060\u2014 like you\u2019re a badass and then maybe a second later go, \u201cOh was I not a badass?\u201d I definitely know all those feelings. And I think the thing with all these characters is that it\u2019s all regular human stuff and then you let it rip. They have less filter and they\u2019re more entitled, and when they feel something or think something, there\u2019s almost, like, a permission from God: Well, what I\u2019m thinking or feeling must be right.\n\nWhat about your character Judy specifically? Was anything from your life an inspiration behind the character?\n\nShe doesn\u2019t come from anyone I know. It\u2019s kind of like that volume or frequency thing: letting certain emotions rip and then turning them up or down. I\u2019m sure on some subconscious level there\u2019s a \u201cgrowing up in Texas\u201d aspect in there somewhere in Judy of sort of knowing kind of what all this is. I didn\u2019t go to a mega-church, but I grew up going to church every Sunday \u2060\u2014 Sunday school, all that stuff, so I think it all becomes a mix, and it\u2019s in there, but she\u2019s not based on anyone specifically that I know.\n\nYou started doing improv at the Hideout Theatre in Austin, right? What was that experience like at the onset of your improv career?\n\nThat was the first place that I did improv shows for audiences, and I was out of my mind because it felt so exactly right to me. It was so exciting that I couldn\u2019t even contain my happiness and energy. I think I had a base-level aptitude for improv. I think I had a certain amount of God-given talent for it but \u2060\u2014 all-caps BUT \u2060\u2014 I was such a spaz because I was just beginning, and part of my thing was that I couldn\u2019t contain my fucking joy of improvising in front of people.\n\nWhen did you find your voice?\n\nI think I had some semblance of recognition of that from the jump, but I honestly, think that it\u2019s like a Malcolm Gladwell 10,000-hours thing. I just kept doing it and doing it. You make these realizations, and they happen in your body first and then later you go Oh that\u2019s when I realized to stop trying \u2060\u2014 don\u2019t try to say funny things, just listen, or That\u2019s when I realized that silence is awesome in a scene.\n\nIn the moment it\u2019s not a lightning bolt. I think later you go Oh shit, that\u2019s when I figured that out. I do think it\u2019s one of those things, in an exciting way, that I think you figure out all the time. And if you want to be really good, you have to know that you don\u2019t know anything. Ultimately I don\u2019t know anything, I have so much to learn still, and I think that\u2019s so exciting.\n\nYou spent two weeks as a guest writer on SNL in 2013. How did you end up getting that opportunity, and what did you end up coming away with from the experience?\n\nThey came to a showcase at Groundlings, and I did a couple things that they dug. I can\u2019t remember who came \u2060\u2014 maybe Colin Jost and a couple other people. They liked the two pieces that I had in that and asked me to come guest write for a couple weeks. It was cool to see how it all works, and you come away with this feeling of If I have to, I can write a whole thing in a week. I\u2019m not saying that would be a great thing to do, but you came away from it thinking I now know that if I need to, I can do anything.\n\nI got something on both weeks, which was a very cool thing in that I got to have a whole experience. One thing was a live sketch, and one that I contributed to was a filmed piece that I sort of got to help produce and direct. I felt like I got to have this very cool full experience that maybe even is an anomaly for a two-week stint like that.\n\nDid you expect it to turn into something longer, especially given that you had early success?\n\nThe second you\u2019re done, you don\u2019t expect anything. You just think I did that and it was really cool. They did contact me a couple times in the next year or two, but both times I was busy working on something else. One time I was still under contract for this show that I had done ten episodes of, and the second time I was in the second season of Vice Principals. They did call to see what was up. I don\u2019t know what that would have entailed, but I think everything works out the way it\u2019s supposed to.\n\nIf someone reading this wanted to follow in your footsteps as either an actor, writer, or improviser, what would be your advice to any of those aspirations, or perhaps something that covers all three?\n\nThe quicker you can get your head to a place of \u201cFuck it\u201d in a really fun way \u2060\u2014 and for me \u201cFuck it\u201d has no negative connotations, it\u2019s really positive, like a fun shrug of the shoulder \u2060\u2014 the sooner you can get to that and not care or put onus on what the outcome is. You see in that moment, whether you\u2019re writing a scene or going into an audition for something, that so many times the nerves can get weird [and] the more important you think the job is for your life. It messes your brain up, I think. Same with improv. All those thoughts are garbage, so the sooner you can get your brain to Fuck it \u2060\u2014 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but I know that I\u2019m going to be here for whatever shows up and be open to it. And I know whatever shows up is going to be better than what I can try to manufacture right now. That\u2019s my advice, if that makes any sense. Work hard, work your ass off, but get some \u201cFuck it\u201d in your head as soon as you can.", "description": "An interview with writer, actor, and improviser Edi Patterson about writing and starring on HBO\u2019s \u2018The Righteous Gemstones,\u2019 working with Danny McBride, what improv taught her, and her advice for aspriring writes and actors.", "authors": ["Kenneth Arthur"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-edi-patterson-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
