Associate director Jim Spencer (seen) said first edition hardbacks of Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone are the 'holy grail' for collectors because so few were printed\n\nThe rare edition went under the hammer alongside 12 other Harry Potter first editions with a guide price of \u00a325,000 to \u00a330,000, and bids poured in from around the globe.\n\nThe book was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder, and the purchase price does not include VAT and buyer's premium.\n\nIts original owners decided to sell after reading about a first edition of the same book which was sold in July, also at an Hansons auction, for \u00a328,500.\n\nIt had been bought as a gift by the family's relative before being gifted to the vendors, retired civil servants from Lancashire who wish to remain anonymous.\n\nSpeaking after the auction today, the husband said: 'It's been locked away in a briefcase along with a first edition of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nThe book, a 1997 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone first edition, was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder today after being kept in a briefcase for 22 years\n\nThe plan was to keep them as family heirlooms, which is why my wife put them in a briefcase. It was to stop the pages turning yellow.\n\n'Both books were posted to us as gifts by an aunt when they were first published. She bought them at an independent book shop which recommended the first Harry Potter book as suitable reading for a young family.\n\n'We used to read it to our children at bedtime in the late 1990s and they were riveted. The second book was eagerly awaited and the whole family was hooked by the magic of Harry Potter.\n\n'When we read about the first edition being sold at Hansons, we thought what's the use of our books lying around in a briefcase when a collector might treasure them.'\n\nAssociate director Jim Spencer said first edition hardbacks of Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone are the 'holy grail' for collectors because so few were printed.\n\nThe back of the book features the typo of 'Philosopher's' spelled wrong\n\nSpencer said that after the sale of the Harry Potter book in July, he had been receiving up to 50 enquiries and emails a day from people who thought they too might have a first edition.\n\nHe said: 'Due to amazing news coverage across the UK and as far afield as Japan and Korea, we were flooding with emails and enquiries from people who thought they might have a first edition. At one point I was receiving 50 emails a day.\n\n'A first edition hardback of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the holy grail for collectors as so few were printed. To find another one so soon after the July sale has knocked my socks off.\n\nHow to spot if you have a first edition Harry Potter book Book expert Jim Spencer says: 'The publication line must read '10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1'. 'If that line stops at say 3, it's a third impression; if it stops at 8 it's an eighth impression and so on. It has to go down to 1.'\n\n'The owners took such great care of their precious cargo they brought it to me in a briefcase, which they unlocked with a code. It felt like we were dealing in smuggled diamonds.\n\n'I couldn't believe the condition of it - almost like the day it was made. I can't imagine a better copy can be found.\n\n'Only 500 copies of the true first impression hardback were printed, 300 of which were sent to libraries and schools. This new discovery is scarcer than the previous find, which was a former Staffordshire library book. It deserves to fetch much more.'\n\nHe added: 'It famously contains two typographical errors including '1 wand' being printed twice in a list and there's an incorrect spelling of 'Philosopher's' on the back cover.\n\n'However, the most crucial issue point of all is that the publication line must read '10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1'. If that line stops at say 3, it's a third impression; if it stops at 8 it's an eighth impression and so on. It has to go down to 1.'\n\nAuctioneer Charles Hanson added:'It was a book like no other. It had been kept in a briefcase for two decades. It's exquisite. I doubt if there is another one like it out there.'", "description": "A rare first edition of the first Harry Potter book has fetched a staggering \u00a346,000 at auction, after it was kept in a briefcase for more than 22 years.", "authors": ["Jessica Rach For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19544288-0-image-a-14_1570718493243.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
