It allows for limited exceptions.\n\nIt had been scheduled to become enforceable on January 1.\n\nLawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights in June filed a constitutional challenge to the law on behalf of Georgia abortion providers and an advocacy group.\n\nUS District Judge Steve Jones wrote in an order Tuesday that the current laws governing abortion in the state shall remain in effect for the time being.\n\nKemp's office had no immediate comment on the ruling, spokesman Cody Hall said.\n\n\"Today is a tremendous victory for the women of Georgia and for the Constitution,\" ACLU of Georgia legal director Sean Young said. \"Politicians have no business telling women or couples when to start or expand a family. This case has always been about one thing: Letting her decide.\"\n\n190514142646289\n\nThe law makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest, as long as the woman files a police report first. It also allows for abortions when the life of the woman is at risk or when a fetus is determined not to be viable because of a serious medical condition.\n\nAdditionally, it declares an embryo or fetus a \"natural person\" once cardiac activity can be detected, saying that is the point where \"the full value of a child begins.\" That would make the fetus a dependent minor for tax purposes and trigger child support obligations.\n\nThe so-called \"heartbeat law\" is one of a wave of laws passed recently by Republican-controlled legislatures in an attack on the US Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that legalised abortion nationwide.\n\nNone of the bans has taken effect. Some have already been blocked, and elsewhere courts are considering requests to put them on hold while legal challenges play out.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy organisation, nearly 60 abortion restrictions have been enacted in 2019 as of September 15.", "description": "The so-called 'heartbeat' law is the latest to be blocked by a judge while challenges to the measure plays out in court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/5/21/b77d7afa9a03496fbc2c1b0d962f1220_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
