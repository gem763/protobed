(AP) - The Navy defense backed another dominant performance on the ground by senior quarterback Malcolm Perry in a 35-3 victory over South Florida on Saturday.\n\nPerry finished with 188 yards on 22 carries with a pair of touchdowns. He surpassed more than 3,000 career yards rushing in his career, joining Keenan Reynolds, Napoleon McCallum and Chris McCoy as the only Navy players to accomplish that feat.\n\nThe Midshipmen have a three-game winning streak for the first time since 2017 when they won five straight to start the year.\n\nJunior linebacker Jacob Springer notched a career-high three sacks and cornerback freshman Chelen Garnes had an interception for Navy (5-1, 3-1 American Athletic Conference). The Midshipmen have 17 sacks on the year after finishing with 10 last season.\n\nSouth Florida (3-4, 1-2) stacked the box with 11 defenders most of the game but Navy still managed to find seams and finished with a season-high 434 yards rushing.\n\nBulls redshirt freshman quarterback Jordan McCloud, who took over the starting job for the injured Blake Barnett (ankle), was 11 of 23 for 50 yards with an interception.\n\nPerry opened the scoring with 67-yard touchdown run with 3:56 left in the first quarter. Navy had a couple of key stops and capitalized with a 58-yard rumble by fullback Jamale Carothers on the opening play of the second quarter that extended the lead to 14-0.\n\nThe Bulls could not capitalize on three forced turnovers (two interceptions and a fumble recovery).\n\nNavy used some creativity to pull further away when slotback CJ Williams took the pitch from Perry and threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to OJ Davis for a three-score margin.\n\nBulls\u2019 cornerback KJ Sails gave them some life with an apparent pick-6, but the score was nullified because of an illegal block. South Florida had to settle for a 33-yard field goal by Spencer Shrader and trailed 21-3 at the break.\n\nAfter a scoreless third quarter, Navy completed the rout on a 21-yard run by Perry and a 26-yard scamper by Tazh Maloy.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSouth Florida: The Bulls had won their previous two games, but that momentum came to a halt against the Midshipmen\u2019s tenacious defense. South Florida now has to deal with the tougher portion of its schedule with four of five games against teams in the Top 25 or received votes.\n\nNavy: The Midshipmen have already surpassed their win total (three) from last season and are surging toward bowl-eligibility. The revamped defense under new coordinator Brian Newberry has taken some of the pressure off Perry and helped set the tone for this year\u2019s success.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouth Florida: The Bulls play a second straight road contest Oct. 26 at East Carolina.\n\nNavy: The Midshipmen host Tulane for homecoming Oct. 26.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Navy defense backed another dominant performance on the ground by senior quarterback Malcolm Perry in a 35-3 victory over South Florida on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Todd Karpovich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/south_florida_navy_football_32046_c0-901-2657-2450_s1200x700.jpg?fef2a36591ae78838906a116708a8ad07e275787", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
