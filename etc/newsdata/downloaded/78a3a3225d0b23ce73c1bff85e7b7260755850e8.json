Three others were found guilty of disobedience but will not serve prison time.\n\nTorra, who was elected in May as the first Catalan leader since former Prime Minister Carles Puigdemont\u2019s administration was sacked in 2018, campaigned on a secessionist agenda.\n\n\u201cIf we are sentenced to 100 years for putting self-determination to the ballot box, the answer is clear: Self-determination must be put to the ballot box,\u201d he told Parliament on Thursday.\n\nNot all separatist leaders in Parliament supported Torra\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cNow is not the moment to set deadlines,\u201d said Sergi Sabri\u00e0, a member of Parliament who belongs to the Republican Left of Catalonia Party.\n\nProtests began Monday shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, and have continued for four days. The BBC reported that at least 96 people have sustained injuries in the demonstrations.\n\nTorra called for an end to the violence, which he blamed on infiltrators.\n\n\u201cWe will not permit incidents like those we are seeing in the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to stop right now. There is no reason nor justification for burning cars, nor any other vandalism.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 Catalan President Quim Torra on Thursday said he plans to push for another independence referendum as the region undergoes the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
