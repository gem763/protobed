The league isn\u2019t panicking \u2014 yet.", "language": "en", "text": "The NFL is not jumping to such early-season conclusions, however. According to multiple people familiar with the views of league leaders, NFL decision-makers believe the new system is working reasonably well thus far, given the limitations of making judgment calls subject to replay scrutiny. The league\u2019s leaders think the onus is on coaches, who pushed hard for the replay change made last offseason, to adjust to the rulings being made from New York by Al Riveron, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president of officiating.\n\n\u201cI remain concerned,\u201d said one of those people with knowledge of the league\u2019s inner workings, stressing there always were reservations about replay being involved in subjective calls. \u201cBut actually, I feel pretty good about where it is. The line for reversal [of an on-field call] is going to be high. If you would move that line, it\u2019s going to be even more confusing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe coaches\u2019 complaints are not surprising given that a judgment call remains a judgment call even when subjected to replay, said that person and others familiar with the league\u2019s thinking. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the controversy surrounding the topic.\n\n\u201cAny time you deal in the world of subjectivity, you\u2019re going to have issues,\u201d that person said. \u201cIt\u2019s been okay. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s been perfect. I think New York has done about as well as it can with this. There are going to be growing pains with this. That was always going to be the case.\u201d\n\nAnother person with knowledge of the NFL\u2019s views expressed similar sentiments, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s really about reminding the coaches: \u2018This is what you asked for.\u2019 \u201d Of the rulings being made by Riveron, that person said: \u201cHe\u2019s left it in the stadium. For the vast majority it\u2019s a stay [with the original on-field call]. Is a surprise? No.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoaches seem to have a different view.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what it is going to look like moving forward,\u201d Pittsburgh Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin, a member of the NFL\u2019s rulemaking competition committee, said at a news conference last week after losing a replay challenge of an offensive pass interference call made against the Steelers during a win over the Cincinnati Bengals. \u201cIf anybody does, I\u2019d appreciate it. I don\u2019t think any of us have a feel on what that looks like.\u201d\n\nTomlin called the interference rulings being made on replay \u201ca moving target\u201d for coaches.\n\nAfter losing a challenge on which he tried to get defensive pass interference called against the Philadelphia Eagles in a game late last month, Green Bay Packers Coach Matt LaFleur said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what pass interference is any more.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut trends have emerged. Coaches, it seems, have been slow to realize it is nearly impossible to have an on-field call of pass interference overturned, even when there is only slight contact involved. There is a better chance to have a non-call reversed via replay, although even that remains a long shot.\n\nThrough the first four weeks of the season, there was only one reversal of a pass interference penalty called on the field \u2014 including both offensive and defensive pass interference \u2014 among seven replay reviews. There were six reversals among 24 replay reviews of interference non-calls. That made, in all, seven reversals among 31 reviews.\n\nCoaches were among the leading advocates for the rule change ratified by the owners in March, on the heels of the missed pass interference call victimizing the New Orleans Saints in their loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC title game in January, which made interference calls and non-calls subject to replay reviews. Coaches were said at the time to be unanimous in their support.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe competition committee had expressed wariness, based on its long-standing reluctance to make judgment calls by the on-field officials reviewable. Owners approved the new system on a one-year basis, meaning it will be up for reconsideration after this season.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday in his weekly radio appearance on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that those in the league should \u201cbe careful what you wish for.\u201d The Cowboys\u2019 Jason Garrett was among the coaches who pushed the hardest in March for the change. But Jones said Tuesday that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to sit there and add another layer of judgment\u201d to officiating with replay reviews of interference.\n\n\u201cReplay, in my mind, should be there for a very egregious situation that just was blatantly missed,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think the one in New Orleans, the one that started this recent rule, was egregious and should have been reviewed. But to have it on every play and have it at the will of the coach to make those calls, to have it done that way, is really kind of not as succinct as I like to see officiating.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor now, the NFL is taking a wait-and-see approach, hoping that coaches make the necessary adjustments and that the perception of the new system changes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never changed a [major] rule where some people weren\u2019t saying we\u2019ve ruined the game,\u201d one of those people familiar with the league\u2019s views on the topic said. \u201cOfficiating is going to be criticized. That\u2019s just the world we live in.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "League leaders believe it\u2019s up to the coaches, who pushed hard for the new replay system, to adjust to how the rulings on pass interference calls are being made.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OIGF0HjLmYqWlS6isfHzS0ibJ9M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ORAJ5TGX7EI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
