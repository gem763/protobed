Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Sunday that he now supports the move.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m increasingly optimistic this could turn out very well,\u201d Graham told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. \u201cI am increasingly optimistic that we can have some historic solutions in Syria that have eluded us for years, if we play our cards right.\u201d\n\nGraham said he spoke with Trump over the weekend and that the president assured him the United States is not abandoning the Kurds, who suffered 10,000 killed in fighting against ISIS terrorists. (The United States, which supported the Kurds with arms and a relatively small contingent of special operations forces, lost eight lives in the five-year battle, Graham noted.)\n\n\u201cThe president appreciates what the Kurds have done,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe wants to make sure ISIS doesn\u2019t come back. I expect we will continue to partner with the Kurds into eastern Syria to make sure ISIS doesn\u2019t reemerge. That is in our national security interests, and we owe it to the Kurds.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s remarks came two days after the White House announced it had brokered a temporary ceasefire in Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria. Critics, including Graham, had said Trump effectively caved to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nRemove Graham from the list of critics.\n\n\u201cI blame Erdogan for the invasion, not Trump,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe big thing for me is the oil fields,\u201d Graham added. \u201cPresident Trump is thinking outside the box. I was so impressed with his thinking about the oil. Not only are we going to deny the oil fields falling into Iranian hands, I believe we\u2019re on the verge of a joint venture between us and the Syrian Democratic Forces, who helped destroy ISIS and keep them destroyed, to modernize the oil fields and make sure they get the revenue, not the Iranians, not Assad.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham (Photos: Leah Millis/Reuters, Alex Edelman/Bloomberg via Getty Images) More\n\nIn a separate interview that was taped early last week with \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d but that aired Sunday, Graham said he would be open to the possibility of impeachment if there is evidence of what he considers a quid pro quo in the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine \u2014 beyond the phone call that is at the center of the current inquiry.\n\n\u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,\u201d Graham said when asked if he was open to changing his mind on impeachment.\n\nGraham, who served in the House during the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, said he did not consider the phone call a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read the transcript of the Ukrainian phone call,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a quid pro quo to me.\u201d\n\nThose comments were made before a White House press briefing in which Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, did not dispute the assertion that Trump\u2019s withholding of aid to Ukraine in exchange for political dirt amounted a quid pro quo. \u201cWe do that all the time,\u201d he added.\n\nHours later, Mulvaney released a statement saying he did not mean what he had said.\n\nDuring the July 25 phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, his son Hunter \u2014 who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company during his father\u2019s term as vice president \u2014 and the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia in 2016.\n\nAt the time of the call, Trump had ordered a suspension of aid to Ukraine unless certain conditions were met, including Zelensky\u2019s cooperation on the investigations.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters at the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nGraham wasn\u2019t asked about Mulvaney\u2019s admission during his Fox News interview, and he hasn\u2019t commented on whether it constitutes sufficient evidence of a quid pro quo to affect his view of impeachment.", "description": "After spending a week railing against President Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria, Sen.
