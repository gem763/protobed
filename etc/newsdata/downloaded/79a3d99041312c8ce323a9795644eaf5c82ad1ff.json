In total, seven were arrested in connection with past protest-related offenses, police said.\n\nThe arrests could further inflame tensions in the city after an already tense week. Last Sunday, a Hong Kong police officer fired a live shot into the air during protests for the first time. Later in the week, Chief Executive Carrie Lam refused to rule out invoking emergency powers and a prominent protest organizer was attacked by masked men carrying baseball bats and knives.\n\nWong and Chow were released on bail Friday evening. Addressing journalists on the steps of the courthouse, Wong said told reporters that \"the Beijing government are the ones who back and endorse Hong Kong police to conduct such a mass arrest and prosecution.\"\n\nChow described the arrests as a scare tactic, telling reporters, \"We can see very clearly that the regime and the HK government is trying to create a White Terror to try to scare Hong Kong people to not participate in the social and democratic movement of the future.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "Several high-profile pro-democracy leaders were swept up in a series of arrests on Thursday and Friday in Hong Kong, ahead of what will be the 13th consecutive weekend of mass protests in the Asian financial hub.", "authors": ["Helen Regan", "Angus Watson", "Ezra Cheung", "Jadyn Sham"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190830093305-joshua-wong-0702-super-tease.jpg"}
