From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMy husband\u2019s parents, a carpenter and a school canteen assistant can be described as working class. Through thrift and hard work they owned their own house (two up, two down terrace) and had a car. My husband was educated in state schools, the latter being another excellent grammar school, and from there went to Oxford University. After university, he spent 2 years working for CMS in Iran, and returned to become an articled clerk in accountancy. Was he more working class than me?\n\nAudrey Boucher\n\nOakley\n\nAn opioid crisis is on the way\n\nWe are not in the grip of a US-style opioid crisis. But the warning signs are there.\n\nHalf a million people currently rely on opioids as a long-term painkiller, according to research published yesterday by Public Health England. And six out of 10 people with a musculoskeletal condition have been prescribed an opioid painkiller in the last year.\n\nDespite persistent pain affecting up to half of the UK population, the understanding of it and provision of effective treatment is woeful. For many, opioids can be the answer, so shouldn\u2019t be demonised. But they\u2019re not a silver bullet and can cause harmful side effects like addiction.\n\nWe need to transform the way we approach persistent pain in the UK. More people need greater access to non-drug options like physio, exercise plans or talking therapies. They also need clearer information and to have the opportunity to participate in their care and support planning. Healthcare professionals need greater levels of training and support. This week we announced the biggest single investment in pain research in the UK, potentially Europe, to better understand the complex causes and treatments of pain. But we need more and sustained investment.\n\nLet\u2019s make changes now so people in persistent pain get the care and support they desperately need and deserve.\n\nLiam O\u2019Toole, CEO Versus Arthritis\n\nAlarmist opioid warnings\n\nI read with interest reports on Public Health England\u2019s study of prescriptions.\n\nImportant though this review is, I must ask: how can it possibly be helpful for commentators to frame the debate in this way \u2013 as the usage of these medicines being some sort of social evil? Surely this will cause a panic that will put yet more strain on GPs and prevent people from seeking the help they need. And it ignores the inconvenient truth that some people do need these medicines for their conditions and to use them long term.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t dispute that these drugs have risks \u2013 and some people have suffered dearly because of them \u2013 I\u2019d contend that the conditions they treat cause the same, if not far more, damage and misery. With a government agency spreading such alarmist headlines as \u201cone in four on addictive drugs\u201d, I fear many more people will be put off seeking treatment for these painful conditions.\n\nSam Buckley\n\nAddress supplied\n\nA general election solution\n\nA general election is coming. The Conservative and Labour parties remain split on Brexit and fear defections to the Brexit Party. The prime minister says he wants a deal. There is a strong opposition alliance to prevent no deal backed up by legislation. Surely, the best way to resolve this is to have two questions on the ballot paper: \u201cWhich party do you wish to see in power?\u201d and \u201cWould you prefer to remain in the EU or continue to pursue a deal?\u201d The first question would obviously relate to the voters\u2019 constituencies. The second would provide a binding national referendum.\n\nPatrick Cosgrove\n\nShropshire\n\nMeat-free universities\n\nSo universities like Cambridge and Goldsmiths are removing red meat from menus to reduce their carbon footprint. But have they ever considered that the business model of the modern UK university \u2013 one that relies on importing large numbers of foreign students from far-away countries \u2013 is ecologically unsustainable?\n\nIf you take into account the aggregated carbon footprint created by the flights undertaken by students \u2013 many long haul \u2013 along with the impact of the international junkets enjoyed by so many academics, the university sector looks a whole lot less clean than it perhaps likes to think.\n\nDavid Stocker\n\nLancaster\n\nA government of hypocrites\n\nThe outrage expressed by Boris Johnson\u2019s aides (including, no doubt, Dominic Cummings) at the motion in parliament that they hand over all communications, including private ones, in order to test the true motives behind the decision to prorogue parliament at such a critical time, is wholly hypocritical.\n\nThey are threatening legal action to prevent this happening, yet no such legal representation or protection appeared to be afforded to Sonia Khan (adviser to Sajid Javid) when Dominic Cummings forced her to hand over her office and private phones before frog marching her out of her office accompanied by armed police. I am looking forward, with relish, to the same treatment being meted out to Johnson, Cummings and whoever else makes up the vile cabal currently occupying Downing Street if they fail to comply.\n\nKate Hall\n\nLeeds", "description": "The TUC has called for legal measures to tackle discrimination based on class at work.
