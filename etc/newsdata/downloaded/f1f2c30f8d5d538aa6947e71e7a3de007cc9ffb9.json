Head coach Sean McVay told NFL Network's Michael Silver in June there was no doubt his quarterback would get a new deal:\n\n\"Whether it ends up happening this year or next year, there is a zero percent chance this guy's not gonna get an extension he's worthy of. All the narratives out there are wrong. Jared and I couldn't be more connected, and I couldn't be more appreciative of him as our leader. He is so vital and important to us and our success. That extension will get done. It's a matter of when, not if.\"\n\nThere wasn't a sense of urgency from the team since Goff was already under contract through 2020. The fifth-year option on his rookie deal was picked up in April 2019, guaranteeing him $27 million over the next two seasons.\n\nGoff's career is directly tied to McVay, especially because of the immediate and drastic improvement he made following a historically bad rookie campaign in 2016. Here's a comparison of his first year under Jeff Fisher with a Week 4 game in 2018 against the Minnesota Vikings:\n\nThe Rams have been among the most aggressive teams in the NFL when it comes to handing out contracts. They gave out lucrative long-term extensions to Aaron Donald (six years, $135 million), Brandin Cooks (five years, $81 million), Todd Gurley (four years, $57.5 million) and Rob Havenstein (four years, $32.5 million) prior to the 2018 season.\n\nThat strategy ultimately paid off with an NFC championship, but it did tie up a lot of cap space into those four players at a time when Goff's deal was coming due.\n\nCredit Rams general manager Les Snead for making it all work and keeping a competitive team that can be one of the best in the NFC for the foreseeable future.\n\nAn average season for Goff since 2017 is a 63.6 completion percentage with 4,246 yards and 30 touchdowns. Even with some perceived limitations to his game, it's hard to let a 24-year-old quarterback test free agency with that kind of performance.\n\nLos Angeles knows what it has in Goff. He's been a terrific fit in McVay's system and is still at an age at which he can keep getting better.", "description": "After much speculation, the  Los Angeles Rams  and quarterback Jared Goff have come to terms on a long-term contract extension...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/814/032/hi-res-38fee179d560bd8ddaff636d5d75d266_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75"}
