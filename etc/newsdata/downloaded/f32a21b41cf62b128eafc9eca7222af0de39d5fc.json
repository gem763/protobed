Trump\u2019s main points have been that the Fed is too hawkish, and the U.S. dollar is too strong.\n\nPolitics have made matters worse. But the Fed shows no interest in taking the more proactive approach to policy that Trump would like to help outflank China. Chinese authorities have not indicated that they will bend on U.S. trade demands. Trump cannot raise tariffs again without risking recession. Fiscal stimulus is unlikely.\n\nThe one lever left is the U.S. dollar.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut: A move by Trump to proactively de-value the U.S. dollar would be the monetary policy equivalent of the nuclear option, a weaponization that could set in motion an ugly currency war and a race to the bottom.\n\nAbsorbed by Trump\u2019s behavior, most commentary on this war has focused on the implications for Fed independence \u2014 not whether the president has a point. It turns out he did, at least last year.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell made a serious error, thinking the neutral rate was much higher. Markets shamed him into a dovish pivot by year end, but there has been little follow-through: Two small 25 basis point rate cuts, including the one announced September 18, and an end to balance sheet tightening. Powell also continued to pour cold water on expectations that short rates could be another 75 basis points lower by this time next year.\n\nTrump\u2019s frustration with Fed inertia boiled over into a late-August presidential tweet, howling at who was the bigger \u201cenemy\u201d: Powell or Chinese President Xi Jinping. The global manufacturing recession creeped into the U.S., and capital spending is contracting. Estimates are that 30 percent across-the-board tariffs on Chinese imports would be akin to a $2 per gallon increase in gasoline prices.\n\nThat\u2019s enough to push the U.S. economy into recession \u2014 and the president knows it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThus despite his many tweets \u2013 including claiming the Fed has \"no guts, no sense, no vision\" \u2013 Powell and the Fed Board are still not going to give Trump what he wants: Aggressive, reflationary monetary policy.\n\nA strong currency has been official U.S. policy for three decades. The benefits of being the de facto global currency are well known. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary reaffirmed the strong dollar policy.\n\nBut Trump is transaction-oriented, not beholden to taboos he believes do not serve his interests. He has been consistent in his criticism of how undervalued he considers the euro to be and was quick to target China as a currency manipulator on the recent drop in the renminbi.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s policy prescription is plain: Cut rates enough to steepen the yield curve. Borrowing conditions might not move much but the effect on the dollar could be significant. It is an epic historical anomaly that almost all the world\u2019s major countries\u2019 sovereign debt trades with a yield below the U.S. over-night risk free rate \u2014 a rate profile clearly helping to prop up the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe yield curve is ominous. Everyone, including the Fed Board, knows that the U.S. Treasury bond curve is an early but extremely reliable signal of building business risk. Yet the Fed\u2019s official view seems to be that the curve\u2019s inversion is a distortion arising from foreign policy settings: It is different this time and should be ignored. Powell said he will act \u201cas appropriate.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Powell will wait until the global slump leads to weakness in domestic indicators like spending and employment before he gets more aggressive. But by then, it may be too late. The Fed faces a complex situation, and Powell is moving in the right direction, albeit very slowly, certainly too slowly for Trump.\n\nCapital markets have reached critical levels. There is a lot of uncertainty in the world apart from trade discussions between the U.S. and China. Something must give.\n\nNo one expects a trade deal. The Chinese seem dug in and have prepared for difficult times. Trump has said the economic weakness associated with tariffs is a price worth paying to get to fair trade. The biggest surprise would be the announcement that both parties have come to terms.\n\nThis would take the pressure off Trump to resort to the nuclear option.\n\nFrancis A.
