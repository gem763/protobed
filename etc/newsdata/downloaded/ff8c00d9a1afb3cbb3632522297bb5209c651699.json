What this episode asks is, What if he did?\n\nI suspect many viewers have watched this season a little nervously, waiting for the moment when BoJack might be driven back to alcohol by a spasm of self-loathing, or a nerve-jangling encounter with someone he hurt in the past, or by the sheer weight of the temptation to pick up a bottle. In the past, a vitriolic rant like the one he received from Dr. Champ in the previous episode is exactly the kind of thing that might spark a relapse.\n\nBut after the events of last season \u2014 which saw BoJack hitting yet another low point in a lifetime full of low points \u2014 he really, genuinely seems committed to being better. The flaws are still there, but they\u2019re a lot less glaring, and he\u2019s better at tamping them down. And BoJack\u2019s recovery is aided by his decision to remove himself from the vapid, celebrity-worshipping side of Hollywoo that has always encouraged his worst habits and instincts.\n\nIn \u201cThe Face of Depression,\u201d BoJack actually remakes himself \u2014 trading his dyed-black mane for a shorter, grayer haircut, and swapping his usual jacket for something softer and more collegiate. If it wasn\u2019t clear from the previous episodes, BoJack really is changing: Doing his sincere best to atone for the sins of the past while piecing together a happier future.\n\nIn this episode, his soul-searching takes the form of a cross-country journey. Everyone he visits is someone he has hurt over the course of the series, and every trip includes an apology or an attempt to do something nice. In Los Angeles, he has a pleasant lunch with Todd, and actually shows real interest in Todd\u2019s life. When he runs into Sharona, the Horsin\u2019 Around hairdresser who was unjustly fired under his watch, he apologizes for his lack of courage in the past.\n\nAnd the farther he gets from Hollywoo, the better things seem to get. He stops by Chicago to see Diane, and goes to Connecticut to visit Hollyhock in college. It\u2019s there, alongside his half-sister-cum-surrogate-daughter, that BoJack also figures out a life that could mean something to him away from the Hollywoo grind. We\u2019ve seen BoJack explore different possibilities than being a Hollyoo celebrity before, from the drug-induced dream about the life he could have had with Charlotte to his ill-conceived return to an old Horseman family home in Michigan. But nothing has ever seemed as plausible or achievable as the possibility that he could become a drama professor at Wesleyan \u2014 all the way across the country from the mistakes he made in the past, coaching young actors with no panic about his own fading celebrity.\n\nYou can imagine \u201cBoJack moves to Connecticut to become a teacher\u201d being a wonderful (if not uncharacteristically optimistic) ending for the whole series. In fact, this episode is full of what could, theoretically, be happy endings \u2014 almost all of them sparked by BoJack\u2019s decision to live a newly generous and relatively selfless life. During his travels, BoJack realizes the woman who works at the airport Cinnabunny is asexual, and makes a possible love connection when he gets her to try Todd\u2019s asexual dating app. He gives Diane a supportive ear in the midst of her depression, and cleans her house on his way out the door. When he runs into Mr. Peanutbutter in Washington, D.C., he even good-naturedly improvises a version of the Horsin\u2019 Around/Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s House crossover that Mr. Peanutbutter has desperately wanted for decades.\n\nAnd when he heads into Old Town Horseberg, which seems to be the horse equivalent of Colonial Williamsburg, he seems more comfortable with himself and his past than we\u2019ve ever seen before: surrounded by horses, and reveling in the community around him instead of his own ego.\n\nI\u2019m not a total sucker. I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s still one more episode in the first half of BoJack Horseman\u2019s last season, and that everything being so good is almost certainly just a technique BoJack Horseman is using so it can twist the knife harder when everything gets so bad. And as good as it feels to see BoJack turn his life around, I can\u2019t honestly make the case that he deserves to escape the consequences for some of the awful choices he has made: his awful prom night with Penny, or his role in the death of Sarah Lynn (and the subsequent cover-up), or when he attacked Gina on the set of Philbert.\n\nAnd I\u2019m glad the show is handling those story lines with the proper weight instead of pretending they never happened so they can fast-track BoJack\u2019s redemption story. But there\u2019s also a part of me that wishes we could just leave BoJack Horseman in that old church in Horseberg, where BoJack can bask in the pleasant anonymity of the horses around him, and where the overarching message is \u201cpeace be with you.\u201d Does he deserve that kind of peace? Maybe not. But there\u2019s a part of me that wishes he could have it.\n\nHorsin\u2019 Around\n\n\u2022 In another uncharacteristically happy turn for BoJack Horseman, Princess Carolyn realizes that her old assistant Judah is the best person she could ever have in her corner, and hires him to be her new chief of operations.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m not entirely sure why, but I was particularly moved by the scene of BoJack happily taking a selfie in front of the U.S. Capitol. I think it\u2019s because we\u2019ve so rarely seen BoJack when he\u2019s not obsessively fixating on his public image, which might normally have prevented him from doing something so endearingly dorky and touristy. It also makes me wonder where, and to whom, he plans to text it.\n\n\u2022 Probably an ominous sign that the text on the top of the four faded Philbert posters spells, \u201cWHAT DID YOU DO?\u201d\n\n\u2022 A complete list of the BoJack-ified cities on the flight board: Albuturkey, NM; Baltimole, MD; Cowgary, AB; Dallas/Ft Woof; Ft. Laudersnail; Nashvole; Otterwa, ON; Fillydelphia, PA; Pittsbird, PA; Salt Lake Kitty, UT; San Crowse, CA; Secattle, WA; Vancougar, BC. (And maybe on that list: Chicago-O\u2019Hare and Phoenix, AZ.)\n\n\u2022 The sign posted outside Wesleyan University: \u201cA rich history of creativity, originality, and critical thinking. Also Michael Bay.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Pop-culture relics in the BoJack version of the Smithsonian: Lucy and Desi\u2019s divorce papers, Steve Urkel\u2019s clothes and glasses, and what I\u2019m pretty sure is the stuffed body of Eddie from Frasier.\n\n\u2022 Princess Carolyn and Lenny Turteltaub\u2019s coffee-shop cups read \u201cPeaches Carpenter\u201d and \u201cLeggy,\u201d respectively.\n\n\u2022 Princess Carolyn tells Ruthie a version of the Amelia Earhart story that ends with Earhart soaring off happily into the sun, echoing the apocryphal happy spin on Earhart\u2019s life that she saw in her favorite movie as a child.\n\n\u2022 Diane says Dawson\u2019s Creek got bad when she stopped using LiveJournal, and I know her sign at the end of the episode (jokingly) contends that it was always bad \u2014 but I would really love to hear which season and episode Diane would pinpoint as the beginning of the downward slide.\n\n\u2022 BoJack, bitterly complaining about Raven-Symon\u00e9 circling the Wesleyan teaching job he wants so badly: \u201cThat is so \u2026 like her.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Of course Mr. Peanutbutter and Joey Pogo\u2019s depression P.S.A. uses the Papyrus font.\n\n\u2022 Of course the fruit platter at the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting is nothing but honeydew.", "description": "BoJack\u2019s decision to live a newly generous and relatively selfless life sparks a series of theoretical happy endings.
