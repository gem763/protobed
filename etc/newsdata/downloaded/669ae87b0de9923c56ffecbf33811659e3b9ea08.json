It\u2019s best known for its Victorian cottages, fudge shops \u2014 and a firm ban on driving.\n\nAlthough residents can receive a temporary vehicle permit, and the police own at least one vehicle, residents and visitors traverse Mackinac on bicycles, snowmobiles or on foot. The only sitting President to visit the island, Gerald Ford, traveled by horse-drawn carriage.\n\nNow, Vice President Mike Pence is under fire for traveling in what might be the first motorcade in the island\u2019s history. This weekend Pence traveled via SUV, and was reportedly accompanied by seven other vehicles, to the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference.\n\nThe vehicle ban has been in place on the island for about 121 years.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Our #MackinacIsland has been a car-free haven forever, a piece of history frozen in time. Tell anyone from MI @VP just drove not 1 but 8 CARS on this island & watch their blood boil,\u201d wrote Julia Pulver, a former Michigan State Senate Candidate, on Twitter.\n\nMark Brewer, the former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, called the decision \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cunnecessary\u201d on Twitter.\n\nOthers pointed out that the Secret Service had likely decided to keep Pence inside the vehicle to ensure that the Vice President was safe.\n\n\u201cBeing from Michigan, the idea of cars on Mackinac Island makes me wince. But, I do recognize security issues like this may require them. Is there another way? Thoughts?\u201d wrote journalist Alicia Rancilio.\n\nThe island\u2019s village council banned all \u201chorseless carriages\u201d within the confines of Mackinac Island village on July 6 1898 due to concerns they would scare their horses.\n\nThe Mackinac Island State Park Commission adopted their own ban in 1901 after a \u201csummer cottager\u201d named Earl C. Anthony brought a vehicle onto the island. While the vehicle was driving in the park, a few horses were spooked and injured and several carriages were damaged.\n\nWrite to Tara Law at tara.law@time.com.", "description": "Vice President Michael Pence is under fire for traveling in what might be the first motorcade in Mackinac Island\u2019s history.", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/mike-pence-2.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
