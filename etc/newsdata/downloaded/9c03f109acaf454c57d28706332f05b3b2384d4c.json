But lesser infringements are marked as \u201cvisible to self\u201d, which leaves the content up but limits its distribution through TikTok\u2019s algorithmically-curated feed.\n\nQ&A What is TikTok? Show Hide TikTok is a video-sharing app which has become phenomenally popular with teenagers. Users film themselves in 15-second clips, typically set to music, and upload them to be viewed by followers and strangers alike. It has been the No 1 app on the worldwide App Store for five consecutive quarters, with an estimated 500 million users worldwide. Owned by Chinese startup ByteDance, the app as it is today is a merger of the original TikTok, which was launched internationally in September 2017, and the viral sensation Musical.ly. The latter had already become one of the most popular social media platforms for UK and US teenagers by the time it was purchased by ByteDance in November 2017. The merger meant TikTok ended up on the smartphones of more than 60 million users overnight. Bytedance has a valuation of $75bn (\u00a360bn), based primarily on the extraordinary growth of TikTok and its Chinese equivalent, Douyin. Lil Nas X found fame overnight when his track Old Town Road was used extensively on 15-second clips on the social network. That enthusiasm took the artist to a record-breaking run at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, Bytedance was fined a record $5.7m in the US for illegally collecting personal information from children under 13, and has been under investigation in the UK for how it handles the personal data of its young users, and whether it prioritises the safety of children on its social network. Alex Hern, UK technology editor\n\nThis latter enforcement technique means that it can be unclear to users whether they have posted infringing content, or if their post simply has not been deemed compelling enough to be shared widely by the notoriously unpredictable algorithm.\n\nThe bulk of the guidelines covering China are contained in a section governing \u201chate speech and religion\u201d.\n\nIn every case, they are placed in a context designed to make the rules seem general purpose, rather than specific exceptions. A ban on criticism of China\u2019s socialist system, for instance, comes under a general ban of \u201ccriticism/attack towards policies, social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, monarchy, parliamentary system, separation of powers, socialism system, etc\u201d.\n\nAnother ban covers \u201cdemonisation or distortion of local or other countries\u2019 history such as May 1998 riots of Indonesia, Cambodian genocide, Tiananmen Square incidents\u201d.\n\nA more general purpose rule bans \u201chighly controversial topics, such as separatism, religion sects conflicts, conflicts between ethnic groups, for instance exaggerating the Islamic sects conflicts, inciting the independence of Northern Ireland, Republic of Chechnya, Tibet and Taiwan and exaggerating the ethnic conflict between black and white\u201d.\n\nAll the above violations result in posts being marked \u201cvisible to self\u201d. But posts promoting Falun Gong are marked as a \u201cviolation\u201d, since the organisation is categorised as a \u201cgroup promoting suicide\u201d, alongside the Aum cult that used sarin to launch terrorist attacks on the Tokyo Metro in 1995 and \u201cMomo group\u201d, a hoax conspiracy that went viral earlier this year.\n\nFalun Gong has been suppressed by Beijing since 1999, but an incident in 2001 when five people self-immolated in Tiananmen Square has been used to justify moves against the group since.\n\nOfcom investigates CGTN over coverage of Hong Kong protests Read more\n\nOdd rules can be found elsewhere in the guidelines. The service\u2019s policies regarding what it describes as \u201cunderage pornography\u201d, for instance, explicitly detail four categories of underage users: an infant or toddler, under one year old; a child, 1-8 years old; an adolescent; and a minor, any person less than 18 years old. However, if it is \u201cunclear\u201d whether a user is under 18, the guidelines explicitly recommend that moderators \u201ctreat [the subject] as an adult\u201d.\n\nThe service also bans a specific list of 20 \u201cforeign leaders or sensitive figures\u201d includingKim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, Mahatma Gandhi, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Kim Jong-un, Shinzo Abe, Park Geun-Hee, Joko Widodo and Narendra Modi. Notably absent from the list is Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier.\n\nIn a statement, Bytedance said the version of the documents the Guardian has seen was retired in May, before the allegations of censorship in Hong Kong, and that the current guidelines do not reference specific countries or issues.\n\n\u201cIn TikTok\u2019s early days we took a blunt approach to minimising conflict on the platform, and our moderation guidelines allowed penalties to be given for things like content that promoted conflict, such as between religious sects or ethnic groups, spanning a number of regions around the world,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs TikTok began to take off globally last year, we recognised that this was not the correct approach, and began working to empower local teams that have a nuanced understanding of each market. As we\u2019ve grown we\u2019ve implemented this localised approach across everything from product, to team, to policy development.\n\n\u201cWe also understand the need to be more transparent in communicating the policies that we develop and enforce to maintain a safe and positive app environment. Users gravitate to TikTok because it provides an app experience that fosters their creativity, and we are committed to supporting that across our teams, product, policies, and the way in which we openly communicate with our community.\u201d\n\nThe service was launched in 2017, shortly before being merged with an American company, Musical.ly, that ByteDance purchased for a reported $1bn (\u00a3800m) in order to boost the growth of the app.\n\nA similar, China-only app, Douyin, launched in 2016, and grew to count one in 10 Chinese people as users by the end of 2017.\n\nTikTok was the most-downloaded item on the iOS App Store worldwide in the first half of 2018, and has remained hugely popular, particularly among its core user base of under-25s, ever since. But that popularity has been expensive: ByteDance has spent a reported $1bn on Facebook advertisements to keep growth high.", "description": "Leak spells out how social media app advances China\u2019s foreign policy aims", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8fa0e6ecbed2872389f1f40cb1508dfec463bb7/0_115_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7985e2c76be96b7443b30329056501a2", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
