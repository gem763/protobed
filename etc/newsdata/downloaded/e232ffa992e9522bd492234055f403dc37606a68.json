And while all of this was happening, Mr. Giuliani still served as a lawyer to clients with cases to plead before the Justice Department.\n\nIn distancing itself from Mr. Giuliani and trying to draw bright lines around how the Justice Department will and will not engage with him, the department has also undercut the perception that Mr. Giuliani can influence some of Washington\u2019s most important lawyers and decision makers. That could make it harder for Mr. Giuliani to represent clients who are under Justice Department scrutiny in the future.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly unusual statement from the Justice Department, which does not comment on ongoing investigations or even acknowledge them, and it\u2019s the kind of statement that would give clients pause about who is representing them,\u201d said Joyce Vance, a former federal prosecutor.\n\nMr. Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile the Southern District of New York has been investigating Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates \u2014 an inquiry that may be tied to a broader investigation of Mr. Giuliani himself \u2014 prosecutors there had not told Mr. Benczkowski of the Criminal Division of the case, as he does not oversee or supervise their work. The United States attorney\u2019s offices report to the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen .", "description": "In an unusual statement, a spokesman said department officials would not have met with President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer had they known his associates were under investigation.", "authors": ["Katie Benner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/us/20dc-giuliani/20dc-giuliani-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
