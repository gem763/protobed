Garden cress 2. Rocket 3. Tomato 4. Radish 5. Rye 6. Quinoa 7. Chives 8. Pea 9. Leek 10. Spinach - unsuccessful\n\n'An option is to use Lunar and Martian regolith.'\n\n\u2018These regoliths are not available for plant growth experiments, therefore NASA has developed regolith simulants.\u2019\n\n\u2018The major goal of this project was to cultivate and harvest crops on these Mars and Moon simulants.\u2019\n\nThe study examined ten different crop types: garden cress, rocket, tomato, radish, rye, quinoa, spinach, chives, pea, and leek.\n\nAnd the only one to fail was spinach.\n\nMoon regolith has been brought back to Earth, but we have yet to bring back soil from Mars, so the team used NASA\u2019s Mars simulated soils.\n\nThe soil was created with information about the red planet gathered by the Viking landers and the Mars Pathfinder rover.\n\nUsing simulated lunar and Martian regolith obtained from NASA mixed with some organic matter, the team were able to harvest the fruits of some crops, as well as their seeds -- some of which can be used to grow a new generation of crops. The team is hopeful that this study will help feed those who will one day call Mars home\n\n\u2018This simulant resembles the actual Mars regolith closely and originates from the Pu\u2019u Nene cinder cone located between Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea on Hawaii,\u2019 the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team was also curious if the harvest seeds would regrow to make new crops, as it would be an impractical the task to constantly launch seeds into space.\n\nBoth rye and cress seeds were able to germinate very well and radish showed around a 50 percent success rate.\n\nResearchers also discovered that the simulated Mars soil resembled similar characteristics to Earth\u2019s soil when it came to biomass production, but was significantly lower for the Moon soil.\n\nMoon (pictured) regolith has been brought back to Earth, but we have yet to bring back soil from Mars, so the team used NASA\u2019s Mars simulated soils in the study\n\n\u2018Fruits had never been harvested before on the Mars soil simulant or the Moon soil simulant, as far as we know,\u2019 the team wrote.\n\n\u2018Now that we have shown that adding organic matter to the simulants improves plant growth one of the next steps will be to find the optimal amount of organic matter to add.\u2019\n\n\u2018Several ratios should be tested. However, the more organic matter that is needed, the more difficult the first phase of building a \u2018soil\u2019 will be and the longer it will take.\u2019", "description": "Scientists found nine vegetables that can successfully grow on Mars including quinoa, radishes and tomatoes.
