Crilley, of Whitecrook, denies the charge.\n\nThe court heard that Dr Eason attended the call to go to the Crilleys' house while working as an out-of-hours GP.\n\nProsecutors say Crilley knew his wife (above) was suffering from injury and infection\n\nShe was allowed in by the accused who was 'well dressed and polite'.\n\nThe doctor said there was a clear smell when she entered the property and she found Mrs Crilley on the floor surrounded by nappies.\n\nDr Eason said: 'She was naked with one sock on her right foot. Her head was held up by pillows and she looked very ill. I couldn't make out what she was saying as her mouth was dry.\n\n'This was one of the worst cases I have seen in my career. My first thought was I need to get her to a hospital immediately.'\n\nThe doctor told jurors that it was difficult to examine Mrs Crilley due to her pain.\n\nShe said: 'Anytime I touched her, it was obvious that she recoiled and moaned.' Mrs Crilley was asked to go to hospital for treatment but she refused.\n\nDr Eason added: 'I thought she might die. I couldn't administer pain killers as I didn't know how bad she was.'\n\nCrilley told Dr Eason that his wife had fallen but did not say how long she had been lying on the floor.\n\nDr Eason believed that one of Mrs Crilley's legs was broken and she called an ambulance.\n\nCrilley also denies separate accusations of being threatening and abusive towards his wife and his sister-in-law Helen Jamieson.\n\nMrs Crilley's sisters told the court she wanted to leave her husband at one time, but she was too scared.\n\nHer sister Kathleen Friel, 58, added: 'She wasn't in touch with anyone and was in the house all the time.'\n\nProsecutor Richard Goddard, QC, asked her sister Margaret Colquhoun, 68, if their marriage was happy. She replied: 'No, she was too frightened.'\n\nMrs Friel blamed Crilley for not being able to visit her sister. She said: 'All the sisters went to visit her when she was in hospital.\n\n'I touched her head and Neil told a police officer to escort me out as he thought I messed her hair up.'", "description": "Neil Crilley, 77, of Clydebank, Dunbartonshire, went on trial at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday charged with the culpable homicide of his wife Maureen.", "authors": ["Connor Gordon For The Scottish Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/10/19581762-0-image-a-52_1570787906201.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
