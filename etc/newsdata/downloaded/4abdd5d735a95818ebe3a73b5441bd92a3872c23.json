REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\n(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) has agreed to purchase a software business from Toronto-based Pivot Technology Solutions Inc (PTG.TO) for $27 million, the U.S. chipmaker said on Tuesday.\n\nIntel said it would buy Smart Edge, a software that helps split up data and store it closer to users to make computing devices respond faster.\n\nThe software is designed to run on Intel\u2019s chips, which are best known as the heart of most personal computers but which the company is aiming to sell into equipment for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks that is being rolled out starting this year.\n\nAccording to Pivot\u2019s securities filings, Smart Edge did not generate significant revenue in the first six months of 2019, but made a loss of about $1 million before depreciation and amortization. Pivot, which has a market value of about $43 million, was issued a U.S. patent on Smart Edge\u2019s technology in July.\n\nIntel, which expects to close the Smart Edge deal in the fourth quarter, views 5G as a chance to expand its sales beyond personal computers and data centers, its two largest business segments.\n\nIn 5G networks, more data will be stored on computers scattered near cell towers and other network gear. Storing the data there, a practice called \u201cedge computing\u201d in the industry, is expected to help large files like videos show up more quickly on users\u2019 screens than if they were stored in centralized data centers.\n\n\u201cWe plan to take full advantage of our combined technologies and teams to accelerate the development of the edge computing market,\u201d Dan Rodriguez, a general manager of the network compute division in Intel\u2019s data center group, said in a statement.\n\nIntel\u2019s shares rose nearly 1% to $52.15 in morning trade, while of Pivot Technology stock gained 4.9% to C$0.70.", "description": "Intel Corp has agreed to purchase a software business from Toronto-based Pivot Technology Solutions Inc for $27 million, the U.S. chipmaker said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441113588&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E13H", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
