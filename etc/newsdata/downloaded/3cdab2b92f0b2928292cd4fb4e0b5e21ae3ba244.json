Donald Trump took a few moments to reflect on his public standing \u2013 which the president believes is amazing.\n\n\u201c[The impeachment process] is a scam. And the people are wise to it. And that\u2019s why my polls went up, I think they said, 17 points in the last two or three days. I\u2019ve never had that one. I\u2019ve never had that one.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s approach to polling has long been bizarre. It tends to involve the president picking a number he likes out of thin air, pretending it\u2019s real, and insisting that everyone accept the made-up number as accurate.\n\nBut this latest boast is uniquely ridiculous. A 17-point jump over the course of a few days is practically unheard of \u2013 the spike in George W. Bush\u2019s support in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 was a rare exception \u2013 and in Trump\u2019s case, it plainly does not exist in reality. Trump\u2019s support has actually fallen as his latest scandal has intensified.\n\nYes, it\u2019s theoretically possible that the White House has some internal polling that\u2019s telling the president what he wants to hear, but if a significant chunk of the American electorate were suddenly shifting in Trump\u2019s favor, there\u2019d be some indication of it in independent, public polling. No such evidence exists because the Republican made it up.\n\nMaking matters worse, real polls show public support for Trump\u2019s impeachment climbing, including a newly released Washington Post-Schar School survey, which found a 58% majority endorsing the impeachment inquiry against the president, while a 49% plurality support removing Trump from office. This is slightly worse than other recent data on the issue and suggests conditions for the president are getting worse, not better.\n\nCNN\u2019s Harry Enten explained late last week that support for Trump\u2019s impeachment is so high at this early stage that it\u2019s \u201chistorically unprecedented.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that the president believes \u201cthey\u201d have said his public support has climbed 17 points \u201cin the last two or three days.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Trump has persuaded himself into believing all sorts of nonsense, but there may be a larger significance to this one.\n\nConsider what Americans have seen from their president of late. As the pressure has increased, Trump has unraveled to an unsettling degree, talking up the idea of prosecuting members of Congress who say things he doesn\u2019t like, casually throwing around accusations of \u201ctreason,\u201d and raising the prospect of a \u201cCivil War-like fracture.\u201d\n\nBut as far as Trump is concerned, people are buying what he\u2019s selling. His public meltdown, in the president\u2019s mind, is a great success, which is being well received by nearly a fifth of the electorate. Trump sees a political landscape in which his popularity is tied to his antics: the more outlandish his posture, the more support he enjoys.\n\nNone of this is true, of course, but if the Republican has convinced himself that his claims are correct, it creates a dangerous set of incentives: Trump will be more inclined to act out if he believes Americans are responding favorably to his tantrums.\n\nI shudder to think what he may do next to give himself another imaginary 17-point bump.", "description": "Trump says his support has jumped 17 points in a few days.
