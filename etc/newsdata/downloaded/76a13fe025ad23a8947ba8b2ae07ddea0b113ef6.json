The campaign launched alongside Buffalo Wild Wings\u2019 \u201cFootball Game Day Menu,\u201d which offers fans discounted items such as $5 bar food and pitchers of beer starting today -- just in time for college TV games featuring top-ranked Clemson, #12 ranked Texas A&M and #14 Utah.\n\nFootball season is a critical period for Buffalo Wild Wings, which has struggled in recent years amid high chicken prices and declining customer traffic.
