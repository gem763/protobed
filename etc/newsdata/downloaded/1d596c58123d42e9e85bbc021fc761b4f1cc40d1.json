They remain some of the most profitable banks in the world, but their earnings fell last year after facing low credit growth and billions of dollars in remediation costs from wrongdoings exposed by the wide-ranging Royal Commission inquiry.\n\nThe ACCC is due to deliver its preliminary report by March 30 and a final report by Sept. 30, 2020.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said the government needs information on the banks\u2019 funding costs to understand why they are not passing on rate cuts in full, after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said those funding costs have dropped.\n\nThe RBA has cut the official cash rate by 0.25% three times so far this year to a record low of 0.75% in a bid to stimulate consumption and investment in a slowing economy.\n\nIn response, Australia\u2019s \u201cBig Four\u201d lenders - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ.AX), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX), National Australia Bank (NAB.AX) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) - have cut customer\u2019s mortgage rates by about 0.57%, on average.\n\n\u201cThe Australian people are sick of this merry dance where the RBA reduces rates, political leaders and the RBA themselves call on the banks to pass them on in full, and the banks ignore that advice,\u2019 Frydenberg said in parliament,\n\nFrydenberg says the investigation is needed to understand banks\u2019 pricing arrangements but has ruled out levying a tax or legislating banks to force them to pass on rate cuts in full.\n\nMARGIN PRESSURE\n\nA sustained ultra-low interest rates environment is weighing on bank\u2019s interest margins and analysts said bank earnings would drop if they were forced to pass on lower rates.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this will put more pressure on the banks to pass through a larger proportion of ... any further RBA movements,\u201d UBS analysts wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cThis would further exacerbate the net interest margin, return on equity and dividend pressure the banks are facing in an ultra-low rate environment.\u201d\n\nIn separate statements ,the big four banks said the inquiry was an opportunity to explain the challenges Australian banks are experiencing in a historically low interest rate environment.\n\nWestpac, the second largest lender, also defended the pricing decisions of the banks, saying they needed to manage the net interest margin \u2013 the difference between deposit and lending rates.\n\n\u201cAs part of this process we take into account the interest of borrowers, depositors and shareholders who provide the equity that enables us to operate,\u201d Westpac Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cBanks also need to make a reasonable level of return. This not only supports shareholder investment it also underpins prudential stability, and our debt rating.\u201d\n\nAnna Bligh, Chief Executive of lobby group the Australian Banking Association, said the inquiry should help highlight that some of the banks\u2019 funding sources have only small links to Australia\u2019s official rates.", "description": "The Australian government has ordered the competition watchdog to investigate why banks failed to fully pass on three official interest rate cuts this year, less than a year after a public inquiry exposed the industry for cheating customers.", "authors": ["Sonali Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
