(Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nPresident Trump said Saturday that he had canceled a previously undisclosed summit at Camp David with Taliban leadership and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani after the Taliban took responsibility for an attack last week that killed a U.S. soldier.\n\nTrump said the meetings had been set to take place Sunday.\n\nOn Twitter, the president appeared to cancel talks with the Taliban indefinitely, a significant blow to the peace process kicked off last year, which was nearing its conclusion.\n\nIn tweets Saturday evening, Trump wrote that he has \u201ccalled off peace negotiations\u201d and accused the Taliban of perpetrating the attacks to strengthen their negotiating hand.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey didn\u2019t, they only made it worse!\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIf they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?\u201d\n\nGhani had previously announced that he would travel to Washington. His trip had initially been planned for Saturday, but he delayed it for several days.\n\nFollowing the news, Ghani\u2019s spokesman said Sunday that his government appreciated Trump\u2019s announcement and that the cancellation of the bilateral talks should open the way for direct talks between Afghan officials and the insurgents.\n\n\u201cWe believe President Trump has a proper understanding of the situation and sees that the Taliban are not committed to peace,\u201d said the spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi. \u201cHe understands that the Afghan government and people are concerned for a meaningful and long-lasting peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Taliban must first stop the killing of Afghans and then it should talk directly to the Afghan government,\u201d Ghani\u2019s office said in a separate statement.\n\nThe canceled summit would have taken place just ahead of the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which led to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nThe White House declined to provide further comment on Saturday.\n\nNews of the Taliban\u2019s once-imminent arrival drew criticism from Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who serves in the National Guard. \u201cNever should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n[Afghans welcome Trump\u2019s cancellation of Taliban talks]\n\nIn his tweets, Trump appeared to reference a Thursday morning car bombing that killed two NATO service members, including one American, in a heavily fortified part of central Kabul. The Pentagon identified the soldier killed as Sgt. 1st Class Elis Angel Barreto Ortiz, a 34-year-old paratrooper from Morovis, Puerto Rico. He is the 16th American service member killed in combat in Afghanistan this year.\n\nThe attack, which killed a dozen in all, came just days after the top U.S. negotiator in the ongoing peace talks with the Taliban had announced that he had reached a deal \u201cin principle.\u201d It was part of a surge of Taliban violence in recent days in Kabul and elsewhere, leaving scores of people dead.\n\nFor their part, the Taliban has not issued any public response to Trump\u2019s comments, but a Taliban spokesman based in Qatar, where the talks have been held, sent out a tweet late Saturday night hinting at fatal problems.\n\n\u201cSo far there has not been a settlement of the inter-state talks. There may be numerous inter-Afghan talks in different countries,\u201d spokesman Sohail Shaheen tweeted. He also criticized attacks on the Taliban in Afghanistan\u2019s Uruzgan province. \u201cThere is enmity with the ongoing peace process.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear where Trump\u2019s abrupt move leaves the larger issue of an end to the longest American war or the return of U.S. forces. The secret summit would have been a step toward ratifying an agreement between the United States and the Taliban.\n\nThat deal, months in the making, largely had been handled by veteran diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad. Through painstaking negotiations, he worked to settle hostilities with the Taliban insurgency and prepare for an exit of all or most U.S. forces.\n\nHis work was expected to be ratified shortly.\n\nKhalilzad arrived in Kabul last week, after a final negotiating session with the Taliban, to brief Ghani\u2019s government on the terms of the agreement. Those terms included the withdrawal of more than 5,000 U.S. troops \u2014 more than one-third of the total in Afghanistan \u2014 in exchange for the Taliban agreeing to sever ties with al-Qaeda and to continue its fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThe deal also included a Taliban commitment to begin inter-Afghan talks with the Ghani government, expected to start within weeks. The talks themselves would include discussion of a cease-fire.\n\nTrump approved those terms when he met with Khalilzad and his top national security officials in late August. While national security adviser John Bolton was wary of the deal and argued that the Taliban could not be trusted, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others agreed that it would provide a good jump-start to an actual peace deal among the Afghan parties, allowing Trump to fulfill his campaign pledge of ending the war.\n\n[Afghanistan\u2019s Ghani to visit Washington as peace deal limps and violence surges]\n\nThe initial U.S. drawdown was to occur over a 135-day period, during which the United States and the Afghan government could monitor Taliban behavior and gauge the militant group\u2019s commitment to the deal.\n\nNo one was entirely happy with the terms.\n\nGhani argued behind the scenes that the process cut him out and left the U.S.-backed government in Kabul vulnerable.\n\nTrump was unhappy that the deal would initially leave about 8,500 troops in Afghanistan to prevent the country from once again becoming a haven for terrorism. Trump told confidants he felt frustrated that the proposed reduction under the draft deal would have taken force levels only back to where they were when Trump took office.\n\nOfficials also warned that the Taliban would step up their attacks in the days and weeks before it was signed, as both sides tried to improve their negotiating position for the upcoming inter-Afghan talks.\n\nThe attack Thursday was seen as part of that expected escalation. It deepened concern among Afghan officials that the proposed agreement does not offer enough assurance that civilians and security forces will be protected if U.S. troops withdraw.\n\nHowever, the hope has been that, once the inter-Afghan talks began, violence would gradually die down as the two sides discussed a broader cease-fire.\n\nThe Camp David meeting would have allowed Trump not only to claim credit for the negotiations, but also to put the president in place as the godfather of the actual signing of the document and the beginning of talks among the Afghans themselves.\n\nTrump \u2014 who had long advocated for a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan before he took office \u2014 has complained that American forces are little more than \u201cpolicemen\u201d in Afghanistan and has said that he would finally end the war.\n\nWhat remains unclear is why Trump waited until late Saturday \u2014 the day before the meeting at Camp David was to begin \u2014 to cancel talks over an attack the Taliban was clearly responsible for that was then three days old.\n\nAt the same time, the future of Khalilzad\u2019s negotiations remains uncertain, and it was not known whether Trump was canceling the peace deal altogether, or would use the incident to push for more Taliban concessions.\n\nAn official familiar with Khalilzad\u2019s efforts referred all questions to the White House for comment.\n\nPamela Constable in Kabul and Karen DeYoung in Washignton contributed to this report.", "description": "The abrupt disclosure appeared to deal a significant blow to the ongoing peace talks.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "Anne Gearan", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/I_IwUYL8kdh9NGT6mt1sl9lbhg8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VDXLENWRZQI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
