(Brynn Anderson)\n\nThe NFL\u2019s decision about whether to place New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown on paid administrative leave via the commissioner\u2019s exempt list remained pending Tuesday after league representatives met for 10 hours Monday with a woman accusing Brown of rape and sexual assault.\n\nMonday\u2019s lengthy meeting between the NFL and Britney Taylor was confirmed by a person familiar with the case, who said there was \u201cnothing imminent\u201d as of Tuesday afternoon on the league\u2019s decision about whether to place Brown on paid leave.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether that decision will be made this week. The person with knowledge of the deliberations said there is \u201cno timeline\u201d for the decision to be made because it depends on what the league\u2019s investigation finds.\n\n[Jenkins: I don\u2019t know what Antonio Brown did, but he\u2019s already damned by misogynist language]\n\nBrown made his Patriots debut in their win this past Sunday at Miami. The Patriots host the New York Jets this Sunday in Foxborough, Mass.\n\nThrough his attorney, Darren Heitner, Brown has denied the allegations made by Taylor in a lawsuit in Florida.\n\nSince Taylor filed her lawsuit, a second woman came forward claiming Brown committed sexual misconduct. In a Sports Illustrated report Monday, an artist who requested anonymity said Brown commissioned her to paint a mural at his house after meeting her at a charity auction to benefit the National Youth Foundation. While working at Brown\u2019s house, the artist said to Sports Illustrated, Brown crept behind her while naked except from a small towel covering his genitals. Brown has denied the allegations, through Heitner.\n\nIn a phone interview Tuesday, National Youth Foundation co-founder Sophia Hanson said the NFL has not contacted her or, to her knowledge, the artist regarding the accusations.\n\nBrown has not been charged with a crime. The league\u2019s personal conduct policy nevertheless authorizes NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to place Brown on paid leave if he believes following an investigation that Brown may have violated the conduct policy.\n\nIf Brown is placed on the exempt list, he would be paid by the Patriots but would be ineligible to practice with the team or attend games. He could appeal his placement on the list through the NFL Players Association. The list is designed to be used by the league until it makes a decision about whether to discipline a player under the personal conduct policy. Any suspension under the policy would be without pay.\n\nAdam Kilgore contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe NFL wanted a celebration for its 100th season.
