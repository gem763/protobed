While short on specifics, the German leader backed efforts to encourage consumers to buy more environmentally friendly products such as battery-powered cars fueled by renewable power.\n\n\u201cWe want to direct the behavior of people in a certain direction,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pricing of CO2 is the right way to make clear that all innovations should follow the goal of emitting less CO2. If we do this in a long-term and accountable way, there will be the incentives to move innovation in the right direction.\u201d\n\nVolkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG are facing tough times. Pollution concerns -- intensified by VW\u2019s 2015 diesel-cheating scandal -- have tarnished the industry\u2019s image and triggered massive investment in electric vehicles. Those costs had already started squeezing earnings when almost a decade of uninterrupted industry growth led by China came to a halt. The consequence is Germany\u2019s car production slumping to the lowest level since at least 2010.\n\nThe looming end of the combustion-engine era and the dramatically-increasing importance of digital technologies in cars, pose an unprecedented threat to the industry\u2019s traditional business model. A slew of profit warnings from manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler to parts makers like Continental AG provided fresh evidence that times have become rough.\n\nMerkel spoke after John Krafcik, the chief executive officer of Waymo. The Alphabet Inc. unit is widely regarded as the global leader in self-driving technology and represents a risk to the country\u2019s car brands, which are largely focused on motoring thrills. Krafcik offered a cooperative tone, even though German manufacturers are wary of allowing the Google parent access to sensitive customer data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about competing with car companies. It\u2019s to enable, not disrupt companies in the automotive space,\u201d said Krafcik. \u201cDeveloping self-driving technology takes a lot of time. There are no shortcuts. We can\u2019t do this on our own.\u201d\n\nGermany is teetering on the brink of recession, and the auto industry is pivotal to the economy\u2019s health. Carmakers such as Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW as well as parts suppliers like Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental employ about 830,000 people in the country and support everything from machine makers to advertising agencies and cleaning services.\n\nGermany\u2019s auto industry is trying to respond. Electric cars, such as the flashy Porsche Taycan and more affordable VW ID.3, dominated media presentations this week at the Frankfurt trade fair and more models are in the pipeline.\n\nDaimler CEO Ola Kallenius backed Merkel\u2019s CO2 pricing plan, saying at panel discussion in Frankfurt that there are costs related to fossil-fuels and it would make sense for a global plan to help fight climate change.\n\nFor the auto industry, any signs of support would be welcome. Demand for electric cars has been sluggish, and Merkel had to surrender her goal to have 1 million electric cars on German roads by 2020. Sales of hybrid and electric cars in the country last year totaled a mere 55,000 vehicles, or 1.6% of the market.\n\nIn addition to boosting efficient technologies, the country needs to accelerate the roll-out of charging stations to ease consumer concerns, she said.\n\n\u201cIf one believes that climate protection is a task for mankind, and I believe it is, then we must pay this price because otherwise we will have to pay a totally different price,\u201d Merkel said.\n\n(Adds comment from Daimler CEO in 10th paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Christoph Rauwald in Frankfurt at crauwald@bloomberg.net;Arne Delfs in Berlin at adelfs@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net, Chris Reiter, Raymond Colitt\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to help offset the higher costs of cleaner vehicles by putting a price on carbon-dioxide emissions, potentially offering a lift to Germany\u2019s vital auto industry as it grapples with the high-risk transition away from the combustion engine.Germany and its automakers", "authors": ["Christoph Rauwald", "Arne Delfs"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FXegwlnNj_B1z71W7wBnaQ--~B/aD03NTQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/3e2fc48fa2b435a7e7ab614fa2ddc4b6", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
