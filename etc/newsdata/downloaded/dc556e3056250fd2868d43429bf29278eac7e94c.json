Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenThe Hill's 12:30 Report: House panel approves impeachment powers Cruz: Texas will be 'hotly contested' in 2020 Senate Democrats want answers on 'dangerous' Amazon delivery system MORE (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersThe Hill's 12:30 Report: House panel approves impeachment powers Cruz: Texas will be 'hotly contested' in 2020 Sanders spokeswoman: A lot of candidates will have to answer for their past MORE (I-Vt.), cornering the two senators on health care, saying their \"Medicare for All\" plans would bankrupt the government and increase taxes on everyday Americans.\n\nThe former vice president even went as far as to call Sanders a \u201csocialist.\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s performance appeared considerably stronger than the past two Democratic debates, where Biden appeared to be slower to respond to attacks, and rarely went on the offensive. The former vice president was also not afraid to continue to tout and defend his record in the Obama administration, despite criticism from others on stage.\n\n\n\nWarren acts like a front-runner\n\n\n\nSen. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) remained quiet for large stretches of the debate \u2014 and that may not have been a bad thing.\n\n\n\nAs other candidates on stage argued over health care, immigration and, at one point, whether they should even be arguing, Warren was a calm, commanding presence that chimed in only when addressed by the moderators.\n\n\n\nUnlike Sanders, the other leading progressive on stage, Warren avoided much of the criticism from more moderate contenders, who repeatedly jabbed the Vermont senator over his Medicare for All proposal. And unlike Biden, her record and age remained untouched in the debate.\n\n\n\nIn short, Warren acted like a front-runner. She hovered above the fray and avoided taking damage from her rivals, and she did not pick any fights of her own.\n\n\n\nWhether her debate performance boosts her standing in the polls remains to be seen. But it\u2019s also unlikely to hurt her and may very strengthen her position as a front-runner.\n\n\n\nObama legacy comes to forefront\n\n\n\nFormer President Obama\u2019s legacy was brought up and debated frequently throughout the night. Biden continued to tout his ties to Obama, notably telling Warren in the beginning of the debate that she was for Bernie, and he was \u201cfor Barack\u201d on health care.\n\n\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro threw one of the most notable punches at Biden, accusing him of not fulfilling former President Obama\u2019s legacy on health care. The remark prompted Biden to say, \u201cThat\u2019ll be a surprise to him [Obama].\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden also faced questions on Obama\u2019s immigration record, which has been a target for progressives in the party. When pressed by moderator Jorge Ramos on whether the Obama administration made a mistake by carrying out mass deportations, Biden responded by saying, \"The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time\"\n\n\n\nThe July debates demonstrated that Obama\u2019s legacy proved to be a dividing point in the party, despite the former president\u2019s widespread popularity among Democrats.\n\n\n\nThursday\u2019s forum showed that Obama\u2019s legacy will continue to be questioned within the Democratic presidential primary.\n\n\n\nO'Rourke has a good night, but does it matter?\n\n\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) received praise for his performance on Thursday, in particular for his comments on gun control. He notably defended his mandatory assault weapons buyback proposal, saying, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\nO\u2019Rourke also continued to use the mass shooting in his home town of El Paso, Texas, last month to illustrate his personal connection to this issue, as well as to go after President Trump Donald John TrumpMexico says it disagrees with 'astonishing' Supreme Court decision allowing Trump asylum rule The Afghan negotiations \u2014 echoes from the past Democrats grill Army, Air Force nominees on military funding for border wall MORE. O\u2019Rourke has focused extensively on gun control since the attacks, and his overall response to the mass shooting last month earned him the praise of a number of his opponents on stage, including Biden and Harris.\n\n\n\nHowever, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s recent singular focus on gun control and combatting racism does not appear to have helped him gain traction in the polls. A CNN poll released on Wednesday showed the former congressman at just 5 percent support among voters.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, former Rep. Eric Swalwell Eric Michael SwalwellThe Memo: Democratic field boils down to four-horse race If the Democratic debates were pro wrestling, de Blasio is comic relief Inslee seeking third term as governor after ending presidential bid MORE (D-Calif.) and Washington Gov.
