I was worried about coming out \u2013 that\u2019s the last thing I remember\u2019.\n\nPolice at the scene following the incident at Hull Fair on October 7 (Picture: MEN)\n\n\u2018We must have been half way through the ride, it was bouncing a lot, spinning us around, it was okay, but then the actual carriage position of it changed, so all our weight was facing forwards onto the bar. My body was being pushed forwards and into the barrier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It started to bounce and that\u2019s when remember it tilting \u2013 I was worried about coming out but that\u2019s the last thing I remember thinking.\n\nI'm a minister who got arrested for taking part in Extinction Rebellion protests\n\n\u2018I remember the sensation of falling out, but I don\u2019t remember what I was thinking. There wasn\u2019t a period where I thought the barrier was coming loose, it just happened all at once.\n\n\u2018I just remember seeing silver, as if it was the floor, I would have said I fell out and dropped straight to the ground below, I didn\u2019t know I had been flown through the air like a ragdoll until my mum told me in hospital.\u2019\n\nJade says she woke up, surrounded by strangers and at first she thought she was in a dream.\n\n\u2018I just remember being laid there and looking in the sky, and I could see the Star Flyer ride, she said.\n\nEven after the accident, the ride continued spinning (Picture: MEN)\n\n\u2018People have said I looked like I was dead, with my eyes open. I thought it was a dream, I gave it a minute and then realised it wasn\u2019t a dream and that\u2019s when I started to panic and people were telling me not to move.\n\n\u2018I thought I\u2019d lost all of my teeth, my mouth felt like it had been scrambled.\n\nTeacher told Jewish children, 10, they'd be 'sent to the gas chambers' for misbehaving\n\n\u2018I could see my friend, I could hear people saying \u2018how old is she?\u2019 And asking him questions about me \u2013 I was trying to speak but because of what had happened, my mouth was full of blood.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018I feel angry as nobody should go to a fair and be thrown from a ride. It is disgusting really and when I think about how it happened it makes me angry that the that the safety systems simply didn\u2019t do their job.\n\n\u2018I feel lucky to be alive, or to have come away from this without a brain or spinal injury which would have left me paralysed for life, so I do feel lucky in a way.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve tried not to think too much about what could have happened to me. What I have thought about a lot is how really small children are allowed to go on these fast rides at the fair, and how dangerous they are.\n\n\u2018My little sister is nine years old and I\u2019d hate to think of this happening to her. I\u2019m angry this could have happened to my little sister, it could have happened to a child, and they might not have been as fortunate as me.\u2019\n\nJade concluded: \u2018My face is still really swollen, I can\u2019t smile, it worries me that my mouth will never feel the same again, I also have a big gash on my chin which was sewn up in surgery.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve gone through a mixture of emotions, sometimes I\u2019m really low and upset, if I have a bad day, I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone, I feel like I wont ever be the same person again, I\u2019ll be anxious to do everything.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has instructed Hudgell Solicitors to act on her part as she tries to get answers about what happened .\n\nInjury claims specialist Becci Ashfield said: \u2018This is quite simply something which should never happen and a full and transparent investigation is now needed to bring answers as to how and why Jade came to be thrown from the ride and suffer her injuries.\n\n\u2018It is also vital that lessons are learned to avoid similar incidents happening again. That is vital for the confidence of the many thousands \u2013 of all ages \u2013 who attend fairs like this up and down the country and should be able to do so in the knowledge that they are completely safe on all rides.\n\nHull Fair bosses said people had more chance of being \u2018struck by lightning in Sainsbury\u2019s\u2019 than being thrown off a ride.\n\nGarry Leach, who is chairman of the Showmen\u2019s Guild, says ride operators are \u2018devastated\u2019 by what happened on the Airmaxx 360 and that they were doing all they could to assist the Health and Safety Executive, which is leading the investigation.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
