That is a decision that you take, and no one can give you a deadline.\n\n\u201cYou are the ones who moved the cabinet, and your movement, to be honest, is what led to the decision that you see today.\u201d\n\nProtesters responded with chants of \u201cthieves, thieves!\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re not leaving the streets\u201d, and called the reforms \u201cproof\u201d that the country\u2019s leaders had for decades been \u201crobbing them blind\u201d.", "description": "Protesters in Lebanon rejected sweeping economic reforms announced by the government on Monday, saying they would not go home until the entire cabinet resigned.", "authors": ["Josie Ensor", "Joseph Haboush", "Rosa Prince", "Tom Harris", "Stephen Pollard"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/21/TELEMMGLPICT000213661620-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-LJS7LKjeK9Zr8QxHnNHG4itpGhsZrUs3owZAjQ2uWw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
