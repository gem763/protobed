Essential for seasoning your food to perfection, whether that\u2019s while rustling up a meal, or sitting at the dining table.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s really no need to spend a fortune and you can expect a good quality set to last many years, with some in our round-up even coming with a lifetime guarantee.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t considered this before, but as well as grinding tough black peppercorns and rough sea salt, many of the sturdy mills with good quality mechanisms are also capable of crushing whole spices too \u2013 a handy kitchen hack we\u2019re happy to have discovered.\n\nPersonally, we prefer a grinder that dispenses the fruits of its labour from the top, that way kitchen mess is kept to a minimum, however, some of these clever contraptions even come with their own pretty plate, so whatever your preference, there\u2019s an option for that.\n\nAnd if grinding by hand sounds like too much effort, we\u2019ve even included a battery-powered option, which will dispense freshly ground seasoning at the touch of a button.\n\nAt the other end of the gadget spectrum is a simple salt and pepper shaker, if you don\u2019t require freshly ground condiments.\n\nAnother thing to consider before selecting your mills is where your set will be kept when not in use. Do you want a stylish pair, worthy of keeping out on display? Or would you rather something small and compact that will stay tucked away in a cupboard until you need it.\n\nWhen testing we were looking for user-friendly sizes, easy to fill contraptions that looked chic at the same time.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.
