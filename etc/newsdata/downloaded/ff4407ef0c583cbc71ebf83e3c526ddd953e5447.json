A public hearing is scheduled Nov. 6.\n\nOfficials say they\u2019re trying to stem complaints and compel street-dwellers to seek help as part of a broader strategy to protect the homeless and the public, safeguard business interests and address a public health crisis.\n\n\u201cI look at this as an effort of desperation, really, to try to figure out how to manage a situation that is almost unmanageable,\u201d said Councilman Brian Knudsen. \u201cThe city\u2019s (already) taking really proactive steps, but it\u2019s not enough, and it\u2019s not fast enough.\u201d\n\nOutside his downtown office, attorney Gerald Gillock said he often finds hypodermic needles, trash and the stench of urine and feces. Once, he scooped poop in a shovel and walked it over to City Hall to get officials\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to the bathroom everywhere,\u201d Gillock told the Review-Journal. \u201cI had that happen 10 times in two weeks.\u201d\n\nBut Gillock doesn\u2019t think a camping ban is the solution. He said shelters are already at capacity and the ordinance wouldn\u2019t require the city to provide public sanitation facilities.\n\nCity Council members agree there is a need to address what is widely seen as a worsening regional problem.\n\nMayor Carolyn Goodman and two other council members say they support the camping ban.\n\n\u201cThis ordinance is not to put folks in jail,\u201d said Councilwoman Victoria Seaman, who noted that the city\u2019s downtown Courtyard Homeless Resource Center offers much-needed assistance. \u201cIt\u2019s to help them get them where they need to go and not have the encroachment upon businesses where you have folks sleeping in doorways.\u201d\n\nKnudsen, Councilman Stavros Anthony and Councilwoman Olivia Diaz, whose Ward 3 district includes the heart of downtown Las Vegas, said they haven\u2019t decided whether they support the measure.\n\nMeanwhile, the proposal has drawn protests, questions of legality and criticism that it will only criminalize the destitute and vulnerable.\n\nCity Attorney Brad Jerbic said he believes the law would hold up in court. He said he\u2019ll present the council with information about complete or partial camping bans in 10 other jurisdictions.\n\nJerbic said he intentionally drafted the measure to include \u201cif beds are available\u201d language to avoid the fate of a similar camping ban in Boise, Idaho, that was struck down last year by a federal court.\n\nThat case could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco deemed the Boise measure unconstitutionally cruel and unusual because it didn\u2019t guarantee enough shelter beds were available.\n\nEric Tars, legal director of the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty, who worked on the Boise case on behalf of six homeless individuals, said the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which handles cases in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia and part of Maryland, and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Florida have issued similar rulings.\n\nTars argued the Las Vegas ordinance could saddle the homeless with arrest records and tickets they can\u2019t pay, keep them from getting jobs and housing, and possibly lead to the loss of lifeline government benefits.\n\nRather than try to thread what he called a \u201cconstitutional loophole,\u201d Tars said Las Vegas could follow other cities that use temporarily vacant spaces as shelters, rotate shelters among different churches, allow residents to put tiny homes in backyards or provide safe parking options for people living in vehicles.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just exile people you don\u2019t want to see in your downtowns,\u201d he said.\n\nFor some, living downtown amid a cluster of shelters and food kitchens in what officials call the Corridor of Hope is a monotonous routine.\n\nBy 6 p.m. one Wednesday, hundreds of men had lined up for a bed at Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada, where all 500 beds were filled.\n\nOthers waited for dinner and a bed at the over-capacity Las Vegas Rescue Mission, where 191 stayed overnight. Some slept on cots and couches.\n\nAt the Salvation Army, the 104 walk-in beds for men and women were claimed by 7 p.m. the night before.\n\nAll told, there are about 2,000 beds for more than 5,500 homeless people on the streets on any given night in southern Nevada, according to this year\u2019s annual homeless census taken in January.\n\nClark County estimates that more than 14,000 people are homeless at some point during the year.\n\nJerbic said a plan to address the bed shortage will be unveiled when the camping ban is discussed Nov. 6. He declined to provide details.\n\n\u201cWe do have plans to always have a certain number of beds available just for this reason,\u201d he said. \u201cThey won\u2019t be available on a daily basis except when needed for this ordinance.\u201d\n\nThe city has said no one will be turned away at an open-air, 24/7 courtyard where officials say more than 300 people stay on any given night. There are 220 sleeping mats.\n\nEven if there were beds available, Deacon Tom Roberts, chief executive of Catholic Charities, worried that if people on the streets are forced to seek shelter, they will avoid resources and Las Vegas police outreach officers. He said more resources should be put toward mental health and addiction treatment.\n\n\u201cYou can arrest people all day long, and, frankly, you can put them in an apartment. But if you can\u2019t treat the reason why they\u2019re there, the apartment will become an insane asylum,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cEven if we had an open bed, I can\u2019t put someone upstairs in our dorm environment who doesn\u2019t want to be there. That creates a safety risk.\u201d\n\nDealing with homeless mentally ill or drug-addicted people is not covered by the proposed ordinance. That is another dividing line in the debate.\n\nDiaz, one of the undecided council members, has suggested using court diversion programs for homeless individuals in need of addiction and mental health treatment or housing.\n\nIn an interview with KNPR public radio this month, Goodman resurrected an idea her husband, Oscar Goodman, championed when he was mayor.\n\nIt would turn a shuttered former state prison 30 miles south of Las Vegas into a facility for people with severe mental illness.\n\nOn the street level, police Lt. Tim Hatchett said he doesn\u2019t foresee the ordinance would be an undue burden on his homeless outreach team or patrol officers who regularly interact with the homeless.\n\n\u201cWe always have the capability of determining what we\u2019re going to enforce, right?\u201d said Hatchett, who has a background in social work. He noted that officers who stop motorists for speeding may issue a warning instead of a ticket.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019ve done everything you possibly can for this person, you have to have something to say: \u2018OK, it\u2019s time for you to get some help, right?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nAnthony, the councilman and former Las Vegas police captain, said law enforcers including city marshals must commit to the new rule, and the city must have a system in place to alert officers about bed availability.\n\nHatchett said officers already communicate with shelters on a daily basis.\n\nLess clear is whether the homeless would adapt to the law.\n\nAnthony Lowe, who has stayed at the Salvation Army shelter since March, said he has to choose between waiting in line for a bed or making an uphill trip to a food shelter more than a mile away. Arthritis in his feet makes it difficult for the 64-year-old to walk, he said.\n\nKathleen Sutton, a 58-year-old disabled former investigator for a pharmaceutical company, uses a motorized scooter and has lived on the streets since June. She said she believed a camping ban could add more instability to her already precarious existence.\n\nSutton said she has been sexually assaulted, watched a man get run over in a nearby desert lot and tried several ways to get help. She said she\u2019s number 841 on a waiting list for affordable housing.\n\nHer support network includes Pate, Reynolds and an 86-year-old homeless Korean War veteran they all call \u201cdad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a tough girl, but I\u2019m scared being by myself,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cWhere do the homeless go? The marshals come in. They ask you to get off the street. Where do you go? Down the street, until we get woken up again? So where do we go?\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Las Vegas Review-Journal, http://www.lvrj.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At a street corner in downtown in Las Vegas, a barefoot woman whispers to herself.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Briana Erickson", "Shea Johnson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/25/exchange-homeless_camping_ban-vegas_16417_c0-167-4000-2500_s1200x700.jpg?309b4467e1f3a2a8ff765db9a91ebeb327dbd582", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
