Watching her being submerged in the water and be prodded with needles like a pin cushion is something no parent wants to see.\n\n\"It was so hard knowing there was nothing we could do.\u201d\n\nDespite the bleak initial outlook, Holly has made a remarkable recovery.\n\nLittle Holly has made an incredible recovery.
