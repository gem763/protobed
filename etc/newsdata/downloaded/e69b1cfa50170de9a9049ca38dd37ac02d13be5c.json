Investors can no longer fool themselves into thinking that the US can escape the global slowdown. After learning that contracted at its fastest pace in 10 years, ISM reported the weakest service-sector activity index since 2016. American businesses are feeling the pain of the slowdown of the economy and the trade war. Unfortunately even with central banks easing monetary policy across the globe, the slowdown will deepen so investors are looking beyond Friday\u2019s report to the later this month and the potential for action.\n\nA number as weak as Thursday\u2019s ISM should drive the , Treasury yields and stocks lower across the board. We got a glimpse of that on Tuesday and Wednesday when stocks fell more than 800 points following disappointments in and manufacturing data. The US dollar also dropped but we saw more restrained selling Thursday even though non-manufacturing ISM is a more significant release. All of this tells us that investors are bracing for a weak jobs number and investors are all but certain that the Fed will be forced to lower again this year.\n\nFed fund futures are pricing in 87% on October 30 and a 96% chance of a cut by December 11. This outlook is far more aggressive than most policymakers may be prepared for. When the central bank cut rates in September, 2 members voted for no change and the majority did not expect additional easing this year. The question now is whether this month\u2019s reports will change so many views. While manufacturing was slowing for most of the year, services perked up enough in August for Fed Chairman Powell to say that he expects the economy to remain strong. Investors on the other hand sent the tumbling lower because they believe that these reports will force the central bank to ease for the third time this year.\n\nDollar bears will be looking for validation from nonfarm payrolls and while economists predict slightly higher job growth, investors are bracing for another ugly report. The arguments favor a weak release. Hiring in the service sector was at a standstill while the manufacturing sector shed jobs at the fastest pace in 5 years according to ISM. ADP also reported weaker private payroll additions, which explains the collapse in the Conference Board\u2019s index. The drop in reported by Challenger and the improvement in the won\u2019t be enough to offset the deterioration in other reports. is also expected to slow and we would not be surprised if the ticked higher.\n\nPositioning for a weak jobs report could pay off but given the this report typically induces, exposure should be limited. If payroll growth is less than 140K and growth slows to 0.2%, we could see a more durable decline in the that takes below 106. However if there\u2019s anything in the jobs number that could cast doubt on another round of easing, the dollar will squeeze sharply higher. Stocks on the other hand could react favorably to a positive and negative number if investors immediately think that additional easing will be necessary.\n\nLeading Indicators For Nonfarm Payrolls\n\nArguments for Stronger Payrolls\n\n1.
