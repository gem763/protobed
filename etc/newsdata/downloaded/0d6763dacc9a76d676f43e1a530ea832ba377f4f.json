That would extend import taxes to virtually everything China ships to the United States. China has hit back by targeting about $120 billion in U.S. goods, focusing on farm products.\n\nThe high cost of the tariffs and uncertainty over when and how the trade war will end have taken an economic toll, especially on manufacturing companies. A private survey last week found that U.S. factory output had dropped to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was in the grips of a deep recession.\n\nLiu met Thursday with leaders of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-China Business Council. Liu told them the Chinese negotiators \u201ccome with great sincerity\u201d and were ready to discuss the trade balance, market access and investor protection, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nThe report made no mention of willingness to discuss Chinese industrial and technology policy, a major irritant that sparked the tariff war.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether that was intended to signal Beijing was digging in on resisting pressure to roll back plans for government-led development of global competitors in robotics, electric cars and other technology. Washington, Europe and other trading partners complain those violate China\u2019s market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over business secrets.\n\n\u201cBoth sides have been losing, and so has the global economy,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nBrilliant, who spoke with both delegations, sounded optimistic about the chances of progress, noting that Beijing has stepped up purchases of U.S. soybeans in a goodwill gesture. He said he hoped a productive meeting would persuade the Trump administration to call off or postpone plans next Tuesday to raise tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports from 25% to 30%.\n\n\u201cWe all know we can\u2019t afford a further escalation of the trade war,\u201d Brilliant said.\n\nStill, Beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy Washington. Doing so likely would require scaling back the Chinese leaders\u2019 aspirations to technological competitiveness they see as crucial to their country\u2019s future prosperity.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Darlene Superville and Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Donald Trump offered an upbeat assessment of U.S.-China trade talks and said he would meet at the White House on Friday with the leader of the Chinese negotiating team.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Wiseman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/us_china_trade_74152_c0-368-4800-3168_s1200x700.jpg?732478351be3f2740ae51011503eaaf52c0188cc", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
