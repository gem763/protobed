There\u2019s also a ruinously expensive nuclear power plant currently being built in Somerset by the name of Hinkley Point C.\n\nFrench energy company EDF, which is leading the project to construct what was intended as the first of a new generation of nuclear power plants, has just warned that the cost of building the thing is set to come in much higher than it had originally estimated.\n\nAt the upper end, the figure has been increased by \u00a32.9bn to \u00a322.5bn. With these big infrastructure projects, it always pays to go with the worst-case scenario and then to add a couple of billion to it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut before you start looking at your tax return and wondering how much of it will go into this thing as a result of the announcement, you can rest easy(ish). At least for the moment. It is the developers that will have to find the extra cash.\n\nIt bears repeating that EDF\u2019s former finance director Thomas Piquemal resigned rather than put his name to a project that he reportedly feared would muck up the group\u2019s numbers. That looks like a smart move.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Business news: In pictures Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nThe attraction to the company, which spent a long time dithering, and its partners was the guaranteed price for Hinkley\u2019s power the government agreed to on our behalf. It\u2019s good for 35 years regardless of what happens to wholesale prices over that time.\n\nIt looks like a sweet deal when you consider what\u2019s been happening with them. The cost of energy from offshore wind has, for example, fallen to a record low and no longer requires any sort of subsidy, or guaranteed price, to make it pay for all concerned.\n\nIt just looks a lot less sweet every time there\u2019s an announcement talking about \u201ccost increases\u201d as a result of \u201cchallenging ground conditions that made earthworks more expensive than anticipated\u201d and \u201crevised action plan targets and extra costs needed to implement the completed functional design, which has been adapted for a first-of-a-kind application in the UK context\u201d.\n\nBleurgh. Given the money that was spent researching this thing, you wonder how it is that someone didn\u2019t flag up those \u201cground conditions\u201d, but that\u2019s by the by.\n\nCritics always feared that the developers might at some point end up going cap in hand to the taxpayer. This latest announcement will keep those concerns front and centre. It surely ought to lead to some nail-biting at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and maybe at the Treasury too.\n\nWhat happens if there\u2019s another one of these revised estimates and then another?\n\nEDF is currently in talks with the French government, its partial owner, about a restructuring that would see the nuclear part of the business fully nationalised. That adds a potentially interesting wrinkle to this. If things start to get really sticky at Hinkley, who pays? French taxpayers or British ones?\n\nProblems of one kind or another have beset all of the potential sites for sister plants. They\u2019re years away. What keeps the show on the road, however, is a deep attachment to the nuclear programme in parts of the government, despite the difficulties in justifying it on economic grounds.\n\nIt\u2019s just not a good look to have this announcement coming so shortly after the one about the price of offshore wind.\n\nMay dithered a bit over Hinkley but ultimately went ahead. With the earth now moving, we\u2019re pretty much stuck with it.\n\nThere really is no need, however, to make this white elephant part of a herd.", "description": "*/ Brexit is far from the only polluting legacy left to the country by David Cameron and Theresa May.
