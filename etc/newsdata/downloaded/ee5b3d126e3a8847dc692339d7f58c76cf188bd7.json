As per The New York Times, \u201cSince 2008, he has been an Army foreign area officer\u2014an expert in political-military operations\u2014specializing in Eurasia. Colonel Vindman has a master\u2019s degree from Harvard in Russian, Eastern Europe, and Central Asian Studies. He has served in the United States\u2019 embassies in Kiev, Ukraine, and in Moscow, and was the officer specializing in Russia for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before joining the National Security Council in 2018.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough to protect Vindman from a vicious smear campaign\u2014and one that touched on a classic anti-Semitic trope\u2014ahead of his closed-door testimony, in his dress uniform, before the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday. Vindman\u2019s\u2019 opening statement, released beforehand, made clear his account would line up with the whistleblower account of Trump demanding a probe of the Biden\u2019s if Ukraine ever wanted to see the military aid the U.S. had already committed to providing.", "description": "The attackers believe in single loyalty: Either you\u2019re with Trump or you\u2019re against America.", "authors": ["Dean Obeidallah"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572371772/191029-Dean_O-republicans-loyalty-tease_esmtvi", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
