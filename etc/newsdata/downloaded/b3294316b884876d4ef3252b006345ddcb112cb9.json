I was staying with my mum in London and her bedroom is on the ground floor.\n\n\u2018I always find it really hot in the room, so she opened the window for me.\n\n\u2018I was sound sleep, it was pitch dark and I woke up with this pain.\n\n\u2018I realised something was at my face. I felt this thing on my lip.\n\n\u2018I grabbed its jaws and prised it apart. It was all a blur but I had this feeling of yanking on my lips.\n\n\u2018It was like opening a clamp. Its teeth were locked on my lower lip.\n\n\u2018I stood up and the fox jumped down, and I left the room just screaming.\u2019\n\nThe fox attacked Jill as she was sleeping in the ground floor bedroom (File picture: Rex)\n\nThe fox sneaked into the ground floor bedroom through this window\n\nDisturbingly, Jill said her mother returned to the bedroom last night and the \u2018large\u2019 fox was at the window staring inside.\n\nShe said her mother believes the fox \u2018has a taste of blood\u2019 and is calling on the council to launch a \u2018cull\u2019 before the fox strikes again.\n\nShe added: \u2018My mouth is a mess and I\u2019m going to be left with a scar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I just thought if this was my mum who is 82 or a child in a cot, they would not have been able to fight it off.\n\n\u2018They would have been mauled. Foxes are not meant to touch people. Apparently if you show fear they might be aggressive, but I was sleeping. I was sound asleep.\n\nThe fox escaped and made off in the direction of Willesden Cemetery (Picture: Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a strong 53-year-old but there\u2019s no way my mum would have been able to prise the fox\u2019s jaws open like I had.\u2019\n\nJill claims Brent Council told her \u2018there\u2019s nothing they can do\u2019 which she said is \u2018ridiculous\u2019.\n\nShe added: \u2018They just need culled but they\u2019re protected so that\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019\n\nA council spokesperson said: \u2018We\u2019re sorry to hear about this incident. We have no statutory powers to deal with foxes, which are classed as a protected species.\n\n\u2018Fortunately fox attacks are very rare and the animals usually only become aggressive when they find themselves trapped.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
