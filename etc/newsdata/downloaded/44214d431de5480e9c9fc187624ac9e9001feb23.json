Bewildered TV analysts also ridiculed the Giants for reaching for Jones at No. 6 rather than waiting to nab him with a later pick. Even fellow quarterback prospect Dwayne Haskins fanned the flames when TV cameras caught him snickering in disbelief after Jones went ahead of him.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cThe city of New York went absolutely bonkers because they wanted somebody else and they didn\u2019t want him,\u201d said Jones\u2019 former high school coach, Larry McNulty, who was with the quarterback on draft night. \u201cIt bothered me a lot. I was mad. I was like, at least give the kid a chance.\u201d\n\nThe same New York fans who panned the selection of Jones on draft night now are itching to anoint him as Eli Manning\u2019s successor just five months later. The rookie followed up a strong preseason with a brilliant performance on Sunday in his NFL debut, throwing a pair of touchdowns and running for two more to spearhead the Giants\u2019 rousing comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most remarkable aspect of Jones\u2019 sudden transformation from maligned draft pick to rookie savior is how he handled that initial barrage of post-draft criticism. The unflappable 22-year-old didn\u2019t allow the rampant negativity to crush his spirit and sink him, nor did he let the quest to prove his critics wrong leave him bitter and resentful.\n\nAsk Jones\u2019 father when he realized his son would be able to withstand the vitriol aimed at him, and Steve Jones will point to a comment his son made last spring at the height of the clamor. Daniel Jones insisted that he knew who he was, that he was confident in his own ability and that he didn\u2019t intend to waste time worrying about what others thought of him.\n\n\"What his comments said to me was that he was grounded enough to do this without letting all that affect him,\" the elder Jones said. \"He seems to have a pretty good understanding of when and how much of what everyone else is saying he needs to concern himself with \u2014 and how to keep that from getting in the way of what he needs to do.\"\n\nIf Jones goes on to enjoy a successful career with the Giants, he won\u2019t be the first quarterback to survive a rude draft-night welcome. Boos cascaded down on Donovan McNabb in 1999 from angry Philadelphia Eagles fans who expected their team to select Ricky Williams. Twenty years earlier, baffled Giants fans responded similarly after their team chose a little-known Morehead State quarterback named Phil Simms.\n\nDuke quarterback Daniel Jones is selected with the sixth pick by the New York Giants during the first round of the 2019 NFL draft. (Getty Images)\n\nThe beginning for Daniel Jones\n\nThe obstacles Jones overcame earlier in his football career prepared him unusually well to follow the example set by McNabb and Simms. Brushing off catcalls on draft night is nothing compared to being told you\u2019re too small to play quarterback in high school or not good enough to land a scholarship to a major college.\n\nAs a high school freshman, Jones stood 5-foot-10 and weighed only 135 pounds, not exactly the ideal physique for a quarterback. Basketball appeared to be the sport in which he had the most promise until the young point guard had a change of heart early in his high school career.\n\nJones was watching football with his father one fall weekend when he announced, \"Dad, I think I want to play quarterback in college.\" Knowing that the path to a college scholarship for someone Jones' size might be more achievable at point guard than at quarterback, his father replied, \u201cWhat makes you want to play quarterback?\"\n\nBy that point, Jones had studied the position for awhile. He told his father he thought he'd make better decisions distributing the ball than many quarterbacks he'd watched.\n\n\"I thought that was a pretty good way for him to come at it,\" Jones' father says now. \u201cPhysically, I couldn\u2019t see that he was going to be 6-5, 220. He was so slight at that stage.\u201d\n\nAt that point, it seemed Jones\u2019 edge had to be the mental side.\n\nThe first time Jones competed to become the varsity quarterback at Charlotte Latin School, his lack of size and strength diminished his chances. McNulty anointed a strong-armed, out-of-state transfer as his starter entering the 2012 football season. Jones, still only 5-foot-11, 145 pounds, settled for the backup gig.\n\nEverything changed during Charlotte Latin\u2019s season opener that year when the starter struggled and McNulty turned to Jones during the second half. Jones took advantage of the opportunity, playing well enough to not only win the game but also the job.\n\n\u201cThe following week, I brought the older kid in and I said, \u2018Daniel has earned the right to start,\u2019 \u201d McNulty said. \u201cThe kid left town after that. The dad pulled him out of Latin and went back to the Midwest. I never saw him again. Here I am with a 145-pound sophomore as my quarterback for the rest of the year.\u201d\n\nToo noodle-armed to throw downfield or zip passes into tight windows during his first season as a starter, Jones compensated by making shrewd reads and throwing perfectly timed balls. He also displayed the toughness to withstand crushing hits from bigger kids and pop right back up.\n\nA late growth spurt, more film study and long hours in the weight room helped Jones become a more complete quarterback as an upperclassman, but interest from power-conference college coaches was scarce. Some schools had already identified their quarterback targets for the 2015 class by the time Jones shot up in size. It also didn\u2019t help that Jones broke his wrist late in his junior year and couldn\u2019t participate in some of the region\u2019s most prominent summer camps.\n\nJones was planning to play for Princeton until after his senior season when McNulty placed a phone call on his behalf. The Charlotte Latin coach urged Duke\u2019s David Cutcliffe to take one last look at Jones\u2019 film to see if he had any interest.\n\nThe next morning at 7 a.m., McNulty\u2019s phone rang. It was Cutcliffe calling to beg McNulty not to show the film to any other coaches.\n\nDaniel Jones high-fives fans after defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 32-31 at Raymond James Stadium on Sept. 22, 2019, in Tampa, Florida. (Getty Images)\n\nStatistics don\u2019t tell the full story\n\nBecause he figured success in the ACC would mean more to NFL scouts than throwing touchdowns in the Ivy League, Jones flipped from Princeton to Duke even though Cutcliffe did not have a scholarship available right away. He started for the Blue Devils his final three years, flashing NFL potential during memorable victories over Notre Dame and North Carolina but never managing to elevate his team to national prominence.\n\nCritics saw his 17-19 career record as a Duke starting quarterback. They overlooked that Jones\u2019 two bowl victories in three seasons were more than the Blue Devils had tallied in the previous five-plus decades.\n\nCritics saw his modest 60.5 percent completion rate as a redshirt junior. They overlooked that his offensive line struggled to keep him upright and that his receivers dropped a startling number of catchable passes.\n\nIt also didn\u2019t help Jones that the franchise that reached to draft him had an unpopular general manager and an 8-24 record the past two seasons. Whereas the New England Patriots might get the benefit of the doubt from the public for bucking conventional wisdom with a first-round pick, the Giants were never going to have that luxury.\n\nThose factors combined to inspire indignation and mockery when the Giants selected Jones sixth overall. New York fans even booed Jones in mid-June when Yankee Stadium\u2019s jumbotron showed him during a game.\n\n\u201cDaniel\u2019s human, so I\u2019m sure it hurt him, but he\u2019s so mature and level-headed about things,\u201d McNulty said. \u201cThe revenge mode, I\u2019m-going-to-prove-the-world-wrong mindset, I don\u2019t think Daniel thinks like that. I think it just slid right off his back. He knew what he could do, he was confident in his skills and he went to work.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s performance against Tampa Bay was only one game against a subpar opponent, but it made an instant superstar out of Jones in the New York market. Five months after its back-page headline on draft night read \u201cBlue\u2019s Clueless\u201d, the New York Post went with \u201cDan-O-Mite\u201d after his impressive debut.\n\nTo fully appreciate how far things have come for Jones, consider the question Giants coach Pat Shurmur fielded on Wednesday in New York. Asked if his quarterback\u2019s demeanor had changed at all after his confidence-inspiring comeback against the Bucs, Shurmur noted that Jones is no more likely to let in-season praise impact him than he would preseason criticism.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking if he has a big head?\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re asking? No. No. Not at all. I see the same player I saw last week preparing to play his first game.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "When his name was called on draft night, Daniel Jones endured a cacophony of boos.
