So far, the only thing he seems to have destroyed is U.S. credibility in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest move rewards a fellow NATO member for behaving badly, as he has done multiple times before when dealing with Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government has held U.S. citizens and State Department employees hostage, helped Iran evade U.S. sanctions at the height of Washington\u2019s efforts to thwart Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions between 2012 and 2014, and most recently procured the Russian-made S-400 air defense system despite frequent warnings against doing so.\n\nSo far, Erdogan has miraculously walked away without any major diplomatic pushback, sanctions, or fines from the United States owing to an inexplicable leniency that belies Trump\u2019s tough talk. Even as the U.S. president was reinforcing his Turkish counterpart\u2019s sense of impunity, he was selling out the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), comprising Syrian Kurds, Arabs, Syriac Christians, and Yazidis who have been key partners in defeating the Islamic State while sacrificing more than 11,000 of their soldiers in the effort.\n\nTrump\u2019s hasty action risks undermining all the gains that U.S. special operations forces and their SDF partners have secured to defeat the Islamic State. A recent report by the U.S. Defense Department inspector general warned that the Islamic State \u201csolidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was resurging in Syria.\u201d There are further credible reports of Islamic State efforts \u201cto replenish its ranks from members held in detention facilities.\u201d\n\nGiven that these terrorist detainees are dispersed in a number of facilities, some of which are deep in Syrian territory, there is no way that Turkish troops and their proxies can take control of such facilities from the SDF in an orderly fashion. The logical result of the inevitable clashes between Turkey and the SDF will be a redeployment of SDF forces from the detention facilities to the front lines, leading inevitably to mass prison escapes and an Islamic State resurgence. If the Islamic State makes a comeback, triggering attacks not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and the continental United States, this will all be laid rightly at Trump\u2019s doorstep.\n\nThe humanitarian consequences will be no less worrisome. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom warned in its 2019 annual report that any planned withdrawal from northeastern Syria should be \u201cconducted in such a manner that will not negatively impact the rights and survival of vulnerable religious and ethnic minorities,\u201d a message the commission reiterated following Trump\u2019s latest announcement.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Islamist proxies in Afrin, which took control of the area following Turkey\u2019s cross-border operation into northern Syria in 2018, have been implicated in numerous human rights violations against ethnic and religious minorities in the city\u2014violations almost certain to be replicated in northeastern Syria.\n\nErdogan\u2019s plans for demographic engineering in the region are a further recipe for disaster. The Turkish president announced at the United Nations General Assembly that he intends to settle up to 3 million mainly Arab Syrian refugees in northeastern Syria as part of a sinister attempt to turn Kurdish-majority areas into Arab-majority ones. Such a blatant manipulation of the regional ethnic balance is certain to fuel intercommunal tensions and violence in decades to come, further sowing the seeds of hatred and enmity in a region already seething with more than its fair share of prejudices and grievances.\n\nAn important word of caution about the sinister motivations behind Erdogan\u2019s Syria plans could have come from Turkey\u2019s pro-secular opposition bloc, which succeeded in defeating Erdogan in the recent municipal elections in Ankara and Istanbul. But Trump\u2019s threats to destroy and obliterate Turkey\u2019s economy have effectively gagged the opposition.\n\nErdogan instead benefits from a rally-round-the-flag effect in advance of an anticipated military incursion into Syria and activation of anti-American sentiment that bolsters a government badly scathed by the recent economic downturn, election defeat, and defections of some of the founding figures of the ruling party. Trump\u2019s bewildering rhetoric and policy zigzags have not only hurt the prospects for secular political forces on both sides of the Turkish-Syrian border; the president has also offered a lifeline to struggling Islamists there.\n\nTrump\u2019s Syria tactics have hurt the United States as much as its partners. The latest abandoning of U.S. allies has solidified an already widespread belief in the Middle East and beyond that the United States is not a reliable ally. As Russia and Iran offer the Syrian theater as proof that they are reliable partners that will stand by their allies, state and nonstate actors will pivot from Washington toward Moscow and Tehran as part of an attempt to hedge their foreign and security policies.\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to yield in the face of Erdogan\u2019s threats will create a vacuum that Moscow and Tehran will be only too willing to fill, doing lasting damage to the interests of the United States and its European allies. There is no better time to remind Trump that what\u2019s at stake is not just the future of Syria but the fate of the region and Washington\u2019s credibility as an ally.", "description": "", "authors": ["Eric S.
