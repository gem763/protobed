The two sectors have been red hot for most of 2019 and that\u2019s still true by wide margins, based on a set of exchange traded funds.\n\nXLK Daily Chart\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: ), the strongest year-to-date performer, is currently posting a sizzling 31.1% total return through yesterday\u2019s close (Oct. 10). Although the fund has been treading water for the last two months, it continues to change hands just below a record high that was set in July.\n\nXLRE Daily Chart\n\nShares of real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a strong runner-up performer this year. Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: ) is ahead by 29.6% this year after factoring in distributions. In contrast with XLK\u2019s recent meandering run of late, XLRE\u2019s enjoyed a relatively consistent, ongoing climb through 2019.\n\nXLE Daily Chart\n\nAll the major U.S. equity sectors are posting year to date gains, but there\u2019s a wide spread between the leader and the laggard. Energy shares are the weakest corner among the major U.S. sectors. Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: ) is up just 2.2% in 2019 and is struggling to hold to a slim gain.\n\nOne analyst sees energy\u2019s weak run this year as a possible value opportunity. \u201cWe believe favorable technicals, improving fundamentals with stabilizing business cycle, and ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could help redirect flows into this universally hated and cheap sector,\u201d Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist for JP Morgan Chase, wrote in a research note recently.\n\nETF Total Return Chart\n\nDiffusion Index - Sectors\n\nReviewing momentum for U.S. equity sectors continues to reflect an upside bias generally, but recent trading reflects a round of weakness for the short-term profile. The analysis is based on two sets of moving averages for the ETFs listed above. The first compares the 10-day moving average with its 100-day counterpart \u2014 a proxy for short-term trending behavior (red line in chart below). A second set of moving averages (50 and 200 days) represents an intermediate measure of the trend (blue line). As of yesterday\u2019s close, the two indicators continue to reflect positive momentum for most sectors. Note, however, that the short-term metric has tumbled recently. So far it looks like noise, but the question remains: Will the intermediate trend (blue line), which remains much stronger, weaken too? If this measure of momentum stumbles, the outlook will suffer.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by James Picerno covering: Energy Select Sector SPDR, Technology Select Sector SPDR, Real Estate Select Sector SPDR.
