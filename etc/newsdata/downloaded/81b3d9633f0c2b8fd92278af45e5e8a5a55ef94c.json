And we cannot let him get away with it.\"\n\nBiden had previously indicated that he favored considering impeachment for Trump only if the administration refused to turn over documents to Congress related to the ongoing Ukraine investigation. On Tuesday night, the White House made clear they would not cooperate in any way with the House impeachment probe.\n\nOn its face then, Biden's hand was forced by the White House's decision not to cooperate at all. And that undoubtedly was a factor! But so likely did this fact: In four of the last five national polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a larger share of the national primary vote than Biden. And for the first time in this race, Warren's polling average is now above Biden's -- albeit by .2 percentage points.\n\nWhat those numbers mean is that Biden is really starting to feel the heat from Warren. While she has been rising in polls for months now, it's become clear of late that she isn't slowing down much, even as she approaches and passes Biden, who has been the race's frontrunner since the day he announced his candidacy.", "description": "On Wednesday in New Hampshire, Joe Biden dropped his past protestations against the impeachment of President Donald Trump and, well, just went for it.", "authors": ["Analysis Chris Cillizza", "Cnn Editor-At-Large"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191002164147-11-trump-impeachment-inquiry-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
