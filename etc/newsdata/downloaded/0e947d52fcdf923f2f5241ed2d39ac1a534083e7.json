Catholics from around the world will crowd St. \u00adPeter\u2019s Square to see the greatest religious thinker of Victorian England raised to the altars. Amid the joy and apparent concord of that day, there will be at least two irreconcilable understandings of what has occurred.\n\nOn one side will be those who venerate Newman as the patron saint of liberal Catholicism. They believe that his writings authorize dissent from, and revolutions in, Christian doctrine. In their eyes, his canonization will be a sign that what is denounced as error in one age may later be embraced as truth.\n\nOn the other side will be those who have read \u00adNewman\u2019s stinging denunciations of theological and political liberalism, and therefore imagine that he favored the illiberal and ultramontane form of Catholicism that flourished during the nineteenth century.\n\nBoth these images of Newman are false. Anyone who casts Newman as a liberal Catholic or illiberal ultramontane has constructed a tale less plausible than the most dubious chapter of hagiography. But such mistakes are almost inevitable. Newman\u2019s subtle thought and evocative prose have long induced men of opposite opinions to believe that he must agree with them. During his own life, liberal and anti-liberal Catholics alike hoped he would champion their causes. In each case, he refused.\n\nOf the two false Newmans venerated by Catholics, the liberal Newman is the least plausible. \u201cFor thirty, forty, fifty years I have resisted to the best of my powers the spirit of liberalism in religion,\u201d Newman said toward the end of his eventful life. He had begun his career as an Oxford don and Anglican priest. The Oxford Movement, which he led from 1833 to 1845, opposed religious and political liberalism and sought to recover the catholic character of the Church of England. In 1845, Newman converted to Catholicism, continuing his fight against what he called \u201cthe anti-dogmatic principle.\u201d\n\nNewman battled liberalism primarily within the Church. But he also opposed liberalism in politics insofar as it led men to deny the reality of sin and the need for redemption. Since at least the Glorious Revolution, he believed, \u201cMen saw the good in themselves and not the evil, and consequently were puzzled by the failure of certain parts of the social system to work well, ascribing the failure to a lack of knowledge, rather than of personal virtue.\u201d Liberals believed they could undo the effects of the fall without the aid of grace.\n\nNewman\u2019s belief in human wickedness made him skeptical of progress, in which liberals put such faith. It was an opium of the masses and had left his native Britain \u201cdrugged with this fallacious notion of its superiority to other countries and other times.\u201d In Newman\u2019s view, England would be better off if it were \u201cvastly more superstitious, more bigoted, more gloomy, more fierce in its religion, than at present it shows itself to be.\u201d He preferred retrograde devotion to sophisticated impiety.\n\nNewman insisted that he opposed political liberalism only insofar as it sought \u201cto supersede, to block out, religion,\u201d but he had an expansive definition of what this meant. He looked askance at the most uncontroversial reformist projects if they tended to displace faith. \u00adTeetotalism was one example. He mistrusted the temperance movement because it sought to promote virtue \u201cwithout Religion . . . on mere principles of utility.\u201d Better to be a drunk than a Benthamist.\n\nAfter his conversion, Catholic liberals vainly hoped that the brilliant Newman would join their cause. But he declined to help Lord Acton and Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger, the two great liberal Catholics of the age, in their campaign against the decree of papal infallibility at Vatican I.\n\nThough Newman\u2019s writings on development and conscience would later be put to bad use by clever men, they exclude the kinds of doctrinal revolution and moral autonomy favored by liberals. As Dean Inge hyperbolically observed, Newman\u2019s freethinking admirers fail to realize that Newman \u201cwould gladly have sent some of them to the stake.\u201d\n\nCatholic anti-liberals also misunderstood Newman, if less drastically. In the face of revolutionary attacks on Catholic states across Europe, a group of \u201cultramontanes,\u201d men who identified with the pope \u201cover the mountains\u201d in Italy, insisted on the necessity of the ancien r\u00e9gime. They harked back to a medieval vision of Christendom and defended the pope\u2019s temporal rule over parts of Italy.\n\nOne of these men was Thomas William Allies, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Newman who defended what Allies called \u201cthe medieval system.\u201d Newman startled his disciple by asking whether \u201cCatholic civilisation . . . has been, or shall be, or can be, a good, or per se desirable.\u201d The medieval system was good and necessary in its own time, but was it good and necessary for all time? Even at the height of Christendom, \u00adNewman believed, Scripture\u2019s observation remained true: \u201cThe whole world lies in wickedness.\u201d Declaring the rights of man could not change this grim fact, nor could reviving theocracy.\n\nIn Newman\u2019s view, the illiberal who insisted that the establishment of Catholicism would per se improve society shared the worldly optimism of the liberal. Both imagined that institutional reforms could blot out the stain of original sin.\n\nNewman believed that a Catholic nation would, as a matter of course, make Catholicism its established religion. But such an arrangement was merely \u201cthe accident of a particular state of things,\u201d the spontaneous act of an already-Catholic people. It was not obligatory and need not be imposed. Some creeds require state power to maintain their hold on men, Newman wrote, but Catholicism \u201ccan do without establishment, and often dispenses with it to its advantage.\u201d\n\nLike his friend Richard Hurrell Froude, Newman had long been ready to say \u201cfarewell to feudalism.\u201d In a poem of that title, Froude had lamented the passing of \u00admedieval society. But he urged Christians not to strive \u201cvainly\u201d against that development, which was part of the unfolding of providence. They should remember that \u201cHeaven\u2019s Keys are more than sceptred might,\u201d that God needs no one \u00adsystem of earthly power to exercise his reign.\n\nNewman also broke with the anti-liberals in his understanding of the papacy. He questioned Pius IX\u2019s decision to remove a baptized Jewish boy from his family, an act that the ultramontanes defended. He doubted that temporal sovereignty was necessary for the exercise of the papal office. He noted that Clement XIV had succumbed to monarchs who \u00addemanded that he suppress the Jesuits, despite standing sovereign over the Papal States, whereas Pius VII had resisted the urgings of Napoleon, despite being \u00adNapoleon\u2019s prisoner: \u201cContrast the act of Clement with the act of Pius. The subject-Pontiff has it.\u201d\n\nUnlike some of his ultramontane coreligionists, \u00adNewman had always been willing to make distinctions in his battle against liberalism. He acknowledged \u201cmuch in the liberalistic theory which is good and true,\u201d including \u201cthe precepts of justice, truthfulness, sobriety, self-\u00adcommand, benevolence.\u201d Rather than dismiss these things, he sought to place them on a secure basis in heavenly justice and divine truth.\n\nNewman hoped that the future would offer \u201csome way of uniting what is free in the new structure of society with what is authoritative in the old, without any base compromise with \u2018Progress\u2019 and \u2018Liberalism.\u2019\u201d This must be the project of anyone who wants to follow faithfully in Newman\u2019s footsteps\u2014not an impossible attempt to revive medieval society, nor a rigid insistence on current arrangements.\n\nJust as certain men in Newman\u2019s time consecrated the feudal order, many today regard the liberal order as sacred. Faced with social crises and political discontent, they are unwilling to say farewell to liberalism. Newman would have regarded this as folly. He thought it misguided to insist absolutely on any worldly settlement, whatever its virtues may be. If Christians were once wrong to insist on the feudal order, they are wrong today to insist on a liberal order that not only falls short of Christian ideals, but denies them explicitly.\n\nEvery year, Catholics will commemorate Newman on the day of his conversion, not (as is customary) on the day of his death. This unusual choice, made during the reign of Benedict, has angered some liberals. They rightly see it as a repudiation of the ecumenical hopes that flourished in the wake of Vatican II, when men imagined that all Christian bodies would converge, thus removing the need for conversion to the Catholic faith. It is fitting that the very way in which the Church will celebrate Newman\u2019s sanctity offends against the liberal spirit some seek to divinize. In an age that is dogmatic about everything except dogma, St. John Henry Newman reminds us to place our faith only in eternal things.\n\nMatthew Schmitz is senior editor of First Things.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/first-things-resources/uploads/article_5d769c63b9cf5.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
