Despite warnings from the scientific community, developers including Trump have continued to invest in property that could be underwater before long.\n\n\u201cJust using the U.S. government projections, we could be at 11 to over 13 feet [of sea level rise] by the end of century,\u201d Harold Wanless, director of the University of Miami\u2019s geological sciences department and a leading expert on sea level rise, told Yahoo News. \u201cThere\u2019s only 3 percent of Miami-Dade County that\u2019s greater than 12 feet above sea level.\u201d\n\nTrump has labeled climate change a \u201choax\u201d concocted by the Chinese government in an attempt to ruin the U.S. economy, but not all members of the Republican Party agree. For the first time in a decade, Florida\u2019s state Senate held a meeting this week to discuss the impacts of climate change, the Miami Herald reported.\n\nAP Photo/Andrew Harnik More\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a younger generation of conservatives in this state that aren\u2019t as much in denial,\u201d Republican Sen. Tom Lee, who chairs the Committee on Infrastructure and Security, told the Herald.\n\nYoung climate activists like Sweden\u2019s Greta Thunberg have mobilized students around the world to hold school strikes to protest inaction from world leaders on what they see as a crisis.\n\n\u201cSomething must have changed in the debate that so many young people are speaking up and so many young people are being targeted,\u201d Thunberg told Yahoo News in response to the mockery her movement has received from leaders like Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cThey can sense that we are making an impact. They obviously don\u2019t want that. So they are using several methods to mock and hate.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump continues to deny the threat that climate change poses to his own properties and the world at large, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco released a report Thursday on the financial risks that global warming poses. It found that properties like Doral that are likely to be underwater in the coming years are already selling for 15 percent less than those where flooding is not a threat. Even more jarring, the report warned that climate change poses a \u201cthreat to the availability of the 30-year mortgage in various vulnerable and highly exposed areas.\u201d\n\nThanks to the continued buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due primarily to the use of fossil fuels, the rate at which the polar icecaps are melting continues to exceed previous estimates. As of Aug. 1 of this year, for instance, Greenland had lost a record 12.5 billion tons of ice. This year is on pace to become the second warmest on record, and all of the top 10 hottest years on record \u2014 with the exception of 1998 \u2014 have occurred since 2005.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "President Trump will not be discussing climate change at the next G-7 meeting, his acting chief of staff says.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GeEJ8gItnMdcU4GK5CSGdQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/06a497f0-f118-11e9-bfff-e9612ea9cf9a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
