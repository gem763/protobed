It has about 80 packaging plants and Mr Dayal said that was probably too many. It had also been too slow to respond to changing market conditions.\n\n\"This needs to be corrected,'' Mr Dayal said.\n\nHe said a large part of the strategic review would be completed by the end of the December half.\n\n\"I believe we can reinvent Pact,'' he said. Momentum should begin to build within 12 to 18 months. \"It's about really getting the core right.''\n\nMr Geminder took over the day-to-day running of the business in an expanded executive chairman role in September 2018 following the abrupt departure of then chief executive Malcolm Bundey after the financial performance deteriorated.\n\nPact shares were sitting at $5.30 in mid-August 2018 and have now more than halved. Profit margins in 2018-19 declined to 8.1 per cent from 9.8 per cent. The value of Mr Geminder's stake has now dropped by more than $400 million in the past year alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoldman Sachs said the modest outlook for the company was subdued, and it appeared the group had moved past the absolute worst point.\n\nThe bottom-line loss of $290 million compared with a net profit of $74 million a year ago. Revenues were up 10 per cent to $1.83 billion, as acquisitions such as the TIC garment hangers business which came on to the books in October 31 made a contribution.\n\nLong-term priority\n\nMr Dayal said the review would be extensive but it was being done with a long-term view of making sure there was limited investment in products which weren't a long-term priority and capable of delivering decent returns.\n\n\"I have introduced a sort of customer overlay to the network redesign program,'' he said.\n\nPact has already closed two packaging plants in the June half at Bankstown in Sydney, and one in Melbourne, under an overhaul started by Mr Geminder.\n\nMr Dayal said once some renewed momentum happened in the business and customers became more confident, an acceleration would occur. \"It's not going to take years.''\n\nPact began a large contract with grocery retailer Aldi on August 1 for re-usable crates for fresh produce, and Mr Dayal said that was an important win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPact also announced on Wednesday that Peter Margin, the executive chairman of Asahi's Australian beverages operations, would step down from the board. Asahi made a $16 billion buyout for beer business CUB last month.\n\nMr Geminder is the brother-in-law of Australia's richest person, Anthony Pratt, and a regular in the Financial Review Rich List.\n\nPact was formed in 2002 after Mr Geminder engineered the management buyout of several underperforming assets from Visy Industries.
