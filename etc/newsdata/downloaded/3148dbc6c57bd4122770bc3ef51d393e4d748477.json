State Attorney General Mike Hunter called the decision a \"road map\" for other jurisdictions to follow.\n\nBefore reporting on opioids, Meier followed the tobacco industry through a series of lawsuits in the 1990s. He says that the Johnson & Johnson ruling could play a significant role in holding companies accountable.\n\n\"In the late 1990s, as states started suing them [tobacco companies], it all began to unravel, and I think we're seeing something very similar happening here with both Purdue Pharma and the opioid industry in general,\" he said.\n\nBelow is part of that conversation.\n\nA sign with the Sackler name is displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Thursday, Jan. 17, 2019.

(Seth Wenig/Associated Press)\n\nIf we go back to beginning of this health crisis, it begins with the introduction of OxyContin and the Sackler family. Perhaps you could begin there. Can you tell me who they are?\n\nThe Sackler family is one of the wealthiest, the most secretive families in the United States.\n\nMost people know them, if they know them at all, from their names on museums. Museums like the Metropolitan Museum, the Whitney Museum [and] museums throughout Europe.\n\nBut they were also major players within the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nIn what way?\n\nThere were three brothers originally: Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond Sackler.\n\nArthur Sackler is sort of a pivotal figure in the history of the pharmaceutical industry because he essentially developed the whole advertising of prescription drugs, first to doctors and then eventually to the public.\n\nBoth he and his two younger brothers started the company that eventually became Purdue Pharma. Originally it was known as Purdue Frederick.\n\nCan you give us a sense of the sort of success they had on the market?\n\nThey had a massive success. When Purdue Pharma began selling OxyContin back in the mid-1990s, they totally revolutionized how people thought about the use of powerful opioids or drugs that were actually known as narcotics.\n\nPreviously these drugs had been used largely, at least the strongest ones like OxyContin ... to treat cancer pain; end of life pain.\n\nBut they basically began to market them for the use in all kinds of pain \u2014 arthritis, injuries, dental pain \u2014 promoting them as, really, non-addictive alternatives to other drugs.\n\nAccording to documents uncovered by Meier, Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family were aware that OxyContin was addictive despite marketing to the contrary. (Jessica Hill/The Associated Press)\n\nHow did the Sacklers convince the public that Oxy wasn't as addictive as other painkillers?\n\nThey marketed it that way. I mean the Sacklers, per se, didn't but Purdue Pharma in its marketing to the public and to doctors claim that because it was a long-acting drug, it was different than the traditional painkillers that were on the market.\n\nBecause it had a long-acting formulation, it would be less likely to kind of produce an immediate high, which was the type of high that people that abused prescription painkillers wanted.\n\nAnd that's the way they marketed it and they illegally marketed that way to doctors and plead guilty to criminally doing so in 2007.\n\nHow did they manage to do that for so long? As an original argument, you can see how people might have gone along with that, but there was mounting evidence that this was simply not the case; that the drug was highly addictive.\n\nThey contended, back when I started covering the story in 2000 and even into 2001 ... the addiction and overdose deaths related to OxyContin were being manufactured by the news media.\n\nThat reporters, like myself, were kind of making this all up and inflating it and making claims that weren't statistically, or factually, true, when in fact the entire foundation of how this company began marketing OxyContin \u2014 back in 1996 and 1997 \u2014 was fraudulent and they eventually acknowledged that.\n\nWe have to see whether the settlement does go through. If it does go through, basically [the Sacklers] have used their fortune to protect the rest of their fortune and will go on with their lives as they see fit. - Barry Meier, journalist\n\nYou've spoken a number of times here about the marketing strategy and they amassed an enormous fortune. Can you give us a sense of how much money they managed to make from this drug and its marketing?\n\nApparently since the introduction of OxyContin in 1996, there were about $35 billion ... worth of sales.\n\nAnd the Sackler family fortune, I believe it was estimated by Forbes magazine as approaching about $13 billion.\n\nIf we look at their involvement in Purdue Pharma, some of what we've been told is that they took a back seat; they tried to present themselves as not being involved every day. But how involved were the Sacklers with Purdue Pharma?\n\nOne of the more interesting things about the current wave of litigation, and the types of documents that are starting to emerge now, is that we're really getting the first glimpse at how deeply involved, apparently, members of the Sackler family were in this company.\n\nThey were successful in building a wall around them and creating what may prove to be a mirage about their lack of involvement. But, in fact, this family owned Purdue Pharma, the executives of the company reported to the Sackler family.\n\nSo in any closely-held, privately-run company, as Purdue Pharma is, surely the owners \u2014 the Sackler family \u2014 are the ones who are likely going to be calling the shots.\n\nAccording to Meier, the reality of OxyContin's dangers didn't reach public consciousness \u2014 and lawmakers' attention \u2014 until users began overdosing on Fentanyl, a more potent drug sometimes sold as oxycodone. (DEA via Associated Press)\n\nYou got your hands on a couple of sets of documents over the years. What did they reveal?\n\nThese were pretty extraordinary documents, I wrote about them in Pain Killer, the newest edition.\n\nAnd what they showed was that number one, federal prosecutors had developed evidence back in the mid-2000s showing what they believed to be true which is, number one, that Purdue Pharma was aware of the growing and widespread abuse of OxyContin long before the company acknowledged it.\n\nAnd number two, that on certain occasions, executives of the company made members of the Sackler family aware of the abuse of company drugs.\n\nAnd now they're about to pay approximately $3 billion US and that's from the family purse. They're also going to give up their stake in a company. What was the turning point?\n\nI was thinking about that and there is a famous fighter by the name of Roberto Dur\u00e1n who, during one of his pivotal fights, held up his hands in front of his face and said \"no mas\" or \"no more\".\n\nAnd I think at this juncture, the Sackler family \u2014 the ones who were involved in running Purdue Pharma \u2014 have reached a point where the consequences of the potential liabilities that they face going forward outweigh the benefits that they have in saying, well, we're going to fight this thing and they basically are trying to say \"no mas\".\n\nWhat happens to the Sacklers now after these cases are settled? Are they free from the entire case now that the settlement is looking like it will go through?\n\nFirst of all, we have to see whether the settlement does go through. If it does go through, basically they have used their fortune to protect the rest of their fortune and will go on with their lives as they see fit.\n\nThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "OxyContin was supposed to revolutionize pain management.
