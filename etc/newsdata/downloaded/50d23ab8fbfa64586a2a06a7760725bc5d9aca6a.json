If Vice President Pence ascends to the top job, what would his foreign policy look like?\n\nThis may seem premature. Much depends on what actually emerges from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry. An actual impeachment may need to wait until after midterm elections are held. Then, they might only proceed if the Democrats regain the majority. But if the unpredictable first 120 days of the Trump presidency are any guide, there is no telling what the coming period will bring.\n\nIndeed, it took essentially 120 days \u2014 from May 9, 1974, when the House Judiciary Committee opened formal impeachment proceedings against President Nixon, until his resignation on August 9 \u2014 for the Watergate scandal to conclude. Beyond impeachment, there's a chance Trump may simply resign.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe two of us have spent a combined 20 years in the United States government, in key foreign policy institutions \u2014 Defense, Homeland Security, State, the Agency for International Development and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 and one of us hails from Pence\u2019s home state of Indiana. Given the current volatility, we thought it important to share ideas on what President Pence\u2019s foreign policy might look like.\n\nTwo major aspects would characterize Pence\u2019s foreign policy: a re-embrace of the Republican establishment and an aggressive uptake of Christian social conservative thought.\n\nAmong the Republican establishment, particularly the neoconservative wing, Pence has an impeccable reputation. Many describe him as a \u201chawk\u2019s hawk.\u201d He was a strong proponent of the Iraq War, has vigorously stood up for a strong military and \"American values\" and, as vice president, has taken on an informal role as an emissary to NATO and other alliances. All of this contrasts starkly to what candidate Trump said on the campaign trail.\n\nLikewise, Pence\u2019s evangelical Christian faith is central to his identity. He has proudly built up a reputation as one of the most conservative lawmakers in the country and frequently describes himself as \u201ca Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\u201d There is a high probability that Pence would explicitly embed religious morals in U.S. foreign policy and push an activist social conservative agenda.\n\nFor example, as the governor of Indiana, Pence signed one of the strictest abortion provisions in the country and approved a controversial law intended to allow businesses to deny services to members of the LGBT community for religious reasons (only after intense blowback did he backtrack). Translated into the foreign policy realm, it is not hard to imagine Pence defending Christian minorities around the world, possibly to the exclusion of other religious groups.\n\nHe will undoubtedly continue Trump\u2019s expansion of the \u201cglobal gag rule,\" and it is possible he may try to push a \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d strategy, primarily seeking alliances with countries that have a \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d character.\n\nBut a Pence presidency could also mean re-adopting a \u201cvalues agenda,\u201d with a greater emphasis on human rights, democracy and development that would be closer in line with President George W. Bush\u2019s policies. Under Bush, funding for development \u2014 particularly global health programs \u2014 expanded, bringing together an unlikely coalition of secular development advocates and faith-based stakeholders.\n\nIt is not hard to envision a similar coalition coming together under Pence\u2019s watch. A Pence presidency also may lead to a shoring-up of security and economic alliances. Just as Trump has cast the free-trade regime into jeopardy, castigated NATO (at least before an abrupt about-face last month) and signaled massive funding cuts to the Bretton Woods Institutions, Pence may reverse many of these pronouncements.\n\nIn the current configuration of the Trump administration, three separate groups tangle for foreign policy primacy: the economic nationalists/populists led by Stephen Bannon, the military pragmatists represented by Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and the economic globalists fronted by National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n\nUnder Pence, the Bannon wing would likely make a quick and graceless exit. The economic globalists and the military pragmatists would stay entrenched in strong positions, but old groups would likely return, such as the neoconservatives and religious faith leaders.\n\nA Pence presidency would bring big style changes. Gone would be the late night tweets and blustery rhetoric. More than likely, \u201cAmerica First\u201d would gradually disappear, with a return to a more traditional form of American exceptionalism. The impulsivity, erratic swings of policy and casual disregard for intelligence and briefing material would also likely pass.\n\nThese changes alone would considerably ease fears about an accidental stumble into a major war or nuclear confrontation. On the other hand, the divisive culture wars that have framed Pence\u2019s political career would presumably return in a major way and likely spill over into the foreign policy arena.\n\nOn a regional basis, we can also expect significant differences. In the Middle East, President Trump has focused on three issues thus far: Israeli-Palestinian peace, countering ISIS and containing Iran. While it is unlikely that President Pence would jettison any of these efforts, what is likely is that he would reprioritize and change the tenor of engagements.\n\nOn the Israeli-Palestinian front, Pence might be less likely to swing for the fences to achieve an unlikely peace and might side even more closely with Israel. He would also most certainly continue to counter ISIS, but would do so in a manner less aligned with Russia, which might mean more direct pressure on the Syrian regime.\n\nOn Iran, President Pence would likely not reverse Trump\u2019s policy to both stick to the nuclear agreement but build pressure on Iran through closer ties to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council, but he might inject a push for greater democracy and human rights, which would certainly strain ties.\n\nTurning to Asia, Pence\u2019s approach to North Korea may not vary appreciably from the current strategy \u2014 ramp up economic pressure and sanctions and convince China to play a more assertive role in reigning in Kim Jong-un \u2014 but Pence will refrain from Trump\u2019s Twitter baiting and will tamp down the bellicose rhetoric.\n\nInstead, expect a more concerted, behind-the-scenes effort to force the North Korean regime to the negotiating table. When it comes to China, we can anticipate more consistent pushback from Pence, including reestablishing clear markers on the South China Sea and efforts to put together a TPP-like economic alliance to counter China\u2019s ambition.\n\nFinally, there is Russia. If Congress forces Trump out of office, it will be due in large part to charges of collusion with Russia. Undoubtedly, this will reverse the current rapprochement that Trump is engineering. It is also a safe bet that, under Pence, the days of sharing codeword-level intelligence with Russian diplomats in the Oval Office would be over. Most likely, we would see a return to an icy standoff between the United States and Russia, characterized by increasingly hostile rhetoric and mistrust.\n\nWhile we are not advocating impeachment, we view it as increasingly possible. Thus, the implications of a Pence presidency are valuable for all of us to ponder \u2014Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nHady Amr served in the Obama administration as deputy special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and as deputy head of the Middle East Bureau at USAID.
