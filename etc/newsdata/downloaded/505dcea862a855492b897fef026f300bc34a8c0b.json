In fact, abnormal weather mostly contributed to the hole\u2019s reduced size.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great news for ozone in the Southern Hemisphere,\u201d said Paul Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in a statement. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to recognize that what we\u2019re seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures. It\u2019s not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery.\u201d\n\nOzone is a molecule with three oxygen atoms that is abundant in gas form in the ozone layer, a part of the atmosphere located roughly seven to 25 miles above our planet\u2019s surface. Ozone gas plays an important role in shielding life on Earth from the Sun\u2019s damaging ultraviolet radiation. The ozone layer absorbs these UV rays as they enter the atmosphere, and prevents them from reaching the ground.\n\nDuring the 1980s, scientists realized that the ozone layer was becoming rapidly depleted around the South Pole. Their research linked this trend directly to the use of human chemical pollutants, especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) common in products such as aerosol sprays, pesticides, and flame retardants.\n\nIf the hole continued to grow, scientists predicted that the increased radiation could cause a spike in rates of skin cancer in humans and would damage many ecosystems with inadequate resilience to UV radiation.\n\nAs a result, CFCs and other pollutants were banned as part of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987. The Montreal Protocol is often held up as a major international environmental success story because it has led to a slow recovery of the ozone layer in Antarctica.\n\nIn an average year, the ozone hole grows to about eight million square miles in September and October. But on September 8, 2019, it maxed out for the year at 6.3 million square miles. This is part of the ozone recovery trend that has been confirmed in recent years, but has more to do with higher-than-normal temperatures in Antarctica that disfavored ozone depletion.\n\nSeptember and October mark the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s transition from winter to spring, which drives the formation of the hole. Ozone is most depleted over the Antarctic because of the extremely cold clouds that form in the wintery polar vortex at the South Pole. When the Sun\u2019s springtime rays start to warm the clouds, chlorine molecules from human-made pollutants break up ozone molecules at high rates, causing the annual hole to form in the ozone layer.\n\nBecause stratospheric temperatures were about 16\u02daC warmer on average this spring, the impacts of the polar vortex on yearly ozone loss was mitigated.\n\nScientists aren\u2019t sure if this extra-warm season is linked to climate change, but NASA, NOAA, and other agencies and institutions will continue to monitor ozone depletion at least until the Antarctic hole returns to its 1980 size. That recovery is expected to happen by 2070, provided the world continues to honor the Montreal Protocol.", "description": "While this is great news, scientists say it\u2019s not a sign that the ozone layer is \u201con a fast track to recovery.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dae19d45c1f5f000a321f1d/lede/1571690971986-2019hole1.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
