If so, you might enjoy these photos of the Bollinger Motors B1 and B2 electric trucks.\n\nWe covered the company in early 2018, when it revealed the first images of its four-door B1. On Thursday at a live-streamed event, it showed off a beta prototype of the the B1, which it calls a sports utility truck, as well as the B2, a more conventional pickup truck.\n\nThey share the most of the same technical specs. It's a 458kW (614hp), 905Nm (668lb-ft) dual-motor, all-wheel drive design, with a whopping 120kWh lithium-ion battery pack between the axles. Even with that much power and torque, don't expect Taycan-rivaling performance; 0-60mph might take 4.5 seconds, but these EVs are limited to 100mph (160km/h) flat-out.\n\nWhich makes sense, because the vehicles' designer, Robert Bollinger, came up with the idea after getting frustrated with using traditional trucks on his farm in New York. \"Pickup trucks haven't changed in forever; they've just got plusher and more expensive. The B1 is about what I need: having a farm, being an adult, knowing I have to go to Home Depot sometimes, or there's going to be two feet of snow\u2014this is your one multitool vehicle for everything,\" he told me when we spoke last year.\n\nIt's a most utilitarian design, with a passthrough that allows you to carry long cargo\u201424 planks of 2x4 for example. The B1 and B2 will both be rated to carry 5,201lbs (2,359kg) of cargo, with a 7,500lb (3,401kg) towing capacity. And there's a two-speed transmission for high and low-range, and between 10 and 20 inches (25-51cm) of ground clearance, so either the B1 or B2 should be pretty handy when the tarmac runs out.\n\nProduction isn't scheduled to begin until later next year, and we'll have to wait until closer to the time to find out things like an EPA range or the price. The company says that it is planning on a minimum of 200 miles between charges, and when I spoke with Bollinger last year he told me that it won't be cheap, but it also won't be quite as expensive as some might think.\n\n\"We're electric, we're low-volume, we're basically hand-built, so we're not going to be cheap. When we come out with our price point there will be some people who think we're a $200,000 vehicle, who will be pleasantly surprised. There are some people who want it to be a Jeep Wrangler-type vehicle, but there's no way that'll happen,\" he told me.\n\nListing image by Bollinger Motors", "description": "The four-door B1 SUV and B2 pickup go into production next year.", "authors": ["Jonathan M.
