In an attempt to calm the situation, Whoopi Goldberg stepped in, which caused even more pushback from McCain.\n\n\"Everybody take a breath,\" Goldberg says as McCain continues to talk. \"Hold on, let me just finish. What I\u2019m saying... everybody has something to say at the table. We really do want to hear from everybody.\"\n\n\"But we're starting to do that thing,\" Goldberg explains before McCain cuts in, saying, \"I don\u2019t know what that means, this thing?\"\n\n\"It means you are talking over each other,\" Goldberg responds, to which McCain snaps back, \"Well, it's The View.\"\n\nRemaining calm, Goldberg notes that she's just trying to make sure everyone's voice gets heard. \"It is The View, let me tell you something about The View. This show has always had the ability to have different points of view, which we respect around the table,\" she tells her co-host. \"When we talk to each other, we also exhibit respect. So, when I\u2019m saying to you, 'Hold up, because we\u2019re not hearing each other,' I\u2019m not trying to cut you off, I\u2019m trying to get you heard.\"\n\nAcknowledging what Goldberg is saying, McCain notes, \"I don\u2019t think you\u2019re trying to cut me off but...\"\n\nGoldberg then has to cut her off, telling viewers, \"But that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing right now, we\u2019ll be back!\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ET at the start of this season, McCain shared what it's like being the only conservative voice on the panel of The View.\n\n\"I try to just remind myself that I'm representing 50% of the country,\" she said at the time. \"I'm representing a bunch of women even though I only have one chair, and it's really important.\"\n\n\"Some days are really smooth and some days are Jeanine Pirro,\" McCain continued, referring to an explosive exchange between the Fox News host and Goldberg during Pirro's appearance on the show last year. \"It just depends on what the day is.\"\n\nLast week, Goldberg addressed speculation that McCain and Behar do not get along off camera. \"Listen, if they didn't like each other, they would not be on TV together, I'm just sort of saying,\" she said on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. \"I don't really think about their relationship. I'm actually thinking strictly about myself.\"\n\nThe View airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET, 10 a.m PT/CT on ABC.\n\nET also spoke with McCain and Behar about their relationship on and off camera.
