It\u2019s going to stall out tomorrow and into Tuesday. Cat. 5, 160 mile an hour winds, surge. And I know people are getting tired because this has been a long-duration storm and it hasn\u2019t even touched Florida or the East Coast.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Dorian reached Category 5 strength as it moved closer to the Bahamas, joining the ranks of several other high-power storms that have surpassed 145 mph winds in the month of August, including Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Dean in 2007. Forecasters expect Dorian to move closer to the East Coast on Monday and believe it could make landfall on the South Carolina coast as soon as Wednesday. A state of emergency has already been declared for all of Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina, as well as a dozen counties in Georgia.\n\n\u201cSo we want people to \u2014 don\u2019t dismiss this storm,\u201d Gaynor added. \u201cWe are not out of it. Life-threatening, dangerous surge, water, wind is coming your way. Take the time now to prepare you and your family.\u201d\n\nAlthough Florida could avoid a direct hit, Gaynor warns there is still serious danger.\n\nFlorida Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on what's hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

You\u2019ve got to take this storm seriously.\u201d\n\nGaynor reiterated FEMA is prepared for the impending storm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for five or six days, preparing,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve been activated in the national response coordination center, which you can see behind me. We have food, water, generators, staff, helicopters, ambulances \u2014 from Florida all the way to North Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe acting head also noted that his agency has \u201cplenty of money and resources to deal with 2017 and 2018 disaster recoveries and to include response in 2019, this season\u201d \u2014 despite the Department of Homeland Security's decision to divert $155 million in federal disaster aid to bolster immigration enforcement last month.\n\n\u201cWe live with risk everyday,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cWe assess risk. We assessed that the $155 million was low risk and is not affecting our preparedness whatsoever for Dorian.\u201d", "description": "\u201cDon\u2019t dismiss this storm,\u201d Pete Gaynor says.", "authors": ["Aubree Eliza Weaver"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e7/38/40cd424c4d69a6461a31d959b58d/dorian-ap-773.jpg"}
