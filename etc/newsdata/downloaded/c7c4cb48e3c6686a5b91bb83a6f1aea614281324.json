The results at Blue Sky and Goldman Sachs-backed Atira, and the pending result at the country's No.4 player Urbanest, are believed to have sparked Citiplan's decision to test market appetite.\n\nStreet Talk hears the other factor in the owners' decision to sell was a realisation that it may struggle to reach scale in the local market, and it was better to get out once its Swanston Street project was complete.\n\nThe sale comes after pension fund-backed Scape Australia wiped out the competition to buy Atira's student accommodation portfolio in a $680 million deal that made it the largest student accommodation owner and operator in the country. The sector gorilla is also in exclusive talks to buy Urbanest, Australia's fourth largest student accommodation provider.\n\nIt seems unlikely Scape would bite on the Journal sale given its recent acquisitions, which opens the door to underbidders on the Atira and Urbanest deals.\n\nThat list include the likes of GSA Australia, Cedar Pacific, Greystar and Iglu Student Accommodation.\n\nOne difficulty facing Journal is that it doesn't have a proven operating platform with just two assets in Melbourne, although it has invested heavily in both. As a result the portfolio may make sense as a complementary addition to an already established operator.", "description": "A property fund majority owned by South Africa's Redefine Properties is seeking a buyer for its Australian student accommodation portfolio.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_279/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1c7f4361a20aec76b7502363726716cc2f1450e9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
