He talked to his roommate, he took his meds, and he went to bed. At 6 o'clock Sunday morning the 28th, his roommate went to the nurse's station for a blood draw and said to the nurses\u2014there were two nurses on staff for 70 patients in three separate buildings\u2014\u2018Oh, by the way Matt's not in his bed. He hasn't been in there since 5 o'clock when I woke up.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn't rush to go look for him, and then when the shift was changing the one nurse was leaving and walked around the outside of the building,\u201d she continues. \u201cShe looked down the hill and she saw my brother kneeling and she later said she thought he was picking grass to feed the horses \u2026 he had walked out the back door undetected because for some reason, in the acute wing of a psychiatric hospital, there were no bells, no whistles, no walks, no cameras, no nothing, just the fence. He went down the hill and hanged himself on a tree. They found him at 8:05 in the morning.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit Burne\u2019s family eventually filed against The Meadows was settled out of court, and she started up her own nonprofit, called Break the Silence, in memory of her brother. But she says the system is irreparably flawed, and blames doctors for much of its deficiency. Neither The Meadows nor its legal representation returned requests for comment.\n\n\u201cHe did everything right,\u201d she says of Matt. \u201cHe reached out for help and he was miserably and irreversibly failed \u2026 I just think that caregivers really need to understand that every person is an individual, and if they can't put the time and effort and energy into really knowing their patient \u2026 then they\u2019re in the wrong field. They have to go back to their own conscience and wonder about the care they gave that person. Did they give that person the best care that they could at that moment? Did they trust in the system? Did they not pay attention to their gut? I can't answer for them. I would just think if you see somebody that's vacillating\u2014and maybe I'm wrong, but from what I've seen, I don't think happy smiling people just in five minutes go and kill themselves. I think there are signs.\u201d\n\nChristine Moutier is Chief Medical Officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. She says this type of sentiment is normal among many family members who have lost someone to suicide, and sometimes warranted. \u201cI think there are many actual mistakes that get made,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are doctors who simply don\u2019t meet the standard of care. And then there are doctors who may not have made a single actual mistake, but the family perceives the treatment as not going well. Human nature is to need to find a reason for things. But if you get asked the same question about an oncologist who loses a patient to cancer, the family is much more likely to understand that the person had a terminal illness, so the best care happened but the outcome was still death. We tend to not think of [mental illness] usually in such black-and-white terms, as terminal illness..\u201d", "description": "Mental-health practitioners whose clients kill themselves can face stigma from their colleagues, lawsuits, and a toll on their own psyches\u2014making them less likely to take on suicidal patients who need their help.", "authors": ["Sulome Anderson"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/04/RTR4OCYQ/facebook.jpg?1523994898"}
