How one factory explains the Brexit business dilemma Read more\n\nDe Ficchy was speaking at the Sunderland plant, which last year produced its 10 millionth car and has become the UK\u2019s biggest car manufacturing site since it was opened by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government in 1986.\n\n\n\nHe said a decision to end night shifts at the plant was not linked to Brexit but was aimed at optimising the two production lines for the models built there, including the new Juke.\n\n\n\nHe said the workforce at Sunderland was an asset to be preserved, with a successful history of producing 10 million \u201chigh quality\u201d vehicles.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know the workforce is concerned about that [Brexit] situation \u2013 we are also concerned. That\u2019s the reason we are here, to express our concerns.\u201d", "description": "Imposition of WTO tariffs on exports could put Sunderland plant at risk, says chair", "authors": ["Josh Halliday"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f88c106531df82aebfdbe23a249dd8b37adc78/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6aed714ce0a25a9e7e2d917de6122f1e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
