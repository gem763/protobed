In my last post I highlighted the strong ceiling of resistance building at the $91 per share level, coupled with the floor of support at $86 per share and denoted with the blue dashed line of the accumulation and distribution indicator. Both were equally strong, the width of the line indicating how many times each had been tested and held with the volume point of control sandwiched between.\n\nIn the last three weeks we have seen the stock break through the ceiling of resistance and move higher, however, not perhaps with the conviction one might wish. Note the falling volume and in last week\u2019s price action the stock rallied to $95.70 before closing at $93.90 on a deep wicked candle with high volume so we can expect some short term weakness.\n\nLong term with the deep platform of support now in place and with the price action approaching a low volume node on the VPOC indicator, this is one stock I expect to continue higher and confirmed by the trend monitor indicator which has now reverted to bright blue on the weekly chart. Analysts will be looking toward the next release on November 1 with a forecast of $1.73 against $1.65 for the equivalent quarter in 2018, and which if achieved should help to drive further momentum into the stock.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Anna Coulling covering: Duke Energy Corporation.
