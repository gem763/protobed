At the same time, the populist right-wing AfD more than doubled its standing and was marginally ahead of the CDU at 24%, the poll showed.\n\nThe Social Democrats, Merkel\u2019s junior coalition partner, also lost ground, shedding roughly four percentage points to 8.5%. As a result, the incumbent Left party will no longer have sufficient support to govern Thuringia with its current alliance that also include the Greens.\n\nThe result in the eastern German state reflects the increasingly splintered political spectrum in Germany, where traditional centrist parties have been losing steadily. The refugee crisis, climate protests, and more recently an economic slowdown and geopolitical tension in Europe\u2019s backyard have fueled rifts among and even within political parties.\n\n\u201cSince 1949, we have not had such a result, where the parties of the democratic center in Germany are unable to form a government,\u201d CDU candidate Mike Mohring told reporters in Erfurt Sunday night. \u201cThis is a really bitter result.\u201d\n\nStumble\n\nIt\u2019s the latest sign of trouble for Merkel in the twilight of her chancellorship. Europe\u2019s largest economy has slowed sharply and will expand only a projected 0.5% this year, compared with 2.5% two years ago. At the same time, her designated successor, Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has failed to gain traction in her party, while repeatedly stumbling as she seeks to win back voters from the far-right.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer, who replaced Merkel as chief of the CDU late last year, fueled animosity in the coalition when she proposed a peace-keeping force for northern Syria involving German troops without consulting the SPD.\n\n\u201cGiven the strong showing by the far right, the CDU debate about the best path into the post-Merkel world is set to continue,\u201d Carsten Nickel, analyst at Teneo Intelligence in London, wrote in a research note.\n\nOn Saturday, the SPD failed to end months of debate over whether to leave government. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, the only candidate who unequivocally backed staying in government, won a first-round party leadership ballot but had only a narrow margin over the runner-up.\n\nCandidates of the leftist camp that favor easing Germany\u2019s fiscal rigor and exiting the coalition got more than half of the vote, versus Scholz\u2019s 22.7%.\n\nThe run-off vote is scheduled to conclude Nov. 30 and the party is to decide in December whether to stay in the coalition.\n\n(Updates with Teneo analyst in eighth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Birgit Jennen.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Arne Delfs in Berlin at adelfs@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Raymond Colitt, Tony Czuczka\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition faced a renewed setback with a resounding defeat in a state election and its main ally wavering over support for the government.Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats plummeted 11 percentage points from 2014 to 22.5% in an election for state assembly in the eastern", "authors": ["Arne Delfs"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pSrqd421KFRRnPhd.jpEiA--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/106b34340f49411436d397f6be6f268e", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
