While the ITV series created by Julian Fellowes had plenty of moving storylines, fans were more into the lavish costumes and stunning settings \u2013 hallmarks of classic Sunday night TV. The acting was good too \u2013 Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary, Hugh Bonneville as her father, Lord Grantham, and Dame Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess were particular highlights. There was scandal, death, marriage, war, infidelity and endless cups of tea. Ultimately, though, Downton was cuddly and harmless. It didn\u2019t try to make any grand allusions to what was taking place in the 21st century. So it was interesting to find that the Downton Abbey movie is essentially a feature-length work of Brexit propaganda, wrapped up in a pretty velvet bow.\n\nFellowes knows the Downton Abbey world well. He was born in Cairo, Egypt, before being raised between South Kensington and Sussex. He attended several private schools, and later read English Literature at Cambridge where he was also a member of the Footlights club. He\u2019s a lifelong Tory, appointed by David Cameron to the House of Lords in 2011. He now lives with his wife, Emma, at a manor house in Dorset with 50 acres of land. This isn\u2019t to say that he doesn\u2019t know what hard work is. He struggled as an actor for years, and scored a few minor roles in LA \u2013 he was the chauffeur in Rita Hayworth: The Love Goddess \u2013 but lost out on a part in Fantasy Island, which he believed would have been his big break. He has expressed concern about social mobility in the UK, criticising the education system, and his portrayals of class, racial and gender divide in the Downton Abbey series were sensitive and illuminating.\n\nMaybe he was a fan already, but I can guess what may have inspired Fellowes to get so giddy about the royals to the point that he turned his film into a piece of monarchist idolatry. There was the on-set visit from the Duchess of Cambridge in 2015 and a tribute by Prince William, who said it was \u201cone of Catherine\u2019s and my favourite programmes\u201d. Even the cast have royal links \u2013 Harry Hadden-Patten, who plays Lady Edith\u2019s husband Bertie Pelham, is Sarah Ferguson\u2019s godson. Jim Carter, who stars as the butler, Carson, received an OBE from the Queen this year for services to drama while his wife, Imelda Staunton, got a CBE in 2016 (she also stars in the film). Fellowes is surely angling for a knighthood by now.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Rex Features\n\nWhile the series attracted its own accusations of fawning over the aristocracy, the movie is so saccharine that it\u2019ll make your teeth rot. In fact, there\u2019s so much curtsying and simpering that it\u2019s a wonder the characters get anything done. Perhaps that explains the complete lack of a real story: subplots aside (there\u2019s an entire story dedicated to a boiler being fixed), the main event is a royal visit by King George V (a bored-looking Simon Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James). News of the visit prompts Mary to ask Tom Branson (Allen Leech), an Irish Republican, if he\u2019s planning on building a bomb. Meanwhile, Daisy the cook is scolded for questioning why everyone is so excited about a bunch of strangers coming to Downton.\n\nBack in the real world, for some a dodgy boiler means choosing between starving or freezing. Unless you\u2019re the actual Queen, whose 60-year-old boiler was part of a \u00a33.1 million utility bill in 2013. To distract from revelations such as this, the establishment has an infuriating habit of wheeling out the royal family every time morale is at an ebb. Hate crimes are at an all-time high? Let\u2019s throw a royal wedding! The government\u2019s going to s*** over Brexit? Who cares, Meghan\u2019s pregnant!\n\nAnd this is precisely what Downton Abbey, so beautifully timed, is also doing. When I interviewed Michelle Dockery for the film, I asked her if she felt fans would read into the (rather unsubtle) messages in the film. \u201cThere\u2019s a message that Julian puts across, perhaps,\u201d she said tactfully, echoing many other cast members by calling the film a form of \u201cescapism\u201d rather than my suggested word: \u201cDistraction\u201d.\n\nFellowes, meanwhile, couldn\u2019t be clearer. The character Tom abandons his socialist views and bows his head to the king and queen, having saved the head of state from a would-be assassin. Later, the king thanks him for persuading his daughter, Princess Mary, to stay in a loveless marriage with an emotionally abusive man who seems to hate his own children, because that\u2019s her royal duty. It\u2019s sickening, but Boris Johnson must be delighted, given the battering the prime minister has taken over the past week in the now-suspended parliament.\n\nDownton Abbey is subliminal messaging to the extreme: \u201cShut up and do what you\u2019re told,\u201d Fellowes seems to say of anyone who kicks off about the status quo. In a way, it mirrors his own comments in 2016, when he called Brexit a \u201cgreat opportunity\u201d but added that he didn\u2019t like when public figures \u201ctell us what to think\u201d. But really, what else is he doing in Downton Abbey but that? For all Lady Mary\u2019s talk of adapting for the future, she ultimately decides to stick with Downton Abbey, to value \u201ctradition\u201d and \u201cheritage\u201d and various other buzzwords that have, coincidentally, been thrown around by Brexiteers. At a press screening of Downton, I laughed at the final scene where the royals and the aristocrats are shown dancing round and round in circles. Because what else has our government been doing for the past three years?", "description": "People didn\u2019t watch Downton Abbey for the social commentary.
