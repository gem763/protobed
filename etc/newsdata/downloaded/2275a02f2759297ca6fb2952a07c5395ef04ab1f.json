Though the pair already had a ceremony, this one will reportedly be their larger, more Jesus-y one. All we know is that it is taking place in \u201cSouth Carolina,\u201d so that narrows it down \u2026 somewhat.\n\nLOOK AT HER HAILEY BIEBER IS GONNA BE THE MOST GORGEOUS BRIDE EVER pic.twitter.com/Epy1bBt6AG \u2014 mors loves justin (@typicalbizzzle) September 26, 2019\n\nThough the Daily Mail tells us Bieber, her sister Alaia, Kendall Jenner, and some other friends enjoyed a \u201craucous night out,\u201d it truly looks like they engaged in the most standard and hellishly boring of bachelorette fare.\n\nPhoto: @haileybieber/Instagram\n\nPhoto: @alaiabaldwin/Instagram\n\nBieber wore a white dress and a veil. There was a large goblet with the word \u201cBRIDE\u201d on it, name tags with things like \u201cBRIDE TO BE\u201d on them, and penis sippy cups, and penis straws.\n\nPhoto: @alaiabaldwin/Instagram\n\nPhoto: @stylememaeve/Instagram\n\nAgain, all of these practices and symbols will be familiar to women who have also been obligated to participate in phallus idolatry while toasting with shots of Goldschl\u00e4ger until our arms cannot even lift the slimmest of penis straws. Eventually, the night bleeds together in a bleak, wrinkled pink blur. It\u2019s somewhat comforting that even for the likes of Hailey Bieber and company, bachelorette parties remain a prison from which we may never escape.", "description": "Ahead of her wedding to Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber was thrown a bachelorette party, proving that even the stars have to endure the indignity pink plastic penises.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/26/26-hailey-baldwin.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
