He was seen at a few Hollywood comedy venues while he was with the Clippers and even made an appearance on Comedy Central in a \u201croast battle\u201d against Jeff Ross.\n\nNBA'S ADAM SILVER RESPONDS TO PENCE'S CRITICISM OF LEAGUE'S RESPONSE TO CHINA CRACKDOWN\n\nBut what makes him more nervous? Playing in front of sellout fans during high-pressure moments or trying to put on a comedy show in front of a club filled with roughly 200 guests?\n\nNBA'S TALLEST PLAYER SUFFERS CONCUSSION IN FREAK ACCIDENT\n\n\u201cDefinitely 200 people at a comedy club,\u201d Griffin said Sunday night at the Forbes Under 30 Summit at the Masonic Temple in Detroit. \u201cBasketball has been a part of my life forever, so it\u2019s sort of something that comes second nature to me.\u201d\n\nThe Detroit Pistons star was featured on Forbes\u2019 30 Under 30 feature magazine last year.

Obviously it\u2019s the same with basketball. The more time you put in, the more practice the better you be. Comedy, basketball, anything; the more genuine time you put in the more you\u2019re going to get out of it.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s 2019-20 season with the Pistons is just beginning. He missed Saturday\u2019s game with an ankle injury.", "description": "Blake Griffin is a six-time NBA All-Star and a five-time All-NBA forward who has appeared in more than 50 playoff games in 11 seasons in the league.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
