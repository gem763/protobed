It was beautiful,' he said.\n\nThis picture shows Alexei Leonov during the world's first ever space walk 10 weeks before the US\n\nSoviet cosmonauts Alexei Leonov and Valery Kubasov can be seen preparing to leave for the Apollo-Soyuz docking mission in 1975\n\nLeonov was the first astronaut to 'walk' in space. The spacewalk happens when a person leaves the ship and 'walks' above earth's atmosphere. Leonov and his ship managed this momentous feat 10 weeks before the US\n\nLeonov and another cosmonaut, pilot Pavel Belyayev, (codenames Almaz-1 and Almaz-2) were rocketed almost 310 miles into orbit.\n\nBack on the surface, millions followed the mission as it was beamed live on radio and television.\n\nThe mission was successful on the whole but the men's return to Earth nearly ended in tragedy when Leonov and Belyayev crash-landed deep in the Russian woods.\n\nThey completed man's first spacewalk 10 weeks before the United States.\n\nThe spacewalk and the crash-landing were featured in a 2017 film, the Spacewalker. Leonov, who was played by Russian movie star Yevgeny Mironov, was a consultant on the project.\n\nA decade later in 1975 Leonov commanded the Soyuz 19 in the first joint space mission between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nLeonov, who became a legend in Russia, celebrated his 85th birthday in May.\n\nCommander of the Soviet crew of the Apollo-Soyuz, Alexei Leonov (left) and commander of the US crew of Apollo, Thomas Stafford (R), shake hands after the Apollo-Soyuz docking maneuvers\n\nLeonov was a legend in Russia and earned the country's highest honour, the Hero of the Soviet Union, twice. Vladimir Putin called him a 'worthy representative of the legendary team of Soviet cosmonauts,' and he praised his 'outstanding achievements'\n\nPutin congratulated the Soviet-era cosmonaut at the time, calling him 'a worthy representative of the legendary team of Soviet cosmonauts.'\n\n'You have made a great contribution to Russian cosmonautics and have promoted its outstanding achievements,' Putin has said.\n\nLeonov's assistant Natalia Filimonova said that he died at Moscow's Burdenko hospital after a long illness.\n\n'It's a huge tragedy for us all,' said the wife of cosmonaut Boris Volynov, Tamara Volynova, who wrote a book about cosmonauts.\n\n'Alexei is a unique person,' she said.\n\nHe will be laid to rest at a memorial cemetery just outside Moscow on Tuesday, officials said.", "description": "Alexei Leonov, a Soviet cosmonaut who 'spacewalked' in 1965, has died in Moscow aged 85 after a long illness.
