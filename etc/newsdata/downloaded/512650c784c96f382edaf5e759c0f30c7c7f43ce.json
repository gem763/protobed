REUTERS/Sergio Perez\n\nStephen Barclay was speaking in Madrid just six weeks before the date on which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the European Union.\n\nBritain wants a deal to guide its relationship with its biggest trading partner after it leaves the bloc, but would leave without one if both sides cannot agree in the next 42 days, Barclay said.\n\n\u201cThe prize of a deal should focus the minds of both sides on this need for creativity and flexibility,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s work creatively to secure a deal, a deal the UK is committed to get in, a deal without a backstop ... a deal which will pass both the UK parliament and the European parliament.\u201d\n\nHe listed issues with the Irish arrangement - an insurance policy to keep open the border on the island - which made it impossible to accept, including the difficulty of guaranteeing it would be temporary.\n\nBarclay said Britain was ready to share \u201crelevant texts\u201d in negotiation, but was in no rush to comply with EU requests for specific written proposals to formalise an alternative.\n\n\u201cWhy risk crystallising an undesirable result this November when both sides can work together until December 2020?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe risk being trapped in a zero-sum game and that will lead to zero-sum outcomes.\u201d\n\nBarclay is due to meet Spain\u2019s acting foreign minister and newly appointed European foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, as well as members of the British community in Spain.\n\nMore than 300,000 Britons are registered as living in Spain, and many more have migrated without registering.\n\nBusiness ties between the two countries would also be complicated by a messy departure. Barclay said international groups like British Airways and Iberia airlines operator IAG (ICAG.MC) did not want uncertainty \u201cdragging out\u201d.\n\nBritain is ready to continue discussions about its territory of Gibraltar on Spain\u2019s southern coast, which some 10,000 Spaniards enter every day, Barclay said, adding conversation on the matter so far had been \u201cconstructive and pragmatic\u201d.\n\nThe conservative government would abide by a ruling from Britain\u2019s top judicial body, the Supreme Court, on Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks, he said.\n\nThe court is hearing legal arguments over whether Johnson acted lawfully and may decide as soon as Friday.\n\nBarclay said he will meet EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Friday.\n\n\u201cWhilst we seek a deal, we recognise we may not be able to agree a deal and in that instance we will leave with no deal,\u201d he said.", "description": "Britain's Brexit minister on Thursday urged the European Union to show flexibility and creativity in striking a deal, although he stuck to his country's position that the contentious Irish backstop arrangement must go.", "authors": ["Isla Binnie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431520802&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0GK", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
