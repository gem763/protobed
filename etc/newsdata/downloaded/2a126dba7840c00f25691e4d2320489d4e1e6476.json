He established his company six years ago with offices in the United States and China.\n\nLiu has given the screen a poetic name, Cicada's Wings, to highlight its light weight, flexibility and durability.\n\nAccording to Liu, the screen was developed solely by his team and contains more than 20 million flexible high-precision devices, bendy integrated circuits and nearly 100 micro and nano structured thin film materials.\n\nLiu said his team had run tests on the screen for around three years and owned more than 2,000 intellectual property rights.\n\nExperts previously told Wire that flexible screens were more resilient and durable than glass-fronted touchscreen displays used in most current smartphones.\n\nFoldable screens cannot be broken when they are dropped and are also lighter and cheaper to produce.\n\nBill Liu, the 35-year-old founder and CEO of Royole, unveils FlexPai in Beijing on Wednesday\n\nAn interested customer try to play with the bendy smartphone during its launch in Beijing\n\nThe launch of FlexPai has caught many industry observers by surprise.\n\nIt had been widely speculated that Samsung or Huawei would be the first company to launch a foldable phone.\n\nDJ Koh, Samsung's mobile CEO, previously told CNBC that such a device was in the works, adding that the company was trying to differentiate the experience from a tablet once it is unfolded.\n\nThe Korean tech giant is expected to hold a developer conference in San Francisco next Wednesday that could give the public a preview of the technology.\n\nHuawei CEO Richard Yu said in September that the Chinese company was working on developing a phone with a foldable display, adding that it would be out within the next year. The new phone would also support super-fast 5G network speeds.\n\nFlexPai was also released as Chinese smartphone users switch their focus from cheap prices to high quality and more eye-catching designs.\n\nAccording to a new report released by Internet Data Centre, around 105 million smartphones were sold in China in the second quarter of this year.\n\nAlthough the figure is a 5.9 per cent decrease from the same period last year, consumers expressed desire to buy handsets with newer technology they had not seen before.", "description": "The FlexPai is billed as the world's first foldable smartphone by its developer Royole and has a super  flexible  screen which can be bent from the middle.", "authors": ["Tracy You", "Kelsey Cheng For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/02/16/5695962-0-image-a-43_1541176915003.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-02"}
