God help me if in our dressing room someone mentioned can we finish fourth as a great achievement, you'd have been lynched.'\n\nRoy Keane slammed Man United's lowered expectations of a fourth place finish this season\n\nThe former United captain has been vocal in expressing his disapproval at the club's dramatic fall from grace in recent years, and once again was on hand to share his divisive opinions about the Old Trafford outfit.\n\nKeane also raised doubts over the top flight giants' recruitment policy, but believes that the club's young prospects should be allowed the opportunity to prove themselves.\n\nHe added: 'I think they've made a number of mistakes over the last few years regarding recruitment no doubt and I think they had to go down that road. It's so early in the season, I think we've got to give these lads a chance to mature at the club.\n\nKeane raised doubts over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the United's recruitment policy this summer\n\n'The only concern I'd have with the three players that came in is the clubs they came from, they're not used to winning week in, week out like what you'd expect from a Man United player.\n\n'You also hope the senior players will give them a helping hand and I've had doubts about that for a number of years.\n\n'They had to go down that road. A bit younger, obviously Maguire's not that young, but hungry players.\n\n'Ole (Gunnar Solskjaer) had to make these changes but only time will tell if they're going to work. The way they've started the season\u2026 the jury's still out.'\n\nFormer Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho also featured in Sky's coverage of the meeting at the London Stadium.\n\nThe Portuguese tactician revealed his belief that United would be unable to push higher than a fourth place finish this season, adding: 'I think they will finish between fourth and sixth.\n\nJose Mourinho believes United will be unable to finish higher than fourth spot this season\n\n'That's my point of view and I don't think they are a team capable of fighting for the top two, of course.\n\n'I think it would be a good achievement for them to finish top four and to be back in the Champions League. It's very important for everybody to share and agree with the club's objectives.\n\n'If internally the objective is to finish top four and build from there and not at all the team thinking this season about fighting for the title then I think it is a perfect environment to try to bring some young players and to try to build something for the future.'", "description": "The outspoken Irishman, making his punditry debut for Sky Sports, believes that players would have been heavily criticised in the dressing room for settling for anything less than a title challenge.", "authors": ["Daniel Davis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/22/14/18785282-0-image-a-29_1569158482725.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
