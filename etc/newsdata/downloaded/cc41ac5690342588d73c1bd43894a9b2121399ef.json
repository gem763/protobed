We've had several sponsor and fan interaction events and the response, while often chaotic, is overwhelming.\n\nEspecially because we have some of the genuine stars of the game in our side.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore have not reached the knock-out stage of the competition\n\nThe big disappointment is that we won only two of our 13 group games which nobody, myself included, expected but that's just how sport goes sometimes.\n\nThe level of competition is so strong and every team is packed with superstars so there really is no such thing as an easy game.\n\nOnce you get on a bad run of form, as we obviously did, it's hard to get out of. One thing I must say however is the support we received from the fans and everyone associated with the franchise was unwavering.\n\nEvery match was sold out and we never once received a stern word from those above which has been the case with other franchises I have been involved with.\n\nWhile I was only able to play in five (hopefully six) matches out here I am pleased with how I have performed and felt like I was growing into the tournament nicely which bodes well for my confidence if I get picked up again next year.\n\nMills is looking forward to returning home in time for England's summer T20 fixtures\n\nThis concludes my winter of cricket where I have played over 30 T20 matches in five countries since November. I've been extremely lucky as I've got to travel all over the world, meeting some great people and seeing some amazing places along the way.\n\nI feel my cricket has improved immensely as playing against the best players in the world consistently forces you to be on your game at all times otherwise you just don't survive.\n\nI am now looking forward to having some time off, catching up with friends and family and letting my body recover. I'll still be watching the remainder of the IPL as I'll be commentating on the final for Sky a week on Sunday!\n\nEngland began their summer schedule with a one-day international series win over Ireland\n\nNext up for me cricket wise are hopefully three T20i's against South Africa at the end of June, if selected, which will be a great challenge and then I'm really looking forward to pulling my Sussex shirt back on and playing in the T20 Blast.\n\nThe boys have made a good start in the 50 over competition so hopefully it's the beginning of a great summer.\n\nThat's it from me! I hope you've enjoyed my ramblings and I hopefully I've given you an insight into life at the IPL through the ups and downs. Thank you for reading.
