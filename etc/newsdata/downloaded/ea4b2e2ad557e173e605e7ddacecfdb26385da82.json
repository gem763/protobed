That\u2019s because it\u2019s taking the wellness world by storm.\n\nToday you can get lattes, chocolates, oils, and lotions infused with the stuff, and you\u2019ll find users online regularly championing the benefits of this hemp extract.\n\nWhile already popular in the States and Europe, it\u2019s now slowly but surely creeping into the Japanese market. But like anything that comes from the hemp plant, there\u2019s still a bit of ambiguity about what CBD is, what it does, and its legal status here, in a nation with very strict anti-marijuana laws.

In general, the ECS plays a significant role in the regulation of many of our crucial human functions, including sleep, stress, appetite, mood, memory, and even reproduction and fertility.\n\nWhile a cannabinoid can be manufactured artificially, CBD is naturally occurring, and it\u2019s a safe, non-addictive substance. It\u2019s closely linked to THC, the compound in marijuana that makes you high. Both compounds have been found to have relaxation and mood-elevating effects (from higher levels of dopamine), though those effects can vary from person to person.
