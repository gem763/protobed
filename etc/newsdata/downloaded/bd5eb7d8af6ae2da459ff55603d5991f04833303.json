California\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good for the sport of boxing,\u201d Fury told Seconds Out.\n\n\u201cFor non-sporting people who are very famous in their own right, it brings new fans, new attention.\n\n\u201cTwo computer guys are topping the bill at Staples Centre with world champions on their undercard.\n\n\u201cTwo guys who\u2019ve never had a fight before professionally, making their pro debuts, are probably going to sell out Staples Centre!\n\n\u201cI hear that Devin Haney is going to be on the undercard who is a great prospect, and Billy Joe Saunders who is a two-division world champion, plus many more as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic for boxing because they\u2019ve both got millions of followers, I don\u2019t know how many followers Logan Paul has got but lots and so has KSI. It\u2019s unbelievable actually.\n\n\u201cI hope they earn plenty of money and get paid well for it because they\u2019ve got plenty more followers than most people in boxing.\u201d\n\nOn reports it\u2019s making a mockery of the sport, Fury disagreed strongly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Anyone who can spread exposure on boxing and sell it to millions of people and subscribe, tune in, it\u2019s a fantastic job.\u201d\n\nOn who will win the rematch, Fury had an answer.\n\n\u201cI fancy Logan Paul to beat him. The first was a close one but he\u2019s going to learn from his mistakes and train harder this time.\u201d", "description": "Tyson Fury fights for the second time in 2019 this weekend when he faces unbeaten Swedish talent Otto Wallin at his second home in Las Vegas, Nevada.
