You've got another 75 minutes to go yet.\"\n\nYesterday it was Kyle Sinckler getting the head-pat treatment, this time from Aussie hooker Tolu Latu, after conceding a free kick with an early scrum shove.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA dozen years on and the outcome was just the same. England got mad, then they got even.\n\nThere was a time not so long ago when Sinckler would have got riled, certainly had something to say to Latu.\n\nInstead, like Regan before him, he let his rugby do his talking - first with England\u2019s crucial third try, then by winning a turnover on his own line to protect the victory.\n\n(Image: MARK R CRISTINO/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\u201cThat's something I've really tried to own\u2026.my discipline and just being cool in the moment,\u201d said the Harlequins prop. \u201cThat comes with experience.\u201d\n\nLater Eddie Jones would dub Sinckler a \u201crunaway rhino\u201d. Team mate Joe Marler preferred a \u201cyoung runaway bull\u201d. Either way Australia got the gist.\n\nThey had been swept away after their strong start, dominated by Sinckler and \u2018Kamikaze Kids\u2019 Tom Curry and Sam Underhill in the most emphatic fashion.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nJonny May marked his 50th cap with two tries in two minutes at the end of the first quarter, Anthony Watson bagged an interception score and captain Owen Farrell silenced his critics by slotting all eight of his shots at goal.\n\nBut nobody contributed more than Sinckler, 26, erasing the memory of losing his rag in Cardiff in the Six Nations after being wound up by Wales boss Warren Gatland.\n\n\u201cThere have been in the past questions about Kyle\u2019s emotional energy, which is what he thrives off,\u201d said Marler. \u201cIn the Six Nations he wasn\u2019t able to control that.\n\n(Image: AFLO/Press Association Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cBut here he showed he\u2019s now fully able to do so and play on that edge, which was great to see.\u201d\n\nOf all the images to be recalled from this day on the island of Kyushu, none was more than striking than Sinckler\u2019s smile as he ran a perfect line onto Farrell\u2019s pass to score under the sticks.\n\n\u201cIt was very special,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I was knackered afterwards. That was a tough, tough Test match.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images,)\n\nIt got tougher still when Australia came again, pounding at the England line with a refusal to accept their World Cup dream was over.\n\nIt seemed they would finally breach the white defence but in the nick of time the ball popped loose, forced out of Isi Naisarani\u2019s grasp by Sinckler.\n\nNow was the time to give Sinckler a pat. But Australia had missed their cue. And paid the ultimate price.\n\nEngland - Tries: May 2, Sinckler, Watson. Cons: Farrell 4. Pens: Farrell 4.\n\nAustralia - Try: Koroibete. Con: Lealiifano. Pens: Lealiifano 3.", "description": "Eddie Jones' team win by four tries to one to set up last-four clash against New Zealand, 46-14 winners over Ireland", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Mark R Cristino Epa-Efe Rex", "Aflo Press Association Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652495.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-v-Australia-Rugby-World-Cup-2019-Quarter-Final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
