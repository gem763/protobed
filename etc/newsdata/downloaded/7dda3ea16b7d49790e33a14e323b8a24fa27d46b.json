Immediately alerting police and helping to evacuate the area before the devices could detonate, Jewell saved scores of people from death or injury and was cheered for his heroism \u2013 but that would soon change.\n\nThree days after the tragedy, Jewell found himself a suspect in the bombing, becoming a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the FBI\u2019s investigation, which profiled Jewell as a potential \u2018lone wolf\u2019 attacker. A trial by media then ensued, in which the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper led the charge in positing his role in the lethal bomb plot (one woman was killed by shrapnel and dozens injured).\n\nClint Eastwood movie on Richard Jewell and the Atlanta bombing fatally exposes the news media.\n\n\n\nSimilar what is occurring today when the American Media becomes Pravda and tries to warp the minds of the citizenry.\n\n\n\nThe very people that made this country are destroying it now \u2014 Kirby York (@KirbyYork5) October 4, 2019\n\n\u201cJewell fits the profile of the lone bomber, a frustrated white man who is a police wannabe who seeks to become a hero,\u201d Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs \u2013 portrayed by Oliva Wilde \u2013 says in Eastwood\u2019s trailer.\n\nAlso on rt.com FBI entrapped suspects in almost all high-profile terrorism cases in US\n\nThough Jewell was ultimately cleared of all suspicion by US Attorney Kent Alexander some three months after the bombing, by that time his name and reputation had been dragged through the mire.\n\nhonestly looking at his wiki page today and learning how every single news outlet stood by their coverage of him even after paying settlements.........lol yeah \u2014 Gregg Turkington's Esther vs. Dracula (@EstherOnFilm) October 3, 2019\n\nIn an effort to clear his name further, Jewell later filed a number of libel suits against media outlets that ran with the story \u2013 including NBC, the New York Post and CNN, among others \u2013 ultimately winning settlements in all but one of the cases. Several outlets still stood by their coverage, however. Jewell died in 2007.\n\nFantastic looking film, terrific cast. A timely reminder that neither the government nor the press are your friends, & they will eat you alive if it fits their version of events.\n\n\n\nRichard Jewell \u2013 Official Trailer \u2013 Warner Bros. UK https://t.co/6DviDXhS4M via @YouTube \u2014 Yancy Evans (@gallandro1) October 4, 2019\n\nFollowing Jewell\u2019s exoneration, by 1998 the prime suspect for the Atlanta bombing was Eric Rudolph, a self-avowed anti-LGBT militant. He was arrested in connection to the attack in 2003 in North Carolina, and later confessed to three other bombings on a lesbian bar and two abortion clinics.\n\nThe man who was guilty?\n\n\n\nHe went on bombing around the southeast for three entire years before he was stopped.\n\n\n\nAnd I can\u2019t help but think... had folks accepted Jewell as a hero in \u201896, then maybe Eric Rudolph would\u2019ve been caught that very same summer. \u2014 Thomas L. Strickland \u2615\ufe0f (@ThomasLS) October 3, 2019\n\nThe film, which arrives in theaters December 13, stars Paul Walter Hauser as Jewell, who appears alongside Kathy Bates playing Jewell\u2019s mother, Jon Hamm in the role of lead FBI investigator and Sam Rockwell as Jewell\u2019s lawyer.\n\nAlso on rt.com Was FBI-staged Russian \u2018honeytrap\u2019 the only \u2018deep state\u2019 anti-Trump plot?\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
