(AP) - Jimmy Garoppolo\u2019s return from a season-ending knee injury hit a few road bumps during training camp and the preseason.\n\nNow Garoppolo must face the next test in his comeback, with his first regular-season game in more than 11 months. The San Francisco 49ers visit the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the season opener Sunday.\n\nHe\u2019s eager to get back on the field for games that count after a summer of people dissecting his every throw to determine whether he could still be a franchise quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, so I\u2019m excited to get back out there,\u201d Garoppolo said Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t know, you can\u2019t really listen to all that stuff. We\u2019ve got so much going on with our stuff, mentally, physically, that you\u2019re trying to deal with all that. It\u2019s exciting to be back.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers are counting on a healthy and effective Garoppolo this season after four straight losing seasons and just 10 wins total in the first two campaigns under coach Kyle Shanahan.\n\nGaroppolo acknowledged having some physical and mental hurdles to clear during the offseason and training camp and the question remains how quickly he\u2019ll be back up to speed in the regular season.\n\n\u201cI know Jimmy can play,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you exactly how he\u2019s going to play, every single play or every single game. I know Jimmy is going to have some ups and downs, but I don\u2019t sit there and try to make a different decision based off of one practice or one preseason game and then flip the next game. Jimmy\u2019s working his way back. He\u2019s ready to go. He\u2019s as far along as he can be. I know he\u2019s confident, excited for the season, but we need Sunday to come not just for him but for all of us. We\u2019ve all been itching for this game since the season ended last year and when you\u2019re coming back from an injury I think that\u2019s even heightened for those type of players.\u201d\n\nGaroppolo was supposed to reverse the 49ers\u2019 fortunes after being acquired in the middle of the 2017 season from New England. He stepped in as the starter late in that season and won all five of his starts to end the year, earning a five-year, $137.5 million contract as the new face of the franchise.\n\nThings didn\u2019t go so smoothly the next season as Garoppolo struggled in his three starts before the injury. He completed less than 60% of his passes before the injury and saw his yards per attempt drop, while his sack and interception rates went up.\n\nHe spent his time on the sideline getting tutored in the intricacies of the offense by former NFL coach Mike Shanahan, Kyle\u2019s father, and also tinkered a bit with his mechanics during offseason sessions with quarterback guru Tom House.\n\nBut that process to get back to the form he showed late in 2017, when he was one of the game\u2019s most promising prospects, wasn\u2019t always smooth this summer. He had some rough practices, including one where he threw interceptions on five straight throws.\n\nHe then had a horrible first exhibition game in Denver, completing 1 of 6 passes for 0 yards and an interception. But he played well in his second start at Kansas City and now the Niners want to see if he can build on that when the season starts against Tampa Bay.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is (excited). Not just here, but all over America is ready to see what Jimmy Garoppolo can do,\u201d right tackle Mike McGlinchey said. \u201cWe\u2019re all really excited to see what he can do and we expect nothing but great things from him this week.\u201d\n\nNOTES: DE Nick Bosa (ankle), WR Dante Pettis (groin), C Weston Richburg (knee), CB Jason Verrett (ankle), CB K\u2019Waun Williams (knee) were all limited at practice. \u2026 LT Joe Staley got a veteran day off from practice. \u2026 WR Jalen Hurd (back) was held out and is doubtful to play this week. \u2026 WR Trent Taylor (foot) will also miss the game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jimmy Garoppolo's return from a season-ending knee injury hit a few road bumps during training camp and the preseason.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/49ers_garoppolo_football_15297_c0-181-4320-2699_s1770x1032.jpg?57cd28a37b32a07ccb294e4fb73b6cb600fac0d9"}
