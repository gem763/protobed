It\u2019s about a couple who want to have a baby. They fret that the baby will, over a lifetime, emit the weight of the Eiffel Tower in CO2 gas.\n\nCue a ferociously talky, wind-driven play for carbon-aware extinctionists.\n\nThe cast is positively regal, however. It stars Claire Foy and Matt Smith, twin jewels in The Crown (on Netflix) who played the Queen and Prince Philip. Indeed, this play put me in mind of the real prince, who on the deck of the royal yacht Britannia in Belize once shouted at the Queen, who was chatting happily: \u2018Yak, yak, yak; come on, get a move on.\u2019\n\nHere, Claire Foy effs and blinds for England. Matt Smith looks on baffled, an unsuccessful musician swamped by the sudden moody tsunami of female hormones\n\nWell, the yakking in this is epic. It starts in the queue in Ikea. He moots the idea of having a baby. She turns it into a row. There\u2019s no mention of Brexit, thank goodness: Duncan Macmillan\u2019s play was written in 2011.\n\nBut everything else going on at the moment is composted into the play\u2019s orbit of concern: recycling, population control, gender, carbon dioxide, plastic, you name it.\n\nHere, Foy \u2013 wearing dungarees \u2013 effs and blinds for England, a ball of contradictions and gabbling rant. She makes her character compelling, just occasionally even adorable such as when she\u2019s most scared by childbirth.\n\nIT'S A FACT Former Doctor Who Matt Smith was discovered by agent Wendy Padbury - once best known as the second Doctor's companion Zoe.\n\nSmith looks on baffled, an unsuccessful musician swamped by the sudden moody tsunami of female hormones. (I\u2019d forgotten what pregnancy was like: pregnant women are an uncleared minefield and the father soon learns to approach with caution and without helpful suggestions.)\n\nHowever much you want to strangle this metropolitan pair, it\u2019s impossible not be drawn in by the dizzyingly fast Formula One gear shifts as events overtake the couple.\n\nDirector Matthew Warchus even gets them to look natural on a shiny plinth, poised on what looks like a job lot of crystals from an aromatherapist\u2019s front room.\n\nThe two stars act like old mates, which offstage they are. There\u2019s true tenderness and a gasp-inducing plot twist that raises the game. But is this couple for real? Ordinary people manage to have babies without all this blather and self-doubt.\n\nIs this a satire on the gabbling absurdity of the marriage-averse, ethically sourced lifestyles of the woke middle classes? If that\u2019s what it is, then it\u2019s not merciless enough.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s these characters\u2019 utter self-absorption that\u2019s most true to our times.\n\nCurtains\n\nCardiff New Theatre Touring until April 11, 2hrs 40mins\n\nRating:\n\nKander and Ebb wrote both Cabaret and Chicago. This 2006 show was among their last, although lyricist Fred Ebb died before it was completed.\n\nIt\u2019s a murder mystery set in a 1950s Boston theatre. When the hugely untalented leading lady of a cowboy musical gets murdered, Lieutenant Cioffi \u2013 charmingly played by Jason Manford \u2013 has to find out whodunnit.\n\nThe gag is that our Columbo-ish sleuth is a smitten musical buff who\u2019s happier improving the ailing show than nailing the killer.\n\nWhen the hugely untalented leading lady of a cowboy musical gets murdered, Lieutenant Cioffi \u2013 charmingly played by Jason Manford \u2013 has to find out whodunnit\n\nRebecca Lock stands out as the hard-boiled producer, and Samuel Holmes has the best lines as the caustic English director. Of the songs, none is a classic, but What Kind Of Man? savages theatre critics with unseemly relish.\n\nChoreography (Alistair David) and direction (Paul Foster) are tight. But Curtains is overlong and never resolves the clash between a sweet, Cluedo-like backstage daftness and the profaner, Chicago-like cynicism.\n\nIt\u2019s good, though, to see a musical rarity getting such a lively outing.\n\ncurtainsmusical.com\n\nVassa\n\nAlmeida Theatre, London Until November 23, 2hrs\n\nRating:\n\nThe great proletarian Russian writer Maxim Gorky wrote this death-of-capitalism play in 1910. It\u2019s about an utterly amoral matriarch running an ailing family business. The title role is taken, splendidly, by Siobhan Redmond, standing in for the injured Samantha Bond.\n\nIcy-veined and calculating, Vassa dominates her spineless sons and hapless daughter through coercion, blackmail and sheer unmumsy scariness.\n\nTinuke Craig cleverly stages this as if it were a farce on a set with multiple doors. Mike Bartlett\u2019s adaptation is blackly funny but it\u2019s written in such a slangy, modern idiom that it elbows out all the play\u2019s vital historical context.\n\nVassa is about an utterly amoral matriarch running an ailing family business. The title role is taken, splendidly, by Siobhan Redmond, standing in for the injured Samantha Bond\n\nI emerged admiring the work of this vivid cast but wondering if Gorky hadn\u2019t been totally kicked off the stage in this vague approximation of his play.\n\nA Taste Of Honey\n\nThe Lowry, Salford Touring until February 29, 2hrs 15mins\n\nRating:\n\nIt\u2019s been 60 years since Shelagh Delaney\u2019s debut play brought an unvarnished portrait of northern working-class life to the West End .\n\nBijan\u2019s Sheibani\u2019s National Theatre production rightly puts to the fore the fraught relationship between brassy, waspish Helen and her uncherished daughter Jo. The action kicks off with them moving into a comfortless flat \u2013 all tattered sofas and naked light bulbs.\n\nHelen soon slinks off with her latest boyfriend, leaving Jo to seek support wherever she can find it \u2013 first with a sailor who leaves her pregnant, next by living with gay art student Geoff.\n\nJodie Prenger (above, with Tom Varey) struts around the stage as Helen, emphasising her character\u2019s vulgarity and the grim comedy of the lines\n\nJodie Prenger struts around the stage as Helen, emphasising her character\u2019s vulgarity and the grim comedy of the lines. Meanwhile, Gemma Dobson captures both Jo\u2019s vulnerability and determination.\n\nHowever, Delaney\u2019s litany of one-liners allow for little light and shade, and the actors by and large fail to inject this into their performances.\n\nBut the production highlights the play\u2019s wry humour, musicality and its bruising portrayal of thorny familial ties.\n\nGwendolyn Smith", "description": "Here's a play that sounds like it's been dreamt up in a vegan bicycle-repair shop.
