She did so on Sunday in a Weekend Edition Sunday interview, citing Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s (R-UT) comments that Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about investigations into Joe and Hunter Biden was \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe impeachment inquiry picks up tomorrow where it left off Friday, with a subpoena sent to a White House that\u2019s used to ignoring congressional requests, a State Department that missed its own subpoena deadline, and investigators poring over text messages between U.S. diplomats discussing what exactly the president wanted from Ukraine,\u201d host Lulu Garcia-Navarro said in introducing the reporter. \u201cJust this morning, the lawyer for the whistleblower, whose complaint is at the base of this inquiry, says he\u2019s representing another whistleblower. There are a lot of moving parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunately, NPR\u2019s Mara Liasson is here to help,\u201d Garcia-Navarro said.\n\nLiasson laid out the ongoing left-wing media narrative that Trump is in deep trouble based on the first \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint about Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, the news of a second \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d text messages between U.S. diplomats, and the upcoming testimony of a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to if Trump is losing support from Republicans, Liasson ticked off a shortlist of those who have spoken out against the president.\n\n\u201cSo far, most Republican lawmakers are sheltering in place, which is as usual with any controversy around the president,\u201d Liasson said. \u201cSome of them, like Marco Rubio, suggested that the president was kidding when he said that China should investigate the Bidens. Some of them are saying nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are a few cracks,\u201d Liasson said. \u201cBen Sasse, Susan Collins have criticized the president\u2019s action. And Mitt Romney, who has been the voice of conscience in the Senate in a mild way, said on Friday that the president\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China, which, by the way, is a communist dictatorship with no rule of law or due process, and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is, quote, \u2018wrong and appalling,\u2019\u201d Liasson said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if Romney and Ben Sasse and Susan Collins are going to be the only critical voices,\u201d Liasson said. \u201cOr is this the start of something new?\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "NPR political reporter Mara Liasson praised Sen.
