They don\u2019t want people taking their jobs. They want to have that security. And they want the wall. They want the wall.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump flavored his typical campaign speech with repeated references to Hispanics, boasting that unemployment among Hispanics was at a record low, calling attention to the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month and asserting that Hispanics love him. He asked how many in the arena were Hispanic, and a sizable share of the audience cheered in response.", "description": "The president said he had great support among Latino Americans because of his hard line on stopping migrants and drugs from crossing illegally into the U.S.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/us/politics/16dc-trump1/16dc-trump1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
