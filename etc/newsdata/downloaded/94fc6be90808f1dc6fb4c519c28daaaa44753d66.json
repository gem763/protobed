Usually they are men in high-powered jobs who want the opposite of the authority they have at work. They like handing over control by transferring money to me, and being told they are worthless, pathetic pigs. One client asked me to blackmail him by taking photos of him and then giving me the numbers of his work and wife. I told him, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay me or I\u2019ll use these photos against you.\u201d I could see that he was getting a kick out of it.\n\nMy life in sex: \u2018My partner\u2019s lover visits our place once or twice a week\u2019 Read more\n\nI\u2019ve learned to go with the flow, and nothing shocks me any more, although I refuse requests to refer to a client\u2019s race or religion. Potential clients need to send me money via PayPal first, so I know they are genuine, otherwise I could spend two hours talking to someone and not see a penny. Some buy me shoes, jewellery and lingerie.\n\nFriends and family have been supportive. But when I tell potential partners what I do, they lose interest, which is difficult. I\u2019ve been single for four years, but I\u2019m happy on my own and I won\u2019t change for anybody. I enjoy pleasing people and allowing the domineering side of my personality to come out. In daily life, I try to avoid confrontations and would never insult anyone, but as a financial dominatrix I feel empowered.\n\n\u2022 As told to Georgina Lawton\n\nEach week, a reader tells us about their sex life.
