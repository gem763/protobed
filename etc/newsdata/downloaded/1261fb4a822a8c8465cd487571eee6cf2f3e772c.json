(TSX:ER, OTCQX:EANRF) (\u201cEastmain\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce that it intends to complete a non-brokered private placement (the \u201cOffering\u201d) of common shares for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $2.0 Million. The Offering is comprised, in part, of a minimum of C$500,000 of units of the Company (\u201cHard Units\u201d) at a price of $0.12 per Hard Unit. The remaining balance will be comprised of any combination of Hard Units and flow-through shares of the Company in any combination of Quebec flow-through common shares of the Company (the \u201cQuebec FT Shares\u201d) at a price of $0.155 per Quebec FT Share, and Federal flow-through common shares of the Company (the \u201cFederal FT Shares\u201d) at a price of $0.145 per Federal FT Share.\n\nEach Hard Unit will consist of one common share of the Company and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole common share purchase warrant, a \u201cWarrant\u201d). Each Warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one common share of the Company for 2 years from the closing of the Offering (the \u201cClosing\u201d) at a price of $0.16.\n\nThe Company retains the ability to increase the size of the Offering by issuing any combination of Hard Units, Federal FT Shares and/or Quebec FT shares in such proportion as the Company may determine, exercisable at any time until 48 hours prior to closing, to cover over-allotments, if any, subject to the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.\n\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the Hard Units will be used to fund the exploration and development of the Company\u2019s Qu\u00e9bec mineral concessions and for general corporate and working capital purposes. The gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the FT Shares will be used to incur Canadian Exploration Expenses (\u201cCEE\u201d) that are \u201cflow-through mining expenditures\u201d (as such terms are defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada)) on the Company\u2019s properties in Qu\u00e9bec, which will be renounced to the subscribers with an effective date no later than December 31, 2019, in the aggregate amount of not less than the total amount of the gross proceeds raised from the issue of FT Shares.\n\nThe Offering is scheduled to close on or about October 23, 2019 and is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary regulatory and other approvals including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the securities regulatory authorities. The Company has agreed to pay a finder\u2019s fee to certain eligible registrants assisting in the Offering in an amount equal to 5% of the gross proceeds raised by such finders, which finder\u2019s fee shall be satisfied by the issuance of Hard Units to such finders at a deemed price of $0.12 per Hard Unit.\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cU.S. Securities Act\u201d), or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.\n\nAbout Eastmain Resources Inc.
