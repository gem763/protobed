Mitt Romney on Twitter Saturday, calling the 2012 Republican presidential nominee \"pompous\" a day after Romney said Trump's apparent requests of Ukraine and China to investigate a political opponent were \"wrong and appalling.\"\n\n\"Mitt Romney never knew how to win,\" tweeted Trump, who has often slammed the Utah Republican for his failure to defeat President Barack Obama.

He is a pompous \u201cass\u201d who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nTrump and his supporters have denied that his requests for foreign governments to investigate the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate were politically motivated. They have said Trump was instead focused on battling corruption.\n\n\"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\" Romney tweeted.\n\n\"By all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\" he added.\n\nExplainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\n\nWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\nBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\n\"Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics,\" Trump tweeted in response on Saturday. \"If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!\"\n\nThe president also repeated his claim that his conversation with Zelensky was a \"perfect phone call\" and that the whistleblower who helped spark the impeachment inquiry was \"way off\" in his characterization of that was said. Although many experts and commentators have said a rough transcript of the call that was released by Trump helps corroborate the allegations against him, the president also repeated his claim that the transcript exonerated him.\n\nSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nRomney has been a fierce critic of Trump since the 2016 Republican primary campaign. Though Romney was not a candidate that year, he was a leading voice among Republicans who hoped to stop Trump from securing the nomination, calling him a \"phony\" and a \"fraud\" whose \"personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.\"\n\nTrump responded to that criticism by calling Romney a \"failed candidate\" who \"ran one of the worst races in presidential history\" and \"choked like a dog.\"\n\nFailed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big \"R\" win! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2016\n\nMitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2016\n\nTheir relationship improved after Trump's 2016 victory and Romney was considered a top contender for secretary of state as Trump assembled his Cabinet. And Trump backed Romney in his 2018 Senate run, tweeting that he would \"make a great Senator\" and that he \"had my full support and endorsement.\"\n\n.@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2018\n\nBut ahead of his swearing-in as senator, Romney wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post that said, \"the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\"\n\n\"Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast!\" Trump responded. \"Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn\u2019t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!\"\n\nAs to whether Romney \"begged\" for that endorsement, the former Massachusetts governor did boast about the president's support in a 2018 tweet.\n\nHowever, Trump had relatively low popularity in Utah where he only received about 14% of the vote in the 2016 Republican caucuses, according to The New York Times. And though Trump won Utah with 45% of the vote in the 2016 general election, 21% of voters went with independent candidate Evan McMullin, who ran as a conservative alternative to Trump. Romney won the state with almost 73% of the vote in 2012.\n\nPerilous times for Trump: By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/05/trump-calls-mitt-romney-pompous/3879564002/", "description": "\"The President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\" Romney said on Friday.", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Published P.M.
