He seemed to be quite enjoying his day but he was just launching the parcels up into the back of the van.'\n\nA delivery man for Hermes was captured flinging parcels gracefully into the back of his van in Hornchurch, Essex, on October 15. He has since been sacked 'due to his failure to abide by the strict handling standards we insist upon'\n\nHe decided to film the driver after noticing his careless behaviour before - which he claims shows the driver was 'quite happy breaking people's s***' a couple of times a week.\n\nIn the clip, the driver gracefully stretches his arm to the sky and flings parcels into the back of his van as though he is spinning a partner practising for a Strictly dance routine.\n\nHe then skips over to the collection point and opens a draw and seems to take a parcel which looks similar to a box of shoes.\n\nMoments later, he lobs it side-ways through the van's back door.\n\nThe Hermes driver glances over for a moment and unfolds his arm to sling another package inside the truck and glides back to the collection point.\n\nAt the end of the footage Stephen, 51, offers some consolation to Hermes customers and quips 'look at the bright side - at least your stuff is getting f**ked up in style'.\n\nStephen said: 'Everybody is shocked. [Locals on Facebook] said they're all angry because it explains why all their sh*t has been broken.\n\nHe pranced across the pavement as he aimed packages into the back, in the clip filmed by Stephen Nichols who works in a vape shop opposite. Stephen said: 'at least your stuff is getting f**ked up in style'\n\nStephen says everyone is 'shocked' by the delivery man's behaviour and says it 'explains why all their sh*t has been broken'\n\n'We've all had a delivery where what you've ordered is beaten to death and broken and bits missing where it's fallen out of a knackered box.'\n\nStephen Nichols (pictured) said the most shocking part was not receiving an official response from Hermes\n\nSince the dad-of-three's video went viral on social media he said the driver contacted him and claimed he lost his job.\n\nStephen said he tagged Hermes in his posts but has received no official response.\n\nHe said he was approached by the driver for the original clip.\n\nHe said the man was 'very polite' about it and claimed the parcels were 'only clothes'.\n\nDespite the video reaching almost 17,000 views, the cameraman has received no official response from Hermes, according to Stephen.\n\nA Hermes spokesperson confirmed the agency driver is no longer working for the company 'due to his failure to abide by the strict handling standards we insist upon'.\n\nThey said the decision was taken immediately after watching the video.", "description": "A delivery driver has been sacked after a video emerged of him flinging parcels into the back of his van in Hornchurch, Essex, on October 15.
