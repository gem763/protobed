Here it was youth - initially at least.\n\nElliott\u2019s first ever Anfield outing began with a rather humbling experience which saw him concede possession to Ozil with a sloppy pass, and soon after the ball had beaten Caoimhin Kelleher due to Martinelli\u2019s finish from Ainsley Maitland-Niles\u2019 cross.\n\nThe strike was the Brazilian\u2019s second of the game after he had smashed an effort into the roof of the net after some poor keeping from Kelleher, which saw two goals from one Carabao Cup game become four in two.\n\nBut as it so often does football has a way of clawing back at you when you least expect it, and it was Elliott who was the instigator of the blemish the Brazilian left on the game, stepping inside the Brazilian before the 18-year-old trod on his toes.\n\nYet experience can stumble at the same hurdle as youth, as James Milner proved by making no mistake from the spot, but then gifting Arsenal a fourth with a poor backpass which was complemented by a delightful flick from Ozil.\n\nThe Carabao Cup may be the least glamorous domestic reward, but it is still capable of producing golden and bizarre moments in equal measure.\n\nMesut Ozil has staked a claim for a Premier League role\n\nAmongst the hectic, fast-paced nature of the tie at Anfield, there was always one point of calm, as it was called this evening, for Arsenal.\n\nMesut Ozil\u2019s languid style can at times be misinterpreted as a performance lacking in effort, but at Anfield it was exactly what a more youthful Arsenal side required.\n\nHe was instrumental of not only playing the delicate final ball as evidenced by Maitland-Niles\u2019 goals, but also breaking up play to trigger attacks, which Martinelli benefited from.\n\nPut simply, Ozil provided impetus, not just creativity, in the final third for the 65 minutes - something that has been lacking not only from Emery\u2019s men in the Premier League, but also at times during the German\u2019s career.\n\nBut here was a stark reminder that 31-year-old still has plenty to offer the Gunners - even if his substitution for Matteo Guendouzi was premature.\n\nJurgen Klopp still searching for Fabinho alternative\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s first Anfield start against his former club was full of the potential that many had expected him to fulfil at the Emirates, with creativity in the first half supplanted by an eye-opening second-half screamer that may have topped his second goal in Genk.\n\nIt was a strike that in most games would have claimed the highly-coveted goal of the game award, especially in a thriller such as the tie this evening, but for Joe Willock\u2019s arrowed effort.\n\nBut what goal fests also highlight are the deficiencies of both sides\u2019 defensive units, and while Arsenal\u2019s have been well-documented, Liverpool\u2019s emerged from Fabinho\u2019s absence and Adam Lallana's discomfort in a deeper role.\n\nThe hosts lacked an enforcer to stem the flow of attacks from Arsenal - allowing Ozil to roam freely and have a destructive impact on Liverpool\u2019s Carabao Cup hopes, and Willock to run free before unleashing a fantastic effort past Kelleher\n\nLiverpool may already have conceded at least three goals at home this month when Red Bull Salzburg were the visitors and nearly pulled off a miracle comeback, but the five goals they conceded at the back end of this month have confirmed that Klopp still has work to do to keep things tights in midfield when he chooses to rest the Brazilian.\n\nDivock Origi rescued Liverpool on this occasion with two well-taken goals, and despite their recent history which suggests otherwise, Klopp faces a test to find a midfield combination which exhibits his side's best football while demonstrating a determined rearguard action.", "description": "Shkodran Mustafi\u00a0will struggle to turn around\u00a0Arsenal's leaky defence Unai Emery has made it crystal clear since the summer that Shkodran Mustafi is no longer in his plans for Arsenal\u2019s Premier League outings.
