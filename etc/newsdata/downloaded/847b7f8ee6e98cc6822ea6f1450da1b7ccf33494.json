In fact, according to Fidelity Investments, through the end of the third fiscal quarter 2019, \"tech\" stocks set the hottest pace of any sector in the market, rising 27% year to date, beating out consumer discretionary stocks (22%), industrials (21%), and real estate (20%), too.\n\nSo how do you find the next hot tech stock to buy? One way might be to screen for stocks expected to grow their earnings strongly over the next five years, enjoying \"strong buy\" ratings from analysts in general, and endorsed by analysts at major investment banks in particular, such as megabanker Morgan Stanley. In today's column, we'll examine three such stocks highlighted with use of TipRanks' Stock Screener:\n\nVonage: 52% Upside\n\nAccording to TipRanks' screener, the consensus on Wall Street is that Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) provider Vonage (VG - Get Report) is a \"strong buy\" for investors. Last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall initiated coverage of the stock with an \"equal-weight\" rating.\n\nBut Marshall might as well have said \"buy\" -- because this analyst thinks Vonage stock, currently at $11 and change, could zoom ahead to $15 within a year, delivering 35% profits to new investors. (To watch Marshall's track record, click here)\n\nVonage's 395-times-earnings valuation today doesn't exactly look cheap. It's hard to imagine why investors would pay 35% more than that to own a stock where earnings declined 45% last quarter. On the other hand, though, Vonage's sales increased a respectable 15% last quarter, and most analysts agree that earnings will soon follow suit, averaging 12.5% annual growth over the next five years.\n\nLending support to that view, Vonage's free cash flow is already positive -- decidedly so, with nearly $65 million generated over the last year, or nearly 10x reported GAAP profits. Marshall cites the company's \"leveraged ... cash flow\" as a reason to like the business, and says he sees \"significant value\" in the stock from a sum-of-the-parts perspective.\n\nAll in all, most analysts on Wall Streets are out rooting for Vonage to be a winning stock pick, as TipRanks analytics showcase VG as a Strong Buy. Based on 5 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 4 rate a Buy on Vonage stock while 1 says Hold.

Rated \"overweight\" in a separate initiation last month, Poly wins points from Morgan Stanley for its \"unique\" ability to help corporations transition to running their communications over the cloud by providing the equipment needed to do this.\n\nLike Vonage, Poly is a company that seems ugly on the outside, but gets better the closer you look. Trailing-12-month earnings are negative, but at the same time as Poly has been reporting GAAP losses, the stock generated about $65 million in positive free cash flow, and non-GAAP \"pro forma\" income is also positive.\n\nMarshall is looking for Plantronics to accelerate sales to \"cloud exposed businesses,\" which make up about 50% of revenue at present, and sees this as a \"next 1-2 years\" process, during which time Poly may exceed consensus expectations for 12% annualized earnings growth. Already, the analyst says the stock is cheap enough to own \"at 6x EV/EBITDA and 5x P/E.\" Over the next three years, Marshall sees the stock growing its earnings by a total of 47%.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Tech stocks are doing great in 2019.
