He even told reporters that he would try to come up with a precise estimate of his projected losses.\n\nTrump raved repeatedly about what a great time he was having, apparently relishing the chance to refute media assertions that he was increasingly isolated.\n\nStill, Trump's enthusiasm, for the just-finished G7 in France and for serving as host in Miami, highlighted French President Emmanuel Macron's success in averting the sort of major conflict or blow-up that has marred other international gatherings in recent years, including the 2018 G7 in Quebec, and a NATO leaders' summit a month later in Brussels.\n\nMacron emerged triumphant from this weekend's proceedings, largely by playing to Trump's interests and ego throughout, essentially adopting an approach of keeping his friends close and Trump closer. Macron was waiting for Trump at his hotel when the American arrived on Saturday, immediately putting him center-stage for a one-on-one lunch.\n\nAnd he kept Trump close at hand, literally and figuratively, for the next 48 hours, right up until a rare joint news conference late Monday afternoon. In between, Macron took a gamble by inviting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to attend meetings on the sidelines of the summit \u2014 but not before consulting Trump. And while Trump fired off some of his trademark raging invective against journalists, calling American reporters \"disgusting\" in one Twitter post, he did not turn any of that venom on his fellow leaders, as he had before and after the Quebec summit.\n\nInstead, Trump raved repeatedly about what a great time he was having, apparently relishing the chance to refute media assertions that he was increasingly isolated on the world stage. Of course, it was mostly an alternate reality of Trump's own making. From a policy perspective, Trump continues to stand apart \u2014 disagreeing with his fellow leaders on trade matters, on climate policy, on the Iran nuclear deal and on Russia.\n\nWhile most of the G7 leaders said they adamantly oppose readmitting Russian President Vladimir Putin to the club, citing Russia's military intervention in Ukraine and its illegal annexation of Crimea, Trump happily told reporters that he is seriously considering inviting Putin to next year's summit.\n\n\u201cIt would be better to have Russia inside the tent than outside the tent,\u201d Trump said at the news conference, after Macron had left him alone to spar with the White House press corps, which the president did with his usual gusto.\n\n\u201cWould I invite him? I would certainly invite him,\" Trump said, though he acknowledged Putin might likely turn down the offer to come as a guest rather than as a fully readmitted member of the G8.\n\nTrump quickly pivoted from Russia to denigrating his predecessor, repeating his old assertions that Barack Obama is to blame for the annexation of Crimea and had been \"outsmarted\" by Putin.\n\nBut in his appearances with Macron, Trump was all smiles.\n\nHe repeatedly congratulated the French president for a successful summit and thanked him for his \"leadership.\" Indeed, their joint news conference ended with Trump acknowledging his wife Melania's love of French wine, even as he ducked a question about his previous threats to impose U.S. tariffs on French wine and other EU products.\n\nThere is little doubt that some of them will be hoping that the G7 next year in Miami is Trump's last.\n\nIn Sicily, two years ago, leaders were content to end the summit with a communiqu\u00e9 that showcased a rare disagreement among the seven economic powers \u2014 the result of Trump's unwillingness to join the rest of the group in their commitment to the Paris accords on climate change.\n\n\"There were fears: Would he attend the G7?\" one senior EU official said at the time, noting that Trump's election had called into question \"the entire Western architecture, post Second World War.\"\n\n\"Now he's here,\" the official said with evident relief. \"He engages.\"\n\nOf course, over time leaders have learned that engaging with Trump is often painful. And there is little doubt that some of them will be hoping that the G7 next year in Miami is Trump's last. The U.S. presidential election will take place just a few months later in November.\n\nThis year, Macron gave up on the idea of producing a joint G7 communiqu\u00e9 in part to prevent Trump from sabotaging the final statement. Instead, Macron produced a one-page set of conclusions that other leaders, including Trump, endorsed. And he claimed victory, saying action is more important than some wordy policy document.\n\nIn fact, the bare-bones statement left much uncertainty. It declared the leaders' shared commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. But it is far from clear that Macron would be able to organize a meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani aimed at ending the tensions that have worsened since Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear accord.\n\nStill, preventing Trump from upending the summit was hardly just an academic exercise or short term PR win. The G7 were able to take action or issue statements on several lower-profile issues that diplomats had worked on quietly for months, like security in the Sahel region, economic and digital l development in Africa, and gender equity.\n\nSome Trump aides had expressed anger that these issues were being raised at all, and at times U.S. officials skipped meetings where these matters were discussed, just as Trump skipped the session on climate change at the leaders\u2019 summit.\n\nStill, that leaders were able to take modest steps without being stymied by Trump was hailed by some, including European Council President Donald Tusk, as a notable achievement under the current diplomatic circumstances.\n\nUnder difficult circumstances, G7 discussed and achieved progress on some of the biggest challenges of the world incl. the Amazon rainforest, trade, Iran, Hong Kong and inequalities. #G7Biarritz pic.twitter.com/efun7HCUTe \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) August 26, 2019\n\nTrump used the news conference to repeat some of his threats of force against Iran, and he showed no inclination to back away from the economic sanctions that he has reimposed as a way of drawing the Iranians to the negotiating table.\n\nOn climate change, the leaders didn't even attempt to come up with any new ambitious joint effort, settling instead for a plan to create a \u20ac20 million fund to help fight fires in the Amazon. And the leaders appeared to make very little progress in easing trade tensions that Trump has inflamed across the globe, including in his escalating trade war with China.\n\nMacron, speaking at his own news conference after parting from Trump with a big hug, said the secret to working successfully with his American counterpart is to focus on direct, personal, one-on-one interactions. Some of those interactions over the weekend had left Trump administration officials criticizing Macron even as their boss was praising him.\n\nIn any event, Trump appeared to leave Biarritz happy, tweeting \"THANK YOU FRANCE.\"\n\nBefore taking off, however, he put in a strong plug for his Doral resort as next year's summit site. And just as there is no way for other leaders to stop Trump from inviting Putin, there is no way for them to stop Trump from holding the event at his own hotel. Their only recourse would be to boycott \u2014 precisely what they feared Trump would do in 2017.\n\n\u201cWith Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows, they each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants, it's like such a natural,\u201d Trump said, while noting that a final decision has not been made.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn't have to do the work that they've done here \u2014 and they've really done a beautiful job. And what we have also is Miami and we have many hundreds of acres so that in terms of parking, in terms of all of the things that you need, the ballrooms are among the biggest in Florida and the best, it's brand new.\"\n\nThe 2019 U.N.
