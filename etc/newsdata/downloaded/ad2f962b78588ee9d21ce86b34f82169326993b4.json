In her post, she explained that she and the other regularly scheduled employees spent all week cleaning the store for the show, only to be intentionally hidden once the cameras arrived.\n\nHer post has garnered a lot of attention and now has more than 2,500 shares.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Lifestyle, Alvarado explains that once the cameras arrived, a manager called her over and allegedly said \u201cthey don\u2019t want [you] over here, so go to the back,\u201d without specifying the origin of the orders. She shared her experience with Philadelphia Magazine as well, saying that she was \u201ctold to go to the back of the store by [Old Navy managers] involved with the production,\u201d adding that \u201cabout six of my fellow co-workers were there, and we were shooed away from the camera as they filmed with these outside employees.\u201d\n\nA second employee, Marjorie Williams, tells Yahoo Lifestyle she had a similar experience.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to see the new employees on the day of the filming that morning after working late nights and early mornings to clean the store,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. Williams says the employees she was familiar with were in the basement when she came in that day and she, like many others during filming, was assigned unusual tasks like \u201cwiping down a register\u201d that hadn\u2019t been used in a year, taking out the trash and being told to \u201cdust something as if I were maintenance.\u201d (Old Navy denied these claims).\n\nView photos Old Navy clothing store in Queenstown, MD on July 26, 2019.

That is completely inaccurate and against the values we stand for as a company.\u201d", "description": "New details emerge as Yahoo Lifestyle speaks to black Old Navy employees who are accusing the store of discrimination during a taping of Netflix's \"Queer Eye.\"", "authors": ["Kamilah Newton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dX3iEK.KU5LB9xmkv957YQ--~B/aD0yODM0O3c9NDYyMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/42c4e160-cad3-11e9-95ff-58ad2b20def6", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
