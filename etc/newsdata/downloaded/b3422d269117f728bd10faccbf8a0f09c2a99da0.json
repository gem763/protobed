Mr Enzanga was beaten up during the course of his activities street dealing.'\n\nHe asked that Enzanga's relative youth be taken into account when passing sentence, telling the court that he was just 19 when the offence took place.\n\nA carrier bag containing 60 wraps of crack cocaine or heroin was left at the fight scene\n\nMr Frymann called for his client to receive a determinate sentence, rather than one extended by an official finding of dangerousness under the law.\n\n'Here is someone who is so young that the court should not make a final decision about whether he is and/or will be dangerous in future where so much changes or is capable of changing in a young person's life.'\n\nJudge Hetherington sentenced him to 16 years in prison, with a further four years on licence.\n\nHe must serve at least two thirds of the 16 years before he is eligible for parole.\n\nJudge Hetherington told Enzanga: 'You were no innocent dupe, you were already an experienced criminal as your convictions show.\n\nPolice released this photograph of drugs that were recovered at the scene after the stabbing\n\n'You knew exactly what you were about. In order to escape (you) took out your knife and plunged it twice in the back of Pc Turner.'\n\nHe blasted Enzanga for his 'hopeless attempt' to evade justice in the face of 'overwhelming evidence' at trial.\n\n'You would stop at nothing in order to save your own skin.'\n\nAddressing the issue of dangerousness under the law, Judge Hetherington said that Enzanga poses a 'high risk of serious harm, especially to police officers'.\n\nPolice are pictured at the scene near a children's adventure park in Portsmouth in February\n\n'You are still quite young in age but in my judgment that did not affect your responsibility for this offence.'\n\nFollowing the sentencing Russell Turner said: 'On the day this happened, Pc Clare Parry and I went on patrol in Stamshaw Park with two objectives: firstly to find and safeguard who we thought was a vulnerable young man and secondly to protect the local community. Neither of us expected to get stabbed.\n\n'Stamshaw Park should be a nice place to walk the dog, take the children to or just to go for a walk in, it shouldn't be a place where someone thinks that it is all right to deal drugs and carry a knife, and on that day in broad daylight during half term.\n\n'Clare and I have been beat officers for a long time and have always listened to and tried to respond to what our communities are telling us.\n\nPolice Constable Russell Turner was stabbed when he was looking into reports of drug dealing\n\n'We are not unique in this and police officers do care and want to make the communities in which they work safer places for the public. That's what we were trying to do.\n\n'That community has been fantastic in supporting us and assisting so brilliantly with the investigation, and for that I will be eternally grateful.\n\n'I also want to say thank you for the support my family and I have had from colleagues and members of the public during what has been a very difficult time for us. It has helped immensely.\n\n'I have now left Hampshire Constabulary, partly because of this incident, and want to pass on my best wishes to everyone and hope you all stay safe.'\n\nPolice officers are pictured next to a van near the park in the Hampshire city after the attack\n\nHampshire Constabulary Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said there are 19 assaults on her staff every week, on average.\n\n'Police officers and staff are regularly subjected to violence and threats which too often result in injury.\n\n'It is never acceptable to assume that assaults upon police officers and staff should be tolerated, it is not simply 'part of the job'.\n\n'We have a duty to protect the public, but we are all too often prevented from doing so due to violent individuals who choose to attack those who are there to help them.'", "description": "Michael Enzanga was likened to a 'caged animal fighting for his life' as he repeatedly knifed Hampshire Police constable Russell Turner, 56, at Stamshaw Park in Portsmouth.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19494752-0-image-a-120_1570630270662.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
