Trump\u2019s attorneys \u201care evaluating all appellate options,\u201d Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer for Trump, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile we are reviewing the court\u2019s lengthy decision, as well as Judge Rao\u2019s dissent, we continue to believe that this subpoena is not a legitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative authority,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nU.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said the ruling was a \u201cfundamental and resounding victory for Congressional oversight, our Constitutional system of checks and balances, and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe subpoena is part of Democrats\u2019 broader efforts to gather information about the Republican president\u2019s finances.\n\nThe committee said it needed the records to determine if Trump \u2014 whose business interests have ranged from real estate and golf courses to a reality TV show \u2014 complied with laws requiring disclosure of his assets, and to assess whether those laws need to be changed.\n\nWhile campaigning for the presidency in 2016, Trump broke with a decades-old convention of candidates releasing their tax returns publicly.\n\nTrump sued the House panel in April, arguing that its subpoena exceeded limits on Congress\u2019s investigative power.\n\nTrump said the true motive for the subpoena was to expose private financial information \u201cwith the hope that it will turn up something that Democrats can use as a political tool against the President.\u201d\n\nA judge ruled against Trump in May, saying the documents might assist Congress in passing laws and performing other core functions.\n\nThe May decision was the first time a federal court waded into the tussle about how far Congress can go in probing Trump and his business affairs, and marked an important victory for House Democrats.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs for campaign travel to Minnesota from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe president is separately trying to prevent New York state prosecutors from obtaining eight years of his tax returns from Mazars. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is seeking the returns as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nTrump has argued in that case that, as a sitting president, he is immune from being criminally investigated. The federal appeals court in Manhattan is expected to hear arguments in the case on Oct. 23.\n\nTrump is also fighting subpoenas by House committees seeking his financial records from Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp, though those records do not include his tax returns. The same Manhattan appeals court has yet to rule in that case.", "description": "In a blow to President Donald Trump's efforts to block oversight of his business dealings, a U.S. court on Friday backed a House of Representatives request for the Republican's financial records including tax documents.", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439720582&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1F8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
