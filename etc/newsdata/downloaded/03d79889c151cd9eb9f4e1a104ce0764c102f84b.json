It directs you to other sources,\u201d reads one. \u201cThe page must contain footnotes,\u201d says another. \u201cThe footnotes must be from a reliable source,\u201d the last bullet reminds.\n\n\n\nAfter the admin\u2019s little outburst, we thought it would be appropriate to have a chat with him to discuss the misconceptions he feels so strongly about. 24-year-old Bonaventura Aditya Perdana, who goes by the name Bona, has been a Wikipedia administrator and contributor for years.\n\nWhile I expected his personality to reflect his hilarious tweets, it turns out that he\u2019s the most \u201cWikipedia\u201d guy out there: prim and proper.\n\nRegardless, we hope this interview clears things up for you, your friends, and your professors who preach that Wikipedia is an unreliable source written by trolls.\n\nVICE: Hello, Bona! What\u2019s your official role at Wikipedia? How long have you been doing it?\n\nBona: Actually, I\u2019d like to clear that up. Wikipedia isn\u2019t a company, it\u2019s an online community that aims to provide free information. All contributors are volunteers, so we don\u2019t get paid.\n\nAt Wikipedia, there are no titles or job descriptions, just responsibilities. For example, I\u2019m their social media administrator, so I help with administrative tasks (protecting pages, blocking users, providing users with rights to access) and promoting Wikipedia on social media. I\u2019ve been a contributor since 2012.\n\nBesides \u201cworking\u201d for Wikipedia, do you have a day job?\n\nI\u2019m a social media officer at a comic book company.\n\nProfessors often forbid their students from referencing Wikipedia. What do you and other contributors think about that? Where do you think the reluctance to cite Wikipedia originated?\n\nSo, Wikipedia\u2019s main goal from the start was to make information more widely accessible. If someone is interested in psychology, they don\u2019t have to sift through books or spend hours surfing the internet.\n\nRegarding the \u201cban\u201d on using Wikipedia as an academic source, most people don\u2019t know it\u2019s actually a viable source. All you need to do is look at the footnotes in each article. There\u2019s your source.\n\nUse the footnotes as your official citation, don\u2019t quote the Wikipedia page itself. Wikipedia is a gateway to more knowledge, and that\u2019s where the footnotes come into play. Wikipedia isn\u2019t a replacement for all the knowledge out there. Instead, it\u2019s meant to help people access information beyond the Wikipedia page.\n\nI heard that it\u2019s really easy to make a Wikipedia page. Has Wikipedia ever gotten rid of an article that wasn\u2019t accurate?\n\nThat\u2019s what administrators do every day. Wikipedia has a \u201cRecent Edits\u201d feature that shows all the activity on a certain page. Some contributors\u2019 job is to check each contribution, whether it\u2019s a new article, an edit, etc. You can find that here. Only administrators can delete articles.\n\nHow do you become an administrator or a contributor? Is there a selection process?\n\nIf you want to be a contributor, all you have to do is sign up here. Administrators, on the other hand, are chosen yearly. There\u2019s a sign-up process, a fit and proper test, and even a vote. You can see how it was done in 2019 here.\n\nHow many administrators are there across Indonesia?\n\nWe currently have 36. Here\u2019s a list of them.\n\nWhat do you think is the most common misconception about Wikipedia? Besides the assumption that it\u2019s not a viable academic source, of course.\n\nHmm, so most people ask me if Wikipedia contributors get paid. The answer is no. Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia built by volunteers. Volunteers by definition don\u2019t get paid.\n\nWikipedia stays alive thanks to the Wikimedia Foundation, which raises money every year to fund the website and other projects.\n\nAre Wikipedia contributors involved in any of those projects? Who takes charge of them?\n\nEven though we do this work voluntarily, Wikipedia still needs a unifying body to take care of the tasks volunteers can\u2019t handle. This includes legal work, server maintenance, event organizing in various countries, and the likes. The people at the Wikimedia Foundation are considered staff or employees, and they get paid. They\u2019re based in San Francisco.\n\nSince Wikipedia has so many pages, do contributors ever have a hard time figuring out what to add to a page? Or is there always something to add every day?\n\nSince we as humans learn more things every day, it\u2019s unlikely that a contributor wouldn\u2019t have information to add or update on any given day. As of now, Wikipedia Indonesia has one million registered users and around 2,000 active users. This is a lot less than the number of users on the English Wikipedia.\n\nYou speak very formally. Is it because you\u2019re representing Wikipedia?\n\nI just like writing more formally, but on Twitter I have to adjust my language to the targeted demographics. I\u2019m used to it because I\u2019ve been contributing to Wikipedia since I was in high school. In year 11, I had to memorize all the words in the dictionary.\n\nEvery word?! What kind of high school did you go to?\n\nYeah, it was weird. But it really had an impact on me moving forward. In fact, the passing grade was 80 out of 100.\n\nThanks for the chat, Bona!
