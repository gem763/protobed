Good news! The unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent, the lowest in nearly five decades. The drop, from 3.7 percent, occurred for good reasons \u2014 more people were working. The share of adults 25 to 54 who are working reached its highest level in more than 12 years.\n\nOr suppose you\u2019re a central banker who is looking for a soft landing for the economy \u2014 you want the expansion to continue but in a way that is sustainable given the United States\u2019 demographic realities. Well, the 136,000 jobs added in September are about what you want to see. Over the last six months, employers have created 154,000 net jobs per month, down from 223,000 a month during 2018, which makes sense given the ultralow unemployment rate and slowing growth in the number of working-age adults.\n\nThen again, what if you are a more pessimistic type, and think that the ostensibly strong economy is failing to reward workers, and just may be about to fall off a cliff? You have some ammunition, too!\n\nWorker pay was essentially flat in September \u2014 average hourly earnings down a penny, actually. Over the last year, average hourly earnings are up only 2.9 percent \u2014 weaker than the 3.2 percent gain reported for August and well down from the 3.4 percent rise in the year that ended in February.", "description": "Parts of the American economy are in trouble, but the unemployment rate (3.5 percent) is at a five-decade low.", "authors": ["Neil Irwin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/05/upshot/up-jobs-print/up-jobsday2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
