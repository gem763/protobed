I would like to cut back on my hours at work and leave my job in stages. My company, though, doesn\u2019t offer that option. Have you talked with people who retired from work gradually? How did they do it? Any suggestions?\n\nYou certainly aren\u2019t alone. Most employers don\u2019t have a \u201cphased retirement\u201d option for older workers, which, frankly, is shortsighted. Companies that offer such an arrangement often find that it can help with succession planning, make it easier to pass on institutional knowledge (rather than have that knowledge suddenly walk out the door), and potentially reduce costs. Retaining talent is often less expensive than hiring and training new talent.\n\nEven if your company doesn\u2019t have a phased-retirement option, managers, in many cases, seem open to considering the possibility. With that in mind, some or all of the following steps might help.\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nFinances: A reduced schedule invariably means a reduced paycheck. (And, possibly, reduced benefits.) So, first you have to ask: Am I financially able to handle a phased retirement?\n\nFlexibility: Most people think about phased retirement solely in terms of fewer hours in their current job. But why limit yourself to that approach? Perhaps there\u2019s a different job in your company that lends itself to retiring in stages. Or perhaps you can retire\u2014but do consulting work for your firm.\n\nMutual benefits: This is the most important part of the equation. You must figure out, before approaching your boss, how a phased retirement would benefit you and your employer. Perhaps the company is looking for volunteers for a project with a limited lifespan\u2014say, two or three years. Or perhaps you switch to a role where you\u2019re helping mentor or train people.\n\nTake it slowly: Most managers don\u2019t like surprises, which argues against walking into your boss\u2019s office cold and announcing: \u201cI plan to retire in a year, and I think doing that in stages helps both of us.\u201d\n\nSlow Exit Offerings of surveyed employers to help workers transition into retirement Accommodate flexible work schedules 39% Enable employees to reduce hours 31% Encourage employees to participate in succession planning, training and mentoring 27% Enable employees to take on less stressful or less demanding jobs 24% Provide information about encore careers 17% Offer retirement-oriented lifestyle and transition planning resources 16%\n\nRather, this should be a series of conversations about the future\u2014about your manager\u2019s goals and yours. Ideally, after a few talks, you can introduce some broad ideas about phased retirement and, eventually, how those ideas might mesh with your boss\u2019s needs and the company\u2019s.\n\n***\n\nOur 15-year-old daughter has earned annual income from an early age. She has saved and invested virtually all that she has earned. Is it too early to suggest starting an individual retirement account or other tax-advantaged investment vehicle?\n\nNo, it isn\u2019t too early at all. In fact, this question is a good reminder for parents and grandparents. One of the greatest financial gifts you can give a child or grandchild is an early start in saving and investing.\n\nIn this case, you could open a Roth IRA for your daughter. (Most financial institutions require a person to be 18 or older before opening an IRA on their own. So, in the short term this would be a custodial account.) The same rules and benefits that apply to adults with a Roth also will apply to your daughter: She must have earned income; contributions are limited to the lesser of her earnings for the year or $6,000 (the current contribution cap for account holders younger than 50); and withdrawals, for the most part, will be tax-free.\n\nEqually important: The contribution for the Roth can come from you, the parent (or anyone else), as long as the amount doesn\u2019t exceed the child\u2019s earnings. Let\u2019s say your daughter earns $3,000 this year. She could save that money in a traditional taxable account\u2014and you could contribute, out of your wallet, up to $3,000 to her Roth.\n\nThere are some bumps in this road. For instance, if the Roth account is small (and it may well be, at first), investment opportunities could be limited. But such drawbacks pale beside the advantages. In particular, the magic of compound interest means an account opened in a person\u2019s teens, coupled with steady contributions and prudent investments, could all but guarantee a secure financial future.\n\n***\n\nPast the age of 70, charitable contributions up to $100,000 from an IRA directly to a charitable institution can be applied against an account holder\u2019s required minimum distribution. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, this feature applies only to IRAs. Why doesn\u2019t it also apply to 401(k)s and 403(b)s, since they, too, are retirement accounts and have required withdrawals? Is this just one of those inconsistent governmental rules? Will this inconsistency be addressed?\n\nThe topic here is qualified charitable distributions, or QCDs.\n\nIn short, a QCD is a tax break. If a person (age 70\u00bd or older) transfers funds directly from an IRA to a qualified charity, that donation can count toward satisfying the person\u2019s required withdrawal for the year. You\u2019re correct on two counts: Such transfers can be made only from an IRA\u2014and that rule/restriction, on its face, seems silly. Then again\u2026it might not be.\n\n\u201cI think excluding QCDs from company retirement plans, including 401(k)s and 403(b)s, was done intentionally,\u201d says Ed Slott, an IRA expert in Rockville Centre, N.Y. \u201cI suspect Congress wanted to eliminate the cost and complexities of offering this in a company-plan setting.\u201d\n\nIn other words, QCDs involve work. If such donations were allowed through a 401(k), for instance, the plan administrator, as well as the employer that offers the plan, could find themselves having to transfer funds for dozens (perhaps hundreds) of employees or former employees throughout the year, as well as checking whether the charities involved are \u201cqualified.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis would be just another burden for company-plan administrators,\u201d Mr. Slott says. \u201cI don\u2019t see Congress changing this.\u201d\n\nThat said, you can roll over your 401(k) or 403(b) to an IRA. But be careful: If you are currently taking required distributions from a company retirement plan, you must first take your required minimum withdrawal for the year before doing the rollover, Mr. Slott notes. (An RMD can\u2019t be rolled over to an IRA. And that withdrawal, of course, is taxable.) The balance in your retirement plan, after taking the RMD, can then be rolled over to an IRA, and a QCD can be done from the IRA for that year or future years. (Taking the QCD from the IRA for that year won\u2019t exclude the RMD you took from the 401(k) or 403(b) from income on your tax return.)\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal.
