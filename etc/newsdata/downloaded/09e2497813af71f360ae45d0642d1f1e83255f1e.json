To access exclusive tickets, pay with your Capital One\u00ae Visa or Mastercard credit or debit card. Capital One\u00ae issued private label cards are excluded.\n\nSome Capital One exclusive events include a cookie dough making class with D\u014c, Cookie Dough Confections founder Kristen Tomlan, dinner with Cedric and Jean-Georges Vongerichten and a master sushi rolling class with Iron Chef Morimoto. The latter two events are already sold out despite the respective $350 and $275 cost per ticket.\n\nIndividual events at NYCWFF can range up to $400, but there are many priced $100 and under, plus some that are free with an RSVP.\n\nOne hundred percent of NYCWFF net proceeds benefit the Food Bank For New York City and No Kid Hungry\u00ae. Since the festival's inception in 2008, more than $12 million has been raised for these charities.\n\nThe partnership between Capital One and the NYCWFF came into fruition around the time the card issuer launched the Savor\u00ae Cash Rewards credit cards, Schrager says.\n\nBoth cards offer high cash-back rates on dining and entertainment purchases. Cardholders earn unlimited 3% cash back on dining and entertainment purchases with the Capital One\u00ae SavorOne\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card and cash back rises to 4% in those categories with the Capital One\u00ae Savor\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card.\n\nCapital One often talks to its customers to get feedback on what benefits they're looking for in a card and found that experiences are a big factor. \"We've been focused on finding creative ways to offer [cardholders] exclusive experiences and access that they are really passionate about,\" Lauren Liss, VP of U.S. cards at Capital One, tells CNBC Make It.\n\nThe NYCWFF is just one way the company is doing that. In addition to dining events, Capital One cardholders can also benefit from exclusive access to entertainment and sports events, such as the iHeartRadio Music Festival and college basketball and football games.\n\nDon't miss:\n\nCapital One launches two new Walmart credit cards\n\nI used the new Apple Card for a week in New York City\u2014here's what I learned\n\nLike this story?
