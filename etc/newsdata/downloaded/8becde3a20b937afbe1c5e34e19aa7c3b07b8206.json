The war in Europe is over and Britain has just gone to the polls in a general election, the result of which is delayed for more than a fortnight for the votes of the servicemen still overseas to be collected and counted.\n\nWhile the nation waits, Prime Minister Winston Churchill has a summit meeting in Potsdam with Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin and U.S. President Harry Truman.\n\nThe partnership and rivalry between Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee, pictured together here, is explored in a fascinating book by Leo McKinstry\n\nChurchill lead the United Kingdom through the Second World War while Attlee laid the foundations of the NHS and welfare state. Pictured together at a dinner in honour of the Australian prime minister in 1959, at the Dorchester hotel, London\n\nThough Churchill is confident he\u2019s won the election and will remain as Britain\u2019s leader, he invites his deadly rival, Labour leader Clement Attlee, to accompany him. It is the courteous and sensible thing to do, just in case.\n\nEven more courteously, Churchill makes an astonishing offer to the socialist Attlee: would he like the services of one of his valets \u2018to look after [his] luggage and deal with [his] personal requirements\u2019 on the trip to Germany. Even more astonishingly, Attlee suppresses the class warrior in him and gratefully accepts.\n\nToday, as the Brexit debacle descends ever deeper into a personalised, polarised slanging match, the thought of that happening now \u2014 of Boris lending his manservant to Jeremy Corbyn and, even more, of the prickly Jezza agreeing \u2014 had me hooting with laughter.\n\nMutual respect has disappeared from the political landscape, replaced by animosity and distrust.\n\nBut it need not be so, as Leo McKinstry\u2019s superb account of one of the great political rivalries \u2014 and double acts \u2014 of the 20th century shows.\n\nThe pair were also friendly towards one another. Churchill invited Attlee to a world leaders summit in Potsdam in 1945, shortly before the Labour leader beat him in a general election, and even offered him a valet to look after his luggage and 'personal requirements'\n\nIt reads like a timely parable about the necessity for cooperation, concession and compromise in politics. Otherwise chaos reigns.\n\nAllies in wartime and adversaries in peace, Attlee and Churchill shaped the country we live in, and left legacies that endure to this day.\n\nYet it is hard to imagine two characters more different. Boisterous, larger-than-life Churchill was flamboyant and in everyone\u2019s face; Attlee was quiet and undemonstrative to the point of anonymity and awkwardness \u2014 \u2018a funny little mouse\u2019, as Churchill\u2019s wife, Clemmie, called him.\n\nLittle things are telling. One had a horde of secretaries on permanent call to write down his every word of wisdom, often from his bed; the other bashed out speeches with three fingers on a battered typewriter.\n\nOne rounded off the day with champagne and brandy, the other shared a cup of bedtime cocoa with his wife, Vi. (She also drove him everywhere, even on election campaigns across the nation, in the family Hillman.) One holidayed in Monte Carlo, the other in Frinton.\n\nChurchill was extravagant to the point of near-bankruptcy (he had to be bailed out by less-than-savoury friends) while Attlee was so austere that he was once seen up on the roof of his house in suburban Stanmore cleaning his own gutters.\n\nEven when he was prime minister and weekending at Chequers, visitors were known to keep their coats on during dinner because he wouldn\u2019t turn up the heating.\n\nAttlee (left) was prime minister from 1945 to 1950, while Churchill (right) was prime minister during the war and after Attlee. In the centre of this photo, taken in 1952 at Buckingham Palace, is King George VI\n\nBut there was a bond between the men that was unique among political rivals holding such different views of the world. One was a crusader for free enterprise and laissez-faire, the other a champion of state control.\n\nIt was World War II, of course, that brought them together.\n\nChurchill became prime minister in the emergency of 1940, heading a cross-party coalition government. Attlee was part of it as Labour leader \u2014 a position he had slipped into almost by accident; he was seen as a stop-gap middle-of-the-roader who would keep the radicals of the far-Left in check.\n\nThe new book is being sold for \u00a325 and has been published by Atlantic\n\nChurchill directed his blood, sweat and tears to inspiring and leading the fight against Hitler. Attlee got on with the job of running the country, and proved very good at it.\n\nQuietly, Attlee laid the groundwork, for a national health service and a welfare state. His thoughts turned to planning the sort of country Britain should be after the war. And when Hitler was defeated and the coalition government disbanded, it was Attlee\u2019s vision of the future that hit the right note with a war-weary nation.\n\nAt that summit in Potsdam it was a sign of the new times that, during a victory parade of British soldiers, Attlee got a bigger cheer than Churchill.\n\nThe election result, when it finally came, was a landslide for Labour, and Attlee moved into No. 10 as prime minister (though not before fending off his rampant Left-wingers who, in typical factional Labour style, attempted even at that late stage to replace him with one of their own).\n\nA tearful Churchill was staggered by being ousted from power but took defeat on the chin, magnanimously congratulating his rival on his victory and wishing him well. He didn\u2019t carp, cry foul or call for a re-run. \u2018We have no right to feel hurt,\u2019 he pronounced. \u2018This is democracy. This is what we have been fighting for.\u2019 It\u2019s a lesson that some still need to learn in 2019.\n\nFor the next six years, Attlee pushed on with the social restructuring of Britain and the nationalisation of industries that would make him the icon of the Left he has become.\n\nAttlee, shown here making a statement at Labour party conference in Blackpool, 19454, was famously so careful with money that he was even seen on his roof cleaning the gutters himself\n\n(That he also gave the go-ahead for nuclear weapons, supported the foundation of the state of Israel and opposed the idea of a European Union \u2014 all deeply contentious issues for Labour supporters today \u2014 is often forgotten.)\n\nFrom the Opposition benches, Churchill gave his former deputy no quarter \u2014 dismissing Attlee with a stinging rebuke as \u2018a modest man, with much to be modest about\u2019.\n\nThey jousted constantly, though Churchill, with his quicksilver tongue, usually had the last word against the leaden Attlee.\n\nOne day, in a House of Commons cloakroom, the men are said to have taken up positions at urinals far apart. \u2018Feeling standoffish are we, Winston?\u2019 Attlee commented from his corner. Back roared Churchill: \u2018That\u2019s right, Clement. Whenever you see something that is big, private and works well, you want to nationalise it!\u2019\n\nBut, though there was rivalry and even occasional rancour, there was still huge mutual respect. The two men exchanged birthday greetings every year and frequently dined together. \u2018I have no feelings of unfriendliness to Attlee,\u2019 Churchill confided to his wife in a letter.\n\nAs for which of them came out on top in the end, what is perhaps most significant is that \u2014 as McKinstry points out \u2014 when the Tories returned to power in 1951, Churchill did not try to scuttle everything the Attlee government had done.\n\nYes, he continued to rage against socialism and promised to \u2018set the people free\u2019 from state intervention, but in reality he accepted that there was no turning back the clock, as did the nation. A welfare system, in some shape or other, was here for good.\n\nThe upshot of this most peculiar political partnership/rivalry was that, though lion-hearted Churchill won the war, it was the \u2018mouse\u2019 Attlee who won the peace.", "description": "Despite their rivalry, Churchill and Attlee also respected each other writes Leo McKinstry in his new book.
