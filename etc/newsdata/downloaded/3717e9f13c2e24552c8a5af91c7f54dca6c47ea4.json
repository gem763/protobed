And second, she finally has the support of Will (Jack Nolan), who is making up for being entirely useless throughout her problems with Connie by being There For Her at all times.\n\nArchie found Millbank on the fire escape after he\u2019d gone walkabout. He\u2019d become convinced that the boys he terrorised when he was a teacher had come to find him and get their revenge, so Archie felt compelled to tell him that it was her who attacked his car. Millbank realised that the terror he\u2019d been going though was similar to what he\u2019d inflicted on the boys and he collapsed. Archie got him back into resus, where they sorted out his heart and Archie said she\u2019d resign. Luckily for us, Millbank decided he wanted to forget the entire incident and go home with his grandson to reflect on what a horrible man he\u2019d been. Archie thought she\u2019d been horrible too, but Will reassured her that she could have left Millbank on the fire escape if she\u2019d been horrible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of horrible people, has this episode finally marked a turnaround for newish F1, Mason Reede (Victor Oshin)? For a lot of the time it was more of the same \u2013 Mason refusing to own up to any of his mistakes. When Rash (Neet Mohan) realised Mason hadn\u2019t talked to Ethan (George Rainsford) about his mistake with the D-dimer test, Mason\u2019s response was more or less to shrug.\n\nPlay nicely, lads (Picture: BBC)\n\nPatients are so often used as life lessons on Casualty, and it was patient Leena, who\u2019d had a funny turn at a fertility ceremony, who showed Mason where he was going wrong. Mason and Rash managed to work together to help Leena and Mason was the one who made a diagnosis. He was also able to relate to Leena\u2019s situation and opened up about the pressures on him from his family: \u2018They think the world of me \u2013 the family hero, the one who did good. So you can\u2019t let the people down, can you? Even if you\u2019re struggling and things haven\u2019t quite worked out the way you thought, you\u2019ve got to keep going despite the pressure.\u2019\n\nThis has always been my theory of why Mason acted the way he did and it makes complete sense of his character. Rash has given him one last chance, and Mason has given Rash his bike back, so maybe it\u2019s a clean slate for Mason. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how his character develops going forward. I hope he doesn\u2019t become too nice, because there\u2019s already a lot of very nice people in Casualty and sometimes you need someone who has a bit of an edge to them (waves at Dylan).\n\nEthan gets in deeper (Picture: BBC)\n\nEthan is one of the very nicest, sweetest people in the ED, but he\u2019s getting himself into quite a pickle by falling for Effie and using his position as a doctor to sneak her onto a CF trial which she was really too ill to qualify for. This week he got in even deeper after Effie\u2019s father Theo (Jim Sturgeon) asked him to find out whether Effie was in the \u2018active\u2019 or \u2018control\u2019 group on the trial. It\u2019s obviously essential for these things to be anonymous, otherwise biases creep in to pollute the test. Ethan knew this and refused to do as Theo asked \u2013 until Theo threatened to expose the fact that Ethan has been taking an interest in Effie that goes beyond strictly professional. The doctor in charge of the trial wouldn\u2019t give him any information and in fact she didn\u2019t know herself \u2013 but Ethan reassured Theo that Effie is in the \u2018active\u2019 group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthan has decided he\u2019s not very comfortable with all this subterfuge and told Will that it was over with Effie. We saw him ignore a call from her \u2013 but will he be able to ignore her when she inevitably turns up?\n\nSue Haasler is the author of the official BBC Holby City book, which you can read about here.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Archie got a shock.", "authors": ["Sue Haasler"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/archie-2-casualty-9-3455_1571151680.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
