FAA Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell said last month that if the AOA sensors differ by 5.5 degrees or more then MCAS cannot operate. If MCAS does operate it can only operate once unless the problem had been \"completely resolved\", he added.\n\nThe JATR is headed by Christopher Hart, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and includes air-safety regulators from the US, Canada, China, Indonesia, EU, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Japan.\n\nLast month, Hart said it was important to note \"the US aviation system each day transports millions of people safely, so it's not like we have to completely overhaul the entire system, it's not broken\".\n\n\"But these incidents have shown us that there are ways to improve the existing system.\"", "description": "International panel says Federal Aviation Administration lacked 'unified' development of key flight control system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/21d1887e79ff4ff7973c56165d3adfb8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
