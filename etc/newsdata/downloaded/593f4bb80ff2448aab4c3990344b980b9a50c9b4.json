We were competitive but we can do better. We can control moments with the ball better and take more chances in the box,\u201d said the Spaniard.\n\nLEAGUE FOLKLORE\n\nThis fixture is part of the folklore of the Premier League era, producing some epic battles between Alex Ferguson\u2019s and Arsene Wenger\u2019s title-winning sides, physical clashes between midfielders Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira with the highlights reel of past encounters also full of skill and flair.\n\nWhile there is certainly a retro feel to Old Trafford under the lights and in the rain, the only throwback on the field were some of the heavy and late challenges.\n\nThere are multiple weaknesses in both teams but what stood out when they met was the lack of class and quality in midfield.\n\nArsenal look lightweight and lacking any real spine while United, despite having France international Paul Pogba back from injury, were short of attacking options and creativity.\n\nNone of that was really a surprise. Both managers view their teams as being in transition and while United still lack obvious elements needed to compete at the top end, Arsenal\u2019s investments had raised hopes of something better.\n\nThere had been little excitement in the first half but United keeper David De Gea did have to pull off a fine double-save in the 44th minute, pushing out a low shot from Bukayo Saka and then doing well to keep out Matteo Guendouzi\u2019s follow-up.\n\nMoments later, United had the lead when Marcus Rashford found McTominay on the edge of the box and his slightly deflected shot towards the top corner beat motionless Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno.\n\nArsenal got back on level terms in controversial circumstances before the hour with a goal from Aubameyang.\n\nUnited left-back Axel Tuanzebe gave the ball away to Saka who threaded it through to Aubameyang but the linesman raised his flag well before the striker put the ball past De Gea.\n\nThe VAR review correctly showed United defender Harry Maguire had played Aubameyang onside and the goal was given.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nHowever, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer appeared furious that the linesman had flagged when recent practice has been for the flag not to be shown until the end of a move.\n\nMcTominay then missed a glorious chance to secure the points and add to his growing reputation when, from an Ashley Young corner, he headed over from close range, having lost his marker.\n\nLeno then made two good saves to keep Unai Emery\u2019s Arsenal side on level terms, diving to deny Maguire\u2019s effort from the edge of the box and then reacting well to keep out Marcus Rashford\u2019s stoppage-time free kick.", "description": "Manchester United were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Arsenal on Monday in a Premier League game which was a poor imitation of some of the past classic clashes between the rival clubs.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435659267&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1FN", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
