His family feared he had been killed, but Muthana has resurfaced at a northern Syria prison camp and is now pleading to come home.\n\nAll three were featured in one of the first propaganda videos ISIS used to attract western recruits.\n\nMuthana, who is now 22 years old, claimed in an ITV interview that he joined ISIS and traveled to Syria to \u201chelp the poor.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then when I first came to ISIS, you have to understand I came way before the caliphate was pronounced,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore all of these beheading videos, before all of the burnings happened, before any of that stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe came when ISIS propaganda and ISIS media was all about helping the poor, helping the Syrian people,\u201d Muthana added.\n\nThe widely publicized ISIS beheadings came later in 2014 when ISIS militants beheaded journalist James Foley and others, broadcasting their murders in widely disseminated propaganda videos.\n\nNasser Muthana, Aseel\u2019s brother, appeared in one of those propaganda videos in 2014 where he said, \u201cThe UK is afraid I\u2019ve come back with the skills I\u2019ve acquired.\u201d It is unclear what Nasser\u2019s fate has been since then.\n\nKhan was killed in a drone strike in 2015. Muthana is currently in a secret Syrian prison along with 5,000 inmates inside its packed cells.", "description": "A British ice cream seller who fled to join the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria five years ago is begging to come home.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Aseel-Muthana-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
