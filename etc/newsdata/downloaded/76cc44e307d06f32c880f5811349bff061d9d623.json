He also fretted about the possibility of an overloaded boat.\n\n\"People are now more desperate,\" Acosta said. \"I always told Luis that they shouldn't go if there were too many passengers on board.\"\n\nBefore they boarded, Bastardo snapped a cellphone photo of Katerin, Dylan and Victoria with their backs to the camera, staring out to sea. She sent it to her family.\n\nThe plan was to arrive at the Trinidadian port of Chaguaramas under cover of darkness. The 70-kilometer journey from Guiria typically takes about four hours, putting them in port around 8:30 p.m. at the latest. Luis wanted his son there early.\n\n\"At 6.30 in Chaguaramas, be waiting,\" he texted Berra at 4:37 p.m. as their voyage got underway.\n\nThose who know the route say pilots headed for Chaguaramas carrying migrants typically navigate along the coastline until reaching the eastern tip of the Paria Peninsula around nightfall. At that point, the lights of Trinidad\u2019s towns are visible as they prepare to enter the final 20-kilometer stretch, the Dragon's Mouths.\n\nEvening turned to night. The Ana Maria didn't show. Berra said he paced anxiously until police arrived at midnight on the Chaguaramas dock and told him to leave. He said he returned early Friday morning and waited all day and deep into the second night. Still nothing. He repeated the vigil on Saturday.\n\n\"After the first sinking, Maroly was afraid, but she still wanted to be here with us,\" Berra said in a phone interview from Trinidad.\n\nBack in El Tigre, Bastardo's family was growing uneasy. She and the others were not returning text messages.", "description": "A taxi dropped Maroly Bastardo and her two small children by a cemetery not far from the shore in northeast Venezuela. She still had time to change her mind.", "authors": ["Ivan Alvarado", "Angus Berwick"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ4LljFhrzXNv6tLzG-2wvqLs5fjMI-pCfnxGQHKKvexPjkZeLWjW4VCEBKewG_Q_SPjJEeQd0TWXhZUakqFF_rL_iOXfOORCE_7IxdH6Cm1l"}
