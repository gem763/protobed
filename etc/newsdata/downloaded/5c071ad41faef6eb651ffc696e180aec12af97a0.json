Consumers May Not Be Budging.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nFamiles can now sign up for Disney+, but Walt Disney \u2019s campaign to market the streaming service, to be available in less than two months, may not have moved the needle.\n\nThat matters because the future the company has planned, as a provider of content straight to consumers, forms the core of many investors\u2019 upbeat views about the stock. Disney shares (ticker: DIS) have outperformed the market and other media stocks as the company revealed its streaming strategy this year.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to deliver. Data from UBS suggests the company has some distance to go.\n\nDisney has set about reinventing itself in the past year, starting with a $81.2 billion move, including debt, to buy the majority of Fox\u2019s (FOXA) entertainment assets. It paired Fox\u2019s TV networks and film studios, including National Geographic and FX, with Disney\u2019s ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and other media properties. The deal, which closed in late March, also gave Disney a majority stake in the streaming service Hulu.\n\nDisney revealed the next step of its transformation in April, at an investor day focused on its direct-to-consumer streaming strategy. It set ambitious targets for subscriber growth, the content on its services, and how long it will take the streaming business to turn a profit. There will be three streaming options: Disney+ for family and children\u2019s programming, ESPN+ for sports, and Hulu, which Disney describes as targeting adult viewers.\n\nThe plan was celebrated on Wall Street. Disney shares jumped 12% the day after the announcement, and have now returned 21%, including dividends, since the start of the year. The S&P 500 has returned 21% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has returned 18%.\n\nSo far, so good. But now a UBS survey of more than 1,000 U.S. consumers conducted in mid September showed that while awareness of Disney+ rose from a month earlier, intent to subscribe hasn\u2019t.\n\nA total of 71% of respondents were either very aware or somewhat aware of Disney+\u2014up from 63% in mid August \u2014but 42% of consumers said they were likely to subscribe, practically even with August\u2019s 43%. Both measures were higher for younger, male consumers than for other groups.\n\nThe month-over-month comparison is meaningful because Disney began to promote Disney+ since the mid-August survey. The company revealed several shows and previews at the D23 Expo in late August.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger emphasized the importance of marketing Disney+ on the company\u2019s fiscal third-quarter earnings call on Aug. 6. \u201cComprehensive probably is an understatement,\u201d Iger said. \u201cIt is going to be treated as the most important product that the company has launched...certainly during my tenure in the job, which is quite a long time.\u201d\n\nThe survey also found that nearly half of likely subscribers said that they would drop at least one other video service, such as pay TV or other streaming offerings like Netflix (NFLX) or AT&T \u2019s (T) HBO.\n\nDisney+ is scheduled to be launched in the U.S. on Nov. 12. It will cost $6.99 a month, or $69.99 annually\u2014about half the cost of Netflix. An international rollout will follow.\n\nThe average forecast among Wall Street analysts is that 4.4 million U.S. subscribers will have signed up for the service by the end of 2019. UBS sees 2.5 million as more likely.\n\nAt its April investor day, Disney said it expects to have 60 to 90 million combined domestic and international Disney+ subscribers by the end of its fiscal 2024, which ends in September. That was more than most Wall Street analysts had anticipated. Barron\u2019s noted at the time that the targets were ambitious and that Disney risked falling short of its own projections, which could reverse the stock\u2019s 2019 gains.\n\nWrite to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com", "description": "Familes can now sign up for Disney+, but Walt Disney\u2019s campaign to market the streaming service, to be available in less than two months, may not have moved the needle.", "authors": ["Nicholas Jasinski"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110240/social", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
