It wasn\u2019t to be.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? Why aren\u2019t you in Europe, getting us a deal?\u201d one entirely unimpressed shopper asked him.\n\n\u201cI am, err, I am, err, I am going to get us a deal,\u201d Boris Johnson told him. To judge from the man\u2019s expression, he seemed about as convinced a deal would be forthcoming as Michel Barnier, who was, at this moment, over in Brussels, publicly stating for around the about 10,000th time that Boris Johnson has still not submitted any proposals for a new deal, at all.\n\nOh well. An hour later, Boris Johnson found himself five minutes into a speech in a convention centre in Rotherham, when a member of the public stood up and began heckling.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here? Why aren\u2019t you in parliament, sorting out the mess that you have created? Why don\u2019t you get back there and sort it out?\u201d said heckler wanted to know, in the 20-second window before he was thrown out.\n\nStill, back in the Downing Street bunker, there was much valuable data to be harvested from all this by Dominic Cummings. The voters might not agree on where exactly they want Boris Johnson to go, but as long as he gets away from them that should be enough.\n\nIt may very well be, that come the election campaign proper, Cummings will decide to attach the prime minister to the back of the campaign bus on one of those elasticated ropes often found at corporate fairs.\n\nThey could cover the whole country in a matter of days. Pull off the motorway, park up in the town centre, Johnson sprints 15 paces towards the general public and by the time they\u2019ve told him to go away he is already retracting on his springy leash.\n\nThere are other upsides to this strategy too. At one point, in Doncaster, the prime minister made the strategic error of engaging a member of the public in actual conversation.\n\nThere he was, barely a breath into his now standardised flim-flam on his one, big, new policy. You know the one, the one about 20,000 new police officers. The one he launched in a police training centre in West Yorkshire last week, at an event the head of West Yorkshire Police formally disowned in an official statement the following day.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re putting the same amount of police on the streets as what you took off,\u201d she told him, with rather exquisite bluntness.\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d the prime minister said, accidentally torpedoing the entire electoral purpose of his one flagship policy in just four words.\n\nIt is conceivably possible this is not how his thousands of backers in the Tory party dreamt it. All of six weeks ago, the idea was that, after the miserable May years, he was what they needed; the likeable, charismatic one. Get him out among the general public, this serial lying, child abandoning, all-round good egg and we\u2019ll clean up.\n\nThey probably hadn\u2019t foreseen him getting so comprehensively humiliated every time he walked into the House of Commons, but they\u2019d solved that problem by shutting it down.\n\nProroguing the general public, however, the prime minister is discovering, is not so straightforward.\n\nThis sort of thing can\u2019t be allowed to happen again. Just give what the voters want, prime minister. Which is for you to turn up, then go away again. Or, better still, don\u2019t turn up at all.", "description": "Another day on the election campaign trail for the election that isn\u2019t happening and Boris Johnson is doing his bit to bring this divided nation together.
