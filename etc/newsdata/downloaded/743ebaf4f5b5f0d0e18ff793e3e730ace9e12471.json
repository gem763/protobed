The term is defined by the Global Wellness Institute as buildings that are proactively designed and built to support the holistic health of their occupiers.\n\nThe drive to wellness, particularly in the workplace is also likely to continue. It will include a focus on air quality, good lighting, access to community, access to green spaces, as well as giving people lots of yoga classes.\n\nSunshine Coast market continues to shine\n\nThe Sunshine Coast market has been one of the stronger performers over the past quarter. Prices have gone up slightly, which is quite different from the rest of Australia.\n\nThe dynamic of the Sunshine Coast is different to the Gold Coast. Firstly, it is an area that still has quite a bit of capacity to grow. There aren\u2019t the land shortages that are starting to become apparent on the Gold Coast.\n\nIt is also an area that sees very little search from overseas. While the Gold Coast sees enormous search from places like the UK, New Zealand and even Japan, there is pretty much no search from these places to the Sunshine Coast.\n\nAt the moment, the areas on the Sunshine Coast that are seeing decent price growth are mid priced. Parrearra, close to Kawana, has seen the strongest price growth of 18% and it currently has a median of $807,000.\n\nA similar number of Melburnians and Sydneysiders search for property on realestate.com.au in the Sunshine Coast. In comparison, it\u2019s predominantly Sydneysiders who search for property in the Gold Coast.\n\nCommercial property transactions hit a record level in Australia\n\nIn the 12 months to Q3 2019, national commercial investment volumes hit a record $45.6 billion, according to a report released by Cushman and Wakefield on Thursday.\n\nThe majority of transactions were in the office sector while shopping centre sales continued to plummet.\n\nThe other noticeable trend was foreign purchases of Australian property. Over the past 12 months this accounted for 44% of total investment volume \u2013 the biggest purchasers coming from Singapore and Canada.\n\nAustralia is currently seen as a safe haven among all the global instability. Commercial property is also seen as a relatively safe asset class, particularly if the building contains stable tenants locked into long-term leases.\n\nContinued demand for commercial property is also continuing to push down yields.\n\nClearance rates\n\nThere has been no substantial change in clearance rates this week \u2013 still high in Melbourne and Sydney off the back of low auction numbers. There does not appear to be a significant uplift in listings as yet.\n\nFor our auction capitals \u2013 New South Wales and Victoria \u2013 clearance rates are 76% and 85% respectively.\n\nMelbourne had its biggest auction weekend for the year (26-27 October) with 85% of properties going under the hammer finding a buyer.", "description": "The\u00a0Sunshine Coast continues to outperform the\u00a0Gold Coast and wellness real estate is booming business in Australia, but what else is happening across the country?", "authors": ["Nerida Conisbee"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/25000408/capi_730a5b487d4b87b0309457d0a4327b1b_5e12d4bfcbf8f51510d8025f1a8cee51.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
