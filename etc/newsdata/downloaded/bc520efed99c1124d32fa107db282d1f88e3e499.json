F*** u b****'.\n\nAnother wrote 'Go back to ur f***** cave u n***** moneky (sic)'.\n\nA Leicester spokesman said: 'We are appalled by these comments, which the club has reported to the police and to the social media platform on which they were made.\n\n'Discriminatory behaviour has no place in football or in society and we will seek the strongest possible course of action to be taken against those responsible.'\n\nThe abuse belied legitimate criticism of Choudhury's tackle on Salah, with the incident following another in recent months that saw him injure Matt Ritchie.\n\nAfter the game, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said: 'It's a challenge I really don't understand. It's dangerous as hell.\n\n'He has to calm down in situations like this. It's not the first time. He is a super player, top development, but these kind of challenges - no!\n\n'He should know better. He maybe was unlucky with Ritchie, but it was him and he has to calm down.\n\n'You cannot only go for the man, and then he gets only a yellow card.'", "description": "Hamza Choudhury has been hit with a torrent of disgusting racist abuse after his tackle injured Mohamed Salah in Leicester's defeat against Liverpool.
