This is what is going to happen if we don't change something about our behavior,\" Degiacomi said, according to CNN.\n\nA study by Swiss researchers suggests that from 2017 to 2050, about half of the glacier volume will disappear, \"largely independently of how much we cut our greenhouse gas emissions.\" The study says that after 2050, the future is less clear.\n\n\"The future evolution of glaciers will strongly depend on how the climate will evolve,\" study-leader Harry Zekollari said in a statement. \"In case of a more limited warming, a far more substantial part of the glaciers could be saved.\"\n\nGlaciers have a big effect on the Alps, impacting the region's ecosystem and economy. The study cites glaciers as providing a source of water, especially important in warm and dry periods.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHikers in black clothes, some wearing funeral veils, climbed Pizol the same weekend of climate change protests all over the globe.\n\nWorld leaders are set to discuss climate change at the in New York on Monday.\n\nIn Iceland, a similar ceremony was held this past summer to commemorate Okjokull, a 700-year-old glacier declared dead in 2014.\n\nA plaque that commemorates the dead glacier reads:", "description": "On Sunday, more than 200 people paid their respects at a ceremony to mark the \"death\" of the glacier in the Swiss Alps.
