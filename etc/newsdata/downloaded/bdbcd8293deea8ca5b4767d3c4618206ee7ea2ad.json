The Albania-headquartered group declared that the authorization for the strike, using missiles and drones, came from the top mullah.\n\n\u201cAli Khamenei, supreme leader of the regime, directly ordered the commanders of the operation to a conduct the attack,\u201d the NCRI report said.\n\nIran has denied attacking Saudi Arabia and Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, fighting a brutal war against a Saudi-led coalition, has said they carried out the attack.\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to officially blame Tehran, as Saudi, U.S., European and UN investigators probe the attack. But privately, U.S. officials said there is mounting evidence that the resistance group is correct.\n\nThe council, working through member group the People\u2019s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK), says it has developed a large network of sources inside the Islamic regime and has revealed nuclear developments and facilities that were later confirmed by U.S. intelligence.\n\nThe council\u2019s report said the MEK \u201chas obtained exclusive and top-secret information sourced from inside the Iranian regime detailing the missile and drone attack carried out by the Iranian regime against the oil facilities of Saudi Arabia in Abqaiq and Khurais on September 14, 2019.\u201d\n\nThe report said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran\u2019s most powerful military group, \u201cdirected it at every step.\u201d\n\nIt deployed commanders from Tehran to Khuzestan province in southwest Iran. There, the Omidiyeh air base unleashed Ya-Ali cruise missiles first unveiled in 2014.\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council approved the strike at a July 31, 2019 meeting attended by President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, the report said, at a time when escalating U.S. sanctions were taking a harsh toll on the Iranian economy.\n\n\u201cThe simultaneous missile and drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities on September 14, 2019 emanated from inside Iran and was a blatant act of war that Khamenei, Rouhani, Zarif and other regime heads were responsible for in deciding, approving and implementing\u201d the mission, said Alireza Jafarzadeh, the council\u2019s Washington office deputy director.\n\nA defiant Mr. Zarif appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, warning that \u201cany war that the United States starts, it won\u2019t be able to finish.\u201d He called Mr. Trump, who so far has held off on a retaliatory strike against Iran, a \u201cbully.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we do is protect ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not at war with Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nMr. Zarif was a negotiating partner with Secretary of State John Kerry in 2015 to hammer out a 10-year nuclear deal signed by the U.S., Iran, Russia, China and leading European powers. President Trump withdrew from the pact last year and has begun ratcheting up economy sanctions that the regime calls an act of war.\n\nAlso attending the war session was the commander of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qassem Soleimani. The IRGC\u2019s air commander, the report said, \u201ctook the lead in implementing the operation.\u201d\n\nThe MEK suggested a new attack is planned. It says the IRGC has moved new units to the base since Sept. 22. \u201cThere is no information on their orders,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report contained satellite images of the military base, missile production plants and the location of tunnels used to hide the weapons.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
