Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days,\u201d senior adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\u201d The Vermont lawmaker has kept up a relentless campaign schedule, particularly during the summer months, and often makes three or four stops a day in different regions. He was scheduled to attend a gun policy forum in Nevada on Wednesday, and then make seven appearances in California on Thursday and Friday. At 78, Sanders is the oldest candidate in the Democratic field.\n\nThe big question is whether this unexpected break in his schedule hurts Sanders\u2019 campaign going forward. Democratic strategist Jim Manley tells the AP, \u201cGiven his recent stalls in the polls, the timing is pretty bad here.\u201d Maybe. I guess it\u2019s possible this could be the moment the wind goes out of his sails and Elizabeth Warren, who seems to have lots of energy, really leaves him far behind in the polls.\n\nBut there could also be an upside to going away for a few days and returning in dramatic fashion. Over the years there have been various articles about the fact that Sanders, unlike most politicians, doesn\u2019t like to talk about himself. He runs on policy rather than his own biography. But his campaign staff were hoping that would change a bit this time out:\n\nAs Sanders embarks on the early stages of his second presidential run, his aides and advisers are trying to figure out how best to balance the candidate\u2019s often obsessive focus on his legislative agenda with a type of personal, inclusive touch that could potentially win over more Democratic voters. That tension has been manifested in everything from the composition of Sanders\u2019 team to the degree to which he is willing to emphasize his own biography\u2026 \u201cHe\u2019s trying to find his voice on this because honestly he hasn\u2019t really had a voice of sharing [a] first-person narrative about him. It\u2019s just literally not the way he operates,\u201d Shakir told The Daily Beast, noting that as of Friday morning they were still going back and forth about some of the contents of the upcoming speeches.\n\nMy guess is that Sanders still won\u2019t want to talk much about his heart when he returns to the trail. He\u2019ll play it off with a little humor and try to get back to talking policy. But whether he talks about it or not, the heart procedure humanizes him a bit. It\u2019ll remind people he\u2019s more than a litany of far-left proposals America can\u2019t possibly afford. Maybe that will actually generate a warm feeling that his usual stump speech does not.\n\nAlready, Sanders is getting lots of well-wishes from his friends and political rivals on Twitter:\n\nBruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to @BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 2, 2019\n\n.@DrBiden and I are sending our best wishes to @BernieSanders, Jane, and the whole Sanders family.
