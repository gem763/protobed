I don\u2019t want to go in there and fight \u2018Boo Boo the Fool\u2019 because if he land a couple shots off on you then everybody going to be like, \u2018Oh, Tyron got touched up by this dude, and he ain\u2019t even a .500 fighter.\u2019 If you go in there and risk it all and let it hang, I want the No. 1 guy.\u201d\n\nWoodley (19-4-1 MMA, 9-3-1 UFC), who claimed the welterweight title with a massive overhand right to finish Robbie Lawler in 2016, said he always wanted to box while growing up.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted to do was box when I came up,\u201d Woodley said. \u201cI just started MMA at 23, so I felt I was a little old to start boxing at that age. But since I was a kid, that was the only sport I\u2019ve ever wanted to do. So most of my training is boxing training.\u201d\n\nRealistically, Woodley knows he wouldn\u2019t outbox Alvarez over the course of 12 rounds, but he certainly believes he has the power to put him out.\n\n\u201cNo. 1, I\u2019m not going to sit there and try to win 12 rounds, let\u2019s be real,\u201d Woodley said. \u201cHis defense is crazy. He\u2019ll slip an uppercut and make you look real stupid,so I\u2019m throwing all unorthodox. I\u2019m trying to knock him out.\n\n\u201cIf I land, he going down, let\u2019s not even play. It don\u2019t matter how many boxing and fights you got and how many MMA stuff, If I hit Canelo with everything, throw some (expletive) on the punch, it\u2019s a wrap.\u201d", "description": "Tyron Woodley seems to think he'd have a good chance against Canelo Alvarez inside the squared circle.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/tyron-woodley-ufc-214.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
