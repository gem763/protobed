This is far preferable to a contest at the start of a Parliament where new MPs will not be similarly informed,\" he told the Commons of his plans.\n\n\"We would not want anyone to be whipped senseless, would we?\"\n\nIn an emotional speech, he said he had been proud to stand up for the interests of MPs and to act as the \"backbenchers' backstop\".\n\n\"Throughout my time as Speaker, I have sought to increase the relative authority of this legislature for which I will make absolutely no apology to anyone, anywhere, at any time.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Speaker has found fame across Europe with his signature cry capturing the public's attention\n\nMr Bercow received a standing ovation from the Labour benches after announcing his imminent departure, but most Tory MPs stayed in their seats.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn led tributes, saying the Speaker had stood up for and promoted democracy, adding that the \"choice and timing\" of his exit date was \"incomparable\".\n\nFor the government, Michael Gove said his determination to give MPs increased opportunities to hold the government to account were \"in the best tradition of Speakers\".\n\nWhen he was first elected, Mr Bercow said he intended to serve no more than nine years in the job.\n\nThe Speaker is chosen by all MPs in the House by secret ballot.\n\nFor many years, the role alternated between the two largest parties although this unwritten convention was broken in 2000 when Labour's Michael Martin succeeded his colleague Betty Boothroyd.\n\nPotential Labour successors to Mr Bercow include Commons deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, who announced his candidacy on Twitter.\n\nLabour's Chris Bryant and Conservatives Sir Edward Leigh and Eleanor Laing, also a deputy speaker, have also announced they will stand.\n\nOther possible contenders include Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader and the longest-serving female MP in the House.", "description": "He says he will quit as Speaker and MP at the next election or on 31 October, whichever comes first.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mwzhb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
