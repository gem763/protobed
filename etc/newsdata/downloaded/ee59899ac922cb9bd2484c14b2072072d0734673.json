U.S. gold futures GCcv1 also slipped 0.1% to $1,492.\n\n\"Gold has broken multiple resistance levels in recent times\n\nand now we are seeing a correction taking place,\" said Silver\n\nBullion sales manager Vincent Tie.\n\n\"But weak data across the world has firmed concerns about a\n\nslowdown in the global economy and that is providing some\n\nsupport to the safe-haven metal.\"\n\nMarket participants look for updates on the U.S.-China trade\n\ntalks. Trade negotiators were working on nailing down a Phase 1\n\ntrade deal text for their presidents to sign next month, U.S.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday, but offered\n\nlittle details. With no top-level meetings in sight anytime soon, investors\n\npondered how much longer the ugly trade spat, that has roiled\n\nfinancial markets around the world, will continue.\n\nInvestors are also in a wait-and-watch mode ahead of Brexit\n\ntalks later in the session, which will determine how Britain\n\nwill part with the European Union.\n\nGlobal stocks barely moved as soft U.S. data raised\n\nconcerns about the health of the U.S. economy and risks of\n\nglobal recession, given consumption has been one of few\n\nremaining bright spots in the global economy. MKTS/GLOB\n\nU.S. retail sales dropped for the first time in seven\n\nmonths in September, suggesting that manufacturing-led weakness\n\ncould be spreading to the broader economy, keeping the door open\n\nfor the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again later this\n\nmonth. OCBC said the October rate-cut fever may resume as global\n\nrisk sentiments stay muted after disappointing retail sales\n\nnumbers, which could prove to be a tipping point for the U.S.\n\neconomy.\n\nAmong other precious metals, palladium XPD= notched a\n\nrecord high of $1,782.60 an ounce, extending gains into a fourth\n\nsession.\n\nPalladium is crucial in the making of catalytic converters\n\nused in exhaust systems of vehicles, and concerns over its\n\nsupply running out have helped lift prices by more than 41% this\n\nyear alone, despite a weakening auto sector.\n\nMeanwhile, silver fell 0.3% to $17.33 per ounce,\n\nwhile platinum XPT= inched 0.3% higher to $885.54 per ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold holds below $1,490/oz as markets look for trade cues", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF0N0TA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
