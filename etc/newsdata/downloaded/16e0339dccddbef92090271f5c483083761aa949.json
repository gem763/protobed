It\u2019s a public holiday in Bangladesh, the one time of year the 25-year-old can leave the mayhem of the city behind and see her family: her mother, her aunt.\n\nAnd her daughter.\n\n\u201cThere she is!\u201d Her little girl is standing in front of the two-bedroom tin hut in a remote village 200km (125 miles) north of Chittagong, south-east Bangladesh. Mother and daughter embrace.\n\nIf she could, the young seamstress would still live here. The air is fresher, there is more space, and some of her friends still live in the village. There\u2019s just one problem: \u201cThere isn\u2019t any work.\u201d Agriculture has ceased to be a feasible source of income. Money doesn\u2019t grow on trees \u2013 it is spun in the textile looms of the city.\n\nAnd so this family copes as best it can, the older women raising the child while Tasnia works six-day weeks, sewing T-shirts and jeans for global consumers, for about 8,400 taka (\u00a380) a month.\n\nLow pay in the garment industry still a reality despite pledges \u2013 study Read more\n\nThese three generations are a neat microcosm of an entire nation. The older women, who grew up in the years after independence in 1971, worked in unpaid labour, trying to survive in the grinding poverty for which the country became renowned in the 1970s.\n\nThe young girl, a 21st-century child, schooled and spirited, will in all probability enjoy better prospects. And in the middle, Tasnia Akter, from the \u201cfactory generation\u201d, one of approximately 4.5 million textile workers who have transformed the fortunes and reputation of Bangladesh.\n\nThe crucial question is this: is Akter a glorious paragon of the \u201crise and rise\u201d of Bangladesh, with its 50-year journey to becoming a middle-income nation powered by hard-working women? Or is she a sickening example of an exploited labourer who ruins her health for companies making high margins and consumers who buy cheap jeans?\n\nThe answer: perhaps a bit of both.\n\n\u201cSure, Tasnia suffers a lot, she has to support her family \u2013 but I had to suffer much more,\u201d says her aunt, Honufa Begum. After her husband died, Begum worked as a maid in Chittagong. \u201cJust provide food and lodging for me and my daughter,\u201d she recalls asking the family. They did. But they did not pay her. Begum did not complain.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside? Show Hide Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

But I don\u2019t want to be a slave. I don\u2019t want to always be on my toes, waiting for orders. At least when I come home in the evening from the factory, I am done for the day.\u201d\n\nChanged fortunes\n\nWhen the history is written of how much of humanity was lifted out of poverty in the decades after 1980, Bangladesh will provide one of the biggest chapters. GDP has soared vertiginously since 1980.\n\nThe number of people living below the poverty line has fallen from more than 44% in 1991 to less than 13%. Numbers for neonatal and maternal mortality have dwindled. Family sizes have fallen.\n\nPeople now live on average one-third longer than they used to 40 years ago \u2013 a gain in longevity that is practically without rival anywhere in the world.\n\nBut it has not come without tragedy, toil and exploitation. Six years ago, the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Dhaka, killing more than 1,100 people, injuring more than 2,300. Rana Plaza became synonymous with textile workers\u2019 atrocious working conditions; for the blood, sweat and sacrifice so easily overlooked by western consumers hunting bargain T-shirts on the high street. Bangladeshi workers are still among the lowest-paid in the world.\n\nOver the years, however, activists, workers and researchers have fought for at least some change in the garment industry. The minimum wage has doubled. Safety improvements have been made. Many workers are able to put a little aside to ensure that their children get a proper education.\n\nAnd for Akter and the millions of other women who make up around 80% of the textile workforce, the industry represents a possibility to earn money. They can attain at least some economic freedom in a society where women typically are housewives; where the only option in the countryside is to marry.\n\nThe vast industry generates myriad sub-industries too. The market along the dusty main road in Chittagong is usually bustling with people. Opposite the Clifton garments factory, Jallal Uddin, 38, is selling cake, bananas and tea to the workers on their way home. The father of two has had his stall for eight years now. He is proud of not having accumulated any debt. His formula is simple: the more garment workers there are, the more business for him.\n\nTasnia Akter has been working for her factory for the past four years. The small premises is owned by one of the country\u2019s big manufacturers: there are more than 30,000 employees, with brand customers such as WalMart and H&M. For Akter, working in the factory means progress: it is a means of paying the debts of her family, to support her seven-year-old daughter, and to earn a living after her husband left her \u2013 a fate that many garment workers share.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d she says. She sends around 2,000 taka home every month, as well as the occasional windfall: a rice cooker is stored in her parents\u2019 cupboard; the company awarded it to her for not missing any days and for working quickly.\n\nBut if she can\u2019t save anything for herself, is she really getting on? Is progressing from slave-like working conditions to meagre salaries really enough? Or is the country\u2019s sweatshop image still accurate today?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tasnia and her daughter shopping in the village market before Eid.

In the 1980s, workers lived in shacks and toiled in factories with no toilets or safe drinking water. Now even a cursory look at their lunch boxes will show they are eating better than in the past, he says.\n\nBut he adds that many workers are malnourished and some still sleep on the floor. \u201cMost workers can\u2019t save anything for their post-work years.\u201d Nevertheless, there are small indications that the quality of life is improving. \u201cWorkers like to spend the last penny for the betterment of the family: some send their children to private kindergarten, or to private tutors.\u201d\n\nIt was the Rana Plaza disaster that arguably triggered the biggest safety improvements. Following a broad deal between unions and more than 200 garment companies such as Primark and H&M, more than 1,600 factories were inspected and hazards identified and dealt with. Factory owners invested in fire doors, sprinkler systems and electrical upgrades. Some tore down factories and built them anew to keep their business going. A general manager of the company where Tasnia Akter works says the new rules of business are simple: \u201cNo compliance, no contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you compare pre-Rana Plaza and post-Rana Plaza, the one thing that really has changed is safety,\u201d says Kalpona Akter (no relation to Tasnia), a labour activist and executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity (BCWS). Between 2005 and 2012, more than 500 workers died in textile factories. After 2014, the annual number of fatalities has remained \u201cwell under 30\u201d, according to the Stern Centre for Business and Human Rights at New York University .\n\n\u201cWorkers are now more aware of their rights,\u201d says Kalpona Akter. When she founded BCWS in 2000, few workers knew they had any rights at all.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The collapse of the Rana Plaza building in April 2013 led to improved safety in garment factories.

The activist and politician explains how it is impossible to feed a family on the new minimum wage of 8,000 taka.\n\nWhile the minimum wage has indeed been doubled, it is still only half of what the unions had suggested \u2013 and far from a living wage. A study by CPD found that the overall cost of living for garment workers had increased by 86% between 2013 and 2018, with food costs up 57%. Last December the influential manufacturers\u2019 association BGMEA made it clear that owners would close factories if the minimum wage increased further. It called on brands to increase their prices as a result. Nothing happened.\n\nWhen asked how much she thinks she deserves, Tasnia Akter says: 10,000 taka, around \u00a396.\n\nThe green bank for kids - set up by a child Read more\n\nIn Chittagong, many workers live near the factories. The streets, turned muddy by the rain, are lined with corner shops, barbers and vegetable sellers. Nadira Begum, a 26-year-old sewing operator, shares a room with her three-year-old daughter in a compound with other families. Her husband shows up from time to time; he has another wife as well.\n\n\u201cAs soon as there is a raise, everything gets more expensive,\u201d she says. She already pays around 3,000 taka per month for the room. While Begum earns about nine times as much as her mother, she is unsure whether her purchasing power has gone up much. She does have amenities such as a fan and a fridge. She joined the union after it helped her when she was about to be fired for being pregnant, she says. Now she has lost her job. Begum believes it is primarily because she is a union member. But she doesn\u2019t seem too fazed. One thing that has changed is her self-assurance, the pride in her abilities: \u201cI am not worried. I am a skilled worker; I will just go and get another job.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Tasnia Akter\u2019s name has been changed\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
