M\u00e9tier\n\n(Superlative)\n\nThe pinnacle of fine dining in Washington tends to involve moving from one room to another during the night, tasting menus that blend old ideas with the new, tableside service, a sense of humor and the luxury of quiet. M\u00e9tier offers all those frills and more in an underground space that opens with drinks and hors d\u2019oeuvres in an intimate salon and continues in a dining room graced with old paintings, well-spaced tables, a candlelit chandelier and a view of the talent behind a big window into the kitchen.\n\nA highlight reel from September would start with a brilliant chilled carrot consomm\u00e9 so clear you can read through it. (For proof, its glass bowl is set on a \u201cplace mat\u201d cut from the pages of The Washington Post.) A few dishes pair first-rate if familiar ingredients with exceptional flourishes: garden-fresh basil broth with sauteed branzino and a bracing Dijon mustard sorbet with rosy grilled Virginia lamb loin. Other combinations find chef-owner Eric Ziebold making a sauce before your eyes or reminding you he\u2019s as adept at Japanese cooking as he is at French. Garnished with a pale green sorbet ignited with yuzu chile paste, cubes of lightly fried, melt-in-the-mouth tofu set in hot smoked tomato water will go down as one of the most extraordinary things I ate all year.\n\n\n\nGianduja chocolate torchon with churros, cinnamon ganache and corn milk ice cream (Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\nMini ice cream sandwiches.

(Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)\n\nM\u00e9tier\u2019s menu feels like a flight of fancy\n\n(Excellent/Superlative)\n\nDiners will find plenty to entice them on the menu of the hautest underground dining room in the city, starting with a garden of icy minced vegetables that constitutes a bracing ratatouille and ending with a small stove atop which patrons can retrieve hot chocolate cookies with a tiny spatula. Diners begin the evening with a welcome drink and an elegant snack in a salon with a fireplace before moving into a dining room with tables spaced to afford maximum privacy and a window that captures the kitchen action. Chef Eric Ziebold shares his fascination with Asia, sending out snowy halibut encircled in coconut-sweetened corn with compressed mango. Foie gras teetering on a bundle of savoy cabbage stuffed with duck confit is French to its core, while a reimagined root beer float, based on sarsaparilla cake, suggests a fantasy state fair. The missing ingredient right now? Service to match. For $400 a person, wine pairings and gratuity included, customers deserve more than rapid-fire descriptions of dishes and drinks followed by turned heels. Especially given the competition, where staff makes you feel as if you\u2019re the only diners in the room.\n\nThe following review appeared in The Washington Post\u2019s 2017 Fall Dining Guide as No. 5 on Tom\u2019s Top 10.\n\n\n\nGrilled Moulard duck foie gras with tomato jam and Darden ham mouillette at M\u00e9tier. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)\n\nNo. 5 M\u00e9tier\n\n(Superlative)\n\nIsn\u2019t it civilized to start dinner with canapes and drinks in a salon before moving into the dining room? Isn\u2019t it nice to share a meal with someone and not have to read lips or shout to be heard? Isn\u2019t it a treat to eat the refined and frequently playful cooking of Eric Ziebold, also the creator of the upstairs Kinship? Even the staff will tell you they raised their eyebrows at the idea of pairing bananas with sea urchin, but I swear, the roasted fruit and the ocean-scented delicacy come together magically with the aid of shaved truffles in a first-course bavarois. Background stories accompany each dish. Ziebold\u2019s bright and icy ratatouille of minced vegetables was inspired by working in his garden; the chef\u2019s olive-oil-poached black bass, served over soft couscous and finished with saffron broth, pays homage to a trip to Tunisia with his wife and co-owner, Celia Laurent, who is as polished a host as any. At no moment are you eating anything ordinary. With the steak, a cut from Martin Ranch, comes a blue cheese sticky bun that almost makes us forget about the restaurant\u2019s prized Parker House rolls, and one of the two desserts shows the affinity between tomatoes and pink peppercorns. Grill stripes on the foie gras are mimicked on its plate, with bands of toasted brioche crumbs, and a tribute to Gateau St. Honore by the pastry chef, Anne Specker, is ferried on a green Parisian street sign. Did I mention the discreet service and the wine gems? The many polished details add up to an exceptional evening \u2014 and a revised rating.

This being the fine-dining lair of chef Eric Ziebold, the bites include a clear tomato consomm\u00e9 poured over sparkling herb granita and petite corn falafel, crumbs of which are brushed away with a thick Garnier-Thiebaut napkin. Any reservations I had about M\u00e9tier in its early months were erased by a return dinner in September, seven courses that affirm Ziebold\u2019s role as one of Washington\u2019s premier talents. Does avocado toast need a makeover? The chef, visible behind a window in the dining room, adds a nicely chewy Japanese rice cake and a frame of dashi jelly. Until I tasted the combination, I didn\u2019t know pork jowl and osetra caviar had such an affinity for compressed watermelon. Nor did I consider barbecue an appropriate application for lobster, tingling bites of seafood paired with white corn pudding and a garnish of okra tempura. Ziebold\u2019s affection for Japan continues with a finger of premium kuroge beef, its richness foiled with shiso chimichurri and flattered with an elegant syrah (the 2014 Domaine Vincent Paris Cornas La Geynale). A dessert of \u201cearly fall fruits\u201d gathers marbles of apple and pear, and small scoops of Concord grape sorbet and hazelnut ice cream, that together put autumn on a pedestal. As you depart, a server proffers a gift of kitchen-made honey-thyme vinaigrette (a big step up from the previous parting gesture, a bottle of water). Consider it a chance to dress your salad like a star back home.\n\n--\n\nThe following review was originally published June 22, 2016.\n\n\n\nChef Eric Ziebold and his wife and partner, Celia Laurent, in the salon at M\u00e9tier. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)\n\nM\u00e9tier review: Eric Ziebold\u2019s newest attraction tickles more than it transports\n\n(Excellent)\n\nThe only question I had after eating at Kinship, the suave, a la carte American restaurant introduced by Eric Ziebold last winter: How would the chef try to top the experience at M\u00e9tier, his more exclusive dining retreat that followed downstairs this spring? Kinship, after all, made an uncommon three-star impression, with dishes such as lobster French toast and a setting whipped up by a noted interior designer, Washington\u2019s own Darryl Carter.\n\nNow, with several meals at M\u00e9tier under my ever-tighter belt, I can tell you the differences between the siblings are many and rich, sometimes even surprising. With M\u00e9tier, for instance, you get an elevator ride from street level to basement that\u2019s so slow and deliberate, you imagine your party ending up somewhere in China, tomorrow. Instead, the doors open to a high-ceilinged, softly lighted room that suggests a nobleman\u2019s salon replete with low couches, flickering hearth, tables that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and men in jackets. M\u00e9tier, named for the French word for skill in one\u2019s job, is the rare restaurant that asks you to dress up for dinner.\n\nThe first face you are likely to see is that of Celia Laurent, the chef\u2019s wife and business partner, who asks if you\u2019d like a drink and a preview of the menu, then returns with canapes that have included a delicate falafel dabbed with cumin yogurt and a two-bite lobster roll: seafood heaven. While there\u2019s no rush to leave the cocoon, the sumptuous snacks whet a diner\u2019s curiosity for what awaits next door; soon enough, you\u2019re led to a hushed dining room, fewer than 40 seats, where the chef and his crew are on display behind an expanse of glass.\n\nNotice a pattern? Ziebold hopes the elevator ride and a spell in the salon allow guests time to decompress, while the sight of a band of cooks forges a bond between kitchen and customer. As the chef sees it, luxury dining is based, in part, on a sense of intimacy.\n\n\n\nPre-dinner hors d'oeuvres served in the salon at M\u00e9tier. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)\n\nPoached Alaskan halibut, coconut rice, cilantro, curried mousse and sea urchin butter at M\u00e9tier. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)\n\nUnlike at Kinship, M\u00e9tier doesn\u2019t ask you to make food decisions. Most diners get the same seven-course, $200 dinner, part of which you pay for when you make a reservation. (No worries if you don\u2019t eat meat or gluten; the kitchen can accommodate you.) The meal begins with theatrics: waiters bearing smoke-filled glass cloches that contain butter-braised fingerling potatoes on a puddle of lemony creme fraiche, a duo decked out with smoked bonito shavings that appear to wave from the plate. Caviar lends shine and a saline edge. Your brain recognizes the flavor profile, and you nod in amusement when a server says the dish is a riff on (yes!) a loaded baked potato.\n\nA chef with aspirations knows conveyance vies with cooking for a diner\u2019s attention these days, hence the little log that serves as backdrop for the second course: a salad composed of juniper-spiked meringue mushrooms and tiny mushroom fritters sprouting from the wood, with pickled mushrooms and smoked ham nestled in a flat bowl on one end of the limb. Equally clever and luscious is an ivory bar of poached halibut sharing its bowl with fragrant coconut rice and balls of foamy curry, a subtle tropical medley embellished by a pitcher of melted sea urchin butter. The hot stream explains the vessel, a black ceramic bowl modeled on the spiny shell of a sea urchin.\n\nSure, the recipes for some of these dishes would be nice, but I\u2019d be just as happy with the contacts for M\u00e9tier\u2019s imaginative plate-makers.\n\nThe four-star Inn at Little Washington features a painter\u2019s palette of vivid sorbets in tiny jars, presented with a thin cookie \u201cbrush.\u201d M\u00e9tier does something similar, albeit savory, with its fourth course, a round of maple decked out with shaved raw kuroge beef and contrasting condiments. A bite of the cool marbled beef, so pink you could mistake it for a watermelon radish, makes for heady feasting, especially when followed by the application of one of four accents (my favorite is a horseradish mousse).\n\n\n\nA palette of kuroge beef with spring garlic tapenade, shiso chimichurri, horseradish mousse, smoked beef butter and Bolivian pink salt at M\u00e9tier. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)\n\nNext comes a trolley with lamb rib-eye, because fancy dining means at least one course is going to be fussed over by a waiter, even if it doesn\u2019t need to be. In this case, the roasted meat, fragrant from the hay in which it\u2019s been cooked, is carved into succulent slices and presented with silken roasted peppers and an olive sauce. The dish is perfectly pleasant, but frankly, the lamb (rack, sausage and ballotine) I enjoyed at Kinship, flanked by similar peppers and dreamy grits, trumped this rendition.\n\nDessert is spread across two courses: brown sugar shortcakes with rhubarb sorbet followed by a frozen riff on s\u2019mores using graham cracker cream and chocolate semifreddo. The first can be disappointing when the star attraction tastes overbaked. The latter, an elegant, not-too-sweet version of the campfire classic, keeps diners entertained as they watch their waiter singe marshmallow ice cream with a small blow torch.\n\nDessert plates are removed and replaced by \u2026 just the bill. Almost anywhere else, that\u2019s understandable. At a destination restaurant where you\u2019ve already put down $150 per person \u2014 and wine upgrades can double the tab \u2014 the transaction feels as abrupt as when \u201cThe End\u201d appears before you expect it, or the lights go up at a club in mid-rave. M\u00e9tier\u2019s in-town rival for our fine-dining dollars, Pineapple and Pearls, has solved the tricky problem by having diners pay for their $250 meal before they even show up for dinner. M\u00e9tier\u2019s competition on the Hill also sends diners home with a sweet treat for future enjoyment, a generous stroke.\n\nHere near the convention center, you just get up and return to the elevator. Okay, the gesture waiting in your valet-parked car is a nice detail, but who wakes up after a big-deal dinner feeling delighted by a bottle of water?\n\n\n\nMorel and king trumpet mushroom salad, Italian parsley, ham, caramelized sunchoke puree and Juniper meringues served on a log at M\u00e9tier. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)\n\nAsk the chef to differentiate upstairs from downstairs, and he\u2019ll tell you that Kinship is meant to feel like dinner in his home while M\u00e9tier was created to be a restaurant pulling out all the stops. Cooking at the late CityZen in the Mandarin Oriental, Ziebold garnered four stars, my highest rating, for his efforts. But then the bar for fine-dining shifted.\n\nMake no mistake. M\u00e9tier is an impressive addition to the landscape. But for a place that\u2019s asking a lot of its customers, patrons deserve to be more than tickled.
