I don\u2019t like the shift to the left,\u201d he explained to CNBC, adding that the market, of course, will open, but it won\u2019t be pretty.\n\n\u201cIt would be a bear market and they go on for a year and go down 25%,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t make the poor people rich by making rich people poor.\u201d\n\nOf course, as one member of the Financial Twitterati pointed out, fears of a Democrat steering the ship just might be overblown:\n\nSo, I went and did the homework.
