Flooded streets remained, and the count of damaged and totaled homes ticked upward even as some curfews were lifted, flights resumed and amusement park rides again twirled.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s gone,\u201d said Jen Gilreath, a 33-year-old bartender whose Jacksonville home filled with knee-high floodwaters.\n\nAs crews labored to repair the lone highway connecting the Keys, residents of some of the islands closest to Florida\u2019s mainland were allowed to return and get their first look at the devastation two days after Irma roared in with 130 mph (209 kph) winds.\n\nPalm Beach Post: Gasoline supplies flow, but more shortages possible as exodus reverses\n\nBefore Hurricane Irma , gas stations ran out of fuel as frightened Floridians stocked up on petrol. After the storm, fuel shortages will shift from neighborhood stations to a new venue \u2014 gas pumps along Interstate 95, Interstate 75 and Florida\u2019s Turnpike.\n\nIrma sparked the largest evacuation in state history, and now those who fled are returning en masse.\n\n\u201cWe had almost 6 million people forced to evacuate their homes before Irma, which means we\u2019ll have 6 million people coming back into the state in the coming days,\u201d said James Miller of the Florida Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association.\n\nTampa Bay Times: When life (and a hurricane) gave her neighbors lemons, this girl made lemonade\n\nDanika Kubiak is no stranger to the lemonade business. When her neighbor\u2019s dog ate her retainer last year, Danika set up on their block. She asked for donations. She raised $15. Anything to lower that orthodonture bill, right?\n\nSo when the freckled-nose 7-year-old woke up on Tuesday and realized some of her neighbors still didn\u2019t have power, she went up and down 14th Avenue NE, knocking on doors. \u201cWould you like to do a lemonade stand?\u201d she asked Meara Hill, still in her pajamas. The 8-year-old said sure, and they added coffee and power strips to the mix.\n\n\u201cI thought this might help,\u201d said Danika, standing outside their two-story house with plywood still on the windows.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thirsty!\u201d yelled a woman slowing her Toyota in the street.\n\n\u201cLemonade or coffee?\u201d Danika shouted back, then asked if she\u2019d like ice.\n\nHelping her neighbors was as much a help to Danika, 36 hours after Irma made her bedroom window rattle. She had never experienced a hurricane, living in the Old Northeast all her life. She had tried to stay busy in the hours leading up to the storm, walking to the bay to see where the water had receded. She watched so much Berenstain Bears that her mother memorized the theme song.", "description": "Sun Sentinel: Governor: \u2018Work to do\u2019 for Florida to recover .09/02/2019 3:22:40AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
