But I won\u2019t stand for it, dear reader. Sometimes, a regular clock perfectly combines form and function to give you what to you need while also looking pretty great on a nightstand. Give your phone a break and get an actual, real-deal alarm clock to set by your bedside and scare you into waking up like the good ol\u2019 days.\n\nPhilips Wake-Up Light Alarm Clock with Colored Sunrise Simulation, $115: The Philips Wake-Up Light is truly more than an alarm clock, but it\u2019s an alarm clock nonetheless. Set an alarm and enjoy a gentle awakening with light that mimics the sunrise to help stir you before an actual alarm goes off. This helps with the whole \u201choly shit\u201d moment of waking up before you\u2019re out of REM sleep.\n\nMARATHON Classic Silent Sweep Alarm Clock, $30: You weren\u2019t escaping this list without getting a classic analog clock. This one comes in 10 different colors, has an ambient glow when it gets dark to illuminate the dial, and has an easy alarm with a snooze button. What more could you ask for?\n\nDigital Alarm Clock, with Wooden Electronic LED Time Display, $20: This version of an alarm clock is a little sleeker and a little more advanced. It shows the temperature and humidity right next to the time (which can be set to a 24-hour clock if you\u2019d like). You can set up to three alarms and it has three brightness levels so the glow won\u2019t keep you awake. You can even set a weekday mode so that it only goes off Monday through Friday.\n\nAll-new Echo Dot, $60: It may seem trivial for Amazon to have added a clock to the Echo Dot, but it would help immensely when I\u2019m running late and can\u2019t find my phone or when I wake up in the middle of the night and want to see how much more sleep I can get. It just makes sense!\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse. Follow us on Twitter and sign up for our newsletter for even more recommendations and exclusive content.
