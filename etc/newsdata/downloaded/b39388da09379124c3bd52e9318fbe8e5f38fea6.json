Auditors said the data available did not show that the department was ready, or would be ready, if the UK were to leave the EU on the planned date.\n\nMeg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said the report was deeply concerning and could result in the \u201cgravest of consequences\u201d.\n\nBoris Johnson refuses to apologise for language about Jo Cox Read more\n\n\u201cThe Department of Health and Social Care still doesn\u2019t know whether all stockpiles are in place, it has no idea whether social care providers are ready and it is still not certain whether all the freight capacity government needs will be in place on time. If government gets this wrong, it could have the gravest of consequences,\u201d the Labour MP said.\n\nAuditors examined the supply and transport of 7,000 medicines that come to the UK either from or via the EU as well as at least 450,000 different medical devices available on the NHS, most of which come to the UK through ports on the Channel.\n\nThe report said additional freight capacity chartered by the government for shipping priority goods across the Channel may not be fully available until the end of November, a month after the UK is scheduled to leave.\n\nAuditors expressed concern that the DHSC did not know how many of the UK\u2019s 24,000 nursing homes and other social care providers, many of which are small businesses, had followed its advice on \u201crobust\u201d contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe department has done a great deal of work to prepare for a no-deal exit. However, there remains a significant amount to do before 31 October,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn the event of a no-deal exit, the department would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hugely demanding task.\u201d\n\nThe department estimates that by the end of March 2020 it will have spent more than \u00a387m securing continued supplies, while the Department for Transport (DfT) has been allocated \u00a3150m to procure additional freight capacity, mainly for health and social care needs.\n\nBut while the DHSC has said it needs the equivalent of 2,326 additional HGV spaces a week, the NAO said the time left was \u201cextremely limited\u201d if the shipping contingency was to be fully ready by 31 October.\n\nThe health ministry is setting up its own courier service for transporting particularly urgent goods. This system will not be tested until 24 October, although the department has said it is expected to be ready for service from 1 November.\n\nWarehouse space has been rented for manufacturers to stockpile medicines and materials for clinical suppliers, with capacity for 48,000 pallets, the report said. Pharmaceutical suppliers have been advised to build up six weeks of supplies of medicines that come from the EU, but auditors said it had \u201cincomplete information\u201d about the levels of stockpiling.\n\nProf Alan Boyd, the Brexit spokesperson for the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said the report was \u201creally worrying\u201d.\n\n\u201cVery little thought has been given to securing basic medical supplies such as bedpans and incontinence pads for people in social care in nursing homes. Bluntly, that means the frail, the elderly and most vulnerable could be hit the hardest,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the DHSC said \u201csubstantial\u201d stockpiles of medicines had been built up and were \u201cincreasing by the day\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe want to reassure patients we are doing everything necessary to make sure they can access the medicines they need after Brexit on 31 October,\u201d they said.", "description": "NAO says data does not show that health services will be ready if UK leaves EU next month", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0dd8a76b4ae6cbdf6de23b1a20d1875104965c2/586_674_1978_1187/master/1978.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=966785f67d9014c8daec07c906190cb1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
