(AP) - Each year Kansas\u2019 basketball season kick-off, dubbed Late Night in the Phog, promises a festive night filled with musical performances, skits and scrimmages, building excitement to match the lofty expectations for the upcoming season.\n\nHowever, this year anticipation eagerly surrounded not only an appearance by Snoop Dogg, but also whether Kansas\u2019 recent notice of allegations from the NCAA would dampen the mood.\n\nJust 11 days prior to the 35th-annual Late Night in the Phog, the University received notice of three alleged Level 1 violations, tied chiefly to recruiting and including a responsibility charge against coach Bill Self, garnering national attention.\n\nFollowing a choreographed performance by the men\u2019s basketball team and Rock Chalk Dancers that brought the fans to their feet, a video captioned \u201cThe Bill Self Era\u201d exploded onto the screen, touting highlights of the Hall of Fame coach\u2019s storied career at Kansas, sending the crowd into an uproar.\n\nWith 16,300 fans packed into Allen Fieldhouse on Friday night, Self took to the court, directly addressing the mass of students, fans and recruits with nod to the alleged violations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from some people that bad publicity is better than no publicity,\u201d Self said with a chuckle. \u201cI actually don\u2019t believe that for a second but it felt good to say.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the \u201cchoppy waters\u201d the program currently faces, Self beamed, amidst \u201cBill\u201d chants in the student section, that he had never in his 17-year tenure been more proud to coach at Kansas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt that we could have more support from an administration than we do here at Kansas. I\u2019ve never felt we could have more support from an athletics department than we do at Kansas,\u201d Self said. \u201cWe have the best fans in the world and I never felt we could have more support from our fans than we do here at the University of Kansas.\u201d\n\nHaving addressed the impending allegations, Self then turned his attention to his team, speaking highly of the season ahead. Returning several key players and having brought in a highly-touted recruiting class, Self\u2019s great expectations for his program have far from waivered.\n\n\u201cI think your expectations should be off the charts for this year\u2019s team,\u201d Self said.\n\nMany having camped within the halls and on the lawn of Allen Fieldhouse throughout the week for an opportunity to watch the event, students and fans voraciously applauded Self as he ended his roughly four-minute speech.\n\nFollowing Self\u2019s passionate address, spirits continued to lift as former player Sherron Collins drained a half-court shot to earn two students $5,000 apiece at the expense of Self, sending the entire team into a dog pile on top of the former National Champion.\n\nAfter the dog pile subsided, the names of the Kansas roster boomed over the speakers as the 2018-19 Jayhawks prepared to take the court for the first time in a short intersquad scrimmage, garnering yet another standing ovation from the rowdy crowd as each player danced onto the court.\n\nDevon Dotson lead the way for Kansas in the brief scrimmage, knocking down 4 of 8 field goals, including two from beyond the arc, in a 12-point outing, followed by David McCormack with 10 points.\n\nTo cap off the evening, this year\u2019s cross-generational music guest Snoop Dogg rapped alongside the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams, dawning a Kansas jersey of his own with \u201cSnoop\u201d across the back as he performed hits including \u201cSmoke Weed Everyday\u201d and \u201cGin and Juice\u201d.\n\nUltimately, the looming shadow of recent allegations plaguing Kansas appeared to have no ill effect on the excitement surrounding the high expectations for this Jayhawks team, if anything amplifying the anticipation. With Late Night in the books and practice officially underway, Kansas will open its season Oct. 24 with an exhibition matchup against Fort Hays State in Allen Fieldhouse.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Each year Kansas' basketball season kick-off, dubbed Late Night in the Phog, promises a festive night filled with musical performances, skits and scrimmages, building excitement to match the lofty expectations for the upcoming season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Maddy Tannahill"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
