This was worse than the 55.0 expected by economists.\n\nFollowing the report, stock markets plunged with the Dow (^DJI) dropping by as much as 335 points or 1.3%.\n\nEarlier this week, we learned that the ISM manufacturing index fell to a ten-year low of 47.8 in September from 49.1 the month prior. A reading below 50 signals contraction.\n\nWhile the services index continues to signal expansion, albeit at a decelerating rate, the services sector represents a much bigger part of the economy. This is illustrated clearly in the chart below from Credit Suisse.\n\nThe U.S. services sector is much bigger than the manufacturing sector.
