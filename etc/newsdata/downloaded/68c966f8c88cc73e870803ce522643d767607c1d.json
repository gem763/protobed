(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday that he will refuse to cooperate with the House Democrats conducting a formal impeachment investigation into the president\u2019s conduct.\n\nGiuliani said his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee would be contingent on the removal of its chairman, Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), whom Trump has accused of running a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t testify in front of that committee until there is a vote of Congress and he [Schiff] is removed,\u201d Giuliani told the Washington Post. \u201cThe position I\u2019m stating is now the position of the administration.\u201d\n\nThe former New York City mayor added that he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d any other member of the Trump administration testifying before Schiff\u2019s committee.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham invited Giuliani to appear before his committee, a possibility Giuliani said he would entertain.\n\nGraham said he has heard \u201cdisturbing allegations by Rudy Giuliani about corruption in Ukraine\u201d and would like to hear Giuliani elaborate on those concerns.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would welcome testimony from such a major player in the controversy surrounding Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe welcome Mr. Giuliani testifying,\u201d Schumer wrote in a tweet. \u201cGiven the apparent depth of his involvement in the president\u2019s effort to convince foreign governments to investigate a political rival, he must testify under oath.\u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s remarks come after the Trump administration said it would block Gordon Sondland, the U. S. ambassador to the European Union and a key witness in the impeachment probe, from giving testimony to investigators for three House committees.\n\n\u201cBy preventing us from hearing from this witness and obtaining these documents, the president and secretary of state are taking actions that prevent us from getting the facts needed to protect the nation\u2019s security,\u201d Schiff said of the administration\u2019s decision.", "description": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday that he will refuse to cooperate with the House Democrats conducting a formal impeachment investigation into the president's conduct.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
