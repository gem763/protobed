Stay as calm as you can and help them by carefully restraining them and then you want to open their mouth which is sometimes easier done with two people.\n\n\"And only do this if you are confident you are not putting yourself at risk.\n\n\"You would open their mouth and check inside to see if there was anything obvious. Which you would just check to see if there's anything obvious.\"\n\n\"Don't be tempted to put your fingers in and sweep around unless there is something very obvious that you can see. And it might be easier to use tweesers/forceps to remove anything\".\n\n(Image: First Aid for Life)\n\n(Image: First Aid For Life)\n\n\"For a small dog, you would turn them fully upside down, and grab them by their thighs then gently shake them.\n\n\"For larger dogs it's important to get them into a position were gravity would help.\"\n\nLarger dogs need to be titled onto their front legs, with the head facing down, in a sort of wheel barrow position.\n\nGravity will help to then dislodge the object, but if your dog is wretching or coughing and this hasn't worked, then the next step is the Heimlich Manouvre.\n\n(Image: First Aid For Life)\n\n(Image: First Aid for Life)\n\n\"If you look down their chest their is a natural gap after their ribs, and it's in that gap that you put your hands.\"\n\n\"You need to put the thumb part of your first up underneath the abdomen, and the other hand placed over that first, you need to pull upwards towards her chest.\"\n\n\"You would do that up to five times and hopefully that will dislodge the item. If that hasn't worked get the animal to a vet, and even if it has get your dog checked out quickly.\"\n\nWhat to do if your dog is unconscious and not breathing\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIf your dog is unconscious and not breathing, you should proceed with caution.\n\nEmma explains: \"If you suspect a dog is unconscious, proceed with extreme caution, particularly if it's not your dog.\"\n\nAn injured dog is far more likely to bite you and they may not be unconscious so be careful.\n\n\"Approach them from behind. You start by touching them with the back of the foot first, and speak to them aswell. So you're not kicking them your just touching them gently.\n\n\"You would then touch them with the back of your hand. It's far less invasive than the front of your hand.\"\n\n\"Keep looking for any kind of response at all, and if there's no response then you need to open their airway.\"\n\n\n\nOnly approach or come to the aid a dog that is your own or that you have permission to help.\n\nIf it's not your animal please do not perform CPR, first aid, or anything intrusive on them without the permission of the owner.\n\n\"So if this is your animal or if you have permission to help, you would then have a look and see if there's anything obvious that has caused a problem,\" Emma says.\n\n\"So [the] dog is unconscious, you would NEVER do this on a dog that is conscious without extreme caution.\n\n\"Carefully open up the mouth and ease the tongue forward, because the tongue when they are unconscious will roll back on itself.\n\n(Image: First Aid for Life)\n\n\"So they are unconscious and you need to see if they are breathing. If they are unconscious but breathing then put them into the recovery position. So extend the airways and get them to veterinary care fast\"\n\nEmma recommends using a piece of hair to see if the dog is expelling breath if you are unsure.\n\nTo help your dog breathe, you can blow in through their nose.\n\nGuards are available to cover the nose area but you can proceed without one.\n\nIf the dog is unconscious and not breathing you need to hold the nose and jaw together.\n\nThen while not breathing your full breath [as our lungs are larger than a dogs] breathe one breath every three seconds, and do five breaths initially, into the nose area.\n\nIf you feel a pulse but your dog is still not breathing, increase to twenty breaths.\n\n(Image: First Aid for Life)\n\nIf your dog still isn't breathing, you'll need to do chest compressions.\n\nFor the majority of dogs, you go just behind the front legs where the heart is positioned, for a whippet it's slightly more on their triangle, and for bull dogs and pug types you're better rolling onto their back.\n\nContinue in the ratio of thirty compressions to two breaths. If the dog has not regained consciousness after 3-5 minutes, advice from The Blue Cross says it is unlikely they will make a full recovery.\n\nHowever, doing all you can to help your dog whilst waiting for a vet gives them the best chance of survival.\n\n(Image: First Aid for Life)\n\nSo you can teach a dog owner new tricks after all.\n\nFor more information on helping a pet in peril, visit First Aid For Pets .\n\nYou can also take nurse Emma's free E-course, with lots of free tips on keeping your pet from harm here at - https://firstaidforpets.net/free-dog-choking-course/", "description": "Emma Hammet, the author of First Aid for Dogs, explains what to do if you think your dog is choking or is unconscious and not breathing and even how to give it CPR", "authors": ["Hannah Dodd", "Image", "First Aid For Life"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714671.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_DOG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
