She loves video games, art, and makeup, so she combines those things to express herself, resulting in intricate paintings where her body is the canvas. White\u2019s talent is immediately clear, and yet, she has courted no small amount of controversy for simply doing her thing. Some viewers insist her art is nothing more than a Trojan horse for illicit nudity on Twitch.\n\nWhite, who studied art in two different universities in England and Scotland before becoming a Twitch streamer, did not see any of this coming when she first got started. She was content to largely stream video games until Twitch opened the floodgates for \u201cIRL\u201d channels back in 2016, at which point she decided to try face-painting, themed around characters from games like World of Warcraft. It was a natural progression\u2014makeup, she told Kotaku at TwitchCon earlier this month, has always been a core part of her identity.\n\n\u201cThat just made me feel like the best version of myself. Ever since then, I\u2019ve been trying crazy makeup.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a very awkward-looking kid,\u201d White said. \u201cI found myself with a bunch of friends who listened to heavy metal and wore big, black makeup and really out-there clothing. That just made me feel like the best version of myself. Ever since then, I\u2019ve been trying crazy makeup.\u201d\n\nAfter making it to the finals of a major makeup competition but ultimately failing to win, White decided she wanted to up her game, resulting in her more elaborate works on Twitch. These sometimes involve painting not just her face, but large portions of her body. White said the process is not entirely dissimilar from painting on canvas, except she\u2019s looking in a mirror, so everything is reversed. This makes things like calligraphy a nightmare, she said, but mostly, it\u2019s about training your eyes. Well, that and having the mental fortitude to power through painting sessions that sometimes last as long as 15 hours.\n\nPhoto: Sophia \u201cDjarii\u201d White\n\nEven for White, whose bread and butter is putting paint on surfaces as naturally as regular people put butter on bread, this can take a toll. \u201cIt can be very exhausting mentally,\u201d she said. \u201cMakeup and any art is an intimate and personal thing that it\u2019s sometimes hard to share with the world. There are so many judgements and critiques, and sometimes you can\u2019t take Jimmy in chat over there telling you that your painting style just isn\u2019t really up to his taste.\u201d\n\nThese days, Twitch is about far more than just games. There is, however, still a perception among portions of the Twitch community that anyone who steps outside the realm of pure video game streaming is leeching off the hard-won success of gamers. This goes double for any woman found to be committing the Twitch crimes of a) existing and b) having a body.\n\nOver the years, multiple controversies have erupted around this, including debates over so-called \u201ctitty streamers\u201d showing skin, battles over whether or not women are using sex appeal to steal viewers from men, suspensions for relatively modest cosplay, and outrage at breastfeeding on stream.\n\nBody painting was an early target for these sorts of tirades because it represented one of the first instances in which Twitch explicitly allowed a degree of nudity, typically from women. It remains a popular target for angry users to call out as proof of their conspiracy theory that Twitch has become an infernal amplification engine for women\u2019s deceptive wiles.\n\nWhite, as one of Twitch\u2019s most popular body painters, receives more of this abuse than most. Given that there is nothing intrinsically sexual about her work, she\u2019s disheartened by this response, but not exactly surprised.\n\n\u201cThey think it\u2019s really sexual because they think a woman\u2019s body is inherently sexual\u2014which it is not,\u201d she said. \u201cContext is a very, very important thing. I would say that body painting leaves as much to your imagination as a tight T-shirt does. Most people who tune in don\u2019t necessarily notice that it\u2019s a paint for a while, because their brains don\u2019t even recognise it.\u201d\n\nWhite\u2019s goal is to set an example that viewers and haters alike can learn from, so that things will be better on Twitch not just for her, but for the whole community of streamers who specialise in makeup and body painting.\n\n\u201cI prefer just to educate people on what is and isn\u2019t sexual and why context is very important in this matter,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also that being sexual is not a bad thing at all. If you don\u2019t like that part of Twitch, then just don\u2019t watch those channels.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all body painting includes the entire body, nor is it only on a woman,\u201d White said. \u201cThere are male body painters as well, and you don\u2019t see the same comments flying toward those guys.\u201d White will sometimes just do face painting, or paint down to her shoulders, or further down her torso. \u201cAll of them are the same as far as sexuality goes, which is non-existent in any way, shape, or form,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are ways to get sexuality across that are much easier than spending 15 hours to paint yourself to look like something that isn\u2019t really sexual at all.\u201d\n\nThese days, her audience includes many converted sceptics. \u201cOften, I hear \u2018I wasn\u2019t a fan of this whole body painting thing, but I\u2019ve really opened my eyes to it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are ways to get sexuality across that are much easier than spending 15 hours to paint yourself to look like something that isn\u2019t really sexual at all.\u201d\n\nBeyond the art of body painting, a woman\u2019s choice of makeup (or to not wear any) can often raise the hackles of Twitch\u2019s primarily male audience.\n\nJust look at the overblown outraged and derisive response to top streamer Imane \u201cPokimane\u201d Anys\u2019 decision to go without makeup at the start of a stream last year. After many users mocked Anys\u2019 makeup-less appearance and pointed to this as an example of women using makeup to deceive men, other women streamers also went without makeup in a show of solidarity.\n\nIn her time as a makeup-focused streamer, White has found that people often view makeup as some kind of trick. She wishes people could just be \u201ckinder,\u201d and said that she thinks Anys is \u201cbeautiful\u201d with or without makeup. But also, she believes, that\u2019s not really what last year\u2019s big makeup blowup was really about. Some viewers freaked out because they realised that what Anys did in that moment wasn\u2019t for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a trick. It\u2019s not for anyone else,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for any dude who I\u2019m trying to impress, you know? People need to remember that we do things for ourselves\u2014not for the men who think, \u2018Ah, I\u2019m being tricked.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto: Sophia \u201cDjarii\u201d White\n\nWhite loves what she does, and finds new angles from which to approach it. This year, she put together a look inspired by Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d painting, which involved painting with latex so as to recreate the painting\u2019s almost raised-off-the-canvas textured effect, something White had \u201cnever seen before\u201d in body painting. It\u2019s now one of the works of which she is most proud, she said.\n\nBut, she said, there\u2019s still nothing quite like doing body paintings of video game characters that have \u201csignificance\u201d to her. \u201cI do a lot of World of Warcraft ones because that game has been a big, big part of my life for the past 11 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words. It\u2019s just so badass. When you\u2019ve painted yourself as Sylvanas Windrunner, The Banshee Queen, and you just look so amazing, it\u2019s like, wow. It just feels great.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just love that people will look at me and be like, \u2018Wow, your makeup is really spectacular!\u2019 That makes me feel so proud and so happy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I love the world to see me.\u201d", "description": "The equation underlying Sophia \u201cDjarii\u201d White\u2019s Twitch stream is really pretty simple.
