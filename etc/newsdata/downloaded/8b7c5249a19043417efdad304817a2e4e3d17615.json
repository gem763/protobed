Police finally escorted her into a black sedan four hours after the event ended.\n\n\n\n\n\nA man, one of about 150 people picked via lottery after more than 20,000 people applied to attend, asks a question to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other government officials (not pictured) during a town hall meeting at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong on Thursday.

Critics at the time said she was out of step with the expectations and focus of the protesters, who have come to be more concerned about police use of force and are again demanding direct elections for Hong Kong leaders.\n\nMore than 20,000 applied to take part in the dialogue, and of those, 150 were randomly selected to participate. Of the 30 people chosen to speak, more than 20 were critical of authorities and supportive of protesters.\n\nThe flavor of the event was clear from the outset. Police had planned various routes to bring Lam into and out of the stadium, a 3,500-seat indoor sports arena in the Wan Chai district, after forums online discussed blocking her path. Riot police carting cases full of crowd-control equipment were seen filing into the stadium in the afternoon. Police presence in the area was heavy, and schools allowed students to leave early in anticipation of clashes.\n\nLam began the dialogue session by telling attendees that it was not a mere public relations exercise and that it was \u201ctime to communicate.\u201d She was flanked by other members of her government, including the secretary of home affairs and the secretary of constitutional and mainland affairs, who is responsible for managing Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with China.\n\nAlthough Beijing has upped the threats and rhetoric around the protests, it has largely been up to Hong Kong police to suppress dissent that has sometimes spiraled into violence. Hong Kong\u2019s police force, once among the most respected in Asia, has been accused of using unreasonable force against protesters.\n\nHuman rights groups and U.N. officials \u2014 along with many Hong Kong residents, including some in the pro-Beijing camp \u2014 have called for a fully independent investigation of the police department.\n\nLam, however, continues to insist that the Independent Police Complaints Council is up to the task, an assertion she repeated in the face of criticism Thursday. But there is deep distrust of the organization, which lacks the ability to call witnesses and which critics think is staffed by officials loyal to Lam.\n\n\u201cA commission of inquiry is one way to find out the truth,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cBut we should give the Independent Police Complaints Council a chance to do their job first.\u201d\n\nChants from the protesters gathered outside the stadium were so loud that they could, at times, be heard inside. Among the demonstrators was a 45-year-old salesman who decried the dialogue as a \u201cshow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot trust the government,\u201d said the man, who wanted to be identified only as Li. \u201cIt is useless to talk to our dishonest chief executive.\u201d\n\nLi added that he will be among those protesting on Tuesday, the anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Large protests are planned over the weekend and on the day itself, as protesters seek to make clear that they reject Beijing\u2019s tight control over their city, which was promised significant autonomy when the British handed it over in 1997.\n\nThose freedoms were meant to be preserved for 50 years, until 2047, and questions remain about what the next steps will be for Hong Kong. One speaker on Thursday put it to Lam this way: \u201cYou will be 90 by 2047, so it won\u2019t matter to you by then. But I am 26 now and will be 55 in 2047. Do we have a future then?\u201d\n\nLam concluded the Thursday session by promising more conversation and pledged to work to restore trust in her government. But questions have surfaced about whether she is truly in charge, and officials have acknowledged that they have limited room to maneuver in the face of a more assertive Beijing, which insists on no further concessions to the movement.\n\nThe reality of Lam\u2019s difficult position, between Beijing and her own people, was not missed by dialogue participants.\n\n\u201cWe all know you are not in charge,\u201d said one man who was wearing a black mask. \u201cSo, there\u2019s really not much to say.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll just come back\u2019: Hong Kong protesters push on despite sweep of pro-democracy murals\n\nUnidentified flinching object: In Hong Kong protests, police wage assault on facts\n\nHong Kong protests threaten to rain on China\u2019s anniversary parade\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Carrie Lam kick-started a dialogue with randomly selected city residents, part of concessions she hopes will calm unrest, now in its 17th week", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Tiffany Liang"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ObXOLbKD6URv3eHsbHL-tc1PSEc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AQD7MAHAMQI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg"}
