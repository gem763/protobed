By law, the clerk\u2019s office has 10 days to file the indictment, a spokeswoman for Esparza said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler)", "description": "Patrick Crusius, 21, was indicted for capital murder and will face the death penalty if he is convicted, El Paso County District Attorney Jaime Esparza said in a statement.  \"The District Attorney's Office will continue to work hard to ensure that justice is done and is committed to assisting", "authors": ["Brendan O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z0rbrfZ8Jo0PDcEvw88vFQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/215e9ea7ecc629e6dda4636bad798286", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
