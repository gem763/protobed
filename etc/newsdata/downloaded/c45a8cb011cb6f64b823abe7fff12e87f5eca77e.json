The national team are into their first final for 12 years but the manner in which Eddie Jones\u2019s side left New Zealand strewn on the canvas was as striking as the 19-7 scoreline. The All Blacks\u2019 dreams of becoming the first team to win three consecutive Webb Ellis Cups were not so much dashed as smashed.\n\nAs well as delivering New Zealand\u2019s first loss in 19 World Cup matches dating back to the 2007 quarter-finals, this was the equal of any England performance in modern times. The All Blacks, so dominant in the tournament en route to the last four, could cope with neither the power at England\u2019s disposal nor their defensive strength and tactical acumen after Manu Tuilagi\u2019s second-minute score had set the initial tone.\n\nEngland v New Zealand: Rugby World Cup 2019, semi-final \u2013 live! Read more\n\nEngland\u2019s forwards knew they would have to play the collective game of their lives and duly did so. Maro Itoje was everywhere and along with Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Courtney Lawes delivered a world-class performance when it mattered most. George Ford, taking over the kicking duties from a limping Owen Farrell, kicked four vital penalties and, when the inevitable All Black fightback finally materialised, some of England\u2019s tackling, particularly from Underhill, was off the scale.\n\nAs an advert for rugby the entire game more than lived up to its advance billing. From the moment England formed their own deliberate V-shaped arrowhead to greet the haka, encroaching slightly into the Kiwi half for extra effect, there was an edge to proceedings and the opening minutes saw a similar statement of intent.\n\nIt took England less than 98 seconds to made their intentions crystal clear, a superb attacking sequence ending with Tuilagi plunging unstoppably over by the posts. Farrell\u2019s conversion made it 7-0 and it was a full seven minutes before New Zealand could take anything remotely resembling a breath.\n\nThe sight of the diminutive Ford stripping the All Black tighthead Nepo Laulala perfectly symbolised England\u2019s intent and it was the team in white who dominated virtually the entire first half. Even the multitalented Beauden Barrett looked slightly rattled and New Zealand were fortunate not to concede a second try when Tuilagi intercepted an attempted long pass from the full-back. When the ball arrived in Jonny May\u2019s hands on the wing 40 metres out there seemed only one outcome but the winger, who came off with a tweaked muscle against Australia in the quarter-final, could not outpace the cover on this occasion.\n\nThe All Blacks has another let-off when Underhill, having collected Kyle Sinckler\u2019s pass, charged over for a potential score which was subsequently chalked off because Tom Curry\u2019s decoy run had illegally cleared a defender from his path. Only with a limping Farrell clearly in discomfort did England\u2019s momentum slow momentarily but they still spent more than two-thirds of the opening half in their opponents\u2019 territory and mostly forced New Zealand\u2019s dangerous backs to live off scraps. A 45-metre penalty from Ford extended England\u2019s interval lead to 10-0 and left Steve Hansen\u2019s team staring into the abyss.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England players celebrate after Manu Tuilagi\u2019s try.

As long ago as last November, after his side\u2019s 16-15 defeat to New Zealand at Twickenham, the head coach was already making clear exactly how England would handle any rematch in Japan. \u201cIf you\u2019re prepared to play a certain way against the All Blacks \u2013 and you can do it very well \u2013 you can make them uncomfortable. That hasn\u2019t changed since Adam was a boy.\u201d\n\nThis blank first half, even so, was noteworthy as the All Blacks\u2019 first at a World Cup since they lost their 1991 semi-final to Australia. Their predicament could have been even worse had England not had another potentially match-clinching try ruled out in the 46th minute, this time for a slight knock forward in the preceding maul before Ben Youngs dummied his way over for what would have been an outstanding finish.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nA 50th-minute penalty from Ford made partial amends, only for an English lineout aberration close to their own line to gift Ardie Savea a soft 57th-minute try, converted by Richie Mo\u2019unga. Could the All Blacks, who had previously lost just nine of the 105 Test matches they had played under Hansen, possibly escape and deny England a winner-takes-all date with either South Africa or Wales?\n\nThe answer was no, two more Ford penalties propelling the English chariot sweetly into next Saturday\u2019s final.", "description": "England are back in the Rugby World Cup final after ending the All Blacks\u2019 12-year unbeaten run in the tournament 19-7, taking the lead inside 98 seconds with a Manu Tuilagi try", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9a73dfa30dc25bc846ab8b5ba61d20ef2036f8/0_119_4793_2875/master/4793.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=134fa416671ac6e5f24279833e648413", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
