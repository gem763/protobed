Smith was spared because he was working in Alaska at the time. Still, the experience shook him. He left commercial trawling behind and switched to oyster farming.\n\nThen in 2011, \u201cHurricane Irene came,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd Hurricane Sandy the next year.\u201d Intense storm surges, fueled by global warming, buried his bivalves and destroyed his equipment.\n\nDiscussions about climate change have often focused on its terrestrial impacts: the killer heatwaves, wildfire, desiccated forests and depleted farmland. But global warming is affecting the oceans as well, heating them up and changing their chemistry so rapidly that it\u2019s diminishing seafood supplies and triggering stronger, wetter tropical storms, United Nations scientists recently warned.\n\n\u201cI was told climate change would be a slow lobster boil,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAfter the storms, I realized it was already here. It\u2019s here and now.\u201d\n\nSo Smith became one of a growing number of activists, policymakers and climate scientists working toward a plan that aims not only to protect the oceans but also to help slow the snowballing effects of global warming that threaten to wreck the planet. Along the way, they want to create more jobs in ocean conservation, offshore energy and seaside tourism. Modeled after the Green New Deal, these conservationists are calling their plan a \u201cBlue New Deal\u201d for the ocean.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, we\u2019re either looking at the ocean as a problem space,\u201d Smith said, \u201cor we see it as the victim \u2014 of acidification, of overfishing, of changing water temperatures, of bleached coral reefs.\u201d\n\nHis version of a Blue New Deal reimagines the \u201cocean as a protagonist and as a place where we can build real climate solutions,\u201d Smith said. The proposal, which Smith drafted along with marine biologist Ayana Johnson and Chad Nelsen of the nonprofit Surfrider Foundation, emphasizes restoring and replanting coastlines.\n\nWetlands, seagrasses and mangroves can absorb up to five times more carbon per acre than a rainforest, Johnson explained. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t that be a great opportunity for a jobs program?\u201d she said. \u201cWe could have a conservation corps of young people that just go out and plant stuff.\u201d\n\nThe plan also champions a model of ocean farming that Smith developed after losing all his oysters. The aquatic gardens he rebuilt off the coast of Connecticut include seaweed, which absorbs carbon, and shellfish, which absorb nitrogen. Besides absorbing greenhouse gases, he said his gardens are good for the climate because they help to restore the wider marine ecosystem. And they\u2019re good business, he said, because they can float and bob through storms\n\nSmith now runs the nonprofit GreenWave, which helps fishers across the country and around the world plan their own ocean gardens. He recounts his meandering journey from trawl fisherman to ocean entrepreneur in his 2019 book, \u201cEat Like a Fish.\u201d\n\nRonald Gautreau Jr. for GreenWave Smith harvests oysters from his Thimble Island Ocean Farm off Branford, Connecticut.\n\nOcean farms are \u201cjust one little idea,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMy thought is: Let\u2019s bundle together and support a thousand climate solutions because they\u2019re out there.\u201d\n\nThe Blue New Deal that Smith helped write is one of several similar efforts to articulate what such a proposal could include. Others have suggested investing in offshore wind farms and tidal energy, setting higher air quality standards for ships, and promoting hybrid and hydrogen-fueled vessels.\n\nThe activist group Blue Frontier has gone a step further to also propose flood insurance reform and programs to help people who live in flood-prone areas relocate to higher ground. More than 40% of Americans live along or near the coast, and coastal communities generate nearly half of the United States\u2019 GDP \u2015 about $8 trillion.\n\n\u201cWhen the best available science is giving us the worst possible scenarios for the ocean, we just have to do something,\u201d said Blue Frontier\u2019s founder, David Helvarg.\n\nIn a bid to gain the support of all presidential candidates for its Ocean Climate Action Plan, Blue Frontier invited scientists, fish and shellfish farmers, government officials and activists to a summit last week to refine the proposal. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of the tools and a lot of the solutions, but so far we\u2019ve lacked the political will to do anything about it,\u201d Helvarg said.\n\nPart of the problem \u201cis that oceans are sort of out of sight, out of mind,\u201d he said. \u201cMany Americans only think about the ocean when they\u2019re on a beach vacation.\u201d\n\nThat may be starting to change.\n\nDuring CNN\u2019s climate crisis town hall for Democratic presidential candidates last month, Smith had the opportunity to question one of the front-runners, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cThose of us that work on the water, we need climate solutions and we need them now,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe trouble is, is the Green New Deal only mentions our oceans one time. ... So what\u2019s your plan for a Blue New Deal for those of us working on the oceans?\u201d\n\nWarren quickly promised her support. \u201cI think he\u2019s got it exactly right. We need a Blue New Deal as well,\u201d she said.\n\nSmith is waiting for her \u2014 and every other lawmaker \u2014 to get on it.\n\nIf it matters to you, it matters to us.
