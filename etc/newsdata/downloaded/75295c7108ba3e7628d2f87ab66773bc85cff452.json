The attack cut off 6 percent of daily global oil output. That\u2019s a big deal. As the Financial Times\u2019s Gideon Rachman observed: \u201cFor decades, any list of global geopolitical risks will have had \u2018attack on Saudi oil facilities\u2019 near the top. Now it has happened. \u2026 The key decision-makers in this particular drama \u2014 Donald Trump, the US president, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and the leadership of Iran \u2014 are all headstrong and prone to taking risks.\u201d\n\nTo be fair to Trump, his first response to the attack was to suggest a release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to calm markets \u201cif needed.\u201d This was actually a pretty sensible signal, as the reserve was designed for this kind of contingency.\n\nThen things started to go downhill on Trump\u2019s Twitter feed:\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nPLENTY OF OIL! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nBecause we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you, Mr. President!), we are a net Energy Exporter, & now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nA good rule of thumb is that \u201cREMAIN CALM\u201d tweets from Trump have pretty much the opposite effect. Oil markets did not react well to Trump\u2019s all-over-the-map response.\n\nThis is not just a foreign policy crisis for Trump. A spike in oil prices could send a U.S. economy already gripped by uncertainty into a recession. A military escalation with Iran would have virtually the same effect, and the administration\u2019s rhetoric certainly seems to tilt in that direction. From Trump\u2019s tweets to State Department official Brian Hook analogizing the attack to 9/11, the administration sounds locked and loaded.\n\nMonday was a roller coaster of Trump officials sounding hawkish and Trump himself sounding less hawkish. Predicting what the administration will do is a fool\u2019s errand. What seems worth pointing out, however, is just how bad the U.S. position looks on the Middle East chessboard.\n\nWhy? Three reasons. First, this crisis has hit the administration at a moment when it is seriously understaffed. There is no replacement for John Bolton as national security adviser. There is no confirmed replacement for Daniel Coats as director of national intelligence. They are already scraping the bottom of the bottom of the barrel. Hook is the State Department\u2019s point person on Iran, and he has been otherwise busy sending emails worthy of Nigerian scammers to Iranian ship captains. Expecting this crew to do anything properly is trusting hope over history.\n\nSecond, this administration has zero credibility in its claims of who might be responsible for the attack. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Dion Nissenbaum, Summer Said and Jared Malsin reported that the United States told Saudi Arabia it thought \u201cIran was the staging ground\u201d for the attacks, but the Saudis seemed far less sure. Even if the Saudis were to trust administration officials, it is not clear that anyone else would. Trump\u2019s deference to the Saudis has already aggravated Congress. The administration\u2019s lack of transparency on intelligence issues ranging from 5G to, say, Mohammed\u2019s role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi does not inspire confidence in any of its public pronouncements.\n\nTo be clear: I am not saying that Iran did not play a role in the attack. I am saying this administration has dissembled so frequently on so many issues (including whether the president would talk to Iran\u2019s leadership without preconditions) that I see no reason to believe their motivated claims on this issue.\n\nThe third and most disturbing revelation about this crisis is just how little credibility Trump has to deter further attacks. As Politico\u2019s Nahal Toosi noted, \u201cthe latest crisis exposed a major conundrum in Trump\u2019s foreign policy: The president and his aides have sent conflicting signals on what, if anything, the U.S. will do to defend its Arab allies in the Middle East when it comes to Iran.\u201d\n\nThis is a real problem. Trump\u2019s threats in the region (or anywhere else) are not taken seriously. Trump\u2019s inability to credibly commit to anything makes it impossible to deter Iran or any other actor in the region. This does not mean that the United States will not retaliate if provoked again. It does mean that it would be understandable if regional actors did not share that belief based on Trump\u2019s past behavior, which increases the chances of blundering into conflict.\n\nThe odds are excellent that my colleagues Elizabeth Saunders and Michael Horowitz are correct, and war with Iran is not likely to occur. Still, as this crisis evolves, it will do so with a broken national security policymaking process, diminished U.S. credibility, no evidence of U.S. resolve and an Iran policy that is the worst of all possible worlds.\n\nOther than that, I am sure everything will work out great.", "description": "Why Trump has mutilated any coherent response to the crisis in the Persian Gulf.", "authors": ["Daniel W.
