Inflation has been at or above the central bank\u2019s 2% target for much of the past two years and was 2.9% year-on-year in August.\n\nThe central bank targets inflation at 2% with a tolerance band of one percentage point in both directions.\n\nBut the country is facing headwinds from a sharp slowdown affecting key trading partners, particularly Germany, which is on the edge of recession. The European Central Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve are loosening their monetary policies to counter rising risks from global trade tensions.\n\nThe Czech central bank board will assess risks to staff macroeconomic forecasts at its meeting on Wednesday. A quarterly update to the outlook is due in November.\n\n\u201cLong-term stability of rates is the most likely scenario, we can imagine one \u2018pre-emptive\u2019 cut in the second half of the next year should the euro zone slow down markedly,\u201d said Jakub Seidler, ING chief economist.\n\n\u201cThe crown will be the main factor making us expect no aggressive easing from the central bank in the next year.\u201d\n\nThe Czech currency EURCZK= has not met the central bank\u2019s expectations for strengthening in recent quarters, thus contributing to inflationary pressures in the domestic economy via prices of imports.\n\n(Graphic: Crown defies CNB outlook, here)", "description": "The Czech National Bank (CNB) is likely to hold interest rates unchanged through 2020 as it balances inflationary pressures at home with policy easing and economic weakness abroad, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
