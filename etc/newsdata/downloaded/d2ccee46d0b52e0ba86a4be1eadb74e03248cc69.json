In recent years, the EU has partnered with Libya's coast guard and other local groups to stem the dangerous sea crossings.\n\nRights groups, however, say those policies leave migrants at the mercy of armed groups or confined in squalid detention centers rife with abuses.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
