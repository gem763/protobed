Jerry Nadler in seeking the impeachment of President Trump.\n\nThat our president has weathered these false accusations shows his commitment to the American people in dismantling the left\u2019s corrupt criminal empire. Come next November, these fools must be held accountable for their irresponsible behavior. No other president in the history of this country has had to undergo this kind of abusive spying, deep-state resistance, unnamed accusers with invented accusations or the continued scream for impeachment since even before his election.\n\nThere is no longer any such thing as a moderate Democrat. The left knows its candidates will not beat President Trump at the ballot box, so impeachment is its only game plan for returning this country to tyranny. The reality is, President Trump is not the real target \u2014 \u201cWe, the People\u201d are. They hate us for having the temerity to challenge their corrupt stranglehold on the government and the rule of law. Next November, we will not forget what they\u2019ve attempted to do.\n\nAL QUARTARARO\n\nVirginia Beach, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
