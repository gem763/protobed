It's not an attack on you.", "language": "en", "text": "Listening to President Donald Trump's chief evangelical pastor ally, someone might get easily get confused about who, exactly, is the subject of the House Democrats' impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"I have never seen (evangelical Christians) more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this president from office, overturn the 2016 election and negate the votes of millions of evangelicals in the process,\" says Robert Jeffress, senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas and part of Trump's inner circle of evangelical supporters. \"If the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I\u2019m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.\u201d\n\nA reminder to my evangelical fellow citizens: The impeachment process is not targeting you.\n\nLoyalty and a persecution complex\n\nPart of the problem with the Trump phenomenon is the overly large degree to which his supporters identify with him and find validation in his ascent to the most powerful political position in the world.\n\nThis has induced a blind loyalty famously captured in the president's own words when he conjectured that he could shoot someone on a busy New York street and not lose voters. When The Washington Post asked the president of Liberty University whether there is anything that would endanger his and other evangelical leaders' support for Trump, Jerry Falwell Jr. gave an answer as revealing as it was brief: \"No.\"\n\nPolling data backs up Falwell\u2019s point: 80% of white evangelicals 45 and older say they view Trump favorably, about double the approval rating of the aggregate public.\n\nI thought Jesus was the only one who merited such devotion from Christians.\n\nIn the network of white evangelicals committed to Trump, iron-strong loyalty has a twin called \"persecution complex.\" You can hear its voice in the way the Christian Broadcasting Network celebrated its CBN News operation last week on the occasion of the network\u2019s 58th anniversary: \u201cGiving a voice to the forgotten and persecuted,\u201d the headline said. You can hear it, too, in Jeffress\u2019 bid to stoke grievances by calling the impeachment process an attempt to \"overturn\" the 2016 election and \"negate\" the votes of the evangelicals who voted for Trump.\n\nReject blind devotion to Trump\n\nWhere Jeffress sees an election being overturned and votes negated is hard to fathom. So Trump was barred from taking office in January 2017? Was stopped from appointing a pair of conservative justices to the Supreme Court? Never got his opportunity to yank the United States out of the Paris agreement on climate change mitigation?\n\nBy this logic, there could never be an impeachment. Never mind the fact that the framers put it in the Constitution.\n\nDon't blame incivility on religion: Christian principles are an antidote to nastiness.\n\nBut the untruthfulness of Jeffress\u2019 exaggerations isn't the half of it. In a time that calls for sober deliberation, his hot-headed, Civil War-spiked rhetoric is akin to spreading ultra-flammable kindling on a dry forest floor during fire season.\n\nIt's my hope that large numbers of evangelical Jesus followers reject such reckless nonsense and undiscerning devotion to Trump and get their eyes back on the prize. If any group has the spiritual resources to shift its ultimate allegiance from a feet-of-clay politician to someone worthy of veneration (aka God), it's evangelical Christians. After all, they're the ones who have been telling the rest of the country for decades now that their lives answer to a higher calling and are grounded in a deep faith. If God is their ultimate allegiance, then Trump is not.\n\nOur leaders are humans, not deities\n\nWhether we are conservative or liberal, religious or not, in this time or any other, we as Americans are called to maintain some healthy space between our hearts and our favorite politicians. We are citizens, not subjects. Our leaders are flawed human beings, not deities. Loyalty is an admirable quality in many circumstances. But when a human object of devotion violates just law and moral standards, it's time to break away and recommit to the \"something bigger\" that forms who we are: our faith, our principles, our conscience.", "description": "When a human object of devotion violates law and moral standards, it's time to break away and recommit to our faith, our principles, our conscience.", "authors": ["Tom Krattenmaker", "Opinion Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
