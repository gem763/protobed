The idea was that reducing the number of complex coverages would give the Redskins a chance to play more fundamentally sound defense than the unit did in Philadelphia to open the season.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to challenge them and make them earn their grass,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cUnfortunately, they did. We were a little bit more sound. We just didn\u2019t make many plays.\u201d\n\nThrough two games, Gruden said he sees no reason to \u201chit the panic button\u201d after beginning the season 0-2 for the first time since 2016. And on Monday, the Redskins stuck to that train of thought. Defensive coordinator Greg Manusky still has his job. Gruden walk-backed a previous comment about the coaching staff not reaching his players.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, there should be cause for alarm.\n\nNot including the result of the Jets-Browns game on \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d the Redskins have the second-worst defense in the league in terms of yards allowed. Only the hapless Miami Dolphins, who lost their first two games by a combined score of 102 to 10, have surrendered more.\n\nThe Redskins have given up 63 points and 910 yards. Their third-down defense, Gruden said, is \u201cnot good enough \u2014 in any league.\u201d\n\nWhen taking a look at every team\u2019s first two games to start a season, the Redskins defense is historically bad on third down. The Eagles and the Cowboys converted a combined 18 third downs on 28 opportunities, good for an eye-popping 64% conversion rate.\n\nThat number isn\u2019t just the worst in the team\u2019s history, since third-down data started being tracked in 1991 \u2014 it\u2019s the third-highest percentage of all-time.\n\nThe 1999 Browns, who finished 2-14, gave up about 66% (23 of 35) on third down, while the 2006 Houston Texans, who finished 6-10, conceded about 69% (17 of 25) of such plays. Again, these stats only factor in the first two games of every season, but history isn\u2019t on the Redskins\u2019 side when trying to turn things around. Right now, the Redskins\u2019 third-down problems boil down to a lack of pass rush.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not there,\u201d Gruden said. \u201d \u2026 Maybe we\u2019ve got to get some exotic looks to make the quarterback hold the ball a little bit longer to get home with the pressure. We\u2019ve got to rush the passer, for sure. I think that\u2019s the biggest challenge for our defensive line this week.\u201d\n\nThe inability to generate pressure is baffling, given the resources the team put into the defensive line over the past few years. Even with Jonathan Allen\u2019s knee injury, which kept him out against Dallas, the Redskins still have first-rounders Daron Payne and Montez Sweat upfront. Matt Ioannidis, who had 71/2 sacks last season, is an important contributor, too.\n\nBut so far, the Redskins have generated only two sacks, tied for the second-least in the league. According to Pro-Football-Reference, Washington has had just two quarterback hurries, three quarterback knockdowns and 10 blitzes. The Redskins prefer to generate pressure from the defensive line, but the unit hasn\u2019t been good enough.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, the Eagles\u2019 Carson Wentz and the Cowboys\u2018 Dak Prescott had their way with the Redskins. Together, they combined for a 124.8 passer rating \u2014 third highest in Redskins\u2019 history through two games.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the solution? Gruden said the Redskins have to \u201cplay better and demand more,\u201d but it\u2019s not that easy.\n\nSince the NFL implemented a 16-game schedule in 1978, just 38 of 323 teams \u2014 or about 12% \u2014 have made the playoffs that began the season 0-2.\n\nCornerback Aaron Colvin has done it before. Last season with the Houston Texans, Colvin, who was acquired last week, saw his team go from 0-3 to 11-5 with a nine-game winning streak in between. The Texans made the playoffs and lost in the AFC wild card game.\n\n\u201cI know that the media and the fans don\u2019t want hear that because they want to see, \u2018What can you do for me now?,\u2019\u201d Colvin said. \u201cBut in this locker room, we need to realize that it really isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
