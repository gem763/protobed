The league has been immersed in controversy ever since.\n\nTencent, the NBA\u2019s streaming partner, reduced its NBA schedule in the wake of the tweet and only showed the game between the Lakers and Clippers.\n\nCCTV said in a broadcast Saturday that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver should fear \u201cretribution\u201d for allegedly lying when he said Chinese officials asked him to fire Morey over the week. CCTV called it \"ugly for the president of an internationally influential sports league to openly make up a lie to discredit China,\u201d according to The New York Times. The broadcast added Silver\u2019s alleged lie showed he had character issues.\n\nCCTV\u2019s broadcast also blasted Silver's moral compass, saying \u201conce someone\u2019s morality goes wrong, he will receive retribution sooner or later\u201d and that \u201cfreedom of speech does not mean that it can be arbitrary nonsense.\u201d\n\nGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS' STEPHEN CURRY RESPONDS TO MICHAEL JORDAN'S HALL OF FAME REMARK\n\nThe state TV response came days after the NBA commissioner said at a Time Magazine event that the Chinese government urged him to fire Morey for the tweet but that he refused the request.\n\n\u201cWe made clear that we were being asked to fire him, by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe said there's no chance that's happening. There's no chance we'll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nSilver added: \u201cThese American values \u2014 we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go. And one of those values is free expression. We wanted to make sure that everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said no request was made of the commissioner.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\u201cWe especially went to the relevant departments to check on this claim,\u201d Geng told reporters in Beijing, according to Reuters. \u201cThe Chinese government has never made this kind of request.\u201d", "description": "As the NBA regular season tipped off in the United States and Canada, fans in China\u00a0were left in the dark, as state television decided against airing the games in the aftermath of a recent controversy stemming from a general manager's tweet supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
