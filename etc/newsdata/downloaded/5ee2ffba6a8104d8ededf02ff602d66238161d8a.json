Well, good things for investors, according to the latest take from Callum Thomas, head of research at Topdown Charts.\n\n\u201cSomething very interesting is happening right now in global equities, and most people have probably missed it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA set of unique indicators have put in some rare signals that are usually only seen at the start of a bull market.\u201d\n\nYes, he believes a new bull market is here.\n\n\u201cThis flies in the face of the current conventional wisdom that the global economy is heading into recession,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cso it\u2019s a bold statement.\u201d\n\nHe started with a look at this chart of the number of countries making 52-week stock-market highs, which just reached a level not seen in two years:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a classic bull market commencement signal, and we saw this at the start of the last 3 cyclical bull markets (2009-11, 2012-15, 2016-18),\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cIdeally we want to see more countries making new 52-week highs [and] basically for the strength to spread across markets and to maintain.\u201d\n\nNext, he pointed to an unusual indicator tracking the proportion of countries whose equity benchmarks are up at least 20% from annual lows.\n\n\u201cWhy would this be interesting?\u201d he asked. \u201cVery simply, it is a crude approximation of the number of countries in a bull market, where 20% is the (albeit somewhat arbitrary) rule of thumb for whether a stock index is in a bull market.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this indicator you basically want to see it collapse, and then turn up (like now) to signal a major market bottom and subsequent bull market in global equities,\u201d Thomas explained. \u201cThis chart served me well in building conviction on my bullish global equity call in 2016, so it\u2019s something I\u2019m watching closely now.\u201d\n\nLastly, he\u2019s watching the proportion of countries whose main equity benchmarks are positive on a year-on-year basis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much a similar picture to the other two charts, but this one I think is even more interesting given how at its worst point back in January it was only matched by the financial crisis and the Eurozone debt crisis,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cWhat\u2019s also interesting is how it has crossed up through that key threshold \u2014 basically sounding loud and clear a signal that a new bull market is underway.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just these three breadth indicators that are delivering the \u201cclear and classic picture of a new cyclical bull market,\u201d he said, adding that there\u2019s more than the technical case for buying into equities.\n\nThomas said he believes global equities are looking like a bargain, and, relative to bonds, the equity risk premium is attractive. He also pointed out that institutional positioning remains fairly light \u2014 a contrarian bullish signal.\n\n\u201cAnd perhaps most important of all,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe global monetary-policy pivot is clear, material, and reinforces my core view that we see a rebound/re-acceleration in the global economy heading into 2020 (call it a late-cycle extension).\u201d\n\nAt last check in Tuesday\u2019s session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.07% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.08% were slightly higher, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.59% was stuck in the red.", "description": "Stocks just took out new highs, the Federal Reserve continues to pump money into the U.S. economy, equity valuations are looking rather toppy, and there\u2019s an...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU228_bull_ZG_20191029130123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
