They asked the workers three times over the course of a year to rate their levels of self-esteem. The researchers also measured the workers\u2019 levels of narcissism by asking them to rank how much statements such as \u201cI deserve to be seen as a great personality\u201d or \u201cI want my rivals to fail\u201d relate to them.\n\nOne analysis the authors performed showed that self-esteem was indeed correlated with narcissism. But a second type of analysis painted a more nuanced portrait. Self-esteem was associated with one of the two elements of narcissism: narcissistic admiration, or the desire to be loved by others. It was not, however, associated with another element: narcissistic rivalry, or the wish to dominate others.\n\nThe reason for any association between the two traits, the authors suspect, is simply that both people with high self-esteem and people with narcissism tend to evaluate themselves positively. The researchers also found no evidence that higher levels of self-esteem lead to increased narcissism over time. \u201cSelf-esteem and narcissism within the same person do not seem to go hand in hand,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Aleksandra Cichocka, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, told me. \u201cThey seem to be quite separate states.\u201d\n\nRead: The persistent myth of the narcissistic Millennial\n\nOther researchers have reached similar conclusions. Narcissists and people with high self-esteem appear to relate in totally different ways to other people, for example. People who have high self-esteem think of their social relationships as collaborative, while those with narcissism see the world as a zero-sum game. Only one person can be the best, they think, and it must be them.\n\n\u201cSelf-esteem is about being satisfied with yourself as a person and accepting yourself for who you are, regardless of how you compare to others,\u201d said Eddie Brummelman, an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam, who was not involved with the study. \u201cNarcissism is very much about feeling superior to other people.\u201d Though they may seem similar, in this view the two conditions are as different as happiness and sadness.\n\nRead: How to spot a narcissist online\n\nBrummelman has even found that narcissism and self-esteem are the result of two very different approaches to parenting. Both narcissism and self-esteem emerge at about age 7 or 8, he told me. Parents who treat their children like they\u2019re more special and entitled than others might nurture the children\u2019s narcissistic tendencies. Meanwhile, parents who appreciate kids for who they are and emphasize that they don\u2019t have to stand out in order to earn approval are likely to foster high self-esteem. One reason some of those \u201990s-era attempts to build self-esteem might have failed, Brummelman speculates, is that they actually did tell kids they were special. The approach inadvertently caused narcissism, not self-esteem.", "description": "How confident is too confident?", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_1147628687/facebook.jpg?1570748949", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
