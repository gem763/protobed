The ad reflects a grim reality for the network of survivors from the more than 228,000 students who have experienced a school shooting since the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999.\n\n[\u2018Absolutely horrific\u2019: School-shooting-themed sweatshirts slammed by gun violence victims]\n\n\u201cBack to School\u201d debuted on NBC during the Wednesday morning broadcast of the \u201cToday\u201d show alongside an interview with Sandy Hook Promise co-founder Nicole Hockley. Hockley\u2019s 6-year-old son, Dylan, was among the 20 children and six adults who were killed in the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\n\u201cAt the end, the girl with the phone gets me every time,\u201d Hockley said on \u201cToday,\u201d referencing the ad\u2019s final scene, where a young girl huddles in a bathroom stall to text her mom \u201cI love you\u201d as she hides from a gunman.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to turn away from it, so pretending it doesn\u2019t exist is not going to solve it,\u201d Hockley said, explaining the group\u2019s motivation for choosing an ad that even she admits is hard to watch.\n\nThe video is the latest installment of anti-violence PSAs the group releases each year. This year\u2019s ad promotes \u201cKnow the Signs,\u201d a campaign geared at teaching students and school staff how to recognize and intervene when someone shows warning signs of behavior that could lead to shootings or other forms of violence in schools.\n\n[Covered in princesses \u2014 and bulletproof: Inside the booming business of everyday ballistic gear]\n\nThe goal, as Hockley explained, is prevention; she wants people to understand how they can recognize troubling behavior and intervene to stop violence like school shootings before they happen. Other tactics have been more reactive: sales of bulletproof backpacks for kids have grown every year since 2016.\n\n\u201cI will never put a bulletproof backpack on my kid,\u201d Hockley said on \u201cToday.\u201d \u201cI think it sends totally the wrong message: He\u2019s not a soldier going off to war; he\u2019s a boy going off to math class.\u201d\n\nReactions to the campaign on social media were overwhelmingly positive in the hours after the PSA\u2019s debut:\n\nOn a technical level, this is an incredibly well-made PSA with riveting performances. On an emotional level, this is a devastating take on school shootings that ends so disturbingly, I had to text my 20 yr old kid to make sure she was okay. She is... And yet I\u2019m still crying. https://t.co/cN86XiIyqH \u2014 KevinSmith (@ThatKevinSmith) September 18, 2019\n\nThe campaign is expanding beyond print and digital to include radio and outdoor advertising, according to Adweek. The ad is expected to receive a signal boost from $2 million in donated media placements from media organizations such as the AMC theater chain, Cond\u00e9 Nast and CNN, the New York Times reports. Democratic presidential candidates including Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), Andrew Yang, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock have shared the PSA with their Twitter followers.\n\nPrevious spots from the campaign have won advertising awards, with the 2016 PSA \u201cEvan\u201d being viewed more than 11 million times on YouTube.\n\nRead more:\n\nMore than 228,000 students have experienced gun violence at school since Columbine\n\nAfter Newtown shooting, mourning parents enter into the lonely quiet\n\nThe terrible numbers that grow with each mass shooting", "description": "The anti-violence group Sandy Hook Promise released a devastating back-to-school PSA.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e6Juh84DbVUgy0xqN2cRgJy5sGo=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-18-2019/t_7f64bc96b1b84c1f9d0951d7a402b291_name_sandyhook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
