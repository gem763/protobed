I could feel him inside. He was fighting, so I had to fight, too,\u201d she stated.\n\nThankfully, the young mother found Dr. Gayathri Nagaraj, a breast cancer specialist at Loma Linda University Cancer Center who took special care of Devis throughout her pregnancy and chemotherapy sessions until she was ready to give birth this summer.\n\n\u201cGoing through chemotherapy is tough for anyone, and we do our very best to support our patients in every way we can at Loma Linda University Cancer Center,\u201d said Dr. Nagaraj.\n\n\u201cIn Jade\u2019s situation we had to be doubly cautious and alert to ensure the safety of the patient and the baby. I am extremely glad to be working with an amazing team who all came together to make this possible.\u201d\n\nThe young mother said she feels completely happy now that she is able to hold her son, Bradley, in her arms.\n\n\u201cIt is surreal to remember that my pregnancy had an element of extraordinary fear. I am blessed when I look at my son, and I cannot ask for more than that. My baby boy is my miracle child,\u201d she concluded.", "description": "A mother with a rare form of breast cancer gave birth to her baby boy in July after she endured several rounds of chemotherapy.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mom-with-Rare-Breast-cancer-gives-birth-to-son-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
