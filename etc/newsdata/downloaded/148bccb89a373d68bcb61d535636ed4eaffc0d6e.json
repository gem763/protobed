The agreement follows Vox\u2019s acquisition last week of New York Media, the company behind New York magazine and websites including Vulture and the Cut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of other ideas floated\u201d as acquisitions, said Nancy Dubuc, who last year replaced Vice founder Shane Smith as chief executive. She said Refinery29 was the right brand and cultural fit, with a young, mostly female audience that she expects to attract advertisers. \u201cAs other parts of the sector consolidate, I think we have to march in long step.\u201d\n\nVice is pushing for scale as it looks to woo advertisers with larger audiences. It declined to comment on financial terms of the Refinery29 purchase but said the deal would boost its online reach 17% to 350 million unique visitors a month, while diversifying its 60% male audience.\n\nThe acquisition comes as Vice \u2014 along with BuzzFeed, Vox and other digital publishers \u2014 fight for revenue while behemoths Facebook and Google swallow up online advertising spending.\n\nLast year, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti raised the idea of merging digital media companies to better compete with technology giants. He described Vice, Refinery29, Vox Media and Group Nine as companies \u201cdoing interesting work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVice is more diversified than its peers, having reduced its reliance on digital advertising years ago when it expanded into TV through deals with HBO and international broadcasters. It has also built out an in-house advertising agency and pushed into video, selling documentaries and feature films to Netflix and Amazon.\n\nInvestors such as Walt Disney Co. and TPG poured money into the group, with TPG\u2019s 2017 investment valuing it at $5.7 billion.\n\nBut Vice has not been immune to the sector\u2019s woes. The company missed its revenue targets in 2017, and Disney has repeatedly written down the value of its $400-million investment.\n\nDubuc, an experienced television executive, has quickly put her stamp on the company.\n\nIn February she cut about 250 jobs, 10% of Vice\u2019s workforce, and trimmed its stable of websites.\n\nA few months later, Vice raised $250 million in debt, including from billionaire George Soros\u2019 investment fund. The money helped fuel investments in Vice\u2019s faster-growing businesses such as the advertising agency Virtue and Vice Studios, which makes movies and shows to sell to third parties.\n\nThese moves have already borne fruit: Revenue in the second quarter was up 14% from the same quarter last year, according to the company.\n\nAs part of a strategy to make Vice profitable, Dubuc is focusing on international growth. Vice generates half of its revenue and draws 60% of its audience from outside the United States. Dubuc said the company was on track to reach profitability by early 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVice\u2019s relationship with HBO ended recently, but last week it unveiled a new contract to produce documentaries for Showtime. The company says it has more than 110 projects in development worldwide.\n\nRefinery29, founded in 2005 as a guide to New York\u2019s independent fashion shops, has evolved into a wide-ranging online publisher aimed at millennial women. The company\u2019s original co-founders and co-CEOs \u2014 Philippe von Borries and Justin Stefano \u2014 are to stay on and report directly to Dubuc.\n\n\u00a9 The Financial Times Limited 2019.
