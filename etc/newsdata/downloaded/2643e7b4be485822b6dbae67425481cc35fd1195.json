The U.S. has \"called on Turkey to investigate possible violations of international humanitarian law, especially unlawful attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure.\"\n\nThe talking points also note that the department has withdrawn humanitarian and stabilization assistance advisers from northern Syria, which will make it difficult to implement the $50 million aid that the U.S. plans to distribute, per Vox.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has brushed off concerns that ISIS fighters could take advantage of the chaos and escape prisons and detention camps. On Oct. 9, Trump said ISIS fighters would defect to Europe if they escaped.\n\nSo far, at least 950 ISIS supporters have escaped camps for displaced people.\n\nOn Oct. 16, the president said that \"the Kurds are much safer right now. But the Kurds know how to fight, and as I said, they're not angels. They're not angels. ... I wish them all a lot of luck.\"\n\nOf note: The State Department released the talking points before Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and agreed to a temporary ceasefire that would force Kurdish forces to evacuate the area.\n\nA State Department official told Vox the talking points have not been updated since the ceasefire.\n\nGo deeper: Pentagon may struggle to contain ISIS in Syria", "description": "The talking points warn that Turkey's invasion could damage counter-ISIS efforts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/jbAzojHwFVT7599PQvT1QHMhILk=/0x70:4772x2754/1920x1080/2019/10/20/1571597553183.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
