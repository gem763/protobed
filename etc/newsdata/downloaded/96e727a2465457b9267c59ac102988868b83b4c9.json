Investors may be indicating confidence in future economic growth by taking another look at these stocks, as crude oil CLV19, +0.92% price rise along with bond yields TMUBMUSD10Y, +5.34%.\n\n\u201cThe two most beat up sectors in the August pullback (energy and financials) both rebounded hard yesterday, and that\u2019s a potential positive for markets if that cyclical leadership continues,\u201d wrote Tom Essay, president of the Sevens Report, in a Tuesday note.\n\nAnother positive sign for the market is the month-to-date moves in the Value Line Geometric index VALUG, +1.18%, which tracks the roughly 1,700 largest public companies in the world, and is calculated to reflect the performance of the typical company in that grouping, whereas other broad indexes like the S&P 500 can be skewed by price moves in a handful its largest components.\n\nThe Value Line Geometric is up 3.6% in September, versus the S&P 500\u2019s 1.2% gain.\n\nJeff Saut, market strategist with Capital Wealth Partners, argued in an interview with MarketWatch that a second measure of market breadth \u2014 the ratio of the number of individual stocks rising in value compared to those declining in value \u2014 is another positive sign for markets.\n\n\u201cThe advance-decline line is a better measure of the stock market than the indices,\u201d he said, adding that the roughly 3/2 ratio of advancing stocks versus declining stocks this week means \u201cthe break outs [in energy and financials] are real. I think this market is going substantially higher.\u201d\n\nSeveral analysts, however, cautioned investors that this rotation would have to last much longer than two trading days before it triggered a clear change in investor sentiment. Others argued that the action so far this week could be bad news for stocks.\n\nCharlie McElligott, head of cross-asset strategy at Nomura said that Monday\u2019s price action should be viewed through the lens of \u201cmomentum\u201d stocks, or those that have seen the best price gains over the past year, versus \u201cvalue\u201d stocks, or those that are cheapest based on price-to-earnings ratios and other valuation metrics.\n\nHe said that the decline in momentum stocks of 7.7% on Monday was the second-largest one-day move for that group since 1984, pointing out that the S&P 500 typically falls by 4.2% over the next six months following occasions when momentum stocks have sold off as steeply. That said, it has also typically preceded a whopping 27.1% return for value stocks over the same period.\n\n\u201cThe shock of yesterday\u2019s US equities factor reversals will go down in infamy alongside the August 2007 \u2018Quant Quake\u2019 and the Fed/March/April 2016 \u2018Market-Neutral Unwind\u2019 as one of the more stunning trades in modern market history,\u201d McElligot wrote in a Tuesday commentary.\n\nThis would not be the first time during this bull market, however, that analysts cited market internals to call a rotation from fast-growing momentum stocks into inexpensive value stocks, so investors have reason to be cautious.\n\nMichael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading agreed that a rotation into value could be a sign of deteriorating, and not improving, sentiment. \u201cThe riskier areas of the market are deflating,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. \u201cFor the time being, the capital is rotating into value and is not exiting the market yet. That said, the change in the market tenor . . . is something worth close monitoring.\u201d", "description": "September\u2019s stock market gains have been broad based and driven by performance of cyclical sectors, and these trends may be bullish for the overall market", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ980_oilwel_ZG_20190910073545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
