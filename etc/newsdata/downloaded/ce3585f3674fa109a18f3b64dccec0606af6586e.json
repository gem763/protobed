The season kicks off Thursday, and millions of fantasy football fans will be ready. (Steve Luciano/AP)\n\nMichael Serazio, an assistant professor of communication at Boston College, is the author, most recently, of \" The Power of Sports: Media and Spectacle in American Culture .\"\n\n\u201cI believe in rough games and rough, manly sports,\u201d President Teddy Roosevelt once blustered. \u201cI do not feel any particular sympathy for the person who gets battered about a good deal so long as it is not fatal.\u201d\n\nFor Roosevelt, and for many other men through millennia, sports were a hotblooded endeavor. They aestheticized ancestral toil \u2014 in the fields, in the factories \u2014 as competitive ballet.\n\nToday, sports culture has become clinical, wonkish and hyper-rationalized. There\u2019s never been a greater obsession with statistically converting the physical exuberance of athletic activity and venerating those who can do it well.\n\nDaniel Okrent is partly to thank for that.\n\nForty years ago this autumn, Okrent birthed fantasy baseball \u2014 imaginary rosters stitched together from players from around Major League Baseball to compete statistically against others\u2019 imaginary rosters. Okrent says he fantasized about being a general manager rather than the star slugger \u201cbecause I was a [crummy] athlete.\u201d\n\nA few decades hence, some 60 million fellow crummy athletes play fantasy sports, enriching a multibillion-dollar annual market. With the NFL season starting Thursday night, you can find us poring over roster details, mock drafts and statistical arcana.\n\nThe growth has reshaped sports leagues and media and sapped what used to be traditional team loyalties \u2014 that much is obvious. But fantasy has also redefined sports manhood by reflecting changing labor ideals.\n\n[Daily fantasy sports sites say their users aren\u2019t gambling. They\u2019re wrong.]\n\nHistorically, sports have offered parables about how men are supposed to behave, both on and off the field, and therefore within and beyond the workplace. Among scholars, it\u2019s pretty much taken for granted that sports help uphold a toxic masculinity \u2014 that strong, aggressive and rugged male ideal that Roosevelt so fetishized a century ago.\n\nThis is not how famed Oakland A\u2019s GM Billy Beane relates to sport, nor how you or I do as fantasy players, wheeling and dealing in his likeness. Yet Roosevelt\u2019s fetish was as much a product of his time as is ours with fantasy.\n\nFor at the turn of the 20th century, masculinity found itself in similar \u201ccrisis\u201d in American culture: An agrarian age was subsumed by the new industrial world, with different jobs offered and different demands made upon the bodies, livelihoods and, therefore, dignities of men. As machines replaced what had previously been accomplished by beefy dint, fears became widespread \u2014 a perceived atrophy of not just muscles, but the visible index of patriarchal power.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, organized sports emerged and helped assuage anxieties. They offered alleged proof of masculine superiority and a tantalizing space where heroes still modeled \u201cpioneer traits\u201d \u2014 where pure muscle and raw effort foretold survival destiny.\n\nBrawn, however, counts for much less on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in 2019. And fantasy sports offer men similar metaphors of what work should be rewarded.\n\nTake this sexist recent DraftKings ad: \u201cFormer accountant Derek Bradley,\u201d an awestruck narrator announces, as the camera pans over the marble statue of a skinny, pasty fellow, clutching wads of cash and being scaled by tiny women. \u201cFantasy baseball took him from a guy with holes in his underpants to a guy with bikini models in them.\u201d\n\nThis is what \u201cthe end of men\u201d apparently looks like: a postindustrial economy that is, as the Atlantic\u2019s Hanna Rosin puts it, \u201cindifferent\u201d to men\u2019s strength and size, evidenced by the Great Recession\u2019s demolition of explicitly physical trades such as manufacturing and construction.\n\nSports have undergone the same profound digital disruption. Nowadays, data is, in and of itself, a competitive arena for sports participation (not to mention economic primacy, driving tech stocks skyward).\n\nFantasy gets us to think and feel about sports fundamentally differently than traditional fandom \u2014 more in keeping with those hyper-quantified norms. The longer you play, the more you wind up adjusting lineups each Sunday morning with the player\u2019s name and photo invisible to you; it\u2019s merely an equation to be solved, a string of data to be leveraged for competitive advantage. Is that really so different from how the titans of tech look upon us all?\n\n[Sports were already politicized. And sports culture is deeply conservative.]\n\nFantasy schools us in \u201cvicarious management\u201d \u2014 a new mode of fandom consciousness where we identify with ownership regimes rather than disposal player properties. It\u2019s given rise to a post\u00ad-\u201cMoneyball\u201d \u201ccult\u201d of the GM, in which fans idolize a great and powerful Oz behind the scenes, wearing khakis, talking on a cellphone and algorithmically unlocking \u201caha!\u201d insights on spreadsheets.\n\nFranchises have thus been bolstering their scouting staff with analysts, engineers and software developers in the hopes of excavating some statistical advantage unseen by the naked, qualitative eye. Unparalleled amounts of player performance data and biometric information are now subjected to regular regression analysis that wasn\u2019t even conceivable a few years ago: from panoptic basketball \u201csmart courts\u201d to MLB sensory compression sleeves and bat sensors to player DNA sequencing. The front office of the world champion Houston Astros boasted a former NASA bio-mathematician \u2014 not exactly the \u201cdumb jock\u201d stereotype held aloft for decades of sports culture.\n\nIn turn, young skippers who can manage by metrics slowly supplant an obsolete old guard with a disruption-loving lack of sentimentality: \u201cThere will be two kinds of coaches around the world,\u201d predicts one executive at a sports tech firm. \u201cThere are going to be coaches that believe in this kind of analytics and engage with it and there are going to be former coaches.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re not the only American workers being told their operating system is out of date.\n\nFor four decades, fantasy has modeled these labor ideals for us. Billy Beane \u2014 and, for that matter, every Monday morning quarterback swaggering into the office, chest puffed out from his fantasy roster\u2019s weekend domination \u2014 no longer typify Roosevelt\u2019s \u201crough, manly\u201d sportsman ideal. We now celebrate sports in a more bloodless, number-crunching fashion.\n\nIt\u2019s still just play, but fantasy gaming has foreshadowed much about the future of work \u2014 and perhaps manhood as well.", "description": "Labor ideals in sports have changed, along with the labor market in the broader world.", "authors": ["Michael Serazio", "An Assistant Professor Of Communication At Boston College", "Is The Author", "Most Recently", "Of", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/H60K3K67c-O_gPR3M6EWvuFcAh4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QIPI2JDITMI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
