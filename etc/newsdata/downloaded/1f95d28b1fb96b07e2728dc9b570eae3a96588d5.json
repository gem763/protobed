We know exactly what to expect. In fact, we know nearly everything except maybe just how good the cameras are. But there is one thing we don\u2019t know, and it\u2019s the thing we have been asking since the very first Pixel hardware.\n\nIs Google serious about selling hardware now or what?\n\nIt\u2019s a perennial question, one I know the Google hardware division team is getting a little sick of hearing. This is the fifth Pixel phone, after all, counting the Pixel 3A. Google acquired a chunk of HTC to make phones. It got T-Mobile, Sprint, and (presumably) AT&T on board for this release so it could have a nationwide US release on every major carrier instead of just exclusively on Verizon.\n\nCommand Line is The Verge\u2019s daily newsletter about personal tech.

But for every point you\u2019d make, there\u2019s a powerful and often more compelling counterargument.\n\nThe biggest counterpoint is, of course, that Google just hasn\u2019t sold a ton of Pixel phones. This is mysterious to me in part because the formula for selling a lot of Android phones is not mysterious at all, especially if you\u2019re willing to take a loss on your hardware business: market the everloving hell out of them.\n\nThat is what Samsung did. It made flashy commercials, some of which were highly produced Super Bowl ads. It paid to have Ellen DeGeneres use its phone to take a selfie at the Oscars. Five or six years ago, the Galaxy didn\u2019t become the de facto anti-iPhone because it was the very best Android phone \u2014 it was not \u2014 but because it was the most visible Android phone.\n\nGoogle has plenty of Pixel ads, but it hasn\u2019t engaged in a full-on expensive, multiyear media blitz.\n\nWill this year be any different? We\u2019ll see, but I doubt it. Despite the fact that it\u2019s on all four major US carriers, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see the Pixel 4 suddenly grab more marketshare. A recent report claimed Pixel phones only made up 5 percent of Verizon\u2019s sales.\n\nAnother important counterpoint: too many Pixel models have had maddening hardware or software issues. There were screen problems in the Pixel 2 XL. The Pixel 3 and 3 XL continue to have memory management issues to this day. Cameras have lost photos. Bluetooth has been flaky. Microphone quality has been unreliable to the point where Google has had to pay out settlements in class action lawsuits.\n\nThe only reason those issues weren\u2019t apocalyptic for Google\u2019s brand is that there aren\u2019t that many people affected by them. But flagship phones that command flagship prices shouldn\u2019t have the kinds of issues that have plagued some Pixel models.\n\nThen there are the Pixel 4 leaks.\n\nLook, leaks happen to everybody. But part of being a top-tier phone maker is getting more scrutiny and more people trying to find details about your products. Initially, Google looked like it had a savvy strategy. It tweeted out a confirmation that it was working on the Pixel 4 in June. It later added confirmation of Project Soli and face unlock.\n\nI continue to believe those were smart moves. Why pretend like the leaks don\u2019t exist or that your phone is a deep dark secret when it\u2019s really not? The problem wasn\u2019t Google\u2019s tweets. It was everything else.\n\nThe number of and detail within the leaks is an embarrassment for Google\n\nIf you want a sign that Google hasn\u2019t matured as a hardware company, look no further than all OF those leaks. Yes, it\u2019s possible some of the phones out there were straight-up stolen, but everything you could think of has been photographed, put on video, and written about. There\u2019s also a full hands-on with the Pixelbook Go out there.\n\nIt\u2019s amateur hour.\n\nLucky for Google, the embarrassment of the past few months can be wiped away by releasing a really great set of products. There was a certain amount of swagger to Google\u2019s tweets pre-announcing its own products, but as I wrote back in June, they significantly raised the stakes:\n\nMore than anything else, Google needs to stop quietly suggesting that it\u2019s still new at this hardware thing and really ramp it up. After four years, it\u2019s time to start selling in volume, start making phones that are directly competitive with the iPhone on every metric, and stop everybody from wondering if selling hardware is just a side business, just a hobby. This year, it\u2019s go big or go home time for the Pixel.\n\nThat time has arrived. In the intervening months, we\u2019ve seen stellar phones like the OnePlus 7T come in at price points that Google seems unlikely to match. That means the Pixel 4 will need to impress to justify what I expect will be a higher price than many of its Android competitors.\n\nThe Pixel 4 will need to justify a higher price than many of its Android competitors\n\nGoogle has to find a way to reintroduce a phone that we all feel like we already know after all of those leaks. Then it has to find a way to sell more of them. Oh, and it has to make a good, reliable phone.\n\nSo even though you might know a ton about the Pixel 4 already, you don\u2019t know if Google really is going to do what it needs to do to make the Pixel 4 successful. In other words, today\u2019s keynote is a great chance to prove that Google is serious about hardware.\n\nWhat to expect at Google\u2019s event\n\n+ The next Big Tech battleground is your ears\n\nDan Seifert is right about this being one of the reasons Google needs to make its own wireless earbuds, but it still gives me a sad: \u201cTruly wireless earbuds often provide the best experience when they are paired with devices made by the same company.\u201d\n\n+ Google\u2019s 2019 Pixel event: all of the rumors, news, and announcements\n\nHere\u2019s a good place to follow along today once the live blog is over. We\u2019ll post all of our Google stories here.\n\nMore news\n\n+ Next year, new space missions will test technologies to fix busted satellites in orbit\n\nLoren Grush rolls in and makes everybody who thinks they have hard tech problems here on Earth feel bad yet again:\n\nDesigning a spacecraft that can catch up to and dock with a broken satellite is no easy feat. For one thing, these satellites are zooming overhead at thousands of miles per hour, making them difficult to approach. Additionally, practically all of the satellites that have been sent into space weren\u2019t designed to be caught and repaired. They don\u2019t have appendages for spacecraft to latch on to, so satellite servicing vehicles will have to come up with creative ways to grapple a satellite that\u2019s run out of fuel. And if a satellite suffered some kind of catastrophic failure, it\u2019s possible it broke into pieces, making it even harder to grab.\n\n+ Microsoft\u2019s xCloud preview is now live in the US, UK, and Korea\n\nMicrosoft is officially launching its Project xCloud preview today for Xbox users in the US, UK, and Korea. The software giant has started inviting people to participate in the beta, with game streaming limited to Gears 5, Halo 5: Guardians, Killer Instinct, and Sea of Thieves during the initial preview phase.\n\n+ Faraday Future founder files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nYou have to admit that Faraday Future has been incredibly innovative. They\u2019ve made it possible to watch a car wreck for literally years. Sean O\u2019Kane explains the stakes. I don\u2019t see a single thing that could go wrong with this plan. (i.e. it\u2019s not just one thing that will go wrong.)\n\nBefore proceeding in court with Chapter 11, though, Jia is offering to satisfy those debts through a trust backed by the value of his ownership stake in Faraday Future. This trust will only pay out to creditors if and when the startup goes public.\n\n+ Samsung launches Android 10 beta for Galaxy S10 devices\n\nA little over a month ago, I argued that there was no way Google could solve the Android update problem because of issues inherent to the ecosystem. Now here comes Samsung, trying to prove me wrong! It\u2019s still late compared to iOS and still a beta, but it\u2019s a month earlier than Samsung pulled off last year. Maybe Project Treble really worked.\n\n+ OnePlus CEO explains why there\u2019s no 5G version of the 7T Pro\n\nI cannot emphasize this enough: do not buy a 5G phone right now. OnePlus was right not to bother making one this year.\n\n+ Microsoft\u2019s latest Surface Book 2 update fixes its dreaded Nvidia GPU bug\n\nMicrosoft has also had a very bad year for software updates. Glad this is finally fixed.\n\n+ Apple\u2019s iPhone SE 2 will start at $399, Ming-Chi Kuo predicts\n\nThat seems like a very good \u2014 and not very surprising \u2014 price. I know fans of smaller phones are pre-disappointed, and I don\u2019t blame them, er, us. I guess the real question is: do you care more about having a small phone or about having the Apple ecosystem? Because there are modern, smaller Android phones out there.\n\nReviews\n\n+ Dell\u2019s latest XPS 15 has a speedy processor and gorgeous display, but it isn\u2019t a slam dunk\n\n+ Eero\u2019s latest router system is simple to use and less expensive than before", "description": "Google is launching the Pixel 4 today.
