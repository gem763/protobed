The House, Howell wrote, is legally engaged in an impeachment inquiry, despite claims by Trump and Republicans the the investigation is \u201cillegitimate\u201d because the House did not hold a formal vote authorizing it before it began.\n\n\u201cEven in cases of presidential impeachment, a House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn a statement, the House Judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler, cheered the decision.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s thoughtful ruling recognizes that our impeachment inquiry fully comports with the constitution and thoroughly rejects the spurious White House claims to the contrary,\u201d he said. \u201cThis grand jury information that the administration has tried to block the House from seeing will be critical to our work.\u201d\n\nJustice department lawyers argued at a hearing earlier this month that House Democrats already had sufficient evidence from Mueller\u2019s investigation, including copies of summaries of FBI witness interviews.\n\nThe department had also argued that the House panel did not have a sufficient explanation for how the material would help in the committee\u2019s investigations of Trump, and that impeachment is not a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d under the law, for which the information could be disclosed.\n\nThe court ruling comes after reports that the DoJ has opened a criminal inquiry into the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, a move that has raised concern that Trump is using the department to go after his political opponents.\n\nThe news is the latest setback for Trump, who has come under attack on multiple fronts. Over the past month, a parade of witnesses have defied White House efforts to stonewall the House impeachment inquiry, delivering remarkable testimony in the expanding investigation involving Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukraine president for a political favor.\n\nCongressional impeachment investigators issued subpoenas Friday to three more Trump administration officials, demanding that they testify in the probe .\n\nThe chairs of the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry subpoenaed two officials of the White House Office of Management and Budget: acting director Russell Vought and Michael Duffey, who oversees national security programs. They also subpoenaed state department counselor T Ulrich Brechbuhl.\n\nInvestigators asked all three earlier this month to testify, but none have appeared.\n\nThe Trump administration has refused to make its officials available for depositions in the investigation and resisted supplying documents as well. But witnesses have been appearing anyway after they are issued subpoenas, including key witnesses Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nTrump impeachment catch-up: where we are now Read more\n\n\u201cThe committees therefore have no choice but to issue a subpoena compelling your mandatory appearance,\u201d the letters read.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, sparked by a whistleblower complaint, centers on Trump\u2019s efforts to extract a commitment from Ukraine\u2019s new president to investigate former vice-president and 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nInvestigators want to know why nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine was delayed, even though it was approved by Congress and signed into law by Trump. Others have testified that Trump was demanding investigations of Democrats in exchange for the aid and for an Oval Office meeting coveted by Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, is also reportedly in talks to sit for a deposition with the House committees investigating impeachment.\n\nBolton, who abruptly left the administration amid sharp foreign policy disagreements with the president and members of his cabinet, reportedly likened the effort to influence Ukraine in return for domestic political favors to a \u201cdrug deal\u201d.\n\nTrump announced Bolton\u2019s departure in a tweet, and the former official has since been publicly critical of the president\u2019s foreign policy.", "description": "Democrats must be given access to secret grand jury testimony, judge rules, while House committees subpoena Trump officials who refused to testify", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d2f77bf7a7fb3fab9d7175c506bc67f921e251a/0_197_5908_3545/master/5908.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2cfe0c3f59ae162252253567986b361e", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
