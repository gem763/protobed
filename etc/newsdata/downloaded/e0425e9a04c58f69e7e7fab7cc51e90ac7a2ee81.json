He also ordered the armed forces to restore order nationwide, blaming unrest on extremists he said had infiltrated protests.\n\nConaie - an umbrella organization of indigenous groups across Ecuador - stopped short of calling off talks and said its members would continue to protest.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real dialogue without necessary guarantees\u201d of physical safety, Conaie said on Twitter.\n\nIn a late-night speech to the nation, Moreno defended the curfew and thanked indigenous leaders for being open to dialogue and said together they would look at the impact of a law he passed last week that ended a decades-old fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWhoever has the disposition to talk, we\u2019ll do it. This process has made advances and I hope to give you good news soon,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did not indicate any plans to repeal the law, which has triggered a backlash and protests that have spun out of control.\n\nOn Saturday, the tenth day of marches scheduled in Quito, police and protesters clashed amid clouds of tear gas as vandals set fire to the comptroller\u2019s office and a TV station.\n\nRoads to Quito\u2019s airport were blocked and flights cancelled.\n\nLocal media reported violent protests in other parts of the country, including the coastal city of Guayaquil, where Moreno has moved his government for safety reasons.\n\nThe United Nations in Ecuador, which has offered to mediate talks to end the unrest, announced late on Saturday that a first round of dialogue with indigenous groups would be held in Quito on Sunday at 3 p.m. local time (2000 GMT). It did not say if Moreno and Conaie would take part.\n\nA demonstrator wearing an Anonymous mask takes part in a protest against Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno's austerity measures, in Quito, Ecuador October 12, 2019.

More than a 1,100 people have been arrested.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nIt was unclear what impact the curfew had after it went into effect at 3pm (20:00pm GMT) on Saturday. In his late-night message, Moreno said it had yielded \u201ctangible\u201d results.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recovered calm in a good part of the city,\u201d Moreno told Ecuadoreans.\n\nShuttered inside for several hours, many residents of the city of more than 2 million people banged on pots at night on their roofs in a collective call for peace.", "description": "An indigenous group in Ecuador behind mass protests against cuts to fuel subsidies agreed to hold talks with President Lenin Moreno, who ordered a curfew in the capital on Saturday after the latest wave of violence in the city.", "authors": ["Alexandra Valencia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440350667&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0D0", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
