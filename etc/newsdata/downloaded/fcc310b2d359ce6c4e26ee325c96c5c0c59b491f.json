Chicken Producers Soar as China Signals End of U.S. Ban\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Shares of America chicken processors surged Monday after China said it\u2019s prepared to lift a ban on U.S. poultry that\u2019s been in place since 2015.\n\nTyson Foods Inc (NYSE: )., Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp. and Sanderson Farms Inc. are all poised to benefit as China may seek to import more protein in the wake of a deadly pig disease that\u2019s wiped out a significant percentage of its hog herd. Chicken is the cheapest substitute for pork, which is the country\u2019s preferred protein.\n\n\u201cThis could be a significant positive for the U.S. chicken industry given China\u2019s historical prominence as a chicken import partner, and because of the country\u2019s current need for additional protein imports in the wake of African swine fever-driven supply challenges,\u201d analysts at Stephens Inc., including Ben Bienvenu, said in a note Monday.\n\nSanderson Farms shares gained as much as 16%, the biggest intraday jump in more than a decade, while Pilgrim\u2019s Pride and Tyson rose as much as 8.3% and 5.1%, respectively.\n\nAfrican swine fever is spreading through Asia and may cut Chinese production by 60% by the end of this year, according to researcher Global AgriTrends. China produces and consumes about half of the world\u2019s pork, and the damage from the fever is widely expected to create a protein gap that suppliers won\u2019t be able to fill. Pork costs have skyrocketed in the country.\n\nChina is already importing more chicken from Brazil, the U.S.\u2019s main competitor in poultry exports, including parts and whole chickens, Sanderson Farms Chief Executive Officer Joe Sanderson said Oct. 18 during an investor presentation.\n\nIn the event of access to China, the quantity of U.S. exports may not necessarily see significant increases, according to Global AgriTrends President Brett Stuart. China may just displace exports to smaller markets, which would push up prices, especially for chicken leg quarters.\n\n\u201cTo see that leg quarter price get another bump, that would go right to the bottom line of U.S. producers,\u201d Stuart said, which would be \u201cgreat news\u201d for the industry.\n\nSanderson has \u201cthe most quantifiable benefit,\u201d according to the Stephens report, as it sold 74.9 million pounds (34,000 metric tons) of chicken for $62.1 million to China in fiscal year 2014, before the ban.\n\nRising American poultry shipments can help ease a U.S. protein glut. In the first nine months of 2019, U.S. chicken slaughter climbed 1.4% from a year earlier and animal weights also increased.\n\n(Adds context in paragraph five and analyst, company comments in paragraph six.)", "description": "Chicken Producers Soar as China Signals End of U.S. Ban", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED2N1U2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
