She also created the series and is serving as an executive producer alongside Greg Berlanti.\n\n\"I found this book two and a half years ago, and I wanted to make it, and I thought the material was great,\" Cuoco said, explaining why she decided to work hard to bring the show to life. \"I had an instinct about it.\"\n\n\"I [also] think it's really important to start putting our own stamps on things, especially as women, and having our own voice,\" she added. \"And I like being the boss. That's it. That's the bottom line.\"\n\nCuoco explained that she'll be leaving for New York in a few weeks to shoot the series, and that she'll be living there until April. It'll be a big change for the actress, the most challenging part being having to say goodbye to her beloved puppies.\n\n\"I've been crying already, knowing that I'm leaving them,\" Cuoco shared. She explained that her husband, Karl Cook, would be caring for their animals -- including their horses and dogs, but that it'll still be hard for her emotionally. \"I'm gonna be the one that needs the help! I'm gonna have to Facetime them every single night.\"\n\n\"My husband and I, we don't feel fulfilled unless were surrounded by all the animals,\" Cuoco shared. \"We fulfill each other, but we really like the animals\u2026 it's who we are.\"\n\nWhich is one reason she's such a proud supporter of Much Love Animal Rescue and their annual Spoken Woof fundraiser celebration.\n\n\"I just love it! I look forward to it every year,\" Cuoco gushed, later adding that she will likely be adopting and taking home a new pup by the end of the evening.\n\nFor more from Cuoco, check out the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nKaley Cuoco Reveals She Still Doesn't Live With Husband Karl Cook\n\nKaley Cuoco Returns to TV to Produce Comedy About a Woman Dreaming of Becoming the Next Oprah Winfrey\n\nKaley Cuoco & Karl Cook Mark 1-Year Wedding Anniversary with Taco Bell, Wine & Hilarious Post\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "The actress opened up to ET on Thursday about her upcoming TV show and her love of animals.", "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/noVrx3apW4b.8nIovvQc8Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/fae0096c236680d19e0bcd977b14c0a8", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
