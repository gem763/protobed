And it ensures that consumers aren\u2019t steered into the traditional \u201cfee-for-service\u201d program over Medicare Advantage.\n\nDemocrats slammed the campaign-style push, noting Mr. Trump\u2019s own budget proposals would curtail spending on Medicare.\n\nMr. Trump mainly used his speech to contrast his broader approach with Democratic plans to expand coverage through ideas such as government-run \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which his administration views as a \u201csocialist\u201d push to upend health plans that millions of people know and enjoy.\n\n\u201cThese people on the other side, these people are crazy, by the way. They want to take it away, give you lousy healthcare,\u201d Mr. Trump said in freewheeling remarks that touched on Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, the 2020 Democratic primary and \u201copen borders.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump tried to find common ground with the senior crowd, saying retirement looks pretty good.\n\n\u201cI should be in this audience, clapping,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t trust anybody to be standing here [at the podium], because I know what you have.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump swept into office pledging to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a health plan that offered \u201cinsurance for everybody,\u201d though his GOP allies were unable to send a bill to his desk in 2017.\n\nThe president settled for incremental changes. He expanded access to cheaper, bare-bones coverage and pushing Congress to zero out the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d penalty for shirking insurance as part of congressional Republicans\u2019 broad tax overhaul.\n\nMr. Trump says he would like to take another run at replacing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, though he is punting major decisions and votes until after the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cIf the Republicans take back the House, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, we\u2019re going to have a fantastic plan,\u201d he said.\n\nThe administration has shifted its rhetoric away from Obamacare in recent months, favoring Mr. Trump\u2019s push to tackle \u201csurprise\u201d medical billing, speed the approval of generic drugs and explore ways to safely import cheaper drugs from Canada.\n\nMr. Trump said he\u2019s being so bold that health care lobbyists might be behind the Democrats\u2019 impeachment bid.\n\n\u201cI would be very surprised if the hoax didn\u2019t come a little bit from the people that we\u2019re taking on,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was from some of these industries that we take on, like pharma.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are working with Mr. Trump on some of his health care efforts but say bigger action is needed.\n\nLiberals pushing a single-payer system say their model will enhance the Medicare program for seniors while extending government-sponsored care to Americans of all ages, as millions continue to go uninsured or struggle with medical debt.\n\n\u201cEvery single Medicare for All and public option proposal put forward by members of Congress would provide more Americans more health care \u2014 increasing the number of people with coverage, lowering out-of-pocket costs, and expanding benefits,\u201d said Maura Calsyn, managing director of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.\n\nBut Trump officials argue government-run programs would restrict choice, rob millions of people of private insurance and weaken a program that\u2019s working for seniors.\n\nSeema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, dubbed Mr. Trump \u201cthe great protector\u201d of Medicare. She said proposals such as Medicare for All or a public option to compete with private plans are immoral and would \u201cdemote American seniors to little better than second-class status.\u201d\n\nSensing the risky politics of single-payer, candidates such as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden are running on plans to patch up Obamacare and enhance it.\n\nMr. Trump is seizing on any vulnerability he can, however, pointing to some Democrats\u2019 push to subsidize health coverage for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\u201cThey put them way ahead of American citizens like you, who obey our laws,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Floridians.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
