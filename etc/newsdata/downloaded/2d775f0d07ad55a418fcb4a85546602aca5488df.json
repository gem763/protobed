Drawn to the lives of the Crawley family and their staff and Lord Fellowes\u2019 commitment to accurately depicting life in a British estate in the early 20th century, the \u201cDowntown Abbey\u201d TV series was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. In the U.S., more advance tickets sold for \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d on Fandango the day they went on sale than any other drama this year. The movie opens widely on Friday.\n\nIf \u201cDownton\u201d fans turn out in force, Lord Fellowes says, there may be another film. But he also has felt fans\u2019 ire. Some are still sour about deaths in the family. Lord Fellowes says when the actors who portrayed them decided to leave the show, death was the only believable exit.\n\n\u201cFamily who are leaving must die because there\u2019s nothing else for them,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no other reason why you never see them again.\u201d\n\nWe asked Lord Fellowes about the servants and family members who made it to the movie. Here are edited excerpts:\n\nIn what ways did you think it was essential for \u201cDowntown Abbey\u201d to be accurate?\n\nI think if you try to get all the details right and you talk to enough people who remember that life\u2014which there were when I was much younger\u2014you can imbue it with a kind of reality that seems believable to people who maybe don\u2019t know about that way of life and certainly may not approve of it, but when they watch it, they can see how it worked. They can understand how people lived like that. Whereas when you start to get all the details wrong, it doesn\u2019t feel believable. It doesn\u2019t feel truthful.\n\nThe cast of the \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 film includes, from left, Elizabeth McGovern, Harry Hadden-Paton, Laura Carmichael, Hugh Bonneville and Michael Fox.

I think \u201cThe Crown\u201d has been successful because they have chosen one of the only people on Earth to whom major events are constantly happening. But most people don\u2019t have lives like that. They have periods of industry, periods of activity, and then lulls, periods when practically nothing happens, and you can\u2019t afford that in a drama.\n\nCast members of the \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 movie include, from left, Lesley Nicol, Sophie McShera, Jim Carter and Phyllis Logan. Photo: Jaap Buitendijk/Focus Features\n\nThe \u201cDownton\u201d TV show received criticism for softening the experience of the downstairs staff and that life for them was tougher than portrayed. Is that fair?\n\nNot really. I think that is a modern kind of fixation that everyone downstairs was having a horrible time and everyone was terribly rude to their servants and they all suffered and were having a ghastly time. When I made \u201cGosford Park,\u201d I had as advisers three ex-servants. All of them had enjoyed their time in service. And they all had funny stories, some of which I pitched for the movie.\n\nIt\u2019s a way of life that\u2019s gone and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad state that it\u2019s gone. But realistically it must\u2019ve been livable on a level by pretty well everyone involved or it wouldn\u2019t have gone on for a thousand years.\n\nAre you celebrating an era and its values or documenting an age?\n\nI think it\u2019s more a question of documenting it. I mean there were some aspects of that era that seem quite luxurious in these days of political turbulence that we are living through. And there is a kind of order to the way they lived their lives\u2014as they changed their clothes for dinner, and did the same things again and again. But I wouldn\u2019t really go further than that. I don\u2019t celebrate the injustices in society, the difficulty of social mobility, or the control of the upper classes before the First World War.\n\nHistorical accuracy was essential in \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019 Lord Fellowes said, because \u2018when you start to get all the details wrong, it doesn\u2019t feel believable.\u2019 Photo: Brad Trent for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Brief Bio Name: Julian Fellowes\n\nJulian Fellowes What He Does: Screenwriter, actor\n\nScreenwriter, actor How He Got Here: Lord Fellowes created the TV series, \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d which ran for six seasons.
