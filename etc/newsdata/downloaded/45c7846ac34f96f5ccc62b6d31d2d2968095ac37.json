Chhitwal-Varma points out, it\u2019s particularly perfect for getting on the table on Diwali night, when the days may not leave much room for more involved dishes. Just be sure to save some room for sweets!\n\nPaneer Makhani Recipe\n\nBy Puneeta Chhitwal-Varma\n\nA warming, comforting meal in many South Asian homes, Paneer Makhani is a mellow dish, and vegetarian too, that satisfies the soul!\n\n*Instead of making your own spice blend, you could use a store-bought garam masala or a butter chicken masala blend. Use a little less if you do that, and taste as you go along until you're sure of the flavours. Every spice blend is unique.\n\nIngredients\n\nGround spice blend:*\n\n1 tsp whole coriander seeds\n\n\u00bd tsp whole cumin seeds\n\n\u2153 tsp black peppercorn seeds\n\n2 cloves\n\n1 black cardamom\n\n2 dried red chilies (optional)\n\nMakhani sauce:\n\n1 cup roughly chopped tomatoes (approximately 3 medium-sized tomatoes)\n\n\u00bd cup roughly chopped onions (I prefer red or purple here)\n\n1 green chilies (stems removed)\n\n3 garlic cloves\n\n1-inch piece of ginger\n\n1 green cardamom pod, husks removed, seeds only\n\nSalt to taste\n\nPaneer:\n\n1 tsp ghee\n\n1 bay leaf\n\n1 small cinnamon stick\n\n\u00bd tsp turmeric\n\n\u00bd tsp Kashmiri red chili powder, or paprika\n\nSalt to taste\n\n400 g paneer, cut into bite-sized cubes\n\n1 tsp ground spice blend (prepared in first step)\n\n1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves\n\nPat of butter, plus more for serving (optional)\n\n1 tbsp cream (optional)\n\nPreparation\n\nGround spice blend:\n\nRoast all of the spices for a few minutes in a dry, hot pan. Grind the spices in a spice grinder (you could also use a coffee grinder but you will not be able to use it for coffee again as the aroma will remain); alternatively, you can use a mortar and pestle. Set ground spices aside.\n\nMakhani sauce:\n\n(Using a pan that has a lid with a steam hole, or prop the lid up with a wooden spoon and leave a small gap.) Add all of the ingredients for the sauce to a pan and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Blend the sauce to a velvety smooth texture using an immersion blender. If the texture is not smooth enough, strain the sauce before using it.\n\nPaneer:\n\nAdd the ghee to the pan and heat. Add the bay leaf and cinnamon stick and let them sputter in the ghee. Add the turmeric, chili powder and sprinkle some salt in the pan and stir to mix.\n\nAdd the paneer to the pan and toss it in the spices. Cook for one minute. Pour in the blended makhani sauce and coat the paneer (note, there will be some sputtering so take care). Simmer for one minute. Add the spice blend and one cup of water, then simmer for 5 minutes.\n\nRub the dry fenugreek leaves in your palm to release the flavour and add to the pan. Add the butter. Stir and simmer for another minute. Add that cream and stir in to mellow the flavour.\n\nServe with a swirl of melted butter and a sprinkle of the remaining spice blend, alongside naan or roti. You can also serve with rice if you like.\n\nYield: Makes 4-5 servings.\n\nPuneeta Chhitwal-Varma is a blogger and better food advocate behind Maple and Marigold.
