I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react. #Brexit \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 19, 2019\n\nJOHNSON PLAN TIPPED ON HEAD\n\nJohnson had hoped that Saturday would see recalcitrant lawmakers finally back the divorce deal he agreed with EU leaders this week and end three years of political deadlock since the 2016 referendum vote to leave the bloc.\n\nInstead, lawmakers voted 322 to 306 in favour of an amendment that turned Johnson\u2019s planned finale on its head by obliging him to ask the EU for a delay, and increasing the opportunity for opponents to frustrate Brexit.\n\nJohnson has previously promised that he would take the country out of the bloc on Oct. 31, without explaining how he would do this while also complying with the Benn Act.\n\n\u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so,\u201d he told parliament after lawmakers backed the amendment on Saturday.\n\nOpposition politicians accused him of believing he was above the law.\n\n\u201cJohnson is a Prime Minister who is now treating Parliament and the Courts with contempt,\u201d John McDonnell, the opposition Labour Party\u2019s finance spokesman said.\n\n\u201cHis juvenile refusal to even sign the letter confirms what we always suspected that Johnson with his arrogant sense of entitlement considers he is above the law and above accountability.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s highest court is due to consider on Monday a legal challenge that had sought to force Johnson to comply with the Benn Act. The court said earlier this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson promised #Scottish court he would comply with #BennAct & not seek to frustrate it. Looks like he\u2019s breaking both promises,\u201d Joanna Cherry, a Scottish National Party lawmaker involved in the case said on Twitter.\n\nThis is pathetic. NB @BorisJohnson promised #Scottish court he would comply with #BennAct & not seek to frustrate it. Looks like he\u2019s breaking both promises. Fortunately no need to raise new proceedings our existing case is back in court on Monday #Brexit https://t.co/O8Bsy5qfFD \u2014 Joanna Cherry QC MP (@joannaccherry) October 19, 2019", "description": "He also sent a contradictory note -- this one signed -- to the EU president arguing against a Brexit extension.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dac18e2200000401850633c.jpeg?cache=2zdghxmkdk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
