All three remain in police custody.\n\nThe fully functioning toilet is a piece of art made entirely from 18-karat gold that was installed in Blenheim Palace, England as part of an exhibition by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.\n\nPolice have been investigating its theft since it was stolen on September 14 and previously made two arrests.\n\nA 66-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary before being released on bail, and a 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and was released under investigation.\n\nThe fully functioning solid gold toilet, made by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was stolen on September 14.

So no, I don't plan to be guarding it.\"", "description": "Police investigating the theft of a solid gold toilet from a stately home in the UK made three arrests Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jack Guy"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190914090535-solid-gold-toilet-stolen-winston-churchill-birthplace-ndwknd-vpx-00000716-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
