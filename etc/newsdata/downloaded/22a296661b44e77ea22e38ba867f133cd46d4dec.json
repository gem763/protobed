Adam Schiff (pictured) kicked him out because he's not on the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs or Oversight Committees. Gaetz is a member of the Judiciary Committee\n\nThe Trump administration's removal in May of Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine could figure in Hill's testimony.\n\nOn Friday, Yovanovitch testified that she had been removed based on 'unfounded and false claims' after coming under attack by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who had been working to get Ukraine to investigate Trump's political rival, Joe Biden.\n\nGaetz often comes to Trump's defense and even has a quote from the president praising him included in his personal Twitter account bio.\n\n'He's a machine...handsome and going places,' Gaetz quotes Trump in the blurb.\n\nLast week, he attempted to discredit the impeachment inquiry by invoking Trump's rhetoric when he called the Democratic hearings a 'kangaroo court.'\n\nHe was also lambasted on social media for the reference because he called Schiff 'Captain Kangaroo,' which is the title of an old children's TV show that has no links to the term 'kangaroo court,' which is often used to identify a corrupt court room.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former vice president Biden, a top contender for the Democratic nomination to face him in the 2020 presidential election, and Biden's businessman son Hunter Biden.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to dig up dirt on a domestic rival after withholding $391 million in U.S. security aid intended to help combat Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of Ukraine.\n\nFiona Hill was escorted to a committee room where she testified behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee Monday\n\nHead to head: Democrat Adam Schiff chairs the House Intel Committee and has become a focus of Donald Trump's ire as he leads part of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry\n\nHill, who left her post during the summer, had advocated a tough U.S. approach on Moscow.\n\nLawmakers this week are returning from a two-week recess, with testimony from current and former administration officials on the schedule. The headline event could be testimony on Thursday from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nSondland, a political appointee and Trump political donor rather than a career diplomat, participated in a text message exchange with Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine. Democrats say it reveals concern among aides that Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden was improper.\n\nZelensky agreed to investigate, and Trump eventually allowed the aid.\n\nSondland is expected to be asked why he relayed from Trump to other diplomats that the president said no 'quid pro quos' connecting the Biden investigation with the U.S. aid.\n\nQuid pro quo is a Latin term meaning a favor for a favor and is used to exhibit an exchange of good or services contingent upon completion of the other.\n\nIn this case, Democrats are insisting Trump set an illegal quid pro quo when he withheld military aid just days before his call where he urged Zelesnky to probe the Bidens.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing \u2013 still the inquiry could prompt the House to approve formal articles of impeachment charges, which would lead to a trial in the Senate that would either clear the president or remove him from office.\n\nThe Senate is led by Trump's fellow Republicans, who have shown little inclination to remove him.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee also is scheduled to hear from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent and State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, a top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nAs talks continue over whether the whistleblower from within the U.S. intelligence community who prompted the inquiry will testify, Trump weighed in on Twitter, demanding that the person testify and that their identity be revealed.\n\nScathing statement: Marie Yovanovitch, who Trump fired as ambassador to Ukraine in May, told lawmakers she was pushed out because of a whispering campaign against her\n\nCenter of the affair: Hunter Biden will break his silence on Tuesday by speaking to ABC's Good Morning America, the first time he has been seen and heard from since July\n\nTrump has questioned the patriotism of the whistleblower, who filed a complaint after the Zelensky call saying Trump was improperly using the power of his office to solicit interference in the 2020 election from a foreign country.\n\nLawmakers also may debate whether to seek to compel testimony from Giuliani. On Thursday, two Giuliani associates - Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman - who helped him with his efforts to investigate the Bidens, were charged with scheming to violate U.S. campaign finance laws.\n\nGiuliani has defended his actions as proper in his role as Trump's lawyer.\n\nA source familiar with the probe said federal investigators, including Manhattan prosecutors, are 'examining Giuliani's interactions' with Parnas and Furman.\n\nGiuliani disputed that, saying he would have expected to have heard from prosecutors.\n\n'I think the probe is a malicious rumor,' Giuliani told Reuters.\n\nGiuliani already has a subpoena from the Intelligence Committee demanding that he produce documents related to Ukraine by Tuesday. He has not said whether he will comply.", "description": "Fiona Hill quit as Trump's adviser on Russia and Ukraine this summer and testified behind closed doors to Adam Schiff's House Intelligence Committee about the unfolding scandal.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/19/19705906-0-image-a-4_1571079227407.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
