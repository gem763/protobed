It wasn't the first time", "language": "en", "text": "That I crossed paths with Harvey Weinstein at a standup show last Wednesday to me is some kind of cosmic wonder, because this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve responded to him with comedy \u2013 although it was the first time he was in the room.\n\nWhen the news broke in 2017 about rape accusations against him, it was difficult to find a comedy show where I didn\u2019t hear a bad rape joke, usually coming from a male comedian who was punching down on accusers with unoriginal and offensive jabs.\n\nI never thought it was time to ban comics from talking about rape, but it did seem like time for a new kind of rape joke, from new voices. I remember thinking: if rape survivors make up at least 20% of women in America and a significant number of men, why don\u2019t they have the mic right now?\n\nWarning: the below video contains strong language\n\nThe first time I heard a comic talking about her sexual assault, at a bar show in Brooklyn, it felt like a religious experience. It was so refreshing and cathartic that I found myself desperately searching to find a space exclusively for this \u201cgenre\u201d of joke somewhere in New York. I wanted to capture it, to share this story as a film-maker, but I couldn\u2019t find a standup show anywhere. There was this obvious hole where there needed to be a show, and so I decided to fill that.\n\nMy show was Rape Jokes by Survivors.\n\nEvery woman knows another woman who has a \u201cme too\u201d story, so I started by reaching out to a comic who I know publicly identifies as a survivor of rape. She knew of two more women. Those women knew of three more women. Overnight, I had a list of over 50 comics, and I could see the strength in their numbers.\n\nWatching these comics perform made me realize there was something healing to the process of making a funny joke about your own rape. For a joke to be funny, it has to be tested. It can bomb. And when you\u2019re writing a joke about what might be the worst night of your life, that bomb is no easy rejection to swallow. I discovered that in order for these jokes to be funny, the comedians in many cases had to first and foremost process their traumatic experiences. If an audience senses that a comedian is not \u201cOK\u201d with what they\u2019re talking about, the audience often tenses up and feels sympathy rather than the release of laughter.\n\nOn the night of Rape Jokes by Survivors, I was shocked to see the show sold out 150 tickets, with a line of people on standby out the door. Still, as the show began, there was a bit of tension. You could feel that some of the audience members were holding back.\n\nI brought out a heavy hitter early on, trusting that she would bring up the energy of the room \u2013 and Wendi Starling did not disappoint. She called out the audience on their own hesitance and demanded their laughter, stating that the comics needed laughter to heal. \u201cWhen you withhold your laughter from me, it feels like you\u2019re taking your pain, and forcing it inside of my body!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Rape Jokes by Survivors comedy show.

There was Irene Fagan Merrow smiling ear to ear while she roasted her rapist for having a sad blog and describing all of the \u201cperks\u201d of being raped. Rebecca O\u2019Neal telling us about how Prozac was gentrifying her brain. Adrienne Truscott closed the show by singing her own version of Whistle by Flo Rida, with a rape whistle between her legs. Their hilarity was a fearless reclaiming of the rape joke, and the crowd couldn\u2019t get enough of it.\n\nOn stage and off, there was a unique sense of sisterhood that I haven\u2019t seen often in comedy. In a green room that might normally be packed with men, there were women survivors laughing, sharing stories from their worst nights of survivorship, drinking wine and hugging one another.\n\n'I had to say something': the comedian who confronted Harvey Weinstein Read more\n\nYou could feel that community in the audience, too, as many people in the room were survivors themselves. One woman approached me after the show and said that she and her friends had driven up from Baltimore. She said that she laughed at stories she didn\u2019t know she was ready to laugh at, and described to me how important that was for her. I heard the same sense of eager excitement and healing that I knew myself.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to feel defined by trauma, especially when it becomes public knowledge. As comedians, we often make a choice to be more defined by how we respond to the pain in our lives. I set out to tell the stories of these women. When I saw them on stage, like so many others, I saw myself too. They are my heroes.", "description": "Kelly Bachman called out the producer while he watched.
