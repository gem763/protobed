Aid workers said they had been told to leave by their organisations, and most had done so reluctantly.\n\nAid agencies, military leaders and senior international officials have warned that hundreds of thousands of people are in immediate danger from Turkey\u2019s newly announced offensive targeting Kurdish forces in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of civilians in northern Syria are now in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. \u201cCivilians and civilian infrastructure must not be a target.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces warned of an \u201cimminent humanitarian catastrophe\u201d as Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, both appealed to Turkey to avoid adding to the instability in Syria.\n\nSyria is already hosting one of the world\u2019s most complex humanitarian crises, with millions of people displaced both within and outside its borders, and the Turkish offensive, announced on Tuesday, threatens to add a frightening new dimension.\n\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of civilians in northern Syria are now in harm\u2019s way. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must not be a target,\u201d said the UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi.\n\nUNHCR called on parties to adhere to international humanitarian law, including providing access for aid agencies.\n\nThe agency said hundreds of thousands of civilians \u201cin northern Syria are now in harm\u2019s way. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must not be a target\u201d.\n\nIn sharp-edged remarks aimed at Turkey, Juncker pointed out that the EU is contributing \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.4bn) to Turkey to help support the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in the country, adding that Europe would not contribute to the creation of a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cI call on Turkey, as well as on the other actors, to act with restraint and to stop operations already, as we are speaking, underway,\u201d said Juncker.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Turkey has security concerns on its border with Syria, Juncker said: \u201cIf the Turkish plan involves the creation of a so-called safe zone, don\u2019t expect the European Union to pay for any of it.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg told a news conference in Rome that while Turkey, a Nato ally, \u201chas legitimate security concerns, \u2026 it is important to avoid actions that may further destabilise the region, escalate tensions and cause more human suffering\u201d.\n\nAid agencies said many of those in the area where the controversial offensive is focused have already survived the brutality of the Islamic State era. Many have been displaced multiple times during Syria\u2019s long war.\n\nAmong those raising concern was the International Rescue Committee, which warned: \u201cAs [the] Turkish offensive in Syria begins, the IRC is deeply concerned about the lives and livelihoods of the 2 million civilians in north-east Syria who have already survived Isis brutality and multiple displacements.\n\n\u201cA military offensive could displace 300,000 people and disrupt life-saving humanitarian services, including the IRC\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International also cautioned against indiscriminate attacks that could result in civilian casualties.\n\n\u201cBoth Turkish and Kurdish forces have a track record of carrying out indiscriminate attacks in Syria that have killed scores of civilians,\u201d said Lynn Maalouf, Middle East research director for the group. \u201cThis must not be allowed to happen again.\n\n\u201cThe international community must take measures to ensure respect for international humanitarian law by the Turkish authorities and pro-Turkey armed groups and Kurdish forces, if yet another humanitarian catastrophe in northern Syria is to be avoided\n\n\u201cAs in other parts of Syria, scores of civilians in north-east Syria have already suffered from the impact of successive military offensives, multiple displacements and dire living conditions.\n\n\u201cTurkey has an obligation under international humanitarian law to take all possible measures to protect civilians and to ensure they have access to humanitarian aid. Civilians wishing to flee the fighting must be given safe passage to do so.\u201d\n\nThe UK-based agency Save the Children also issued a warning ahead of the start of the offensive.\n\nWhat is the situation in north-eastern Syria? Read more\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned for the hundreds of thousands of people present in north-east Syria, and we urge all military parties on the ground to ensure that operations do not impact civilians who could face widespread displacement or have their movements restricted.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there are 1.65 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in this area, including more than 650,000 displaced by war. All essential services including food, water, shelter, health, education and protection must be consistently provided to all civilians, or we could see another humanitarian disaster unfold before our eyes.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the Syrian civilians in the north-east, there are thousands of women and children living in camps across the area \u2026 who rely completely and exclusively on humanitarian aid. Any interruption to camp services which are already overstretched would put their lives at risk.\n\n\u201cChildren in Syria who have fled Isis-held areas are innocent and swept up in horrific events far beyond their control. Their short lives have been full of violence and fear. All children deserve [the] chance to recover.\u201d", "description": "Aid workers also join exodus amid warnings that campaign against Kurdish forces will put hundreds of thousands of lives at risk", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont", "Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8c35e512b7e821bc5d782bc073b622b339541c7/0_49_3367_2020/master/3367.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a3437df71e2635131140c93b7ed8a7bf", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
