The agency also said people should stop buying vaporizers, cartridges and liquids off the street or modifying vaping products bought legally.\n\nIndiana\u2019s health department said it had confirmed the death of a state resident \u201colder than 18 years\u201d with the illness on Thursday. Minnesota also reported a death. Its health department said an elderly person, who had a history of lung disease, was hospitalized with a severe lung injury associated with vaping an illegal marijuana-related product and died last month after developing other conditions.\n\nAlso Friday, Los Angeles County health officials said they were investigating a death in the county that was associated with vaping. The CDC has yet to confirm this death.\n\nThe latest reports follow the deaths of individuals in Illinois and Oregon after using a vaping device.\n\nThe cause of the illnesses is a mystery, though health authorities have linked them to the vaping of key marijuana ingredients or nicotine. Most of the cases seem to be cannabis-related, state and federal health officials say.\n\nOn Thursday, New York state health officials said they identified vitamin E acetate, or oil, in some samples of vaping products linked to several cases and have made it a key focus in their investigation.\n\nLate Friday, the Food and Drug Administration announced that people should avoid THC-containing products specifically. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is a compound in marijuana known for its psychoactive effects and has been associated with many of the illnesses. They also said that most of the THC products tested contained \u201csignificant amounts\u201d of vitamin E acetate, echoing the findings in New York.\n\nThe FDA still cautions that there isn\u2019t enough evidence to pinpoint vitamin E acetate as the cause of the illnesses, but people should avoid inhaling the substance. They also warned against buying THC products off the street because consumers can\u2019t be sure whether the unregulated products contain vitamin E acetate.\n\nThere were 35.9 million marijuana vape pens and cartridges sold in the year ended Aug. 31 in licensed recreational marijuana stores in California, Colorado, Nevada and Washington, according to Marijuana Business Daily.\n\nRoughly 13.8 million people in the U.S. were users of nicotine e-cigarettes as of June, according to tobacco giant Altria Group Inc. The company estimates that among them more than seven million use e-cigarettes exclusively.\n\nA spokesman for Juul Labs Inc., which represents about 70% of e-cigarette sales in stores tracked by Nielsen, said the startup has been closely monitoring the situation.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the work of the CDC, FDA and other public health authorities and are confident that they will get to the bottom of this issue,\u201d he said, adding that Juul\u2019s products don\u2019t include vitamin E or any compound derived from cannabis.\n\nAltria, which owns a 35% stake in Juul, declined to comment. Reynolds American Inc., maker of Newport cigarettes, also owns Vuse, the No. 2 U.S. e-cigarette brand. A Reynolds spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are glad to see the CDC has appropriate resources for a fulsome investigation into this issue.\u201d\n\nA decline in nicotine vaping could lead to increased cigarette sales.\n\nAltria is the biggest U.S. cigarette company, and the Marlboro maker\u2019s share price jumped following the CDC\u2019s announcement before finishing the day little changed. Shares of British American Tobacco PLC, which owns Reynolds American, were up 0.8% in after-hours trading.\n\nA CDC spokesman said it is investigating more than 450 vaping cases in 33 states and one U.S. territory, suggesting the number of reports of cases has more than doubled since the agency updated its investigation last week.\n\n\u201cAlthough more investigation is needed to determine the vaping agent or agents responsible, there is clearly an epidemic that begs for an urgent response,\u201d David Christiani, a Harvard University public-health professor, wrote in an editorial published online Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAlso on Friday, the medical journal published three reports providing the most comprehensive look at the vaping-injury cases so far. The CDC reported its own findings after looking at a small number of cases.\n\nOne study looking at 53 patients in Wisconsin and Illinois found abnormalities in the lungs and chests of the patients who were scanned. The researchers believe the inflammation or injury seen in the patients was due to some sort of chemical exposure.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s striking is that, in general, these individuals are young and pretty healthy, and most of them are men,\u201d said Jennifer Layden, the chief medical officer at the Illinois Department of Public Health and first author on the study.\n\nA second report looked at 19 cases and identified abnormalities in the chest scans of all of the patients. There was no one pattern across all of the scans, leading researchers to believe that the injuries most likely have multiple causes, though all linked to vaping.\n\nOne potential sign of the injury is fat buildup in the lungs, which was noted in patients studied in the other two reports.\n\nThe buildup could occur either when people inhale something with oil in it or as a result of inflammation in the lungs from some sort of lung damage, said Sean Callahan, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Utah Health, an author on one of the reports.\n\nAdministering steroids or letting the inflammation clear on its own seems to help treat the illness, doctors say. Because the symptoms from the vaping injuries often look like an infection, some patients are first given antibiotics, but many don\u2019t improve with the drugs.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com", "description": "Federal health authorities are urging people to stop using electronic smoking products while they investigate the death of a third person from a mysterious vaping illness that researchers say may have affected 450 people around the U.S.", "authors": ["Brianna Abbott", "Jennifer Maloney", "Brianna.Abbott Wsj.Com", "Jennifer.Maloney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104843/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
