He appeared to be under the influence of alcohol . Police were contacted and an officer spoke to the defendant. He was asked if he had been drinking.\n\n\"Mr Brunditt said he had been drinking and he had driven from Stoke-on-Trent to Uttoxeter. The officer said the defendant's speech was slurred and his eyes were glazed. He was arrested.\"\n\n(Image: Stoke-on-Trent Live)\n\nThe court heard that Brunditt, of Balance Hill, Uttoxeter, gave an alcohol reading of 94 micrograms in 100 millilitres of breath, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports .\n\nThe legal limit is 35.\n\nBrunditt admitted drink-driving following the incident, on Monday, September 23.\n\nThe court heard that he works for the Harvester chain of restaurants in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nMitigating, Neil Davies said: \"There is no underlying problem with alcohol. He tells me he hasn't drunk a drop since this incident.\"\n\nDeputy district judge John Maxwell ordered the Uttoxeter man to complete 100 hours unpaid work and disqualified him from driving for 22 months.\n\nHe told Brunditt: \"I'm genuinely sorry to see you here before me having your character tarnished in this way, but this is a serious offence.\n\n\"Sitting there drinking a bottle of whisky and driving off is little short of writing a suicide note.\n\n\"You are a young man of good character who comes from a good family. I hope this is a blip.\"\n\nBrunditt was also ordered to pay \u00a3135 court costs and a victim surcharge of \u00a390.", "description": "Alexander Brunditt had drunk a 35cl bottle of whisky at the end of his shift before getting in the car and driving\u00a0 20 miles home", "authors": ["Ben Waldron", "Image", "Stoke-On-Trent Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20744425.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Alexander-Brunditt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
