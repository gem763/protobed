It's expected to produce over 625,000 kilograms annually by early 2020.\n\nConsidering the slow licensing process in Canada concerning retail outlets, and its current shortage of GMP compliant cannabis to sell to overseas market, the company will need to find more outlets for its growing amount of product.\n\nMeanwhile, ACB has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street. This breaks down into 4 'buy', 5 'hold' and 1 'sell' ratings in the last three months. We can also see from TipRanks that the average analyst price target is $8.07 - 45% upside from the current share price. (See ACB's price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks)\n\nCanadian cannabis demand\n\nSome have drawn the wrong conclusion concerning cannabis demand in Canada, saying supply is already outpacing demand, but that's simply not true at this time.\n\nThe reality is demand remains robust, and the lack of retail outlets to sell cannabis through is what has been limiting potential sales for Aurora and other suppliers in the country.\n\nWhile that is slowly starting to improve, it's going to take a lot longer for the full potential to be realized. The legalizing of derivatives will help, but that won't have an impact until the first quarter of 2020, and it remains to be seen how much current sales will be cannibalized by higher-margin and more desirable derivative sales.\n\nHowever it works out, it should result in improvement in the top and bottom lines of the company. That will also be leveraged by the increase in the number of stores cannabis can be bought in.\n\nEuropean Union Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certifications\n\nIn a few weeks Aurora stated it will have two more GMP certifications in Canada. That will provide more product that can be sold in international markets requiring compliance to those standards.\n\nAs mentioned above, global sales have been more modest than expected because of the shortage of medical cannabis that meet GMP standards.\n\nThe two new facilities \u2013 Aurora Vie and Aurora River \u2013 will add a combined annual production capacity of GMP-compliant medical cannabis of about 32,000 kilograms. This will go a long way to boosting sales in global markets.\n\nIt will eat up some of the vast supply becoming available in 2020.\n\nThe U.S. market\n\nA number of analysts and investors have been waiting to see what Aurora is going to do in the U.S. market after it hinted at some significant moves a couple of quarters ago.\n\nCam Battley said this:\n\n\u201cWhat I do expect is within a very short period of time we\u2019ll be entering into the U.S. with another point of entry, and a significant one. \u201cWe\u2019re learning what the strengths and weaknesses are of (multistate operators) and other business models, so we are definitely laser-focused, short term, on CBD derived from hemp, because that can be done now. It\u2019s fully permissible now.\"\n\nAt this time I don't see Aurora being at any competitive disadvantage, as the CBD market in the U.S. is highly commoditized at this time, and any move it makes to differentiate with strong partners could position it for strong sales growth under the right conditions.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Aurora Cannabis (ACB) Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley told Marijuana Business Daily in a recent phone interview that the company was focused on entering the U.S. CBD market in the near future.Within a couple of quarters the company is going to catapult far beyond all of its competitors in relationship", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bDnQzZeYeqKateAIjTDpGg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/bdccfadb78a8e784ceeb349e533caa28", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
