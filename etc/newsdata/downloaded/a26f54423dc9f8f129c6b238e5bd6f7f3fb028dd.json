The climb in yields also weighed on the real estate sector .SPLRCR, which suffered its biggest percentage drop in nearly a month.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 73.92 points, or 0.28%, to 26,909.43, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.96 points, or 0.03%, to 2,979.39 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 3.28 points, or 0.04%, to 8,084.16.\n\nEuropean shares edged higher as the rise in bond yields helped boost bank shares .SX7P by more than 2%, putting them on track for a fifth day of gains. The bank index is up nearly 9% over that span, its best five-day performance since April 2017.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.10%, while MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS was flat after falling as much as 0.54% during the session.\n\nGermany\u2019s DAX rose after Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the country was ready to inject \u201cmany, many billions of euros\u201d into the economy to counter any economic downturn.\n\nThe export-heavy German index was also aided by a Reuters report that Bank of Japan policymakers are more open to discussing the possibility of expanding stimulus at their Sept. 18-19 board meeting due to the broadening fallout of the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, September 6, 2019.
