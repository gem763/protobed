But with Britain\u2019s Oct. 31 departure date looming and just hours to go before the EU leaders\u2019 summit, hopes were increasingly turning toward getting a broad political commitment, with the full legal details to be hammered out later. That could mean another EU summit on Brexit before the end of the month.\n\nNegotiators were locked inside EU headquarters with few details leaking out. Wild movements in the British pound Wednesday underscored the uncertainty over what, if anything, might finally be decided.\n\nMeetings between Barnier and key EU legislators as well as with ambassadors of the member nations were rescheduled for the evening \u2014 an indication there was still momentum in the ongoing talks among technical teams from both sides.\n\nThe focus of recent talks has been the thorniest component of a deal: how goods and people will flow across the land border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K.\n\nSo far, all plans to keep an open and near-invisible border between the two have hit a brick wall of opposition from Johnson\u2019s key Northern Irish ally, the Democratic Unionist Party. Leaders from the party met several times with the British prime minister Wednesday as he tried to win their support. Without it, any Brexit deal is likely to be rejected by Britain\u2019s Parliament \u2014 which has already voted down prospective deals three times.\n\nJohnson told Conservative Party lawmakers on Wednesday that he believed a deal was close.\n\nLegislator Bim Afolami quoted the prime minister as saying \u201cthe summit is in sight, but it is shrouded in cloud. But we can get there.\u201d\n\nNorthern Ireland is not the only issue. The eventual withdrawal agreement will be a legal treaty that also lays out other aspects of the U.K.\u2019s departure \u2014 including issues like the divorce bill Britain must pay to leave and the rights of U.K. and EU citizens living in each other\u2019s territories. It will set up a transition period in which relations would remain as they are now at least until the end of 2020, to give people and businesses time to adjust to new rules.\n\nBut the agreement will likely leave many questions about the future unanswered, and Britain\u2019s departure is sure to be followed by years of negotiations on trade and other issues.\n\nEven if a deal is inked this week, moves in the British Parliament could still mean another delay to Britain\u2019s planned Oct. 31 departure.\n\nU.K. lawmakers are determined to push for another delay rather than risk a chaotic no-deal Brexit that economists say could hurt the economies of both the U.K. and the EU. They have passed a law ordering Johnson\u2019s government to seek to delay the departure if a deal isn\u2019t in place by Saturday.\n\nJohnson has both promised to obey Parliament\u2019s order and vowed to leave the bloc on Oct. 31, deal or no deal.\n\nParliament has also repeatedly rejected previous attempts at a Brexit deal. With the need to get Parliament\u2019s approval looming over negotiations, EU leaders are seeking reassurances from Johnson during this week\u2019s summit that he has the political weight to push any new deal through the House of Commons, which is due to meet Saturday for its first weekend session in almost 40 years.\n\nThe Brexit talks plodded ahead Wednesday, further delaying preparations for the EU summit. Since the weekend, negotiators have been locked in long sessions on how to deal with detailed customs, value-added tax and regulatory issues under British proposals to keep goods and people flowing freely across the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\n\u201cTalks have been constructive, but there still remains a number of significant issues to resolve,\u201d EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said after being briefed by Barnier.\n\nBeyond the questions of disrupting daily life, an open Irish border underpins both the local economy and the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant violence in Northern Ireland. But once Britain exits, that border will turn into an external EU frontier that the bloc wants to keep secure.\n\nThe big question is how far Johnson\u2019s government is prepared to budge on its insistence that the U.K., including Northern Ireland, must leave the EU\u2019s customs union \u2014 something that would require checks on goods passing between the U.K. and the EU.\n\nAn alternative is to have checks in the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern Ireland. But Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP, the party that props up Johnson\u2019s minority Conservative government, strongly opposes any measures that could loosen the bonds between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nPro-Brexit Conservative British lawmaker David Davis said success in passing a Brexit deal rests on the stance of the DUP.\n\n\u201cIf the DUP says, \u2018This is intolerable to us\u2019 that will be quite important,\u201d he said.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster said the party had not yet consented to a deal. She tweeted: \u201cDiscussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support.\u201d", "description": "The European Union and Britain inched ever closer to a Brexit deal on Wednesday, with the leaders of France and Germany saying they expected an agreement...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT450_merkel_ZG_20191016162543.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
