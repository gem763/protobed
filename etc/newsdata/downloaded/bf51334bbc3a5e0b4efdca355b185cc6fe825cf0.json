REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The city of San Francisco has offered to buy PG&E Corp\u2019s (PCG.N) power lines and other electrical system infrastructure serving the city for $2.5 billion, according to the utility, which sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.\n\nPG&E is expected to file a reorganization plan in a U.S. bankruptcy court in San Francisco this week that addresses its estimated $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018, including November\u2019s Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire of the state\u2019s modern history.\n\n\u201cWe all agree on the importance of continuing to serve the citizens of San Francisco with safe, clean, affordable and reliable energy,\u201d PG&E said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Karly Hernandez on Sunday.\n\n\u201cPG&E has been a part of San Francisco since the company\u2019s founding more than a century ago, and while we don\u2019t believe municipalization is in the best interests of our customers and stakeholders, we are committed to working with the City and will remain open to communication on this issue,\u201d the statement added.\n\nRepresentatives of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe purchase would be funded through a municipal power bond passed by voters last year and would be paid off through customers\u2019 electric bills, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, which also noted the deal would create California\u2019s third-largest government-owned electric utility, after the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.\n\nCorporate reorganization plans generally need widespread support from creditors, and debtors can spend months getting the necessary backing. PG&E\u2019s plan must be approved by U.S. Judge Dennis Montali for the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.\n\nOn June 4, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission said it had hired an adviser to explore a possible acquisition of the company\u2019s distribution assets.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, PG&E\u2019s stock has plunged 57.1%.", "description": "The city of San Francisco has offered to buy PG&E Corp's power lines and other electrical system infrastructure serving the city for $2.5 billion, according to the utility, which sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427696593&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870UY", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
