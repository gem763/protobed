Five sources cited in the Bloomberg report confirmed the move, saying Trump\u2019s request had been handed down to top agency officials by acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien. Two of the sources said the staff reduction stemmed from a desire to boost efficiency as O\u2019Brien transitions into his new role as national security adviser.\n\nThe National Security Council, which currently employs just over 300 people, was mentioned in the whistleblower complaint over Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine that triggered an impeachment inquiry.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daily Beast", "Thedailybeast.Com Trump-Orders-Reduction-Of-National-Security-Council-Staff-Report"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
