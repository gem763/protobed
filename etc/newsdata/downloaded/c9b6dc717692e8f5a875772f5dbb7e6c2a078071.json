The singer was then taken to hospital for surgery on his broken nose.\n\nBut the incident didn't end there. Turan appeared at the hospital with a gun, allegedly begging for forgiveness. Panic ensued after the footballer fired the weapon at the ground.\n\nWriting on Instagram on Wednesday, Turan apologised to his club and his family for his \"momentary mistake\".\n\nHowever, he said the allegation he verbally harassed Ms Sahin was \"a heavy and ugly slander\". The Turkish court acquitted him of sexual harassment charges on Wednesday.\n\n\"I learned lessons from these events,\" he wrote. \"My greatest aim is to make my family, my dear wife, my club and friends proud.\"\n\nWho is Arda Turan?\n\nThe Turkish midfielder began his career at Galatasaray as a teenager. He was named captain at the age of 21.\n\nHe moved to Spanish club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2011, and then to Barcelona in 2015. The club loaned him to Istanbul Basaksehir in 2018.\n\nTuran has scored 17 goals in 100 senior appearances for his country, making him the fourth most-capped Turkish player of all time.\n\nBut he announced his international retirement in 2017 after he allegedly abused a journalist on the national team's plane.\n\nLast year, Turan received a 16-game ban for shoving an assistant referee with both hands. He received a straight red card and a fine.\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "Arda Turan gets a suspended sentence for firing a gun in a hospital following a fight with a singer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14F37/production/_108751858_gettyimages-633869434.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
