The latest results from the CMA came from a survey of 13,760 people carried out between July 2018 and June 2019.\n\nAs well as asking customers whether they'd recommend their bank account provider, the survey also asks customers to rate their bank's service in branches, its online and mobile banking offering and its overdrafts.\n\nThe top two of Metro Bank and First Direct were followed by five of the UK's biggest bank account providers in Nationwide, Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC, Santander and NatWest.\n\nTSB's popularity climbed 5 per cent on last year to 56 per cent as it recovered from a 2018 overshadowed by massive IT problems. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, it remained bottom of the table when it came to its online and mobile banking, with just 63 per cent of customers saying they'd recommend the bank's offering.\n\nThe full table for online and mobile banking is below:\n\nThe survey also assessed branch service, overdraft services and online and mobile banking. Barclays came top when it came to its digital offering with TSB at the bottom\n\nBarclays came top of that table, with 86 per cent recommending its online and mobile banking, followed by First Direct, Metro Bank and Nationwide.\n\nWhen it came to overdrafts First Direct came top in its own right with 77 per cent saying they'd recommend it to friends and family, followed by Metro, Barclays, HSBC and Santander. First Direct offers a \u00a3250 interest-free overdraft buffer for its current account customers.\n\nThe CMA's league tables are also designed to help people make an informed choice if they decide to switch.
