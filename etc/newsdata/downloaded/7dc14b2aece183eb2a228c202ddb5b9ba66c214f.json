This has never been done before to identify a new species.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The strongest shock previously recorded was 650 volts.\n\nWhile the voltage is high, the team said due to the low amperage of the shocks, they are unlikely to be lethal to humans.\n\nIn the traditional analogy for understanding measurements of electricity, instead of an electrical wire, imagine a hose pipe. The water is the electricity, and the voltage is the water pressure \u2013 set at a certain level whether the tap is on or off. The amplitude is the rate at which water flows down the hose pipe when the tap is switched on \u2013 this is also governed by the resistance, measured in ohms \u2013 the level of which is equivalent to the size of the hose pipe.\n\nAccording to Dr Santana, who has entered many rivers to collect electric eels for research purposes and been shocked more than once, the discharge is high voltage but low amperage (approximately 1 amp), so it is not necessarily dangerous to humans.\n\nAs a comparison, a shock from a power outlet can be 10 or 20 amps.\n\nNonetheless, a shock from the world\u2019s most powerful electric eel would not be a pleasant experience.\n\n\u201cI remember the first time I was shocked,\u201d Dr de Santana told the New York Times. \u201cI was scared,\u201d he said, adding he had dropped his equipment.\n\nThe research team also learned more about the social characteristics of the animals. Electric eels had previously been thought of as solitary creatures, stalking prey on their own under cover of darkness.\n\nThey reported that the eels had been observed working together to coordinate their predatory manoeuvres, almost like lions on a hunt, but lions armed with electricity.\n\n\u201cThis social behaviour is quite unusual,\u201d Professor Menzes said. \u201cThey come together in a school, surround the fish they feed on, release electricity and kill it.\u201d\n\nThe research is published in Nature Communications.", "description": "A previously undiscovered species of electric eel which delivers a shock with more than three times the voltage of a domestic plug socket has been discovered in the Amazon rainforest.
