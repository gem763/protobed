Not to fret, we\u2019ve put together a list of the best places in London to gorge on delicious dishes. From scrambled goodness at the newly-opened Eggslut to Middle Eastern-inspired treats at The Good Egg, prepare to salivate.\n\nOn the other hand, if you hate eggs (how, why, no) look away now.\n\nThe Good Egg, Stoke Newington\n\nEggs for everyone (Picture: The Good Egg)\n\nGet here early or bring water to sip on while you stand in the queue.\n\nThe Good Egg has that hipster-vibe, with Middle Eastern vibes that will make you wish you\u2019d added date jam, pickled cucumber and mango amba to your favourite breakfast dishes sooner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother favourite is the Iraqi aubergine pita, filled with eggs, fried aubergine, tahini, mango amba, dak dak, pickles and zhoug. Get a flatbread, honey and za\u2019atar starter while you wait.\n\nIt\u2019s a very low-key joint, with an open kitchen and a mixed crowd, including dogs. There\u2019s also a site in Soho.\n\nEggslut, Notting Hill\n\nOur mouths are watering (Picture: Eggslut)\n\nOriginally from Los Angeles, Eggslut is all about comfort food, but with an inventive spin.\n\nThe classic breakfast sandwich is a must but you\u2019l struggle to keep the scrambled, lush contents from spilling out. Spice things up with the \u2018Fairfax\u2019; eggs, chive, cheddar cheese, caramelised onions and sriracha mayo.\n\nThere\u2019s the added benefit of knowing that you can eat comfortably, because these eggs come from cage-free hens.\n\nGuaranteed Insta-goods.\n\nApr\u00e8s Food Co, Clerkenwell\n\nIt\u2019s all about nutrition at this joint (Price: Apr\u00e9s Food Co)\n\nNutrition meets good cooking at this brunch spot.\n\nThink of it as healthy food that isn\u2019t all about kale. There\u2019s no gluten or refined sugar used at the caf\u00e9, and owners Catherine and Danny use Fairtrade products wherever possible.\n\nThe menu isn\u2019t overtly egg-inspired \u2013 sorry \u2013 but the Apr\u00e9s Eggs is worth the trip to Clerkenwell, a plate full of organic tomatoes, onion, red pepper and spinach sauce, cooked with fresh coriander, organic lemon juice and cayenne pepper, topped with a poached egg, feta cheese and probiotic yoghurt.\n\nDown with an organically-grown wheatgrass shot because, what else?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Table Caf\u00e9, Southwark\n\nSo lush (Picture: The Table Cafe)\n\nBeware of queues at The Table Cafe, as it can get busy with the pre-Tate crowd. The black pudding and bacon eggs Benedict is extremely good, as are the hash browns, and even though they\u2019re way overpriced, the juices are super fresh and make you feel like you\u2019re keeping scurvy from the door.\n\nIn general, a light and airy vibe for a civilised brunch.\n\nEggbreak, Notting Hill Fancy something a bit different? (Picture: Eggbreak) If it\u2019s eggs you\u2019re after, and eggs alone, this is the place. From Turkish eggs to burrata and truffle scrambled eggs to lamb hash with a fried egg or smoked tofu Benedict, it\u2019s all eggs everywhere. The bread selection is excellent too; cornbread, rye, pitta, sourdough, Challah (kosher, breaded loaf) and gluten-free. Obviously served with eggs. How many times can we say eggs in one paragraph? A lot.\n\nCrispin, Spitalfields\n\nIt\u2019s all about fried goodness (Picture: Crispin)\n\nCrispin\u2019s interior might be all about minimalism, but the food certainly isn\u2019t.\n\nThe restaurant is the brainchild of Scotchtails \u2013 makers of \u2018artisan\u2019 Scotch eggs in Hackney and coffee experts, Lundenwic in Aldwych, meaning you\u2019re guaranteed a tasty egg dish and great coffee to boot.\n\nGo for a millennial classic \u2013 avocado on sourdough, poached egg, chilli salt, chives and lime \u2013 or why not try the poached eggs with brown butter hollandaise, kale, smoked salmon or coppa ham.\n\nAnother delight is the three cheese and onion toastie, stuffed with a fried egg and Berkswell fromage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRovi, Fitzrovia\n\nYes, please (Picture: Rovi)\n\nFancy posh eggs made by a celebrity chef?\n\nIsraeli-English chef Yotam Ottolenghi has recently opened a new restaurant in Fitzrovia, aptly named Rovi, with Middle Eastern marvels on the menu.\n\nYou\u2019ll quickly learn that this isn\u2019t your average brunch: sample green shakshuka with a duck\u2019s egg and toasted focaccia or munch on jalape\u00f1o cornbread with scrambled eggs, avocado and tomato.\n\nTo be enjoyed with a fruit kombucha, fresh juice or a Bloody Mary.\n\nHawksmoor, Seven Dials\n\nHow about some bone marrow with those eggs? (Picture: Hawksmoor)\n\nWe\u2019re cheating with this one, because Hawksmoor isn\u2019t actually a brunch spot \u2013 but we\u2019re making this exception with good reason.\n\nMeat-eaters, this is where you will make your home.\n\nStart by choosing a large cut of something (Porterhouse, perhaps) and add two fried eggs, maple bacon and finish off with the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, a large grilled bone marrow.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling really greedy, there\u2019s also the option of half a native lobster with garlic butter. Either way, you\u2019re not leaving hungry.\n\nMORE: An ode to eggs, the single greatest food in the world\n\nMORE: Are you haunted by this DIY craft video of an egg getting bigger?\n\nMORE: Nowhere near John Lewis?
