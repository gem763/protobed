Many times, I copy something to my clipboard, and before pasting, I accidentally overwrite it by copying something else.

Thanks, CTRL+C Snafu\n\nDear CTRL+C Snafu,\n\nYou neglected to specify what operating system you use, Sunny, but that\u2019s fine! I\u2019ll cover both Windows and macOS, so everyone can figure out how to restore that which they accidentally overwrote on their clipboards. (And, yes, this is a problem I have, too, so I\u2019m glad we\u2019re talking about it.)\n\nTo start, I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re on Windows 10 (if you\u2019re a Windows user), and you\u2019re running the latest version of the operating system. Open up the Settings app, click on System, scroll the left sidebar down a bit, and click on Clipboard. I\u2019ve already enabled my Clipboard History, so your screen should look kind of like this\u2014but you\u2019ll want to enable your Clipboard History if it\u2019s unchecked.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nScroll down a bit, and you can also use this screen to clear your clipboard history:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nNow, whenever you press Windows Key + V (not CTRL + V), your clipboard history will pop up on your screen. Click on anything on the list to paste it wherever your cursor happens to be. It\u2019s as easy as that.\n\nEnabling Clipboard History on macOS\n\nYou\u2019ll need a third-party app to enable a true clipboard history on your Mac\u2014the built-in clipboard stores one item and one item only. Some options you can explore include CopyClip, Paste (which is super-expensive), Alfred 4, PasteBot, and the open-source Clipy.\n\nThey\u2019re all pretty easy to use, and they should give you a foolproof method for preserving that which you\u2019ve copied (for a short time, if nothing else). I\u2019d probably go for the free or inexpensive apps first\u2014especially those with some kind of trial\u2014so you can feel out whether it meets your needs before you pay anything, if you even decide to go that route. Really, this should be a staple inclusion in the operating system itself, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Apple dumps this feature into a future version of macOS at some point.", "description": "Dear Lifehacker.
