It is a thing to be soberly considered. It is a sign that the character and behavior of the target \u2014 in this case the president \u2014 is being searched for deficiency (in this case already demonstrated) and the American electorate has been betrayed.\n\nThis is a funeral; it is not festive.\n\nStill, it is awe-inspiring and reaffirming to see politicians put what is right above that which might be risky, to stand on principal in an area consumed by political expediency.\n\nThis step, whatever may flow from it, reinforced the public\u2019s faith that the rich and powerful can, too, be subject to the law, that fairness and justice are still principles of primacy in this land.", "description": "An impeachment inquiry is nothing to celebrate.
