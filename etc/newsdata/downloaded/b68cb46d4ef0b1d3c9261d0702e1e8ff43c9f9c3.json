France currently has no law banning mothers from wearing the hijab on school trips.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Macron called for a better understanding of the Muslim religion in France and condemned what he described as the \"fatal shortcut\" of linking Islam with terrorism.\n\n\"There is a lot of irresponsibility among political commentators,\" he said, adding: \"Communalism is not terrorism.\"\n\n'My son approached me crying'\n\nThe incident at the regional parliament building in eastern France occurred during a school trip on Friday 11 October in which Fatima accompanied her young son.\n\nA politician from Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally - formerly known as the National Front - saw her during a debate and ordered her to remove her veil.\n\nJulien Odoul posted his verbal exchange on Twitter along with a message citing a fatal knife attack on four police officers in Paris earlier this month which has been linked to Islamist radicalisation.\n\n\"After the murder of our four policemen, we cannot tolerate this [provocation],\" he wrote.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @JulienOdoul \ud83d\udd34 [RT]Au nom de nos principes r\u00e9publicains et la\u00efcs, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 @MarieGuiteDufay de faire enlever le voile islamique d\u2019une accompagnatrice scolaire pr\u00e9sente dans l\u2019h\u00e9micycle.

I told them I could not stay.\"\n\nHer lawyer, Sana Ben Hadj, said her client felt \"humiliated\" after images of the incident were widely shared.\n\nCCIF said Fatima was filing a complaint in the city of Dijon over \"violence of a racial nature committed... by persons with public authority\", adding that a further complaint would be filed in Paris for \"incitement of racial hatred\".\n\nHeadscarf part of wider debate\n\nThe incident has also sparked a debate over mothers wearing a headscarf going on school trips, when teachers are not allowed to.\n\nEducation Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer was widely criticised for suggesting the veil was \"not desirable\" in French society, and Marine Le Pen has called for it to be banned on school trips.\n\nA ban on Muslim headscarves and other \"conspicuous\" religious symbols at state schools in France was introduced in 2004.\n\nIt received overwhelming political and public support in a country where the separation of state and religion is enshrined in law.\n\nIn 2011, France became the first European country to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public places, while alternatives such as hijabs, which cover the head and hair, remained legal.\n\nUnder the ban no woman, French or foreign, is able to leave their home with their face hidden behind a veil without running the risk of a fine.\n\nFormer French President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose administration introduced the ban, said veils oppressed women and were \"not welcome\" in France.\n\nMore on Muslim women and the veil:", "description": "Protests erupt in France as a Muslim mother accuses a far-right politician of \"racial violence\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13CB4/production/_109267018_gettyimages-1146681939.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
