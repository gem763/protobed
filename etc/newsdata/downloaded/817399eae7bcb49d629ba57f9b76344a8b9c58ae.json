Crenshaw suggested he would loan a gun to a friend. \u201cThe people you\u2019re giving a gun to have likely abused their spouse or have a violent criminal record,\u201d she wrote. And then she demanded to know why Crenshaw would hand his domestic-abuser-friend a gun. Crenshaw replied that it was offensive to suggest his friends couldn\u2019t pass a background check and added that in \u201cAmerica outside NYC\u201d people lend their guns to friends for hunting or protection. AOC then doubled-down:\n\nHerein lies an important point abt domestic abuse: most of it is hidden. You could know an abuser & have no clue. I\u2019ve had friends come out to me as victims. It\u2019s not obvious. Unsafe relationships are COMMON. That\u2019s why House Dems passed closing the boyfriend loophole in VAWA. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 4, 2019\n\nTo be clear, Crenshaw wasn\u2019t saying his friends couldn\u2019t pass a background check. He was saying that the law would put up a public barrier to a private decision. AOC is intentionally misconstruing his point to justify her response. Adding \u201cTry to keep up\u201d is a nice touch of arrogance when you\u2019re lying about what someone said.\n\nBut that still wasn\u2019t the end of it. Author Emily Miller, who has written a book about gun ownership, expressed support for Rep. Crenshaw and then argued that loaning a gun to a friend wasn\u2019t irresponsible because you would know your friends. AOC jumped in again on her response to claim that anyone you know could be a secret domestic abuser:\n\nThis idea of \u201cI know the guy, there\u2019s no way he beats his wife\u201d as the way we keep guns out of the hands of abusers is ridiculous. Any person who has been abused, assaulted, etc knows that abusers often present as \u201cupstanding.\u201d There\u2019s no way you\u2019d know. That\u2019s why it\u2019s common. https://t.co/uuq17HT3Of \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 4, 2019\n\nEmily Miller pointed out she knows something about that:\n\nYour assumption about me is wrong. I've been both abused and sexually assaulted. That's why I have a gun. Self defense. And I would loan my gun to any of my close girlfriends who needed it for their self defense. \u2014 EMILYMILLER (@EmilyMiller) September 4, 2019\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t even a bump in the road for AOC. Standard operating procedure for AOC on Twitter is to always be lecturing. She knows more than you about everything, even your own close friends (who are actually horrible people it turns out).\n\nDomestic abusers can be master manipulators. Plus, domestic abuse is a HUGE indicator for gun violence. That\u2019s why \u201cvouching for friend\u201d isn\u2019t a substitute for a background check. You wouldn\u2019t lend a car to someone w/o a license.Why lend a gun to someone w/o a background check? \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 4, 2019\n\nThere are several distinct ways in which this argument is dumb. For one thing, the only way a background check would prevent you from loaning a gun to a secret abuser/rapist is if the secret abuser already had a conviction for domestic abuse or rape. But if the abuse is truly hidden from everyone by a master manipulator then the background check would find nothing.\n\nSecondly, the comparison to a driver\u2019s license is silly. Bank robbers can have a driver\u2019s license like everyone else. Independently, having a license is no guarantee someone isn\u2019t planning a heist or worse, some sort of ISIS-inspired truck attack. But if my friend wanted to borrow my mini-van, I wouldn\u2019t run a background check to see if he\u2019d ever been a getaway driver or was on a terror watchlist. I guess it\u2019s possible he could be secretly plotting evil deeds, but it\u2019s more likely he just wants to pick up some lumber at Home Depot.\n\nSo what have we learned here? We\u2019ve learned that all of our friends might actually be rapists and we won\u2019t know unless we check a government database. Also, we\u2019ve learned that there is nothing AOC can say, not matter how dumb or insulting, that 15,000+ of her fans won\u2019t hit the like button.", "description": "\"Good appearances are often a cover for abusers.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AOC-blue-suit.jpg"}
