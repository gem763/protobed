WeWork has postponed their IPO. SmileDirectClub and Peloton are down from their list prices,\" Brian Halmilton, founder of Hamilton IPO told FoxBusiness.com. \"In particular, I think WeWork\u2019s volatile valuation followed by the delay of its IPO may cause some companies to take pause.\"\n\nPause indeed.\n\nNew York magazine reported today that Google executives met with WeWork's marketing team in August to discuss an advertising buy for the then soon-to-go-public company. Google examined its search data on WeWork in advance of the meeting only to learn that WeWork had \u201cthe most alarming negative sentiment trends\" the search giant had seen \"compared to prior companies in similar situations.\u201d\n\nThese come on the heels of two of the most anticipated IPOs of the year: rideshare start-ups Uber and Lyft. The former saw its shares slide more than 7% on the day of its IPO in May and since then and have fallen more than 30%. Meanwhile, rival Lyft listed its shares at $71 in April.

The subscription-based website, which offers an offbeat look at sports journalism, has seen solid growth and expansion over the past two years.\n\nThe current valuation for the site, which hopes to boast one million subscribers by the end of the year, is currently $300 million the sports media web site Awful Announcing reported utilizing information from the financial data company, Pitchbook.\n\nMoving forward, IPO offerings will be viewed with a certain level of scrutiny in light of recent trends according to long-time IPO watcher Hamilton.\n\n\"The concern of an upcoming recession may be playing into this as well. This is the longest bull market we have seen. A lot of these companies have failed to show they are recession-proof, and when you combine that with a lack of profit, it doesn't bode well for Postmates and Airbnb,\" Hamilton said.\n\nDisclosure: The author had previously written for The Athletic\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The current market climate may not be receptive for IPOs given some recent under-performing offerings.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/WeWork-grab.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
