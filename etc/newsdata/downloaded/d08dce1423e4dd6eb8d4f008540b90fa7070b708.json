Not on Wednesday, as concerns about overseas economic weakness and trade wars ganged up on the market and took everything down with them.\n\nCyclical sectors that tend to fall in times of economic concern got slammed, but so did \u201cdefensive\u201d sectors like Utilities and Consumer Staples as stocks suffered the worst day since late August. Small-caps are getting hit hard, and are within a few points of bear market territory. Only bonds and gold really got a lift Wednesday as it looks like caution is back in a big way.\n\nConsumers Still Running the Show?\n\nUntil this week, healthy U.S. consumers appeared to keep the momentum flowing on Wall Street despite economic weakness in Europe and trade worries. The consumer has been carrying growth domestically, but with so much continued weak data elsewhere, there\u2019s growing fear it could start to hit U.S. shoppers. That said, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet pointing to a weakening U.S. consumer, only some hints that sentiment about the future might be coming down. We\u2019d arguably need to see a slowdown in wage growth or a drop in retail sales (and not for just a single report) to verify any change in the consumer picture here.\n\nWhile many analysts believe recession concerns are overblown, we could get more clues about U.S. consumer health in coming days. The payrolls report Friday might be paramount. If it shows wage growth declining, that could potentially lead people to believe economic problems are getting worse and send the market down again.\n\nTo keep things in perspective, this was only the second day of heavy selling, which is far from a trend. There\u2019s nothing unusual about what\u2019s happening, and major technical support levels didn\u2019t get breached. All of this might offer some hope for later this week, especially as investors await key jobs data from the government on Friday.\n\nHeightened Economic Concerns Sparked by New Trade Fears\n\nGrowing economic worries, which got their initial spark on Tuesday from soft U.S. manufacturing data Tuesday, appeared to get worse Wednesday. That was partly due in part to a World Trade Organization (WTO) decision that raised fears of more trade tension between the U.S. and Europe even as the U.S. grapples over trade relations with China.\n\nThe U.S. plans to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of E.U. imports after the WTO\u2019s ruling, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday. This added to trade trepidation and might have helped pressure the market after it posted some recovery from its lows earlier in the afternoon. By the closing bell, the ($DJI) was down 800 points in just two days. It\u2019s a little like the quick descent we saw back in early August, which was also trade-related.\n\nTransports really put on the brakes, with some of the major airlines like United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE: ) getting smacked around. Both fell more than 5% by late in the session. Auto manufacturers also had a bad day. On days like these, you\u2019d almost expect to see weakness in more aggressive parts of the market like transports, Technology and Energy, but it was a bit surprising to see Utilities fall 1.25%, Health Care fall 1.5%, and Consumer Staples fall nearly 2%. Those are the places some investors tend to go when things get volatile.\n\nInstead, it looks like people fled Wednesday away from equities and into bonds and gold. The fell back below 1.6%. For reference, it was briefly above 1.9% in mid-September. One point to potentially watch is 1.42%, which is around the three-year low that the 10-year yield posted back in early September. Some analysts think that barring a re-test of that, the market won\u2019t necessarily fall out of bed.\n\nGold climbed 1% to back above $1,500 an ounce. That\u2019s still a ways from the early September highs up around $1,560, which could be another level worth watching if you\u2019re tracking investor sentiment.\n\nEyeing the Surface Cracks\n\nThe U.S. economy has chugged along, growing around 2% even while some other economies see slower growth and grapple with negative interest rates. Now there appear to be a few cracks on the surface, which we saw early this week with a round of weak data from the U.S. and overseas, along with political worries at home and geopolitical turmoil in Asia, the U.K., and the Middle East.\n\nWith October a historically volatile and sometimes difficult month, it seems pretty natural that some people might approach things with caution here and lighten the load a bit. What\u2019s not really apparent yet is any major change in the pattern that would lead you to think it\u2019s a repeat of Q4 2018 when things really went south.\n\nSome people are making comparisons to the Q4 washout last year, but that\u2019s not really all that valid. For one thing, rates are falling, not rising as they were then. Also, the market isn\u2019t as reliant on the fortunes of just a few big companies like it was a year ago. The rally since January has been pretty widespread, with Technology a leader but also with participation from lots of other sectors.\n\nSome immediate cracks in the bullish thesis showed up with yesterday\u2019s U.S. manufacturing data, auto U.K. , and growth warnings from Germany\u2019s leading institutes. Brexit jitters and China trade worries haven\u2019t gone away either, but they\u2019ve been out there all year and the SPX was up 20% in going into October.\n\nAs we noted earlier this week, October could have some bright spots despite the troubled start. Talks with China begin next week. Earnings season is getting close and could offer a welcome break from all the noise.\n\nGetting Technical\n\nConsider taking a breath and remembering the 2800 to 3000 range we\u2019ve been talking about for the . We\u2019re coming off the high end of that range and heading down, but unless the SPX takes out lows near the 200-day moving average\u2014which is around 2837 as of Wednesday\u2014you could argue we\u2019re still not technically in really bearish territory. A test of that level or a drop below it for a day or two might change sentiment on the Street in a major way.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being cautious or even taking some profit if you feel your exposure to stocks is higher than you originally planned. Where people might go wrong is by making seat-of-the-pants trading decisions based on fear instead of their long-term goals. The SPX fell to 2350 last December, and anyone who got nervous and sold then might be regretting it now. Sure, there\u2019s no rule that says the SPX can\u2019t fall back to that point. Even so, if you believe earnings can start to recover in coming quarters and we don\u2019t face any signs of an immediate recession, that might be a tough argument to make.\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index ( ) ran up some gains Tuesday and Wednesday to back above 20 for the first time since early August. Still, it\u2019s stayed below the August highs so far. That might bear watching, especially if it goes above 22 or 23. A move like that could potentially signal more concern and possibly more market turbulence ahead, because that\u2019s pretty much where things topped out in August.\n\nStock Volatility And Crude Weakness\n\nhttps://tickertapecdn.tdameritrade.com/assets/images/pages/xs/vix-crude-10-2-19.jpg 2x\" />\n\nFIGURE 1: STOCK VOLATILITY AND CRUDE WEAKNESS. The Cboe Volatility Index ( - candlestick) rocketed above 20 Wednesday amid weakness in the manufacturing sector and concerns trade dynamics might be taking their toll on the economy. One place this tends to manifest itself is in prices (/CL - purple line). Note that crude, which has fallen about $10 a barrel in the last couple weeks, has seen several sharply lower moves concurrent with sharply higher moves in the so-called fear index.
