The ad, purchased by the New Faces PAC, starts out with a with a still of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s official congressional portrait \u2014 then sets it on fire:\n\nThe Republican New Faces PAC debuted by burning @AOC's face. pic.twitter.com/JFowetC7Nd \u2014 CPD Action (@CPDAction) September 13, 2019\n\nThe next scene shows a heap of skulls, and then cuts to Elizabeth Heng, a failed Republican candidate for California\u2019s 16th congressional district. In ominous tones, Heng, the daughter of a Cambodian dissident, recalls the violence of the Khmer Rouge regime and warns against socialism in the U.S. The implication is clear: Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist, represents a real and serious threat to the U.S., and if she and other leftists grow their power, mass murder is inevitable.\n\nIt\u2019s a uniquely odious example of an old conservative habit. But that habit isn\u2019t merely obnoxious \u2014 it puts the congresswoman at risk, too. Ocasio-Cortez, along with other members of her left-leaning congressional \u201csquad,\u201d already receives a high number of death threats; by allowing this PAC to air an ad that links her to genocidal violence in Cambodia, ABC grants undeserved legitimacy to ideas that make her a target.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the Freedom From Religion Foundation \u2014 a legal advocacy group that promotes separation of church and state \u2014 claims the channel rejected two of its proposed ads for the same night. And later in its broadcast, ABC aired an ad funded by NumbersUSA, an anti-immigration organization. Political Research Associations has reported that the group\u2019s president, Roy Beck, once spoke to a white nationalist groups and formerly edited The Social Contract, a journal that puts out what the Southern Poverty Law Center has called \u201crace-bating articles penned by white nationalists.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez has already responded, noting the irony of a Republican PAC doing outreach to minorities by smearing a woman of color:\n\nRepublicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren\u2019t racist.\n\n\n\nLife is weird! \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nKnow that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color - that was the pretense.\n\n\n\nWhat you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case. https://t.co/zvp1EB02c5 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nOthers expressed shock at the ad, and ABC\u2019s decision to run it:\n\nTrump officials and GOP senators were asked to leave a few restaurants and we had a whole news cycle about a lack of 'civility' on the part of the left.\n\n\n\nThe GOP, on the other hand, just set @AOC's face on fire.#bothsides https://t.co/zzJrNNCIZb \u2014 Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) September 13, 2019\n\nThis ad is abhorrent. Literally burning @AOC and promoting violence against a sitting member of congress. How did you let this on the air @ABCNetwork? #DemDebate https://t.co/IIasHeoyXc \u2014 UltraViolet (@UltraViolet) September 13, 2019\n\nThis is the ad @ABC allowed to run during tonight's #DemDebate: right-wing propaganda depicting @AOC set on fire, burning into images of skeletons.\n\n\n\nThis is right out of the white nationalist playbook. No news network should be profiting off such hatred.pic.twitter.com/11g7k6hf3c \u2014 Bend the Arc: Jewish Action (@jewishaction) September 13, 2019\n\nThe PAC\u2019s ad was ostensibly meant to counter the argument that the GOP is a racist political party. But they\u2019ll need to do more than put Elizabeth Heng in front of camera to make that argument. If they\u2019re truly concerned about the party\u2019s image, they haven\u2019t exactly done their cause any favors.", "description": "ABC is being criticized for allowing the Republican PAC ad to run.", "authors": ["Sarah Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/12/12-gop-ad-aoc-face-burning.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
