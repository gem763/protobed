It\u2019s called satire | Stuart Jeffries", "language": "en", "text": "Satire props up what it should destroy. Chris Morris, a satirist himself, understands this as well as anyone. \u201cSatire placates the court,\u201d he told Jon Snow on Channel 4 news recently. \u201cYou do a nice dissection of the way things are in the orthodox elite and the orthodox elite slaps you on the back and says, \u2018Jolly good. Can we have some more?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe return of Have I Got News for You last week, for its 58th series, only confirms Morris\u2019s point. Poetry, wrote WH Auden, changes nothing. Satire is worse than poetry: it has made us a nation of giggling couch potatoes, laughing at what we don\u2019t have the gumption to change.\n\nThe laughter Johnson attracts serves as a force field to stop us thinking too hard about the hash he is making of the UK\n\nIn Dialectic of Enlightenment, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer wrote, \u201cIn the false society laughter is a sickness infecting happiness and drawing it into society\u2019s worthless totality.\u201d I thought of the Frankfurt School\u2019s diagnosis of the sickness of laughter when I read the blurb to a new book called The Shitshow. Like HIGNFY, the book\u2019s authors, Steve Lowe and Alan McArthur, have created a successful satirical franchise that leaves what it satirises untouched. It started in 2005 with the book Is it Just Me or is Everything Shit? and continued through sequels and audio books, before now being disinterred in time to capitalise on Christmas 2019\u2019s lucrative stocking-filler market. \u201cSo it turns out things can get even shitter. Who knew? Er, we did, sadly. Still have to laugh. You, like, have to. So let\u2019s.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s not. Satire and laughter are not just displacement activities of supine Britons. Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, in fact, unwittingly helped Boris Johnson become prime minister. In a superb essay in the London Review of Books, the novelist Jonathan Coe recalled a moment 21 years ago when Johnson went on HIGNFY. Hislop had Johnson on the ropes over his notorious phone call with his friend Darius Guppy, when the pair discussed the possibility of beating up an unfriendly journalist. Eventually, Merton interjected with a gag \u2013 ending the inquisition and letting Johnson off the hook. Instead of a possible thug plotting something criminal, Johnson became merely laughable. For the rest of the episode, he could revert to the role in which he was most comfortable \u2013 posh-boy boob channelling Hugh Grant, Billy Bunter and Toad of Toad Hall.\n\nIn subsequent performances as guest and host on the show, Johnson finessed this persona. \u201cBoris Johnson has become his own satirist,\u201d wrote Coe, \u201csafe, above all, in the knowledge that the best way to make sure the satire aimed at you is gentle and unchallenging is to create it yourself.\u201d In our cynical age, all politicians come in for derision, but Johnson managed to turn that to his advantage: he made his buffoonish persona charming \u2013 to some demographics, at least.\n\nIt worked. Six years after Coe\u2019s article, Johnson is the prime minister we deserve. Today, Johnson is stronger for being laughable, and the laughter he attracts serves as a force field to stop us thinking too hard about the hash he is making of the UK\u2019s gravest crisis since Suez. Better to giggle over Jon Culshaw\u2019s send-up of Johnson on Radio 4\u2019s Dead Ringers than do the hard work of comprehending the self-satirising disaster of Johnson\u2019s plan for multiple checkpoints in post-Brexit Ireland.\n\nThis is what author Malcolm Gladwell calls the \u201csatire paradox\u201d: the funnier someone finds it, the less likely they are to be changed by it. And it\u2019s hardly a new problem. During the UK\u2019s \u201csatire boom\u201d, in the early 1960s, Michael Frayn worried that its purported targets were left unscathed. \u201cCertain kinds of satirical writing (political satire is a good example) are not normally intended to convert one\u2019s opponents, but to gratify and fortify one\u2019s friends,\u201d he wrote. That\u2019s why we should have few hopes that the return of Spitting Image will have much effect: after all, it achieved nothing first time around apart from making us laugh. Or consider Yes, Minister, another 1980s satire. Margaret Thatcher liked it because it showed her what she wanted, namely a civil service that needed to be cut down to size.\n\nSatire then, as now, doesn\u2019t so much tell truth to power as give a pretext for power to extend its remit while we aren\u2019t paying proper attention. J\u00fcrgen Habermas described this in his book Legitimation Crisis as \u201ccivic privatism\u201d: we citizens had abandoned our duty of scrutinising politics in favour of \u201ccareer, leisure and consumption\u201d. Laughter, as produced by satire, facilitates that civic privatism.\n\nMeanwhile, another satirical TV news quiz is due to return shortly. Mock the Week effectively mocks the weak, namely its demographic of couch potatoes, by inviting its powerless audience to laugh instead of changing what they are laughing at. Satire has become a vice rather than a corrective to vice, and laughter not the best medicine but the UK\u2019s chronic disease.\n\nHere\u2019s why Boris Johnson\u2019s plans have every chance of falling apart | Tom Kibasi Read more\n\nCan it do better? \u201cThese times should bring on something with more clout,\u201d Morris told Snow. Morris\u2019s new film, The Day Shall Come, dramatises the absurd true story of how the FBI became the biggest recruiters of terrorists in the US. It would make up a terrorist plot, find people to try to carry it out and then arrest them. The aim? To make it look like the feds were on top of terrorism. Certainly no one in the Trump administration or the FBI is going to be patting Morris on the back. Yet like all satire in today\u2019s era of fake news, the film risks angrily preaching to the choir and bolstering its cynicism, while the satirised carry on regardless.\n\n\u201cThese are the headlines,\u201d Chris Morris\u2019s deadpan newsreader said on The Day Today, his mid-1990s news spoof. \u201cGod, I wish they weren\u2019t.\u201d Today the headlines are even worse but satire\u2019s chance of changing them is just as remote.\n\n\u2022 Stuart Jeffries is a feature writer", "description": "Shows like Have I Got News for You merely invite audiences to laugh at what they don\u2019t have the gumption to change, says features writer Stuart Jeffries", "authors": ["Stuart Jeffries"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a260e0307f382842e9777d174992b1152bf3e7cf/0_128_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c7b95f94668c967d0c325139eb395ca7", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
