These vending machines are strategically located in places that are teeming with people. People can throw their water bottles inside this machine, and this plastic can be shredded into pieces and further recycled for other purposes, such as laying roads.\n\nMuch before the plastic ban imposition, Coimbatore Corporation has been taking serious steps to curb single-use plastics, and also promoting alternatives to such bags under its smart city initiative. They also set up a platform to give traders, and businesses eco-friendly alternatives to plastic, along with the Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore (RAAC) and the media.\n\nRegeno Ventures, a Coimbatore-based company which entered into recyclable bag manufacturing in 2016, showcased their bags made from tapioca starch and other vegetable material through this initiative.\n\nBCCL/Representational Image\n\nDon't Miss 229 SHARES 3.6 K SHARES 141 SHARES\n\nCibhi Selven, who started the company says, \u201cWe had great support from the Corporation, We capitalised on the launch and spread the marketing campaign. This was a platform to launch our product. The Corporation not just roped us in, but also other start-ups that were giving alternatives to plastic.\u201d\n\nBiodegradable bags picking up\n\nSuch initiatives have created a change. Hoteliers have swiftly changed to such bags, though such bags are 20% costlier than conventional plastic bags. Ranjana Singhal, a popular restaurateur in Coimbatore says, \u201cI was not waiting for a ban to happen. I was conscious about what I can do as an individual. I saw a video that showed the impacts of plastic straw, and I immediately shifted to paper straws. It has been over a year since I replaced plastic straws with paper straws, thought I had to pay Rs 1.25 per straw.\u201d\n\nBCCL/Representational Image\n\nFrom the beginning, Singhal used only craft paper bags, and she stuck to that until an alternative like corn starch bags arrived in the market, and then she shifted. Not just that. She worked with a woman tailor and asked people to donate old clothes. The tailor made cloth bags out of that, and people were free to pick that up. Also, all the PET bottles were made into planters and were gifted to people.\n\nWhen Cibhi started his company in 2016, plastic ban was just beginning. He says, \u201cPeople are more concerned about the cost. It is much more cost-effective that cotton or paper bags. But everyone wants everything at the price of plastic.\u201d\n\nThe price difference is not huge, according to Cibhi. \u201cWhere a small plastic bag costs 60 paise, this bag will cost you Rs.1.20.\u201d\n\nCurrently Regeno\u2019s bags are sold across the country, and in major cities like New Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.\n\nthinkstock/comyan\n\nCibhi warns people to be wary. He says, \u201cThere are some plastic bags that are sold with \u201cI am not plastic\u201d tag, but they could be plastic.\u201d\n\nSo, how does a consumer differentiate the biodegradable and plastic bag? Where plastic bags burn with a smell and leave strong fumes, biodegradable bags burn leaving only ash behind without any toxins. Also, biodegradable bags made from corn starch and tapioca will dissolve in lukewarm water, and plastic bags will not. Also, these bags will decompose within 3-6 months depending on the soil.\n\nFor Singhal, there is one challenge when it comes to replacing plastic in her business. \u201cI have phased out plastic completely in my business. I have one challenge though. For packing hot liquids, I use a pouch that does contain some plastic. And if there is an alternative, I will switch. I have not found any alternative to that. I have not used plastic boxes for packing as that will keep accumulating and create a larger problem and is not cost-effective as well.\u201d\n\nThe concept of biodegradable bags have been there for more than a decade and a half in developed nations, according to Cibhi. And, here in Coimbatore, all they did was formulate their own composition using local resources like tapioca starch. \u201cFinding raw materials for making bags was also not a challenge,\u201d he says.\n\nHe adds, \u201cEven if there was no ban, and when there is awareness among people, this could be made cost-effective. Many people are aware that we have to change. The only part that is holding up people from completely changing is the cost. When the demand increases, suppliers will give discounts, production will increase and this could reduce the price. At the end of the day, it affects everyone -whether it goes to landfills, or on the road, it is harmful, all of us are being affected, people are not looking at that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to question ourselves on what we can do as individuals. As long as you are ready, everything is fine,\u201d says Singhal.", "description": "Right in the midst of the bustling bus stands in Coimbatore is a green machine that says plastic bottle vending machine.
