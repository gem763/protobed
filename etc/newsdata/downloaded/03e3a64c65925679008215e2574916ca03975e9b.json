Indeed, some have suggested that younger generations are more accepting of people with mental-health conditions, more inclined to try therapy and more willing to discuss mental health openly \u2014 perhaps making them more aware of the issue.\n\nThe share of adolescents and young adults experiencing serious psychological distress, major depression or suicidal thoughts has seen a significant increase over the past decade, according to separate American Psychological Association research published in March. Among adults 26 and over, those trends were \u201cweak or non-existent,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, who suggested digital media use and poor sleep among younger people could be factors.\n\nMeanwhile, young people have grown increasingly likely to seek treatment for mental health: For example, utilization of college counseling centers rose by 30% to 40% on average between fall 2009 and spring 2015, even as enrollment inched up just 5%, according to a 2018 report by Penn State University\u2019s Center for Collegiate Mental Health.\n\nThe present study\u2019s findings demonstrate that the experience and impact of mental-health problems can vary by demographic group, the report\u2019s authors wrote, including racial and ethnic groups, gender, age, sexual orientation, and parents versus non-parents. \u201cThe experience of mental health at work is not uniform,\u201d they wrote, citing the experiences of some LGBTQ, black and Hispanic respondents.\n\nStill, there was no significant difference across seniority levels in the symptoms reported, the survey found.\n\nThe authors, pointing to their finding that nearly six in 10 respondents had experienced at least one mental-health symptom in the past year, suggested that government estimates do not capture the full scope of the problem. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimated in 2015 that about one in five American adults (or 43.4 million people) had experienced mental illness within the previous year.\n\nOrganizations can hang on to their talent by paying more attention to mental-health issues, the report suggested \u2014 particularly those impacting minority employees.\n\n\u201cEmployees feel unequipped and unsupported at work and, thus, don\u2019t get help,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cOur findings highlight the need for greater leadership support for mental health, company-wide awareness and training, and workplace policies and practices that are consistent with this message.\u201d\n\nJust 41% of respondents to the Mind Share Partners survey thought their company prioritized mental health relative to other concerns, and 39% said their manager would be well-equipped to help in the event of their having a mental-health condition.\n\nThe report also shed light on the continued stigma surrounding mental health in the workplace: Less than one-third of respondents said they felt comfortable seeking support, even though about twice as many said they felt comfortable providing such support to coworkers.\n\nNearly six in 10 respondents said they\u2019d \u201cnever\u201d spoken with colleagues about their mental health over the past year, with baby boomers and Generation Xers far more likely than their younger counterparts to report not discussing it. Just 48% of those who had a workplace conversation about their mental health deemed it a positive experience, while 30% said it was \u201cneutral,\u201d 15% said it was negative and 3% said they didn\u2019t receive any response.", "description": "The finding signals a \u2018generational shift in awareness,\u2019 say the authors of a new report.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT070_mental_ZG_20191010123212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
