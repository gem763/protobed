REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam should step down following months of protests against her government, Malaysian media reported.\n\nGrowing opposition to the Hong Kong government has plunged the financial hub into its biggest political crisis in decades and poses the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in Kuala Lumpur, Mahathir, referring to Beijing, said Lam \u201chas to obey the masters and at the same time she has to ask her conscience\u201d, according to online news portal MalaysiaKini.\n\n\u201cI think best thing is to resign,\u201d Mahathir said.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong began over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, and have intensified markedly since June. They have also evolved into wider calls for democracy, among other demands.\n\nMahathir, 94, is one of Asia\u2019s most experienced leaders. He was prime minister for 22 years from 1981, only to come out of retirement last year to head a government after an opposition election victory.", "description": "Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam should step down following months of protests against her government, Malaysian media reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436936047&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930G8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
