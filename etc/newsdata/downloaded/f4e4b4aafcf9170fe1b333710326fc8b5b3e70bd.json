The flaw in reading levels.", "language": "en", "text": "But there are some catches. As longtime teachers, we have seen how students \u2014 who are tested and assigned a level \u2014 internalize those categories. Students have told us, \u201cI am a G reader\u201d (an example of another reading-level system). Then they share how it makes them feel to be a \u201cG reader\u201d when their peers are \u201cJ readers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQuantifiable measurements give students, teachers and administrators the confidence and assurance of \u201cprogress\u201d: There is a sense of comfort in advancing from one designated level to the next. But reading is not a science. When we place significant value on quantifiable measures, we also might be pushing readers away from an intrinsic love of reading \u2014 and ignoring the great complexity of literature that is simply immeasurable.\n\nThis brings us to the reading-level systems themselves. The numbers or letters \u2014 which often affect how books are shelved in classrooms, libraries and bookstores \u2014 don\u2019t take into account qualitative factors such as vocabulary, story structure, maturity of theme or a child\u2019s developmental readiness.\n\nThe Lexile Educator Guide offers a chart of the \u201ctypical reader measures by grade\u201d to \u201cconnect students with \u2018just right\u2019 reading.\u201d Their infographic features a boy carrying books with Lexile levels labeled on the spines. The boy\u2019s quote bubble reads, \u201cMy Lexile measure is 1240L. That makes my Lexile range, or reading comprehension \u2018sweet spot,\u2019 1140L to 1290L.\u201d Books outside of his \u201crange\u201d rest by themselves on a library cart.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo demonstrate how the Lexile measure in particular miscalculates books, we took a deep look into its number system. Below, we list the Lexile levels in parentheses for some commonly read books. ( AD stands for adult directed. NC is for nonconforming, meaning they have a Lexile measure markedly higher than the publisher\u2019s intended audience.) Next to each level, we match the book\u2019s Lexile level with the Lexile Educator Guide\u2019s typical grade range:\n\n\u25cf \u201cNight,\u201d by Elie Wiesel (590): 3rd grade\n\n\u25cf \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d by Ernest Hemingway (610): 3rd grade\n\n\u25cf \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u201d by John Steinbeck (680): 3rd-4th grade\n\n\u25cf \u201cThe Power and the Glory,\u201d by Graham Greene (710): 3rd-4th grade\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf \u201cCat\u2019s Cradle,\u201d by Kurt Vonnegut (790): 4th-5th grade\n\n\u25cf \u201cThe Sound and the Fury,\u201d by William Faulkner (800): 4th-5th grade\n\n\u25cf \u201cExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close,\u201d by Jonathan Safran Foer (800): 4th-5th grade\n\n\u25cf \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d by Harper Lee (870): 4th-6th grade\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf \u201cInvisible Man, by Ralph Ellison (870): 4th-6th grade\n\n\u25cf \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d by Ray Bradbury (890): 4th-6th grade\n\n\u25cf \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid (Book One),\u201d by Jeff Kinney (950 ): 5th-9th grade\n\n\u25cf \u201cTender is the Night,\u201d by F.

The Common Core says that there are exceptions within reading-level systems, and MetaMetrics has made some adjustments to its numbers in the past couple of years. But we find these exceptions \u2014 as exemplified by these titles \u2014 to be insurmountable. They demonstrate the fundamental flaw in reducing books to algorithms and creating reading levels based on them.\n\nAD\n\nChildren should never be told that they cannot read certain books because they are not in their Lexile level or other comparable measure. We should respect students as readers and act, instead, as facilitators of reading and learning. Kids should read about topics that interest them and pique their curiosities rather than texts that fit within number-crunched factors.\n\nAD\n\nAs Teri Lesesne writes in her book \u201cReading Ladders\u201d: \u201cReading levels and Lexiles are not the way to determine the rigor of a text. Instead, rigor should be determined by sophistication of thought, depth of character development, stylistic choices, and mastery of language on the part of the author.\u201d\n\nThe key to knowing how to teach and challenge our students and children is to read, read, read. This allows us to make recommendations when readers finish books. When we visit stores and libraries, we ask children to select books based on interest. Then, we open the books and read the first pages together. (This can also be done online by opening up the preview pages of books.) Next, we ask the child if the book feels too difficult to the point that it\u2019s very frustrating. If yes, we try another book.\n\nAD\n\nWe want to challenge our children, but we also don\u2019t want books to frustrate them to the point that it makes them dislike reading. We trust readers to make that decision for themselves \u2014 and with our support, if they need it. If a book is too easy for a child, we should ask ourselves, \u201cWill it be harmful if the child reads the book?\u201d For us, the answer is always no. If we flood children with books of all levels and instill a love of reading, then they will read some books above and below their ascribed reading level. They will be reading with interest, with passion \u2014 and with love.\n\nAD\n\nRicki Ginsberg is an assistant professor of English education at Colorado State University.
