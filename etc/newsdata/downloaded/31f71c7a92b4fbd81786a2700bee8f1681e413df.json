Originally aspiring to be an opera singer, he taught himself piano on the side and was soon performing with two of his classmates at the High School of Music and Art, bassist Eddie Gomez and drummer Al Foster.\n\nAD\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Ginger Baker, the prodigiously talented and volcanically temperamental rock drummer who helped form Cream, rock-and-roll\u2019s first supergroup, and inspired awe and imitation in a generation of drummers, died Oct. 6 at 80. Read the obituary (Mj Kim/AP)\n\nAD\n\nMr. Willis was offered athletic scholarships as a basketball player but ultimately went to the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied music theory and voice. He later told friends that as his leanings toward jazz were increasing \u2014 he was playing at clubs in Harlem \u2014 the school did not feature courses in the subject. He said he was asked to leave a practice area for trying to pull together a jam session.\n\n\u201cHaving never played piano before, he taught himself piano at 16 and, within three years without having taken any piano lessons, joined the band of Jackie McLean, the leading alto player in the generation after Charlie Parker,\u201d said Sprey, who hired Mr. Willis as musical director of Mapleshade Records.\n\nMcLean caught a performance by the 19-year-old Mr. Willis, who wrote two selections for and played on McLean\u2019s 1965 album \u201cRight Now!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Willis also went on a tour with Masekela, a South African trumpeter who was one of his classmates at the Manhattan School of Music, then joined Blood, Sweat & Tears in 1972.\n\n\u201cHe played for Blood, Sweat & Tears for five years and, particularly in live performances, laid down some of rock\u2019s most intense, innovative electric keyboard solos,\u201d Sprey said.\n\nMr. Willis moved to Upper Marlboro, Md., in the 1990s. He became music director of Mapleshade Records and toured internationally with a \u201chectic, but enjoyable\u201d schedule, he told the Sun.\n\n\u201cHe was popular and had strong followings in Spain, Italy, Israel and Russia,\u201d Sprey said.\n\nMr. Willis moved to Baltimore in 2007 and performed as recently as Aug. 1 at the Keystone Korner, a Baltimore jazz club.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was easy to see that onstage he was an inspiring accompanist for the great musicians he played with,\u201d Sprey said. \u201cNot at all obvious to the jazz public was that he was an equally inspiring and selfless producer in the recording studio. From 1992 to 2007 he produced two-thirds of the albums we recorded at Mapleshade and I was an eyewitness to the dozens of recording sessions he transformed, just with a quiet word here and there, from near-disaster to joyously swinging triumphs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Willis received Benny Golson Jazz Master Award from Howard University in 2012.\n\nHe was married several times, but a complete list of survivors could not be confirmed.\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nGinger Baker, rock drumming colossus of Cream, dies at 80\n\nEric Pleskow, Jewish refugee who led two movie studios, dies at 95\n\nMary Abbott, abstract expressionist with an unsung influence, dies at 98\n\nAD", "description": "He was nominated for three Grammys and accompanied Dizzy Gillespie and Hugh Masekela.", "authors": ["Jacques Kelly"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oteYinStLcsKr2PtkQ819HFyDVA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3TWWFFHII4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
