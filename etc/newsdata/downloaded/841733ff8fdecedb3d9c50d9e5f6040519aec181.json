He accused her of working for the DNC.", "language": "en", "text": "Nancy Amons, a longtime investigative reporter at Nashville\u2019s WSMV, had just seven minutes to interview Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while he was in town Friday to speak to a group about religious freedom. So Amons didn\u2019t waste any time, telling the secretary that she was going to \u201cstart right away with the tough stuff.\u201d\n\nThen, in an exchange that has been hailed as \u201cgutsy,\u201d \u201crelentless\u201d and \u201ca master class in journalism,\u201d Amons pressed Pompeo on the latest news in the Trump-Ukraine scandal. She questioned him about the resignation of one of his senior advisers and the ouster of a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. She asked three times whether he met with Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani while in Warsaw, and he refused to say.\n\nUndeterred, Amons inquired about text messages showing that U.S. diplomats believed a relationship between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president was contingent upon the country investigating his political rivals. That\u2019s when Pompeo lost his cool.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got your facts wrong,\u201d he told Amons, shaking his head. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re working, at least in part, for the Democratic National Committee.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s envoy to testify that \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 came from Trump]\n\nPompeo was in Nashville to speak at a conference held by the American Association of Christian Counselors. As Marie Yovanovitch, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified before Congress that she was ousted because of pressure from Trump, the secretary of state joked to the group that it was \u201ca heck of a day not to be in Washington.\u201d\n\nWhile in Tennessee, Pompeo sat for interviews with local reporters. Among them was Amons. A 30-year veteran of WSMV, she has produced investigations that led to federal indictments and state inquiries, and told The Washington Post that she \u201ccan\u2019t think of anything else I would want to do, unless it was being a private investigator.\u201d\n\nSome speculated that Pompeo was expecting easy questions when he sat down with her. Amons thinks that\u2019s likely.\n\nCabinet secretaries in every administration usually enjoy or tolerate these local TV interviews because they assume they\u2019ll be tossed puffball questions compared to network correspondents. Doesn\u2019t always work out like that as @SecPompeo today realized in #Tennessee. https://t.co/9dx4WYVTQo \u2014 Steve Herman (@W7VOA) October 11, 2019\n\nPompeo was definitely not expecting 98-mph fastballs from \u2066@WSMVNancyAmons\u2069 https://t.co/MZGWvsXmO8 \u2014 John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) October 12, 2019\n\n\u201cPeople do underestimate me a lot because I\u2019m five feet tall and I walk in and I\u2019m this little short blonde,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope to be friendly and polite, and then they don\u2019t see the questions coming, I guess.\u201d\n\nThe conversation between Amons and Pompeo began amicably, as she joked that he had probably done a few thousand interviews and could clip on his own microphone. She opened the interview by welcoming him to Nashville; he smiled while telling her it was good to be there.\n\nThen Amons was ready to move on from the pleasantries. Holding a stack of notes, she launched into a line of questioning about the resignation of senior Pompeo adviser Michael McKinley.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s adding his voice to a number of career diplomats who\u2019ve expressed frustration over what they see as your failure to stand up for government servants \u2014 for servants like Ambassador Yovanovitch who have been caught up in the Ukraine controversy,\u201d Amons said. \u201cDid you do enough to defend the ambassador, privately and publicly, against the smear campaign that was being waged against her, and will you speak to that now?\"\n\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, you have some of your facts wrong, so you should be careful about things you assert as facts before you state them,\u201d Pompeo responded. \u201cBut more importantly, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work that I\u2019ve done along with my team, other senior leaders at the State Department, to make sure that this institution was functional, preserved and delivering on behalf of America.\u201d\n\nMoments later, when Amons pointed out that he and Giuliani were in Warsaw at the same time, and asked whether they met, Pompeo said, \u201cI don\u2019t talk about who I meet with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went to Warsaw for a particular purpose,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was an important mission. We brought together people all across the world to take down the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror, the Islamic Republic of Iran. That\u2019s what I worked on on that mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to say whether you met with him?\u201d Amons asked, still determined to get an answer.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in Warsaw, I had a singular focus,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cMy focus was singularly on the work that we have done, effective work, to recover from what the Obama administration has done, which is to underwrite the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror. We\u2019ve stopped that, and we\u2019re making real progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re not going to say,\u201d Amons said.\n\nPompeo repeated the same line: \u201cWhen I was in Warsaw, we were working diligently to accomplish the mission to take down the terror regime that\u2019s inside the Islamic Republic of Iran. That\u2019s what I worked on. It was the only thing that I engaged in while I was there.\u201d\n\n[Hunter Biden will step down from board of Chinese firm, his attorney says]\n\nAt that point, Amons asked about the text messages of the U.S. diplomats, and Pompeo made the jab that she worked for the DNC. He told her that her phrasing \u201cdoes a real disservice to the employees and the team at the United States Department of State.\u201d Then he said that the United States has important foreign policy interests in Ukraine, adding that the \"threat from Russia is real and this administration, unlike the previous one, is taking those responsibilities very seriously.\u201d\n\nAmons wrapped up the interview by giving Pompeo a chance to talk about the reason he came to Nashville. Then she told him that she was out of time. He thanked her and quickly left \u2014 this time without the banter that had started the meeting. \u201cI think he liked me less at the end,\u201d Amons wrote on Twitter.\n\nAs she walked out of the interview, she said she felt as though she had gotten \u201ca whole lot of nothing\u201d and wondered what she would even report from it. Then she decided that Pompeo\u2019s refusal to answer questions was the story. She was surprised by the reaction to her questions. Still, she didn\u2019t think his DNC comments merited a response.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to defend a personal attack,\u201d Amons said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t worth the time. I had seven minutes. I had other questions I wanted to ask.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nLawyer John Dowd responded to impeachment probe in Comic Sans.
