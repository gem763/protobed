In July, the babies start leaving their cosy confines to join the nightly swarm in search of food.\n\nCan I visit it?\n\nThe nightly departure from the cave is a spectacle so astonighing it must be seen to be believed, and many tourists are eager to do so.\n\nWhile access to the cave and its immediate surroundings is restricted, the BCT runs tours which allow visitors to watch from afar as the they spiral into the dusk, a process that can take up to four hours, such is their number.\n\nBracken Cave is home to an estimated 20 million bats Credit: GETTY\n\nWhy farmers love them\n\nInsects are the crop farmer's worst enemy, costing them a fortune in damaged harvest on a routine basis. And what do bats eat? Insects. Lots of them.\n\nThe bats of Bracken Cave chomp their way through several tons of bugs each night as they cross paths with critters including the cotton bollworth moth.\n\nThese bats save cotton farmers in south central Texas a whopping $740,000 (\u00a3561,000) a year, according to the BCT.\n\nThe bats roosting inside the cave Credit: GETTY\n\nBut pilots aren't so keen\n\nThe Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, a training facility for the US Airforce, is located just 11 miles from Bracken Cave, meaning something of an airspace battle between man and beast.\n\nIn 2013, the base reported six bat strikes during flights, according to Air Education and Training Command's Flight Safety Division.\n\nIt's been all quiet since then, however, so presumably training sessions are simply avoided between the hours of 6pm-8pm, when the bats are on the move.\n\nThe urban colony in Austin\n\nAround 70 miles north of Bracken Cave, in the Texan city of Austin, lives another, smaller colony of Mexican free-tailed bats. Smaller, but not small. Here, they number about 1.5 million, making them the largest urban bat colony in North America.\n\nThese city-dwelling fellows found their home under the Congress Avenue Bridge when it was built in 1980, much to the alarm of Austin natives at the time. These days, however, they're a huge tourist attraction.\n\nTourists gather at Austin's Congress Avenue Bridge to watch the urban bat colony each night Credit: Getty\n\nHundreds of visitors and locals alike gather on a viewing platform adjacent to the bridge during summer evenings to witness them soar off into the night.\n\nThe BCT estimate that more than 100,000 people attend the spectacle each year, generating $10million (\u00a37.6million) in tourism revenue annually.\n\nYou can find out more about visiting the colonies at Bracken Cave and Congress Avenue Bridge here. And if you thought you were afraid of bats, a quick lesson in their fascinating nature - and their key role in the planet's food chain - might just change your mind.", "description": "", "authors": ["Annabel Fenwick Elliott", "Senior Content Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/galleries/travel/destinations/northamerica/usa/TexasBatCave/Bracken%2520Cave%2520Cover-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2017-10-30"}
