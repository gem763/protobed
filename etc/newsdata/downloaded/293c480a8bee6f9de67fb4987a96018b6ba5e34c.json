She was fired weeks after the killing.\n\nThe jury, which reportedly deliberated for less than two days before making its decision, was allowed to review the \"Castle Doctrine,\" a law that allows defendants to protect themselves in their own homes through the use of deadly force when necessary.\n\nMs Guyger was seen sobbing during her testimony, the first time she spoke about the shooting since Mr Jean\u2019s death garnered national media attention and outcry. Mr Jean's death prompted mass protests nationwide, as activists demanded justice for the killing of an unarmed black man in his own home.\n\nAt one point she said behind tears: \u201cI hate that I have to live with this every single day of my life and I ask God for forgiveness, and I hate myself every single day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never wanted to take an innocent person\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so sorry. This is not about hate. It\u2019s about being scared that night.\u201d\n\nMore follows\u2026\n\n\n\n", "description": "A jury has found a former police officer guilty of murder for the death of Botham Jean, who was shot and killed inside of his apartment in September 2018.Amber Guyger, a former Dallas officer, had argued in her murder trial that she mistook Mr Jean's residence for her own apartment when she walked", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NPUSG54ucgNgqSDZ2JhalQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/c044bfd9ca7a40f29d4202379e3a610e"}
