The mayor called the U.S. president the \u201cglobal poster boy for white nationalism\u201d in an Observer article, and Trump has called him a \u201cstone-cold loser.\u201d\n\nTrump canceled his planned trip to Poland at the last minute on Thursday to be ready to direct the federal response to Hurricane Dorian, he said. But he spent hours at one of his golf courses on Saturday \u2014 and again on Monday.\n\nThe president gave the impression when he left the White House on Friday for Labor Day weekend that he would be hunkered down at Camp David for the duration of the hurricane. But reporters caught Trump flying back and forth by helicopter from the presidential retreat in Maryland to his links at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. The president arrived at the Virginia course at 10:10 on Monday morning and left at 2:15, according to press pool reports.\n\nThe White House has been cagey about Trump\u2019s exact use of his time over the holiday weekend. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham insisted that Trump received Dorian updates \u201cevery hour.\u201d\n\nHe excoriated his predecessor for golfing then skipped out on Poland\u2019s World War Two commemoration and US oversight of the deadly #Dorian hurricane to *checks notes* go golfing at his own property.\n\nTell me again how this makes America great ... pic.twitter.com/adW6M1BpKz \u2014 Christine Pelosi (@sfpelosi) September 2, 2019\n\nAs his motorcade left the golf club, chanting protesters outside waved signs saying \u201cImpeach,\u201d \u201cJail Trump,\u201d \u201cStop the Donald\u201d and \u201crat-infested Trump family reunion,\u201d according to a pool report.\n\nCritics have suggested Trump is more worried about Hurricane Dorian as it approaches Florida because it could threaten his Mar-a-Lago property. He repeatedly grilled officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency at a briefing on Sunday about the predicted storm path in Florida, where his resort is located.\n\nThat\u2019s when Trump also said he didn\u2019t know if he had \u201cever even heard of a Category 5 hurricane,\u201d which Dorian was at the time. Yet hurricanes Irma, Maria and Michael were all Category 5 hurricanes that occurred during his presidency.\n\nMeanwhile, deadly Dorian was expected to continue to create havoc over the Bahamas before barreling toward Florida\u2019s east coast. At least five people have been killed in the now Category 4 storm.\n\nFirst death recorded in Abaco following Hurrican Dorian passage on Abaco....\n\n\n\nBP BREAKING| The first recorded death of Hurricane Dorian is now being confirmed. Seven year-old, Lachino Mcintosh, drowned after his family attempts to relocate their home.

Polish President Andrzej Duda criticized foreign leaders at a ceremony on Sunday for being too soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin in the wake of Moscow\u2019s aggression in Georgia and Ukraine. He indicated that Russia\u2019s \u201cimperialism\u201d smacked of the Nazis\u2019 land grabs.\n\nTrump clashed with world leaders at the G-7 summit last week as he battled to have Russia reinstated as a member of the group of major industrial nations.\n\nDuda spoke out against the idea of a G-7 rapprochement with Russia on Monday, Agence France Presse reported.\n\n\u201cShould we have a business-as-usual approach toward Russia? ... I believe that we cannot under the current circumstances,\u201d Duda told reporters at a joint press conference with visiting Vice President Mike Pence, who had traveled to Poland in Trump\u2019s stead.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jim Acosta reported that while Trump was on the links in Virginia, Pence traveled to Trump\u2019s course in Ireland.\n\nBoth Trump and Pence are at Trump properties at this moment on Labor Day. Trump is at his golf course in VA while Pence is staying at a Trump golf course in Ireland, per pool.
