Some people are.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"2) Boasting about the BGT ratings and popularity when you were briefly on it to someone who has not only transformed the show but is consistently the biggest-selling author in the country didn't work.\"\n\nAs usual, Piers didn't back down.\n\nHe said: \"Hi Matt, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2018polite\u2019 to be friendly to people in person but poisonous behind their back - it\u2019s cowardly.\n\n\"As for BGT, I was very proudly on it for the first 4 years when ratings topped 20 million. They\u2019re now half that. Not a boast, just a fact.\"\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nAnd having clearly had enough, Matt, who starred with David on a number of hit shows including Little Britain, simply said: \"Go to bed\"\n\nThe public were left divided by the spat, with some siding with David and Matt and some siding with Piers.\n\nOne said: \"Grown ups have the ability to be civil to people\u2019s faces even if they don\u2019t like them, Piers. Perhaps you could learn a lesson from him.\"\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nAnother commented: \"Hard to sympathise with you when every word of the tweet David liked is correct.\"\n\nWhile one wrote: \"Always lovely to see a Children's author using such a vile tone. I don't think my daughter is missing much.\"\n\nAnd another told Piers: \"Wow.. you\u2019re now finding out who your friends really are..\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
