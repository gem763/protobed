Equally, they feel some signings, including Alexis S\u00e1nchez, have simply been unable to cope with the weight of expectation of playing for the club.\n\nUnited believe they have a far more robust recruitment operation now in place and, in Solskjaer, a manager whose outlook is in sync with the club\u2019s three-pillar ethos of wanting to win trophies playing attacking football while giving youth its chance.\n\nNonetheless, United have won just five of his 21 matches since Solskjaer was appointed as permanent manager and their dearth of goals this season has raised serious questions about their decision not to bring in replacements for the departed Romelu Lukaku and S\u00e1nchez.\n\nYet regardless of the pressing need for a striker, it is thought United have little appetite to make what might be considered a panic signing in January. One source suggested it can be \u201cfool\u2019s gold\u201d buying in the winter window. A move for the veteran Juventus striker, Mario Mandzukic, with whom they held talks in the summer, seems unlikely at this stage.\n\nUnited have made their worst start to a season for 30 years but Woodward believes the club have the right man at the helm in Solskjaer, who is said to retain his 100 per cent support. There is also a belief that a series of injuries to key personnel have taken their toll on a thin squad but that a cold-eyed decision to lose a series of experienced players in the summer as part of a so-called \u201ccultural reboot\u201d was the right way to go.\n\n\u201cThe middle section of last season, after Ole\u2019s arrival, feels most relevant to what we want to achieve and where we want to be,\u201d Woodward said.\n\n\u201cWe saw a team playing fast, fluid football, with a clear representation of the style and philosophy the manager wants.\n\n\u201cOle has also instilled the discipline back into an environment where we may have lacked it in recent years. He is building a squad that respects the club\u2019s history, in which players work hard and respect their team-mates. No-one is bigger than the club.\n\n\u201cThe changes we saw over the summer have resulted in a very young squad. But it\u2019s also a squad, with the players and the culture, that provides a base camp for us to build and grow from as we start our new journey.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, academy graduate Brandon Williams has signed a new contract to June 2022, with the option of another year.", "description": "Ed Woodward has launched a robust defence of his running of Manchester United and insisted it is \u201cinsulting\u201d to suggest the club\u2019s commercial arm takes priority over the football operation.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000194816566-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGiNaGowEdQUVD5ODTfqOV3SB4QVlyD9DMPvzXIp3DQg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
