Here is a few ideas:\n\n1. India:\n\nIndia is looking to be the primary export partner for the T-14 Armata, with the Armata fulfilling the requirements for India\u2019s FRCV open contract.\n\nOther tanks that could compete against the Armata within the FRCV contract requirements are the Korean K2 Black Panther and Ukrainian BM Oplot. Most current Western tanks like the Leopard 2A7 and M1A2 Abrams are too heavy for Indian terrain.\n\nThe Armata also faces domestic opposition in the Arjun Mk. 2, but it\u2019s unsure if the latest version of the Arjun can overcome the poor reputation and controversies of its predecessor.\n\n2. China:\n\nDespite its own burgeoning arms industry, China continues to acquire advanced Russian military equipment such as the Su-35S and the S-400.\n\nIn doing so, it\u2019s continuing a relationship that began in the 1990s in which China buys expensive and close to cutting edge equipment from Russia then incorporates its features into its own products, as it has done with the J-11B and HQ-9.\n\nAs such, China will likely try to buy Armatas, if only in limited numbers to evaluate them, adopt what technology they think is good, and perhaps produce their competing version of the Armata for export.\n\n3.
