So, former Cowboy great Michael Irvin has an idea to fix this mess: Sign controversial wide receiver Antonio Brown.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any trade out there now that will get us over the top,\u201d Irvin said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas on Wednesday. \u201cAmari, he\u2019ll get back, unless you want to go pick up Antonio Brown until [Cooper] gets back. What are your guys thoughts on that?\u201d\n\nHosts Shan Shariff and R.J. Choppy both shot down the idea of signing Brown, currently a free agent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, desperation makes you start thinking about a lot of things,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cWe ain\u2019t got no time to be sitting here riding the high horse like we too good for this and we too good for that. We need some H-E-L-P right now, some real help.\u201d\n\nBut even if the Cowboys wanted to sign Brown, the NFL might not allow it.\n\nOn September 20, Brown was released by the New England Patriots after the receiver was accused of sending intimidating text messages to a woman alleging sexual misconduct by the player. Brown has also been accused of rape by another woman.\n\nThe NFL is reviewing both matters. So, until the NFL concludes their investigation, it\u2019s unclear if teams can even sign the player.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working at that,\u201d NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said at a Wednesday league meeting in Fort Lauderdale. \u201cI will probably be getting an update when I get back to New York. Our folks have been working diligently at that. When we reach a conclusion, I\u2019ll obviously let you know.\u201d\n\nBut Irvin feels desperate times call for desperate measures.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care where we find help, I don\u2019t care what kind of media relations coming with it or public relations nightmare come with it,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cWins can cure some of those things.\u201d\n\nWhile Dallas\u2019 passing game wasn\u2019t great last week in their loss to the New York Jets, part of that problem might not have been related to the receiver position. Dallas played that game without both their injured starting offensive tackles \u2013 left tackle Tyron Smith and right tackle Lael Collins \u2013 perhaps the best tandem in football. Having your bookend offensive tackles out, especially two players of this magnitude, would be tough for most offensives to overcome. Both players are expected back very soon and the team\u2019s brass believes that this will help their offensive immeasurable.\n\nCooper is also expected back soon from a leg injury not considered a long-term malady.\n\nBut Irvin is very concerned with Cooper\u2019s potential absence for the Cowboys\u2019 next game, a division match-up against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\u201cWhere we\u2019re hurting right now, we\u2019re hurting in the worse places, in the worse places, and you see it,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cAny good coach is going to be able to attack our weaknesses. First of all, Philly had no answer for Amari Cooper last year, and now Amari Cooper is likely not going to be playing.\u201d\n\nAnd Antonio Brown isn\u2019t likely to play for Dallas either, especially with a league investigation going on.", "description": "The Dallas Cowboys have lost three games in a row, and their star receiver Amari Cooper is injured.
