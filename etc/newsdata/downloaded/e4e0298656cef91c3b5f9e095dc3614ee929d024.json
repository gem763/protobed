He was in major shock.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\n\"We got the call and it just floored us. We had Riley with us and it is very very hard to deal with.\"\n\nThe family have not told the young boy that his mum is dead.\n\n\"He has no idea what has happened, thank god,\" Lesley said.\n\n\"He is an angel and absolute dream to look after. That's credit to Jordan who was a brilliant mum.\"\n\nEx-Royal Marine Nathan has worked as a fireman for around 12 years and reassured Jordan's parents she would not have felt pain before her death.\n\nThe crash happened in near Barnsley, South Yorkshire shortly after 5am on October 19.\n\nJordan was a bridesmaid at her mum Kat's wedding to step-dad Scott last month.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\nKat, 39, said her daughter was \"absolutely hilarious\" and someone who doted on her family - especially her son.\n\nShe said: \"She was very, very open and had no filter. Jordan was stunning and she loved her little boy.\"\n\nScott, also 39, was close to Jordan and fondly described her as \"an absolute nutter\".\n\nHe added: \"She really did love life and she really lived it.\"\n\nNan Lesley has set up a fundraising page for Jordan's son.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\nShe said the response to the page has been \"absolutely overwhelming\" and said she could not thank people enough.\n\nLesley and her husband Ian, 68, are currently taking care of Riley.\n\nJordan leaves behind three siblings - Katie, 16, Liam, 11 and Maddison, five.\n\nHer dad, Ryan Zuppinger, used to work in the Army, meaning Jordan spent her early life with him in Cyprus, Germany and Edinburgh, before settling back in Barnsley.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\nA spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said: \"The passenger of the Clio, an 18-year-old woman, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n\"Her family are being supported by specially trained officers.\n\n\"The Clio was believed to have been travelling behind a white Citroen C1.\n\n\"Officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision, who may have seen the driving manner of either vehicle prior to the collision, or who may have any information that can help with our enquiries.\"", "description": "Nathan Williams attended a fatal crash near Barnsley in South Yorkshire to discover niece Jordan Williams was in the vehicle", "authors": ["Liam Mcinerney", "Image", "Triangle News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748141.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Firefighter_Nathan_Williams_2_TRIANGLENEWS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
