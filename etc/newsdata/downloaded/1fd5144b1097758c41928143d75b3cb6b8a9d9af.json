But in a Vogue interview published on Wednesday, the 31-year-old Barbados native didn\u2019t hold back when discussing President Donald Trump and his \u201cracist\u201d response to the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nRihanna stars on the November 2019 cover of Vogue, where she opens up about her fears as an immigrant. (Photo: Vogue) More\n\n\u201cPeople are being murdered by war weapons that they legally purchase. This is just not normal. That should never, ever be normal. And the fact that it\u2019s classified as something different because of the color of their skin? It\u2019s a slap in the face. It\u2019s completely racist,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s response to the El Paso shooting in particular, which included him calling it an \u201cact of cowardice\u201d and a problem with mental illness. \u201cPut an Arab man with that same weapon in that same Walmart and there is no way that Trump would sit there and address it publicly as a mental health problem. The most mentally ill human being in America right now seems to be the president.\u201d\n\nThe issue is near and dear to Rihanna, who moved to the United States from the Caribbean in 2005. She called out the president on Instagram in June, and on the Fourth of July, she stepped out in a shirt that read \u201cIMMIGRANT.\u201d\n\nShe even condemned statements made on CNN by the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, who said that the people referenced in Emma Lazarus' poem, etched on the Statue of Liberty, refers to \u201cpeople coming from Europe,\u201d specifically.\n\n\u201cThe fact that his defense was talking about Europeans coming into America?\u201d Rihanna told Vogue. \u201cI mean, not only were you immigrants, you were the worst kind. You came in and murdered the real Americans.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she had words of encouragement for young immigrants, she didn\u2019t hold back.\n\nRelated Video: Everything to Know About \u2018The Rihanna Book\u2019\n\n\u201cI almost feel sick to my stomach. I don\u2019t even believe this is happening in real life,\u201d Rihanna said. \u201cIn front of my eyes. In front of the world. It\u2019s not even hidden. This is blatant.\u201d\n\nEven though she\u2019s been living in London, Rihanna says that she hasn\u2019t felt distant from the issues facing minorities in the U.S. She specifically cited her responsibility to turn down the opportunity to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t dare do that,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, Rihanna is able to identify some hope through everything that\u2019s troubling her.\n\n\u201cI feel like the darkness has actually forced people to find this light within them where they want to do better,\u201d she said. \u201cTo see it, to know it\u2019s happening\u2014it pushes you to want to be the light in the world.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Rihanna opens up about politics in the latest issue of Vogue, condemning President Donald Trump's dealings with immigration and mass shootings.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1K6xcI6hcRQ2ndvJ8NHPDQ--~B/aD0xMzQ5O3c9MTA4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/b61b8a80-eab1-11e9-bff3-c3f90b91e356", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
