Vance Jr. filed lawsuits against Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, according to The Hill.\n\nThe Trump administration challenged Mr. Vance\u2019s subpoena in late August as unconstitutional and politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThe subpoena is a bad faith effort to harass the president by obtaining and exposing his confidential personal information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office disagreed by saying the law doesn\u2019t provide immunity just because Mr. Trump is currently serving as president.\n\nMr. Marrero also gave the Department of Justice until Monday to decide whether they will weigh in on the case.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest bid by the president to prevent prosecutors or congressional oversight panels from acquiring his tax documents. Mr. Trump bucked a decades-long tradition of presidential candidates releasing their tax returns to the public while on the campaign trail.\n\nMr. Vance is probing whether the Trump Organization falsified records related to the hush payments, which were facilitated by Mr. Trump\u2019s fixer, Michael Cohen. The payments were made ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u2022 Alex Swoyer and Jeff Mordock contributed to this article.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
