At the very end this is a British responsibility,\" he said.\n\n\"If they don't want to make any move or make something which is not accepted, they will have to take the responsibility,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron says he doesn't understand why France's pick for the European Commission, Sylvie Goulard, was rejected by the European Parliament.\n\nMore: France's Sylvie Goulard rejected by members of European parliament\n\nGoulard, who was France's choice to be the next head of European Union industrial policy, was the victim of a \"political game\", the French president's office said shortly after her rejection was announced on Thursday.\n\n\"I don't understand, I need to understand what happened,\" he said.", "description": "The French president warned Turkey is putting millions of people at humanitarian risk with its military campaign against Kurdish forces in northern Syria.", "authors": ["Cristina Abellan Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/26/00/1000x563_cmsv2_498bcd4d-f993-50b0-b71c-90cb6ead0555-4222600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
