The technology sector rose 1.4%.\n\nChipmakers with a sizable exposure to China also gained, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index up about 2%.\n\nChina was still open to agreeing to a partial trade deal with the United States, despite the inclusion of top Chinese artificial intelligence startups in a trade blacklist, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nSeparately, the Financial Times said Beijing was offering to increase its annual purchases of U.S. agricultural products.\n\n\u201cInvestors are hoping for an interim deal, they aren\u2019t expecting anything big, but are cautiously optimistic,\u201d said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group.\n\nTrade tensions, efforts to impeach President Donald Trump and signs of slowing economic growth have taken a toll on equity markets in October, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes off about 2% since the end of September.\n\nRising geopolitical risks have also not offered investors any respite. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday a military operation targeting Kurdish fighters in northeast Syrian had begun.\n\nA sharp contraction in U.S. manufacturing data, as well as a dismal reading on business activity last week has raised bets of a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell flagged openness to further rate cuts on Tuesday.
