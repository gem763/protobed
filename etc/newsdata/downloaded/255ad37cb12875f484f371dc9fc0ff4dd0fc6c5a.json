We just let it do its thing and made sure we kept the windows up.\n\n\"It was a free car wash, just wait your turn.\"\n\nThe dirtier the car, the more time it spent. We were just a giant mobile salt lick. - Rick Schuh\n\nSchuh wasn't the only driver treated to a tongue-washing. He thinks the moose had a hankering for the taste of road salt.\n\n\"We noticed that it stopped briefly to lick a Mercedes,\" he said. \"It was a beautiful white Mercedes, nice and clean, and it spent barely any time on that.\n\n\"The dirtier the car, the more time it spent. We were just a giant mobile salt lick.\"\n\nRick Schuh sent in this video of a moose licking the salt from a car in Jasper National Park. 0:42\n\nSchuh, who captured the encounter on video, said it was exciting to come \"eyeball to eyeball\" with a moose but he's concerned about how bold the animal was with humans and vehicles.\n\n\"It was just incredible that our car was able to get that close to a moose and came away unscathed,\" he said.\n\n\"Usually if you're encountering a moose in your car that close, it's not going to end well.\"\n\nMoose are particularly active this time of year. Late September, early October is peak rutting season.\n\nBulls dig rutting pits and fight each other. Cows wallow in pits, feed and get pursued by bulls.\n\nAnd during this particularly hormonal time, moose sightings often spike.\n\nDarcy Hollingsworth sent in this video of a moose, near Eckville, Alta., running across the road with plants covering its head. 0:11\n\nDarcy Hollingsworth enjoyed a moose encounter of a different kind on a Saturday afternoon drive through central Alberta.\n\nHollingsworth, a bison farmer from Rocky Mountain House, was driving near the town of Eckville when he spotted an animal a few metres from the road, rummaging about in a canola field.\n\nIt was a moose with what appeared to be an entire shrub ensnared in its antlers.\n\n\"It just caught my eye as something strange out there,\" Hollingsworth said.\n\n\"It looked like a giant mullet. It was a ball of canola, probably three feet by three feet.\"\n\nThe frisky bull crossed the road in front of Hollingsworth's vehicle and leaped a fence, its crown still intact.\n\nHollingsworth figures the bull was donning some camouflage for the upcoming hunting season. His video of the encounter has been viewed more than 4,000 times.\n\n\"It was just our good fortune to come along and get a video of it,\" he said.\n\n\"If it makes people happy and laugh about it, that's great.\"", "description": "Rick Schuh is warning visitors to Jasper National Park to be wary of moose on the road after one of the burly ungulates treated him to an unexpected car wash.", "authors": ["Wallis Snowdon Is A Digital Journalist With Cbc Edmonton.
