We are completely entitled to do that,' a senior Government source said last night.\n\nThe fate of Mr Johnson's deal now lies in the hands of Speaker John Bercow \u2013 who yesterday hinted that he might not allow a meaningful vote on it \u2013 the rebel MPs and other EU leaders, especially French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk has confirmed he has received the extension request from Boris Johnson. He said on Twitter: 'The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react'\n\nThe fate of Mr Johnson's deal now lies in the hands of Speaker John Bercow \u2013 who yesterday hinted that he might not allow a meaningful vote on it \u2013 the rebel MPs and other EU leaders, especially French President Emmanuel Macron (left) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right)\n\nDowning Street is hopeful that other EU leaders will refuse to allow an extension.\n\nOne source said that they put the chances at 'about 50 per cent', adding: 'Macron has been particularly trenchant in private about not wanting to extend, and we hope he could take Merkel with him.'\n\nLast night, the French President's office indeed signalled that they would not back an extension, which officials said was 'in nobody's interest'.\n\nThe Elysee Palace said given that a deal had been negotiated, 'it's now up to the British Parliament to say if it approves or rejects it. There must be a vote on the fundamentals.'\n\nMr Johnson is also steeling himself for an instant legal challenge from pro-Remain groups (pictured, Oliver Letwin) to his three-letter ploy on the grounds that he did not sign the Benn missive\n\nThe expectation is that the EU will delay any decision about an extension until a special summit earmarked for October 28 \u2013 just 72 hours before the planned Brexit date. By then Downing Street hopes to have passed a deal through the Commons.\n\nAfter returning to Downing Street from yesterday's debate, Mr Johnson spent the evening phoning around other EU leaders to talk them through the contents of his third letter.\n\n'The request for a delay is not mine,' he told them. 'It is Parliament's request, and if you grant it you are granting it to Parliament, not me. I do not want any delay'.\n\nThe PM's plea to fellow leaders echoed his declaration to the Commons yesterday that 'I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so.'\n\nThere were also claims that Mr Johnson had shown to those Tory MPs (pictured, Dominic Grieve and Hilary Benn) he was attempting to win over a text message from Mr Macron, vowing to block any extension\n\nAddressing the first Saturday sitting by MPs since the 1982 Falklands War, Mr Johnson vowed to tell Europe that 'further delay would be bad for this country, bad for the European Union and bad for democracy'.\n\nThere were also claims that Mr Johnson had shown to those Tory MPs he was attempting to win over a text message from Mr Macron, vowing to block any extension.\n\nSuch a hard line from the EU and national leaders would help Mr Johnson continue his narrative that MPs must vote for his deal or risk leaving the bloc without a deal at the end of the month.\n\nHowever, there are further looming showdowns with Parliament that could yet force the EU to grant a further delay.\n\nA major flashpoint this week will be when Government lays down its Withdrawal Agreement Bill in order to enshrine Mr Johnson's deal into law.\n\nWhips fear that a vote on the so-called programme motion \u2013 which sets out the amount of time given to MPs to debate legislation \u2013 will be hijacked by Remainers.\n\nRebels are threatening to attempt to derail the swift timetable drawn up by Downing Street to hit their Halloween deadline.\n\nLast night, a former Downing Street Brexit adviser suggested the Government would urge the EU27 to put off any decision on an extension until this crucial vote has been held on Tuesday.\n\nRaoul Ruparel said if the Government loses control of the programme motion, the 'EU will have to take that into account,' making an extension much more likely as it 'will be clear that a deal can't be ratified' by October 31.\n\nLast night there was also confusion over exactly when the Government would attempt to bring the Withdrawal Bill to the floor of the House after Commons Leader and hardline Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg opened a fresh row with Speaker John Bercow.\n\nMr Rees-Mogg said the parliamentary business on Monday would change to include a debate on a motion on the UK's draft agreement with the EU, which would be followed by a vote.\n\nBut his announcement prompted dismay among Opposition MPs, while a furious Mr Bercow expressed his unhappiness with the situation.\n\nThe Speaker said he was expecting Ministers to bring forward legislation to secure support for their deal, but showed surprise at the plan to table a re-run of yesterday's attempted vote.\n\nHe outlined that he would consider the matter yesterday before making a ruling tomorrow.\n\n'Shame on you': Hate-filled anti-Brexit mob targets Jacob Rees-Mogg's son Peter aged 12 as they yell 'traitor'\n\nAbout 30 campaigners barracked the Leader of the Commons and his son Peter\n\nIt came as they walked from Parliament to the family's \u00a35 million home nearby\n\nDozen police officers formed protective ring around the pair as protesters booed\n\nby Mark Hookham and Brendan Carlin for the Mail on Sunday\n\nA mob of hardline anti-Brexit protesters hounded Jacob Rees-Mogg and his 12-year-old son in the street after yesterday's crunch vote, shouting: 'Shame on you.'\n\nAbout 30 campaigners barracked the Leader of the Commons and his son Peter as they walked from Parliament to the family's \u00a35 million home nearby.\n\nA dozen police officers formed a protective ring around the pair as protesters booed, whistled, swore and yelled 'traitor'.\n\nAbout 30 campaigners barracked the Leader of the Commons and his son Peter (pictured together) as they walked from Parliament to the family's \u00a35 million home nearby\n\nThe officers then lined up across the street near Mr Rees-Mogg's five-storey mansion to prevent activists pursuing him to his front door.\n\nCabinet colleague Michael Gove also had a 12-strong police escort to leave Westminster, while Business Secretary Andrew Leadsom required protection from the 'frightening' mob.\n\nShe later tweeted: 'Why do the so-called People's Vote protesters think it's OK to abuse, intimidate and scream in the face of someone they don't agree with?'\n\nThe ugly scenes came after tens of thousands of Remain supporters marched on Westminster for a mass rally to coincide with the Commons debate.\n\nA dozen police officers formed a protective ring around the pair as protesters booed, whistled, swore and yelled 'traitor'\n\nA centre-piece of the protest was a carnival float carrying a Nazi-style effigy of Boris Johnson's adviser Dominic Cummings.\n\nControlling a 'puppet' Prime Minister, the figure had 'Demonic Cummings' written on the side of its head and wore a brown shirt, an SS-style armband and a Union Jack in place of a 'Hitler' moustache.\n\nThe float was organised by pro-Remain campaign group EU Flag Mafia and designed by controversial German artist Jacques Tilly.\n\nHe has previously designed papier mache figurines of Islamist suicide bombers and one depicting former Prime Minister Theresa May with a 'Brexit' gun in her mouth. Phil Jeanes, of EU Flag Mafia, drove the sculpture to the UK from the German city of Dusseldorf and last night defended the Nazi imagery.\n\nA centre-piece of the protest was a carnival float carrying a Nazi-style effigy of Boris Johnson's adviser Dominic Cummings (pictured)\n\n'We've got a Prime Minister who is a puppet and\u2026 an unelected special adviser who has very strong Right-wing views... So putting him in a brown shirt and Nazi-style armbands brings us back to what was happening in the 1930s in Germany,' said the 67-year-old.\n\nVideos posted online show Mr Rees-Mogg's son Peter appearing to look anxious as protesters barracked his father and police formed a phalanx around them. After the mob was blocked from following any further, one protester was heard declaring: 'Back to the pub.'\n\nMr Rees-Mogg last night mocked the protesters for being 'ruder' than the climate change demonstrators who have brought chaos to parts of London. 'I think the Remainiacs aren't as well-mannered as the Extinction Rebellion people,' he said.\n\nCabinet colleague Michael Gove also had a 12-strong police escort to leave Westminster (pictured), while Business Secretary Andrew Leadsom required protection from the 'frightening' mob\n\n'I was planning to saunter home but my private office said the police wanted to take me back. I thought it was going to be one policeman and it turned out to be a posse.'\n\nHe insisted that his son, who had watched much of the stormy Commons debate from a visitors' gallery, had been 'excited' rather than frightened by the mob.\n\nTory MP Tom Tugendhat said the scenes were a 'sad statement on what we have become'. Security Minister Brandon Lewis tweeted: 'Shocking that anyone feels this is right way to behave and to use police time up. Jacob Rees-Mogg showing real class in his composure.'\n\nMr Rees-Mogg's sister Annunziata, a Brexit Party MEP, said: 'I keep forgetting that the Remoaners are the nice guys.'\n\nA People's Vote spokesman said: 'We don't endorse anybody being followed or barracked by protesters on their way home.'\n\nAsked about the Cummings effigy, the spokesman said he could not comment as he had not seen the float.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott was harangued by a far-Right activist after addressing the rally in Parliament Square.\n\nShe was pursued by Danny Tommo, a friend of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, who shouted: 'The country is so divided, Diane, it's so divided. You have to stop this. It has to stop.'\n\nAlthough organisers claimed a million people marched in London yesterday, the figure is likely to be dramatically inflated.\n\nCampaigners claimed the Brexit referendum march last October attracted 700,000 protesters but expert online analysis put the figure at closer to 82,000.", "description": "The first was the letter demanded by the Benn Act, which asks the EU to delay Brexit beyond the October 31 deadline - but not signed by the PM - using the exact wording specified in the legislation.", "authors": ["Glen Owen Political Editor", "Harry Cole Deputy Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19937194-0-image-a-58_1571518549424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
