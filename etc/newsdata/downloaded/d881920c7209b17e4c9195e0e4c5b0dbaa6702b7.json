Start rewarding him for honesty instead.\n\nJack Shafer is Politico\u2019s senior media writer.\n\nAs Donald Trump approached the 1,000th day of his presidency last week, the Washington Post fact-checking team commemorated the milestone by noting that he had made 13,435 false or misleading statements since occupying the White House, an average of 13.4 falsehoods a day. The Post\u2019s tally, as well as similar efforts by FactCheck.org, PolitiFact and CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale, all but prove that the author of Trump\u2019s wetware must have selected \u201clie\u201d as his default setting.\n\nIn his hour-long remarks during a Monday meeting with his Cabinet, Trump was at it again, repeatedly lying and stretching the truth. He lied about the number of people who attended his recent Dallas rally. He falsely claimed that President Barack Obama tried to call North Korean leader Kim Jong-un \u201c11 times.\u201d Once again, he falsely asserted that he was \u201cbringing our soldiers back home.\u201d He bent reality with the stupid claim that no president besides George Washington ever forfeited his salary\u2014when both Herbert Hoover and John Kennedy did so. He called the emoluments clause \u201cphony.\u201d And so on and so on. CNN\u2019s Dale and co-author Tara Subramaniam identified 20 fibs from Trump\u2019s Cabinet monologue.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA lesser liar might be deterred by platoons of fact-checkers dispensing \u201cPinocchios\u201d and \u201cPants on Fire\u201d labels to his utterances, but Trump is anything but a lesser liar. No matter the amount of truth-squading the press throws at him, he remains determined to manure the discourse with his lies. It\u2019s enough to make the most dedicated fact-checker stop tracking Trump and assume that every word he speaks is a lie.\n\nSo should we give up on monitoring him? Of course not. The weatherman doesn\u2019t suspend his forecasts just because they fail to discourage hurricanes, tornadoes and superbolts from inflicting mayhem. But perhaps the fact-checkers could be persuaded to augment their approach. Fact-checking starts with the premise that politicians mostly tell the truth and offer only the occasional brazen lie. Trump\u2019s case reverses that equation\u2014his true statements are his notable outliers. Because they are so unique, perhaps we should start giving them greater notice in hopes of nudging the president in the direction of accuracy and honesty. As a petulant but devoted reader of the press, Trump would notice a headline reading \u201cPresident Trump Said Something True Yesterday,\u201d and maybe tamp down on the lying.\n\nSubjecting the president to this sort of operant conditioning through press coverage is not an entirely new idea. Michael Kinsley tried something like this two years ago in a brief series of New York Times opinion pieces under the rubric of \u201cSay Something Nice About Trump\u201d that sought to reinforce the president\u2019s policy successes and his creative destruction of the political order. But Kinsley\u2019s project didn\u2019t do much to steer Trump toward the truth. For that, I think we need to heed the finding of psychological researchers who, several years ago, found that children who lied habitually were more open to reform if told that truthfulness was good than if told lying was bad. Chiding the liars for lying seemed only to make them lie more. Trump\u2019s child-like demeanor\u2014his tantrums and fits, his narcissism, his breath-holding when he doesn\u2019t get his way, his heavy reliance on \u201cmean words,\u201d his endless pouting\u2014hints that treating him like a kid and rewarding him for truth-telling rather than punishing him for lying might pay modest dividends.\n\nThe fact-checkers at PolitiFact already do a version of this by keeping a running score of disputed Trump statements ultimately judged to be true (5 percent of the 723 Trump statements examined so far). A more comprehensive list of things Trump has gotten right won\u2019t turn Lyin\u2019 Trump into Honest Abe overnight. But in a political culture starved for an agreed-upon set of facts from which to debate, a pamphlet (however slim) of collected Trump truths would come in handy, especially should a national security or economic crisis strike. Such a pamphlet might also benefit the president and his staff by giving them a sense of where to find common ground with their foes. I\u2019m agnostic on who this job should go to\u2014it could go to the fact-checkers, the commentariat, or even Chris Cuomo. Can\u2019t you just imagine him in a muscle shirt scribbling like mad on a whiteboard about Trump\u2019s latest expression of truth?\n\nThe idea that we could prod Trump toward honesty might over-estimate his relationship with the truth. Does he even know the difference? As the writer Windsor Mann tweeted this week, \u201cWhen Trump tells the truth, it is by accident.\u201d We probably don\u2019t want to do anything that might increase the number of Trump accidents, lest we inspire one that causes everything to go kablooey. But even Pinocchio, the Washington Post fact-checkers\u2019 avatar of lies, was capable of telling the intermittent, rare truth. If a boy born with wood for brains could achieve personhood by proving himself brave and truthful, there\u2019s got to be hope for Trump.\n\n******\n\n\u201cLies\u201d by the Knickerbockers was my favorite faux Beatles song.
