Federal prosecutors contend that the bank\u2019s former CEO and founder, Stephen Calk, managed to get Manafort approved for about $16 million in loans despite numerous \u201cred flags\u201d related to his finances.\n\nIn May, a federal grand jury in New York City indicted Calk for scheming to use the loan approvals to win an economic advisory post on the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and to seek a job in the Trump administration. Calk even suggested himself for a Cabinet position. He was ultimately interviewed for Secretary of the Army, but did not get nominated.\n\nCalk has pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of soliciting a bribe in exchange for aid from a federally regulated financial institution. His defense attorney has claimed that, like the bank, the executive was a victim of Manafort\u2019s fraud.\n\n\u201cTFSB\u2026submits that what the bank officers and owners knew at the time they provided the loans to the Defendant about Defendant\u2019s criminal conduct is irrelevant,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote, arguing that the bank\u2019s position was \u201cwholly inconsistent\u201d with federal law.\n\nGetting additional testimony about the bank\u2019s knowledge \u201cmay be further complicated\u201d by the pending criminal prosecution of Calk, the government said.\n\nHowever, legal submission from the Mueller team in both Virginia and D.C. federal courts identified the bank as one of Manafort\u2019s victims. The Virginia judge even ordered $15.3 million in restitution for the bank.\n\nThe bank\u2019s attorneys told Jackson that the legal issue at stake \u201cdoes not require discovery, or even a hearing.\u201d\n\nThe bank\u2019s lawyers also claim Mueller\u2019s prosecutors never established that the assets in dispute were actually the product of the crimes Manafort admitted to, as opposed to properties simply offered up to facilitate his plea deal.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Calk would benefit financially if the bank prevails in its legal quest to claim an interest in the Manafort properties. Calk owned about two-thirds of the bank at the time the loans went to Manafort.\n\nIf Jackson grants the bank\u2019s request for first dibs on as much as $15.5 million in Manafort assets, that could dramatically affect public accountings of the overall cost of Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation ran up about $32 million in direct and indirect costs before wrapping up in May, according to a report issued in August by the Justice Department. President Donald Trump has used a higher figure of about $40 million, which appears to have been based on budget estimates.\n\nSome Mueller backers and various press accounts have countered that Mueller\u2019s investigation was ultimately a wash or even a net plus for the federal treasury, once the money he took in was accounted for.\n\n\u201cThe cost of your investigation to the taxpayers approaches zero,\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said to Mueller during a July hearing. Nadler credited the special counsel with pulling in up to $42 million in fines and forfeitures.\n\nSome news stories said Manafort alone could wind up surrendering as much as $46 million in cash, securities and property to the feds. But those figures seem wildly inflated.\n\nBoth the total cost of Mueller\u2019s probe and the amount of money it should be credited with bringing in for the Treasury are open to dispute. One problem is that many reports simply tallied up the full value of Manafort\u2019s properties, not his equity in them.\n\nFor instance, Manafort\u2019s Trump Tower apartment recently went on the market for $3.6 million. But UBS Bank had a $3 million mortgage on the property which the U.S. Government agreed to recognize after that bank also went to court to enforce its rights.\n\nThe offering price for the Trump Tower condo was just cut to under $3.5 million, but so far it hasn\u2019t been sold. Considering costs of sale, accumulating interest and late fees, it\u2019s possible that in the end the feds see little or nothing from that high-profile Manafort property.\n\nProsecutors never argued that the Trump Tower apartment, which Manafort bought using a shell company in 2006, was acquired with ill-gotten funds. It was offered up during plea negotiations as Manafort\u2019s lawyers sought to preserve assets for Manafort\u2019s wife, Kathleen, and for the once notoriously high-living political consultant to subsist on when he gets out of prison.\n\nIn the end, Paul Manafort essentially traded the Trump Tower apartment for a Charles Schwab brokerage account prosecutors had frozen. He also agreed to give up a Chinatown apartment to prevent seizure of a home in Arlington, Virginia, owned by his daughter Andrea and her husband, Christopher Shand, that was purchased with money Manafort wired in from overseas.\n\nReports at the time said the deal allowed Manafort to keep both his condo on the Alexandria, Virginia, waterfront and his home in Palm Beach, Florida. However, Federal Savings Bank foreclosed on the Alexandria apartment and has it on the market for $3.2 million, according to Realtor.com. It\u2019s unclear if that could reduce the debt the bank is seeking to cover in the fight with the feds.\n\nJudges ordered Manafort to pay about $6 million in back taxes, while the forfeitures seem to have been aimed at netting about $11-12 million for the U.S. Government, representing profits from the illegal schemes Manafort admitted to. The plea deal simply lists the properties and the accounts to be surrendered, but does not value them.\n\nThere are also legitimate questions about what fines and payments can be attributed to Mueller\u2019s probe. Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen was fined $50,000 and sentenced to a mere two months on a lying-to-Congress charge brought by Mueller\u2019s office.\n\nHowever, the same judge ordered a three-year sentence for Cohen, another $500,000 in forfeiture for bank fraud, and $1.3 million in back taxes in a tax evasion and campaign-finance focused case that was technically handled by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan but closely tied to the Mueller investigation.\n\nAnother example: Mueller\u2019s interest in Manafort\u2019s foreign ties led to an aggressive spinoff investigation of a high-powered law firm he commissioned for work related to Ukraine, Skadden Arps. That probe, focused on alleged violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, was also handed off to federal prosecutors in Manhattan. In January, the firm agreed to register for its work and to pay $4.6 million to the U.S. Treasury to resolve the issue.\n\nThat foreign-agent probe also led to a failed false-statement prosecution earlier this year against former Skadden lawyer and Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig. A judge dismissed one of those charges, while a jury acquitted him on another last month. The costs of those follow-on investigations are not included in Mueller\u2019s financial reports.\n\nGovernment lawyers say they recently made a new settlement proposal to the Chicago bank. The bank\u2019s lawyers say the two sides are at an impasse.\n\nWhile Justice Department attorneys say they need more information to resolve the bank\u2019s claims, they also say they plan to ask the judge soon to approve the sale of both the Long Island and Brooklyn properties even as the legal fight with the bank continues. The bank says it will oppose such a sale.\n\nMost of Manafort\u2019s other properties and accounts were formally transferred to the feds in May.\n\nThe jury at Manafort\u2019s trial in Alexandria, Virginia, last August could not reach a unanimous verdict on the four bank fraud charges related to the loans he took out during the Trump campaign and transition from the closely held, veteran-focused Chicago bank. A verdict sheet shows jurors split, 11-1, on those charges. Manafort was convicted there on eight other felony counts.\n\nAs part of the plea deal struck with prosecutors a few months later, Manafort acknowledged his guilt on all the charges he faced.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/de/f9/ddcb93874f278203e2229f799aea/190222-manafort-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
