Following the theme \u201cBollywood Rewind\u201d, the students, teachers and parents involved worked to recreate the India of the early 2000s.\n\nJain festival Paryushana uses prayer, fasting and meditation to ask for forgiveness\n\nOn the day of the event, Young Post spoke to two Year Nine student dancers Riya Girish and Anusha Oak, both 13, who performed in multiple numbers in the show that took place in the school hall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really fun time of the year. We get to do something we love, with a purpose,\u201d said Riya, referring to the fact that the event helped to raise funds for World Vision India, a charity that supports underprivileged children in the country.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s also an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and do something new,\u201d added Anusha.\n\nVideo of Bharatanatyam 101: an intro to the traditional Indian dance\n\nAs colourful lights filled the stage, the night kicked off with a performance by the team that organised the event. Five students \u2013 four girls and one boy \u2013 dressed in traditional Indian costumes danced along to the Bollywood song Bachna ae Haseeno.\n\nDuring the intermission, proud parents seized the opportunity to take pictures of their children on stage. A photo booth was also set up where guests could take selfies with cut-outs of Indian stars such as Priyanka Chopra and Hrithik Roshan.\n\nAnother highlight was when a group of students performed traditional Bollywood dances with a modern twist. Riya and three of her peers performed an Indian dance battle piece in harem pants and a modern top. She explained that their costume combined Indian culture with a bit of Indo-western style.\n\nWhat is Diwali, and how is it celebrated?\n\n\u201cInitially, we thought of wearing lehenga, which is a type of Indian skirt, but we wanted to be able to show the leg movements of our dance,\u201d she said.\n\nRiya added that the fact it would\u2019ve been harder to dance in lehenga than in harem pants led to the final costume decision.\n\nAfter seeing how captivated the audience was by the students\u2019 stunning choreography and talent, the student organisers knew their event had been a success.\n\nSudiksha Shinde, 13, performed Adele\u2019s Rolling in the Deep in her Indian-inspired costume.

It means we were doing something that was important to us,\u201d she added.\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda", "description": "The ESF school went all out for the festival of lights, with delicious Indian food and vibrant performances under the theme 'Bollywood Rewind'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/c6df31e2-f541-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires114736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
