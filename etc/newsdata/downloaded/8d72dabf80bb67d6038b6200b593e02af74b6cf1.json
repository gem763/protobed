Didn\u2019t get much resistance from her opponent, either.\n\nLooking as dominant as can be, Williams moved just fine and powered her way into the U.S. Open semifinals by overwhelming 18th-seeded Wang Qiang of China 6-1, 6-0 in a mere 44 minutes Tuesday night to move closer to a 24th Grand Slam singles trophy.\n\nWilliams had rolled her ankle during her fourth-round match but never showed any signs that it was an issue.\n\n\u201cPhysically, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Williams said, \u201cand more than anything, I\u2019m having fun every time I come out here.\u201d\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t she? When she plays like this, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else ending up with the championship Saturday.\n\nWilliams grabbed the first five games in about 15 minutes. Then, after dropping one game, Williams collected the next 11 points in a row and every remaining game.\n\nJust one indication of how lopsided this was: Williams finished with 25 winners to zero for Wang, who was playing in her first major quarterfinal. One other: The total points were 50-15.\n\nWilliams collected her 100th match win at Flushing Meadows, where she is a six-time champion.\n\n\u201cFrom when I first started here \u2026 I never thought that I would get to 100. Didn\u2019t even cross my mind I would still be out here,\u201d said Williams who turns 38 later this month. \u201cBut I love what I do.\u201d\n\nThe American will face No. 5 seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine for a berth in the final. Svitolina eliminated 16th-seeded Johanna Konta of Britain 6-4, 6-4 earlier Tuesday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had a great year, as well,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI feel like she wants to go one further this time, so I have to be able to come out again and play really well.\u201d\n\nWith her boyfriend, Gael Monfils, watching in the stands, a day before he plays his quarterfinal, Svitolina got to the semifinals at a second consecutive major tournament after never having been that far before.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Svitolina joked about Monfils, \u201che needs to step up his game.\u201d\n\nNo. 13 Monfils of France takes on No. 24 Matteo Berrettini of Italy, and Rafael Nadal meets No. 20 Diego Schwartzman of Argentina on Wednesday, when the women\u2019s quarterfinals will be No. 13 Belinda Bencic of Switzerland vs. No. 23 Donna Vekic of Croatia, and No. 15 Bianca Andreescu of Canada vs. No. 25 Elise Mertens of Belgium.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s last match featured Roger Federer against Grigor Dimitrov, with the winner playing the man the U.S. Open crowds love to hate, Daniil Medvedev.\n\nThe No. 5-seeded Medvedev thought he might need to quit early in the first set of his quarterfinal after pulling a muscle in his upper left leg. His opponent, three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka, never believed Medvedev would stop. Wawrinka was right. And now Medvedev, the best player on the men\u2019s tour on hard courts in recent weeks, is headed to his first Grand Slam semifinal.\n\nMedvedev has drawn plenty of attention at Flushing Meadows for the way he sarcastically thanked booing crowds, trolling them by suggesting their venom was reason he kept winning. Now maybe folks will pay more attention to the 23-year-old Russian\u2019s unusual brand of shape-shifting tennis, which carried him past Wawrinka 7-6 (6), 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 despite 12 double-faults and a body that\u2019s just short of breaking down.\n\nAsked how he\u2019d describe his relationship with the fans in New York, who jeered him when he was introduced in Arthur Ashe Stadium but offered cheers later, Medvedev replied: \u201cI have two words. First one, for sure, \u2018electric,\u2019 because it\u2019s electric. And second one, \u2018controversy.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many people like my interviews. So many people don\u2019t like me,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI can just say: I try to be myself, guys.\u201d\n\nReprising his professional wrestling persona briefly, he added, \u201cI have to say, \u2018Sorry, guys.\u2019 And, \u2018Thank you,\u2019\u201d and then he laughed.\n\nTo say Williams was the overwhelming favorite heading into this stage of the two-week tournament would be a massive understatement.\n\nHer accomplishments and accolades far outweigh those of all of the other remaining players in the women\u2019s field.\n\nNot only was Williams the only one of the eight female quarterfinalists to ever have won a Grand Slam singles title, but she also was the only who even has reached a major final before.\n\nWhile Williams reached her 38th career Slam semifinal by beating Wang, the other seven quarterfinalists had participated in a combined total of five major semis, going 0-5 in those matches.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Looking as dominant as can be, Williams moved just fine and powered her way into the U.S. Open semifinals by overwhelming 18th-seeded Wang Qiang of China 6-1, 6-0 in a mere 44 minutes Tuesday night to move closer to a 24th Grand Slam singles trophy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/us_open_tennis_52889_c0-85-2048-1279_s1770x1032.jpg?8abd4db63be558cd22baad66f952c744d2e65008"}
