(Fethi Belaid/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNewlyweds Kyle Walker and Francesca Angell had planned two weeks of sightseeing for their Los Angeles honeymoon: Touring around Universal Studios Hollywood and Venice Beach, Calif. Shopping in Santee Alley. A side trip to Las Vegas.\n\nBut the couple instead spent much of Sunday on the phone, trying to figure out if and how they would be able to get back home to Nottingham, England, later this week, as the low-cost airline on which they\u2019d flown to the U.S. teetered into collapse \u2014 and their ticket home vanished into thin air.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been frantically trying to figure out what to do,\u201d Walker, 32, told The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying and it adds an extra stress on what should have been a nice, quiet, relaxing time.\u201d\n\nThe swift collapse on Sunday evening of the U.K.-based Thomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest tour operator, has put tens of thousands of jobs in jeopardy and stranded 600,000 travelers in vacation spots across the globe, prompting the British government to launch the largest peacetime repatriation effort in its history.\n\nIn an effort it has dubbed \u201cOperation Matterhorn,\u201d officials have begun dispensing dozens of charter planes across the world \u2014 from Spain to Malaysia \u2014 to return stranded passengers to the U.K., through Oct. 6. After that, officials warn, passengers may need to book their own flights home.\n\nPeter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, said the company\u2019s collapse was a \u201cmatter of profound regret.\u201d He offered an apology to the to the company\u2019s \u201cmillions of customers, and thousands of employees.\"\n\nInevitably, perhaps, Britain\u2019s political crisis has already cast a shadow on the company\u2019s demise: Thomas Cook executives have blamed Brexit for the company\u2019s troubles, while frustrated travelers and company employees have pointed to the government\u2019s failure to bail out the firm. Others have said that it\u2019s thanks to a European Union law that some travelers have the insurance to protect their vacation packages.\n\n\u201cIn the UK, the political uncertainty related to Brexit over recent months has led to softer demand for summer holidays across the industry,\u201d the company said in a May statement announcing $1.865 billion in losses.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a \u201cdifficult situation\u201d and said his thoughts were with customers, according to CNN.\n\n\u201cOne way or the other,\u201d he said, \u201cthe state will have to step in quite rightly to help stranded holidaymakers.\u201d\n\nBut as Thomas Cook planes arriving at U.K. airports are already being seized on behalf of creditors and lenders, some are asking if that effort \u2014 at an estimated $750 million cost to taxpayers \u2014 could not have come earlier.\n\nJohnson said the government had rejected the company\u2019s bailout request of about $187 million, according to Reuters, because doing so would have set up a \u201cmoral hazard.\u201d Company executives, not the government, must be responsible for dealing with its finances, he said.\n\nLen McCluskey, the general secretary for a union that represents some Thomas Cook employees, slammed Johnson for inaction and said the union will be seeking legal action over a \u201cfailure to consult on the redundancies that have resulted from the firm\u2019s collapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of stepping in and giving Thomas Cook the breathing space it needed to restructure its finances,\u201d McCluskey said, \u201cthe government\u2019s \u2018do nothing\u2019 attitude has left workers and customers high and dry.\u201d\n\nThe 178-year-old company was started by a cabinetmaker, Thomas Cook, who organized rail trips for temperance supporters and Sunday schools starting in the 1840s. The voyages he planned were some of the first package vacation deals, and Cook went on to organize trips that drew thousands to London and then corners of Europe and the Middle East. With a catchy tagline \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t just book it, Thomas Cook it!\u201d \u2014 the company became a household name as a budget-friendly getaway option for the British middle class, expanding into hotels, resorts and retail stores.\n\nBut several poorly timed deals a decade ago left the company with more than $2 billion in debt, Reuters reported, as the company struggled to compete online and pitch itself to a new generation of travelers.\n\nA 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, one of its top destinations, slashed business. So did a heat wave across Europe last summer that made many Brits stay home. To cover its interest payments alone, the company had to sell three million vacation packages a year.\n\nThe Guardian reported that Thomas Cook made a number of last-minute proposals to save the company, including asking lenders to reduce a nearly $250 million demand for additional funding and appealing to the British government for a bailout.\n\nIn a statement posted to its website at approximately 10 p.m. Sunday, the debt-ridden company said it had \u201cno choice but to take steps to enter into compulsory liquidation with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe company told CNN that it has 600,000 customers on vacation, including an estimated 160,000 from the United Kingdom, in countries as far as China and Cuba.\n\nThe move is also expected to leave 21,000 employees without a job. On social media, many indicated that they had received no communication from Thomas Cook at all.\n\nWhen we landed early hours of this morning. Us crew were in tears and the caterers came on, and gave us all a hug and said \u2018I don\u2019t know you personally, but I\u2019m going to give you a hug as hugs make things better\u2019 whoever you were thank you \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Emily Rose (@EmilyRose_98) September 23, 2019\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the British government is putting together a task force to help all the unemployed.\n\nThe chaos has also cascaded to hotels, like one in Tunisia that appeared not to let guests leave the premises if they didn\u2019t pay additional fees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being held hostage,\u201d Ryan Farmer, a guest at the Les Orangers resort, told BBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve been up to the gates, they had four security guards on the gates, holding the gates closed, and were not allowing anybody to leave.\"\n\nHamed Hfaiedh, a night receptionist at the hotel, told The Washington Post that the incident was a misunderstanding. The hotel was due to be paid in part by Thomas Cook, and hotel officials were worried that they would not end up getting paid with the company\u2019s impending collapse.\n\nThe gates to the hotel were later opened, BBC reported, though after one elderly woman paid over $2,400 in additional fees.\n\nIn Turkey, meanwhile, tourism authorities said that hotels cannot seek additional payments from customers, according to the state news agency.\n\nIncidents like these have made for a messy and inauspicious end for the storied travel company. What started as a rail tour operated by Cook so many years ago ended in a final flight, leaving from Orlando, that landed in Manchester, England, around 3 a.m. Monday.", "description": "The 178-year-old company, the world's first tour operator, had struggled with debt and competing in the online era.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Local Reporter", "September At Am", "Teo Armus Is A Reporter Covering Local Politics", "Other News In The D.C.
