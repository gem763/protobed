It\u2019s offered for sale this time from the collection of James and Marilyn Alsdorf, prominent business owners and art patrons in Chicago.\n\nPortrait of a Lady in White was offered for sale\u2014the first time on the auction block\u2014from the William Louis-Dreyfus Foundation, with proceeds benefiting the late philanthropist\u2019s eponymous foundation and The Harlem Children's Zone.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus, heir to Louis Dreyfus Group, a global merchant firm that does business in agriculture, food processing, international shipping, and finance, died in 2016 at age 84.\n\nThe oil-on-canvas portrait was painted around the time of Kahlo\u2019s marriage to Rivera in 1929. It was initially gifted by the artist to Mexican photographer Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo, L and was on extended loan to Stanford University from The William Louis-Dreyfus Foundation.\n\nFrida Kahlo's Portrait of a Lady in White Courtesy of Christie's\n\nKahlo was the first Latin-American artist to cross the million-dollar threshold with her 1949 painting Diego y Yo, which netted $1.4 million at Sotheby\u2019s in May 1990. In 2016, her 1939 painting Two Nudes in the Forest (The Earth Itself) sold at Christie\u2019s New York for $8 million, the highest price for any Latin American artist. Later in May 2018, Rivera claimed the title with the sale of his painting The Rivals, which fetched $9.8 million at a Christie\u2019s auction of the collection of David and Peggy Rockefeller.\n\nAnother highlight of Christie\u2019s sale of Latin American art, which will take place at its Rockefeller Center galleries from Nov. 20 to 22 and online from Nov. 16 to 26, is Fernando Botero\u2019s Tablao Flamenco.\n\nExecuted in 1984, this work is one of the most important paintings by the artist to come to auction in recent years. It has a presale estimate of between $1.5 million and $2 million. Complementing this piece is a robust selection of works by the Colombian master that includes paintings, drawings, and exquisite sculptures.\n\nAdditionally, the sale will feature Latin American works from other important private collections, including The Collection of Dr. Helga Prignitz-Poda, The Collection of Richard L. Weisman, and The Collection of James Li, ranging from 17th- and 18th-century Spanish colonial paintings through modern and contemporary masterpieces.\n\nTogether, the sales are expected to realize in excess of $25 million.\n\nA preview of select works will begin on Nov. 16 at Christie\u2019s Rockefeller Center galleries in New York.", "description": "\u201cThe Flower Basket\u201d and \u201cPortrait of a Lady in White\u201d could fetch $5 million apiece", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-120872/social", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
