A board committee will \u201cidentify, review and explore all strategic and financial alternatives,\u201d including a sale of MoviePass and Moviefone, the company said Friday.\n\nThe announcement brings to a close a two-year saga that shook the cinema industry with a monthly subscription that offered unlimited moviegoing for one low price.\n\nLed by penny stock investor Ted Farnsworth and former Netflix executive Mitch Lowe, MoviePass was unable to keep up with the demand it created with its $10-a-month plan or profitably offer a service that effectively subsidized moviegoing. Still MoviePass helped boost attendance, and theater owners across the country took notice.\n\n\u201cThe company is unable to predict if or when the MoviePass service will continue,\u201d Helios said.\n\nThe service spurred leaders like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. to offer their own subscriptions, while MoviePass\u2019s precarious finances forced the service to continually cut back and find ways to stay afloat. The July shutdown was called an effort to revamp its app and recapitalize.\n\nFarnsworth has a string of ventures behind him, from psychic phone lines to energy drinks, some of which lost all their value. At one point, Helios shares advanced 1,151%. Today it trades below a penny.\n\nThe company is being investigated by the New York Attorney General for securities fraud and faces class action lawsuits.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Anousha Sakoui in los angeles at asakoui@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Rob Golum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- It looks like the curtain has fallen for good on MoviePass.Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc., owner of the pioneering movie-theater subscription service, is considering a sale and other options after suspending its operations two months ago.
