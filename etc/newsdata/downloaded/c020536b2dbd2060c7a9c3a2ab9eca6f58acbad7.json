Big saving. Love it.\u2019\n\nOf course, if you don\u2019t have a table you could pick one up second hand and transform it using Charlotte\u2019s tips to fit your own colour scheme.\n\nWhat a great idea.\n\nMORE: Get paid \u00a3770 to watch Disney movies every day for a month\n\nMORE: This banana phone can be yours for the ripe price of \u00a332\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Charlotte Blackmore transformed her dining set with paint and chair covers", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/before-and-after-of-charlotte-blackmores-table_1571580400.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
