Tebow notes that his jersey, which rivaled NBA superstars such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James as one of the top-selling apparel items when he played college football for Florida, vigorously defended the current system.\n\nAs things stand right now, the NCAA and individual athletic departments profit from the sale of items such as jerseys. College athletes, many of whom are on scholarships, do not see a penny of that revenue.\n\n\u201cI feel like I have a little bit of credibility and knowledge about this because when I was at the University of Florida, my jersey was one of the top-selling jerseys around the world \u2026 It was like Kobe, LeBron\u2026and I was right behind them,\u201d Tebow said Friday on the ESPN's \"First Take.\"\n\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t make a dollar from it, but nor did I want to. Because I knew going into college, what it was all about. I knew going to Florida, going to my dream school, where I wanted to \u2013 the passion for it. If I could support my team, support my college, support my university \u2013 that\u2019s what it is all about.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA first-round draft pick who has given up football to play baseball in the minor league system of the New York Mets, Tebow also doubles as a college football analyst for ESPN. He won both the Heisman Trophy and the Maxwell Award as the nation\u2019s top player.\n\nThe structure of college sports and the scholarships that prop up the system precludes athletes from being paid. Tebow said this isn\u2019t a bad thing and is actually part of the appeal to fans (and athletes, at least himself).\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re changing it from us, from we, from my university, from being an alumni where I care which makes college football and college sports special,\u201d Tebow said.\n\n\u201cTo then [change that mentality to] OK it\u2019s not about us, it\u2019s not about we. It\u2019s just about me. And yes I know we live in a selfish culture where it is all about us but we\u2019re just adding and piling on to that. Where it changes what is special about college football and we\u2019re turning into the NFL where who has the most money, that\u2019s where you go.\u201d", "description": "Tim Tebow is against college football players profiting from the use of their image and likeness.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/11/0/0/tim-tebow-throw.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
