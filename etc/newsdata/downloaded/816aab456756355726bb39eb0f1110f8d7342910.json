(Photo: Instagram)\n\nA message about kindness is going viral on Instagram, reminding kids heading back to school to stand up to bullies and make a difference in another student\u2019s life by being nice.\n\nThe sweet sentiment seemingly originated on Joe Schilling\u2019s Instagram account on Monday evening, where the MMA fighter posted a typed out note with the caption, \u201cBeing nice is cool.\u201d\n\nIn it, the note provided a \u201cspecial request\u201d to those returning to school.\n\n\u201cIf you see someone who is struggling to make friends or being bullied because he/she doesn\u2019t have many friends or because they are shy or not as pretty or not dressed in the most \u2018in\u2019 clothes \u2014 PLEASE step up,\u201d the post reads. \u201cSay hi or at least smile at them in the hallway.\u201d\n\nSchilling went on to explain that \u201cyou never know what that person might be facing outside of school,\u201d before writing, \u201cRepost if you agree.\u201d\n\nHours later, the post has been seen across a number of Instagram pages and stories, including Chris Pratt, Joe Rogan, Ashley Graham and Mario Dedivanovic.\n\nHundreds of people have also commented on Schilling\u2019s post, sharing their appreciation for the martial artist and his empowering message.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I appreciate this post,\u201d one person commented. \u201cThis is what I tell my students the whole first month of school. I also let them know that my doors are open during recess and lunch for them to have a quiet place to sit and relax.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote, \u201cExcellent post Brother! Im having my daughter who admires you read this when she gets home today. Thank you.\u201d\n\nSchilling also re-posted a video to his Instagram story of a young child performing an act of kindness at school after reading Schiller\u2019s encouraging words.\n\n\u201cBest thing to teach kids is kindness,\u201d a follower concluded.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "People and celebrities all over Instagram are sharing this reminder for kids to be kind as they head back to school.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y_mp.vBEs0OsqOWAMc7niw--~B/aD0zNjU7dz00ODE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d8bbd6d0-ce82-11e9-a9ef-8628fca530bd"}
