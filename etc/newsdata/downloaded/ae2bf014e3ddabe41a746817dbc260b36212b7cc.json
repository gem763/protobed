Over time they have honed in on the three key things that people want to see on the big screen: the powerful bond of family, cool car stunts, and huge, muscle-bound men slamming into each other like competing walruses.\n\nEach entry in the franchise has matched the efforts of its predecessor, but with the addition of another beloved actor and an increase in stakes for both the plot and the stunts. Each is more insane and less grounded in reality than the last and it absolutely whips. It\u2019s hard to say how they\u2019re going to top Fate of the Furious with the ninth instalment in the series but we do know one thing: this one has Cardi B in it.\n\nThe announcement was made today on Vin Diesel\u2019s Instagram, in a video showing the pair on the UK set of the movie on the 86th day of filming:\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what role she will be playing but, my god, I hope it involves her driving a 70s muscle car up a volcano or some shit.", "description": "Vin Diesel announced on his Instagram account that Cardi B is joining the world of Fast & Furious, which hopefully involves mad car stunts.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178309659.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
