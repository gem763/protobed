The science and history explained", "language": "en", "text": "\n\n\n\nVaping has been dominating the news, with politicians and experts going back and forth about whether it\u2019s good for smokers \u2014 or simply poison. But what exactly is vaping in the first place? And how does it work?\n\nVaping was intended to help smokers\n\nThe first documented mention of an electronic cigarette in 1930, when Joseph Robinson filed a patent for an \u201celectric vaporizer\u201d three years prior.\n\nThe idea was to create a device that was easy to use, to vaporize medicinal compounds, and not burn the user. But the product didn\u2019t reach the market, according to a working paper by libertarian think tank Reason Foundation.\n\nSeveral decades later in 1963, Herbert Gilbert filed a patent for a \u201csmokeless non-tobacco cigarette.\u201d Gilbert argued that his invention presented a \u201csafe and harmless\u201d way for smoking tobacco, \u201creplacing burning tobacco and paper with heated, moist flavored air.\u201d\n\nA photo from Gilbert's patent. (Source: U.S. Patent No. 3,200,819) More\n\n\u201cI am the first inventor and [patent holder] of the e-cig,\u201d Gilbert declared in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \u201cI wanted to \u2026 give people that are smokers \u2014 I smoked at the time \u2014 the opportunity to stop smoking, and that's it.\u201d\n\nGilbert had no prior experience in creating these designs: \u201cI\u2019m an old scrap dealer,\u201d the 88-year-old said. Gilbert filed his patent with an attorney and included drawings \u201cand everything else\u201d done by him.\n\nThe product failed to reach the market. Gilbert attributed that failure to pressure from Big Tobacco.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I started to do work with the patent, the cigarette companies and the pharmacies did everything they could to stop me,\u201d he alleged. \u201cThey fought me. \u2026 They fought me until the patent expired and then they all jumped on [it]... They just flopped the heck out of me.\u201d\n\nEventually, in 2003, a Chinese pharmacist created a device that \u201cbecame the basis for practically all of subsequent vape products,\u201d the Reason Foundation researchers stated. And e-cigarettes began to appear on American shores in roughly 2007, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n(Source: CDC) More\n\nTypes of e-cigs\n\nToday\u2019s device generally comes in a couple of different forms.\n\nWhile they vary \u201cwidely in design and appearance\u2026 [they] generally operate in a similar manner and are composed of similar components,\u201d according to the CDC.\n\nThey can be any of the following: e-cigarettes, e-cigs, cigalikes, e-hookahs, mods, vape pens, vapes, and tank systems.\n\nThey can be disposable, rechargeable, or they can come in one body or with a tank attached, as seen in the graphic above.\n\nA vape shop worker organizes electronic smoking products in a local store in Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S., September 12, 2019.
