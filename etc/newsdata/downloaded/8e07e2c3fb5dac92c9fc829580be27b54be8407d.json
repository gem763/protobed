Greear tearfully embraced survivors on stage at the annual convention. More recently, he told a committee of church leaders, \u201cI believe in this last year, thanks to your leadership, things are changing.\u201d\n\nAt the annual convention this summer, members approved an amendment to the SBC constitution, identifying sexual abuse as grounds for a church to be deemed \u201cnot in friendly cooperation\u201d with the convention. Another amendment added to the bylaws would allow a standing committee to investigate allegations of sexual abuse.\n\nBut in interviews with The Associated Press, many survivors said they are skeptical of the meeting\u2019s ability to bring about accountability to the loosely affiliated network of more than 47,000 individual churches comprising 14.8 million members.\n\n\u201cThe anger in the survivor community has been extremely valuable for instigating change,\u201d said Ms. Codone. \u201cBut changing the culture of the SBC will take generations.\u201d\n\nLeaders of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission say the conference has sold out with 1,600 attendees, about 40% of whom represent senior pastors and youth ministers and 60% represent laypeople.\n\nPanels will include \u201cLight in the Darkness: Abuse and the Hope of the Gospel,\u201d led by human rights attorney Gary Haugen, and \u201cFacts vs. Myths: Understanding Who Child Sexual Abusers Actually Are\u201d by Gregory Love, a child sexual abuse expert.\n\nThere also will be women-only and men-only panels.\n\n\u201cWe think that there are some things that people will be more willing to be candid about in a non-mixed setting than they would with everybody in the room,\u201d Mr. Bethancourt said.\n\nSome critics have suggested the SBC\u2019s lack of women in leadership roles \u2014 only men can be pastors \u2014 complicates the ability of church leaders to believe accounts of abuse from women.\n\nThe SBC\u2019s 52-page report issued in June addresses this criticism, citing its view that \u201cmen and women were equally created in God\u2019s image but have been given unique roles and gifting\u201d as evidence for why men and women should be involved in holding abusers accountable. The report says abuse can \u201chide behind theologies that minimizes \u2018gender roles\u2019 or in those that exaggerate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, what we learn when it comes to abuse is that it respects no theological framework,\u201d Mr. Bethancourt said. \u201cWe see abuse happening in structures like ours, who view gender and sexuality like us, and across the spectrum.\u201d\n\nOne outspoken survivor who will not be present is Christa Brown, an author and retired attorney who says she was abused by a Southern Baptist minister as a child. She suggested that organizers opted to invite survivors whose stories were deemed \u201crisk-free for the SBC.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have picked those who don\u2019t ask anything of them at this point,\u201d said Ms. Brown, who has been pushing the SBC to create an independently run database listing pastors and other church personnel who have been credibly accused of abuse.\n\nSo far, the SBC\u2019s structure of loosely affiliated churches has shielded it against sexual abuse victims seeking or winning big damages in court, as has been seen in the Catholic Church, where dioceses have paid hundreds of millions to plaintiffs. But a lawsuit filed in Virginia this summer will test that theory.\n\nAttorneys for eight minors in Chesterfield County, Virginia, are asking $82 million naming the SBC \u2014 as well as a former pastor and a youth leader\u2014 as defendants. The lawsuit states the SBC \u201coperated, managed, and controlled\u201d its member churches. An attorney for the plaintiffs told The Washington Times on Monday that SBC has not yet responded in court to the charges.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
