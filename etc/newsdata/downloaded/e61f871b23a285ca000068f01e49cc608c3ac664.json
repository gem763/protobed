How is that acting in their best interest and keeping them safe?'\n\nDavid recently served 5 months of a 10 month sentence, and must now sign the sex offenders register.\n\nHis probation officer Verity Barton called it 'quite a serious set of first time offences'.\n\nShe pointed to voyeurism, outraging public decency which involved upskirting, and went on to explain that he'd also been in possession of 'indecent images and indecent chats which were quite extreme'.\n\nVerity was stunned by David's revelation, and told him that he should be 'aware of the choices you're making'\n\nShe added: 'He was essentially caught when he was filming a female in his bathroom without her consent. So that's created huge problems for his family life.'\n\nDavid said he was 'disgusted' by his actions, saying: 'Ashamed, embarrassed of what I've done. It's going to take a long time to shake.\n\n'I haven't got much support since I've come out of prison. Lost most of support since I've come out of prison, family and friends.'\n\nBut during a meeting with probation worker Verity, he revealed that he'd found support from a developing relationship with a young mother called Sarah.\n\nHe said: 'Our friendship has changed and now there's slightly more to it. It's nice to speak to someone. And again, her knowing about things, well - at least the majority of things.'\n\nHe explained that she knew about all of his offences, except the 'camera thing'.\n\nVerity was stunned by the revelation that Sarah was a mother of young children, telling him: 'I wouldn't be expecting you to share any of her personal space.'\n\nHe said: 'Well she did say I could go over one day when the kids are in bed and stuff.'\n\nBut Verity was clear and determined, telling him: 'No you can't. Just be very aware of these choices you're making.\n\n'These are the seemingly unimportant decisions that may seem harmless, but in six months we shall see.'\n\nAnd later, Verity was aghast to discover that he was dating a different woman, who was also a mother of two young children\n\nAnd later, a shocked Verity told the camera: 'It took me by surprise, that is the first time he's ever mentioned a child. And then more concerning was his desire to still carry on.'\n\nA worried Verity phoned Sarah to ask her the full extent of what she knew and, unlike what David had told her, she said she had not known about any of his crimes against children.\n\nAnd Sarah told Verity David had always been aware she had children, saying: 'He knew straight away.'\n\nVerity told the police, who then informed the partner of the full extent of David's crimes, and she ended contact with him\n\nThe probation worker later told how David was 'angry' and 'unpredictable', having 'squared up' to her during a visit to his hostel\n\nAn upset David said: 'I really feel like I've gone back into f** it, I'm going to kill myself again. What have you got going for you at the moment? I've got no family. Like f*** it.'\n\nThree months after coming off license, Verity and a colleague paid an unannounced visit to David's hostel.\n\nHe told her that a summary of what he'd been doing, saying: 'Taking drugs and having sex.'\n\nAnd a terrified Verity said that he had gone on to 'square up' to her.\n\nVerity's colleague Jess revealed that David had spent nights away from the hostel he was supposed to be living, in violation of the conditions of his release from prison\n\nBut despite David being 'really angry' and 'unpredictable', she said there was 'nothing they could do'.\n\n'We just have to wait until he does something.'\n\nBut it wasn't long before new, serious allegations against David came to light, giving police the opportunity to look through his phone.\n\nProbation worker Jess said Wilkins said: 'I've looked through his conversations with friends and he makes reference to at least one night when he stayed with a girl and she has two young children.'\n\nAs the programme ended, it was revealed that David had started working, but was due in court for breaching the notification requirements of the sex offenders register.\n\nHowever, some viewers argued that he should not have been out of prison in the first place, or that he should have been returned to jail after announcing he was seeing Sarah.\n\nMany viewers were left shocked by the programme, and said they were amazed that mothers would get involved with a convicted sex offender\n\nOne added: ''Risk' must be deemed manageable in the community - sure it must be investigated as to whether she knows the extent of his offence?! I'm horrified.'\n\nOne commented: 'The minute he said he was talking to a woman with children should have gone back to prison. The woman seriously needs looking at letting a pedophile near her kids.'\n\nOne wrote: 'Pedophiles need locking up for life. They're constantly attracted to children like gay people are attracted to same sex and like straight people are attracted to opposite sex; pedophiles are a constant danger to society.'", "description": "Viewers of Channel 4's Crime and Punishment were left horrified after last night's episode, in which it was revealed that a convicted sex offender was dating various women who had young children.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/11/19736380-0-image-a-12_1571136302664.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
