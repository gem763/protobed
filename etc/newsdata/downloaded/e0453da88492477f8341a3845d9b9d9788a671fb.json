The problem is, Mr. O\u2019Brien doesn\u2019t seem like much of a lever puller \u2014 and in any case there are far fewer levers to pull. The National Security Council has atrophied under Mr. Trump, and especially during Mr. Bolton\u2019s tenure.\n\nInstead, Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s appointment is likely to mean that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will continue to be the president\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, a role he usurped from Mr. Bolton. Unfortunately, Secretary Pompeo has succeeded precisely because he seems to have few if any principles that he won\u2019t suppress for the sake of holding and wielding executive power. The Ed McMahon of American foreign policy, he is smart enough to be in on the Trump joke, doesn\u2019t care that it\u2019s not funny and laughs anyway.\n\nSome have suggested that Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo have formed a foreign-policy partnership comparable to that of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger , and that, therefore, we shouldn\u2019t worry about who sits atop the National Security Council. But Mr. Kissinger is an elite scholar, a powerful strategic mind and a policy entrepreneur who led and guided the Nixon administration\u2019s foreign policy. Mr. Pompeo is a non-expert who sees his role as catering to Mr. Trump\u2019s whims and carrying out his ideas.\n\nMr. Trump most likely hopes that Mr. O\u2019Brien will prove to be not an irrepressible ideologue, a foreign-policy entrepreneur or a consensus-building process expert, but rather a functionary who will provide an official veneer for the president\u2019s often outlandish views and moves.\n\nThis would mean the continued decay of the council-led interagency process. Thus unimpeded by contrary voices, Mr. Trump could continue with his tactic of the attempted grand bargain \u2014 with China, North Korea, even Iran in certain circumstances that now seem remote \u2014 which in turn would be put into motion by blunt instruments like tariffs, initiatives announced by tweet and military bluster and threats.", "description": "America needed someone to check the president\u2019s worst foreign-policy instincts.
