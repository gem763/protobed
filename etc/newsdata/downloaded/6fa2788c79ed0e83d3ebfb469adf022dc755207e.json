Yeah, I\u2019ll just say that.'\n\nTheron, who plays Megyn Kelly, did not get a chance to speak with Kelly however according to the latter's rep, while Gretchen Carlson was prohibited from speaking due to the terms of her $20 million settlement with Fox News and former CEO Roger Ailes.\n\nThat non-disclosure agreement did not stop Juliet Huddy however, who shared her story with screenwriter Charles Randolph.\n\nThat could cost the former anchor - who reportedly received a six-figure exit package after alleging she was sexually harassed by Bill O'Reilly - a $500,000 penalty.\n\n'I lost my house. My television career combusted, and I couldn\u2019t get a job for over a year,' Huddy told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n'So come after me. I don\u2019t have anything.'\n\nHuddy later disputed speaking to Randolph prior to filming and said that they met after the movie was shot and that she had no hand in the production.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nFormer Fox Newsers: Juliet Huddy (left with Megyn Kelly) received a six-figure payout from Fox News after accusing Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment, which required her to sign a NDA\n\nSilenced: Gretchen Carlson (above) says that she was upset by the fact that she was not able to tell her story to producers while they were developing the film because of her NDA. She is pictured above on Monday in NYC\n\nCarlson, who is portrayed by Nicole Kidman, says that she was upset by the fact that she was not able to tell her story to producers while they were developing the film.\n\n'It\u2019s really frustrating that because of my NDA, I can\u2019t participate in any of these projects,' notes Carlson.\n\n'It\u2019s why I\u2019m working so hard on the Hill to change that.'\n\nAnd despite the fact that the trailer is filled with scenes that seem to have been taken straight from Kelly's memoir Settle For More, she did not speak with producers and pocketed nothing from the project.\n\n'Megyn has never met or spoken to Charlize, and she did not sell the rights to the book [Settle For More],' says her attorney Bryan Freedman.\n\n'In fact, Megyn was as surprised as anyone when the trailer dropped.'\n\nBlonde ambition: Megyn Kelly did not speak with producers or star Charlize Theron and received no compensation, despite scenes that seemed to be taken from Settle For More. Pictured left to right: Theron (as Kelly), Nicole Kidman (as Carlson) and Margot Robbie (as producer Kayla Pospisil)\n\nHuddy told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not offered much control of how she was portrayed in the film, noting she learned about one scene after it had been shot.\n\n'I thought, \"Well, God, he\u2019s contacted me kind of late to get my perspective,\"' recalls Huddy.\n\n'I really do hope that they did their due diligence. I hope that they kept in mind the fact that while Gretchen and Megyn were turned into heroines, there were quite a few of us whose lives were turned upside down.'\n\nThis is not the first time that Huddy has spoken publicly, having previously shared her story with Kelly back in 2017 on Today.\n\nLess than an hour later, her brother John was fired by Fox News 'following a thorough investigation into a physical altercation earlier this month'.\n\nThe network said that the timing was a coincidence and that they were prepared to make the announcement Friday, but did not in observation of the Sabbath.\n\nThere was no explanation however as to why Huddy, who was stationed in Jerusalem, was fired at the end of the day and not first thing in the morning.\n\nShe did not go into any specific details at that time however, citing her NDA as the reason for her silence on certain topics.\n\nJuliet Huddy (center) speaks with Megyn Kelly during an interview on her show October 23\n\nKelly however stepped in to offer up some comments of her own.\n\n'At Fox News, the media relations chief Irena Briganti is known for her vindictiveness. To this day, she pushes negative articles on certain Ailes accuser, like the one you're looking at now,' the NBC anchor began as she welcomed Huddy onto her show.\n\n'It gives me no pleasure to report such news about my former employer which has absolutely made some reforms since all of this went down. But this must stop. The abuse of women, the shaming of them, the threatening, the retaliation. The silencing of them after-the-fact. It has to stop.'\n\nKelly also used the show as an opportunity to speak about her own experiences with sexual harassment at Fox, where she worked for more than a decade before coming to Fox News.\n\n'Fox News was not exactly a friendly environment for harassment victims who wanted to report, in my experience,' Kelly said.\n\n'However, O'Reilly's suggestion that no one complained about his behavior is false. I know because I complained.'\n\nFox News' now defunct parent company 21st Century Fox said at the time: 'Irena is a valued colleague and she has our full support.'\n\nFox News also responded in a lengthy statement.\n\n'Since the 2016 departure of Roger Ailes, Fox News has worked tirelessly to completely change the company culture,' noted a spokesperson.\n\n'Over the past three years, we have created an entirely new reporting structure, more than tripled the size of our HR footprint, instituted mandatory in-person sexual harassment training, started quarterly company meetings and mentoring events as well as implemented a zero tolerance policy regarding workplace misconduct for which we engage outside independent firms to handle investigations.\n\n'No other company has implemented such a comprehensive and continuous overhaul. We are incredibly proud of our team and will continue to emphasize transparency across all Fox News Media.'", "description": "The Fox News non-disclosure agreement did not stop Juliet Huddy however, who shared her story with screenwriter Charles Randolph.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/17/20389316-0-image-a-11_1572458140870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
