In a motion asking the judge to modify Mr. Zadeh\u2019s conditions of release, so that he could speak at conferences in Malaysia, Taiwan, Canada and France, Mr. Zadeh\u2019s lawyers said that he had also lost three book contracts. (Most of the parents have been barred from leaving the country.)\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Mr. Zadeh and his wife struggled to come up with the $100,000 they had agreed to pay as part of the arrangement, with Mr. Zadeh\u2019s wife saying at one point that they were refinancing their house to make the payments.\n\nProsecutors have accused Gregory Colburn, a radiation oncologist in Palo Alto, Calif., and his wife, Amy, of conspiring with Mr. Singer to cheat on their son\u2019s SAT exam. One of their lawyers, Patric Hooper, said this week that Dr. Colburn\u2019s career had been severely damaged because of a chain of consequences that result when a doctor is charged with a crime.\n\nAlready, he said, a state licensing board had begun an investigation of Dr. Colburn. Dr. Colburn had to notify Medicare and Medicaid that he was under investigation \u2014 and they could suspend him if they chose to, Mr. Hooper said, which would make it very difficult to practice. He has also had to notify the hospitals where he is on the medical staff.\n\n\u201cHis reputation is destroyed before he\u2019s even given an opportunity to defend himself,\u201d Mr. Hooper said.", "description": "Some of the 33 parents who are charged in the college admissions scandal have lost jobs, had book contracts canceled and television shows scrapped.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/us/03parents01-subalt/03parents01-subalt-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-03"}
