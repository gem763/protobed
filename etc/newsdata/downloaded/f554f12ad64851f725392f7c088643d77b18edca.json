(Photo by Milos Bicanski, Getty Images)\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has again cut the official interest rate at its October meeting, in line with consensus.\n\nMore than three in four economists, including all of the big four banks, had anticipated the cut from 1% to 0.75%, after a month of data indicated that weakness remains in the Australian economy.\n\nAs the unemployment rate refuses to move lower, wage growth \u2014 one of the RBA\u2019s key concerns \u2014 looks a long way off. Without it spending growth, and a stronger economy, as a result, looks unlikely to manifest.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut the official cash rate once again at its October meeting on Tuesday.\n\nThe RBA was widely expected to cut the interest rate from 1% to 0.75% in a further effort to support the ailing Australian economy and offset overseas risks.\n\n\u201cWhile the outlook for the global economy remains reasonable, the risks are tilted to the downside,\u201d RBA governor Philip Lowe said in his statement from the October meeting.\n\n\u201cThe US\u2013China trade and technology disputes are affecting international trade flows and investment as businesses scale back spending plans because of the increased uncertainty. At the same time, in most advanced economies, unemployment rates are low and wages growth has picked up, although inflation remains low.\u201d\n\nMore importantly and closer to home, growth in the Australian economy has been anemic.\n\n\u201cThe Australian economy expanded by 1.4 per cent over the year to the June quarter, which was a weaker-than-expected outcome,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the long-held expectation of the RBA that stimulus will support higher levels of growth. In Tuesday\u2019s statement, the RBA maintained its optimistic tone.\n\n\u201cThe low level of interest rates, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilisation in some established housing markets and a brighter outlook for the resources sector should all support growth,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nThat expectation has repeatedly been frustrated by rising unemployment \u2014 despite strong job creation \u2014 sluggish wage growth and the refusal of the Australian government to increase its own spending.\n\n\u201cThe main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption, with the sustained period of only modest increases in household disposable income continuing to weigh on consumer spending,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nREAD MORE: The Australian economy is set for its worst year since the 1991 recession \u2014 but don\u2019t expect any Rudd-style cash handouts under this government\n\nREAD MORE: Australian unemployment has just shot up to a 12 month high \u2013 and it\u2019s the \u2018smoking gun\u2019 the RBA needed to cut rates\n\nIt marks the third cut this year after it began slashing rates in June. The 0.25% cut on Tuesday brings the official interest rate to 0.75%, half of the 1.5% it was at in May \u2014 a level at which it had sat for more than two years.\n\nMore than three-quarters of economists, including all of the big four banks, told Bloomberg before the decision that they anticipated a cut. The remainder had expected the RBA to keep rates on hold until at least November.\n\nFor the RBA\u2019s part, it hinted in its statement on Tuesday that more cuts could be on the way.\n\n\u201cThe Board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nThe majority of economists look for a cut from the #RBA next week bringing the cash rate to 0.75%, according to the @BloombergAU survey \u2013 curiously a follow up cut isn\u2019t consensus until February, for mine if the RBA goes in October it should go in November as well #ausbiz pic.twitter.com/K4AYoYGxXF \u2014 Alex Joiner (@IFM_Economist) September 27, 2019\n\nThe consensus view has been that the RBA will cut again in February to bring the official cash rate to just 0.5%. IFM chief economist Alex Joiner, however, predicts another cut will follow in November at the RBA\u2019s next meeting.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
