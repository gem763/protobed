Sullivan had also been under consideration to be Trump's national security adviser, a role that ultimately ended up going to Robert O'Brien, the former U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs.\n\nSullivan will replace Jon Huntsman, who resigned in August after two years in the post, amid speculation that he will run for Utah governor.\n\nSullivan has been a career public servant since 1990, with posts in Ukraine, the U.S. mission to the European Union, South Korea and Honduras.\n\nMoscow has come under fire from Washington most recently because U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections. Russia has denied wrongdoing.
