(Streeter Lecka/Getty)\n\nEven though Rory McIlroy is ranked No. 2 in the world, Brooks Koepka, the top-ranked golfer in the world, says he doesn\u2019t view him as a rival.\n\nSpeaking to the AFP, the 29-year-old golfer said he doesn\u2019t view McIlroy as his rival because the Northern Irishman hasn\u2019t won a major in the five years since Koepka joined the PGA Tour.\n\nBoth golfers have four major wins on the tour with McIlroy\u2019s last major victory coming at the 2014 PGA Championship and Koepka\u2019s coming at the PGA Championship in May.\n\nThough he didn\u2019t win a major this season, McIlroy, 30, won the FedEx Cup for a second time and was named the PGA Tour player of the year. Tiger Woods is the only golfer besides McIlroy to win the season-long FedEx Cup race more than once.\n\nDespite that, Koepka maintains that the two are not rivals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking at anybody behind me,\u201d Koepka told AFP. \u201cI\u2019m number one in the world. I\u2019ve got open road in front of me I\u2019m not looking in the rearview mirror, so I don\u2019t see it as a rivalry. You know if the fans do (call it a rivalry), then that\u2019s on them and it could be fun. Look I love Rory he\u2019s a great player and he\u2019s fun to watch, but it\u2019s just hard to believe there\u2019s a rivalry in golf. I just don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Koepka has made similar comments about Woods.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at AFP", "description": "The 29-year-old said he doesn't view McIlroy as a rival because the Northern Irishman hasn't won a major in the five years since Koepka joined\u00a0the PGA Tour.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1170170658-e1571245627516.jpg?fit=768%2C512", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
