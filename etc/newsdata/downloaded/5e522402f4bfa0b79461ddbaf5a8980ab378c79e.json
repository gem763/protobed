All guests were taken out of the hotel while the military operation was underway.\n\nThe Baluchistan Liberation Army, a group fighting for greater autonomy in Pakistan's poorest province, claimed responsibility.\n\nGwadar is a strategic port on the Arabian Sea that is being developed as part of the 53 billion euro China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is itself part of China's mammoth Belt and Road infrastructure project.\n\nThe hotel, located on a hillside near the port, is used by foreign guests, including Chinese project staff, but there were none in the building at the time of the attack, said Langove.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan issued a statement condemning the attack.\n\n\"Such attempts, especially in Balochistan are an effort to sabotage our economic projects and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nPakistani officials have said the security forces were on alert for attacks during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which began in early May.\n\nSecurity across most of Pakistan has improved over recent years following a major crackdown after the country's worst attack, when some 150 people, most of them children, were killed in an attack on a school in the western city of Peshawar in 2014.\n\nBut Baluchistan, Pakistan's largest province, remains an exception and there have been several attacks this year, with at least 14 people killed last month in an attack on buses travelling between the southern city of Karachi and Gwadar.", "description": "One hotel guard is reported head as the Baluchistan Liberation Army claims responsibility.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/88/47/86/1000x563_cmsv2_18590f3a-4136-5531-a484-6065eefec894-3884786.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-11"}
