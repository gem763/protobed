In fact, he\u2019s never really had the option.\n\nFrom birth, Lamson has been a fighter because of an intestinal birth defect. Lamson spent three months in the neonatal care center before he was finally allowed to go home.\n\nBorn and raised in Flint, Mich., it\u2019s natural Lamson chose the career path that he did. One of the toughest cities in the U.S., Flint\u2019s issues extend far beyond its nationally publicized water crisis.\n\nA self-described troubled youth, Lamson said it was never his M.O. to be \u201cthe bully.\u201d Being \u201cthe white kid in Flint,\u201d Lamson was hardened by the difficulties the city presented. Unlike other poor cities who\u2019s slang monikers are flaunted by those representing, Lamson says Flint isn\u2019t a place many people are very proud to call home.\n\n\u201cFlint definitely played a big role in my upbringing in life,\u201d Lamson told MMA Junkie. \u201cBeing a kid from Flint, nothing is given to you there. A lot of places that have stereotypes against them like that.\n\n\u201cPeople from Flint are a little bit different. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re from Atlanta or Stockton or Detroit, people are really outgoing to tell you, \u2018Man, I\u2019m from Detroit. My place is hood.\u2019 I feel like Flint is not really like that. We\u2019re reserved. Yeah, it\u2019s a tough-ass place, but it\u2019s not something people are really happy about like other towns are.\u201d\n\nBred into a family of boxers, it wasn\u2019t long before Lamson was putting on the gloves. While originally rooted in wrestling, Lamson always loved the idea of professional fighting. He began fighting competitively as early as high school, taking a handful of amateur MMA bouts..\n\nAround the time he started competing in MMA, Lamson also became interested in tattoos. When his high school history class began teaching a unit on tribal people, Lamson was fascinated by their markings. It wasn\u2019t long before he was getting some of his own.\n\n\u201cWe were learning about these tribal people that would go to war and they\u2019d paint these tribal markings all over their body,\u201d Lamson said. \u201cThey thought humans were meant for war. That was the same time that I was deciding I didn\u2019t want to play football; I didn\u2019t want to go to college for stuff. I wanted to be a fighter from here on out.\n\n\u201c\u2026 So I was like, \u2018Dude, if you\u2019re really going to pick this, you need to let yourself know you\u2019re going to wake up everyday and you\u2019re a warrior. That\u2019s just what it is.'\u201d\n\nDespite aspirations to be a fighter, Lamson decided to put fighting on the back-burner. After all, it\u2019s not everyday you get the opportunity to wrestle at Michigan State University like Lamson did.\n\n\u201cI worked out a really good plan with them, because college wrestling meant not turning pro for 4-5 years,\u201d Lamson said. \u201cThat was a big deal for me. But there was no way I was passing up a scholarship to a Division I university. That was something I simply couldn\u2019t do. I ended up going there, and between all of my wrestling summers when we\u2019d have offseason, I\u2019d start training MMA, and I\u2019d take fights. I was 17-0 as an amateur and when I graduated, I turned pro.\u201d\n\nIn college, Lamson began to realize his intestinal issues were a blessing in disguise. Having one third less of a lower intestine than the average person meant Lamson\u2019s metabolism was faster than everyone else.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I basically hit the cheat code when I was a little kid,\u201d Lamson said. \u201c\u2026 My metabolism is literally stuck on fast. I remember when I hurt my hand when I was in college wrestling. All I could eat was cafeteria food and boozing and eating. I ended up losing like 6 or 7 pounds.\n\n\u201cPeople were like, \u2018How the hell are you losing weight?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Because I\u2019m not working out.\u2019 My dad and brother are both 6-foot, 200-and-something pounds, and I\u2019m Mr. String Bean.\u201d\n\nNow 15 fights into his professional career, Lamson is on the doorstep of the UFC. On Saturday, Lamson (13-2 MMA), 27, will take on Team Alpha Male wrestling coach Alex Munoz (5-0 MMA) in a lightweight bout at Trinity Kings 8 in Honolulu. The event will stream on UFC Fight Pass and is to be featured on an upcoming episode of \u201cDana White: Lookin\u2019 for a Fight.\u201d\n\nBeing a 6-foot-1 lightweight with legitimate wrestling experience, Lamson sees himself as a very dangerous addition to the UFC\u2019s 155-pound roster.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a tall, long fighter,\u201d Lamson said. \u201cBut tell me this: When was the last time the tallest person in the division had Division I college wrestling? How do you beat a tall wrestler? You either get inside and get taken down, or you stay on the outside and try to strike with the tallest guy in your division.\u201d\n\nFlint\u2019s water crisis is something that truly bothers Lamson. Despite the awareness, a lot of issues are still prevalent. Like anyone from Flint, Lamson has been touched by the issue and is fed up with the nonsense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably going to have cancer at 55 from that (expletive),\u201d Lamson said. \u201cThankfully, I grew up in a house that had a well. But I drank the Flint city water. That\u2019s what they served at football practice. That\u2019s what I drank in the schools. Just because it went real bad when I was in college doesn\u2019t mean the whole time it wasn\u2019t in severe levels.\n\n\u201cI still have friends that that still directly impacts their life. They still have to go down to the water stations and get bottles of water, or they have to boil the water before they use it. I remember when it first happened, I had a fellow fighter from Flint who had a nephew or a baby that died in a bath from the water being so contaminated that the little kid actually died.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cPeople are drinking that Flint River water and still, to this day, it\u2019s just not right. It\u2019s wild. When my career ends, I hope I can go back there to Flint and help do it right. They\u2019ve been running that place into the ground for a minute now.\u201d\n\nLamson envisions himself having a long, successful career in the UFC. In doing so, he hopes to help fix the seemingly never-ending issues in his hometown. \u201cPretty Boy\u201d made it clear any help he\u2019ll give isn\u2019t because he has to. Flint never gave him anything, so he doesn\u2019t feel like he has any favors to return. Anything he plans on doing is going to be done because he wants to.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think I owe (expletive) to Flint,\u201d Lamson said. \u201cFlint hasn\u2019t done anything to me. I have respect for the city and stuff and yeah, I want to give back to it. Not because I feel like I owe it, but because it\u2019s something you grow up with and come to respect.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to be the person who did it because they had to. I want to do it because I chose to. It definitely impacted me 100 percent. People know about Flint for a reason.\u201d\n\nAn overachiever, a Michigan State wrestler, a top regional prospect \u2013 these aren\u2019t the only hats Lamson wears. He\u2019s a member of the coveted Hard Knocks 365 camp in South Florida, a friend of Rashad Evans, and a part time model. All of Lamson\u2019s life details have primed him to become a star.\n\n\u201cFans should watch me fight because, first of all, I\u2019m an extremely good looking man,\u201d Lamson said. \u201cSecondly, I have the best tattoos in mixed martial arts. Thirdly, I bring a swagger to the cage that introduces itself into the fight.\n\n\u201cBut when you see somebody, you can tell when something is fake and the game is not right. When Kobe is trying to do some stuff, you can tell some of it\u2019s real, but some of it is fake. It\u2019s just me \u2013 it\u2019s just me.\u201d", "description": "Born and raised in Michigan, this UFC hopeful's journey to top prospect notoriety wasn't easy.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Christian Stein", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/troy.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
