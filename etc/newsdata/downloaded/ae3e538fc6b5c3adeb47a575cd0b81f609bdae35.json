I can play with the rest of it!'\"\n\nOverall, the Knoxville, Tennessee, native says \"there's just a lot going on\" sonically on her third record.\n\n\"There's a lot more country,\" she explains. \"There's also a lot more country pop. We have a song with horns, we have a song with a string quartet. We have two collaborations.\"\n\nBallerini expects that ultimately, this album will be very different than her last one.\n\n\"'Unapologetically' was a concept record -- top to bottom, if you listened to it, it told a story,\" she explains. \"This is opposite of that. It's quite liberating -- this one's just like, 'Here you go, try and figure this out!'\"", "description": "It sounds like we may have to wait a bit longer for more new music from the", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/kelsea-ballerini-file-gty-jef-190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
