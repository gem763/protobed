The figure is up 66% from the prior fiscal year but lower than the $84.3 million Nadella received in the 2014 fiscal year, when he took over from Steve Ballmer.\n\nNadella's pay bump highlights Microsoft's turnaround under his leadership, as it's doubled down on cloud services. A year ago Microsoft took back from Apple the title of most valuable public company in the world; on Wednesday its market capitalization exceeded $1.07 trillion.\n\nNadella received a $1 million base salary bump, and an increase in stock awards. In reviewing his equity compensation Microsoft's independent directors pointed to \"Mr. Nadella's strategic leadership, including his efforts to strengthen trust with customers, drive for a company-wide culture change, and successful entry and expansion into new technologies and markets.\"\n\nThe independent directors also cited the growth of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud business, which includes the Azure cloud that competes with Amazon Web Services. Intelligent Cloud was the largest of Microsoft's three segments for the first time in more than three years in the most recent quarter.\n\nMicrosoft in the 2019 fiscal year continued to exceed several key targets, including LinkedIn sessions, revenue from Commercial Cloud services and Windows 10 monthly active devices. And in the fiscal year Nadella received part of a long-term performance-based stock award.\n\n\"During the first five-year performance period, Microsoft's market capitalization increased $509 billion (from $302 billion to $811 billion), and Microsoft's relative TSR was in the 97th percentile, resulting in Mr. Nadella earning and vesting in the maximum 900,000 shares,\" Microsoft said in the filing.\n\nWATCH: Satya Nadella has been tactically more impressive than Apple CEO Tim Cook, says portfolio manager", "description": "The Microsoft CEO was paid $42.9 million for the 2019 fiscal year, which ended on June 30.
