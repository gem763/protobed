Professional runners are actually breaking records in the shoes quite frequently, which has sparked a controversial debate amongst the running community.\n\nThe Vaporfly range originally made headlines for its inclusion of a full-length carbon fiber plate embedded in its foam midsole, which was put in place to increase propulsion. The more recent ZoomX Vaporfly Next% kept the carbon fiber plate in place, as well as added a more breathable material, extra foam, redesigned track pattern and a foam pod for Achilles support. The pair retails for around $250 USD.\n\nAccording to The Times, since the Vaporfly\u2019s initial launch back in 2016, \u201cDennis Kimetto\u2019s 2014 world record of 2:2:57 has been bettered on five occasions, each time by an athlete wearing the shoe.\u201d In addition, Eliud Kipchoge wore a special prototype of the Vaporfly when he became the first person to run a sub-two-hour marathon, and so did Brigid Kosgei when she broke the women\u2019s world record the next day. \u201cNormally I don\u2019t like to fall for marketing stuff,\u201d performance coach for professional runners Steve Magness told The Washington Post, \u201cbut if you look at the research and data, the shoes seem to have a big effect.\u201d\n\nAs a result, many professional athletes have reportedly complained to the IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) and the Athletics Integrity Unit in hopes that the organizations will examine the shoes to determine if they are providing runners with an unfair advantage. The IAAF recently issued a statement to The Times acknowledging the issue. \u201cRecent advances in technology mean that the concept of \u2018assistance\u2019 to athletes\u2026 has been the subject of much debate in the athletics world,\u201d said the statement. \u201cThe IAAF has established a working group to consider the issues.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in footwear news, Pharrell Williams has a potential adidas 4D runner on the way.", "description": "IAAF to Investigate Nike's ZoomX Vaporfly Following Multiple Broken Records: Professional runners claim the shoes provide an unfair advantage.", "authors": ["Emily Engle", "Hb Team"], "top_image": "https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2019%2F10%2Fnike-zoomx-vaporly-marathon-controversy-twfb2.jpg?w=960&cbr=1&q=90&fit=max", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
