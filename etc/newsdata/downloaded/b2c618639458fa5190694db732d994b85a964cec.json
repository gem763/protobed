Clearly, the people responsible for installation and the accompanying security personnel would have similar access to the images captured on the cameras on a 24-hour basis.\u201d\n\nShe alleged that Strydom intimidated and harassed her \u201cemotionally, verbally, psychologically and economically\u201d.\n\nShe argued that her constitutional rights to privacy and human dignity were being infringed by the cameras, adding that there was no reason she should suffer \u201congoing bullying\u201d.\n\nShe said she could not do normal things in the house without being seen by her husband or the security personnel. \u201cFor example, I cannot be by the swimming pool or lie in the sun. I will not leave my room in my pyjamas or underwear to go and fetch something in the washing room or kitchen.\u201d\n\nStrydom opposed the court application.\n\nHe said in court papers that he had no intention of spying on her through cameras.\n\nIf, for example, he wanted to look at her swimming, he could do so in person, \u201calthough he tries to have as little contact with her as possible\u201d, stated the court papers.\n\nHe said he installed the cameras because Nikolie was persistently careless in not locking the house.\n\nThe conflict broke new ground when Nikolie allegedly sprayed multi-surface polish Mr Min on the cameras, causing financial damage for Strydom.\n\nHe said that Nikolie had no regard for safety.\n\n\u201cDespite my frequent requests, she refuses to lock the doors and turn the alarm system on.\u201d\n\nStrydom denied that they lived in a safe area.\n\n\u201cIt has become increasingly unsafe, to the point that even our neighbours installed cameras.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that various documents and items had recently disappeared from his study.\n\nNikolie denied removing them, so this made him more fearful that someone was entering their home when they were not present.\n\nStrydom said there were no cameras in the bedrooms or bathrooms, only in the communal areas inside or outside the house. He also denied ever having abused Nikolie, saying: \u201cIn actual fact, she is the one that assaulted me.\u201d\n\nNikolie had provided no evidence that she had been abused, he added.\n\nThe \u201cproblem\u201d was that she assaulted and verbally abused him, and did not want this behaviour recorded, he said.", "description": "Former Springbok lock Hannes Strydom and his wife, Nikolie (both 54), still live together in their Waterkloof home but no longer share a bedroom.", "authors": ["Jeanne-Mari\u00e9 Versluis"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7979/5a7f952686e64571ac2bfacc10447bd4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
