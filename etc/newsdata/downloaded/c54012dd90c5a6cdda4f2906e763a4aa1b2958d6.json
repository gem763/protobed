Warren and Sanders were about even for second, with 19 percent and 16 percent, respectively.", "description": "US Congressman Tim Ryan announced on Thursday that he's ending his presidential campaign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/25/5db1fc2ba310cf3e97a2d9d0.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
