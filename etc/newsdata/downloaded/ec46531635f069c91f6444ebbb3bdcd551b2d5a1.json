The chair of the Federal Reserve has been signaling that, while growth is slowing, there is no recession risk and the Fed is forecasting continued positive growth. Warning signs in the economy, including an inverted yield curve, have been ignored and stock markets continued to make new highs in July. In August a correction took a place and subsequently a rally ensued into early September. On September 18 the Fed is expected to cut rates.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about this? This is hardly news. Except that this paragraph would be as true for the U.S. economy and stock market in September 2007 as it is today. Consider that 12 years ago the yield curve was inverted and U.S. economic growth was markedly slower than it had been in 2006. Yet the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 SPX, +0.26% made a new high in July 2007 (same as 2019), there was an August correction (same as 2019), and then the Fed cut rates on September 18 (ditto \u2014 same day even).\n\nU.S. stocks proceeded to make another marginal high that October \u2014 and that was it. Lights out. We all know what happened next.\n\nIt seems we are at a curious moment in time. Parallels to late 2007 are running through the markets now. This doesn\u2019t mean the market\u2019s fate will play out as it did then, but the ingredients are there and all that\u2019s needed is a trigger. Perhaps the trigger was the attack on Saudi oil installations last weekend. It\u2019s too early to tell, but clearly this is something to keep in mind.\n\nMarkets topped in October 2007 following the Fed\u2019s September rate cut. That November, Ben Bernanke, then Fed chair, said there wouldn\u2019t be a recession. According to a November 2007 Reuters report, Bernanke told a congressional committee: \u201cOur assessment is for slower growth, but positive growth, going into next year.\u201d The U.S. economy entered recession in December 2007.\n\nBernanke November 2007:\n\n\"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told lawmakers on Thursday the U.S. economy did not appear headed for recession.\n\nOur assessment is for slower growth, but positive growth, going into next year\u201d\n\n\n\nRecession starts December 2007https://t.co/icu7dY0XW3 \u2014 Sven Henrich (@NorthmanTrader) September 16, 2019\n\nDoes this not sound eerily similar to what Fed Chairman Jay Powell has been saying? Here\u2019s Powell on September 6: \u201cWe\u2019re not forecasting or expecting a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most likely outlook is still moderate growth, a strong labor market and inflation continuing to move back up.Our main expectation is not at all that there will be a recession.\u201d\n\nPowell September 6:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not forecasting or expecting a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most likely outlook is still moderate growth\u201d\n\n\u201cOur main expectation is not at all that there will be a recession,\u201d Powell said.\u201dhttps://t.co/y9qq1jczvq \u2014 Sven Henrich (@NorthmanTrader) September 16, 2019\n\nSure, there are differences between now and 2007, and of course no two time periods are alike, but the confluence of circumstances is impressive. Markets now are behaving in highly correlated ways with 2007, and the Federal Reserve seems to be behaving similarly as well.\n\nRead: The S&P 500 should be 13% lower because a recession is coming\n\nWhat does all of this suggest?\n\nFor starters, the Fed will not tell you when a recession starts. They can and will be in total denial until after the fact. The 2007 recession began one month after Bernanke stated in front of Congress that there wouldn\u2019t be a recession. So when Powell makes the same declaration as the Fed cuts rates again, know that such a statement has absolutely no meaning. \u201cNot forecasting or expecting a recession\u201d he stated on September 6. Is this Powell\u2019s Bernanke moment?\n\nTo avoid the same fate, markets now need to make sustained new highs or risk seeing similar circumstances to 2007 play out in similar ways.\n\nSven Henrich is founder and the lead market strategist of NorthmanTrader.com.
