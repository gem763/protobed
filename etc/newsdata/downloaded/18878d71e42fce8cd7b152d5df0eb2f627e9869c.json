It was the largest comeback win in the ninth inning in history for the Nationals, who moved to Washington in 2005.\n\nThe Nationals scored seven runs in the last of the ninth, with two coming on a bases-loaded double by pinch-hitter Ryan Zimmerman.\n\nWashington had lost 11 of the previous 17 games to the Mets this year, including a 7-3 drubbing on Monday.\n\nThe comeback helped overshadow a discouraging start by Max Scherzer, who gave up four runs in his third outing since coming off the injured list.\n\nJoe Panik hit just his fourth homer of the year, a two-run shot in the fourth, off Scherzer before a crowd of just 20,759 fans.\n\nWashington (78-61) is 6\u00bd games back of first-place Atlanta in the National League East.\n\nThe Mets (70-68) saw their playoff chances take a big hit against Washington, whose bullpen struggled before the huge comeback.\n\nScherzer was making his third start since coming off the injured list. He went six innings and allowed four runs on five hits with seven strikeouts while throwing 90 pitches.\n\nThe previous three homers he allowed came to batters with just a combined 19 homers before play began Wednesday: Garrett Hampson (3) of Colorado, Adam Frazier (8) of Pittsburgh and Chance Cisco (8) of Baltimore.\n\nFormer Washington catcher Wilson Ramos had an RBI double and Brandon Nimmo drove in a run with a sacrifice fly as the Mets tied the game at 2 in the fourth.\n\nLater in the inning, Panik hit a two-run homer to right off Scherzer to make it 4-1.\n\nThe Mets had four hits on first pitches from Scherzer in the fourth inning. According to SNYtv, opponents had just 12 such hits off the ace in his previous 22 starts in 2019.\n\nJacob deGrom, the Mets starter, gave up a two-run homer to Juan Soto that trimmed the margin to 5-4 in the eighth. Seth Lugo took over for deGrom, who gave up four runs in seven innings. Washington left fielder Soto was hit near the right elbow in the sixth inning by deGrom but stayed in the game.\n\nBut Brandon Nimmo of the Mets led off the ninth with a homer off Roenis Elias to make it 6-4. New York scored five more in the ninth, with Pete Alonso hitting a homer off Daniel Hudson.\n\nThe Nationals rallied, with Edwin Diaz of the Mets giving up the winning homer to Suzuki.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
