But these days, most companies offer monthly instalment plans to allow users to pay off the investment over anything up to 15 or even 25 years.\n\n\u201cMany customers feel that the pride and peace of mind of solar \u2018pays for itself\u2019 as soon as the system powers on, and they can remotely monitor and adjust their system on their smart phone app,\u201d said Lombard.\n\nThese are the key components to move your house over to solar energy:\n\nSolar panels\n\nAs a rough guide, a 1 kilowatt (kW) solar array takes up about 8m2 of space on your roof. This can produce about 3-5 kilowatts hours of energy (kWh) per day depending on the angle and direction the panels face. Solar panels are typically installed facing north in South Africa, in order to maximise exposure to the sun\u2019s rays.\n\nYou will need to replace today's panels every 25 to 40 years.\n\nBattery storage\n\nKey to going off the grid is a battery storage unit. Newer battery types have been able to push the limits to improve storage for longer periods as well as stand up to more recharges before running out of steam, two of the major problems with home installations to date.\n\n\u201cLithium batteries need replacing every 8 to 10 years, especially in hotter parts of our country. Typical solar deep cycle batteries like lead, calcium or other AGM [absorbed glass mat] batteries only provide 1,500 to 2,500 recharges. These \u2018old school\u2019 batteries require replacing every 3 to 5 years,\u201d said Lombard.\n\nInverter and/or charge controller\n\nBatteries produce output power in direct current (DC) form, which can run at very low voltages but cannot be used to run most modern household appliances. Utility companies and generators produce sine wave alternating current (AC) power, which is used by most commonly available appliances today. Inverters take the DC power supplied by a storage battery bank and convert it to AC power.\n\nYou can expect your inverter and/or charge controller to have 10 to 15 years of operation.\n\nWe asked 3 companies to give us cost estimates, based on some typical home installations. Here's how they stacked up.\n\nBusiness Insider approached a wide array of the many providers of home solar systems in South Africa. Some said they were too busy to deal with vague enquiries, and others never responded.\n\nThose who got back to us offered different types of hardware and services that affected their pricing. In addition, each home is slightly different, and every family have slightly different power requirements, all of which will influence the system they use.\n\nNonetheless, the three companies that gave us broad-stroke proposals give some idea of the range you can expect to pay to take a home off the grid right now: between R150,000 and R350,000.\n\nHere's what each of the three companies quoted us.\n\nRegenergy\n\n2 person home using 15kWh/day - R152,000\n\n4 person home using 25kWh/day - R270,600\n\n5 person home using +35kWh/day \u2013 R359, 790\n\nSolarConnect\n\n10kW (29 - 46kWh) average 4 bedroom home - R215,000\n\n15kW (75kW) 5+ bedroom - R240, 000\n\nZeroth\n\n10kW 2-4 bedroom home - R249,669 (excluding Vat)\n\n15kW 5 + bedroom home - R349,669 (excluding Vat)\n\nIf you feel that a full off-the-grid solution is too much, there are also other options. Bj\u00f6rn Potgieter of SolarConnect, says they can provide a grid back up system using solar electricity for R120,000 of for R49,500 a basic back up that excludes powering stove, geysers, air conditioning.\n\nThis story has been updated to include the latest load shedding developments.\n\nFor more, go to Business Insider South Africa.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The price of electricity keeps going up in South Africa, and the price of home solar installations keep going down.
