But he still think's \"it's a real company.\"\n\nWeWork has had a tumultuous past few months as it tried to go public.\n\nThe office-sharing company revealed a $900 million loss in its prospectus; pulled its initial public offering after concerns about a falling valuation and its corporate governance structure; and fired its CEO and top stakeholder Adam Neumann.\n\nWithout additional funding, WeWork will likely run out of cash by mid-November.\n\n\"It was built for hypergrowth and that is too capital intensive,\" said Sternlicht, who in 1991 co-founded Starwood Capital, which created Starwood Hotels, now part of Marriott, as well as other leisure brands. \"You have to build steady growth, not hypergrowth.\"\n\nSternlicht in the past had a negative outlook on WeWork before becoming bullish on the company. \"I'm conflicted on this,\" he said, when asked about his current view. He would only say \"we're involved\" and declined to comment any further.\n\nFacing a cash crunch, WeWork's biggest outside shareholder, SoftBank, and J.P. Morgan, which was supposed to lead the IPO, are working to put together a financial rescue package, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nSternlicht added that WeWork needs to cut its overhead significantly in order to turn itself around. \"You have to reshape the company,\" he said. \"If you cut the overhead there's a profitable business at some level.\"\n\nA spokesperson for WeWork was not immediately available to respond to CNBC's request for comment on Sternlicht's statements.", "description": "\"It was built for hyper growth and that is too capital intensive,\" says the Starwood Capital founder.", "authors": ["Jessica Bursztynsky"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103789445-GettyImages-479699835.jpg?v=1571402919", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
