But to me and tens of millions of Americans, America is about \"yearning to breathe free.\"\n\nCuccinelli explained to Burnett, who ignored him, that the first immigration law excluding those who would likely become a public charge was passed in 1882, the year before Emma Lazarus wrote \"The New Colossus.\"\n\nImmigration is just part of the larger discussion dividing us so deeply today. Is \"freedom\" what primarily defines our nation, or is it welfare and redistribution of income?\n\nAnd if it's \"freedom,\" what does this mean?\n\nHere is the great free market economist and Nobel laureate Milton Friedman: \"Why is it that free immigration was a good thing before 1914\" -- according to popular opinion -- \"and free immigration is a bad thing today? ... Because it is one thing to have free immigration to jobs. It is another thing to have free immigration to welfare. And you cannot have both.\"\n\n\"If you have a welfare state,\" continues Friedman, \"in which every ... resident is promised some minimal level of income ... whether he works or not, produces it or not, well, then it really is an impossible thing\" to have free immigration.\n\nIn 1900, three years before Emma Lazarus' poem was posted on the Statue of Liberty, 2.8% of the nation's gross domestic product was taken by the federal government. Today it is 23.2%, almost one quarter of our nation's economy taken and largely redistributed by the federal government.\n\nThose immigrating to the United States in 1903, when \"The New Colossus\" appeared on the State of Liberty, were the \"tired ... poor ... huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\" What America offered them was freedom, work, opportunity.\n\nThey came, learned the language, became part of the country and its culture, and participated in building the great and prosperous nation that America was to become in the 20th century.\n\nIt's not to say that many who aspire to come to America today are not motivated by these things. But because welfare is so available now, in contrast to 1903, we must be careful. Not only is it costly to us but, despite the claims of progressives, rarely is it compassionate. I know from personal experience we should be offering those escaping oppression a free life, not more government.\n\nIt is simple prudence to make sure that new arrivals to the country become producers and taxpayers rather than consumers of government benefits. The Congressional Budget Office has just sounded its latest alarm that the national debt burden is headed to \"unprecedented levels,\" posing \"substantial risks\" to the nation.\n\nI wish these media hosts trying to get such mileage from \"The New Colossus\" were equally anxious to look for faithfulness to other songs and poems that are part of our national culture.\n\nSongs like the one composed in 1918 by Jewish immigrant Irving Berlin, with the words:\n\n\"God Bless America,\n\n\"Land that I love.\n\n\"Stand beside her,\n\n\"And guide her,\n\n\"Through the night with a light from above.\"\n\nStar Parker is an author and president of CURE, Center for Urban Renewal and Education.", "description": "The left-wing media is having a field day distorting acting .09/04/2019 0:09:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Star Parker", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2011/130/651c85e0-05d9-440e-af73-ca1e56530548@news.ap.org.jpg"}
