You can\u2019t really take what he says too serious.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilder has his own fight to contend with before his 22 February clash with Fury. A rematch with Luis Ortiz is scheduled for 23 November in Las Vegas.\n\nFury, clearly unimpressed with Wilder\u2019s latest comments, pointed to the American\u2019s upcoming fight as the bigger danger to their rematch than his appearance in WWE.\n\n\u2018Doesn\u2019t Deontay Wilder have to take care of business in November?,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018He should\u2019t be concentrating on what I\u2019m doing. He should be concentrating on what he\u2019s doing.\n\nWilder fights Ortiz in their rematch at the end of November (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018Win that fight first. People always make the mistake of looking at the next opponent \u2013 bigger paydays and bigger profiles.\n\n\u2018Many people have looked past the actual event to bigger events and come unstuck in the smaller hurdles.\n\n\u2018My advice to Deontay would be win against Luis Ortiz and then we\u2019ll see where we go from there. If he loses against Ortiz then the fight with me is out.\u2019\n\nOne heavyweight who was guilty of overlooking an opponent is Joshua. The former unified champion was knocked out by massive underdog Andy Ruiz Jr last June and will rematch the Mexican in December.\n\nWith so much riding on Joshua\u2019s do-over with Ruiz Jr, Fury warned Wilder not to make the same mistake his British rival did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018[Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder] all got their own business first before they can think about what I\u2019m doing,\u2019 Fury insisted.\n\nJoshua seeks revenge over Ruiz Jr in December (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Wilder\u2019s got Ortiz, Ruiz has got Joshua. There\u2019s no point in even talking about these men, but it\u2019s very uncertain in their future.\n\n\u2018He looked over Ruiz before and got knocked out. This is how much nothing is given in life.
