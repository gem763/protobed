Fury responded with a similar pose and a grin for good measure, before Strowman carried on his business. But Strowman quickly refocused on Fury by launching Ziggler into the barricade where he was standing, knocking Fury off-balance and back into his seat.\n\nFury reacted by jumping the guard rail and tried to enter the ring to get his hands on Strowman, only for a number of security guards to restrain him and prevent the clash from happening.\n\nWatch the video below...\n\nAnd while Fury is known to be one of the more unpredictable characters within boxing, it looks pretty obvious that this was a planned drama tasked to build up a future role for Fury in WWE.\n\nHe is not the first boxer to find himself crossing codes to the WWE, with Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather both previously making appearances in respective feuds against Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels, and The Big Show.\n\nBrock Lesnar has also made two successful careers out of swapping between WWE and MMA, with the former UFC heavyweight champion currently on the wrestling roster as one of their star attractions.\n\nLesnar claimed the WWE Championship by defeating Kofi Kingston to regain the title, only to then be confronted by another UFC star in Cain Velasquez - the man who defeated Lesnar to win the UFC Heavyweight Championship nine years ago at UFC 121. Velasquez walked out with WWE veteran Rey Mysterio - who earlier had been on the receiving end of a vicious attack by Lesnar, and Velasquez promptly took Lesnar down before throwing a number of punches at him in a famous rivalry renewed.\n\nWatch the video below...\n\nWhat the future holds for Fury though is anyone\u2019s guess, with the British fighter currently weighing up whether to wait for his rematch against Wilder of plan another contest before his world title shot.
