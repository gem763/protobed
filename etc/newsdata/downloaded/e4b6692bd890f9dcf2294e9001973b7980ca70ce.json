I was sluggish, I was stressed and I didn\u2019t really want to do anything.\n\n\u2018When I started training, I wasn\u2019t in the greatest place \u2013 I was trying to balance everything on my shoulders in my personal and professional life. I didn\u2019t enjoy \u201cme\u201d.\u2019\n\nNow that he\u2019s gained all that muscle, with his hair apparently leaving his body along with the extra weight, Shayne has converted straight back to the 2006 Breathless version of himself.\n\nWe all know post X Factor, Shayne singing cheesy break-up and make-up songs like No U Hang Up was what made us all first fall in love with him in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been 21 weeks and I\u2019m so far removed from that now,\u2019 he continued. \u2018I\u2019m so grateful for what U.P Fitness has offered me. It gives you a better focus \u2013 you can enjoy fitness.\n\nShayne was feeling self-conscious before (Picture: UP Fitness/Radioactive PR)\n\nStaring intensely into the mirror helps you gain muscles faster (Picture: UP Fitness/Radioactive PR)\n\nProps to his personal trainer for bringing back bald Shayne (Picture: UP Fitness/Radioactive PR)\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t just mean getting bulging biceps or a bigger chest, it means you can be a lot healthier in body and mind.\n\n\u2018My confidence is through the roof. People say \u201cyou look happier\u201d, \u201cyour confidence is so much better\u201d. I feel good, I feel fresh, I\u2019m not quite 21 anymore, but I\u2019m feeling really good.\u2019\n\nYou\u2019re only 35, Shayne, your body isn\u2019t shutting down just yet.\n\nThe Coronation Street actor impressively went from 29 per cent to 16 per cent body fat and now we\u2019re all just jealous of his commitment.\n\nShayne originally rose to fame after winning X Factor in 2005, and look at him now.\n\nNot only did Shayne get a British Soap award for the episode where his Corrie character Aidan Connor died by suicide, but he can sing and is now a beast in the gym.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s he up to next, then?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
