Here are five things you should know about the senator from Massachusetts. USA TODAY\n\nWhite House hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants to impose a massive tax on lobbying activities, creating a new levy that she hopes will nudge some of the nation\u2019s biggest companies and special interest groups toward curtailing federal lobbying.\n\n\u201cMy new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Boeing, and Comcast,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSure, this may mean that some corporations and industry groups will choose to reduce their lobbying expenditures, raising less tax revenue down the road \u2013 but in that case, all the better.\u201d\n\nThe proposal might face long odds \u2014 a seeming longshot in a divided Congress in which both sides of the aisle have deep ties to lobbyists \u2014 but it marks Warren\u2019s latest effort to press her case to voters that she\u2019s the candidate most in tune with looking out for working-class Americans. It also comes amidst growing angst in tech and financial sectors about her growing popularity in polls\n\nUnder the the Massachusetts senator's legislative proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million per year on lobbying Congress and federal agencies would pay a 35% tax on those expenditures.\n\nSen.

Under data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics, Warren\u2019s proposal would have resulted in companies such as Koch Industries, Pfizer, Boeing, Microsoft, Walmart, and Exxon being subject to the 75% rate for lobbying spending above $5 million in every year over the last decade.\n\nWarren in March unveiled a plan that called for regulators to roll back big tech mergers such as Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and Facebook purchasing the messaging platform WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nWarren then slammed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Tuesday after The Verge published leaked audio in which he lamented that if Warren were elected president Facebook would find itself caught in a legal battle with U.S. government.\n\nIn this file photo taken on September 19, 2019 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg walks to meetings for technology regulations and social media issues on Capitol Hill, in Washington, DC. - Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has pledged to \"go to the mat\" to fight a government attempt to break up the social media giant, according to a report on October 1, 2019 based on a leaked audio recording.Tech news site The Verge released leaked audio from a meeting of Facebook employees in July in which Zuckerberg said he would challenge a breakup effort, repeating his argument that splitting the company would not address issues raised by critics. (Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" Zuckerberg said in the audio that was among snippets from two meetings held with Facebook employees in July. \"And does that still suck for us? Yeah.\"\n\nBig tech clash: Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech\n\nMore: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders slam Big Tech but their campaigns spend heavily on them\n\nShe took to Twitter last week to push back against a CNBC report citing anonymous Democratic Wall Street donors who told the financial network they would sit out the election or support Trump in Warren becomes the nominee.\n\n\u201cI'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cI'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need.\u201d\n\nWarren has steadily climbed in the polls. She hovered in the single-digit percentages in most national and early voting states\u2019 polls early in the year. Two recent polls \u2014 one in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa and a national survey of voters \u2014 found her slightly ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nWhere would the money go\n\nWarren says revenue generated by her lobbying tax would be poured into a \u201cLobby Defense Trust Fund\u201d that would be used to reinstate the dormant Office of Technology Assessment and increase the budget for congressional support agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The senator said she\u2019d also push to have revenue used to fund a public advocate\u2019s office tasked with helping Americans \u201cengage with federal agencies and fight for the public interest in the rule-making process.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s plan also calls for using the money to bolster federal agencies that are being inundated by companies or industries lobbying against a rule.\n\nShe noted that having such a mechanism would have been helpful during the Obama administration when financial industry lobbyists successfully stymied the Department of Labor\u2019s proposed \u201cfiduciary rule,\u201d which would have limited brokers abilities to put fees and commissions ahead of earning returns for their clients\u2019 retirement accounts.\n\nAfter a public hearing on the rule, the agency received more than 100 comments \u2014including 45 from members of Congress \u2014 that seemed to repeat industry talking points. Under law, agencies much respond to all concerns laid out in the public comments; the Obama Labor Department ended up withdrawing the proposed rule amid the flood of comments.\n\n\u201cEvery time a company above the $500,000 threshold spends money lobbying against a rule from a federal agency, the taxes on that spending will go directly to the agency to help it fight back,\u201d Warren wrote of her proposal. \u201cIn 2010, DOL could have used that money to hire more staffers to complete the rule more quickly and intake the flood of industry comments opposing it.\u201d\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/02/elizabeth-warren-wants-massive-tax-lobbying-activities/3835109002/", "description": "Warren\u2019s proposal\u00a0 would have resulted in companies such as Pfizer, Microsoft, Walmart, and Exxon \u2013 being subject to a 75% rate for lobbying spending.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Published A.M.
