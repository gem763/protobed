Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Saturday accused President Donald Trump of engaging in \u201ctargeted antisemitism\u201d towards House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA).\n\n\u201cUnderstand that Trump is engaged in deliberate, atrocious, targeted antisemitism towards Chairman Schiff,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez proclaimed.\n\n\u201cThen ask yourself why no one cares to denounce it \u2013 esp when his accusation of it towards others drove full news cycles earlier this year,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s harmful,\u201d she continued, adding that Trump\u2019s purported \u201cbigotry\u201d is \u201creflective\u201d his \u201cwhite supremacist base.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s harmful. And his bigotry is reflective of the white supremacist base he relies on for political gain. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 5, 2019\n\nThe \u201cSquad\u201d ringleader tweeted an article from The Intercept, which bizarrely accused the president of launching antisemitic attacks against the notorious anti-Trump lawmaker, who is largely driving the partisan impeachment effort.\n\n\u201cOn October 2, Trump escalated his brazenly anti-Semitic attack on Schiff,\u201d The Intercept claimed before quoting Trump.\n\n\u201c\u2018We don\u2019t call him \u2018Shifty Schiff\u2019 for nothing,\u201d Trump said of Schiff, calling him a \u201cshifty, dishonest guy.\u201d\n\nSHIFTY SCHIFF DUPED BY RUSSIAN PRANKSTERS! pic.twitter.com/CpIL0b5FLW \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nThe outlet claimed that Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201cshifty\u201d is an antisemitic attack \u2013 suggesting that Jews are \u201csneaky and manipulative\u201d \u2013 rather than a simple play on his last name.\n\nThe outlet also accuses Donald Trump Jr. of being in on the \u201cattack,\u201d participating by linking Schiff to the notorious left-wing billionaire George Soros:\n\nAnd for those who don\u2019t know who Adam Schiff is, he is not just a radical liberal, he is someone who has been hand-picked and supported by George Soros. \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 2, 2019\n\nThe Intercept wrote:\n\nDon Jr.\u2019s tweets provoked a rare response from Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation League, who referred to his invocation of Soros, a left-leaning Jewish billionaire, as an \u201canti-Semitic trope\u201d and a \u201cdangerous\u201d insinuation.\n\nDespite The Intercept\u2019s claims, there is no evidence that Trump\u2019s critiques of Schiff are antisemitic in nature.\n\nSchiff is largely driving the Democrat impeachment effort alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). He remains a controversial figure, particularly following a week of bombshells.\n\nIt was revealed this week that Schiff knew of the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint \u2013 a complaint based entirely on hearsay, not firsthand knowledge \u2013 days before it was formally filed. The \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d who was revealed to be a registered Democrat, took his accusations to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who relayed the information to Schiff.\n\nThe revelation called Schiff\u2019s September 17 claims into question. He told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe that \u201cwe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower\u201d:\n\nSo let me get this straight: \u2022 Schiff got a heads up from the Whistleblower before he filed his complaint\n\n\u2022 Schiff sent a staffer to Ukraine on a trip paid for by a Think Tank funded by Burisma\n\n\u2022 Schiff purposely misquoted the Ukraine Call before Congress Noticing a pattern? pic.twitter.com/S8E9enHNU0 \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 2, 2019\n\nA committee spokesperson told the Washington Post that Schiff \u201cintended to answer the question of whether the Committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not\u201d and added that Schiff \u201cacknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased.\u201d\n\nDespite that, the Post gave Schiff Four Pinocchios.\n\nHouse Democrats \u2013 at the lead of Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY), and Schiff \u2013 subpoenaed the White House on Friday over documents related to the Ukraine investigation. The White House signaled that it would not comply with requests until the House held a full vote on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSchiff said on Thursday that House Democrats may have to proceed with impeachment without being able to \u201cflesh out the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there may very well come a point where we have to make the decision that the effort to obstruct has become such an impediment that we have reached a decision point \u2014 even in the absence of being able to fully follow and flesh out the facts surrounding the president\u2019s Ukraine conduct,\u201d Schiff said during an appearance at Northwestern University.", "description": "Rep.
