Gillingham, who is co-founder of the Brooklyn cooking school the Dynamite Shop, considers herself handy, and she liked the sense of ownership and accomplishment that would come with making the oven herself \u2014 especially in time for her 40th birthday party.\n\nGillingham \u201cnerded out\u201d on wood-burning ovens, reading books and watching countless YouTube videos, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much information online, it\u2019s kind of dizzying.\u201d\n\nA few sites suggested that with the help of a few friends, an oven could be built in a weekend from a \u201cput this in quotes,\u201d she says, \u201ckit.\u201d The components, including fire brick, perlite and the oven dome in four pieces, would be delivered on a pallet, ready for assembly.\n\nThat turned out not to be the case. She discovered that the oven needed a two-foot-deep foundation. In April, two months before her birthday, \u201cwe went out and started digging with shovels, in sneakers,\u201d Gillingham says. After hitting roots, she decided to hire a professional. And though she wanted to maintain a sense of having completed the oven herself, putting the pieces together was so difficult Gillingham brought in a mason to help finish the job.\n\n[When DIY projects turn into DIY disasters for homeowners]\n\n\u201cI love it, so I can\u2019t complain,\u201d she says. Still, \u201cI had all these dreams of an outdoor kitchen. Eventually, we\u2019ll do that, but this thing stopped me in my tracks.\u201d\n\nThe Internet \u2014 and cable television \u2014 increasingly makes DIY seem like NBD (no big deal). YouTube is packed with videos on everything from tiling a backsplash to building your own tiny house for under $2,000. And in most cases, they make it look easy. On many home-improvement shows, hosts turn shambolic buildings into stylish abodes in 22 minutes flat.\n\nLittle wonder that Americans are increasingly finding DIY appealing. With some time and sweat, homeowners can save money, learn new skills and (theoretically) ensure their project turns out exactly the way they want it to. They even get the bragging rights that come with designing their own deck or redoing the kitchen.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to DIY projects, even careful, experienced homeowners can unwittingly put themselves in harm\u2019s way. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason some people say DIY really stands for \u201cdestroy it yourself.\u201d Countless homeowners have had to live with projects that didn\u2019t turn out as they\u2019d hoped, spent much more time or money than they anticipated, or had to hire someone to take over. Worse, some people have unwittingly caused major damage to their homes, made modifications that violated building codes or put their safety at risk.\n\nA shocking experience\n\nEven careful, experienced homeowners can unwittingly put themselves in harm\u2019s way.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Laura Sampson bought her parents\u2019 three-bedroom house in the town of Palmer, Alaska, about an hour north of Anchorage. Built in the 1930s as part of the New Deal, the house had been made over in the 1970s. \u201cIt was shag carpets, wallpaper, paneling,\u201d Sampson says. She and her husband have spent years remodeling it themselves, including removing a suspended ceiling and building out a second bathroom.\n\n[Considering installing drywall in your home? It\u2019s harder than you think.]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten more gutsy over the years, especially with the advent of YouTube,\u201d Sampson says. Most of their work has been a success \u2014 including the range hood they made by steaming and bending wood over a frame. But a few years ago, when they decided to install additional outlets in a bathroom, things went awry.\n\n\u201cI thought we had turned off the applicable breakers,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when he touched it, \u2018BSHEW!\u2019 It\u2019s become one of those stories you tell in the family that\u2019s funny, but it was scary. He could have died.\u201d\n\nProfessionals around the country say they\u2019re seeing an uptick in requests to help with \u2014 or fix \u2014 DIY projects.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely a phenomenon we\u2019re seeing more and more,\u201d says Greg Antonioli, president of Out of the Woods Construction & Cabinetry in Waltham, Mass. One reason for the DIY surge, he surmises, is high real estate prices: Home buyers are trying to figure out ways to save money.\n\nYou might assume that pros are keen for bigger, more complex jobs, but the reverse can actually be true. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare when . . . now it\u2019s at the point where they call you,\u201d says Marco Radocaj, general manager at HVAC service company Temp Control in Vero Beach, Fla. When a licensed professional has done the work, you can assume that everything was done correctly, he says. There are no such assurances when a homeowner digs in.\n\nThough 90 percent of air-conditioning fixes are simple, if done wrong, the cost can easily double, Radocaj says. One common \u2014 and costly \u2014 mistake he sees homeowners make is to install an air-conditioning system that\u2019s too large for the house, which can dramatically elevate humidity levels. \u201cWhen drywall is starting to mold, you\u2019re looking at thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of damage and you have to replace the air conditioner,\u201d he says.\n\nKelley Williamson, owner and operator of She Fixed It, a San Diego-based handywoman company, recalls a client who bought an older house that was a little drafty. He decided to remedy the problem by filling his crawl space with expanding foam. \u201cThat stuff expands to 200 times its original size,\u201d Williamson says. In his case, it expanded to the point where it made the ceiling collapse.\n\n\u201cYouTube is great for what it is; I even use it for a resource when I get in a bind,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cBut I think a lot of people see the shows and videos and they have this super, hyper-confidence that they\u2019ve got this down.\u201d\n\nLike Radocaj, Williamson thinks HGTV is even more to blame for DIY mishaps: \u201cAll of the remodeling shows \u2014 or even when they do it on \u2018Queer Eye\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s like, they have these ideas and boom it\u2019s done and it looks amazing. But you don\u2019t even see all the workers that have to do it in a day.\u201d\n\nCode breakers\n\nA few years ago, Antonioli\u2019s contracting firm took on a job for a tech executive who had signed a contract on a house in Arlington, Mass. When the buyer conducted a permit search, he learned that the owners before the current ones had done a DIY kitchen and attic remodel without getting a building permit \u2014 or meeting safety standards.\n\nThe contractor was tasked with pulling out the kitchen cabinets and gutting the walls to examine the work. \u201cThe wiring, it was absolutely atrocious,\u201d Antonioli says. His original contract was for $66,000, but \u201cafter finding major structural issues and very scary wiring, we ended up at a total of $93,000.\u201d\n\n[4 easy DIY home improvement projects you can do in a day]\n\nAs a result of the problems, the seller agreed to accept $100,000 less for the house.\n\nMichael Byrne, director of inspectional services for the town of Arlington, says his office is getting more requests for DIY permits \u2014 and seeing more problems as a result of unpermitted work. One local engineer removed the main support post for his house, causing the roof to start to cave in. \u201cUndersized lumber, it\u2019s almost a given on DIYers, because a two-by-three is cheaper than a two-by-four,\u201d Byrne says. \u201cPeople think they\u2019re saving all this money by not taking out a permit,\u201d but they may be chancing major damage to their home.\n\nOf course, some home-improvement projects are riskier than others \u2014 more likely to look like a scene from \u201cHome Improvement\u201d than HGTV.\n\nExperts say there are several kinds of projects that amateurs would be wise to avoid.\n\n\u201cElectrical or plumbing should not be done without somebody that has a license,\u201d Williamson says. Electrical mistakes can be deadly, and plumbing errors can lead to leaks and floods \u2014 and the resulting damage.\n\nAndrew Helling, a Nebraska real estate agent and owner of REthority.com, an online resource for real estate professionals and their clients, says roofs are wise to leave to the pros for similar reasons. Falls can be serious, and even a tiny hole can cause a destructive leak.\n\nAaron Bowman, a real estate investor in Windsor, Conn., has relied on YouTube for several DIY projects, including guidance with replacing windows at a rental property. \u201cThere have been other projects that didn\u2019t go as well, even after watching a YouTube video,\u201d he says. \u201cThis one time I had a gas furnace with a pilot light that would not stay on. So I figured out what needed to be replaced and ended up having the wrong settings and almost blew myself up.\u201d He no longer messes with gas.\n\nKitchen remodeling is popular but often requires a building permit \u2014 and a project can easily violate local building codes, Helling says.\n\nExperts offer a few tips for deciding whether to undertake a DIY project. First, consider the worst that can happen. Finish carpentry is a good option for amateurs for this reason, says Antonioli: \u201cYou really can\u2019t end up hurting somebody down the road.\u201d\n\nConsider whether special tools are needed, and whether you\u2019re willing to invest in them. Look into whether a building permit is required: If it is, think twice. Finally, DIY for realistic reasons.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say DIY saves you a ton of money \u2014 it depends how you value your own time,\u201d Laura Sampson says. \u201cA lot of time you have a project that takes four or five weeks longer than if you had just hired someone.\u201d\n\nThough her family has been able to travel with some of the cash they\u2019ve saved with DIY, what\u2019s even more important is the stamp they\u2019ve left on their home.\n\n\u201cWe have all these things that we\u2019ve done that we love so much,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we\u2019d gone to the box store, bought it and slapped it up, we wouldn\u2019t love it the way that we do.\u201d\n\nAnd, she adds, the fuse box is completely labeled now.", "description": "The Internet and TV increasingly make home improvement seem easy.
