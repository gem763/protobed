In short: the celebration of all things guitary and \u201cauthentic\u201d over music that is shiny and instant). \u201cRockism is not intellectually an honest place to be, so this is more just a personal observation of what I don\u2019t want to do,\u201d he has said. Hence the abrupt step change here: bright shiny synths replace guitars, three songs are written by Charli XCX, and the songs are structured around huge singalong choruses, with Tweedy\u2019s voice Auto-Tuned to within an inch of its life.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wilco: Ode to Joy album art work\n\nNot really. Of course not. Because as Tweedy also said of rockism: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that we are not going to have any audience any more if we don\u2019t keep perpetuating this.\u201d So Ode to Joy will not scare away the existing fans: it\u2019s not an experimental album at all; in fact it\u2019s so stripped back it\u2019s sometimes arid, with acoustic guitar and a deadened, deliberately martial and plodding drum kit the dominant sounds (don\u2019t fret: there are some explosive Nels Cline guitar solos, too). Tweedy\u2019s crisis is expressed lyrically, rather than musically, though it\u2019s only the knowledge of his feelings that sends one looking for clues. \u201cI never change / You never change / There\u2019s no decision / Sometimes I\u2019m just a hole for you to get in,\u201d he sings on Bright Leaves. Is he singing about a lover, or about his fans? In One and a Half Stars, he complains: \u201cI\u2019m left with only my desire to change\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t escape my domain.\u201d\n\nThese are songs where the expressiveness of the lyrics and the baldness of the music \u2013 usually big, simple blocks, put together like Lego \u2013 work in tandem. The plainness of the instrumentation heightens the uncertainty and ambivalence in Tweedy\u2019s writing, in which he seems to be searching for reasons \u2013 to justify not just Wilco, but existence itself. \u201cAre we all in love just because?\u201d he wonders on Hold Me Anyway. \u201cNo!\u201d he replies. \u201cI think it\u2019s poetry and magic / Something too big to have a name.\u201d Maybe the next record will be the one with the Charli XCX songs. We\u2019ll see.", "description": "Stripped back it may be, but Wilco\u2019s 11th album combines expressive lyrics about change with big singalong choruses", "authors": ["Michael Hann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a5b37a659d70b4d3eb79540f3addc186b720a73/500_950_4817_2890/master/4817.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7a1db21c645e1c33310800d12726f8c2", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
