We wanted everyone to define their own nude without us telling them that nude shadow was a one size fits all.\"\n\nPHOTO: Huda Beauty launches new limited-edition Nude Obsessions Eyeshadow Palettes. (Huda Beauty) More\n\nThe new collection includes three palettes in Light, Medium and Rich that feature a rich mix of nine matte and shimmery shades that all fall somewhere within a neutral category of hues.\n\n(MORE: Huda Beauty founder talks about women's empowerment, how passion has led to her success)\n\n\"My nude is not the same as your nude and I'm aware of that and sensitive to it,\" said Kattan in a statement. \"So, we approached eyeshadow with this in mind, to prove we understand it and we're doing something about it beyond complexion.\"\n\nWhen rewinding back to the process of creating these shades, Kattan admitted it wasn't easy because she understood the importance of getting the shades just right.\n\nPHOTO: Huda Beauty launches new limited-edition Nude Obsessions Eyeshadow Palettes. (via Huda Beauty) More\n\n\"Creating these palettes came with a lot of testing on many different skin tones with various undertones,\" Kattan explained. \"We had to be sure that no matter what we released we covered everyone. We didn't just create these because they look nice, we created these with purpose and we're really excited to be giving everyone the diversity they deserve in a nude palette.\"\n\n(MORE: Get the look: How to transform into Aladdin's Princess Jasmine for Halloween)\n\nThis isn't Huda Beauty's first go-around with nudes, and the brand's previously released The New Nude eyeshadow palette continues to receive rave reviews and be one of the most sought-after on the market.\n\nWhat makes the new palette different is not only that it's easier to travel with, but it also disrupts the thought of the shades being called \"universal.\"\n\n\"We thought it was important to give people more nudes to pick and choose from so they could define their own nude without us telling them what 'works for everyone,'\" she added.\n\nThe new shades are highly pigmented and retail for $29. Kattan's favorite happens to be the Medium palette. It includes rich chestnut, deep brown and metallic shimmer in addition to gorgeous golds and dusty pinks.\n\nPHOTO: Huda Beauty launches new limited-edition Nude Obsessions Eyeshadow Palettes.
