He had played in three games for New York this season before things got murky with the team.\n\nNEW YORK JETS' DEMARYIUS THOMAS LAMENTS 'WASTING' TIME WITH NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS\n\nOsemele refused to practice Saturday after being told Friday he would be fined if he did not do so, according to the New York Post. Osemele contends he needs surgery to repair a torn labrum and said he physically cannot play because of the pain he\u2019s suffering in his shoulder.\n\n\"It's been killing me,\" he said. \"I'm just trying to get this done. I've done everything I can. I've been at work every day, waking up at 5 in the morning, doing all the rehab and the treatments and stuff like that. I'm like the last dude out of here at night. I'm doing everything I can. I'm working with my agent. We're communicating with the team.\n\n\"There's just not communication between the team and my doctor and my agent. It's just been butting heads for whatever reason. Hopefully, it gets resolved soon.\"\n\nHe first appeared on the injury report on Oct. 2 and has not played or practiced since, the New York Post reported. His agent told The Athletic last month that he needed Toradol shots to play in the first three games.\n\nCHICAGO BEARS' TARIK COHEN MOCKED OVER HEIGHT DURING GAME VS.
