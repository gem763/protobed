Its operations include exploration and production of oil and gas, as well as refining, petrochemicals, international shipping, marketing and distribution of oil and gas.\n\n\"This is no ordinary company, this is a company that runs a country, a country which is pivotal to what happens in the Middle East,\" said Al Jazeera's Osama Bin Javaid, who has examined the strategic importance of the oil giant in his documentary titled Saudi Aramco: The Company and the State.\n\n\"Saudi Aramco is at the heart of not just politics, but economy and life in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nVast profits\n\nIn April, the company released its earnings figures for the first time in recent memory, showing Aramco to be the world's most profitable company.\n\nIt revealed net profits of $111bn and revenue close to $356bn for 2018.\n\nBy contrast, Apple booked a net profit of about $60bn in its most recent full year, Royal Dutch Shell had net income of $23bn and Exxon Mobil $21bn.\n\nMeanwhile, an independent audit showed Saudi Arabia has 268.5 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves as of the end of 2017. Aramco produced about 10.3 million barrels per day of crude oil in 2018.\n\n\n\n190826061038080\n\n\"Saudi Aramco is the largest oil producer globally by volume,\" ratings agency Fitch said in April.\n\nAramco CEO Amin Nasser told reporters on Tuesday that the company was ready for a two-stage stock market debut including an international listing \"very soon\".\n\nBased on the indicated $2 trillion valuation that Aramco had hoped to achieve, a one-percent float would be worth $20bn.\n\nSaudi Arabia has reportedly hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead the IPO, planned for as early as 2020, and has been meeting bankers this week in Dubai, UAE, as it speeds up the listing plans.\n\nInvestment implications\n\nBin Javaid said Saturday's drone attacks could have a \"wider implication on Saudi Arabia and people looking at Saudi Arabia as a possible investment opportunity\".\n\n\"If you were going to put money into Saudi Arabia, this would give you pause; you would want to see how long is this going to last for and what are going to be the implications,\" he said.\n\n\"What the Houthis have done is not just inflict damage, it is symbolic as well. They have told Saudi Arabia that they have a list of targets, they are going to be continuing their attacks, so this is a perpetual problem which Saudi Arabia has not been able to engage away from,\" he added.\n\nIn recent months, Houthi rebels have carried out a series of drone and missile attacks targeting Saudi air bases and other facilities.\n\nIn August, a Houthi-claimed attack sparked a fire at Aramco's Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility but no casualties were reported by the company.\n\nSaudi Arabia intervened in Yemen in 2015, leading a military coalition in support of the internationally recognised President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was forced out of power by the Houthis.\n\nThe war has killed tens of thousands of people and sparked what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.", "description": "Seen as Saudi Arabia's business crown jewel, the oil giant employs more than 65,000 people worldwide.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/14/b1dd02359ffd4247b4ce952c7401db56_18.jpg"}
