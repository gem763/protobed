Ramsden told Bloomberg in an interview that Brexit uncertainty has damaged the supply capacity of the British economy, lowering the rate at which it can grow without generating inflation in future.\n\nAnd two Federal Reserve officials also chimed in, with Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan saying that the Fed\u2019s two cuts so far this year don\u2019t represent the start of a \u201cfull-fledged rate cutting cycle.\u201d\n\nKaplan said he expected strong consumer demand to keep sustaining the U.S. economy through a soft patch in business investment caused by trade uncertainty. His sentiments were echoed more starkly at the same event Kansas City Fed chief Esther George, who had already dissented from the last two decisions to cut the Fed Funds rate.\n\n\"While weakness in manufacturing and business investment is evident, it is not clear that monetary policy is the appropriate tool to offset the risks faced by businesses in those sectors, when weighted against the costs that could be associated with such action,\u201d George said.\n\n\u201cIf you actually trade gold you can feel the lack of emotion in the markets these days as buying interest continues to run tepid,\u201d said Axitrader market strategist Stephen Innes. \u201cThe expectation for weaker economic data and the current level of central bank policy response seems to be all factored into the current price, suggesting gold traders need a new catalyst.\u201d\n\nInnes cautioned against taking major positions ahead of a \u201cbinary\u201d Brexit event on Saturday, when the U.K. House of Commons votes on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s EU Withdrawal Agreement. However, breaking reports suggest that opponents of the bill have crafted an amendment that would still force the government to seek a three-month extension to the Brexit deadline \u2013 a time that they hope would expose what they see as the bill\u2019s shortcomings. A poll by research firm YouGov suggests U.K. voters support the agreement by a margin of 2:1.", "description": "Gold Prices Fall as Central Bankers Damp Rate Cut Hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED0M02I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
