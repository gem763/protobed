It is understood that he will make a final decision on how to instruct MPs once the EU27 have confirmed what extension the UK will be offered.\n\nOne Labour MP said they had been told they could abstain or vote against the motion for an election.\n\nCorbyn said: \u201cNo deal is a threat that Boris Johnson has been using all along, and indeed it\u2019s included in his legislation that\u2019s before parliament at the moment, the legislation that he\u2019s paused.\n\n\u201cI want us not to crash out of the EU because of all the damage it will do to jobs across the country. We\u2019ll know tomorrow [Friday] what the extension will be and I can answer that question tomorrow. What I\u2019m saying now is, take no deal off the table.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister said an election was needed to try to help the country move on after parliament voted for his Brexit deal but rejected the timetable for scrutinising it and asked for more time.\n\nJohnson\u2019s offer is to allow MPs to debate his EU withdrawal bill agreement until 6 November. He will ask them to vote in favour of this option on Monday with a motion under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.\n\nLabour MP Barry Sheerman said the party would not be bounced into an election and the earliest they should consider is next spring. He said: \u2018\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to agree to this. This is a usual Boris tactic of trying to bounce us into a Brexit election and we aren\u2019t buying that. I\u2019d want a post-Brexit election on the economy and health and everything that really matters.\n\n\u201cWe had a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party two weeks ago where right across the range of opinion in the party we said we wouldn\u2019t support an early election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Momentum, the campaigning group that supports Corbyn, said it would back an election now, though it was not specific about whether it wanted MPs to back Johnson\u2019s offer.\n\nLaura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cBring it on. Our campaign will see tens of thousands of people talk to millions of voters across the country. In 2017 Momentum\u2019s campaign swung key seats for Labour. This time we\u2019re going to run the biggest people-powered campaign the country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nCorbyn denied that Labour\u2019s position on a general election was confused, given that they have consistently said they want voters to go to the polls to oust the Tories.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are not resisting the chance to have an election. We want an election because we want to take our case to the people of this country, but we do not want this country to be in any danger of crashing out of the EU without a deal because of all the damage that will do to jobs, services and trade all over this country.\u201d\n\nHe said rather than keeping Johnson in office by not backing an election, Labour was holding him to account and continually defeating the government in parliament.\n\nThe Labour leader also declined to answer questions on recent polling for Labour, which puts them behind the Tories.\n\nAsked if he was against an election because of concerns that he would lose, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into an election knowing that no deal has been operated. I want to stop no deal, then [have] an election.\u201d\n\nIn the hours leading up to Johnson\u2019s offer, Corbyn\u2019s most senior ally, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, was upbeat about the prospect of a winter election.\n\nAt lunchtime on Thursday, McDonnell said he was ready for an election \u201cwhenever\u201d, but the party had been trying to pressure the government into giving them more time to scrutinise the Brexit deal to make sure there were better protections for the economy, jobs and living standards.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest that he wanted to see an amendment added that would enable the deal to go to a public vote. \u201cWe\u2019re being accused all the time trying to prevent the Brexit process happening. We\u2019re not,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cWe\u2019re just saying we want a proper process, but that must include the ability to put amendments up and an amendment up to enable it to go back to the people.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell added that he was not worried about Labour\u2019s chances or the unusual time of year. \u201cI want a majority Labour government and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ll get. It\u2019s a bit cold. Anything could happen \u2026 I\u2019ve ordered a winter coat.\n\n\u201cMy preference is to get an agreement in which we could consider the bill properly, but I\u2019m always up for an election whenever it comes and I\u2019ve got my winter coat ready.\u201d", "description": "MPs may be told to abstain in Monday\u2019s vote, with Jeremy Corbyn to make call on Friday", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8215b3df20901c6054eb0dd94335b599f6e2125a/0_0_5336_3201/master/5336.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a2a3873bdd5f1ec7101de1f516b0429", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
