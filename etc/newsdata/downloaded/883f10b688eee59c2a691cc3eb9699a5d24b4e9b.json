The agreement was confirmed by the Cowboys.\n\nElliott returned to the Dallas area Tuesday and is expected to be on the practice field Wednesday with the Cowboys.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been ready,\u201d Elliott said, according to WFAA-TV in Dallas, as he walked past reporters and fans gathered Tuesday evening at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nAD\n\nAgent Rocky Arceneaux, who was accompanying Elliott, told reporters that the two sides were \u201cvery, very close\u201d to a deal, according to multiple accounts, and added: \u201cThey\u2019re committed and we\u2019re committed. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nSorry, Melvin Gordon, but Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s contract is an outlier among running backs\n\nElliott and Arceneaux quickly proceeded to a meeting with Cowboys officials and the deal was completed by Wednesday morning.\n\nThe $15 million average annual value of the extension makes Elliott, by that measure, the NFL\u2019s highest-paid running back, just ahead of the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 Todd Gurley.\n\nAD\n\nGurley agreed last year to a four-year contract extension with the Rams worth $57.5 million, including $45 million in guaranteed money. Gurley\u2019s contract has a potential maximum value of $60 million. Le\u2019Veon Bell signed a four-year, $52.5 million deal, including $35 million in guaranteed money, with the New York Jets in March as a free agent. Bell\u2019s contract can be worth as much as $61 million all told.\n\nAD\n\nElliott, 24, has led the league in rushing in two of his three NFL seasons with the Cowboys. He ran for an NFL-best 1,434 yards last season. He had two seasons remaining on his original rookie contract with the Cowboys, including the fifth-year option previously exercised by the team. That deal pays Elliott $3.9 million for the upcoming 2019 season and $9 million for the 2020 season.\n\nHe had been holding out, seeking a new long-term contract. With the Cowboys facing the prospect of going into the regular season without the focal point of their offense, negotiations intensified over the long holiday weekend.\n\nAD\n\nWhen he made his weekly appearance on a Dallas-area radio station Tuesday, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the team was preparing to face the Giants with the players already on hand but was hopeful of getting the Elliott deal done.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt will be great \u2014 will be and would be great \u2014 if before a short period of time passes that Zeke would be in that group,\u201d Jones said on 105.3 The Fan, before the agreement was officially in place. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see how today goes. We\u2019ll see how tomorrow goes. We\u2019ll see how the ensuing hours pan out.\u201d\n\nEzekiel Elliott cashed in with a massive deal. The numbers say he isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nElliott had been training in Mexico; Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk helped Elliott to train recently while in Cabo San Lucas.\n\nAD\n\nThe Cowboys signed right tackle La\u2019el Collins to a five-year, $50 million extension Tuesday and still must deal with the contract situations of quarterback Dak Prescott and wide receiver Amari Cooper. Both are in line for lucrative new deals.\n\nBut now they have Elliott back in the fold and can focus on readying him for the matchup with the Giants as they seek to defend last season\u2019s NFC East title. Cowboys players were off Tuesday and are scheduled to resume practicing Wednesday. The Cowboys will have to determine whether they can have Elliott ready for something approaching his normal workload Sunday after missing training camp and the preseason.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get that far ahead of it,\u201d Jones said during Tuesday\u2019s radio appearance. \u201cBut I know him to be, just knowing him, would know him to be in great shape for any type workload. He should be fresh.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCoach Jason Garrett had declined to specify to reporters Monday by which day Elliott would have to join the team this week to be ready to play Sunday. But Garrett suggested then that Elliott could move quickly through his preparations.\n\n\u201cZeke is as capable as anybody I know,\u201d Garrett said at Monday\u2019s news conference. \u201cHe\u2019s an experienced player. He\u2019s been a really good player for us. He knows our system of football. I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a lot of learning there. He\u2019s a smart guy. He\u2019s an instinctive guy.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys face the Washington Redskins in Week 2 at FedEx Field.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nDaniel Snyder dreamed of owning the Redskins.
