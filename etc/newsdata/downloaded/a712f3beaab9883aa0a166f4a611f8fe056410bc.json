I would know, as I\u2019ve been following economic affairs in the country for decades.\n\nManafort became top political adviser to Ukraine\u2019s then President Viktor Yanukovych in the summer of 2005. He was tremendously skillful as a political operative \u2014 intelligent, courteous, unassuming. He focused on winning elections for his client and making as much money as possible. Without Manafort, it\u2019s fair to say Yanukovych would have lost the tight 2010 presidential race to pro-Western Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nWhen Trump appointed Manafort as his campaign manager in 2016, he was not the least concerned about his decades spent lobbying for disreputable politicians. Much like Yanukovych, Trump owes his narrow presidential victory to Manafort. As such, his decision to sack Manafort when it became public he had received $12.7 million from a \u201cblack ledger\u201d kept by Yanukovych came as a surprise. (He retained Manafort\u2019s long-time deputy Rick Gates as deputy campaign manager.)\n\nAs Manafort left the stage, Trump reactivated his engagement in Ukraine via two Ukrainian emigr\u00e9s in the U.S. \u2014 who created backchannels to top officials in Kiev and pushed for the removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine \u2014 and Giuliani, his attorney.\n\nUkraine doesn't have a track record of appointing honest prosecutors general.\n\nGiuliani, like Manafort, is well entrenched in Ukraine and has earned big money there. He started traveling to the country in the mid-2000s, when he gave a well-paid speech to an event organized and paid for by Vadim Rabinovich, an old commodity trader with a controversial reputation.\n\nIn 2017, Giuliani concluded a well-paid \u201ccyber security contract\u201d with Ukraine through then President Petro Poroshenko, and signed a \u201csecurity contract\u201d with Kharkiv\u2019s Mayor Gennady Kernes, who was almost killed in a gang dispute in 2014. He also had a contract with the Russian-Ukrainian real estate developer Pavel Fuks, who was involved in a failed real estate deal with Trump in Moscow in 2006.\n\nLast May, Giuliani waded into Ukraine\u2019s political affairs, attacking anti-corruption activists and claiming that Serhiy Leshchenko, a former investigative journalist and then a member of parliament, had falsified the so-called black ledger. The accusations against Manafort were false, he insisted.\n\nThat track record should discredit his latest claim: that former vice president, now Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden forced the sacking of Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin in March 2016 in order to stop an investigation into the owner of a gas company, Burisma, that has had Biden\u2019s son Hunter on its board since May 2014 for an allegedly high fee.\n\nUkraine doesn't have a track record of appointing honest prosecutors general. Shokin, who was close to former President Poroshenko, refused to prosecute a single member of the Yanukovych regime and faced widespread accusations of corruption himself. He was ousted in 2016 thanks to a united front of Ukrainian anti-corruption activists and Western pressure led by Biden.\n\nUnfortunately, Poroshenko appointed Yuriy Lutsenko as prosecutor general, and he acted just like Shokin, and no senior member of the Yanukovych or Poroshenko governments has been prosecuted.\n\nBut in a sign change may be underway, the new Ukrainian parliament \u2014 where the party of the recently elected President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has a majority \u2014 sacked Lutsenko on its first day in session in August. Whether the new prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, will break from the example set by his predecessors is an open question.\n\nThe now infamous phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy \u2014 which is at the center of a whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official \u2014 took place on July 25, just a month earlier. The U.S. president reportedly wanted to congratulate his fellow TV star-turned-president on his election victory. But, as I learned in a private briefing several days later, Trump told Zelenskiy he would not meet with him or provide the $250 million in military aid granted to Ukraine by Congress unless he offered up dirt on Biden and his son. Zelenskiy, flabbergasted, reportedly responded that no such evidence existed.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, stood firm. His behavior may be shocking \u2014 and has rightly prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to throw her support behind impeachment proceedings against him. But we shouldn\u2019t be surprised it\u2019s come to this. Trump surrounded himself with people used to doing dirty business in Ukraine. It was, perhaps, inevitable he would sooner or later get caught in that same quagmire.\n\nAnders \u00c5slund is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and author of the new book \u201cRussia\u2019s Crony Capitalism: The Path from Market Economy to Kleptocracy.\u201d", "description": "US president\u2019s inner circle has been involved in controversial business deals in the country for years.", "authors": ["Anders \u00c5slund", "Quint Forgey", "Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170743352-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
