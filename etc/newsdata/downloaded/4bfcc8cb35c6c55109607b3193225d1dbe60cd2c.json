Especially when the destination might involve giant mosquitoes or Instagram-worthy hiking trails. What do frequent travelers to these spots \u2014 the ones who best know how to prepare for the conditions \u2014 put in their suitcases? We\u2019ll be tackling this in our new series, the Trip List.\n\nHere, we talked to cruise-line operators, wildlife photographers, and numerous others who\u2019ve recently boarded a ship to Alaska. If you\u2019ve ever seen a reality TV show set in this northern tip of the world, you know two things to be true: (1) It\u2019s a wild, wild place, and (2) that wild, wild place wants to kill you. Even though most of us taking a vacation there are more likely to confront surprise rainstorms and buggy beaches rather than avalanches and grizzly bears, you still need the right protection. Luckily, because the cruising season is short (starting in late April and continuing through September), most boat trips are booked six months to a year in advance \u2014 so you have plenty of time to gear up.\n\nClothing\n\nColumbia Women\u2019s Midweight Stretch Baselayer Long Sleeve Half Zip Shirt Award-winning photographer and travel writer Susan Portnoy, a.k.a. the Insatiable Traveler, visited Alaska last year on Holland America Line\u2019s Land+Sea Journey. That\u2019s when she learned that dressing the part starts with proper layering. \u201cIf it\u2019s extra nippy outside or you\u2019re hiking a glacier, you\u2019re going to want a base layer,\u201d says Portnoy. \u201cI love love love Columbia\u2019s stretch top with Omni-Heat technology. When you move, your heat is reflected back on to your body.\u201d $58 at Amazon Buy $58 at Amazon Buy\n\nColumbia Women\u2019s Midweight Stretch Baselayer Tight For the same reason, Portnoy loves the Omni-Heat bottoms, too. \u201cThe stretchy fabric is super comfortable and the midweight option never feels too hot,\u201d she says. \u201cPlus, they\u2019ve treated it with some kind of antimicrobial thingamajig, so after a long day [of wear], you don\u2019t feel like you have to throw them in the laundry.\u201d $51 at Amazon Buy $51 at Amazon Buy\n\nHelly Hansen Shore Hybrid Insulator Rory M. Martin, deputy director of Expedition Operations at Seabourn, has been with the cruise line since 2013 and joined the ultra-luxurious Seabourn Sojourn for the ship\u2019s last three seasons in Alaska. He, too, is a big proponent of layering. This lightweight, insulated marine jacket from Helly Hansen gives travelers \u201cgreat mobility and core warmth,\u201d says Martin, and pairs well with a raincoat as needed. \u201cIt\u2019s warm enough to keep the chill out and light enough to keep you comfortable while moving.\u201d $130 at Amazon Buy $130 at Amazon Buy\n\nREI Co-op Sahara Convertible Pants Rebekah Law, a Cruise & Travel Director for Holland America Line, has 18 years of experience at sea. She is currently five months into her fifth Alaskan season on the MS Eurodam. First and foremost, she recommends a great pair of quick-drying pants. The lightweight nylon Sahara pants from REI have zip-off legs, making them easy to convert to shorts. (This two-in-one deal is helpful, says Law, because of rising temperatures during the Alaskan cruising season.) $70 at REI Buy\n\nREI Co-op Kornati Roll-Up Pants Another Law favorite: The legs on the Kornati style can be rolled to capri length. Both these and the Sahara offer UPF 50+ sun protection, which comes in handy when you\u2019re out and about on daily excursions. $70 at REI Buy\n\nColumbia Women\u2019s Storm Surge Waterproof Rain Pants \u201cAlaska is gorgeous in any weather, but during cruising season when it\u2019s not cold enough to snow, it\u2019s often raining,\u201d Portnoy says. \u201cA common port like Ketchikan averages 13 feet of rain a year, meaning if it isn\u2019t raining, you\u2019re witnessing a miracle.\u201d Most travelers remember to pack a lightweight raincoat, but often forget the rain pants. \u201cI was glad I had them, especially when outdoors for long periods of time,\u201d says Portnoy, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re easy to pack, fit over your regular layer, and will keep you warm and dry even in a downpour.\u201d From $20 at Amazon Buy From $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nHelly Hansen Packable Pant Martin is also a fan of the rain pant, particularly this multifunctional pair from Helly Hansen. It\u2019s waterproof, windproof, lined with quick-drying fabric, and packs into its own zipped thigh pocket, making it easy to tote on shore excursions. $85 at Amazon Buy $85 at Amazon Buy\n\nDiamond Candy Waterproof Rain Jacket \u201cYou cannot go to Alaska without thinking about and preparing for the rain,\u201d says Chris Gray Faust, managing editor at Cruise Critic and a four-time Alaskan cruiser. \u201cThe Inside Passage abuts the Tongass National Forest, which is a temperate rainforest. And what does it do in a rainforest? It rains!\u201d Faust likes a rain shell with a hood and layers, so she can peel them off as needed. \u201cBonus points if it\u2019s lightweight, so you can stash it in your backpack when the sun comes out.\u201d From $41 at Amazon Buy From $41 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe North Face Tech Glacier Quarter-Zip Fleece Pullover Also in Law\u2019s arsenal: a long-sleeve fleece. This midweight North Face pullover has a flattering modern shape and smooth brushed fleece texture. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nMarmot PreCip Eco Jacket $65 (was $100, now 35% off) Meanwhile, the hip-length Precip, made of recycled nylon fabric, is Law\u2019s choice for a water- and wind-resistant jacket. There is a hood hidden in the collar, zippers in the armpits for fresh air, and enough color options to keep your outfit interesting. $65 at Amazon Buy $65 at Amazon Buy\n\nUniqlo Women Ultra Light Down Jacket Geetika Agrawal, founder of Vacation With An Artist (VAWAA), just wrapped up her first Alaskan cruise with her family. She\u2019s glad she bought a lightweight down jacket for chilly glacier walks and \u201cnighttime hangs on the cruise deck.\u201d The shell, made of nylon and polyester and filled with down, was both water-repellent and easy to pack. $70 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nMarmot Men\u2019s Bantamweight Jacket Globetrotting photographer Peter West Carey shoots landscape, travel, and nature scenes \u2014 and teaches others how to do the same. He has been on six small-ship cruises to Alaska with UnCruise Adventures, documenting the boats in action and teaching photography onboard as a guest host \u2014 so he knows what it takes to weather the elements. \u201cI\u2019ve trusted Marmot for my outdoor rain gear for over 20 years and it always performs as expected,\u201d says Carey. \u201cA rain jacket that is smaller and packable is key in Alaska. Quick weather changes mean rain gear should always be in your day pack.\u201d $275 at Amazon Buy $275 at Amazon Buy\n\nShoes and accessories\n\nL.L.Bean Women's Bean Boots 8\" Tumbled-Leather Shearling-Lined You can\u2019t forget your feet, according to Yves Segers, General Manager on Oceania Cruises\u2019 MS Regatta. \u201cMost guests sign up for adventurous shore excursions that immerse them in Alaska\u2019s wild natural environment; I recommend they bring waterproof boots to keep their feet comfortable and dry.\u201d These tumbled-leather 8\u201d boots are lined in shearling and available in variable widths (Medium B and Wide D). $229 at L.L.Bean Buy\n\nKeen Koven Hiking Shoes Law seconds the need for solid footwear, but thinks travelers can get away with great hiking shoes if they don\u2019t want to pack bulkier boots. Keen\u2019s Koven are comfy, water-resistant, and available in half sizes and wider widths, depending on the style. $90 at Amazon Buy $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nSmartwool Men\u2019s PhD Outdoor Medium Crew Socks Martin agrees that \u201ctaking care of your feet is important,\u201d and the socks you pack can be as crucial as the shoes. He says this pair \u201ckeeps me moving comfortably, whether walking around one of the great Alaskan towns, walking the ship\u2019s deck, or hiking to explore the beauty of Alaska.\u201d $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nREI Co-op CoolMax Midweight Hiking Crew Socks Faust on the good-socks front: \u201cYou have to have them, as cold feet will make you feel miserable,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if you aren\u2019t outside, Alaskan cruise tours spend a lot of time on buses and trains, which can be drafty.\u201d Faust buys hers from REI. She likes this midweight hiker style because it \u201cgives you the warmth you need, without a lot of bulk.\u201d $15 at REI Buy\n\nRay-Ban Women\u2019s RB4061 Oval Sunglasses $130 (was $178, now 27% off) Sunglasses are a no brainer in Alaska. \u201cThe light there is very intense, and if there\u2019s snow it\u2019s even stronger,\u201d explains Portnoy. Look for polarized lenses to cut the glare and pick plastic frames if possible. \u201cI learned that lesson the hard way,\u201d she warns. \u201cFrozen metal against your face is mighty uncomfortable.\u201d $130 at Amazon Buy $130 at Amazon Buy\n\nFlygo Women\u2019s Winter Knitted Neck Warmer Neck gaiters are another undersung hero of the cruising set. \u201cParticularly in places like Denali in the interior, or Juneau on the Inside Passage, you want to make sure you\u2019re neck isn\u2019t exposed to the wind,\u201d says Faust, who always packs multiple gaiters because \u201cthey provide better protection than a flimsy scarf.\u201d Earlier this year in Norway, she discovered what she calls the ultimate neck funnel: The outside was wool, the inside was lined with faux fur, and it was stretchy enough that she could yank it over her ears and head as needed. It kept her toasty warm throughout Scandinavia and Alaska. Though hers was Norwegian, Flygo sells a similar version on Amazon. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nSherpa Adventure Gear Sabi Hat \u201cNo one knows cold weather like the Sherpas of Nepal,\u201d says Carey, who has spent a lot of time shooting in the Himalayas. \u201cThis hat is handcrafted in Nepal and combines lambswool for warmth plus a high-tech Polarfleece lining for all-day comfort. There\u2019s no doubt if you\u2019re outdoors anywhere at night, or if your ship is nuzzling up close to a glacier, you\u2019ll want this hat on your head.\u201d $37 at REI Buy\n\nSkincare\n\nCOOLA Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 When packing up your toiletries, don\u2019t forget the sunscreen. \u201cAlthough Alaska is in the north, it can be quite sunny,\u201d says Segers. \u201cThe strength of the sun can be quite deceiving even on an overcast day.\u201d He likes COOLA\u2019s reef-safe organic sunscreen spray with SPF 30 protection. It\u2019s ultra sheer, water-resistant up to 80 minutes, and available in two natural scents (pina colada and tropical coconut) as well as fragrance-free. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nOFF! Deep Woods Insect Repellent VIII Dry $8 (was $12, now 33% off) \u201cA lot of travelers think that because Alaska in the northern part of the world, that means it\u2019s insect-free, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d says Ruth Ortiz, Executive Concierge on Oceania Cruises\u2019 MS Regatta. \u201cAlaska can be quite mild and wet, making it the perfect environment for mosquitoes.\u201d A mighty insect repellent is essential and should be used liberally during shore excursions. $8 for 2 at Amazon Buy $8 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhoto: TREVOR MILLER The Original VBS Bug Spray Ramon Conde concurs. He has taken three family cruises to Alaska \u2014 one with Holland America Line and two with Princess \u2014 and remembers swatting away monster mosquitoes at Eagle Beach in Juneau. His preferred brand of bug spray is VBS, a.k.a. \u201cfishermen\u2019s favorite.\u201d The mist repels skeeters, buffalo gnats, noseeums, fleas, chiggers, and biting flies and comes in three scents: cedar, vanilla, and eucalyptus. It contains no DEET or other abrasive chemicals. $9 at Big Reds Bait Buy\n\nGear and electronics\n\nOutdoor Products All Purpose Dry Sack Do you care about that expensive telephoto zoom lens? Better protect it. \u201cIf you\u2019re on an adventure or expedition cruise in Alaska, Zodiacs are typically used to transport people to shore instead of docking like the bigger cruise ships, and they often get wet from splashing water,\u201d says Portnoy. \u201cI use these sacks to keep things like my cameras, day pack, and change of clothes dry.\u201d Amazon sells a three-fer of the polyurethane-coated packs in two-, four-, and eight-liter sizes. $10 for 3 at Amazon Buy $10 for 3 at Amazon Buy\n\nJBL Xtreme Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker $175 (was $300, now 42% off) Music makes the moment, right? It does for Agrawal at least, who packed a portable bluetooth speaker so she could play music in her cabin. \u201cCruising in the middle of the ocean is very peaceful; music adds to that magic,\u201d she notes. This splashproof speaker can handle a little rain on deck, no problem, and has a built-in rechargeable battery that lasts up to 15 hours. $175 at Amazon Buy $175 at Amazon Buy\n\nYubi Universal Power Strip \u201cHaving enough outlets seems to always be an issue,\u201d says Carey. \u201cSome boats only had two outlets per cabin \u2014 not enough for a power hungry photographer like me.\u201d That\u2019s why he always packs a universal power strip with twin USB ports for charging smartphones and tablets. \u201cThat\u2019s two less adapters I need to bring along.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
