Blackface\u2019 would help them. That\u2019s changed.", "language": "en", "text": "No one mentioned resignation when Gov. Ralph Northam recently hobnobbed at Rep. Bobby Scott\u2019s annual Labor Day picnic in Newport News. No students protested when Northam attended a seminar at historically black Virginia Union University last week. And when Northam spoke about the legacy of slavery at Fort Monroe late last month, there were no boos, only standing ovations.\n\nNortham is still wounded by a blackface scandal that almost cost him his job in February. But with campaign season in full swing during a crucial election year, he is far from the pariah that most people expected. Instead, Northam is making big donations to a few campaigns, attending fundraisers throughout the state and rallying fellow Democrats on issues such as health care and gun control.\n\nRepublicans have even eased up on the \u201cGov. Blackface\u201d attacks that were common earlier in the spring and summer. GOP campaigns are now more likely to warn about Democrats pushing socialism than to call Northam a racist. Two Republicans involved with campaigns said internal polling has shown the Northam attacks were not helping them woo voters.\n\n\u201cThat will not be a theme in any campaign I\u2019m associated with,\u201d said one of the Republicans, a strategist working with several candidates around the state who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\n\u201cSix months ago [Republicans] thought they might be able to run against Ralph Northam, but polls have shown Northam has not suffered a great deal in the court of public opinion for his behavior in his 20s, and he hasn\u2019t turned out to be the silver bullet that Republicans might have been hoping for,\u201d said University of Mary Washington political scientist Stephen Farnsworth.\n\n[How Ralph Northam and aides made his blackface scandal even worse]\n\nNortham will probably never escape the cloud of the events in February, when a photo surfaced from his 1984 medical school yearbook page showing one person in blackface and another in Ku Klux Klan robes. Northam initially took responsibility for the photo and was poised to resign over the backlash.\n\nThen, in one rollicking day, he said he wasn\u2019t in the photo, vowed to remain in office and admitted to darkening his face to imitate Michael Jackson in a dance contest later that same year. Neither Northam nor Eastern Virginia Medical School has been able to confirm who is in the picture or how it wound up on the future governor\u2019s yearbook page, and Northam has said he was in shock and trying to do the right thing when he apologized for it.\n\nScandals quickly enveloped the other two Democrats in the executive branch \u2014 two women came forward to accuse Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexually assaulting them in the early 2000s, which he denies; and Attorney General Mark Herring admitted wearing blackface to imitate a rapper at a college party in 1980. But Northam\u2019s downfall seemed at the time especially toxic for his party\u2019s hopes in elections this fall.\n\nAll 140 seats in the General Assembly are on the Nov. 5 ballot. The balance of power is at stake, with Republicans clinging to razor-thin majorities of 51 to 48 in the House of Delegates and 20 to 19 in the Senate, with one vacancy in each chamber.\n\nNortham\u2019s fundraising ability evaporated overnight. He stopped making public appearances. Republicans hardly had to say anything as virtually all of the state\u2019s Democrats \u2014 led by the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus \u2014 called on Northam to resign.\n\nSix months later, the environment is sharply different. Several recent public polls have found that Virginians do not like Northam as much as before but approve of the job he is doing. Northam scored 37 percent approval vs. 29 percent disapproval among possible Virginia voters in a Roanoke College poll conducted last month. That was on track with the results of a Virginia Commonwealth University poll from June that found 37 percent approval among Virginia adults.\n\nThe VCU poll found that minorities were more likely to approve of Northam\u2019s performance, at 44 percent, than whites, at 33 percent approval and 32 percent disapproval.\n\nNortham\u2019s term expires in 2022, and he is prohibited by law from seeking a second consecutive term.\n\nThe governor is far less toxic than President Trump, who continues to cast a shadow over Virginia Republicans with his low approval ratings in the state. The Roanoke College poll found that 27 percent of potential Virginia voters approved of Trump, vs. 53 percent who disapproved.\n\n[Jamestown ceremony marks birth of democracy in America; black Va. legislators skip because of Trump]\n\nOfficials in both parties, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy, said their internal polling shows similar results: Northam is not beloved, but he is solid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the same rebound in numbers in job approval even if his image isn\u2019t that great,\u201d the Republican strategist said.\n\nLooking around the state, this person said, Northam\u2019s personal image took a beating among voters in the Richmond region but has strongly rebounded, while experiencing less of a dip in Hampton Roads. His image suffered the most in Northern Virginia, the strategist said, \u201cbut the environment [there] is overwhelmingly Democratic, so it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\n\nAcross all those regions, though, job approval has been solid, \u201cand voters care more about that and less about personal image,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nAnother Republican involved with several campaigns said, \u201cAs Republican campaigns start to develop, you\u2019re going to see them focus more on the kitchen-table-type issues than on Ralph Northam.\u201d\n\nOne way Republicans are making use of the Northam scandal is calling out Democrats for taking donations from him when many of them had called on him to resign.\n\nNortham\u2019s political action committee has given about $350,000 to candidates and to the party\u2019s combined campaign. While his numbers are lower than a sitting governor might usually produce \u2014 the PAC of his predecessor, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), gave 10 times that amount in the 2015 legislative races \u2014 Northam has seen the spigot turn back on after it went dry in February, according to a person familiar with his fundraising.\n\nState Sen. Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., running in a competitive district in the Richmond suburbs, has repeatedly pressed his opponent to explain why she accepted $25,000 from Northam\u2019s PAC after calling for him to resign.\n\n\u201cNortham Bought Her Silence,\u201d one of the incumbent\u2019s campaign mailers said, next to a reprint of the racist yearbook photo.\n\nHis opponent, Democrat Ghazala Hashmi, called for Northam\u2019s resignation in the general flurry of early February. Asked this week whether she has reconsidered, Hashmi did not directly answer:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to have his support for our shared goal of flipping this Senate District so we can work together to bring down the cost of healthcare and better fund our schools,\u201d she said via email.\n\nNortham has held fundraisers for candidates in Hampton Roads \u2014 parts of which he once represented in the state Senate \u2014 and for the opponents of two powerful Republicans: House Speaker Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights) and Appropriations Committee Chairman Chris Jones (R-Suffolk). Cox and Jones had been personally close with Northam but have been estranged since the scandals.\n\n[In Virginia, redrawn districts test Republicans, including House Speaker Kirk Cox]\n\nNortham was warmly received at the annual Labor Day picnic hosted by Rep. Robert C. \u201cBobby\u201d Scott (D-Va.), according to people who attended. Scott is African American and appeared with Northam at last month\u2019s commemoration of the 400th anniversary of Africans arriving in bondage at what is now Fort Monroe. He, too, has called for Northam to resign. His campaign did not respond to requests for comment Friday.\n\nNortham has been on a quest to repair his standing with African Americans since February. He drew several standing ovations for his remarks at the Fort Monroe ceremonies, highlighting a commitment to fighting for racial equity and improving public understanding of black history.\n\n[Virginia marks the dawn of American slavery in 1619 with solemn speeches and songs]\n\nHis supporters say those efforts, as well as his attempt to get the General Assembly to take up gun-control measures in the wake of the May 31 mass shooting in Virginia Beach, have helped improve Northam\u2019s political stature.\n\nA measure of that change came last week when Northam attended a symposium at Virginia Union University in Richmond. Six months ago, Northam canceled an appearance there after students protested.\n\nThis time, students and faculty members welcomed Northam to a panel discussion about the role of historically black colleges and universities. After a few brief words of thanks, Northam spent the hour-plus event as a spectator, occasionally taking notes.\n\n\u201cToday he may have been exposed to something that helps him understand African Americans,\u201d VUU President Hakim Lucas said in an interview, \u201cparticularly the young people who will be voting in this next election cycle.\u201d\n\nLaura Vozzella contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The Democrat is playing a surprising positive role in a key election year.", "authors": ["Gregory S.
