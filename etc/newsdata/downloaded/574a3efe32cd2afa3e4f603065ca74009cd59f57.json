A moratorium on executions has been in place since last year, shortly after the new government took power.\n\nAmnesty urged the government to take the first step towards total abolition by eliminating the mandatory death penalty entirely, including for drug-related offences, when it puts forward the new legislation.\n\nIt said 73 percent of those on death row were convicted of drug crimes.\n\nThe Malaysian law minister's office did not have an immediate response to the report.", "description": "Malaysian police sometimes use torture to extract confessions from suspects in death penalty cases and their trials are often unfair, Amnesty International said Thursday, piling pressure on the government to abolish capital punishment.
