It is just a little thing which usually settles in the two weeks [Matip] had; it did, but then it came up after the United game and so now we just have to make sure this time it settles finally, that\u2019s all.\n\n\"It is not a massive injury, it\u2019s just a bit annoying for him and he cannot do it [face Genk].\"\n\nAlexander-Arnold is expected to be fit in time for Sunday's match at Anfield which will be the first time the Reds have faced Tottenham since their Champions League final showdown in June.\n\nBoth sides had high-scoring wins in the competition this week, with Spurs beating Red Star Belgrade 5-0 and Liverpool getting a 4-1 victory in Belgium.\n\nTwo goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain put the Reds in a commanding position against Genk, before Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah added to the tally, followed by a late consolation for the hosts.", "description": "The Reds defender was substituted an hour into the Champions League clash with Genk on Wednesday", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20711819.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KRC-Genk-v-Liverpool-FC-Group-E-UEFA-Champions-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
