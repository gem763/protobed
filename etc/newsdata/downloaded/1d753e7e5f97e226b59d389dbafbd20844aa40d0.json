If CCP cadres use their economic leverage over Hong Kong executives to stifle dissent against China, what\u2019s stopping them from doing the same to American, European, or Japanese managers worldwide? Here we find what may be the darkest side of the integration of authoritarian China into the global economy. Companies from Starbucks to Apple have become heavily reliant on Chinese consumers to drive revenue growth, and it is not unreasonable to think that Beijing could capitalize on those business interests to impose its political views on the world.\n\nRead: A defining moment for Trump\u2019s foreign policy\n\nTo an extent, Beijing already has. It\u2019s become almost routine for Hollywood producers to scrub scripts of anything that might offend thin-skinned Chinese censors and prevent a film from showing in lucrative Chinese theaters. Companies that accidentally tread on Chinese political sensitivities\u2014by, for instance, including Taiwan among countries on their websites (Beijing considers the island part of China)\u2014bring its ire upon them. Amid the Hong Kong scrape, Versace and Coach had to issue groveling apologies after angry Chinese perceived that they were listing the city as independent from China on their products.\n\nBut the case of Sy\u2019s firing shows that Beijing is turning up the heat further still. The CCP is intervening directly in the staffing decisions of firms, pitting managers against their own employees, and enforcing Beijing\u2019s wishes in an area beyond the direct control of China\u2019s surveillance state.\n\nNo company has come under greater distress than Cathay Pacific. Earlier this month, China\u2019s aviation authority ordered the airline to remove any cabin crew involved in Hong Kong\u2019s protests from flights to the mainland, claiming that such a step was meant to \u201cimprove flight safety and security.\u201d Not complying was really not much of an option. Though Cathay Pacific is a major international carrier that flies everywhere from New York to New Delhi, a substantial part of its business is funneling passengers to China, especially on planes operated by its subsidiary Cathay Dragon.\n\nThe Chinese edict threw the airline into turmoil. Several days later, Rupert Hogg, Cathay\u2019s CEO, warned employees that the company had \u201ca zero-tolerance approach to illegal activities\u201d and threatened that staff participating in demonstrations could face termination. The airline quickly suspended a pilot involved in the protests. Hogg himself became a victim, unexpectedly resigning to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for the airline\u2019s woes.\n\nRead: Hong Kong\u2019s new reality\n\nThen came Sy\u2019s sudden sacking. She claims that she was fired in a meeting with airline representatives after confirming that screenshots of Facebook posts were from her account, though she said she was given no explanation for her dismissal. (Later, Sy admitted publicly to posting pro-protest material on her Facebook page.) A Hong Kong union group called Sy's firing a \u201cblatant act of suppression.\" Why Sy was outright fired rather than reassigned to work that would not take her to China remains unclear. When I posed this question to a Cathay spokesman, the company replied in a statement that \u201cwe cannot comment on individual cases,\u201d but then proceeded to do just that, saying Sy\u2019s dismissal had nothing to do with her activities as the chief of a flight attendants\u2019 union. More generally, the company added that such personnel decisions are based on \u201call relevant circumstances including applicable regulatory requirements and the employee\u2019s ability to perform his/her job.\u201d", "description": "The pressure on Hong Kong executives to suppress dissent could go global.", "authors": ["Michael Schuman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTS2MPUK/facebook.jpg?1566851232"}
