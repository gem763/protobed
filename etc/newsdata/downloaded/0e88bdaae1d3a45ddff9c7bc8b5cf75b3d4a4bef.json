Although the legal challenges were dropped this week, many Saints fans still haven\u2019t stopped complaining about the non-call that prompted the NFL to change its replay review rules in the offseason.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a New Orleans problem,\u201d Rams cornerback Aqib Talib said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an LA problem.\u201d\n\nThe Rams and their fans have a different overriding reflection they\u2019re taking into the teams\u2019 marquee early-season rematch at the Coliseum on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI remember we won,\u201d Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I remember.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Rams reached their first Super Bowl in 17 years after holding the Saints\u2019 high-octane offense to 290 yards and allowing just 10 points after the first quarter. Phillips and his defense will try for a repeat of that excellence against Drew Brees, Alvin Kamara and Michael Thomas, while the Saints\u2019 defense must contend again with Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and the Rams\u2019 quietly devastating corps of receivers.\n\nTheir fans might be another matter, but the Saints (1-0) aren\u2019t wasting time thinking about the Super Bowl that got away. Coach Sean Payton realizes his team got the ball first in overtime, but couldn\u2019t finish.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it was a long time ago,\u201d Payton said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our game. These are two different teams now. A lot of roster moves from last year to this year. We\u2019re playing each other early in the season, so it doesn\u2019t feel like that many games ago \u2026 but you\u2019re looking at two different teams.\u201d\n\nThey might be different, but they\u2019re both expected to be major contenders in the NFC again this year. The Rams\u2019 home opener will allow one team to set a tone in the conference race.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re taking from last year as motivation,\u201d Goff said. \u201cIf they are, great. It\u2019s just another game for us, and it\u2019s our home opener after not being at home for a long time.\u201d\n\nHere are more things to know about the rematch:\n\nHOLDING THE LINE\n\nThe Saints\u2019 offensive line passed its first big test in Week 1, allowing one sack on a linebacker blitz and neutralizing 2018 AFC sacks leader J.J. Watt, holding him without a single significant defensive statistic. The only time Watt influenced the game was when Ryan Ramczyk, his main blocker, was flagged for holding early in the fourth quarter.\n\nNow the Saints must find a way to slow down 2018 NFL sacks leader Aaron Donald. \u201cHe\u2019s got such a high motor,\u201d Brees said. \u201cHe is full-go, all the time. He is so multiple in the things that he can do, the moves that he can give you, the inside, the outside, the rip, the jump. I don\u2019t even have names for all the moves that he can do to get to the quarterback. You cannot block him with one guy. He\u2019s just that good a player. He\u2019s such an impact player. He can change the game. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen anybody like him.\u201d\n\nGURLEY\u2019S GAME\n\nThe concerns about Gurley\u2019s apparently balky knee looked fairly unfounded in the Rams\u2019 opener at Carolina, where he rushed for 97 yards and looked dangerous. The Rams still expect to use backup Malcolm Brown extensively, but Gurley and an offensive line with two new starters appeared to be in solid form so far. Gurley participated in practice on both Wednesday and Thursday this week, not taking a day off to rest.\n\nGUARDING MIKE\n\nThe Rams appeared to find a formula for covering Thomas, the Los Angeles native whose Twitter handle includes the phrase, \u201ccan\u2019t guard Mike.\u201d It took getting burned once to do it. In a 2018 regular- season meeting, Thomas went off for 12 catches for 211 yards, highlighted by a 72-yard touchdown that he celebrated by pulling an old flip phone out of the goal post padding, as former Saints receiver Joe Horn had once done. In that game, Thomas was primarily covered by Marcus Peters. However, the Rams changed their strategy for defending Thomas in a rematch in the NFC title game, using a combination of Peters, Aqib Talib and Robey-Coleman. Thomas had just four catches for 36 yards and no touchdowns in that game.\n\nKUPP CONCERNS\n\nThe Saints didn\u2019t have to cover Cooper Kupp in the previous meeting, but Payton spoke highly of what the receiver adds to the Rams\u2019 offense. \u201cHe is such a smart, instinctive player, he does a lot of things well,\u201d Payton said. \u201cIt is not just in the receiving game. He is blocking. He is putting his hands on guys. \u2026 I think he\u2019s very consistent and a very smart player. I think he brings a lot to what they do.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Rams would like to beat the Saints this time without help from the absence of a flag.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/saints_rams_preview_football_18129_c0-92-2075-1301_s1770x1032.jpg?ef5c5ed56f71dd8e5f9c26e62bf60cef5e0159c7", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
