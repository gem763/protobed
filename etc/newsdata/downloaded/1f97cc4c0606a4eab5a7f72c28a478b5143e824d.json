And Nicholas Castellanos. And Alec Mills.\n\nIt seemed like everyone helped out.\n\nSchwarber hit a three-run homer and made a diving catch in left field, and the Cubs beat the Cincinnati Reds 8-2 on Monday night for their fifth straight victory.\n\nCastellanos added a two-run double in the eighth inning as Chicago moved a season-high 14 games above .500. The Cubs have outscored opponents 59-18 during their streak.\n\n\u201cThis is the time,\u201d Castellanos said. \u201cWe\u2019re facing adversity and we\u2019ve got to stare it down. There\u2019s a lot of guys in this room who\u2019ve got to step up.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs (82-68) pulled within a half-game of Washington for the top spot in the wild-card standings and stayed two games back of NL Central-leading St. Louis, which held off the Nationals for a 4-2 win.\n\nSteve Cishek, Mills (1-0), Rowan Wick, Kyle Ryan and David Phelps combined for 5 2/3 scoreless innings in relief of an ineffective Cole Hamels.\n\nIt was Mills\u2019 first major league win in his 17th big league appearance.\n\n\u201cEvery time he shows up, he does something good for us,\u201d manager Joe Maddon said, \u201cand he does it in a very quiet, professional manner. He\u2019s outstanding.\u201d\n\nIt was Chicago\u2019s first game since Rizzo had an MRI that showed the big first baseman had a moderate lateral right ankle sprain sustained during Sunday\u2019s 16-6 victory over Pittsburgh.\n\nRizzo will wear a walking boot for five to seven days, casting doubt on his availability for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not shutting any doors, but we\u2019re realistic that this is a legitimate injury that under ideal circumstances would take some time to heal,\u201d president of baseball operations Theo Epstein said.\n\nCincinnati (70-81) had won three of four, but the Reds went 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position and left 11 runners on base.\n\n\u201cWe had opportunities early and didn\u2019t get enough out of those,\u201d manager David Bell said. \u201cIt turns out that was kind of the difference.\u201d\n\nKevin Gausman (3-9) pitched two innings in his first start since the Reds claimed him off waivers from the Braves last month. The right-hander has been a starter for most of his career, and Bell wanted to give him another look in that spot while giving the rest of his rotation an extra day of rest.\n\nGausman got into trouble in the first when Chicago put runners on first and second with one out. Schwarber then connected for the second straight day, driving a 2-2 pitch deep to center.\n\n\u201cI kind of put my team in a hole right there,\u201d Gausman said.\n\nIt was No. 37 for Schwarber, the highest total for a lefty batter for the Cubs since Hall of Famer Billy Williams hit 37 in 1972.\n\nSchwarber also robbed pinch hitter Derek Dietrich with a stellar grab on his liner to left in the fourth. Phillip Ervin\u2019s sacrifice fly cut Chicago\u2019s lead to 3-2, but Cishek struck out Eugenio Su\u00e1rez looking to end the inning.\n\nIN-GAME CHANGE\n\nReds infielder Josh VanMeter left in the fourth inning because of a family medical issue. He started at first base after Joey Votto was scratched with an illness.\n\nHE\u2019S HERE\n\nThe Reds promoted infielder Christian Col\u00f3n from Triple-A Louisville. Col\u00f3n was hit by a pitch while batting for Gausman in the third and scored on Curt Casali\u2019s bases-loaded walk. It was Col\u00f3n\u2019s first major league appearance since June 20, 2017, for Miami against Washington.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nReds: SS Jos\u00e9 Iglesias (sore back) was out of the starting lineup. Bell said Iglesias likely will start Tuesday. \u2026 SS Freddy Galvis missed his second straight game with left knee soreness. Bell said Galvis doesn\u2019t have meniscus or ligament damage and won\u2019t be out long-term.\n\nCubs: RH reliever Brandon Kintzler is dealing with a mild left oblique strain. \u2026 Closer Craig Kimbrel (right elbow inflammation) is scheduled to throw a simulated game Tuesday and could return this weekend. \u2026 SS Addison Russell (concussion protocol) hit off a tee before the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Sonny Gray (10-7, 2.80 ERA) faces RHP Yu Darvish (6-6, 3.97 ERA) on Tuesday night in a matchup of two of baseball\u2019s best pitchers since the All-Star break. Gray is 4-1 with a 1.29 ERA in his last eight starts for Cincinnati. Darvish struck out 14 while pitching six scoreless innings in Chicago\u2019s 4-1 victory at San Diego on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Playing without Anthony Rizzo, the Chicago Cubs turned to Kyle Schwarber.
