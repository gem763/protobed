They\u2019re like a knife\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cYou can pretend a couple of times, play a role a bit, but in the end you are what you are,\u201d Rodrigo Hern\u00e1ndez says, and he is a deep midfielder. The way he tells it, player and person are inseparable and everything makes sense. Listening to him talk a little like he plays \u2013 intelligently, thoughtfully, calmly \u2013 it is as if there is an inevitability about it all, an inescapable logic; like this is just what he is and where he was always going to be, even if his story need not have brought him here, to his place: the middle of a football pitch.\n\nRodri sits on a bench on the grass at Spain\u2019s Las Rozas training camp, tracing his journey. He hasn\u2019t come far \u2013 he was raised near here to the north-west of Madrid and began playing just down the road \u2013 but he has come a long way, learning en route. He describes himself as a sponge, soaking it all up, from Madrid to Villarreal and back via a university degree he\u2019s still doing and on to Manchester, where he became the most expensive player in City\u2019s history.\n\nPremier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more\n\nFive times he mentions some of his \u201cbests\u201d \u2013 the best decision he took, the best years of his life, the best atmosphere, best experience, even his best friends \u2013 and none have anything to do with football. Playing professionally wasn\u2019t his grand plan, yet looking back it feels mapped out and even the things that have nothing to do with football ended up having everything to do with becoming the footballer Pep Guardiola most wanted. With being him.\n\n\u201cVery few players are one thing on the pitch and another completely different off it; personality translates,\u201d he says. \u201cHe even looks like a midfielder,\u201d his manager says. When Rodri signed, Guardiola said he would be \u201camazing\u201d, highlighting an abnormal normality: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have tattoos or earrings. And his hair \u2026 he looks like a holding midfielder; a holding midfielder must be like this.\u201d Rodri glances at his arms, and smiles. \u201cIf you like tattoos, perfect. But I\u2019m scared. I think: \u2018At 60, I\u2019m going to have this\u2026?\u2019\n\n\u201cI think what Pep meant,\u201d Rodri says, \u201cis that the holding midfielder, more than anyone else, has to maintain order, keep a cool head, and maybe that also means being the most \u2018normal\u2019. Think of those top players \u2013 Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets, Xavi \u2013 they tend to be the \u2018plain\u2019 ones. You can choose between doing what\u2019s best for the team or what showcases what you can do. Forwards get the spotlight, which is understandable because the hardest thing is scoring goals, but there\u2019s work behind that which has to be done. Those players understood. Everything I do for the team is good for me. I\u2019m like that off the pitch.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rodrigo, left, and Patrick Cutrone tussle for the ball during Manchester City\u2019s defeat by Wolves.

Spain might not have always had the most skilful players, virtuosos, but they had the most intelligent.\u201d\n\nWith Rodri, that\u2019s nature and nurture. The son of an engineer and a businesswoman, he went to an international school, speaks excellent English and joined Atl\u00e9tico at 11. \u201cTheir training ground was near and I could get there by bus,\u201d he says simply. Some days, his coach would see him at the stop and give him a lift. En route, they would dissect the game. \u201cThat\u2019s not normal in a boy his age,\u201d Fran Alcoy recalled; Rodri admitted he was more interested in understanding the game than just enjoying it.\n\n\u201cFran showed me how to play. He was the first to put me in this position and say: \u2018This is how to play this role.\u2019 I was only 12, but at that age you really take things on board. I\u2019d always enjoyed watching football and it\u2019s true I found it easy to understand, to read the game; when a team was successful, I could see why, how they created space. \u2018This player\u2019s going to do this, that player will do that.\u2019 It\u2019s not easy to translate that to the pitch but that vision of how a holding midfielder should play, interpret the game, was something I had from a young age. Fran made it easy for me.\u201d\n\nYour parents, too? \u201cWell, my dad was a football fan,\u201d Rodri says, laughing, \u201cbut he\u2019d tell me to keep the ball more, dribble more, shoot more, be a bit greedier. And I\u2019d be like: \u2018Dad, that\u2019s not my role\u2019. He urged me to get forward because the fun part is scoring, but I\u2019d say: \u2018I like doing this; it\u2019s what I\u2019m good at.\u2019 My parents\u2019 role was vital: they kept things in perspective, didn\u2019t let me get wound up or obsessed, and I take that tranquility on to the pitch. The plan was always to study, too.\u201d\n\nRight up to the day he made his debut, and beyond. Released by Atl\u00e9tico, Rodri joined Villarreal. He also enrolled at university, reading business in Castell\u00f3n, and moved into a hall of residence. \u201cThe best years of my life so far,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents suggested going into halls and it was brilliant. There\u2019s a good, happy atmosphere, people your age from all over. I met my girlfriend there. One of the best experiences I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nThe student life, eh? Rodri laughs. \u201cThe best atmosphere in the world! No, no. I\u2019d go for dinner and a drink but obviously not the after-hours stuff. I was the lame guy who never did anything, haha. People didn\u2019t understand; then when I started playing for the [Villarreal] first team they began to. Some didn\u2019t even know, then they\u2019d see me play.\u201d First\u2011team football didn\u2019t mean shelving the books. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal challenge now more than anything, the time invested. I want the pride of finishing. It\u2019s harder because of the distance. I have to go back for exams.\n\n\u201cObviously, football takes over, but studying is a healthy distraction. You\u2019re dedicated to football 24 hours, but you need to clear your head occasionally: it\u2019s intense and, particularly at this level, you can\u2019t afford mistakes. If you think continually about a defeat, if you don\u2019t occupy your mind with anything else, you might pay for it. It\u2019s good to be informed too: we live in a bubble, but my best friends are mostly from school and university and it\u2019s good to put yourself in [other people\u2019s] skin. The problem is in football one day you\u2019re here, the next day you\u2019re far away. It\u2019s more difficult to maintain relationships, but I try.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rodri facing Borussia Dortmund during his time at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Photograph: NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nHe\u2019s even further away now. The decision to leave Villarreal and join Atl\u00e9tico, a club with a footballing identity seemingly opposed to his was deliberate: he wanted to learn from Diego Simeone, developing qualities he lacked, and his adaptability was summed up in a stat: the player who completed the most passes became the player who completed the most tackles. He was a hybrid; a classic positional midfielder built for the modern game. He was ready for City, seemingly the perfect fit.\n\nBut, Rodri admits, England is totally different. He says he has never quite had this role where he is often alone, the other midfielders way ahead of him. Elbows fly, there isn\u2019t a second to think, the rhythm is higher, the refereeing different, and he finishes games \u201cdead\u201d, he admits. \u201cPeople said: \u2018You can rest [after Simeone]\u2019. Bloody hell, not at all.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the results. \u201cIt\u2019s pointless beating Watford 8-0 then losing the next game,\u201d he says, and especially with Liverpool reducing the margin for error to the minimum. \u201cI touched down to find one of the best teams I\u2019ve seen in recent years,\u201d Rodri says. \u201cLiverpool get seen as a counterattacking team, but they dominate, score from set-plays, the attacking mechanisms are well-worked, they have variety. Klopp\u2019s teams are tough, physical. They go at you like animals. They\u2019re like a knife: one comes at you, then another. But every team has their bad moment and we have to be there [if they do].\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cNobody likes to lose, still less with our demands and Guardiola isn\u2019t going to settle for defeat but he knows how to keep calm and lift the group, not \u2018killing\u2019 the team. We know the situation we\u2019re in: we\u2019ve had players out, we\u2019ve played a lot of games and maybe that\u2019s taking its toll. He\u2019ll work on what we have to improve. We\u2019re better when we rob the ball in the opposition\u2019s half; when we press, we have to deal better with counters.\u201d\n\nThat means him, lessons still there to be learned. \u201cWe\u2019re very offensive; we need a player who defends as well as attacks. It\u2019s one of the most important roles in the team; it\u2019s important to control what happens when attacks end, but it\u2019s not just without the ball. If you take the initiative, you\u2019re constantly moving. One of the things I have to improve is having the patience to wait for the right moment against teams that defend deep and we can\u2019t penetrate. And when you lose the ball, you have to leap like mad to get it back so we can keep attacking, keep attacking, keep attacking because this team never stops.\u201d\n\nIt is some responsibility. \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s my role. It\u2019s why I came.\u201d It\u2019s also who he is.", "description": "Manchester City\u2019s record signing tells Sid Lowe about his fear of tattoos, still being at university and where he and his teammates need to improve", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69eef40c0b5afde9cdb3b15ca98151064574390/0_166_4754_2852/master/4754.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be3bcfdf1fb700237fce4b44e488a9ee", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
