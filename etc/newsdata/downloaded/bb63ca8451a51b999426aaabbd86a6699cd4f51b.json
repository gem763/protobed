REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nBanks, insurers and asset managers in Britain currently have free rein in seeking customers, investors and markets across the EU, helping to maintain London\u2019s standing as a top global financial centre.\n\nBut with Brexit potentially only two weeks away, it is not clear exactly how much EU access Britain\u2019s financial sector will be able to retain.\n\nBritain and the EU are locked in talks on a divorce settlement they hope to conclude at an EU summit on Thursday.\n\nBritain\u2019s parliament, due to hold a special session on Saturday, would have to endorse any deal.\n\nThese are the scenarios faced by financiers as the clock ticks down to Brexit Day on October 31:\n\nTHIRD EXTENSION\n\nBritain has already extended its Brexit deadline twice to October 31. Another extension would allow the finance industry in Britain to maintain full access to the EU until a new Brexit date.\n\nBritain\u2019s Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for another extension. But parliament has passed a law requiring Britain to make a request for an extension if no deal is agreed.\n\nMore than 300 banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain have already opened new EU hubs to ensure continuity of service with European customers whatever form Brexit takes.\n\nThe two Brexit extensions have slowed down the relocation of jobs and activities, such as share trading, from London to new bases in the EU, despite pressure from EU regulators for Britain\u2019s financial firms to put more boots on the ground.\n\nAnother lengthy extension would be likely to put the brakes on the shifting of more business from London to EU centres such as Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Dublin.\n\nA DEAL\n\nA divorce settlement between Britain and the EU would mean business as usual for the financial sector during a fixed transition period.\n\nAn earlier draft withdrawal agreement included a transition phase until the end of 2020 to allow time for new trading arrangements between Britain and the EU to be slotted into place.\n\nAfter this transition period, the EU has said that market access for Britain\u2019s financial sector would be based on the bloc\u2019s \u201cequivalence\u201d regime.\n\nUnder this system, Brussels grants direct access to EU markets if it deems that Britain\u2019s financial rules are aligned closely enough with those in the EU.\n\nThe process, which is also used by financial firms in Japan, Singapore and the United States, can be long and complex.\n\nThe EU has said that if there is a Brexit deal it could fast-track approval of UK equivalence in 2020 to avoid a gap in trading terms after the transition period ends.\n\nBut equivalence offers only patchy and unpredictable direct access, which is why so many UK-based firms have set up in the EU. And this has raised questions about how beneficial equivalence will be in practice.\n\nEquivalence would also require Britain to stay aligned to EU rules when UK financial regulators do not want their hands tied.\n\nBritish regulators do not want to become \u201crule takers\u201d, unable to diverge from EU regulations to tackle new risks that might develop in the UK\u2019s financial sector.\n\nNO-DEAL\n\nFailure to reach a Brexit deal this week, or a refusal to request an extension would potentially mean Britain crashes out of the EU, causing turmoil in financial markets.\n\nThere will not be a regulatory vacuum for banks, asset managers and insurers in Britain in a no-deal scenario because the government has put all existing EU rules into UK law.\n\nBut no deal would mean only limited direct access to the EU, and then largely via temporary measures, fragmenting markets and relationships built up over decades and raising costs for investors.\n\nAnd a no-deal Brexit could delay equivalence decisions by Brussels, leaving Britain\u2019s financial sector more isolated from the EU.\n\nBritain, the EU and EU member states have agreed that some cross-border financial activities like asset management and futures trading could continue for a time if there is no deal.\n\nBritain will allow EU banks already operating in the UK to continue on a temporary basis until they obtain permanent authorisation. But the EU has not reciprocated for UK banks operating in the bloc, meaning the lenders could face an overnight rupture in EU business.\n\nSwapping personal data cross-border could be disrupted because the EU has yet to deem that standards in Britain for protecting privacy are \u201cadequate\u201d.\n\nWithout this, it could be illegal for an EU firm to do business with a UK counterpart if a customer\u2019s personal data is involved.\n\nLondon is the main centre for clearing financial instruments known as interest rate swaps denominated in euros, but under a no-deal Brexit this would end for EU customers in March 2020.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Canary Wharf financial district in London, Britain, June 25, 2019 REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nAfter March next year, customers would then have to shift trillions of euros in contracts from London unless the EU agreed to a clearing extension.\n\nSwathes of trading in euro-denominated shares in London could move to new platforms that have set up in Amsterdam and Paris to ensure continued EU access.\n\nEuropean government bond trading has already moved, but London would retain its dominance in spot currency trading because this market is not regulated.", "description": "Britain's financial services industry, the country's biggest tax earner, risks being cut adrift from its main export market - the European Union - after Brexit.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441509828&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1C6", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
