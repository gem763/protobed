Trump used a meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella to focus on a trade deficit with the EU that stood at $109 billion in 2018.\n\nTrump insisted that the U.S. couldn\u2019t lose a tariff war with the European Union because he says the trade imbalance is so great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very tough situation for us for many years. But now it\u2019s a very tough situation for them because I can remedy the situation very easily. And there really is not any financial counterattack. Hopefully, I don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also used a news conference with Mattarella to urge Italy to increase its defense spending. Trump says Italy is spending only 1.1% of its gross domestic product on defense, short of a goal set by NATO allies during the Obama administration of spending 2%. Trump said he was pleased, however, that Italy has agreed to purchase 90 \u201cbrand-new, beautiful F-35s,\u201d a fighter jet produced by Lockheed Martin LMT, +0.02% .\n\nThe leaders spoke at the White House after meetings that were expected to focus on trade, digital taxes and countering Chinese trade practices they consider unfair.\n\nMattarella said trade tensions were to the benefit of no one and described tariffs as \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d\n\nThe World Trade Organization has formally given the go-ahead for the United States to impose trade sanctions. The EU won a similar WTO case accusing the U.S. of illegally subsidizing Boeing, but a ruling allowing possible retaliation is still months off.\n\nMattarella called on the two sides to meet and try to work out their differences.\n\n\u201cThere may be tariffs in six months\u2019 time concerning the subsidies given to Boeing,\u201d Mattarella warned through an interpreter. \u201cThis is a mere race between tariffs and mutual tariffs.\u201d\n\nThe two also discussed tensions in the Middle East. Mattarella said Italy was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d with Turkey\u2019s offensive in northeastern Syria. Vice President Mike Pence is set to depart later Wednesday for Turkey to try to negotiate a cease-fire after Turkey began attacking Kurdish fighters and civilians in Syria.\n\nThe two leaders did agree on their support for Italian native Christopher Columbus, though. Columbus Day was on Monday, but some cities and states instead recognize Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day over concerns that Columbus helped launch centuries of genocide against indigenous populations in the Americas.\n\n\u201cTo me, it will always be called Columbus Day,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like that. I do.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump voiced confidence Wednesday that the U.S. could not lose a tariff war with the European Union as the U.S. prepares to impose trade...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT453_trumpi_ZG_20191016165539.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
