US and European equity futures declined, while shares in Asia were mostly lower.\n\nOil posted its biggest ever intraday jump to more than $71 a barrel after a strike on a Saudi Arabian oil facility removed about 5% of global supplies, an attack the US has blamed on Iran.\n\nIn an extraordinary start to trading on Monday, London\u2019s Brent futures leapt almost $12 in the seconds after the open, the most in dollar terms since they were launched in 1988. Prices have since pulled back about half of that initial surge of almost 20%, but were still heading for the biggest advance in more than three years.\n\nBy 07:00 on Monday morning, Brent crude was 10% higher and West Texas Intermediate added about 9%. Gold added 1.1% to $1,504.55 an ounce.\n\nNews of the devastating attack on the world\u2019s largest crude exporter also sent currencies of commodity-linked nations higher, including the Norwegian krone and the Canadian dollar.

Trump said the US is \u201clocked and loaded depending on verification\u201d that Iran staged the attack on major Saudi Arabian oil facilities.
