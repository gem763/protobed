(AP Photo/Ghaith Alsayed)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The helicopters flew low and fast into the night, ferrying U.S. special forces to a compound where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hiding in Syria. Half a world away, President Donald Trump watched the raid in real time via a video link as troops blasted into the hideout and sent the most-wanted militant running the last steps of his life.\n\nThe daring raid was the culmination of years of steady intelligence-gathering work \u2014 and 48 hours of hurry-up planning once Washington got word that al-Baghdadi would be at a compound in northwestern Syria.\n\nThe night unfolded with methodical precision and unexpected turns. This reconstruction is based on the first-blush accounts of Trump and other administration officials eager to share the details of how the U.S. snared its top target, as well observations from startled villagers who had no idea al-Baghdadi was in their midst.\n\n___\n\nA CELEBRATION AND A SECRET TWO-DAY SCRAMBLE\n\nEvents developed quickly once the White House learned on Thursday there was \"a high probability\" that al-Baghdadi would be at an Idlib province compound.\n\nBy Friday, Trump had military options on his desk.\n\nBy Saturday morning, the administration at last had \"actionable intelligence\" it could exploit.\n\nThere was no hint of that interior drama as Trump headed to Camp David on Friday night to celebrate the 10th wedding anniversary of daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Then he was off to Virginia on a brisk fall Saturday for a round at one of his golf courses.\n\nHe teed off with Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, in town for the World Series, and Sens. Lindsey Graham and David Perdue.\n\nTrump got back to the White House at 4:18 p.m. By 5 p.m., he was in a suit in the Situation Room in the basement of the West Wing to monitor the raid. They named it after Kayla Mueller, an American humanitarian worker abused and killed by al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe rest of Washington had its focus on Game 4 of the World Series about to get underway a few miles away at Nationals Park.\n\n___\n\nPANIC THEN DEATH\n\nMoments after the White House team had gathered, U.S. aircraft, mostly twin-rotor CH-47 helicopters, took off from Al-Asad air base in western Iraq.\n\nWithin hours, al-Baghdadi was dead.\n\nThe first inkling that something was afoot came when villagers saw helicopters swooping low on the horizon.\n\n\"We went out in the balcony to see and they started shooting, with automatic rifles. So we went inside and hid,\" said an unidentified villager. Next came a large explosion \u2014 Trump said soldiers blasted a hole in the side of a building because they feared the entrance might have been booby-trapped. Al-Baghdadi fled into a network of underground bunkers and tunnels that snaked through the compound.\n\nThe stout, bearded militant leader wore a suicide vest and dragged along three children as he fled from the American troops.\n\nTrump, happy to play up the drama, said that as U.S. troops and their dogs closed in, the militant went \"whimpering and crying and screaming all the way\" to his death.\n\n\"He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down,\" Trump said. \"He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.\"\n\n___\n\n'IT WAS HIM'\n\nAl-Baghdadi's body was mutilated in the blast, and the tunnel caved in on him. To get to his corpse, troops had to dig through debris.\n\n\"There wasn't much left,\" Trump said, \"but there are still substantial pieces that they brought back.\"\n\nThat's when the military raid turned into a forensics operation \u2014 and the special forces had come prepared.\n\nThey had brought along samples of al-Baghdadi's DNA.\n\nThe soldiers who conducted the raid thought the man who fled looked like al-Baghdadi, but that wasn't enough. Various accounts had heralded his death in the past, only for him to surface yet again.\n\nThis time there could be no doubt.\n\nLab technicians conducted an onsite DNA test to make sure and within 15 minutes of his death, positively identified the target.\n\n\"It was him,\" Trump said.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's body wasn't all they retrieved.\n\nTrump said U.S. troops remained in the compound for about two hours after al-Baghdadi's death and recovered highly sensitive material about the Islamic State group, including information about its future plans.\n\nAfter the American troops retreated, U.S. fighter jets fired six rockets at the house, leveling it.", "description": "The helicopters flew low and fast into the night, ferrying U.S. special forces to a compound where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hiding in Syria.
