of 90 per cent of his belongings", "language": "en", "text": "Get the biggest celebs stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could

him.\n\nAnd yet ask Nick \u2013 who has been single for three years after splitting from second wife Jessica, with whom he shares a son, Eddie, five \u2013 about his life away from the cameras and it quickly becomes apparent he is most content at home in the solitude of the Cotswolds countryside.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the ladies\u2019 man image he normally gets tagged with.\n\nNick paints the picture of an idyllic lifestyle, which sees him hunting for dragons in the woods and planting vegetables with Eddie.\n\n\u2018Home life is good,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I never talk or comment on my private life, but I am happy.'\n\n'Work is good, too.'\n\n'I am happy bumbling along.'\n\n'I am living where I want to live in the world with a simpler life now.'\n\n(Image: Paul Poynter)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n'I moved to a much smaller house and I got rid of 90% of my belongings that I never bothering to look at.'\n\n'It was great.'\n\n'Yesterday is of no interest to me \u2013 what is happening tomorrow is.'\n\n'I look back at my old special childhood moments and I can remember happily going to my uncle\u2019s house to pop the pea pods we had grown.'\n\n'I want to recreate those moments for Eddie \u2013 It\u2019s not about the expensive things.\u2019\n\nDespite embracing a slower lifestyle, Nick\u2019s work ethic is still second to none.\n\nHe has just finished working three weeks back-to-back with no breaks.\n\n\u2018I am probably going as fast as I was 10 years ago,\u2019 he chuckles.\n\n\u2018But I think part of it is down to the fact I grew up on a council estate and I always assume it\u2019s going to end tomorrow.'\n\n'I have to look after my family, and so I have to get on with it.\u2019\n\nNick does his best to ensure work doesn\u2019t take over completely, so he can spend more time with his youngest son.\n\n(Image: James Gourley/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBut like many working parents, the dad of four \u2013 Tyrian, 27, Tuesday, 25, Charlie, 23, and Eddie \u2013 confides he is constantly wrestling with getting the life/work balance right.\n\n\u2018When my youngest is around, he is the one who needs to see me the most at the moment,\u2019 says Nick.\n\n\u2018I like to see the rest of the family as often as I can, too.'\n\n'Every person who works has this dilemma.'\n\n'How much should you work to improve the standard of living for your family versus seeing your kids grow up?\u2019\n\nBut it\u2019s having a younger son again that has helped give him a great deal of perspective.\n\n\u2018I absolutely love my time with all my kids,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018They have all got a great sense of humour \u2013 Eddie loves noticing the rainbow colours in a puddle, and it\u2019s nice for me to take the time to stop and look at it, too'.\n\n'The world is the most fantastic theme park, but we are often too busy getting to the next appointment, and end up missing the rides along the way.\u2019\n\nPassionate about many causes, including the Child Bereavement UK charity and those supporting ex-military, Nick says he does feel lucky that all his own children are safe and well \u2013 particularly when he experiences first hand the hardship faced by thousands through his Children In Need projects.\n\n\u2018Of course it makes me hug them more,\u2019 he explains.\n\n\u2018But I\u2019m also very aware that we are all only a couple of incidents away from our children being in those situations'.\n\n'A big accident or illness could change everything, and suddenly you are the one in that position.'\n\n'When you are in a good position and are able to make a difference, you should.'\n\n'It is very important for me to do that.\u2019\n\nNick is definitely making a difference for this year\u2019s Children In Need, as he sets about renovating an old Victorian hall in Blackburn and turning it into a centre for young homeless people.\n\nAnd just as millions of us reach for the tissues every time we watch emotional scenes during his hit series DIY SOS, Nick admits that he often cries, too.\n\n\u2018I do get emotional,\u2019 he confides.\n\n\u2018I do it off screen.'\n\n'The programme is about the people who are having the project built for them and the builders/volunteers who have done it.'\n\n'You don\u2019t need a TV presenter bawling!'\n\n(Image: Neil@neilsherwood.com)\n\n'When I do get emotional, I leave the cameras.'\n\n'It\u2019s the people\u2019s moment \u2013 not mine.'\n\n'I absolutely love doing the programme as it gives us all a bit of hope that people are nicer than they think they are.'\n\n'Because of our political situation, there is this narrative that we are all against each other.'\n\n'Yet on DIY SOS, everywhere we go, we ask people to work for free and donate for free \u2013 this is not a country that has no sense of community.\u2019\n\nAnd this sense of community, which sees builders give up their free time to drive in from all over the UK just to lend a hand, is the reason why Nick will never stop working on the programme.\n\n\u2018I get paid a lot more to do the quiz shows than DIY SOS,\u2019 he reveals.\n\n\u2018But this is the one I don\u2019t want to give up, because I chose to make this type of programme and I want to because it\u2019s important.\u2019\n\nAt 57, Nick is also fully aware of the importance of being healthy.\n\nHe tends to follow a mostly plant-based diet and tries to go to the gym as much as he can.\n\n\u2018But I am on my feet all day with DIY SOS, and so that keeps me fairly fit,\u2019 he adds.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\n\u2018I am not fully vegan \u2013 I have never gone the whole hog, and do eat some meat, but I try to keep myself in decent nick.\u2019\n\nWith a string of other TV hits under his belt, including I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026Get Me Out Of Here! and Who Dares Wins, Nick shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nHe now has a non-exclusive contract with the BBC, which means he can work for other channels.\n\nIt\u2019s a prospect that excites him.\n\nWith previous forays into music (when he was in the jungle, his cover of Make You Feel My Love topped the charts) and cookbooks, Nick says he would love to make some more history and movie programmes in the future.\n\nSo, will he become the male equivalent of Mary Berry and work into his 80s?\n\nHe laughs, before pointing out, \u2018Billy on DIY SOS is coming up to 70!\u2019\n\nNick then adds, \u2018I will do \u2013 as long as the BBC keeps funding DIY SOS and people watch it, then I will make it, because it helps people.'\n\n'But one day I\u2019d also love to go to the middle of nowhere and write\u2026\u2019\n\nWe look forward to all those projects very much.\n\n(Image: Neil@neilsherwood.com)\n\nHow do he spend his Sunday?\n\nUp with the lark or a lie-in?\n\nThere used to be a time where you could set off a weapon outside the house and I wouldn\u2019t wake up!\n\nBut when I have Eddie with me, I wake up at the same time as him.\n\nHe then sticks his nose on mine and says, \u2018What do we need to do?\u2019 and I reply, \u2018We need to give each other more space!\u2019\n\nSunday night telly or a movie?\n\nSunday night telly for Peaky Blinders.\n\nI am enough of a fan that it has made me dig out my more vintage suits.\n\nWhen I have my next two weeks off, I am going to shave my hair into a Peaky Blinders haircut!\n\nFry-up or healthy?\n\nThe Knowles\u2019 family scrambled eggs are legendary.\n\nBoth my elder sons and I are very adept at making French-style scrambled eggs, which are just fantastic.\n\nA pint or glass of wine?\n\nI don\u2019t drink beer very much.\n\nI am more of a glass of wine person.\n\nI like both white and red equally.\n\nA Sunday roast or a healthy dish?\n\nDefinitely a roast on a Sunday.\n\nCatch DIY SOS: The Big Build Children in Need Special on BBC1, Wednesday 13 November", "description": "The TV presenter, 57, on why he prefers the simple
