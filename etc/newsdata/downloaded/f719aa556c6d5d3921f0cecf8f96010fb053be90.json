Nadler was first elected to Congress in 1992.\n\nBoylan's challenge is seen by some as another example of a progressive Democrat seeking to unseat a long-serving fellow Democrat, similar to how Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez upset longtime Rep. Joseph Crowley in 2018.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"He's trying to fend off a primary campaign from his opponent,\" Lewandowski claimed of Nadler's decision to hold the hearing while being challenged by Boylan.\n\nThe former Trump aide added he is now strongly considering entering the New Hampshire Republican primary in the hope of challenging two-term Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\n\nLewandowski characterized Shaheen as an ineffective politician who has \"failed\" her constituents in the Granite State, who have \"expected and deserved\" better.\n\n\"If I get into this race, I'm going to win,\" he said, adding he is waiting until October -- and studying his potential GOP primary opponents -- before making the final call.", "description": "Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u00a0has said his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee served to remind\u00a0Americans the Russia investigation was a \"witch hunt.\"", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19260657418274.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
