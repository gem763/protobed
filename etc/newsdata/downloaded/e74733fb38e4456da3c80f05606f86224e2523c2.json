Researchers think one of these refuges, name Wrangel Island, became the last mammoth hold-out; these tusked giants outlived their North American and European counterparts by some 7,000 years before going abruptly extinct.\n\nThat means mammoths as a species lasted far longer than scientists previously thought. When the last woolly mammoth kicked the bucket, the Great Pyramid of Giza had already been built in Egypt.\n\nAccording to a new study, published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, the Wrangel Island inhabitants didn't die of the same causes as other mammoths. Rather, the study authors argue, the isolated animals started to inbreed, which weakened their genetic diversity. The weakened population was then unable to adapt to extreme weather events, which likely caused their sudden, untimely demise.\n\nRead More: Scientists think they finally know why the last woolly mammoths died out\n\nThis photograph shows a mammoth tusk on Wrangel Island.

The population of mammoths that went along for the ride were seemingly spared the global extinction of their species, until about 4,000 years ago when they all disappeared.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of skeletons from Wrangel Island showed that the mammoth population's extinction was \"fairly abrupt\" without any warning signs, according to the study authors.\n\nBut the reason behind this sudden die-off wasn't clear.\n\nA previous study found that the mammoth inhabitants on the other similarly isolated island of St. Paul perished from environmental factors. That island, about 1,000 miles to the south of Wrangel Island in the heart of the Bering Sea, was only 42 square miles in size. By examining fossilized DNA, pollen, and spores, scientists discovered that the St. Paul mammoths had likely run out of fresh water as their tiny island dried up, before finally going extinct 5,600 years ago.\n\nThat story was reflected in the composition of the St. Paul mammoths' bones, which showed drops in certain types of elements just before the creatures went extinct.\n\nLynne Burnett and her daughter Danielle, 11 months, look at a woolly mammoth skeleton up for auction.

Juha Karhu/University of Helsinki\n\nEven just prior to their extinction, the Wrangel Island mammoth's bones showed no signs of dietary or environmental stress \u2014 meaning these creatures died off in the middle of unchanging, if not propitious, ecological conditions on an island that wasn't affected by changing climates.\n\nIn fact, the authors said their study shows that Wrangel Island \"maintained environmental conditions suitable for a typical mammoth ecological niche ... possibly until the present day.\"\n\nSo if a changing environment didn't kill them, what did?\n\nGiven that it seemed unlikely the Wrangel Island mammoths died of thirst or climate change, the researchers sussed out other possible reasons behind the extinction.\n\nIt was unlikely that human hunting contributed to the sudden die-off, the authors wrote, because there's only a single site of human occupation on Wrangel Island, and archaeological evidence show the campsite was used for hunting marine mammals and geese. Plus, the site is dated several hundreds of years or so after the last mammoth disappeared.\n\nA previous genetic analysis of some of the Wrangel Island mammoths revealed that the creatures were interbreeding, which caused a severe loss in genetic diversity.\n\nAnother 2017 study revealed that the island population had shrunk 43-fold compared to previous mainland mammoth population sizes by the time it went extinct. The researcher also showed the mammoths had accumulated \"detrimental\" genetic mutations that diminished the population's ability to survive disease outbreaks, famines, or natural disasters that could cull large numbers at once.\n\nAn illustration shows a group of woolly mammoths roaming the frigid tundra of northern Asia.

Thousands of reindeer on present-day Wrangel Island have perished from similar icing episodes in the past century, according to a 2018 study.\n\n\"These events can be catastrophic to the population and appear to occur fairly often,\" Bocherens and his co-authors concluded.\n\nPerhaps rain-on-snow killed off the last mammoth, too.", "description": "The last of the woolly mammoths died on an Arctic island 4,000 years ago, meaning these animals went extinct much later than scientists once thought.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9ce7127fa74b08f07c9025?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
