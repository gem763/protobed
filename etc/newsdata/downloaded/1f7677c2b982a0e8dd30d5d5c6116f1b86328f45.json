During a panel on Fox News earlier this week, Knowles called the activist, who has Asperger\u2019s syndrome, \u201cmentally ill.\u201d\n\nThunberg blistered her opponents in a Twitter thread in which she asked why her opponents are coming after her with personal attacks instead of addressing the science she is citing.\n\nHere we go again...\n\nAs you may have noticed, the haters are as active as ever - going after me, my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences.\n\nThey come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory.

I guess they must simply feel so threatened by us. -> \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) September 25, 2019\n\nBut don\u2019t waste your time giving them any more attention.\n\nThe world is waking up. Change is coming wether they like it or not.\n\nSee you in the streets this Friday!#fridaysforfuture #schoolstrike4climate #climatestrike #aspiepower \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) September 25, 2019\n\nThunberg spoke at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on Monday, scolding world leaders for ignoring global climate problems and focusing on profits and economic growth instead.\n\nLove HuffPost?
