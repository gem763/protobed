In the first nine months, 3,883 deals valued at $501.2 billion were completed, according to Pitchbook, maintaing the high level of dealmaking recorded in 2018.\n\nHowever, U.S. private equity firms sold fewer companies from their portfolios, as potential acquirers balked amid the market jitters. Buyout firms exited 726 companies valued at $220 billion, down 19.5% year-on-year.\n\n\"Trade war tensions, as well as domestic and international economic disputes, may explain the overall slump in exit activity that we have seen through the third quarter,\" Pitchbook said.
