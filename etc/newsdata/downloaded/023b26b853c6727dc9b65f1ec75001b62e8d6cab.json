Philippe Kjellgren\n\nThe first bad sign, he says, is feeling like you're standing in line \u2014 \"if you go to a hotel in Las Vegas and it's like being in the bus terminal, even though they call themselves a five-star hotel, but there's like 40 people in line before you,\" Kjellgren told Insider, shaking his head at the prospect.\n\nThe full-time traveller has just completed a 912-day trip around the world staying in thousands of hotels to decide which ones to include in his new app, PK's List.\n\nThe app features about 2,200 hotels around the world, ranging from around $150 to upwards of $3,000 per night, all of which have been personally vetted and recommended by Kjellgren.\n\nAny that didn't provide a personal service, however, did not make the cut.\n\nRead more: 31 incredible hotels everyone should stay at in their lifetime, ranked by price\n\nAnother classic but entirely impersonal feature of hotels which Kjellgren hates is being asked for his room number rather than his name when arriving in the restaurant.\n\n\"I think it would be quite that much nicer if they ask for your name instead of a room number, you know, to make it more personal,\" he said.\n\nKjellgren in Byron Bay. Philippe Kjellgren\n\nBut treating guests like actual people is simply part and parcel of good service, the globetrotter says. And that starts at check-in.\n\n\"I think that the check-in process can be a lot better and simpler [than it is in most hotels,]\" Kjellgren said.\n\n\"Everything should be done before you get there. You already provided a credit card and everything.\"\n\nAs far as Kjellgren is concerned, check-in takes an unnecessarily long time \u2014 he believes you should simply hand over your passport and get your keys in return.\n\n\"Everything is prepared,\" he said. \"They know who's coming because you've already provided all of the information.\n\n\"It's the first impression that you get [of a hotel], and it's all about how you're approached when you get there.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nInside Qantas' new first class suites, which come with pre-flight facials, all-you-can-drink kombucha, and designer 'sleeper suits'\n\nThe youngest person to travel to every country says reaching the milestone at age 21 came down to 'a few simple life lessons'\n\n10 under-the-radar destinations everyone should visit in their lives, according to the youngest person to travel to every country", "description": "First impressions count, and Philippe Kjellgren explained to Insider why a hotel's check-in experience says a lot about the establishment.", "authors": ["Rachel Hosie"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d974117695b585d8a0d80bf?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
