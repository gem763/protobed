And O\u2019Rourke\u2019s intense focus on the issue, including events like the one in Denver, has given his faltering campaign new meaning.\n\nBut the \u201cnew meaning\u201d derived from gun control has not led to surge of supporters. Rather, O\u2019Rourke \u201cis polling at 2 percent or 3 percent nationally in the primary.\u201d\n\nPolitico observes: \u201cBarring upheaval in the primary, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s focus on gun control will not make him president.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
