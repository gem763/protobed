At an official UFC media day held Thursday, Dern (7-0 MMA, 2-0 UFC) emphasized she will hit the mark on the scales for her fight against Amanda Ribas (7-1 MMA, 1-0 UFC) on Saturday.\n\nThe two strawweights square off at UFC on ESPN+ 19, which takes place at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla. The card streams on ESPN+.\n\nWhile some fighters are protective of their weight, especially during fight week, Dern wasn\u2019t afraid to share what she saw on the scale when she woke up Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cI woke up this morning at 117, so one more pound to 116 or two to 115,\u201d Dern told MMA Junkie. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019ll do a training today. I had a good breakfast and I probably won\u2019t eat too much the rest of the day just to wake up good.\u201d\n\nThe contest against Ribas will signify the first time Dern has stepped into the cage since giving birth in June. Dern actually credits her pregnancy with her newfound weigh-cut success.\n\nEven if she makes the weight Friday morning, Dern expects to receive criticism. She doesn\u2019t think critics will be willing to let go of the fact that she has missed in the past. Dern said she isn\u2019t going to let the fault-finding get to her.\n\n\u201cI think it will be good and bad because I think they\u2019ll say, \u2018See? She wasn\u2019t focused before,\u201d\u2018 Dern said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to say, \u2018See? She isn\u2019t really a professional athlete because when she wants to, she can make weight.\u2019 Every time I didn\u2019t make weight, I can promise I really wish that I did make weight. I was trying my hardest to make the weight, but I messed up somewhere in the camp or I ate too much one day.\n\n\u201cSomething. In the end it wasn\u2019t coming off. It\u2019s not like I want it more or not, but definitely I think the pregnancy helps me a lot. I think we\u2019ll quiet a lot of people with that, but I know that after they\u2019re are always going to be critics. Like, \u2018See? Her striking isn\u2019t good or something.\u2019 So I\u2019m prepared for anything.\u201d", "description": "Even if she makes weight for her UFC on ESPN+ 19 bout against Amanda Ribas, Mackenzie Dern expects to receive criticism.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mackenzie-dern-ufc-tampa-media-day-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
