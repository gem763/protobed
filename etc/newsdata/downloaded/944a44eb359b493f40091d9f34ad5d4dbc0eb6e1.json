The government's Fire and Disaster Management Agency said late Sunday that 14 people died and 11 were missing as a result of Typhoon Hagibis, while 187 suffered injuries.\n\nIt also said 1,283 homes were flooded and 517 were damaged, partially or totally.\n\nThe typhoon made landfall south of Tokyo on Saturday evening and battered central and northern Japan with torrents of rain and powerful gusts of wind. The typhoon was downgraded to a tropical storm on Sunday.\n\n\n\nGovernment rescue teams dispatched helicopters and boats to reach people stranded in flooded homes Sunday, part of a major rescue effort in wide areas of the country, including Tokyo and surrounding areas.\n\nExperts have warned from the start that assessing the damage is difficult because the flooding has struck about a dozen rivers, causing some of them to spill out in more than one spot.\n\nNews footage showed a rescue helicopter hovering in a flooded area in Nagano Prefecture, after an embankment of the Chikuma River broke, plucking people from the second floor of a home submerged in muddy waters.\n\n\n\nSeveral other rivers had also overflowed, including Tama River near Tokyo, according to NHK.\n\n\n\nAuthorities warned that the risk of mudslides remained.", "description": "The government announced that 14 people died and 11 were missing, while 187 suffered injuries", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/13/4f554cb6-9796-4900-b34a-2e459be421b1/thumbnail/1200x630/604b474a67efdecfaa437fa415dbce1d/ap-19284118350122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
