Johnson, 43, as he returned to his hometown to raise his family after spending years away in big cities.\n\n\u201cWe have a serious problem here,\u201d said Johnson, the county\u2019s emergency management director who has lost four family members to addiction. \u201cAnd we knew we had to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSo he and some of the other townspeople decided to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on that fear this Halloween. They have created a huge haunted house. Only, rather than witches and mummies, it\u2019s a tableau of the nightmare the entire county is enduring \u2014 a journey through drug addiction.\n\nAD\n\nI went to one of their planning meetings on a hot, August evening, in a country classroom.\n\nResidents stood up to introduce themselves and what they were doing for the haunted house: costumes, refreshments, construction, decorations.\n\nEach of them \u2014 from string-bean kids in baseball caps to schoolteachers in sensible shoes \u2014 explained their connection to drug addiction.\n\n\u201cIt got my favorite uncle. It was a really hard loss,\u201d said a kid wearing a baseball cap.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to bury friends younger than me and friends older than me,\u201d said a musician.\n\n\u201cI lost my brother-in-law last year,\u201d said a sports dad.\n\n\u201cI heard the middle-schoolers on our bus talking about how good the heroin is,\u201d said one of the teachers. \u201cMiddle-schoolers.\u201d\n\nNearly all of them knew someone.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the 122 people who overdosed last year \u2014 16 of them fatally \u2014 that frightens folks here. It\u2019s the shocking increase, said Maggie Thomas, who tracks the numbers as director of the county\u2019s Addiction and Prevention Services.\n\nAD\n\nThe haunted house at the Kennard African American Cultural Heritage Center will have scenes from a drug den, a frightening arrest, a court hearing, a jail cell, a wrenching family crisis, a harrowing overdose. They will go into the dark and dirty details of shooting heroin and fentanyl. It\u2019s a walking, shrieking, living, screaming PSA.\n\nAD\n\nThey\u2019re calling it the Haunted Trap House \u2014 an update of their 1989 Haunted Crack House in the county\u2019s old jail.\n\n\u201cDare to experience the chilling story of a girl who gets tangled in the web of addiction,\u201d the posters from that period said.\n\nNever mind that the police chief back then told The Washington Post he remembered just one arrest for crack cocaine in his jurisdiction.\n\nThis time, the town is ground zero for the drug crisis and in a state that is still battling record opioid fatalities.\n\nAD\n\nJust a few months after planning began, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling heroin yards away from the haunted house site.\n\nThirty years ago, Johnson was a 13-year-old kid who played a character in one of the addiction scenes.\n\nAD\n\nHe thought about that as he watched his brother-in-law die of a heroin overdose last year and as he saw his county colleagues respond to call after call for overdoses.\n\n\u201cIn one of our most recent overdoses, the guy still had the needle in his arm when the woman with him called 911 to say he OD\u2019d. Then, she took the needle out of his arm and put it in hers because, she told responders, \u2018it was some good s---,\u2019 \u201d Johnson said.\n\nDozens of people showed up to help with the haunted house. There is a local carpenter who\u2019s tired of reading about all the opioid deaths. There is a drama teacher who has been coaxing the most convincing overdoses out of her volunteers for weeks. There are costume designers, event planners, real police officers who will stage arrests, a real judge to hand down a sentence. They even have real prisoners, who are encouraged to interact with the visitors. It won\u2019t be pretty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGov. Larry Hogan (R), who declared a state of emergency over the opioid crisis in Maryland two years ago, is planning to walk through the haunted house this week, Johnson said. He even got a \u201cmaybe\u201d from first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office.\n\nOnce visitors go through the gut-punch that is an addict\u2019s life, they\u2019ll have the treats, yes, but they will also have counselors on site for anyone who may be moved to seek help.\n\n\u201cIf we can help one person, just one person stops using or doesn\u2019t start using because of this,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cit\u2019s all worth it.\u201d\n\nTickets for the Haunted Trap House, which runs Oct. 24-26 from 7-11 p.m., can be purchased for $3 on eventbrite.com.\n\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\n\nAD", "description": "Witches?
