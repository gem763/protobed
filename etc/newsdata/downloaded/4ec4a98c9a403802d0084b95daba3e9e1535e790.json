The country has disposed of 4.9 trillion yuan ($692.8 billion) of bad loans from 2017 to today, by using different methods.\n\nIn the first three quarters of this year, the disposal of bad loans in China's banking sector reached 1.4 trillion yuan, 176 billion yuan more than the same period a year earlier, according to CBIRC data.\n\n\"We will strictly prevent banks' manipulation of accounts, letting the recorded non-performing loans reflect the real risk level of bank loans,\" said Xiao.\n\nOne of the results of China's tightened financial regulation was the fast shrinking of the \"shadow banking\" business. More than 15 trillion yuan of shadow banking assets have been reduced during the past two years, Xiao said.\n\nThe CBIRC will maintain tight supervision of financial institutions, especially for medium-sized and small ones, and conduct tests to prevent systemic financial risks, he added.\n\nMoody's research has pointed out that China's broad shadow banking assets shrank by about 1.7 trillion yuan in the first half of 2019 to finish at 59.6 trillion yuan, the lowest level since the end of 2016.\n\nThe shadow banking assets fell to 64 percent of nominal GDP by the end of June, down from 68 percent at the end of 2018, compared with the peak of 87 percent at the end of 2016, said the international ratings agency.", "description": "More online peer-to-peer lending companies will close after China's financial regulators imposed strict rules on the industry, to accelerate risk exposure and continually deleverage the financial sector, according to senior officials from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/22/5dae5fb3a310cf3e97a258d1.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
