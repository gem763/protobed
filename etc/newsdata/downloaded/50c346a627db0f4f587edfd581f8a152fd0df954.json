But these can still offer some clues about what to expect.\n\nFront-of-box claims aren\u2019t intended to provide comprehensive information. You\u2019ll want to turn the box over and look at the Drug Facts label for more details. But the tips below can help you make sense of common claims and better understand what you\u2019re buying. If you\u2019re ever in doubt about what a product does or whether it\u2019s safe, ask a pharmacist or your family doctor.\n\nExtra or maximum strength\n\nCompanies use terms like these to signify that there\u2019s more of the active ingredient than in a brand\u2019s regular strength formulation. \u201cThese terms don\u2019t tell you how much more, or how much you should take,\u201d says Barbara A. Paino Keber, chair of family medicine at Northwell Health and chair at Glen Cove Hospital-Northwell Health in Glen Cove, N.Y. For information on dosing and concentration, read the back of the package.\n\nTimed release\n\nUnlike many other terms that appear on the front of OTC drug boxes, \u201ctimed release\u201d actually has a specific meaning that\u2019s regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. That is, in part, because if the release mechanism does not work as intended, it\u2019s possible that a person would receive a dose that is unsafe or ineffective.\n\nA product labeled \u201ctimed release\u201d will release small amounts of active ingredients into the body over a set period of time, rather than all at once.\n\nThough \u201ctimed release\u201d is defined by the FDA, similar-sounding terms such as \u201clong acting\u201d are not. \u201cLong acting\u201d may suggest that a product works for longer \u2014 and that there is a longer time between doses \u2014 compared with immediate-release products. That means you\u2019ll probably need to take fewer pills over a 24-hour period, but you\u2019ll pay for the convenience.\n\n\u201cLong-acting products are generally more expensive,\u201d says Barbara Young, editor of Patient Medication Information for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.\n\nFast-acting/rapid release\n\nThese are often chewable or dissolvable products that may release large amounts of the active ingredient into your body more quickly than other formulations of the same medication.\n\nFast-acting may be particularly helpful in situations where you want urgent relief, such as when you have hives from an allergic skin reaction, Keber says.\n\nNon-drowsy\n\nUsually this means that a product does not contain ingredients that will make you feel sleepy, such as diphenhydramine. It does not mean that a medication will help you to stay alert, though some non-drowsy products may contain ingredients that can act as stimulants in some people, including pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine.\n\nDual action\n\nThe term \u201cdual action\u201d implies that a medication has two or more ingredients with different actions. Combo meds can be a convenient way to treat multiple symptoms \u2014 such as congestion and fever \u2014 but be sure to read the active ingredients section on the Drug Facts label to avoid doubling up on ingredients by mistake, especially if you are using other meds, Keber says.\n\nFor instance, some prescription pain relievers contain acetaminophen, which can also be found in combination cough and cold medicines. Too much acetaminophen can damage the liver.\n\nEasy open/senior-friendly\n\nMost OTC medications come in child-\u00adresistant packaging, which can make them more difficult to open for people with arthritis and other manual dexterity issues. Look for these terms on packaging for easier-to-open containers. \u201cBut also remember to store them safely, out of reach from children and pets,\u201d Young says.\n\nCopyright 2019, Consumer Reports Inc.\n\nRead More\n\nWhat you should know about the side effects of drugs\n\nDigestive problems may respond to diet changes\n\nThe chemicals in sunscreen and your health", "description": "Experts give clear definitions to such terms as \u201cExtra strength\u201d and \u201cDual action.\u201d", "authors": ["Consumer Reports", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dgJXngtUhx0S7Pxn9tEvoWuhezA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WYOVJ6WPGEI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
