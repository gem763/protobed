Photo: Scott Angelheart/NBC\n\nSeth Meyers. Jimmy Fallon. Lilly Singh. One of these things is not like the others (and she\u2019s proud of that). NBC welcomed new late-night host Lilly Singh and her show A Little Late With Lilly Singh last night. She\u2019s taking over Carson Daly\u2019s 1:35 a.m. slot and making it something entirely new. As the only woman, member of the LGBTQ community (\u201cI put B in LGBT, I\u2019ll take Sansa and her brother,\u201d she rapped), and person of color on network late night, Singh is happy to be unique. She tells the jokes Seth can\u2019t tell. Here\u2019s what her new show is all about, complete with clips from the premiere.\n\nOn her YouTube channel, IISuperwomanII, Singh does musical and sketch comedy, so it makes sense that her first show kicked off with a sketch \u2026 that morphed into a musical number. It served as an introduction to who she is, but also the tone the show is going to take: inclusive, progressive, and cheeky. It\u2019s a Donald-free zone, \u201cunless his last name is Glover,\u201d she rapped.\n\nOkay, in case the rap wasn\u2019t clear, this is not Carson Daly. He\u2019s off doing earlier things. For her first monologue, Singh addressed the woman of color in the room (herself) and the women of color who paved the way for her. She emphasized that, yes, she\u2019s different than all the other late-night hosts and, yes, she\u2019s going to lean into it. Her first monologue shied away from the regular news breakdown, which is a nice reprieve from hearing the same Trump jokes across late night.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, her first guest of the night: Rainn Wilson! (Wow, Lilly, if you ever need a Steve Higgins, I am available.) Instead of coming out and doing the normal chitchat segue to a promo, Wilson brought Singh a white noise machine that plays all sorts of things: the sound of Birkenstocks hitting the floor as you step, a police siren, \u201cbrunch at a farm-to-table restaurant in a quaint neighborhood in Brooklyn,\u201d and Wilson\u2019s podcast Metaphysical Milkshake. You know, white noise. The tiny sketch packs in jokes and promotion for the guest before you know it.\n\nThe bulk of the show focused on celebrity guest and Wilson\u2019s fellow Office alum Mindy Kaling. While they did chat (more on that later), Singh had also prepared some little bits that weren\u2019t unlike a YouTube-video premise. First, they recreated Euphoria eye-makeup looks because Kaling is a fan. And later, they played \u201cWhat\u2019s the Word?\u201d where Kaling had to guess internet slang. (That\u2019s absolutely a YouTube-video hole I\u2019ve gotten lost in before.) The bits are familiar to younger viewers, but they\u2019re based within the context of the conversation and not too wild so older viewers can get a kick out of them, too.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a talk show without an interview component, right? Despite switching up the late-night routine, A Little Late stays rooted in the basics. She still sits behind a desk; it\u2019s just modern and cool as opposed to \u2026 brown. We learn more about Mindy Kaling\u2019s new Netflix show and the fact that she would love to see Michael Scott dab if The Office were still on the air. All the fun fan service you know and love, now served with diversity and inclusion. Just like any TV show, it\u2019s going to take a few episodes for Singh to get into the swing of things, but A Little Late is already a colorful addition to the late-night lineup.", "description": "What will YouTuber Lilly Singh\u2019s late-night TV show be like?
