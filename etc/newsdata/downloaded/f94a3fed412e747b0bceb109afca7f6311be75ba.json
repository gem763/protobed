Everything you need to know about the new wireless revolution It's a capital improvement project the size of the entire planet, replacing one wireless architecture created this century with another one that aims to lower energy consumption and maintenance costs.

Billions of sensors and devices will be sprinkled all over the world enabling new applications and services,\" Huang said. \"We're working with Red Hat to build a cloud-native, massively scalable, high-performance GPU computing infrastructure for this new 5G world.\n\n\"Powered by the Nvidia EGX Edge Supercomputing Platform, a new wave of applications will emerge, just as with the smartphone revolution.\"\n\nNvidia and Microsoft have meanwhile announced a closer integration between Microsoft Azure and the Nvidia EGX platform, with the companies on Monday revealing that they are working together to advance edge-to-cloud AI computing capabilities.\n\n\"In order to use all of this sensory information \u2026 we're going to have to do this AI at the edge,\" Huang said during his keynote.\n\nThe companies will focus on intelligent edge computing, with the aim of helping industries better manage and gain insights from the data created by retail stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities, connected buildings, and urban infrastructure, as some examples.\n\n\"The age of intelligent edge computing has arrived. The world's largest industries want to have AI computing at the edge, to extract insight from continuous streams of data, and to sense, reason and act at the point of action,\" Huang said.\n\n\"In time, this will be the largest-scale computing ever created, connecting trillions of smart sensors. Nvidia's and Microsoft's platforms dovetail to offer customers an end-to-end solution from edge to cloud.\"\n\n\"Together with Nvidia, we're bringing the power of Azure and Azure AI to the edge, enabling breakthrough experiences for our customers,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"In a world where computing is becoming embedded in every place and every thing, organisations require a distributed computing fabric that spans the cloud and edge.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "It will work on 5G radio with Ericsson, cloud-native telco infrastructure with Red Hat, and focus on cloud to the edge with Microsoft.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/df3d9234-a77a-4091-bd4d-59b3b23c2d41/thumbnail/770x578/b2ddfbe0065e6e6deb9da2a9fe8e7273/istock-10287100281.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
