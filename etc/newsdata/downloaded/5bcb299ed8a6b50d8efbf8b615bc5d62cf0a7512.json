That was the case with Darnold, and concern over his spleen is what kept the second-year quarterback out last weekend after the club hoped in the lead-up to the game he would be able to play.\n\nNFL Network's Tom Pelissero said during Friday's \"NFL Now\" show that Darnold will wear specialized pads made by the same company that designed Cam Newton's flak jacket in 2015 after he sustained a rib injury the prior season.\n\n\"Standard shoulder pads really don't provide that type of protection,\" Pelissero said of Darnold's need to protect his spleen. \"Darnold went through multiple fittings. He's got something that he's comfortable with as he gets back on the field.\"\n\nLast week, Darnold said he would wear specialized padding for the entirety of the season.\n\nThe Jets are 0-4 this season, starting Darnold, Trevor Siemian (lost for season with ankle injury) and Luke Falk behind an offensive line that has surrendered 23 sacks this season. That's the most in the NFL despite the Jets already having their bye.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "When New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold returns game action this weekend,  he reportedly will have extra protection beyond what his offensive line ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
