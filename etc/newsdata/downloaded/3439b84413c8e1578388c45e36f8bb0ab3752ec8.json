They have affection for Sanders and appreciate what he\u2019s done for the movement, as roughly one dozen voters explained to me this week. But Warren, they argued, is proffering a kinder, gentler version of progressivism\u2014one that is rooted in her experience, simple to understand, and compelling enough to attract a broad swath of voters.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s everything Bernie is\u2014but a bit more electable,\u201d said Joe Piluso, a 71-year-old former Sanders supporter and former social-services worker living in San Diego.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential primary, Sanders and Warren have set their sights on combatting income inequality, and both are supported by small-dollar donors and grassroots organizing. They\u2019re closely aligned at the policy level: Both have campaigned on progressive policies such as free college, the Green New Deal, and some version of Medicare for All. But the two senators have taken very different tacks when it comes to working with the Democratic establishment. Sanders, who\u2019s always operated as an insurgent figure, still refuses to join the Democratic Party, while Warren has more closely toed the party line. Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, while Warren insists that she is \u201ccapitalist to my bones.\u201d\n\nFor many of the voters I spoke with for this story, their preference for Warren boils down to one core conclusion: She\u2019s likable. I heard the same thing in July at Netroots Nation, an annual convention for progressive activists, where the cardigan-wearing former public-school teacher was the clear 2020 favorite. \u201cI really feel like she would throw herself in front of a bus for us,\u201d one attendee told me at the time. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody who\u2019s more earnest.\u201d\n\nBarbara Helmick, the director of programs at DC Vote, an organization advocating for Washington, D.C., statehood, told me this week that she feels a connection to Warren. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of warmth and confidence and just such true passion that it really inspires me in a way that none of the other candidates do,\u201d Helmick said. Sanders, by contrast, has developed a reputation as the prickly grandfather of the progressive movement, constantly finger-wagging and shouting himself hoarse. \u201cHe\u2019s very strong and didactic and opinionated,\u201d said Linda Day, a 78-year-old retiree from Houston. But while she supported Sanders in 2016, she now views him as a \u201cpolarizing figure.\u201d\n\nVoters argued that Warren is a more skilled communicator. She \u201chas such a sharp ability to break complex policy positions into really understandable terms,\u201d Helmick said. Sanders\u2019s message isn\u2019t as accessible, Piluso echoed. And Warren\u2019s supporters view her as more of a collaborator, someone who can work with other lawmakers to accomplish progressive goals. In our conversations, many voters cited her work helping to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that Warren proposed creating in 2007, as evidence of her effectiveness. \u201cWhat I like about Warren is her plans are basically Bernie\u2019s,\u201d Day said, \u201cbut I think she\u2019s the person to get it done.\u201d As a \u201cbona fide member\u201d of the Democratic establishment, Warren is in a better position than Sanders \u201cto fundamentally shift the party\u2019s consensus on what\u2019s truly desirable and possible in terms of policy, and to get other Democrats on board with enacting real reforms,\u201d Kelly Baker, a 41-year-old writer from Memphis, Tennessee, wrote to me in an email.", "description": "The senator from Massachusetts, they argue, is proffering a gentler version of progressivism that is simple to understand and compelling enough to attract a broad swath of voters.", "authors": ["Elaine Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19212018280881_toned/facebook.jpg?1568827376", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
