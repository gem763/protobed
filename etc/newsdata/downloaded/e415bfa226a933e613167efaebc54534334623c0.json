He was held in custody there for four years before being extradited to Bosnia last year.\n\nBosnian Serbs Milan and Sredoje Lukic were sentenced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2012 to life and 27 years in prison respectively for the same crimes.\n\nBosnian Serb forces, helped by the now-defunct Serb-dominated Yugoslav People\u2019s Army (JNA) and Serbian paramilitaries, committed atrocities against Muslims in eastern Bosnia early in the conflict as part of their bid to create exclusively Serb territories.\n\nAround 100,000 people died in the war, a large majority of them Bosniaks.\n\nThe ICTY, set up to prosecute atrocities committed during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, closed its doors late in 2017, having tried 161 suspects. Lower-ranking cases have been handled by the Bosnian war crimes court.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Maja Zuvela; Editing by David Holmes)", "description": "A Bosnian court jailed a former Bosnian Serb soldier for 20 years on Wednesday for setting ablaze 57 Muslim Bosniaks, of whom 26 including a two-day-old baby died, near the eastern town of Visegrad early in Bosnia's 1992-95 war.
