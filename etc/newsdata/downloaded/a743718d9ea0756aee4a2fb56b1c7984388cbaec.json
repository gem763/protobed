The startup will now be led by Simon Sutton who comes from HBO where he served as president and chief revenue officer. Matt Sacks, a Luminary co-founder who served as CEO until now, will become the company\u2019s executive chairman.\n\nSacks called the change a \u201cperfect, positive, and transformative development for Luminary.\u201d Luminary also announced that it has raised an additional $30 million in funding.\n\nLuminary has yet to disclose listener or subscriber figures\n\nThe executive changeup comes just weeks after Luminary co-founder and chief strategy officer Joe Purzycki left the company. He was replaced with an executive from Jet.com.\n\nAfter a wave of hype for its star-studded podcast offerings, Luminary got off to a rocky start after it managed to anger many in the podcasting community. The company\u2019s business model \u2014 offering a free podcast listening app, with access to exclusive shows for $8 per month \u2014 frustrated existing podcast creators who felt their successful shows were being used to prop up someone else\u2019s business, of which they wouldn\u2019t get a cut.\n\nLuminary has continued to publish new shows from major hosts \u2014 such as celebrities Lena Dunham, Trevor Noah, and Karamo Brown \u2014 on a regular basis. But the company hasn\u2019t disclosed subscriber or listenership numbers, and its ranking in the App Store is below 200 in the entertainment category. (Most other podcast apps appear to be ranked in the news category, making it hard to compare.)\n\nThe troubled launch and potentially poor pickup of users seem to be precursors to this change coming not long into the app\u2019s life. Sutton doesn\u2019t appear to plan any major changes to Luminary just yet. In a statement, he says he thinks \u201cLuminary has the right model for the future.\u201d", "description": "The subscription podcast startup will now be led by Simon Sutton who comes from HBO where he served as president and chief revenue officer.
