I mean, what adversity did you face, exactly?\u201d\n\nJodi\u2019s adversity, if you haven\u2019t already guessed, is that she is too tall. She is a slender, six-foot-one, 16-year-old white girl who has to endure relentless refrains of, \u201cHow\u2019s the weather up there?\u201d which sounds more like a cheesy dad joke than the taunt of cruel bullies, but I digress. Her classmates allegedly call her things like \u201cLeBron\u201d or \u2018Skyscraper,\u201d though we never hear these nicknames uttered by anyone except Jodi herself in fits of self-deprecation.\n\nWhen the Tall Girl trailer dropped last month, it was immediately roasted on Twitter for, well, obvious reasons. One Twitter user shared the clip with the comment, \u201cWait are you telling me that this isn\u2019t an SNL sketch?\u201d Another tweeted, \u201cI can\u2019t believe Netflix decided tall white girls are a minority that need representation ASAP.\u201d Most of the angry reactions were from people who felt that the film was a step in the wrong direction for representation on screen. Someone else pointed to the fact that Jodi\u2019s black best friend Fareeda, played by Anjelika Washington, does not appear to get the screen time she deserves (after watching the film, I can confirm this to be the case).\n\nEssentially, Tall Girl is about Jodi Kreyman, a high school student in New Orleans who has spent her whole life ashamed of her height and is bullied for towering over her peers. Incidentally, Jodi\u2019s dad (Steve Zahn) actually seems to be the biggest bully, chatting over meals about how tall people are prone to osteoporosis and early death. In a disturbing flashback played for laughs, Zahn\u2019s character asks a physician if they can give 3-year-old Jodi hormones to stunt her growth, then, when advised that the hormones could cause infertility, turns to the toddler to ask if she even wants to have kids.\n\nJodi\u2019s older sister Harper (Sabrina Carpenter) is a beauty queen who talks incessantly about restricting her carb intake and snagging the Miss Teen Louisiana crown. Harper\u2019s great tragedy in life is that, in spite of her average height, upper-middle-class upbringing, and conventional physical beauty, she has allergies and frequently puffs on an inhaler. As Harper helplessly sneezes and surveys the bejeweled ballgowns laid out on the bed, Jodi introduces her \u201csuper-hot\u201d sister in voiceover: \u201cShe was spared the tall gene, but at least there is some balance in the genetic universe. She got Grandpa Larry\u2019s allergies.\u201d\n\nThe drama picks up when a Hemsworth-esque foreign exchange student named Stig arrives at school, capturing Jodi\u2019s attention. It is unclear if there is a plot-related reason to make Jodi\u2019s love interest, played by American actor Luke Eisner, Swedish. The best explanation I could come up with was that making Eisner do a comically bad Swedish accent was some sort of hazing ritual, or else the writers just got a kick out of hearing Jodi\u2019s name pronounced \u201cYo-di\u201d over and over.\n\nThere are too many ridiculous details from the movie to fit into this article, from the dialogue, which contains lines like, \u201cLet\u2019s face it, Jodi. You\u2019re the tall girl, you\u2019ll never be the pretty girl,\u201d to the fact that one character spends the entire film carrying around a milk crate in anticipation of the moment that he will finally get to kiss Jodi.\n\nNow, it is important to note that I am the exact target audience for these types of cringey, train-wreck Netflix original movies. Last December, I gleefully watched The Princess Switch and reveled in Vanessa Hudgens\u2019 range as she played her own twin, Lindsay Lohan-style, executing not one, but two terrible accents. As such, you can trust my opinion that Tall Girl is not bad in the can\u2019t-look-away, guilty pleasure sense; it\u2019s just regular-bad, mainly because it is boring (though I\u2019ll admit I was absolutely charmed by the aforementioned milk-crate kiss).\n\nThat said, I am not convinced that it deserves to be labeled as seriously offensive, tone-deaf, or harmful, as it was back in August. For one thing, the director, Nzingha Stewart, is a black woman whose impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes directing episodes of How to Get Away with Murder, Scandal, and Grey\u2019s Anatomy. She spoke to Black Girl Nerds about the response to the trailer. \u201cI think if something doesn\u2019t offend you outright,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cthen let it live. A movie doesn\u2019t need to be about you or for you to be of artistic value in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201c It is undeniable that no matter how teenage girls are perceived by their peers, they are often self-conscious and feel uncomfortable in their changing bodies. \u201d\n\nThere is room to argue that even if Jodi\u2019s life is not as horrible as she believes it to be\u2014even if her version of adversity pales in comparison to that experienced by countless others (and it absolutely does)\u2014the film is intended to comment more generally on the struggles with confidence and self-image everyone endures in high school. It is undeniable that no matter how teenage girls are perceived by their peers, they are often self-conscious and feel uncomfortable in their changing bodies.\n\nStewart herself explained in the interview that \u201cthe deeper pitch is that it\u2019s about how hard high school can be and how all of us feel this sort of insecurity about something.\u201d This explanation of the film would be slightly more convincing if the entire thing was not devoted to Jodi\u2019s own personal trauma. Tall Girl rarely probes beneath the surface of other characters\u2019 insecurities and at one point, Jodi even dismisses the idea that they could be as unbearable as her own, saying, \u201cYou think your life is hard? I\u2019m a high school junior wearing size 13 Nikes.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Tall Girl is simply not an important enough movie to warrant the kind of intense online backlash foreshadowed by the reactions to the trailer. If you yourself are a quote-unquote \u201ctall girl,\u201d you will probably even find some comforting solidarity in Jodi\u2019s story. Otherwise, save yourself the time and stream one of Netflix\u2019s other charming rom-com offerings, like Dumplin\u2019, To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before or Someone Great, instead.", "description": "The Netflix rom-com \u201cTall Girl\u201d is finally here.
