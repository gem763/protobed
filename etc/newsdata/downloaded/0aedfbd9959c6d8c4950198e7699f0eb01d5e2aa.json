We're doing very, very well with Turkey,\" Trump said during an unrelated event at the White House. Turkey is \"back to the full pause\" on their military operation targeting Kurdish forces in northern Syria, Trump said.\n\nThe Kurds \"are very happy about the way things are going,\" Trump added. \"We've taken control of the oil in the Middle East ... the oil that everybody was worried about.\"\n\nThe president did not explain what he meant by taking \"control of the oil in the Middle East.\" But he was likely referring to oil fields in eastern Syria, which Kurdish forces gained control over amid the chaos of Syria's civil war.\n\nThe Turkish invasion \u2013 which began last week after Trump withdrew U.S. troops from northeast Syria \u2013 jeopardized the Kurds' hold on those oil fields, as Russia, Iran and other military forces vied to fill a power vacuum left by the U.S.\n\nTrump's remarks came before a scathing new broadside on the president's Syria policy, delivered by one of his chief allies: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nTrump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has created \"a strategic nightmare for our country,\" McConnell wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Friday.\n\nEven if the U.S.-brokered cease-fire holds, McConnell said, immense damage has already been done: the U.S. campaign against the Islamic State has suffered a major setback, the Assad regime and its Iranian backers have expanded their influence in Syria, and Russia has gained new leverage in the Middle East.\n\n\"As neo-isolationism rears its head on both the left and the right, we can expect to hear more talk of 'endless wars',\" McConnell added, taking aim at one of Trump's oft-cited justifications for withdrawing U.S. forces. But \"America\u2019s wars will be 'endless' only if America refuses to win them.\"\n\nMcConnell's op-ed added new heft to the already weighty attacks on Trump's latest foreign policy move and the chaos it has unleased. It came after signs that the U.S.-Turkey deal for at temporary cease-fire \u2013 which Trump boasted would save \"millions of lives\" \u2013 might not hold.\n\nEarlier on Friday, a conflict-monitoring group and Kurdish authorities reported ongoing fighting in Syria, despite the \"cease-fire\" that Vice President Mike Pence announced on Thursday after negotiations with Erdogan in Ankara.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported fighting in villages near the northeastern Syrian city of Ras al-Ayn. The Observatory said at least five people were killed and 14 injured. The Rojava Information Center, an independent media organization staffed by volunteers, said its activists on the ground also reported advances by Turkey-backed forces on two villages near Ras al-Ayn.\n\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Kurdish forces, said on Twitter that Turkish \"air and artillery attacks\" targeting \"fighters, civilian settlements and the hospital\" in Ras al-Ayn were still taking place despite the agreement to halt military activity.\n\nTrump downplayed the reports and said Erdogan told him there had been \"minor\" clashes but they had stopped.\n\n\"Just spoke to President @RTErdogan of Turkey. He told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated,\" Trump tweeted earlier on Friday. \"He very much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work. Likewise, the Kurds want it, and the ultimate solution, to happen.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that he was not sure who was involved in Friday's clashes but suggested it could be Turkish-backed paramilitary forces.\n\n\u201cYou have irregular forces in the region,\" Pompeo told Politico in an interview Friday. \"I don\u2019t know precisely what this is, but our sense is, the political commitments that were made yesterday will end up being successful.\"", "description": "Fighting is continuing near the Syria-Turkey border despite a Trump administration boast it had helped broker\u00a0a 'cease-fire,' Kurdish authorities say.", "authors": ["Deirdre Shesgreen", "Kim Hjelmgaard", "Tom Vanden Brook", "David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FXH8N5Oxo0Rud1Y_Dz47xw--~B/aD0yMTU4O3c9MzAyNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/d7eb5aa146e86e1687776e51f7c5c4b4", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
