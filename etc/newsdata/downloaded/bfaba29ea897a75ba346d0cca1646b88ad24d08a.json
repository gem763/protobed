As well as a bunch of smaller games you\u2019ve got The Last Of Us Part II, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Watch Dogs: Legion, Doom Eternal, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Cyberpunk 2077, and Marvel\u2019s Avengers. And that\u2019s all in just the first four and a half months of the year.\n\nThat is a little more spaced out than Christmas releases though so you could make an argument that they\u2019ll all be a hit. Except maybe Watch Dogs, which is the same week as Final Fantasy. I\u2019d say the front runners are The Last Of Us and Cyberpunk 2077, with Cyberpunk presumably winning because it\u2019s multiformat.\n\nBetween Final Fantasy and The Last Of Us though Sony are going to be killing it in terms of exclusives, which is going to set them up very nicely for the next gen, especially as they still have a few things in reserve after that. All Microsoft seems to have is Ori And The Will Of The Wisps.\n\nAs for flops\u2026 I don\u2019t think Doom Eternal is going to do anything. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of an audience for it and it only seemed to do well the first time because everyone bought it cheaper. I could see Watch Dogs underperforming, especially given that release date.\n\nWagner2", "description": "The Friday Inbox asks whether Blizzard or Bethesda are having the worse year, as one reader struggles to get excited about Half-Life rumours.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot_2-b36d_1571355628.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
