He was also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and accused of improperly using insider information about impending corporate deals.\n\nCohen is the third Goldman Sachs employee to be charged in an insider trading scheme since May 2018.\n\nCohen, 33, of New York, was arraigned on Friday before a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan and released after he posted $250,000 and ordered to refrain from the \u201cconduct alleged,\u201d according to court records. A pre-trial hearing is set for Oct. 22.\n\nGoldman Sachs spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said on Saturday the firm is \u201ccooperating with the authorities on the situation regarding Mr. Cohen. Protecting client confidential information is our highest internal priority and we condemn this alleged behaviour.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe SEC complaint also names a Greek citizen, George Nikas, 54, who has homes in New York and Athens and owns a restaurant chain \u201cGRK Fresh\u201d that includes locations in Manhattan. A lawyer for Nikas could not immediately be identified Saturday.\n\nThe complaint says the pair participated in a scheme that netted Nikas at least $2.6 million in illicit profits by trading shares in two companies. Cohen passed on non-public corporate deal information to an unnamed trader who in turn gave it to Nikas who used it to illegally trade securities, the SEC said.\n\nCohen got cash in exchange for information he gave the trader.\n\nThe trader and Nikas \u201crealized millions of dollars in illicit gains from trading the securities of at least two different public companies \u2014 Syngenta AG and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc \u2014 in advance of news that these companies had been targeted for acquisition,\u201d the SEC said.\n\nThe SEC says Nikas profited from buying Syngenta securities in 2015 after first being passed information about Monsanto Co\u2019s proposal to acquire it and later about ChemChina\u2019s interest.\n\nIn October 2017, Cohen passed along that Arby\u2019s Restaurant Group was interested in acquiring Buffalo Wild Wings, the SEC said, prompting additional trades.\n\nIn June, former Goldman Sachs vice president Woojae Jung was sentenced to three months in prison for engaging in insider trading based on non-public information about several companies that were bank clients.\n\nDamilare Sonoiki, a Goldman Sachs analyst, was charged in August 2018 with leaking non-public information about pending deals to NFL football player Mychal Kendricks in exchange for cash and tickets to games. Sonoiki and Kendricks both pleaded guilty in September 2018.", "description": "A Goldman Sachs Group Inc investment banker has been released on bond and placed on leave by the firm after allegedly being involved in an insider trading scheme.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
