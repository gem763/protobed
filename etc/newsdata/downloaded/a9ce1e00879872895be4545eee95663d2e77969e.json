She's back, with a new song, Sweet Love, and a new album on the way.\n\nOne of her favourite books is The Genie in Your Genes: Epigenetic Medicine and the New Biology of Intention by Dawson Church.\n\n\"A book that I love, one that helped me heal is called The Genie in Your Genes by Dawson Church.\n\n\"I've been through a car crash that completely derailed not just my career, but my whole life \u2014 even my sense of self for a while \u2014 and my ability to function as a normal human being.\n\n\"A lot of stuff has come back since then, but the one thing that hasn't fully recovered was my ability to read a book. One of the loves of my life \u2014 reading \u2014 has become a task. I can do it, but it's not without pain. But I have definitely reflected on a lot of books while not being able to read.\n\n\"This book helped me while I was going through recovery. It's about the healing process, how people have used different techniques to heal their body through their mind. I've become passionate about different healing processes. You go to the hospital and they just give you drugs or medication that are Band-Aids. But that's not helping anything, it's hurting your liver or destroying your organs. I don't want to kill my body in the process of trying to heal my brain \u2014 because I need my body to heal my brain. So what do I do?\n\n\"I had to reflect all the books I had read before. This one came to mind a lot.\"\n\nKiesza's comments have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWatch the video for the Kiesza song Sweet Love", "description": "The singer and multi-instrumentalist shares why she loved reading The Genie in Your Genes by Dawson Church.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279340.1568219794!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kiesza-on-the-genie-in-your-genes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
