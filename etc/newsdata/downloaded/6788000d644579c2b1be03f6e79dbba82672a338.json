Its removal has sparked disapproval of Apple among Hong Kong protesters and residents.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApple in a statement obtained by the AP said the app \"has been used to target and ambush police\" and \"threaten public safety.\"\n\n\u201cCriminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\u201d Apple said. \u201cThis app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\u201d\n\nThose who have already downloaded the app still have access to it, AP reported. Protesters also use the encrypted messaging app Telegram to report police locations.\n\nProtests have ensued in Hong Kong, causing massive spats between the police and protesters, after a since-withdrawn proposal would have brought Hong Kong criminals to be extradited for trial in China.\n\nChina began pressuring Apple to get rid of the app Wednesday, days after the country became locked in a dispute with the NBA over a general manager's tweets in support of Hong Kong. China makes up Apple's second-largest market, according to the AP.\n\nThe Hill reached out to Apple for comment.", "description": "Apple\u00a0on Thursday pulled the app that tracked\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0police's location after pressure from China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/apple_phone_09122017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
