JP Morgan is predicting a sizable shift in investing. According to the firm\u2019s chief US equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, style positioning remains primed for a rotation to Value from Momentum/ Low Volatility.\n\nHe made the call last week after the market experienced one of the largest 3-day Momentum-Value rotations in over 30 years. The trigger: better than expected economic data, monetary and fiscal stimulus, easing trade tensions, and stabilization in yields. In the current rotation ~5 months of Momentum outperformance was given back in only 3 days, noted Lakos-Bujas.\n\n\u201cThe correlation between Value and Momentum is near 30-year lows, signaling extremely oversold positioning for Value\u201d he writes, adding that history suggests that Momentum sell-offs of similar magnitude are on average followed by prolonged Momentum underperformance, Value outperformance, and a flat to higher equity market.\n\nSo with this outlook in mind, which value stocks should you consider adding to your portfolio now?\n\nThe Value Portfolio\n\nHere we take a closer look at three hot stocks in the Top 10 holdings of JP Morgan\u2019s Large Cap Value Fund. To come up with these holdings, the firm analyzes company prospects for as long as five years, to gain insight into a company's real growth potential. Its goal: to identify the most undervalued securities in each sector\n\n\u201cLooks for attractive valuations as well as catalysts for stock price increases, higher potential reward versus risk, and temporary mispricing caused by market overreactions\u201d writes the firm. With this strategy in mind let\u2019s dive into three of the portfolio\u2019s key holdings.\n\n1. Marathon Petroleum Corp\n\nMarathon Petroleum (MPC\u2013 Get Report) is an independent petroleum product refiner, marketer and transporter headquartered in Ohio. It\u2019s the largest refiner in the US, with over 3 million barrels per day of capacity across 16 refineries. At the same time, MPC also is the general partner of a midstream partnership, MPLX LP (MPLX), and has a network of nearly 4,000 company-owned retail stations.\n\n\u201cWe continue to favor coastal refiners (OW-rated MPC, PSX and VLO), who have an opportunity for modestly wider coastal differentials for both light (MEH/LLS) and heavy (Maya/WCS) crudes\u201d cheered JP Morgan analyst Phil Gresh on September 10. He has just reiterated his buy rating with a $62 price target (16% upside potential). According to Gresh, MPC trades inexpensively on a sum-of-the-parts basis, \u201caround which we hope that the company will look to unlock value soon.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Street as a whole has a bullish outlook on Marathon Petroleum. The stock shows a Strong Buy consensus with a $67 average analyst price target.\n\nFor instance, RBC Capital\u2019s Brad Heffern reiterated his buy rating following the company\u2019s latest earnings results. He notes that MPC recently acquired ANDV, and achieving a $1.4 billion synergy target would be a major catalyst. \u201cIn our opinion, Marathon's retail business, Speedway, is the most attractive retail franchise in our coverage universe, and the extension of the Speedway model to the acquired ANDV stores could provide meaningful upside\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Are you ready?
