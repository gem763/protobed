Does the idea of couples from The Bachelor hosting a game night make you suddenly not hate the idea of a game night? Do you lay awake at night worrying about what the cast of Community has been up to? Yeah, us too! And that\u2019s why all of that and more is coming to Vulture Festival LA Presented by AT&T. We\u2019re bringing The Man In the High Castle to you live and in person (in a fun way, don\u2019t worry.) If you feel like getting out and about, Adam Pally and Casey Wilson will be taking a busload of us for a tour of LA\u2019s most glamorous locales, and after all that you can get a front row seat to watch David Chang do an eating demonstration. But while building out your schedule, don\u2019t forget to make time for the Party Down reunion and dinner with the One Day at a Time family. Did they invent the word \u201cFOMO\u201d to specifically describe what happens to people who miss Vulture Festival? That\u2019s impossible to know, but it\u2019s likely.\n\nGet tickets now at VultureFestival.com!\n\nTV A C o m m u n i t y R e u n i o n Attention students of Greendale, please report to Vulture Festival for a reunion of your favorite genre-redefining sitcom.\n\nWe\u2019re getting the study group \u2014 including Joel McHale, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Danny Pudi, Jim Rash, Yvette Nicole Brown, Ken Jeong, Chris McKenna, and Dan Harmon \u2014 back together to share notes on their time on the series, their favorite episodes, and if we will ever get that long-dreamed-about movie.

Chang comes to the Festival to turn it into his own personal Vulture feast, while talking about his favorite foods, the best dining experiences, and how a career in the kitchen compares to what his friends do all day.\n\nTV C o u p l e s G a m e N i g h t w i t h B a c h e l o r N a t i o n While your normie friends are home playing Scrabble with the decidedly non-famous, we\u2019ll be hanging with some of Bachelor Nation\u2019s brightest and most competitive stars.\n\nAshley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon, Jade Roper-Tolbert and Tanner Tolbert, Katie Morton and Chris Bukowski, and Cassie Randolph and Colton Underwood enjoy a night in (at Vulture Festival), playing all sorts of party, board, and dating games.\n\nTV T h e M a n i n t h e H i g h C a s t l e V i s i t s O u r R e a l i t y In this world, you\u2019re presented with the opportunity to attend Vulture Festival along with the cast and creators of Amazon Prime Video\u2019s The Man in the High Castle.\n\nJoin cast members Rufus Sewell, Jason O\u2019Mara, Chelah Horsdal, Joel de la Fuente, and Frances Turner, along with executive producers Isa Dick Hackett and David Scarpa, for a conversation about what brings this complex, nuanced tale to life and a special sneak peek at what\u2019s to come in the exciting conclusion of the series in season four.\n\nFun A S t a r T o u r W i t h A d a m P a l l y & C a s e y W i l s o n Los Angeles is a city of stars, so who better to show you around than two of our favorite celebrities, Adam Pally and Casey Wilson?\n\nJoin them on a bus tour of all the most glamorous places that also happen to be easily accessible in L.A. traffic at 4 p.m. on a Sunday.
