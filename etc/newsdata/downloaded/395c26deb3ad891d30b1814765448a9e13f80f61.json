He said renewable sources can offer up to 30% in energy savings.\n\nCost and efficiency are two of the main drivers behind the push by companies to unload a good portion of their IT systems and software to third-party data centers, he said.\n\nBy renting space in these warehouse-sized facilities, equipped with racks, servers, cooling systems and other hardware, companies only pay for the amount of power they use, on top of the terms set out in rental agreements.\n\nThat can be considerable. In the U.S. alone, companies paid for a total of 171 megawatts at facilities in the country\u2019s largest data-center rental markets, during the first six months of 2019. That is on pace for a record, according to real-estate services firm CBRE Group Inc.\n\nData-center operators in key U.S. markets have increased total power capacity by 200 megawatts this year, up about 8% from the same period last year, to keep up with rising demand, CBRE estimates.\n\nComputer infrastructure, along with the internet, is on pace to use up to 15% of all the world\u2019s electricity by 2030, emitting up to 7% of the world\u2019s energy-related carbon emissions, according to researchers at Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nThe biggest data-center landlords, such as Equinix Inc. and Digital Realty Trust Inc., typically charge rent for physical space, equipment and security services\u2014depending on the rental terms\u2014while the companies pay for the power they use, based on an agreed price negotiated with local utilities.\n\nTheir largest customers are cloud-service providers, but also include other technology firms, as well as banks, retailers and any other businesses.\n\nAbout 9,100 data centers world-wide are owned and operated by cloud service providers, data-center landlords and other technology firms, up from 7,500 last year, according to International Data Corp., which expects that number to top 10,000 by 2020.\n\nMr. Kidd said many data-center operators are simply following the lead set by big cloud-computing providers\u2014not least market front-runner Amazon.com Inc. \u2014in moving toward renewable energy.\n\nPushing local utilities to supply data-center operators with renewable sources of energy wouldn\u2019t be possible without the large cloud companies stepping in, \u201cbecause you didn\u2019t have enough draw in any one place as a consumer of power\u201d to make it worthwhile for energy suppliers, he said.\n\nAmazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant\u2019s cloud computing division, last year surpassed a goal of providing half of the power usage at its data-center facilities through renewable-energy sources, the company said.\n\nAWS also recently announced projects to build four new wind farms and one new solar farm, including two located in the U.S., two in Ireland and one in Sweden, to power data centers across these regions. Combined with nine solar and wind plants, AWS said it expects to generate more than 2.9 million megawatt hours of renewable energy a year.\n\nTo entice companies to switch to sustainable power, Iron Mountain in February launched a program to help its data-center users tally renewable-energy consumption, as a way to gauge progress on their own sustainability goals, often set by board-level mandates.\n\nMike Mattera, director of sustainability at Akamai Technologies Inc., said the program played a large part in the company\u2019s decision to rent data-center space at Iron Mountain\u2019s facility in New Jersey\u2014with operations expected to go online within the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first project where we can leverage documentation that can be used for renewable-energy credits,\u201d Mr. Mattera said. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely seeing more companies looking for those benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "Iron Mountain is stepping up efforts to sell data-center customers on solar, wind and other renewable-energy sources by touting benefits including lower electricity bills.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102626/social"}
