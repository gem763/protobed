He hit seven straight shots in the first-half run that saw the Clippers overcome their 11-point deficit to take a 62-54 lead into halftime.\n\nAnd after Green led the Lakers with an 18-point third quarter to enter the fourth quarter tied at 85, Leonard and his new teammates maintained their poise for a dominant final stanza in the 10-point win.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all Leonard. Leonard and George join a team that made the playoffs in the cutthroat Western conference without them last season and took two games off the Golden State Warriors in their first-round matchup. This is core that already knows how to win.\n\nClippers veterans shine alongside Leonard\n\nStory continues\n\nLou Williams played his regular spark-plug role off the bench, notching 21 points and seven assists while Montrezl Harrell racked up 17 points and seven rebounds. It was a strong team defensive effort that saw the Clippers hold the Lakers to 43.5 percent shooting from the field and force 15 turnovers.\n\n\u201cYou see what they did last year,\u201d Leonard told TNT\u2019s Allie LaForce of his Clippers teammates. \u201cThese guys fight. They fight hard every single night.\u201d\n\nLeBron James, Anthony Davis side by side\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad for Lakers fans as they got their first glimpse of James and Davis playing together. James tallied 18 points, nine rebounds and eight assists to kick off his 17th NBA season. He was dominant at times on defense, forcing multiple turnovers including a third-quarter sequence that saw him secure a chase-down block of Landry Shamet and draw a charge from Harrell on the same possession.\n\nThat is just an incredible defensive possession by LeBron James. Wow. pic.twitter.com/DraLcbY49w \u2014 Dime (@DimeUPROXX) October 23, 2019\n\nDavis tallied 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and two blocks in his Lakers debut while leading the team in field goal attempts with 21, a statistic that could be the norm his season in Los Angeles.\n\nBut neither was efficient against the Clippers defense, as Davis hit 8-of-21 field goal attempts and James connected on 7-of-19. They combined for two points in the decisive fourth quarter.\n\nThe Lakers played without Kyle Kuzma, who\u2019s nursing a stress injury in his foot.\n\nDanny Green\u2019s record night\n\nGreen looked every bit the shooter the Lakers so often lacked last season, heating up to hit 7-of-9 3-point attempts en route to his team-leading 28 points, breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s record of 27 points in a Lakers debut.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough as Leonard picked up where he left off as the Finals MVP in Toronto.\n\nBoth teams will be considerably more seasoned the next time they tip off on Christmas day. If all goes as planned, George and Kuzma will take the floor for Round 2\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Clippers overcame an injured Paul George and a record night from Danny Green to win the opening salvo in the battle of Los Angeles.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.uXakMxmatUjaTYwI36cPw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MTMuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TH25NqacZKUy0aMkXcwHfw--~B/aD0zMTY4O3c9NDQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6826a530-f551-11e9-bcbe-03de30a8bb95", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
