Mr Johnson\u2019s has two.\n\nIf Mr Johnson fought a General Election now he would campaign on the false choice of the People versus Parliament.\n\nThanks to MPs voting against him it would now be all but impossible to hold that election until next year.\n\nWhich gives us all a break.\n\nPunished twice\n\nThe country is becoming more aware of sexual abuse. And worse at tackling it.\n\nToday we reveal how hundreds of child victims are denied compensation because they have committed crimes.\n\nYet it is often the abuse they suffered which led them to subsequently break the law.\n\nAnd rape victims are now having to wait six months longer for justice than they did 10 years ago.\n\nThis is often because police have to wade through so much more social media and electronic material.\n\nIt is also because there are too few police officers to deal with sensitive investigations.\n\nNeither children nor adults should suffer in this way for something not their fault.\n\nThat is punishing them twice for the crimes committed by others.\n\nStamp it out\n\nRacism doesn\u2019t just happen on Bulgarian football terraces.\n\nWe need to deal with racism here at home, too. EastEnders star Zack Morris encountered it in a car park when he was called n***** and Uncle Tom.\n\nAnd Haringey Borough boss Tom Loizou had to lead his team off the pitch yesterday after his goalie was abused.\n\nSuch behaviour shames us all. And we must stamp on it wherever it is found.", "description": "The Brexit decision MPs are being asked to take will affect generations to come and should not be made lightly", "authors": ["Voice Of The Mirror", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656242.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
