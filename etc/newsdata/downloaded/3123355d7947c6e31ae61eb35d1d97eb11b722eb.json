Quick, get the first aid kit out.\n\nThis is one of the important, and slightly creepy, lessons we learned from one candidate as the 15th series kicked off on BBC1 on Wednesday.\n\nThese arrogant and \u00adnonsensical quotes as we meet the prize idiots \u2013 sorry, I mean entrepreneurs \u2013 are the best part of the show, which is business contest meets comedy spoof.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen hell until you\u2019ve seen me mad!\u201d squeaked one, who Lord Sugar noted was \u201cas scary as an indoor firework\u201d.\n\nElsewhere, Shahin calls himself The Falcon and thought that he and Shugs could call their company Shamstrad.\n\nAmong the \u00adhopefuls, a librarian, a \u00adpillow salesman and an artisan baker. Or in more accurate descriptions: chancers, posers, brown nosers, bullsh**ers and schmoozers.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\n\nFunnily enough, all the people Lord Sugar doesn\u2019t like.\n\nAnd yet, he will invest \u00a3250,000 into one of their businesses. I wouldn\u2019t trust any of them with my five-year-old\u2019s piggy bank.\n\nThings got off to a dramatic start with the 16 suited-up egos told they were straight off to Cape Town in South Africa.\n\nThey had to set up, sell and run a guided tour, giving clients an unforgettable \u00adexperience or their money back. Unforgettable is right.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cOw can we lose?\u201d said gorblimey \u00adgeezer Thomas. \u201cGet there, smash it, go and have a nice bit of dinner.\u201d\n\nThis is a clue that someone is on a fast track to a mug of tea in the caff.\n\nThe boys\u2019 team didn\u2019t sell all of their tickets to their brilliant safari tour, which would \u00addefinitely feature the Big Five African animals.\n\nBecause we all know how easy it is to guarantee the scheduled arrival time of a wild elephant. Meanwhile, the girls were taking part in a Benny Hill sketch to find the wine cellar, while Lottie kept banging on about working in the UK\u2019s best wine bar. No wonder the others got sour grapes.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe girls\u2019 team won in the end, by a tiny margin, and skipped off to drink \u00adchampagne in their luxury home while the boys entered into some \u201cunprofessional squabbling\u201d as Sugar put it.\n\nFinally, Shaheen and his Shamstrad dreams departed in the black cab of shame.\n\nLong in the tooth it may be but it\u2019s a formula I love. From the wheelie suitcases and early morning wake-up calls with pants and bed hair, to the East End \u00adcomedy sideshow from Sugar and \u00adwithering \u00adput-downs from Claude Littner and Karren Brady.\n\nBring on the cringe-worthy pitches, childish bickering and Lord Sugar saying \u201cshambles\u201d a lot. As long as he\u2019s happy to part with his cash, I\u2019ll be tuning in.", "description": "Among the \u00adhopefuls, a librarian, a \u00adpillow salesman and an artisan baker.
