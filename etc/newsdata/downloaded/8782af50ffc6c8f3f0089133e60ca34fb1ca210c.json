(Family photo)\n\nShuping Wang, a medical researcher who defied Chinese authorities in the early 1990s by exposing the burgeoning HIV epidemic in one of her country\u2019s poorest provinces, where an estimated 1 million destitute farmers sold their blood plasma at collection sites and were infected with the deadly disease, died Sept. 21. She was 59.\n\nShe was hiking in a canyon in Salt Lake City when she suffered an apparent heart attack, said her husband, Gary Christensen.\n\nDr. Wang had lived for the past 18 years in the United States, becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, but continued to contend with the intimidation by Chinese government officials that had helped drive her from her home.\n\nAs recently as last month, she had said, Chinese police called on her friends and colleagues in Zhoukou, the city in Henan province that was the site of much of her whistleblowing work, in an effort to pressure Dr. Wang to halt a play about her story on stage at the Hampstead Theatre in London.\n\n\u201cThe only thing harder than standing up to the Communists and their security police is not giving in to pressure from friends and relatives who are threatened with their livelihoods all because you are speaking out,\u201d she said in a statement on Sept. 3. \u201cBut even after all this time, I will still not be silenced.\u201d\n\nAmong AIDS activists and others who followed her work, Dr. Wang was regarded as a heroine who risked her career and safety to expose the rampant spread of hepatitis C and HIV among poor villagers recruited by the government to sell their blood plasma for medical purposes.\n\n\u201cExtend your arm. Expose a vein. Make a fist. And it\u2019s 50 yuan,\u201d or approximately $7.50, went one slogan. For Henan farmers, that sum represented a considerable windfall.\n\nChinese officials had embarked on the collection campaign in an effort to keep HIV, which they regarded as a foreigner\u2019s disease, out of the Chinese blood supply. Instead of relying on foreign blood products as HIV/AIDS spread across the United States and other countries, China would harvest its own.\n\nBut, as Dr. Wang began to discern in the early 1990s, poor collection practices \u2014 as well as government efforts to cover up their consequences \u2014 fueled the wild spread of the disease. Among other unsafe methods, blood was drawn from multiple donors and combined. After the plasma was extracted, the remaining mixed blood was reinjected into the donors. If any one donor had HIV, all the others might contract it.\n\nA specialist in hepatitis, Dr. Wang was assigned to a plasma collection station in Zhoukou in 1991. After confirming her suspicions that many donors there were infected with hepatitis C, she implored officials at the site to change the collection prac\u00adtices.\n\n\u201cThis will increase cost,\u201d she said she was told.\n\nUndeterred, Dr. Wang took her concerns to the Ministry of Health in Beijing, which began requiring hepatitis C screening for blood plasma donors in 1993, she wrote in an account of her work published on the website China Change in 2012. Officials at the collection site had her removed, but she continued inspecting facilities elsewhere in the region and found similar cross-contamination.\n\n\u201cMy own investigation found hepatitis C antibody positive rate to be as high as 84.3%. Being a doctor, I was very anxious,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI knew that hepatitis C and HIV had the same routes of infection. . . . I didn\u2019t want to sit in the office of the Health Bureau waiting for the arrival of an AIDS epidemic. I wanted to directly monitor it and prevent it.\u201d\n\nShe was joined in her efforts by Gao Yaojie, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Henan province, also later exiled to the United States, who became one of the country\u2019s most prominent AIDS activists.\n\n\u201cTogether the two women started a campaign \u2014 Wang behind the scenes with facts and information and Gao out front with a steely resolve and charisma \u2014 that shook China\u2019s faith in its health system and government,\u201d Kathleen McLaughlin, a journalist who covered the scandal, wrote in an account published in the London Guardian last year.\n\nUsing her own money, Dr. Wang began testing blood samples for HIV and found an infection rate of 13 percent. After she took the samples to Beijing, she found herself frozen out by local and provincial health leaders, who stood to be embarrassed by her revelations. A man she described as a \u201cretired leader of the Health Bureau\u201d came to her testing site and smashed her sign with a baton. When she tried to stop him from destroying her equipment, he struck her.\n\nIn 1996, the collection sites were shut down and reopened with HIV testing for donors. \u201cI felt very gratified,\u201d Dr. Wang wrote, \u201cbecause my work helped to protect the poor.\u201d But she continued to face intimidation. Her clinical testing center was ultimately closed and the utilities cut off, resulting in the loss of all the samples she had collected.\n\nShe found work in Beijing before coming to the United States in 2001, the same year that a senior Chinese government official conceded for the first time that the country had a \u201cvery serious epidemic of H.I.V.-AIDS\u201d and that coverup efforts by local officials had contributed to its spread. In an interview after Dr. Wang\u2019s death, Wan Yanhai, a prominent Chinese AIDS activist also exiled to the United States, commended her as a health scientist who \u201ctook responsibility . . . to tell the truth.\u201d\n\nZou Shuping was born Oct. 20, 1959, in Fugou County, Henan province. Her mother was a village physician, and her father was a math teacher.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Dr. Wang recalled watching her parents be forced to put on dunce caps because her father had been a soldier in the nationalist Kuomintang forces.\n\nShe was expelled from school at 8 and was readmitted only after she was adopted by an uncle, who belonged to the Communist Party, and adopted his surname, Wang. She resumed her studies, ultimately earning a medical degree and a PhD, her family said.\n\nHer first marriage, in China to Honghai Geng, ended in divorce amid her whistleblowing campaign. In the United States, she married Christensen in 2005. Besides her husband, of Salt Lake City, survivors include a daughter from her first marriage, Samantha Geng of Tucson; two children from her second marriage, Julie Zou of Bethesda, Md., and David Zou of Salt Lake City; and a brother.\n\nAfter Dr. Wang\u2019s death, David Cowhig, a retired U.S. Foreign Service officer assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing from 1996 to 2001, wrote on his blog, \u201cNow it can be told: Shuping Wang . . . was also the single most important source\u201d for U.S. officials seeking to understand and curb the HIV epidemic in China.\n\n\u201cShe provided rock-solid, highly sensitive internal information about the HIV epidemic and the Chinese leadership\u2019s disappointingly weak response,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat in turn seized the attention of the Clinton White House.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, Dr. Wang did medical research in Milwaukee and later at the University of Utah.\n\n\u201cI have since been working over 10 hours every day,\u201d she wrote in her 2012 account of her life. \u201cHard as it is, I have learned a lot of new technologies and techniques. I am still hoping that, one day, I will be able to apply my experience and skills to serve the Chinese people.\u201d", "description": "She helped reveal contamination at blood plasma collection sites where an estimated 1 million farmers were infected with the deadly disease.", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YvzfqqK8CTua_qN8oHAsNn0oobE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MFWCH5W7ZII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
