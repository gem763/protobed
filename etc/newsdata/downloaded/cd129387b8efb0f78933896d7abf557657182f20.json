With his party controlling the Senate, and Republican base voters still strongly supporting him, Trump appears to be insulated against removal from office.\n\nThis is a reminder that political realities are as important as any other factor, if not more so, in the decision to remove a president charged with \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d While many argue that this is a perversion of the Founders\u2019 vision, they themselves were unsure about the effectiveness of impeachment and removal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, the Founders\u2019 debates over impeachment offer another solution to handling Trump: voters, rather than the Congress, can choose to remove him from office next year. And if the success rate of prior impeachment efforts is any guide, the House ought to leave the president\u2019s fate to the voters in 2020.\n\nFrom the outset, there were no easy answers to the impeachment question. Some thought the whole thing unnecessary. At the constitutional convention, the New York lawyer and merchant Gouverneur Morris initially argued that the executive should \u201cnot be impeachable\u201d and instead suggested a \u201cbiennial election\u201d every two years. Rufus King of New York concurred, arguing that the president would \u201cperiodically be tried for his behaviour by his electors,\u201d namely through a regular election cycle.\n\nThe majority of the delegates, however, disagreed with King and Morris, believing that elections alone were insufficient to check presidential misdeeds. They especially worried about the very real possibility of bribes from foreign governments, as had been the case throughout English history. Concerned about this possibility, Morris started to believe that the impeachment clause was a necessary evil. But reflecting upon the overthrow of the monarchy during the American Revolution, he wisely concluded: \u201cThe people are the King.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven after the delegates agreed on having an impeachment procedure, they continued to debate how the process for removal would work. In September, as the convention waned, a draft called for the Senate to serve as the deliberative body.\n\nUndeterred, James Madison made a case for the Supreme Court assuming this role instead. To Madison, the president would become \u201cimproperly dependent\u201d upon the Senate, which might hold the possibility of removal over his head to extract concessions. But much had changed in the months between the two debates. None other than Morris came to the defense of the proposed removal method, arguing that \u201cno other tribunal than the Senate could be trusted\u201d and noting that there \u201ccould be no danger that the Senate would say untruly on their oaths.\u201d That the president also held the authority to appoint judges to the Supreme Court ultimately swayed the delegates to lodge the removal power in the Senate.\n\nThe final compromise found senators acting as jurors and the chief justice of the United States as judge. To remove, the Constitution required the high bar of a two-thirds guilty vote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet the inclusion of this extra safeguard did not erase concern about the potential abuse of executive power, and those favoring ratification of the Constitution had to explain why impeachment was an adequate check on the executive. In Federalist No. 66, Alexander Hamilton argued that impeachment fit within the system of checks and balances. He espoused the virtues of a \u201cpartial intermixture\u201d between the House and the Senate in the impeachment process, which acted as \u201can essential check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive.\u201d Americans need not worry, Hamilton assured, the Constitution was a balanced document.\n\nIn reality, the system of checks and balances played out in an America starkly different from the one envisioned by the Founders. The factional differences so bemoaned by Madison in Federalist No. 10 worsened during the 19th century. By the late 1820s, political parties became an entrenched feature of American politics, warping debates in part thanks to each side wielding its own media megaphone through print newspapers.\n\nThe result was partisan disagreements splashed across front pages, including during the first case of presidential impeachment in 1868. As early as 1866, radical Republican newspapers called on Congress to impeach President Johnson. When Congress finally did so in 1868, northern and southern newspapers offered different interpretations about the realities of the situation, echoing the divisions that riddled the nation before the Civil War. The radical northern press prevailed, with their views becoming mainstream (perhaps unsurprising given that the Republicans controlled Congress).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the next century, technology dramatically changed the media. But simultaneously, the partisan press of the 19th century gave way to a norm of objectivity. So it was that Americans experienced the debate over the fate of Richard Nixon in 1974 in real time, but with relatively neutral media coverage. This environment helped explain why the impeachment process prompted Nixon\u2019s resignation.\n\nEven so, the markers of partisanship were present and, to a great extent, Nixon exited office only because of the White House taping system, which vividly exposed his crimes. While it was a far less partisan time than today, Senate Republicans largely remained supportive of Nixon \u2014 which made him immune from removal even with 61 Democratic senators \u2014 until the release of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape changed the political calculus. Two days later, Republican Senators Barry Goldwater and Hugh Scott met with the president to inform him that party\u2019s support had evaporated. Nixon announced his resignation the next day.\n\nRather than being an example of how well the impeachment process worked, Nixon\u2019s situation showed just how hard it was for partisans to abandon an ethically challenged president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt only became harder thanks to changes in the media and intensifying partisanship in the late 20th century. The launch of CNN in 1980 led to a 24/7 news cycle, and the rise of first conservative talk radio in the late 1980s and then Fox News, which launched in 1996, paved the way for new partisan media.\n\nBy the time of Clinton\u2019s impeachment, Americans experienced the proceedings through saturation coverage, which precipitated deep divisions and a partisan slugfest.\n\nIn the Republican-controlled House, the 1998 vote fell with few exceptions along strict party lines. In the Senate trial, not a single Democrat voted in favor of removal, which effectively doomed the effort.\n\nAD\n\nSince the Clinton impeachment, partisanship has only intensified further, in part because ideological media has proliferated, placing increasing pressure upon politicians to hew to the party line and fueling very different understandings of even the biggest political happenings.\n\nAD\n\nThe prospect of securing 67 votes to remove Trump or any subsequent president from office has become almost unthinkable. And the last time that one party came close to having a two-thirds majority in the Senate was in 1965. Perhaps Madison was not wrong in questioning whether the Senate was the best forum to decide upon removal of a president, though the increasingly partisan nature of the Supreme Court casts doubt on the neutrality of that body as well.\n\nThe America the Founders envisioned, one without media-fueled partisanship, may have made impeachment a more usable tool to contain abuses of executive power. But it did not develop, and now removing a president via this cumbersome process is virtually impossible, absent the sort of irrefutable smoking gun that felled Nixon. Even that might not be sufficient today thanks to the rise of ideological broadcast media that leaves Americans willing to disbelieve anything.\n\nAD\n\nIn the end, it turns out that Gouverneur Morris\u2019s original idea might\u2019ve been right after all: the best, and perhaps only, remedy for presidential misconduct is \u201cperiodical elections.\u201d Rather than impeaching Trump, the House would be wise to listen to this long ago Founder: The people have an opportunity to render judgment on President Trump\u2019s misdeeds, and removing him from office in 2020 won\u2019t require a two-thirds majority.\n\nAD", "description": "The Founders also created an alternative for holding an out of control executive accountable.", "authors": ["Thomas Balcerski", "Thomas Balcerski Teaches History At Eastern Connecticut State University", "Is Author Of"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WcZyRTtv0NdMEP6Hry_qY1D5HtY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2IWK4UHDX4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
