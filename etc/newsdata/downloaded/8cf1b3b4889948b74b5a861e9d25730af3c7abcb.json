We don\u2019t want one king to rule it all and have a kind of monopoly.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe should really look into continuing to support auteur film-makers at every level.\u201d\n\nScorsese triggered the row with a magazine interview in which he described Marvel films as \u201cnot cinema\u201d and likened them to \u201ctheme parks\u201d instead. He was swiftly backed up by Coppola, who called superhero films \u201cdespicable\u201d. Other auteurs have also voiced criticism: Ken Loach said the films are \u201cboring\u201d and \u201ca cynical exercise [that] has nothing to do with the art of cinema\u201d, while Pedro Almod\u00f3var expressed disdain for their sexlessness.\n\nDirectors including James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Joss Whedon (The Avengers) have defended the genre, with Gunn writing on social media: \u201cSuperheroes are simply today\u2019s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers.\u201d Robert Iger, chairman and CEO of Disney (which owns Marvel), also defended its franchises, saying \u201cI don\u2019t get what [Coppola and Scorsese are] criticising us for when we\u2019re making films that people are obviously enjoying going to and they\u2019re doing so by the millions.\u201d\n\nAuteurs assemble! What caused the superhero backlash?
