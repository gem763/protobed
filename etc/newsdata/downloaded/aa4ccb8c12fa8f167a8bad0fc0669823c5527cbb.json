But we're assured the Asia Society's gala has managed to entice a number of high-profile guests, including new UN ambassador Mitch Fifield and ABC managing director David Anderson.", "description": "A scheduling dilemma as two big foreign institutions throw competing bashes on Thursday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1595%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_700%2C$y_409/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7eb297e92e5094ac28794504609e8689da227c6c", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
