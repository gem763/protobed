The Portage, Mich.\u2013based advisor\u2014Barron\u2019s second-ranked independent advisor nationally\u2014lays out the reasons why he\u2019s sitting out the M&A frenzy, explains why he\u2019s bullish on stocks, and offers President Donald Trump some advice on negotiating with his native country.\n\nQ: Where did you grow up, and how did you get into the industry?\n\nA: I was born in Shanghai, China, and came over for school. I finished my graduate degree in economics from Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo in June 1991, and I started studying to become a financial advisor that summer at age 23 or 24. [I earned] a Series 7, a Series 63, and an insurance license as well.\n\nMy wife was in graduate school at the time at Western Michigan University, and we didn\u2019t want to separate. So [I started my career in Kalamazoo] as opposed to going to Chicago, Los Angeles, or some big city with a large population of people who speak Chinese. I was appointed to be a financial advisor with American Express Financial Advisors, at the time called IDS Financial.\n\nQ: Having come from Shanghai to the U.S., you probably did not have a large social network. How did you get your first clients?\n\nA: You\u2019re definitely right, I had no natural market whatsoever. One of my few initial clients was my economics professor. Luckily he thought I was a very good student, and he trusted me.\n\nI also did a lot of cold calls. It was hard, I have to admit. [At American Express] we had cold leads and warm leads. Cold leads are basically from the phone book. And warm leads are people who\u2019ve requested some information. So they sold [the warm leads] to us, $7.50 per lead. So I bought the maximum number of leads, 50 or 100 a month.\n\nEven for people that were born here, I think [cold calling] is very hard. The key is persistence. It\u2019s a numbers game; don\u2019t take it personally. Of course I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t have to make cold calls anymore.\n\nI think my story is very close to The Pursuit of Happyness, with Will Smith, about a homeless guy who got a job with Dean Witter. I was not homeless, but I can tell you, I definitely maximized my credit-card debts. American Express at the time started people at an $18,000 salary, and you have to pay your own expenses. So you\u2019re starting with almost nothing, and you maximize your credit-card debt and build up your business.\n\nFive years later I became the No. 1 advisor at American Express. You can always find a reason why you\u2019re successful or an excuse why you fail, I guess.\n\nQ: What was the biggest impediment in transitioning from a small practice to a larger one?\n\nA: Even when I was No. 1 at American Express, it was still a very small team. In 1996 I had, believe it or not, two staff with me\u2014that\u2019s it. Right now there are almost 40 of us. That\u2019s totally different. I think the main challenge with scale is management skill: how to manage people, how to work together as a team.\n\nEventually I went back to school part-time in the executive M.B.A. [program] at Northwestern Kellog School of Management and got my M.B.A. in 2004. That helped me a lot. My wife [chief operating officer Lynn Chen-Zhang] is a CPA; she quit her job as a manager with a Fortune 500 company in 1998 and joined me. She definitely has management skills and has made my practice much better.\n\nQ: What is your biggest business challenge right now?\n\nA: Keeping a focus, making sure your business is effective, making sure you\u2019re client-centric, and keeping costs low for clients. All those things are a challenge. I guess it\u2019s a combination of everything, and we just have to deal with it on a daily basis.\n\nQ: There\u2019s a lot of M&A going on in the industry. Are you interested in being a seller or buyer?\n\nA: I have no interest in acquiring another firm because I like organic growth. Culture-wise, I like just growing in my own way. I have no interest in selling the business either. People approach me very seriously probably every month or every other month, from PE firms to large firms...right now we ignore it.\n\nEveryone has different motivations; my motivation right now is to see this firm continue doing well for our clients, and eventually pass it to my children. Both of my kids probably will want to be involved in this business, and eventually we\u2019d like to have a partner from our staff.\n\nAlso, as far as being acquired by another firm, my thing is, I don\u2019t see any truly fee-only firms. I\u2019m talking about a Napfa [National Association of Personal Financial Advisors], fee-only standard of firm. For fee-only, we\u2019re truly the largest. I\u2019d like to keep that the way it is. I hope that we will continue doing well for our clients, and for our community too. We take 20% to 30% of our total revenue and give it back to our community.\n\nQ: Who are your clients?\n\nA: Typically retirees or pre-retirees, whose assets are roughly $2 million, and net worth a little over $3 million. They are professionals\u2014physicians, doctors, dentists, corporate executives, or small- to mid-size-business owners.\n\nQ: What are their main concerns these days?\n\nA: A lot of things, but especially the political uncertainty and trade war. They\u2019re worried that we [might] have another recession coming, and are concerned about what happens next.\n\nQ: As a native of China, what is your perspective on the trade war, and the probability of a successful outcome for the U.S.?\n\nA: We believe the U.S. and China can come to terms on most [of their] disagreements. But the issue of forced technology transfers will be very difficult to resolve. Given the U.S. presidential election cycle, we believe China has some incentive to prolong negotiations. In China it\u2019s autocracy, not democracy. They don\u2019t have to face the votes. They can play a tough game. As a result, we believe the best investors can hope for is a trade agreement that does not effectively resolve the technology transfer issues.\n\nWith China\u2019s government, one thing that\u2019s very important is that you don\u2019t want them to lose face. The advice I\u2019d give President Trump is, you\u2019ll probably get a good deal, but let them keep face. You [should] not always say, \u201cI\u2019m winning, I\u2019m winning.\u201d\n\nQ: What\u2019s your outlook for the markets?\n\nA: We believe that equity markets reflect a stable, growing economy. If you take a look at the S&P 500, the 12-month forward [price/earnings] number is 16.8 times, close to the 25 year-average of 16.2. Therefore we believe if the U.S. and China can resolve the trade war, we would expect modest gains in the equity markets over the next six months.\n\nQ: What investments have you been rotating into lately?\n\nA: We added gold last year, and some of the gold positions made a pretty good return this year. And I do believe that in the next five years emerging markets will do well, especially emerging market value funds.\n\nAnother area is U.S. value stocks. I do believe it will do better than growth for the next five or 10 years. I also believe small-caps will do better than large-caps.\n\nInternationally, we still believe emerging markets represent the strongest growth potential. [They] are very reasonably priced, trading at a forward-12-months earnings multiple of 12. Emerging markets GDP growth of 4% in 2019 is nearly double that of developed markets.\n\nQ: Do you use funds and ETFs exclusively, or do you also pick stocks?\n\nA: We don\u2019t do too much with individual securities because we just don\u2019t believe in stock picking. We use a majority of DFA and Vanguard funds. And some ETFs\u2014they are for limit orders just in case the market crashes like in December last year, which worked out great for us.\n\nQ: How often to do you use limit orders?\n\nA: Almost every client\u2019s portfolio has limit orders.\n\nQ: You\u2019re very picky about who you accept as a client. Why?\n\nA: I believe that quality is more important than quantity\u2014and the quality of a client is not just about assets. So we normally take on less than 100 clients a year.\n\nWe like clients who have a certain amount of money\u2014$1 million and above\u2014[but] are reasonable and smart. Our clients believe in long-term investing and the financial-planning process.\n\nI don\u2019t want people who say, \u201cCharles, because you\u2019re a top-ranked advisor, I expect to make a 15%, 20% return without risk.\u201d I tell people that doesn\u2019t exist. When you overpromise, you can easily get a client, but you also get a very upset client down the road because you cannot keep your promise. Our clients believe risk and reward are associated.\n\nQ: The industry is under pricing pressure. How is Zhang Financial responding?\n\nA: People expect that if you\u2019re a top financial advisor you should charge more, but we are actually below-average price, [including] our fee plus internal costs. It normally totals around 1%, or hopefully even lower than that.\n\n[Our fee] includes comprehensive financial planning, asset management, and all trading costs, including rebalancing and limit orders to enhance return. We include comprehensive tax planning\u2014we have six CPAs at our firm. Social Security maximization. Estate planning.\n\nWe can\u2019t compete with someone like an online service; that\u2019s different. But there\u2019s no way online services will be personalized the way we\u2019re doing.\n\nQ: Why would the total paid by the client be 1% in some cases and less in others?\n\nA: Our flat advisory fee is based on assets under management. On average, our internal mutual fund expense ratio averages near 12 to 14 basis points. The variation in price comes from different client portfolio sizes. For example, larger client portfolios are charged 50 basis points for an advisory fee, plus the mutual fund expense ratio cost, yielding a total all-in cost of 62 to 64 basis points. Smaller client portfolios may be charged with an advisory fee of 85 to 90 basis points, so after internal costs, their total cost will end up at almost exactly 1%.\n\nI always tell my staff to think about this: If it were your money, would you choose Zhang Financial as your financial advisor? Advisors cannot charge people 2% or 1\u00bd% and take [client loyalty] for granted. Not anymore.\n\nQ: Thanks, Charles.", "description": "Barron\u2019s second-ranked independent advisor on why he\u2019s sitting out the M&A frenzy, why he\u2019s bullish on stocks, and how President Trump should negotiate with China.", "authors": ["Steve Garmhausen"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-118325/social", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
