I'm Rebecca Kheel, and here's your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter.\n\nTHE TOPLINE: Washington reacted Monday to the news that a U.S. military raid ended in the death of the world's most wanted terrorist, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nPresident Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE announced Sunday that a raid in the northwest Syrian town of Barisha ended after U.S. troops chased al-Baghdadi into a tunnel where he exploded his suicide vest, killing himself and three children.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,\" Trump said Sunday, claiming that Baghdadi died \"whimpering.\"\n\nTrump may release video: Trump said Monday he is considering releasing portions of the video of the U.S. military raid that led to al-Baghdadi's death.\n\n\"We're thinking about it. We may,\" Trump told reporters Monday when asked about the prospect of releasing the footage at Andrews Air Force Base. \"We may take certain parts of it and release it, yes.\"\n\nTrump described the raid in northwest Syria in great detail when announcing al-Baghdadi's death in an address on Sunday morning. Trump said he watched much of the raid in the Situation Room, likening it to \"watching a movie.\"\n\nTwo captured: The Pentagon revealed Monday that two adult men were captured in the operation.\n\n\"There were two adult males taken off the objective alive, they're in our custody,\" Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley told reporters at the Pentagon.\n\nMilley also said that U.S. personnel have disposed of al-Baghdadi's remains after they were transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing.\n\n\"The disposal of his remains has been done and is complete and was handled appropriately,\" Milley said.\n\nMilley also said he didn't know where Trump got the information on al-Baghdadi \"whimpering,\" but left open the possibility the president heard it from someone he hasn't spoked to.\n\n\"I note the president had planned to talk down to the unit and unit members, but I don't know what the source of that was, but I assume it was talking directly to the unit and the unit members,\" said Milley, who added he has not spoken with unit members.\n\nTrump defends not briefing Dems: Democrats celebrated al-Baghdadi's death, but they also criticized Trump for not briefing them ahead of time.\n\n\"The House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration's overall strategy in the region. Our military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiRep. Katie Hill resigns amid ethics probe What battles of the 1970s can teach us about congressional power and the president Pelosi, Schumer call for briefing on death of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi MORE (D-Calif.) said in a statement Sunday.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerSchumer pushes for all-electric vehicle future by 2040 Rep. Elijah Cummings to lie in state in Capitol Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian presses Congress for paid paternity leave MORE (D-N.Y.) also said in a statement Sunday he looks forward to receiving a briefing about the raid and the administration's plan to deal with escaped ISIS prisoners.\n\nOn Monday, Trump defended not briefing Democrats by attacking House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSchiff: Barr 'weaponizing' DOJ 'to go after the president's enemies' Top Trump administration officials hail al-Baghdadi raid but stress need for resolve in fighting ISIS Schiff: 'Bolton is a very important witness' MORE (D-Calif.), who is leading the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\n\"Well, I guess the only thing is they were talking about why didn't I give the information to Adam Schiff and his committee,\" Trump told reporters. \"And the answer is: Because I think Adam Schiff is the biggest leaker in Washington.\"\n\nTrump added that he didn't tell Schiff about because \"he's a corrupt politician\" and \"a leaker like nobody has ever seen before.\"\n\nTop Republicans say they didn't get a briefing either: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell blasts impeachment inquiry as 'kangaroo court' in fundraising pitch Vulnerable Republicans balk at Trump-backed drug pricing bill Romney, Collins, Murkowski only Senate GOP holdouts on Graham's impeachment resolution MORE (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthy'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Overnight Defense: Top general briefs GOP senators on Syria plan | Senators 'encouraged' by briefing | Pence huddles with Republican allies on Syria | Trump nominee sidesteps questions on arms treaties MORE (R-Calif.) separately told reporters Monday they were not given a heads up either.\n\n\"I wasn't, but I was in the similar position when President Obama ordered the attack on Osama bin Laden. I was not called in advance then, nor do I expect to be called in advance now,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nMcCarthy separately told CNN and NBC that he was not notified in advance. A spokesperson for McCarthy confirmed his comments to The Hill.\n\nMcConnell added that the administration reached out to him before the operation went public, but after the raid occurred, but they failed to connect. McConnell was spotted talking with Trump during Sunday night's World Series baseball game.\n\nHero dog captivates: A military dog that was injured in the raid has stolen the hearts of the public.\n\nTrump on Monday tweeted out a declassified photo of the dog, calling the canine \"wonderful.\"\n\n\"We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!\" he tweeted alongside the picture.\n\nMore details on the dog are scarce.\n\nAs Trump mentioned in the tweet, the name is not being release because it is classified.\n\nMilley told reporters dog was \"slightly wounded and fully recovering.\" He added the dog is \"still in theater, returned to duty with its handler.\"\n\nExplaining the classification of the dog's name, Milley said \"it's a classified unit, we're protecting the dog's identity.\"\n\nIMPEACHMENT LATEST: House Democrats will for the first time vote on impeachment procedures on Thursday, a shift in their strategy seemingly meant to cut off GOP arguments about an unfair process.\n\nRep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said Monday that he will introduce a resolution this week to \"ensure transparency\" and \"provide a clear path forward\" in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe text of the resolution has yet to be released, but McGovern plans to introduce it Tuesday ahead of a markup in his committee Wednesday. A senior Democratic aide said that the resolution is expected to hit the House floor on Thursday.\n\nIt would be the first formal vote on the new impeachment process by the House since Pelosi threw her support behind an inquiry in September.\n\nDemocrats have insisted they did not need to hold a floor vote to launch the impeachment inquiry itself, despite calls for such a vote from the White House and Republicans.\n\nPelosi explained the move in a letter to House Democrats that suggested it would give the caucus new leverage with the administration.\n\n\"We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,\" Pelosi wrote in the letter.\n\nThe resolution will not launch the investigation, as Democrats continue to say there is no reason to hold such a vote.\n\nInstead, it is expected to affirm the ongoing investigation and establish procedures for public hearings, authorize the release of witness deposition transcripts and outline the process for transferring evidence to the House Judiciary Committee, which would be tasked with drafting and approving articles of impeachment.\n\nWhite House official refuses to testify: Earlier in the day, House Democrats threatened to charge a key witness in their impeachment investigation with contempt after he defied a subpoena and failed to show up at the Capitol.\n\nSchiff said the lawsuit filed by Charles Kupperman, a deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton John BoltonKey impeachment testimony: What we've learned so far Schiff: 'Bolton is a very important witness' Bolton looms large as impeachment inquiry accelerates MORE, questioning his obligation to appear before Congress \"has no basis in law\" since Kupperman is now a private citizen.\n\nSchiff said Democrats will forge ahead with their impeachment investigation, vowing not to let the White House bog their investigation down in the courts.\n\n\"This is deeply regrettable. He was compelled to appear by a lawful congressional subpoena,\" Schiff told reporters. \"Witnesses like Dr. Kupperman need to do their duty and show up.\"\n\n\"A private citizen cannot sue the Congress to try to avoid coming in when they're served with a lawful subpoena. And we expect that the court will make short shrift of that argument. But nonetheless we move forward.\"\n\nNDAA IN JEOPARDY?: Negotiations over the annual policy bill have stalled amid an impasse over Trump's border wall.\n\nOver the weekend, we took a look at where things stand on this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n\nThe border wall was always expected to be among the most difficult issues in this year's NDAA conference discussions. But grievances from the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees that have spilled into public from the private negotiations suggest a murky path forward for a bill that has been signed into law for nearly 60 years straight.\n\n\"I want to be really clear about this: There is one, and only one, reason why we're not making progress on the bill, and that's the wall,\" House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith David (Adam) Adam SmithTrump wall endangers must-pass defense bill Overnight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room Top Democrats warn against withdrawing from treaty that allows observation flights over Russia MORE (D-Wash.) said.\n\nSenate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe James (Jim) Mountain InhofeThe Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by Nareit \u2014 White House cheers Republicans for storming impeachment hearing GOP senators frustrated with Romney jabs at Trump The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Diplomat's 'powerful' testimony and 'lynching' attract headlines MORE (R-Okla.) said separately that negotiations are \"not going well\" and that the \"border issue is probably the one that is the biggest issue.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for the nominees to be chief management officers of the Pentagon, chief information officer of the Pentagon and general counsel of the Navy at 9:30 a.m. at the Dirksen Senate Office Building, room G-50. https://bit.ly/2WkeltU\n\nThe House Armed Services Committee's Future of Defense Task Force will hold a hearing on \"Theories of Victory\" at 10 a.m. at the Rayburn House Office Building, room 2118. https://bit.ly/36eUIba\n\nA House Foreign Affairs Committee subpanel will hold a hearing on the administration's policy in the Middle East at 2 p.m. at Rayburn 2172. https://bit.ly/2PttUhl\n\nA House Oversight Committee subpanel will hold a hearing on the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency at 2 p.m. at Rayburn 2154. https://bit.ly/2WvGONH\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for the nominees to be ambassadors to the Marshal Islands, Georgia, Lithuania and Albania at 2:30 p.m. at Dirksen 419. https://bit.ly/2JtPcry\n\nICYMI\n\n-- The Hill: Biden: ISIS leader killed despite Trump's 'ineptitude' as commander in chief\n\n-- The Hill: Security increasing at ISIS prisons after al-Baghdadi death\n\n-- The Hill: Opinion: The demise of American soft power\n\n-- The Hill: Opinion: Al-Baghdadi killing heralds Trump's dumping of Afghanistan", "description": "Happy Monday and welcome to\u00a0Overnight Defense.\u00a0I'm Rebecca Kheel, and here's your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_10272019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
