'Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?'\"\n\nThe statement came after The Hollywood Reporter on Monday reported \"South Park\" has been banned from the Chinese internet and that videos, mentions, and discussion forums for the Comedy Central animated series had been removed or shut down.\n\nThe episode \"Band in China\" references China's crackdown on Winnie the Pooh imagery, which has become a symbol of resistance to the country's leading Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping. The Disney movie \"Christopher Robin\" did not even play in China last year.\n\nThe statement from Parker and Stone also mocked the NBA's apology to China after the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted on Friday (and then deleted) an image with the slogan \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\" in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters. The NBA issued a statement that said it was \"regrettable\" that Morey's views \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The most recent episode of \"South Park,\" \"Band in China,\" mocked the country's censorship and Hollywood's reliance on its theatrical market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9203/d5a540711b634c3abe7a4d2fc3f0d51c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
