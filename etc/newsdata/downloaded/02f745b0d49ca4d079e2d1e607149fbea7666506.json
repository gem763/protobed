Pretty much all they watch are the ups and downs in Bitcoin prices and maybe a handful of popular altcoins.\n\nAnd yet, it\u2019s often during quiet periods like this that incremental, fundamental \u2014 even earth-shattering \u2014 events take place behind the scenes.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s a technological innovation that\u2019s on the verge of bursting onto the scene.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s a big company or consortium of companies coming together or breaking apart.\n\nAnd almost invariably, it\u2019s news that not only impacts the industry but could also have far-reaching repercussions on our daily lives in the future.\n\nToday, I will cover one outstanding example in the recent news. I will cover additional ones in the near future.\n\nTelegram Open Network Raises USD 1.7 billion from Private Sales\n\nThe global growth of messaging apps like WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook Messenger has been staggering.\n\nBy year-end, they will have more than two and a half BILLION users.\n\nBefore the end of 2022, they will have close to THREE billion.\n\nAnd in the privacy-oriented world of crypto, the stand-out messaging app is Telegram.\n\nTelegram\u2019s enhanced privacy protection is a key reason why it has catapulted from zero to over 200 million users in less than six years flat.\n\nAnd it\u2019s why Telegram is the object of adoring user loyalty ... hate-laced attacks from detractors ... and never-ending controversy in the highest of circles.\n\nBut the controversy is also the backdrop of Telegram\u2019s most recent endeavor \u2014 to back the launch of its new token, Telegram Open Network (TON).\n\nThanks largely to Telegram\u2019s virtually universal following in the crypto world, TON was quickly able to raise $1.7 billion from private sales.\n\nBut thanks, in part, to an equally universal disdain for Telegram among government regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acted swiftly.\n\nThe SEC obtained a legal order to halt Telegram Group Inc. from distributing its crypto asset, known as Gram. The SEC declared the asset cannot be legally traded in the United States.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson said its emergency action is \u201cintended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold.\u201d\n\nA court hearing to resolve the issue (or not), initially scheduled for Oct. 24, was postponed to February 2020.\n\nTON had already launched its Testnet but has delayed its Mainnet due to the SEC filing.\n\nOur take: The SEC certainly has the authority to block the sale of TON\u2019s Gram tokens in the United States. But whether it can do so globally is questionable.\n\nAnd regardless of fundraising, governmental authorities cannot \u2014 and probably do not plan to \u2014 stop the development of TON\u2019s blockchain technology (more broadly called Distributed Ledger Technology, or DLT).\n\nHowever, this battle has impacted TON public investors in a few negative ways.\n\nFirst, they had to make a hard choice between:\n\nTaking a guaranteed 23% loss on their investment, or ...\n\nBraving the price uncertainty when the token is launched in April 2020 ... and the possibility that it may never be launched.\n\nSecond, public investors who bought the coin at USD 4 will be subject to selling pressure from the first and second rounds of investors whose purchase prices corresponded to 37 cents and USD 1.33, respectively.\n\nThird, this SEC filing could set a precedent and deter both TON and other blockchain projects from raising funds in the U.S. in the future.\n\nRegulatory issues aside, if we focus just on the technology, we need to recognize that ...\n\nTON Has the Potential to Be One of the Fastest Smart-contract Blockchains in the World\n\nTON creates blockchains within blockchains ... and then more blockchains within those. This kind of sharding, they claim, can reach the breakneck speed of one MILLION transactions per second.\n\nTON has 3 primary strengths ...\n\n1. Speed We don\u2019t see one million transactions happening anytime soon. But it will be relatively fast from the get-go.\n\nUsing the standards we\u2019ve created for our Technology Model (one of four models in our Weiss Crypto Ratings), we estimate that TON will be able to hit the ground running with about 10,000 transactions per second. That\u2019s still quite fast for a new wannabe smart-contract Ethereum-killer.\n\n2. Popularity of Telegram Messenger app. In the crypto world, there\u2019s a huge benefit to having the backing of a well-known brand. It makes the critical difference between bursting into the headlines with a huge built-in base of users vs. getting lost among the countless coins that fade and die from lack of attention. TON is definitely among the former.\n\n3. Support infrastructure. TON is deploying Ton Storage for decentralized file storage and the Telegram Messenger app for easy user onboarding.\n\nWeighing the regulatory and fundraising challenges vs. the technological strengths, we still see great potential for growth ... but also for more controversy.\n\nStay tuned. This is bound to get even more interesting very quickly.", "description": "Telegram\u2019s enhanced privacy protection is a key reason why it has catapulted from zero to over 200 million users in less than six years flat.
