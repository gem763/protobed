(AP) - Don\u2019t try to make the argument to Mississippi coach Matt Luke that Saturday night\u2019s 31-17 win over Arkansas wasn\u2019t a work or art.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect. But, it looked good to me. This win really gives us something to build on,\u201d Luke said, whose club won the Southeastern Conference opener for both teams. \u201cI told these men that we would fight through barriers and obstacles together and we played our hearts out together tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Rebels (1-1, 1-0) got a big performance from Matt Corral, who finished 16-of-24 passing for 246 yards, including a pair of touchdown passes to Elijah Moore. Scottie Phillips added scoring runs of 1 and 26 yards and finished with a game-high 143 yards rushing as the Rebels finished with 483 yards of offense.\n\n\u201cI thought Matt Corral was good. He looked much more comfortable this week,\u201d Luke said. \u201cIt was great to see Elijah make plays, too. This is an important win for us. We played with a lot of passion.\u201d\n\nArkansas (1-1, 0-1) stayed within striking distance at 17-10 in the third quarter on a 69-yard fumble return for a touchdown from Kamren Curl. Quarterback Nick Starkel, who replaced Ben Hicks in the second half, had a 6-yard touchdown pass to Koilan Jackson in the final two minutes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to win in the SEC on the road. It\u2019s really hard when you make as many mistakes as we did tonight,\u201d Arkansas coach Chad Morris said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to walk back in that locker room. Now, it\u2019s about a response.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nArkansas: It was a disappointing continuation of SEC woes. The Razorbacks have lost 12 consecutive conference games and are 1-17 since November, 2016, the final season under former head coach Bret Bielema. The defense, highlighted by Curl\u2019s brilliant individual play, wore out in the final quarter. The offense took a huge step backward and had only one trip to the red zone while the issue was in doubt, capped by a 36-yard field goal by Connor Limpert.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let this go on to next week,\u201d Starkel said. \u201cWe have to live by the 24-hour rule and let it go. I think we will do that.\u201d\n\nOle Miss: After closing last season with five consecutive SEC losses, winning the league opener was crucial. A roster filled with newcomers and underclassmen, along with two new coordinators - Rich Rodriguez on offense and Mike MacIntyre on defense - appears to be meshing as head coach Matt Luke predicted. The new-look units may not be ready to challenge the SEC heavyweights yet, but the encouraging conference win indicates the Rebels are trending up in a drive for bowl eligibility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get better,\u201d Corral said. \u201cWeek by week, we\u2019ve got to get on this stuff and get better. But, this is a good win, a team win.\u201d\n\nKEY PLAY\n\nTrailing 10-3 midway through the third quarter, Starkel had a 38-yard touchdown pass to Trey Knox wiped out by an ineligible player downfield penalty. The Razorbacks turned the ball over on downs two plays later. Ole Miss answered with a 71-yard touchdown drive to build what proved to be an insurmountable 17-3 lead.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArkansas: The Razorbacks play the next three games at home, beginning with Colorado State on Saturday.\n\nOle Miss: The Rebels host Southeastern Louisiana on Saturday in the second game of a three-game home stand.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Don't try to make the argument to Mississippi coach Matt Luke that Saturday night's 31-17 win over Arkansas wasn't a work or art.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Chris Burrows"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/arkansas_mississippi_football_61047_c0-387-3066-2174_s1770x1032.jpg?816b18d790f199e9e2d61a885be26a0613eaee88", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
