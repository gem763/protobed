So many people signed up that it morphed into multiple music festivals.\n\nA festival seemed a little more practical than capturing aliens, but people didn\u2019t let the raid go. Yes, it would appear that not everyone is totally joking about the raid.\n\nIntrigued by the most enduringly popular meme of the year that was clearly a complete joke, enthusiasts were still determined to get as close as they could to Area 51, as evidenced by the Area 51 YouTube videos and livestreams.\n\nSo even if you couldn\u2019t get in on the revelry, you can check out all of the visitors documenting their comical \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\n\nThere were plenty of people storming but not exactly really storming Area 51.\n\n\u201cThe guards were unbelievably nice. They took photos with everyone and were pretty much just smiling,\u201d Danny Philippou, an Australian YouTuber who joined the festivities told TIME.\n\nOne woman did enter, walking beyond the facility\u2019s gates, captured in this video shared to Twitter.\n\nAttendee Ellie Urquhart walks past a security line as people gather to \"storm\" Area 51 at an entrance to the military facility near Rachel, Nevada on September 20, 2019.

(Brothers of Alien Rock, the Weird Kids and Speed of Light are among the bands who told TIME they\u2019re going to perform at the festival in Rachel.)\n\nBRIDGET BENNETT&AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow many people went to the Area 51 Raid event?\n\nPredictably there was no alien activity uncovered, but that doesn\u2019t mean anyone stopped believing. About 3,000 people turned up for the gathering for the fun of it. And most of them did not try to storm the gates, the Lincoln County Sherif\u2019s Office told CNN. Restraint! Somewhat surprisingly, two YouTubers did attempt to visit the site before the weekend, despite seeing the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, and were promptly arrested for trespassing.\n\nBoundary crossing wasn\u2019t unexpected. District Attorney Dylan Frehner expressed fears of \u201cunlawful activity\u201d like trespassing \u2014 on both private and federal land in an interview with TIME prior to the arrivals. \u201cOur county has 5,000 people in it, we have a very limited budget and resources. Every time we have mass numbers of people that may be gathering there\u2019s always gonna be some concern,\u201d Frehner said.\n\nSo for those interested in actually storming the gates, this is no joke. And on Friday, at least two people were escorted away from an Area 51 gate and detained, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAdditionally, the Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said that a Canadian citizen was arrested for indecent exposure and another attendee was arrested for reasons related to alcohol.\n\nArea 51 Raid results\n\nThe majority of the crowds came in peace. And they came prepared with the best signs, tin foil hats, Naruto headbands, chants of \u201cclap them cheeks, clap them cheeks!\u201d (original event reference,) and positive attitudes.\n\nAlien-hunters gather to \"storm\" Area 51 at an entrance to the military facility near Rachel, Nevada on September 20, 2019. BRIDGET BENNETT&AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen the original viral event creator, Matty Roberts, backed out of the Rachel, Nev., citing safety concerns, it appeared that things would be more manageable because he was expected to be a big draw.\n\n\u201cFrankly, we are breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Joerg Arnu, an active Rachel resident since 2003 who previously told TIME that he was against Alienstock. \u201cIt feels like mission accomplished.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the weekend, the gathering was mostly just fun-loving enthusiasts coming together.\n\nAnd of course, opportunities to stage a faux raid were everywhere.\n\nIt would appear, raiders\u2014with a sense of humor\u2014weren\u2019t entirely unwelcome.
