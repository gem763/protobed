(AP) - A judge on Monday ordered former Michigan State University President Lou Ann Simon to stand trial on charges that she lied to police about her knowledge of a sexual misconduct complaint against now-imprisoned sports doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nThe ruling came the same day the school revealed that a trustee resigned Saturday over the governing board\u2019s decision last month to drop an independent review of Nassar\u2019s assaults, despite having unanimously voted for the probe in June.\n\nNancy Schlichting, in a letter to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, said it became clear to her that four trustees do not share the commitment by Schlichting and three other trustees to an independent review, including the release of documents protected by attorney-client privilege \u201cso the truth can come out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI deeply regret that my board service has been so short, but hope that the next appointed trustee will be able to make a greater impact than I have,\u201d she wrote.\n\nEaton County District Judge Julie Reincke, meanwhile, found probable cause to send Simon to trial on two felony and two misdemeanor charges of giving false statements to law enforcement agents who accused her of impeding their investigation into one of Nassar\u2019s sexual assaults and whether she or other university officials committed misconduct in office.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed by the district court\u2019s ruling in light of the complete lack of evidence to support the charges against Lou Anna Simon. We plan to vigorously defend Dr. Simon and will be appealing the decision of the district court,\u201d said Lee Silver, one of her lawyers. \u201cWe remain confident that we will ultimately prevail and that Lou Anna Simon will be fully acquitted of these charges.\u201d\n\nShe is the third former school official to be ordered to trial.\n\nAuthorities have said Simon knew in 2014 that Nassar had been accused of molesting a patient at a campus clinic, and that she knew of the nature of the complaint. But Simon told police she knew only that a complaint had been filed against a sports doctor and did not become aware of the substance of the review that sparked the school\u2019s Title IX investigation or the complaint\u2019s nature until 2016.\n\nThe judge said the evidence suggests that Simon discussed Amanda Thomashow\u2019s sex abuse allegations against Nassar with a senior adviser, Paulette Granberry Russell.\n\n\u201cIt is not credible to believe that Simon would have heard even the outline of Thomashow\u2019s story and forgotten it,\u201d Reincke wrote.\n\nNassar has been sentenced to decades in prison for sexually assaulting athletes, mostly female gymnasts, at Michigan State and a Lansing-area gymnastics club. Former Olympians said he also molested them in Texas and overseas while he worked for USA Gymnastics.\n\nIn September, a day before MSU Board of Trustees Chairwoman Dianne Byrum announced that the outside review was being scrapped, the federal government ordered the school to make sweeping changes and pay a $4.5 million fine for failing to adequately respond to complaints against Nassar.\n\nByrum said then that the board was split over \u201cdefining the scope of work\u201d that was to be done by Chicago-based law firm McDermott Will & Emery to investigate and release a public report. A previous internal review led by New York-based firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom had come under criticism because the firm was also assisting the university in anticipation of civil lawsuits and facilitating cooperation with law enforcement following Nassar\u2019s 2016 arrest. No report was made public.\n\nThree Nassar victims who worked with the board to initiate the investigation - Rachael Denhollander, Sarah Klein and Sterling Riethman - have accused Byrum and three other trustees of a \u201cbetrayal.\u201d They have called on new MSU President Samuel Stanley Jr. to use his executive authority to launch an internal probe, which they say is needed because the state attorney general\u2019s criminal investigation and the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s investigations cover \u201ca small portion of what went wrong.\u201d\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office is prosecuting Simon, has called for the school to waive its attorney-client privilege and release nearly 6,000 documents. Stanley has said it is up to the trustees, who have deadlocked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that she is stepping down, but I wish her much personal success and happiness with her other projects,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe valued her insight and contributions while she was with us.\u201d\n\nSchlichting was appointed last December by then-Gov. Rick Snyder to fill a vacancy. Whitmer will name someone to serve the rest of the term through 2022, when the seat will be up for election.\n\n\u201cShe is committed to appointing someone who will work together with President Stanley and the remaining board members to build a campus culture that respects diversity, listens to survivors, and makes a college education more affordable and accessible for Michigan families,\u201d said Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Eggert on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A judge on Monday ordered former Michigan State University President Lou Ann Simon to stand trial on charges that she lied to police about her knowledge of a sexual misconduct complaint against now-imprisoned sports doctor Larry Nassar.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Eggert"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/doctor_sexual_assault_michigan_state_76672_c0-124-2990-1868_s1200x700.jpg?d681813b8507cc4344b2bfb45d20092c0a7b7fee", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
