USA TODAY\n\nLeBron James set off a firestorm Monday night when he called out Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey for the timing of his tweet in support of the Hong Kong protesters that resulted in turmoil for the NBA during their preseason trip to China last week.\n\nWhile James went so far to call Morey \"misinformed\" on how China would react to his tweet, he was met by many detractors who felt his comments offered support for a Chinese regime that stifles free speech \u2014 one being Enes Kanter.\n\nKanter is in a longstanding feud with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan that has resulted in him being exiled from his homeland and facing constant threats. The Boston Celtics center tweeted a list of intimidation he and his family have been a victim to over the last five years, with the line \"FREEDOM IS NOT FREE\" at the end.\n\n-Haven\u2019t seen or talked to my family 5 years\n\n-Jailed my dad\n\n-My siblings can\u2019t find jobs\n\n-Revoked my passport\n\n-International arrest warrant\n\n-My family can\u2019t leave the country\n\n-Got Death Threats everyday\n\n-Got attacked, harassed\n\n-Tried to kidnap me in Indonesia\n\n\n\nFREEDOM IS NOT FREE \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nThat tweet followed three others that appear to be reactions to James' comments.\n\nWow dude! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nSMH \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\n\ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, Kanter and rookie center Tacko Fall were confronted by men Kanter claimed to be Erdogan supporters outside of a Boston-area mosque where they had just finished a prayer service between practices.\n\nKanter did not travel to London while with the New York Knicks last season out of fear for his life. And this summer, the 27-year-old had to cancel a free youth basketball camp due to a threat he received.\n\nKanter has been outspoken in his opposition of Erdogan. Three years ago, he supported the failed coup d'etat by Fetullah G\u00fclen. Earlier Monday, he tweeted his support of the recent sanctions placed on Turkey by the Trump administration.", "description": "LeBron James added another layer to the NBA's China situation by not supporting Daryl Morey's tweet.
