Quite the opposite. If I took enough coke I could stay hard for days,\" he added.\n\n(Image: Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images)\n\nThe Rocketman singer said the drug opened his mind to new sexual experimentation.\n\n\"It takes all the inhibitions out of people. Even straight guys sometimes,\" he recalls.\n\nElton said that the Hollywood mansion he purchased in 1975 became the backdrop for many of his sex parties.\n\n\"I mostly used the snooker room to seduce guys. Strip snooker! It usually seemed to do the trick, especially after a couple of lines of coke,\" he says.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nElton added that sometimes he wouldn't take part and would sit and observe other men instead: \"I just watched, took Polaroids, organised things.\"\n\nA now 72-year-old Elton says he believes that not being that interested in having sex himself saved his life with multiple ex-partners of his becoming HIV - positive.\n\n\"If I had been [having sex], I\u2019d almost certainly be dead,\" he said.\n\n(Image: Publicity Picture)\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nElton's musician pals, including Freddie Mercury and George Harrison, urged him for years to check into rehab and kick his cocaine habit.\n\nBut the singer always refused.\n\nIt wasn't until his boyfriend Hugh Williams sought help that Elton decided to join him in the 1990s and managed to get clean.\n\nDespite giving up drugs and booze a long time ago, Elton said he still has recurring nightmares about his former addiction.\n\n\"When I wake up, I can almost feel the numbing sensation of the coke sliding down the back of my throat \u2014 always the part of doing it that I hated \u2014 and I just think \u2018thank God that\u2019s over.'\"", "description": "The now 72-year-old singer opened up about his raging sexual appetite in new memoir, Me", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Daniele Venturelli Getty Images", "Redferns", "Publicity Picture", "Wireimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561551.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS195590283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
