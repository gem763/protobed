We might not like it, but the days in which Europe could for a minimal fee find shelter under the American safety umbrella are over,\u201d Prime Minister Rutte said in comments reported by Euractiv on Thursday.\n\nAdmitting that there was \u201cno alternative\u201d to the U.S.-backed alliance, Mr Rutte said during a lecture at the Atlantic Commission: \u201cThe Netherlands, Europe, we cannot guarantee our safety. But Europe can and should do more.\u201d\n\nAt the 2014 Wales summit, NATO members agreed they would increase defence spending to two per cent of GDP by 2024.\n\nIn 2016, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump criticised EU nations for failing to pay their fair share towards the defence union, an alliance founded in 1949 primarily to protect Europe from then-Soviet Russia.\n\nThe USA funds around 70 per cent of NATO, according to Reuters, spending 3.4 per cent of GDP on defence. Three years ago, just five out of the then-27 members \u2014 the USA, UK, Greece, Poland, and Estonia \u2014 were hitting at least the minimum target.\n\nNoting that President Trump \u201cmakes no secret of\u2026 the fact that the disproportionate division of costs within NATO is a thorn in his side\u201d, Prime Minister Rutte agreed with the U.S. President\u2019s criticisms.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I can only show a lot of understanding for that,\u201d he said.\n\nNATO Chief Agrees With Donald Trump, Europe Should Stump Up More Cash For Military Alliance https://t.co/KxcgHd1lAI pic.twitter.com/KgmShhaCu9 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 8, 2016\n\nAs President, Mr Trump has continued to highlight the discrepancy, calling out \u201cdelinquent\u201d members at the NATO breakfast meeting in Brussels, Belgium, in 2018.\n\n\u201cMany countries are not paying what they should, and, frankly, many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money from many years back,\u201d President Trump had said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re delinquent, as far as I\u2019m concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them,\u201d he added.\n\nSince 2016, several countries have increased or pledged to increase their defence spending as a result of President Trump\u2019s pressure on the issue. Romania hit the target in 2017, with countries like Hungary pledging to do the same in coming years.\n\nNow expanded to 28 members, seven countries \u2014 the U.S., UK, Greece, Estonia, Poland, Romania, and Latvia \u2014 are hitting the minimum two per cent.\n\nTrump Criticises \u2018Delinquent\u2019 NATO Allies on Military Spending https://t.co/m7BxHfCFQb \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 11, 2018\n\nNotably absent in that list are Western European countries, bar the United Kingdom.\n\nNATO estimates for 2019 reveal that countries like Germany (1.36 per cent), Denmark (1.35 per cent), and France (1.84 per cent) are below target. Non-European countries like Turkey (1.89 per cent) and Canada (1.27 per cent) also need to increase spending to meet their obligations.\n\nWhile Mr Rutte has called for increased spending on defence, he admitted planned increases by the Netherlands \u201cwon\u2019t get us to two per cent by 2024\u201d.\n\nGermany has said that it was going to miss the 2024 level. But in February, the country admitted that it was going to miss its own, much reduced, internal spending target as well.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart London in June 2018, U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell said of Germany\u2019s defence spending: \u201cIt is woeful; Germany is the largest economy in Europe. They made a commitment to NATO, and they should be serious about that commitment; it is a multilateral institution that guarantees the allies, guaranteeing freedom.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the media reported that German army personnel were forced to use broom handles during a NATO joint exercise in 2014 because they did not have enough training weapons.\n\nGerman Civilians Least Committed to NATO Alliance, Least Likely to Support Defending Allies https://t.co/asZGcMvJAd \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 4, 2019", "description": "Mark Rutte told European countries to heed the call of U.S. President Donald Trump and pay their fair share to sustain NATO.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/11/NATO.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
