REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nOn Thursday, Turkey agreed in talks with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to a five-day pause in an offensive into northeastern Syria to allow time for the Kurdish fighters to withdraw from a \u201csafe zone\u201d Ankara aims to establish near the Turkish border with Syria.\n\nThe truce also aimed to ease a crisis triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision earlier this month to withdraw all 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria, a move criticized in Washington and elsewhere as a betrayal of loyal Kurdish allies who had fought for years alongside U.S. troops against Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. withdrawal continues apace from northeastern Syria... we\u2019re talking weeks not days,\u201d Esper told reporters en route to the Middle East, adding that it was being carried out through aircraft and ground convoys.\n\n\u201cThe current game plan is for those forces to re-position into western Iraq,\u201d Esper said, adding that they would number about one thousand.\n\nHe said the mission for those troops would be to \u201chelp defend Iraq\u201d and carry out a counter-Islamic State mission.\n\nA senior U.S. defense official clarified that the situation was still fluid and plans could change.\n\nAny decision to send additional U.S. troops to Iraq is likely to be heavily scrutinized in a country where Iran has been steadily amassing influence.\n\n\u201cThat is the current game plan, things can change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal but that is the game plan right now,\u201d the senior official added.\n\nIt is unclear whether the U.S. troops will use Iraq as a base to launch ground raids into Syria and carry out airstrikes against Islamic State militants.\n\nThe additional U.S. troops would add to the more than 5,000 American troops already based in the country, training Iraqi forces and helping to ensure that Islamic State militants do not resurge.\n\nWhile Esper said he had spoken with his Iraqi counterpart and will continue to have conversations in the future, the move will likely be viewed with skepticism by some in Iraq.\n\nIraq is in the midst of a political crisis, as mass protests have led to more than 100 deaths and 6,000 injuries during the week starting Oct. 1.\n\nIran\u2019s role in responding to the demonstrations has been another reminder of Tehran\u2019s reach in Iraq, where a sizable number of former militia commanders are now members of parliament and support the Iranian agenda.\n\nSYRIA CEASEFIRE \u201cGENERALLY\u201d HOLDING\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that Turkey would press on with its offensive into northeastern Syria and \u201ccrush the heads of terrorists\u201d if a deal with Washington on the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the area was not fully implemented.\n\nOn Saturday the fragile truce was holding along the border, with a few Turkish military vehicles crossing the border, Reuters journalists at the scene said. In the last 36 hours, there have been 14 \u201cprovocative attacks\u201d from Syria, Turkey\u2019s defense ministry said.\n\nEsper said that the ceasefire in northeastern Syria was generally holding.\n\n\u201cI think overall the ceasefire generally seems to be holding, we see a stabilization of the lines, if you will, on the ground, and we do get reports of intermittent fires, this and that, that doesn\u2019t surprise me necessarily,\u201d he added.\n\nThere has been concern that the Turkish incursion into northeastern Syria would allow Islamic State militants to make gains and see militants escaping prisons guarded by Kurdish fighters.\n\nEsper said that the United States was still in contact with the Kurdish fighters, known as the YPG, and they appeared to continue to defend the prisons in areas they still controlled.", "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Saturday that all of the nearly 1,000 troops withdrawing from northern Syria are expected to move to western Iraq to continue the campaign against Islamic State militants and \"to help defend Iraq.\"", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442859557&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J01Y", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
