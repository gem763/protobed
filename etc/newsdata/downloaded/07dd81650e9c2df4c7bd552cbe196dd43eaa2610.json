The party's support is seen as key to getting Brexit through the Commons.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, said: \u201cThis sell out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected.\"\n\nEU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker posted on Twitter: \"Where there is a will, there is a #deal - we have one! It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that #EUCO endorses this deal.\"\n\nIn a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk, Mr Juncker said he still \"deeply regrets\" the outcome of the 2016 referendum but said that the EU was \"best served by an orderly and amicable withdrawal of the UK from our union\".\n\nHe ended the letter saying: \"I have indicated to you in the past that I believe it is high time to complete the withdrawal process and move on, as swiftly as possible, to the negotiation on the European Union's future partnership with the UK.\"\n\nMr Corbyn said in his statement: \"From what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected.\n\n\u201cThese proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations.\n\n\u201cThis sell out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u201d\n\nJo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, reiterated her party's demand for a second referendum.\n\nShe tweeted: \"The next few days will shape the future of our country for generations. I am more determined than ever to #StopBrexit and give the public the final say in a #PeoplesVote.\"\n\nThe pound, meanwhile, hit a five-month high against the US dollar following the announcement.\n\nThis page is being updated.", "description": "A Brexit deal has been agreed with the EU, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.Mr Johnson said the government's agreement is a \"great new deal\" and urged MPs to \"get Brexit done\" during Saturday's special sitting of Parliament.", "authors": ["James Morris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fHzzU2RFpoFNnKY2CVWJyQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/d4e555f3e35011b62b5846ca60e79b15", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
