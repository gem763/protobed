So I will strip.\u2019\n\nKate Garraway seemed pretty taken by Jake\u2019s soap debut and compared him to Magic Mike, adding: \u2018Can I just say, you are building towards some stripping role here. Ben\u2019s not wrong, you\u2019ve got a super slow-mo going on.\u2019\n\nBen Shepherd wondered: \u2018When\u2019s the stripping scene?\u2019 to which Jake teased: \u2018Tune into Channel 4.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s get Woody back on Hollyoaks (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nWhile he was confident enough to whip his top off, Jake admits he was \u2018nervous\u2019 to star in the award-winning soap.\n\n\u2018So surreal because I\u2019ve done the reality stuff but there\u2019s only so much longevity in that,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Hollyoaks came to watch and then they offered me this little role. It was really surreal.\n\n\u2018I was nervous, I was sat at home with my girl and I was terrified because you\u2019re always going to get a bit of grief on Twitter.\u2019\n\nBut he added optimistically: \u2018I loved it, I said about three things but I was so happy. Working on the show, you see how much hard work goes into it anyway. The cast are all amazing and everyone behind-the-scenes were great.
