While Yang claimed to \u201cunderstand the spirit and intent of it,\u201d he went on to say that it could be a disaster to actually implement. Supporters of Elizabeth Warren, who initially cooked up this constitutionally dubious idea, and Bernie Sanders, who recently one-upped her on it, are not going to be thrilled with Mr. Yang\u2019s evaluation, as sensible as it may be. (CNBC)\n\nSome of the top contenders in the Democratic presidential primary have called for a wealth tax on America\u2019s top earners. But entrepreneur Andrew Yang, whose profile in the primary race has risen in recent months, told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood that the policy could be a \u201cdisaster in practice.\u201d Yang\u2019s campaign is built around a starkly different, though no less bold, plan to overhaul the economy: a so-called universal basic income in which all U.S. citizens receive $1,000 a month with \u201cno strings attached.\u201d Yang claims the plan, which he calls a \u201cfreedom dividend,\u201d would protect the jobs and well-being of Americans whose livelihoods are threatened by automation and technological innovation.\n\nThe Democratic base remains hungry for any form of proposal designed to tax the rich. (More correctly, to punish the rich, but tax sounds more civil.) So this isn\u2019t going to do much to improve Yang\u2019s already dismal standing. His RCP average currently sits at 3.6, though he has managed to get above five a couple of times recently. So it\u2019s not as if he has that much to lose.\n\nMore interesting is the coherent argument he lays out against the wealth tax, though he leaves out one major point. What he failed to talk about was the question of whether or not the federal government could legally impose a wealth tax. Some analysts think it might sneak past a court challenge, but it would be a long time coming.\n\nEven ignoring the constitutional questions, Yang did manage to point out a number of factors that would make such a scheme highly problematic. These include:\n\n\u2013 Capital flight, with wealthy people renouncing their citizenship\n\n\u2013 The logistical issues of inventorying everyone\u2019s wealth every year\n\n-Compliance problems, since wealthy people will have zero interest in having their wealth inventoried and then being sent a massive bill\n\nThese are all valid concerns. Even if you could manage to pass a tax like this and have it survive a challenge in the courts on constitutional grounds, putting it into effect would probably be a nightmare. You\u2019d need an entirely new arm of IRS enforcement personnel doing nothing but chasing down records of people\u2019s property and then hunting them down to prise the taxes from them.\n\nThe interview with Yang did remind us of his own plan to deal with wealth inequality. That\u2019s his guaranteed basic income scheme where everyone, including those unable or unwilling to work, would get one thousand dollars per month with no strings attached. That\u2019s only around 3.5 trillion a year we\u2019d be shelling out. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to come up with that by taxing some rich people, right?", "description": "No longer Mr. Popularity", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dem-debate-july2.jpeg"}
