Inflated expectations can even lead to worse outcomes, including higher dropout rates.\n\nHere are the most important facts to know as you navigate the college admissions process and decide how much to spend.\n\nMost colleges accept most applicants\n\nThe frenzy around college admission \u2014 and the notion that it\u2019s hard to get into a \u201cgood\u201d school \u2014 focuses mostly on deeply flawed ratings systems and a handful of institutions that admit a fraction of their applicants, such as those involved in the college admissions scandal: Stanford University, which accepted less than 5% of applicants last year, Yale University (6%), University of Southern California (11%) and Georgetown University (14%).\n\nLooking at 2017 data, Pew Research Center counted just 46 schools with admission rates under 20%. Only 17 schools had single-digit admission rates. By contrast, 80% of the 1,364 colleges and universities Pew studied admitted half or more of those who applied. And 53% admitted at least two-thirds of their applicants.\n\nKids who don\u2019t get into one of the 46 highly selective schools typically have plenty of other good options.\n\nSelective doesn\u2019t mean better outcomes\n\nElite schools don\u2019t produce happier or more successful people. A 2014 study of nearly 30,000 college graduates found no correlation between a college\u2019s admissions rate and future job satisfaction or well-being.\n\nEarlier studies by the late Alan Krueger of Princeton and Stacy Dale at Mathematica Policy Research found students who were admitted to highly selective colleges but who attended schools elsewhere usually did just as well financially.\n\nElite schools did increase incomes significantly for black, Hispanic and low-income students, and those whose parents didn\u2019t graduate from college, Krueger and Dale found. Another group of researchers, however, discovered that highly selective schools didn\u2019t have a lock on helping disadvantaged students.\n\nMany of the schools that increased opportunities the most for low-income students were much lower cost public universities such as the California State University and City University of New York systems.\n\nMajors matter most\n\nParents mistakenly believe brand-name schools impress employers and lead to more opportunities. Researcher Paul Hill, who analyzed millions of admissions and salary records for student loan lenders, didn\u2019t find that to be true. Consistently, a graduate\u2019s major had a far bigger impact, says Hill, president of Job Search Intelligence in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cA kid with a degree in cybersecurity \u2026 is going to come in at three times the salary of someone who graduated from Harvard with a soft degree, you know, liberal arts, humanities, whatever,\u201d says Hill, who also heads the nonprofit Educate to Career, which offers college admission and outcome data to families.\n\n\u201cThe skillset is what matters, not the name (of the school) on the diploma,\u201d he says.\n\n\u2018Reach\u2019 schools can be risky\n\nCounselors and parents often encourage seniors to apply to \u201creach\u201d schools, colleges where a student\u2019s test scores, class rank, grades or other qualifications are below the school\u2019s average. The idea is that even though the odds are against admission, students might get lucky.\n\nGetting into one of these schools may not be a blessing, however. Hill found that students in the bottom 25% of those admitted typically get less generous financial aid packages and are more likely to drop out or flunk out. At most colleges, he says, scrambling for a place at a school that doesn\u2019t really want your kid can backfire into a higher bill and a discouraged student.\n\n\u201cParents get fixated on getting their kid into the best school possible,\u201d Hill says. \u201cThey\u2019re setting themselves up for frustration.\u201d\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nHunger on Campus: How College Students Can Get Help\n\nBe First in Line for College Aid by Filing the FAFSA Now\n\nHard-Won Tips From Borrowers Who Got Student Loan Forgiveness\n\nLiz Weston is a writer at NerdWallet.
