The weather reflected the dullness of the affair \u2014 rain falling constantly on a half-filled stadium, with many of the drenched fans in attendance rooting for the 49ers.\n\nWhy else would you care about San Francisco playing Washington except for this being a Shanahan blood game?\n\nWashington opened up the contest with an impressive 60-yard drive, led by Adrian Peterson rushing for 49, and it appeared, briefly, that the script would flip, that Shanahan might have to leave the city without avnging his family honor. Then the Redskins, dutifully, reverted to form.\n\nDustin Hopkins missed a 39-yard field goal, and the Redskins squandered two other opportunities with a fumble and a failed 4th-down conversion.\n\nSan Francisco struggled with the sloppy conditions that limited their offense, not scoring until late in the third quarter, when Robbie Gould hit a 28-yard field goal to give the 49ers a 3-0 lead. They would add two more field goals, but three points was all Shanahan needed to be able to stand up in the press conference and claim victory for family honor.\n\nThis was the 39-year-old coach\u2019s answer to my question:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in a number of buildings and not all of it always ends good. But it had nothing to do with the game. Everyone\u2019s a little more sensitive, being that things involve your family, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m always a little more sensitive to this with my dad here, and that\u2019s why it was nice to get the win. But it definitely had nothing to do with the game, nothing to do with the score, but you always want to take care of things the right way when you\u2019re bothered by some things that happened to a family member.\u201d\n\nIt had nothing to do with the game, but you want to take care of things the right way.\n\nNot exactly Michael Corleone, but he made it clear that you don\u2019t go against the family.\n\nShanahan smiled when he was answering the question, as if he was waiting for someone to ask it, and was more than happy to let the world know that in the ugly battle that resulted in his father being fired, this was the Shanahans coming back to exact a small measure of revenge.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the son\u2019s first time back as the 49ers\u2019 coach \u2014 he was here in 2017 when the Redskins won 26-24. But that was his first year, coaching a losing 6-10 team. The Redskins were considered a playoff contender that season, though they would finish 7-9, just one game better than San Francisco.\n\nThis year, Shanahan may have the best team in the NFC, with the 49ers remaining undefeated now at 6-0, while the Redskins wallow at 1-6, having fired the coach who replaced Mike Shanahan, Jay Gruden.\n\nThis time, it felt like more than a game.\n\nThis time, Shanahan presented the game ball to his father Mike. In lieu of Snyder\u2019s homecoming crown, it would have to do.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
