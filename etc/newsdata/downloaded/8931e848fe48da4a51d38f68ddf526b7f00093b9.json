The vast majority of Americans who do not get to plan or attend closed-door fund-raisers with people who make their money from killing the planet usually think of these dirty affairs as quid pro quo investments in a candidate\u2019s future policy decisions\u2014and for reasons that are completely fair. What is one supposed to think when a candidate spends their time raising money from plutocrats who siphon their profits straight from the pump of oppressive inequality? How could spending so much time in conversation with these sorts not influence a candidate\u2019s perceptions of policy? And wouldn\u2019t such donors simply refuse to give money to any candidate who genuinely threatened their interests?\n\n\n\nThese are all fair assessments of the political fund-raising world. But tantrums like Rendell\u2019s expose the truth that the membership of the donor class, despite having enough money to effectively immunize them against the political choices that unravel the lives of ordinary people, are also just socially stunted people who use campaign money as currency in their social relationships, and whose personal feelings have a great effect on who and what they support. In one way, it would be much simpler if they did simply view these fund-raisers as handing over bags of cash in exchange for policy favors. Then, at least, these machinations would be less impenetrable.\n\n\n\nThe Times piece that detailed Warren\u2019s previous high-dollar fund-raising had a similarly revealing quote from Stephen Silberstein, a Democratic mega-donor who has given millions of dollars to Democratic fund-raising vehicles. Silberstein \u201chad Ms. Warren over to his San Francisco-area home\u201d for fund-raisers in the past, but \u201cbristled when he first heard Ms. Warren would stop doing events like the dinner he had held for her,\u201d according to the paper. In fact, he told the Times, his \u201cfirst reaction\u201d was that he was \u201cinsulted\u201d by her rejection. For millionaires who dabble in politics, getting shut out of a candidate\u2019s rise to office is a snub, like seeing your friends post photos of their brunch without you. It was hypocritical of you to ghost me, Senator. Never mind the policy issues, never mind the people whose literal lives are on the line in this election: Was it something I said? Was the chicken dry?\n\n\n\nMore than anything, it betrays the fact that these big donors don\u2019t get involved for reasons of pure, high-minded civic virtue. In his op-ed, Rendell disputes Warren\u2019s implication that rich people donate the maximum amount to candidates because \u201cthey believe it will get them a federal job, win their business a federal contract or even gain special access.\u201d Instead, he says, they simply \u201cbelieve strongly that the candidate would make a great leader, or maybe they believe in the candidate\u2019s values or policies on the important issues challenging the country.\u201d Maybe they believe their ideas are good, or whatever. He asserts that he\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d that \u201cthe crowd at the Biden fund-raiser gave money to him for the same reason\u201d he did\u2014that Biden is the best candidate.\n\n\n\nRendell is surely worth more money than most of us, but his value\u2014and danger\u2014as a political fund-raiser is that he leverages connections made in his long career in politics to raise money for candidates for office and in doing so, has a great effect on which kinds of candidates can succeed. An Intercept piece by Paul Perry, who quit his primary challenge against a better-funded Democrat for a congressional seat in Pennsylvania, recounted a meeting he had with Rendell and two Democratic fund-raisers, which illuminates Rendell\u2019s approach to political fund-raising:\n\n", "description": "There's a solid dirty money case to be made against the Democratic contender, but Ed Rendell is the wrong person to litigate it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/cb8d3eecd4b54229550596b2e72015d4790b9a72.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
