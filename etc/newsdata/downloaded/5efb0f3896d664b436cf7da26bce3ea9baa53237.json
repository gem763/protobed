Personal savings continued to be run down in the second quarter, with the household savings ratio falling to 2.3% from 3.0% in the first quarter.\n\nThe escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is also a threat to Australia's outlook, but that's not evident at the moment. Data released Tuesday showed that Australia posted its first current accounts surplus in 44 years in the second quarter, helped by a jump in iron ore prices, and weaker imports.\n\nStill, a slowdown in world growth will eventually damp commodity prices more generally, putting a brake on growth in resources-exporting economies like Australia.\n\n-Write to James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 03, 2019 21:47 ET (01:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
