In a mix containing just 1 percent seaweed, the cows\u2019 methane emissions went down by a stunning 60 percent.\n\n\u201cIn all the years that I\u2019ve worked in this area, I\u2019ve never seen anything that reduced it that much,\u201d Kebreab said.\n\nA 2012 United Nations report revealed that the earth\u2019s cattle population produces more carbon dioxide than automobiles, planes, and all other forms of transport combined. Moreover, the cow pies they drop and the wind they break produce a third of the world\u2019s methane emissions, which traps 84 times as much heat as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, EcoWatch published an article confirming that greenhouse gas emissions from livestock actually account for a higher percentage of total global emissions than the world\u2019s 1.2 billion automobiles.\n\nKebreab\u2019s cow experiment sought to replicate results from researchers at Australia\u2019s James Cook University, who mixed bacteria from cows\u2019 digestive systems with red seaweed and discovered a significant decrease in methane production. Their experiment suggested that tweaking a cow\u2019s diet to include 2 percent seaweed could reduce its methane emissions by as much as 99 percent.\n\nLast March, Kebreab and his team initiated a more expansive version of his cow study, using 21 steers over a period of six months. Preliminary results reportedly mirror those of the earlier experiment, but the final analysis will not be ready until December.\n\nPaul Dobbins, a senior specialist at the World Wildlife Fund and former president of a kelp farm in Maine, said that seaweed could provide a key remedy for bovine gas emissions.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to rebuild 10,000 power plants in the world. You basically create a modest feed additive that has a big leverage effect,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Dobbins, seaweed farming may be a \u201ctriple win.\u201d It furnishes a way to grow nutritious food for both cows and people, provides coastal jobs, and improves the marine environment.\n\n\u201cEverything you do in food production has pluses and minuses relative to the environment,\u201d he has claimed. \u201cSeaweed farming, if done correctly, actually comes out more on the plus side.\u201d\n\nWhile flatulence is an issue, studies have suggested that cow belching is a much bigger problem because of the methane produced in cows\u2019 stomachs.\n\n\u201cDespite misconceptions, most cow methane comes from burps (90%) rather than farts (10%),\u201d Michael Battaglia wrote in October, 2016, in the Conversation.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Environmentalists have proposed adding seaweed to cows' diets to diminish methane emitted in flatulence, belches, and manure. | Environment", "authors": ["Thomas D.
