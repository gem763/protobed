Is It Time to Level the Playing Field?", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWe don\u2019t feel like we are coddling these students; we feel like we are trying to put them on an even playing field,\u201d said Peter Weber, executive director of the Oregon School Activities Association, which oversees high school athletics. \u201cWe need to match kids up with competition that is safe for them so they can walk out on a field and be competitive.\u201d\n\nBut others, including many coaches, say the change adds new barriers for impoverished students, and suggests they are too weak or too poor to compete against richer rivals. Why, they ask, should students\u2019 athletic potential be limited by their parents\u2019 bank accounts? And some opponents say tinkering with longstanding athletic matchups in an attempt to even the odds is a way of babying young people \u2014 a \u201cmedals for everyone\u201d mentality that undermines lessons in resilience and grit.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re out there making do with what they have, and that\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d said Gabe Murray, 19, a former Hoover football player.\n\nTom Farrey, executive director of the Aspen Institute\u2019s Sports & Society Program, said the sports achievement disparity between wealthy suburban public schools and their urban counterparts has degenerated into \u201ca competitive gap that is similar to the income gap\u201d in the nation.\n\n\u201cThe divide has always been there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it has widened.\u201d\n\nThe disparity, experts say, is meaningful beyond the world of athletics because sports participation has been found to aid in academic success and college admissions, and is a predictor for professional success.\n\nThe discussion comes at a critical juncture for youth sports, where participation rates for many activities \u2014 particularly football \u2014 are in decline because of fears about brain injury and because children\u2019s interests more than ever fall outside engagement in traditional sports, according to studies.", "description": "A growing number of states are considering whether economic status should help determine which opponents schools play.", "authors": ["Timothy Williams"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/us/00sports-team/merlin_160431543_6eea8d08-9539-4fe4-9376-6184131c32ce-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
