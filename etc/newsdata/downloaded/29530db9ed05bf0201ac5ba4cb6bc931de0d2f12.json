I missed all of the French game. Terrible service. pic.twitter.com/w2V9cg2I64\n\nBlair Mirfin is a farmer in the remote Grey Valley on the South Island\u2019s west coast. The local rugby coach said people were jittery about how they would follow the tournament.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out in the blooming back blocks here and internet reception is terrible, you\u2019re lucky to get the odd pocket here and there,\u201d said Mirfin.\n\nNew Zealand stand firm against South Africa in heavyweight thriller Read more\n\n\u201cIt should absolutely be on free-to-air channels \u2013 it\u2019s the country\u2019s national sport. The government should be sticking some money into letting us watch rugby. I am sure it is bringing in a lot of money through tourists and what not.\u201d\n\nAccording to Spark, the first game of the cup \u201cworked well\u201d, despite fans angrily attesting to the contrary.\n\n'It\u2019s in the DNA': New Zealand feels strain ahead of All Blacks opener in Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nThe company has refused to release figures of how many issues were recorded on the first night of the tournament, but said more than 40,000 viewers were able to tune in.\n\nPaul Harper (@pauljmharper) Spark Sport stream in the pub froze just as Argentina was lining up that late penalty kick. #FRAvARG\n\nThe justice minister, Andrew Little, had said rural New Zealanders deserved to watch the World Cup, and had pushed though a bill allowing licensed premises to remain open for the duration of the tournament in Japan \u2013 giving rugby fans the choice of heading to the pub if their home viewing parties failed.\n\nFor many, however, Mirfin says, heading into pubs and hotels is unpractical and expensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty annoyed about it, with what farmers do, we\u2019re on a tight schedule; we can\u2019t just drop everything and go to the pub even if its going to be on there. It\u2019s a pretty awkward situation all around.\u201d\n\nMike Connors, the CEO of the West Coast Rugby Union Club, said many people did not like going to pubs to watch games as alcohol could make things rowdy and the sound and quality of the experience often was not up to scratch.\n\n\u201cMost of New Zealand is a pretty rural farming country, so this is a pretty strange decision,\u201d Connors said. \u201cSome people just won\u2019t be able to watch, there are no contingencies in place.\n\n\u201cIf you live 150km from a town, are you going to drive in to watch it? Personally I don\u2019t even like the atmosphere at bars. A lot of people are the same.\u201d\n\nTV and audiovisual experts nationwide have also reported a boom in business as they guide people through installing the tricky technology.\n\nAs the All Blacks ran out to meet the Springboks on Saturday, delays and freezing interrupted the lead-up.\n\nFor some viewers, the live stream froze for more than 20 seconds and only went live again as George Bridge of the All Blacks scored the first try of the match.\n\nEarlier in the evening, more than 88,000 New Zealanders had tuned in to watch the Fiji vs Australia match, with over 10% reporting problems.\n\nA spokesperson for Spark told the Guardian there had been \u201cno issues reported\u201d in the lead-up to the All Blacks\u2019 kick-off on Saturday, despite evidence of numerous live complaints to the company on social media, and reports of issues with games and pre-game commentary, freezing, displaying error messages and flicking to black.\n\n\u201cIn terms of performance of our platform, we have no issues from our end,\u201d a Spark spokesperson said. \u201cOur customer care teams are working with customers who are experiencing user-related or device issues on an individual basis.\u201d", "description": "New streaming service receives thousands of complaints as All Blacks kick off campaign", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/364eb1bd0bde0b0a7b92d7b04d91b8db6990cb35/57_561_3780_2269/master/3780.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2bdb64fffd072553908349cb4a60d730", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
