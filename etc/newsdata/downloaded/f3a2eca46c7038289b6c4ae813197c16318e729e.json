He said less than 0.16 percent of all claims from the company result in balance bills.\n\nSome experts note that even just the threat of sending large surprise bills to patients, though, can provide leverage for doctors to win higher payment rates from insurers.\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee asked for a range of data on the company\u2019s revenues from out-of-network billing and other information, which the letter from Berman does not appear to provide.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA committee official dismissed the letter from Blackstone. \u201cIt\u2019s not an actual response, it\u2019s a PR document,\u201d the person said. \u201cThe Chairman and Ranking Member expect full compliance with the Committee\u2019s oversight requests and they will be following up.\u201d\n\nBerman denounced the approach that the Energy and Commerce Committee is using in its legislation to solve the problem. That bill, as well as one from the Senate Health Committee, would essentially set the payment rate that insurers pay doctors after the patient is protected, based on the median payment rate that insurers have already negotiated in that geographic area.\n\nDoctors groups argue this approach gives too much power to insurers and would lead to damaging cuts to their payment rates.\n\n\u201cThis effort by insurers to maximize profits at the expense of doctors and patients endangers those who rely on TeamHealth for critical care,\u201d Berman wrote. \u201cIn rural America, which already faces serious access challenges, insurers' actions could effectively shutter the only hospitals or medical practices available in those communities.\u201d\n\nBerman instead proposed an alternative solution, backed by many doctors groups, that would allow an outside arbiter to help set the payment rate.\n\nBackers of the Energy and Commerce and Senate Health Committee bills have criticized this approach as preserving artificially high payment rates for doctors, which could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums.\n\nLast month, The Hill obtained internal polling from President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP congressman slams Trump over report that U.S. bombed former anti-ISIS coalition headquarters US to restore 'targeted assistance' to Central American countries after migration deal Trump says lawmakers should censure Schiff MORE\u2019s campaign pollster warning that swing-state voters oppose the bipartisan legislation meant to protect patients from surprise medical bills they receive when going out-of-network for emergency care\n\nThe survey of voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania conducted by Tony Fabrizio, the president\u2019s campaign pollster, found that a majority of voters in three battleground states believe that health insurers should be on the hook when patients receive surprise medical bills for out-of-network emergencies.\n\nTrump has advocated fixing the problem of surprise medical bills, but has not weighed in on the specific approach to use.", "description": "A top executive from a private equity firm under investigation by a House panel\u00a0in a dispute over how best to address\u00a0\u201csurprise\u201d medical bills defended the company\u2019s work.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/futureofhealthcare_medicaldata_062619hillillustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
