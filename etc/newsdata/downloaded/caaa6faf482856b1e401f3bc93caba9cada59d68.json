House speaker Nancy Pelosi threatening president trump with, quote, \"A whole new stage of investigation\" unless the administration turns over to congress that whistleblower's complaint. At the heart of that complaint, president trump's phone call with the leader of Ukraine. And for the first time today, the president appearing to acknowledge they did discuss former vice president Joe Biden. In the meantime tonight, there are calls for the president to release the transcript of that phone call. He says he's thinking about it. ABC's David Wright starts us off at the white house. Reporter: Tonight, house speaker Nancy Pelosi is setting a Thursday deadline for the trump administration to hand over a whistleblower complaint against the president for congressional review or else, she says, be prepared for \"A whole new stage of investigation.\" At issue is what exactly was said in a July phone call the president had with the leader of Ukraine.

Reporter: Today president trump didn't rule that out. We'll make a determination about how to release it, releasing it, saying what we said. The problem is when you ar#e speaking to foreign leaders you don't want foreign leaders to feel that they shouldn't be speaking openly. Reporter: But the trump administration has so far not released the whistleblower complaint. Even after the inspector general for the director of national intelligence determined the complaint was credible and of urgent concern. This weekend, former vice president Biden hit back at trump. Trump's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum. And he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me. David Wright joins us live from the white house. David, in that letter, Pelosi said she expects it to be turned ov by Thursday? Reporter: Yes, that's when the director of national intelligence, the acting director, is scheduled to appear at an open session.
