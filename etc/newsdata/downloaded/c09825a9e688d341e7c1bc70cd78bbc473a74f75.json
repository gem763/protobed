View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) This Sunday, President Donald Trump and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are sharing a stage in my hometown of Houston, Texas, at an event named \"Howdy, Modi\". This is Modi's first trip to the US since his reelection earlier this year, and it comes at a time when he and Trump are looking to forge stronger ties and trade relations between the US and India.\n\nWhile tens of thousands of Indian Americans are expected to welcome the prime minister inside the NRG stadium alongside local officials, members of Congress, and other politicians, I'll be outside protesting with many others as we bid adios to Modi.\n\nIt's shameful to see the prime minister being enthusiastically welcomed in the city I know and love under the guise of multiculturalism and inclusion -- especially when Modi has stoked Hindu nationalist sentiments since he was first elected in 2014.\n\nI'm a third-generation Indian American raised in Houston's Indian Christian community. My ammachis, or my grandmothers, immigrated to Texas from Kerala, India, in search of nursing jobs in the 1970s and established their lives in this city alongside other Indian immigrant families.\n\nThe South Asian community in Texas is a multi-religious and multi-racial community. We are queer, trans, and gender non-conforming. We are undocumented and working-class people. We trace our families back to different countries in South Asia, as well as to Africa and the Caribbean. And we are part of the reason that Houston is known to be one of the most diverse cities in America", "description": "This Sunday, President Donald Trump and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are sharing a stage in my hometown of Houston, Texas, at an event named \"Howdy, Modi\".
