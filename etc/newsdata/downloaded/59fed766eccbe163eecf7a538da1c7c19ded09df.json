Not only were the opponents angry at each other, they were openly racist haters of America. They showed hatred for most of our values, such as hard work and taking responsibility for one\u2019s own life and the state of the nation.\n\nThe candidates viciously attacked each other, not with sane remarks about the content of what each one said, but with comments about each other. Straw man attacks seemed to be all the argument they had. They jumped on fellow candidate Andrew Yang for \u201cbuying votes through openly giving money to voters, but they then denied that promising to pay off debt that people freely chose to take on (or paying for some other lifestyle choice) constituted buying votes. I assure you, it is no different.\n\nLastly, none of the candidates had a plan for fixing the crisis of humans breaking the Commandment \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d Instead, these presidential hopefuls only know how to take guns from law-abiding citizens. With the recent number of knife attacks, will they soon try to make knives illegal, too.\n\nMICHAEL T.
