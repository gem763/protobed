I can't wait to show what us girls can do on the world's biggest stage.\"\n\n\"I'm so honored to be taking on one of the world's biggest stages in the company of a fellow female artist to represent Latinos and Latinas from the U.S. and all over the world -- and to top it off, on my birthday!\" added Shakira in a statement of her own. \"This is a true American dream and we are going to bring the show of a lifetime!\"\n\nThough both stars have worked steadily for decades, neither has performed at the Super Bowl. This also marks one of the first times the halftime show has been headlined by two Latin artists; according to Pew Research Center the Miami metro area is home to the third-largest Hispanic population in the United States.\n\nEarlier this year, Maroon 5 headlined the halftime show, and Travis Scott and Big Boi also performed. In 2018, the honor fell to Justin Timberlake.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
