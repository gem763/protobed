Some relatives of the former Democratic vice president \u2013 and possible 2020 Democratic presidential contender \u2013 voted for Republican Donald J. Trump.\n\nJOE BIDEN'S BROTHER SAYS FAMILY MEMBERS VOTED FOR TRUMP, 'FELT SLIGHTINGD' BY CLINTON: REPORT\n\nJoe Biden represented Delaware in the Senate but is originally from Pennsylvania. According to his brother, the former vice president\u2019s Pennsylvania family \u201cfelt slighted\u201d by Hillary Clinton.\n\nThey weren\u2019t alone. The election of Donald Trump marked the first time Pennsylvania voted Republican in a presidential race since 1988, when George H.W. Bush won the state to defeat then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.\n\nHaving grown up in Pennsylvania I can vouch for how its people are honest, hardworking, salt-of-the-earth straight shooters.\n\nThey don\u2019t take kindly to arrogant politicians who think they\u2019re better than them and singlehandedly insult and stereotype blocs of voters. Much like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 when she called Trump supporters a \u201cbasketful of Deplorables.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been over two years since the 2016 election and the Democratic Party still won\u2019t read the memo. It\u2019s as if candidates and potential candidates are competing with each other to see who can be the most extreme.\n\nEven Frank Biden thought Hillary\u2019s \u201cDeplorables\u201d comment was, well, pretty deplorable. \u201cThe idea of declaring a whole swath of people \u2018Deplorables\u2019 is just the most idiotic political calculation. \u2026 Talk about lacking humility,\u201d Frank Biden said. Ouch.\n\nThat arrogance doesn\u2019t play well in Pennsylvania, and it doesn\u2019t work in most flyover states \u2013 like Michigan and Wisconsin, which Clinton did in fact fly right over in her 2016 campaign. The good people of Michigan and Wisconsin returned the favor on Election Day when they ignored her and threw their historically blue states to Trump.\n\nThe miscalculation of 2016 is one that\u2019s yet to be corrected by the Democrats. They never bothered to answer the question posed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s post-election book: \u201cWhat Happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead, Democrats have chartered a course and it\u2019s full speed ahead, rebranding themselves as the party of far-left radicalism.\n\nFrank Biden is not alone when he says: \u201cMy personal politics are not as far left as many of the candidates seem to be.\u201d\n\nAll that doesn\u2019t matter. It appears Democrats are digging in their heels and choosing to ignore what\u2019s not working for them where real people live and vote.\n\nSome Democrats are taking their radical agenda to the extreme and proposing things like a 70 percent income tax rate on the wealthiest Americans. Does anyone really believe our historically greedy government will stop there? Eventually that 70 percent rate will trickle down to the middle class.\n\nMany Democrats are also pushing proposals such as single-payer health care. Not only would this handicap Americans with enormous tax increases, but it would put the quality of our health care in the hands of our government.\n\nCountries with socialized medicine are infamous for their rationing of health care and interminable waiting lists \u2013 sometimes for the simplest of tests and procedures.\n\nIn a crowded field of potential 2020 presidential hopefuls, not a single one emerged to denounce the proposed astronomical 70 percent tax rate, nor did a single leader of the Democratic Party \u2013 including former President Obama. Does that sound out of the mainstream to anyone else?\n\nLast week Obama, who\u2019s made it his mission to raise up a new generation of leaders, called for \u201cnew blood\u201d in politics.\n\nLook at the radical Democrats in the freshman class in the House. This is an example of the \u201cnew blood\u201d he\u2019s talking about. This is the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nSo far Obama has met with several potential 2020 presidential candidates \u2013 most notably with defeated U.S. Senate candidate from Texas Beto O\u2019Rourke, who Obama reportedly considers to be most like himself.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is an extreme liberal who\u2019s quickly becoming a media darling. If all goes well when Oprah interviews him next month the media will likely crown him their candidate and roll out the red carpet for him from now until 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s been over two years since the 2016 election and the Democratic Party still won\u2019t read the memo. It\u2019s as if candidates and potential candidates are competing with each other to see who can be the most extreme.\n\nPeople in Middle America like Joe Biden\u2019s family in Pennsylvania didn\u2019t buy what the Democrats were selling in 2016, and they certainly don\u2019t subscribe to this new brand of radical extremism.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn spite of multiple signs and warnings, for better or worse, this is the future of the Democratic Party. Leading Democrats are going in one direction, but they haven\u2019t stopped to notice the rest of the country isn\u2019t following.\n\nIn 2020, the Democrats shouldn\u2019t be surprised if once again the Deplorables in flyover country pick up their baskets and walk the other way.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LAUREN DEBELLIS APPELL", "description": "The Democratic Party is moving so far to the extreme left that even some members of former Vice President Joe Biden's family voted for Donald Trump for president.", "authors": ["Lauren Debellis Appell", "Lauren Debellis Appell Is A Writer Based In Fairfax", "Virginia", "Writes Frequently For Foxnews.Com.
