(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe final 2.7-mile stretch of Beach Drive reopens in Northwest Washington this week, the culmination of a three-year reconstruction project that disrupted the travel of thousands of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nThe section of Beach Drive from the Maryland line to Joyce Road (just south of Military Road) that closed more than a year ago is set to reopen at noon Friday. It was the last phase of a complete rehabilitation of the 6\u00bd-mile thoroughfare that runs through Rock Creek Park.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to have the road reopened,\u201d park superintendent Julia Washburn said. \u201cThree years is a long time when you have to find new routes to work or to your favorite picnic area. We are very pleased that the public has been patient with us as we do this project.\u201d\n\nThe project, which started in September 2016, was the realization of a decade of planning to address deterioration visible though spreading gaps and widening cracks. But it also gave the city a taste of what it\u2019s like to have a full road closure for months at a time.\n\nDuring the work \u2014 which was done in phases \u2014 stretches of the route remained closed for months and pedestrians and cyclists had no access to picnic tables and portions of a multiuse path that connect to the city\u2019s growing trail system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s finally ending,\u201d said Ann Garlow, who lives in the area and used Beach Drive daily before the work began. The construction meant she had to find other routes, costing her more time.\n\n\u201cIt seems longer than three years only because you spend so much more time in traffic,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore this week, nearly four miles of the route had been rebuilt and reopened to traffic in the four-phase project.\n\n[Here\u2019s how D.C.-area residents get around town]\n\n\n\nA skateboarder passes along Beach Drive just north of Joyce Road in Rock Creek Park. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nBuilt in the late 1800s, Beach Drive provides north-and-south access to Rock Creek Park, the United States\u2019 first urban national park. It also is an important commuter route that carries traffic from Maryland and upper Northwest to downtown. The road carries more than 12 million vehicles a year, and about 40,000 people use it for recreation activities on the weekends.\n\nThe National Park Service, which owns the road and led the reconstruction project, says as the entire road opens it anticipates those users will come back.\n\n\u201cNo more cracks and potholes. It is all fixed and beautiful,\u201d Washburn said.\n\nBy the time work began in September 2016, Beach Drive\u2019s deterioration was so bad that temporary repairs, including filling potholes and patching cracks, were no longer cost-effective or efficient. A bike ride on the nearby trail was just as bumpy because of tree roots cracking the asphalt and weed overgrowth.\n\n\n\nLogan Harding, 23, of the District, dips his feet into the water along Beach Drive in Rock Creek Park. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nSomething had to be done, park officials said. The road\u2019s last complete reconstruction had been more than 25 years ago, which is how long officials say most roads last.\n\nSo, the road got a complete facelift. Crews excavated the entire area and put in a new gravel base before laying new asphalt. Six bridges were rehabilitated and parking areas rebuilt. New traffic safety features were added, includingguardrails and centerline rumble strips to keep drivers from drifting into oncoming traffic.\n\nAbout 300 new trees were planted, and 14 new bio-retention ponds were installed to reduce storm water runoff from Beach Drive and improve water quality in the park. In the final phase alone, work included the installation of 11,000 tons of asphalt and more than 10,000 linear feet of culvert, and the replacement of more than 29,000 linear feet of curbs and road gutters.\n\n\u201cWe did reconstruct the road from the ground up,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cIt was a pain point, but we got through it and the road is so much nicer now. It is a much more pleasant drive.\u201d\n\nThe new road is such an improvement that drivers have been caught speeding on the portions already open, prompting the Park Service to add more safety features. This summer, crews went back to two locations to install speed tables, markings and signs to get motorists to obey the 25-mph speed limit and slow down as they approach busy crosswalks near the National Zoo and popular trails.\n\nWashburn said the project stayed on budget \u2014 $32.9 million \u2014 and kept the historical nature and footprint of the road.\n\n[National Park Service tries \u2018speed calming\u2019 to slow drivers on newly rebuilt Beach Drive]\n\n\n\nBike-friendly storm grates have been installed along Beach Drive. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nGarlow, however, said she has noticed more wear and tear on the roads where traffic was detoured during the shutdown. She said she hopes investments are made in fixing them, too. Other big commuter routes such as 16th Street and Connecticut Avenue, which parallel the park, were said to handle the bulk of the spillover traffic during the closure, but some D.C. residents said neighborhood roads also suffered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough. Getting out of my neighborhood can take 20 minutes,\u201d Garlow said. \u201cA lot more traffic \u2014 and all day \u2014 because there is no other way.\u201d\n\nGarlow said she\u2019s looking forward to a quicker ride home.\n\n\u201cIt is going to make everything better. I hope so,\u201d she said. But in Washington, she said, the road work is never over.\n\nPark officials say after this full facelift, the road will get its regular annual maintenance.\n\n\u201cThat should mean that we won\u2019t have to go through this again for maybe 30 years or so,\u201d Washburn said.\n\nRead more:\n\nD.C. makes bus lanes on H and I streets permanent and extends their hours\n\n395 Express Lanes on track to open in November\n\nPlan for Long Bridge expansion moves forward", "description": "The opening of the final 2.7-mile stretch of the Northwest D.C. thoroughfare marks the end of a frustrating three years.", "authors": ["Luz Lazo", "Transportation Reporter Covering Washington'S Metro", "Buses", "Capital Bikeshare", "Taxis", "The Region'S Road Network", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HYzurm-UBzBjtML6OPALhR0qc84=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BZ5YEXG6IYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
