U.S. stock futures retreated, Hong Kong shares slumped and China\u2019s yuan dropped as investors took stock of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate cut and the odds for the People\u2019s Bank of China to lower borrowing costs. Equities were little changed in Shanghai.\n\nFailing to follow the Fed and European Central Bank in easing policy interest rates, the BOJ nonetheless flagged that it needs to pay more attention to the risk of lost momentum toward its inflation target. Officials aim to \u201creexamine\u201d growth and price developments next month.\n\nIn a mixed session, though, Japan\u2019s stocks were still higher midday. A late-session rebound in American stocks -- following comments from Chairman Jerome Powell that the Fed is \u201cprepared to be aggressive\u201d if growth faltered -- failed to follow through to S&P 500 futures Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no cohesive narrative\u201d at the moment, said Hannah Anderson, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE: ) Asset Management. The Fed rate cut and Powell briefing \u201cdoesn\u2019t really change the narrative that investors are going to need more than that from some governing body to give a central thesis that they feel comfortable sticking with for a while,\u201d she said.\n\nU.S.-China trade talks still loom, while the geopolitical situation in the Middle East remains unclear after Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for last Saturday\u2019s attack on its oil installations.\n\nStill to come Thursday are monetary policy decisions in Indonesia, Taiwan and the U.K. And BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda briefs on the policy decision.\n\nThese are some key events to keep an eye on this week:\n\nBank Indonesia and Bank of England decide policy Thursday.\n\nAustralia jobs figures are out Thursday.\n\nFriday is quadruple witching day for U.S. markets. When the quarterly expiration of futures and options on indexes and stocks occurs on the same day, surging volatility and trading can follow.\n\nHere are the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nFutures on the S&P 500 Index slid 0.3% as of 1:04 p.m. in Tokyo.\n\nJapan\u2019s index rose 0.8% after gaining as much as 1.2% earlier.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s fell 1.2%.\n\nThe was little changed.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi added 0.2%.\n\nAustralia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.4%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was flat after increasing 0.2% on Wednesday.\n\nThe yen rose 0.5% to 107.87 per dollar.\n\nThe fell 0.3% to 7.1026 per dollar.\n\nThe euro bought $1.1038.\n\nThe fell 0.5% to 67.91 U.S. cents.\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was at 1.79%.\n\nAustralia\u2019s 10-year bond yield slid about seven basis points to 1.06%.\n\nCommodities", "description": "Japan Stocks Pare Gains After BOJ; Aussie Slides: Markets Wrap", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picaace810227086183c5e3bdbd6a0aebe5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
