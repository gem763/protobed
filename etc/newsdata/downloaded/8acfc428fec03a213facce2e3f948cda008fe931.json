Bannon specifically pointed to the party\u2019s frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden: Trump 'an idiot' for saying Russian interference a 'hoax' Biden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE, as a weak candidate.\n\nThe reassuring message here for Trump\u2019s fans is that the current crop of Democrats is even less likely to defeat Trump than was Clinton.\n\nPolling shows that is false. But the president and his supporters dismiss polls even as they consistently show Biden beating Trump.\n\nInside the conservative bubble of fantasy politics, the game extends to generating fake social media support for fringe candidates for the Democratic nomination, including Marianne Williamson Marianne WilliamsonJuan Williams: Heed Clinton's warning on Tulsi Gabbard The Memo: What the leading 2020 Dems need to do 2020 Democrats commend US forces on ISIS leader's death MORE, Andrew Yang Andrew YangMichael Moore praises O'Rourke on gun reform DNC toughens qualification criteria for December debate The Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Presented by Better Medicare Alliance \u2014 Impeachment angst growing in GOP MORE and, most of all, Rep.

I mean, totally.\u201d\n\nInstead of responding to the real threat another third-party candidate poses to Democrats, Gabbard lashed out at Clinton as the \u201cqueen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nAmid all this, there was confusion over whether Clinton had meant that the people grooming Gabbard were Republicans or Russians. But the idea of Russian backing is hardly far-fetched.\n\nIn 2016, Russian trolls and bots promoted the third-party candidacy of Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate whose vote totals in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were big enough to argue she deprived Clinton of just enough support to hand victory to Trump.\n\nOf course, right-wing websites and radio shows ignored that reality while elevating the intramural fight among Democrats.\n\nSen.

Gabbard resigned as a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to endorse Sanders.\n\nGabbard, with her sympathy for the Assad regime in Syria, as well as her defense of WikiLeaks\u2019 decision to release e-mails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016 \u2014 reportedly hacked by the Russians \u2014 and willingness to attack fellow Democrats make her an ideal candidate for use by the Russians.\n\nTrump loyalists saw potential in Gabbard in 2016.\n\nBannon arranged for her to have a face-to-face meeting with Trump to have her considered for a post in the administration, possibly as Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump supporters promote her constantly.\n\n\u201cOn podcasts and online videos, in interviews and Twitter feeds, alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activist and some of the biggest boosters of Mr. Trump heap praise on Ms. Gabbard,\u201d The New York Times reported two weeks ago.\n\nThe paper explained that anti-Semites \u201cfawn\u201d over Gabbard, \u201cpraising her willingness to criticize Israel.\u201d\n\nAnd the story noted that earlier this year \u201cthe Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, took credit for Ms. Gabbard\u2019s qualification for the first two Democratic primary debates.\u201d\n\nMuch of the pro-Trump internet backing of Gabbard is due to \u201cthe Hawaiian congresswoman\u2019s isolationist foreign policy views. They like her support for drug decriminalization. They like what she sees as censorship by big technology platforms,\u201d according to the Times.\n\nGabbard has pledged that she will not be a third-party candidate.\n\nBut she plans to take whatever delegate support she wins in the primaries to the Democratic convention to pressure the nominee to hear her agenda for the party.\n\nThat means another possible split within the party with the telegenic Gabbard ready to diminish Democrats as captives of establishment politics \u2014 divided and out of touch with the base of the party.\n\nWhy would the Russians have an interest in her?\n\nJuan Williams is an author, and a political analyst for Fox News Channel.", "description": "OPINION: The Hawaii congresswoman\u2019s stances merit the kind of scrutiny they received from Hillary Clinton.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gabbardtulsi_10152019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
