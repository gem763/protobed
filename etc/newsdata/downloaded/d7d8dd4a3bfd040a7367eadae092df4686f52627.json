REUTERS/Vicki Behringer\n\nBy Alexandria Sage\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A former Peruvian first lady was dragged out of a courtroom in San Francisco on Thursday as she cursed a judge\u2019s decision to keep her husband, ex-president Alejandro Toledo, in jail pending extradition proceedings.\n\nToledo, 73, is wanted in Peru to stand trial over accusations that he took a $20 million bribe from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht during his 2001-2006 term.\n\nToledo denies wrongdoing. He was arrested in July and has sought release on $1 million bail.\n\nOdebrecht acknowledged in a 2016 leniency deal that it had bribed officials in a dozen Latin American countries, including Peru, to secure public works contracts. A former Odebrecht executive has said Toledo asked for a bribe and has been providing evidence to corroborate the claim.\n\nU.S. Federal Magistrate Judge Thomas Hixson ruled that Toledo was too much of a flight risk to free, citing what he described as connections to influential people in different countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given a lot of thought to this,\u201d Hixson told a courtroom packed with Toledo\u2019s supporters and Peruvian media. \u201cI\u2019m going to maintain the detention order in place.\u201d\n\nAfter the ruling was announced, Toledo\u2019s wife, Belgian-American anthropologist Eliane Karp shouted, \u201cWhat the fuck is this trial? It\u2019s a joke! It\u2019s a joke!\u201d\n\nU.S. Marshals dragged Karp, 65, from the courtroom as she resisted and shouted that her husband would die in jail.\n\nThe outburst was the latest drama in the far-reaching corruption scandal that has hit Peruvian politicians particularly hard. Earlier this year, another former president, Alan Garcia, killed himself to avoid arrest in the Odebrecht probe. Two other former presidents are under investigation, with one under house arrest.\n\nToledo has been considered a fugitive in Peru since 2017, when a Peruvian judge ordered him detained to keep him from fleeing or obstructing the probe. But Toledo was outside of the country at the time and refused to return.\n\nIt was unclear if Toledo will remain in solitary confinement, an arrangement made to separate him from the general prison population for safety reasons.\n\nDefense attorney Graham Archer argued Toledo was being kept in inhumane conditions.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nHixson said he was not happy with the situation but that he had to ensure Toledo would not flee.\n\nA prosecutor for the government said Toledo might yet be moved to \u201cmaximum separation\u201d in prison, in which he would be put in a shared facility with other at-risk prisoners.\n\nToledo rose to power railing against government abuse and corruption under his predecessor Alberto Fujimori, a right-wing authoritarian who is now in prison in Peru for human rights violations and graft.", "description": "A former Peruvian first lady was dragged out of a courtroom in San Francisco on Thursday as she cursed a judge's decision to keep her husband, ex-president Alejandro Toledo, in jail pending extradition proceedings.", "authors": ["Alexandria Sage", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429236707&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B26P", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
