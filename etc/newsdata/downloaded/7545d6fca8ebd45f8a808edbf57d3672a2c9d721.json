So I\u2019m going to live on the wild side,\u2019 he says, before hopping on a yellow Ford Thunderbird.\n\n\u2018I feel like a kid in a candy store without the owner because you can do anything,\u2019 Cardenas said. He then opens another car\u2019s door which hits a pink Thunderbird.\n\n\u2018Nobody\u2019s looking. Hold on, zoom in. It\u2019s not dented, is it? There\u2019s no paint?\u2019 he asks the reporters off camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardenas was apparently not done violating the display cars, so he later jumps on a Ford SUV hybrid after the Ford representative said she may \u2018look the other way.\u2019\n\nShark ripped off woman's breast and both her hands as she swam with dolphins\n\n\u2018Oh my god,\u2019 the off-camera reporter shouts as Cardenas leaps onto the SUV, causing a the hood to buckle audibly.\n\n\u2018That didn\u2019t sound good,\u2019 Cardenas said.\n\n\u2018I would get off that now,\u2019 another reporter says. Cardenas then looks off camera and says, \u2018Oh no, he told me to get off.\u2019\n\nCardenas\u2019s last swan dive onto a car came at the end of the segment, when he entered a display for a newer Ford and leaped on the hood. (Picture: Good Morning Sacramento)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m going to get in trouble. Back to you guys,\u2019 he concludes, rightly assuming that he would in fact get in trouble for leaping on privately owned and considerably expensive cars.\n\nThe two reporters in the studio are both seen with their heads in their hands in apparent disbelief before quickly changing the topic to Ford\u2019s new line of 2020 models.\n\nRepresentatives from the International Auto Show later reached out to KMAX TV about the creditworthy segment. It was later announced that he was fired.\n\nThe Sacramento International Auto Show wrote on Facebook: \u2018After the Producer of the Sacramento International Auto Show reached out to the General Manager of KMAX TV regarding yesterday\u2019s astonishingly awful incident, she received a call this morning from the GM that the reporter from the Good Day Sacramento segment has been terminated immediately and the station expressed their sincerest apologies for the incident.\u2019", "description": "Angel Cardenas was fired for a segment at the Sacramento International Auto Sow the for the CBS morning show 'Good Day Sacramento.'", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91281318_1571776930.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
