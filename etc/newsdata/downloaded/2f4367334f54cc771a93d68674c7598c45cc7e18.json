Sign up here.\n\nFutures traders are still leaning toward another quarter-point of easing from the Federal Reserve this year, though their confidence has wobbled.\n\nAs the Fed delivered its second rate cut in a row Wednesday, contracts remained priced for another reduction by-year end. That expectation was only slightly shaken as Chairman Jerome Powell discussed the resilience of the U.S. economy, and policy makers\u2019 projections showed that most envisage no cuts this year or next.\n\nTraders may be focusing instead on the increasingly polarized views on the Fed. The three dissents to the Fed\u2019s decision included two who wanted no move, and one call for a deeper cut.\n\nThe January 2020 fed funds futures contract was at 1.65% late in New York trading -- still mostly priced for a third quarter-point cut this year -- up from 1.64% just before the Fed statement. That means traders expect another move from either of the Fed\u2019s two remaining meetings this year -- on Oct. 30 and Dec. 11.\n\n\u201cWe believe there\u2019s at least one more cut coming this year,\u201d said Bob Gahagan, portfolio manager at American Century Investments. \u201cThe manufacturing sector is impaired, and it\u2019s pretty much baked into the cake given the duration of the trade wars.\u201d\n\nThe market\u2019s pricing is a little more challenging to interpret than usual, given the recent upheaval in funding markets. The calculation that almost one more cut is factored in for this year assumes that the effective funds rate moves toward the middle of the Fed\u2019s new target range of 1.75% to 2%. The effective funds rate rose above the previous range of 2%-2.25% as of Tuesday, at 2.30%.\n\nThat market pricing for further Fed easing may also include further adjustments to the interest rate on excess reserves, which the Fed also lowered Wednesday, by 30 basis points.\n\n(Updates futures pricing.)\n\n--With assistance from Edward Bolingbroke.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Emily Barrett in New York at ebarrett25@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Mark Tannenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0Futures traders are still leaning toward another quarter-point of easing from the Federal Reserve this year, though their confidence has wobbled.As the Fed delivered its second rate cut in", "authors": ["Emily Barrett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mcCVJAhOkeap78qzxOXepw--~B/aD04MjA7dz0xNjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/2df3a02e0f7b55c71c6a8643e809ba2c", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
