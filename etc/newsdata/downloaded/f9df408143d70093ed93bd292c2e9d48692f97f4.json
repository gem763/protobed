He said police searched more than 200 addresses in 41 cities across Russia.\n\nThe charismatic anti-corruption campaigner instructed supporters to vote strategically to block pro-Kremlin candidates in Moscow's local election.\n\nAllies of President Vladimir Putin suffered major losses in the Russian capital during the September vote.\n\nNavalny organised the protests after popular opposition politicians were barred from standing in the Moscow parliament election.\n\n\"Shameless bastards from the Kremlin are seeking revenge for 'Smart Voting' and trying to destroy a network of our offices,\" Lyubov Sobol, one of the Navalny allies barred from the vote, said Tuesday on Twitter.", "description": "Opposition leaders denounce move as attempts to intimidate them after summer of protests against Kremlin.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/1d1b8fd386da453cb5766cbe7d4a172f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
