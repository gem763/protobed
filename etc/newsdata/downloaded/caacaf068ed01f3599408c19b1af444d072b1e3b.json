But, in the end, that wasn\u2019t enough to win Democratic voters \u2013 never mind general-election voters.\n\nOn August 28, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand ended her presidential bid after failing to qualify for the next Democratic presidential candidate debate, scheduled for September 12.\n\n\u201cI wanted you to hear from me first, that after more than eight incredible months, I am ending my presidential campaign,\u201d she announced to her supporters in a video posted on social media.\n\nWhile the other Democratic candidates pinpointed abortion as a major 2020 issue, Gillibrand made it her campaign\u2019s foundation.\n\nThe senator \u201centered the race pitching herself as the voice of feminism and the defender of families and women\u2019s equality,\u201d New York Times\u2019 political reporter Shane Goldmacher recognized on August 29. That\u2019s because Gillibrand \u201cchampioned a new \u2018Family Bill of Rights,\u2019 pioneered a new litmus test to select only judges who supported Roe v. Wade and traveled to Republican-controlled states to protest new restrictions on abortion.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Goldmacher added, \u201cof the six female candidates, she was the first to call it quits.\u201d\n\nOn Gillibrand\u2019s campaign website, her first priority listed is \u201cfighting for women and families.\u201d And the first way she planned to do that was by stressing, \u201cWe need to protect women\u2019s rights and access to the health care they need.\u201d In other words, abortion.\n\nAccording to her site, Gillibrand argued that \u201cReproductive rights are civil rights\u201d while expressing support for Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\n\u201cKirsten has pledged to only nominate judges who will commit to upholding Roe, and she was the first candidate to put out a comprehensive reproductive rights agenda,\u201d the site continued.\n\nIf elected president, Gillibrand promised not only to \u201ccodify Roe into law,\u201d but also to end the Hyde Amendment, which generally bars federal funding for abortion. She also vowed to \u201cprotect Title X funding and Planned Parenthood.\u201d This was a new fight: the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider refused millions in Title X federal family-planning funding in August after new regulations prohibited the funding from going toward organizations connected to abortion.\n\nLast, but not least, her site reads, Gillibrand would \u201cguarantee access to reproductive health care?\u2014?including abortion?\u2014nationwide.\u201d\n\nIn her fight, Gillibrand saw the pro-life movement as the enemy. In early June, she made headlines after going so far as to liken abortion opposition to racism.\n\nAt the same time, Gillibrand assumed all women were with her, at least in her language. Later that month, she won applause from many in the media after her performance in the first round of debates where she made lengthy comments about abortion \u2013 comments \u201cto America's women and to the men who love them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen's reproductive rights are under assault by President Trump and the Republican Party,\u201d she began on June 27, before criticizing states for trying to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nGillibrand also identified herself as the \u201cfiercest advocate for women's reproductive freedom for over a decade,\u201d even though, she later admitted, other women were energized. In other words, all American women \u201care on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur rights are under attack like never before by President Trump and the Republicans who want to repeal Roe v. Wade, which is why I went to the front lines in Georgia,\u201d she continued.\n\nAnd that she had.\n\nIn May, Gillibrand visited Georgia to protest the state\u2019s new abortion restrictions, and repeated her promise to nominate Supreme Court justices who backed Roe v. Wade. For her efforts, media recognized her as the \u201cfirst 2020 White House hopeful to say she\u2019d nominate only Supreme Court justices who consider the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion settled law.\u201d Three months later, on August 18, she traveled to St. Louis to criticize to Missouri\u2019s new abortion ban too.\n\nShe also proved herself an ally to Planned Parenthood.\n\nWhen Planned Parenthood refused millions in Title X funding rather than stop performing or referring abortions, Gillibrand accused the Trump administration of \u201ctrying to hold health care providers hostage.\u201d\n\nOf the Democratic candidates, Gillibrand has by far received the most money from Planned Parenthood while serving as a federal candidate. According to Center for Responsive Politics data, the senator has gotten more than $50,000 from Planned Parenthood since 2006.\n\nShe had support \u2013 just not enough.\n\nThe reason \u201cwhy her candidacy never picked up steam was always a little bit of a mystery,\u201d according to FiveThirtyEight writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux.\n\nThomson-DeVeaux suggested that Gillibrand \u201cwas running against a number of other women who are also strong on issues like abortion rights and equal pay\u201d and \u201cWithout another signature issue to help her stand out, she often got lost in the melee of the primary.\u201d\n\nSupporting unrestricted abortion, in other words, isn\u2019t enough for Democratic voters. And it\u2019s certainly not enough for American voters in general, the majority of whom want restrictions on abortion.", "description": "Kirsten Gillibrand was applauded by many in the media as .09/02/2019 3:05:23AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/226/6cd0dc74-c025-497d-9d25-0ad1c5c521d7.png"}
