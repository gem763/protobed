This might not happen until 2025, but it is potentially part of the new share trading paradigm.\n\nAs the armageddon-like implications of the blockchain/DLT technology have become more obvious, a range of market participants have turned to Canberra for help. Their primary concern is the potential for ASX to entrench its market power without sufficient regulatory oversight.\n\nA group calling itself the CHESS Replacement Stakeholder Group has been lobbying the office of the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, the office of the Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, the chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, James Patterson, and Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers.\n\nThe stakeholder group\u2019s founding members are the Australian Investor Relations Association, Governance Institute of Australia, Australian Shareholders Association, Stockbrokers and Financial Advisers Association, Link Group, BoardRoom and Computershare.\n\nThe group wants the federal government to accelerate the implementation of legislation that would allow the Council of Financial Regulators to enforce \u201cappropriate parameters around the ASX\u2019s use of its monopoly powers\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, the group wants \u201ca parliamentary review to examine the scope, consultation and industry impacts of ASX\u2019s CHESS replacement program\u201d.\n\nIan Matheson, the chief executive of AIRA, and Governance Institute chief executive Megan Motto told Chanticleer they believed federal politicians had been \u201csucked in\u201d by ASX\u2019s presentations about its contribution to capital raising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ASX continues with a charade of consultation on CHESS but it\u2019s them talking to the stakeholders with no acknowledgement of our concerns over a long period of time,\u201d Matheson said.\n\n\u201cThere is no enforcement powers in the hand of regulators to stop the ASX from abusing its market power at some time in the future,\u201d Motto said.\n\nDisruptive power\n\nStevens told Chanticleer he was in Canberra last week with the ASX board of directors to provide a regular update on the CHESS replacement for federal government ministers, senior public servants and members of the opposition.\n\nHis presentation did not back away from the disruptive power of the DLT/blockchain functionality of the new system. It said about $22.4 billion in costs associated with administering the superannuation system could be slashed by removing legacy systems and building innovative services.\n\nStevens\u2019 three punchlines in his presentation to the politicians were as follows: some may not like information to be more freely available; some currently benefit from fragmented, siloed and inconsistent sources of truth; and some currently benefit from information delays allowing money to sit idle.\n\nStevens said the five main complaints made by the stakeholder group included many untruths.\n\nFirst, he said the federal government has opened up clearing and settlement to competition and it is possible a competitor will emerge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, he said it was not true that consultation had been \u201cfragmented and ineffective\u201d. He said there had been 17 ASX business committee meetings, 26 technical committee meetings, 20 webinars, five monthly newsletters, 35 industry working groups, 7549 emails sent responding to questions, 455 pages of technical documentation published, three out of seven software releases delivered to market and monthly meetings with the securities regulator, the central bank, the competition regulator and Treasury.\n\n\u201cThis is a company that is actually investing and actually creating jobs and believes in technology, believes in the future, and believes that's a good thing for the country,\u201d he said.\n\nStevens believes the critics are turning the DLT/blockchain element of the CHESS replacement into some sort of \u201cvoodoo\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually updating software, updating hardware, updating security, updating functionality, updating messaging and also saying to the industry, we're not going to take more data,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe're not going to charge you any more money. We're going to pay for the capital expenditure. It would be remiss of us not to put it in a distributed ledger at the bottom, because if we're building a technology system for the next 20, 30 years, you may have made a massive mistake in five years when you look back and say we haven\u2019t done this.\u201d\n\nChanticleer understands the government has privately indicated to industry that it supports the ASX blockchain replacement for CHESS on the basis that if the ASX gets it right, not only will it be good for the ASX, it will be good for Australia.", "description": "As the ASX moves towards the pointy end of replacing Australia\u2019s equity clearing and settlement system it is suddenly dawning on a range of market participants that their businesses could disappear.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8319%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_47%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b2be24363fa2427f214ef9636b03a4697b1efe31", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
