However, a hidden bearish signal just appeared on Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart, and it could indicate that bears may finally win the battle for the short term.\n\nHidden RSI Bearish Divergence on Bitcoin Price Daily Chart\n\nCrypto analysts and Bitcoin traders often perform detailed technical analysis in order to help them spot trend changes, or predict future price movements. In addition to drawing lines and shapes on charts, these analysts often couple that with the addition of helpful indicators and oscillators that further assist in determining a trading strategy.\n\nRelated Reading | Crypto Analyst: Bitcoin Indicator Resembles Mid-2016 Bullish Beginnings\n\nOne of the more popular indicators, especially for Bitcoin, the relative strength index, is giving off a \u201chidden\u201d bearish signal called a hidden bearish divergence, that could suggest that further downside movement should be expected in the coming days.\n\nHidden bearish divergences occur when the relative strength index achieves a new high, while price fails to do so. This suggests that the price movement didn\u2019t properly reflect the buying pressure indicated by the RSI, and that bears are gaining control over the price action.\n\nRSI divergences are among crypto analyst\u2019s most popular tools in determining potential trend changes and can be used to predict tops and bottoms. Most traders do not recommend taking positions due to hidden divergences but say investors should keep them in mind when looking at the overall analysis and price action before acting on the signal.\n\nBearish Downside Targets for BTC/USD Pair\n\nCrypto analysts are torn on what the multi-month pattern Bitcoin price has been trading inside. Some say it is a bull flag, symmetrical triangle, or even a descending triangle \u2013 and each suggests a different breakout scenario.\n\nIf the RSI hidden bearish divergence does play out, Bitcoin price is expected to finally break down from the multi-month structure it has been in. Targets based on these structures would be somewhere around $7,000.\n\n$BTC update: daily is looking bearish now. Shorting it if we break 10.2K. Will be adding if we break 10.150 all the way down to 9874, 9751 and 9427. Heavy resistance between 10.5 and 10.6K.
