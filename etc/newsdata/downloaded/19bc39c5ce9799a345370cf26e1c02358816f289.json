Customers can get quotations on long-term car rental contracts at Mercedes-Benz showrooms across the country, and they are also available to do the same but in less time through online services.MBMK could later follow the footsteps of Daimler Mobility AG, which has been making investments in mobility service companies like Free Now, Share Now and Blacklane. Free Now, a joint venture between BMW Group and Daimler Group, provides taxi rides for passengers from more than 100 cities in Europe with its mobile application, and Share Now uses its mobile application to provide rental cars for users in a short time period. Blacklane allows travelers to book chauffeurs and airport concierges at more than 600 airports around the world.According to market tracker Mordor Intelligence, the global managed mobility service market is expected to grow 31.4 percent on average every year from $5.2 billion last year to $26.45 billion by 2024.BY KO JUN-TAE [ko.juntae@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
