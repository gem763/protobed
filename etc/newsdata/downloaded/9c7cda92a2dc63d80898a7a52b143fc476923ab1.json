According to the Peoria Journal Star, Minger said the juvenile faces five counts of first-degree murder, two counts of arson and one count of aggravated arson \u2014 which implies that the child was aware people were in the home when he or she started the fire.\n\nMinger and the State\u2019s Attorney office did not respond to multiple request for comment from TIME.\n\nMinger told the Peoria Journal Star that the child will be appointed an attorney and have a bench trial in front of a judge. If convicted, the child faces a maximum of five years probation, but not past the age of 21, according to the AP. Minger also told the AP the child will not face jail time but will likely go through counseling and therapy.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But I just think it needs to be done at this point, for finality.\u201d\n\nWoodford County coroner Tim Ruestman confirmed to TIME that the five victims of the house fire included Kathryn Murray, 69; Jason Wall, 34; Rose Alwood, 2; Daemeon Wall, 2; and Ariel Wall, 1. Ruestman says all the victims died as a result of smoke inhalation and their deaths were all ruled homicides. Ruestman tells TIME investigations by the Woodford County Coroner\u2019s Office determined the fire was started intentionally.\n\nBetsy Clarke, founder and President of the Illinois-based Juvenile Justice Initiative, tells TIME that the prosecutors\u2019 decision to charge the 9-year-old in the first place is \u201cshocking,\u201d considering research that suggests kids at that age are not aware of the seriousness of their actions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shocking decision on the part of the prosecutors and it\u2019s out of step with the fundamental international human rights protections for children,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly shocking about it is the charges filed the same week that the first-ever global study on the deprivation of liberty of children was released. I was just at the launch of that study, and the key recommendation in the study is that the minimum age of prosecution be 14 \u2014 and the reason for 14 is that all of their brain research shows that children are not capable of understanding, appreciating consequences. Neurological studies show that they should not be criminally responsible at a lower age than 14, so 9 is simply shocking.\u201d\n\nDr. Jeff Temple, professor and psychologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch and a board member of the Texas Psychological Association says that young children do not understand that there are tangible consequences for their actions.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly enough that we know about the developing mind in psychology to say that a 9-year-old can not be responsible for an illegal offense for purposeful murder or intentional kills,\u201d Temple says. \u201cAt that age, the mind is not developed enough \u2014 they\u2019re not thinking of consequences, they\u2019re impulsive basically, they\u2019re watching cartoons where the Road Runner runs off the cliff, falls 500 feet, dies and is alive in the next scene so they don\u2019t have a good sense of life or death.\u201d\n\nTemple adds that he believes that the 9-year-old who allegedly started the blaze may have done so on purpose \u2014 even knowing people could get hurt \u2014 but still not understand the \u201cpermanence\u201d of death.\n\n\u201cKids do stupid things all the time and don\u2019t really think about the consequences,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could have been, as terrible as this was, that he wanted to see what it was like to see something burn down \u2014 even if he knew someone was in it. My guess is he doesn\u2019t understand the nature of consequence and actions, even if he thought someone was going to burn, he probably didn\u2019t have that sense of permanence that they weren\u2019t going to come back and that they were going to be dead and gone forever.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think we can hold someone who still believes in the Easter bunny and accuse them of having the intent of murdering someone when they don\u2019t even know the meaning of what death really is,\u201d Temple adds.\n\nClarke notes that it\u2019s a particularly surprising decision to her because Illinois is the home of the first juvenile court, which was established in 1899. \u201cThe whole idea was to give children a second chance,\u201d she says. \u201cIllinois led the world in protection for children and now we\u2019re so far behind.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, 62 juveniles in the U.S. under the age of 15 were charged with murder and non-negligent manslaughter, up from 59 the previous year, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In September, an Orlando school resource officer made national headlines after arresting two 6-year-olds at an Orlando charter school, violating the department\u2019s policy for arresting people under the age of 12. On Sept. 23, Orlando Police Chief Orlando Rol\u00f3n announced that officer Dennis Turner had been fired, saying he was \u201csick to his stomach\u201d when he found out about the arrest.\n\nWrite to Gina Martinez at gina.martinez@time.com.", "description": "An Illinois child, 9, has been charged with 5 counts of murder following a fire.
