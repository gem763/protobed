Meghan talking about her biracial background\n\nOne of the biggest moments at the start of Harry and Meghan's tour was a speech Meghan gave to young girls in Nyanga, a township in Cape Town that is known as one of the most dangerous places in South Africa.\n\n\"While I\u2019m here as a member of the royal family, I stand here before you as a mother, a wife, a woman, as a woman of color and as your sister,\" she told the girls.\n\nMeghan, born to a white father and African American mother, reveals in the documentary how that line was added to her speech and talks about her hope that one day people can look past her race.\n\n2.

Harry's ongoing grief over Princess Diana's death\n\nThe happy moments of Harry with his son are countered with more somber clips of Harry's reflecting on the loss of his mom, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash in Paris that involved paparazzi.\n\nHarry describes her death as a \"wound that festers.\"\n\n\"I think [of] being part of this family, in this role, in this job every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash,\" he said. \"It takes me straight back, so in that respect it\u2019s the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.\"\n\nHarry spoke about his mom and the media's attention on his family today before it was announced publicly that he and Meghan have started legal action against several British tabloids.\n\n\"Everything that she went through and what happened to her is incredibly raw every single day and that\u2019s not me being paranoid that\u2019s just me not wanting a repeat of the past,\" Harry told Bradby. \"And if anybody else knew what I knew, be it a father, be it a husband, be it anyone, you\u2019d probably be doing exactly what I\u2019m doing as well.\"\n\n4. Meghan's real talk on motherhood\n\nMeghan garnered sympathy and praise on social media after she acknowledged her struggle both as a new mom and one under a constant spotlight.\n\n\"I would say, look any women especially when they\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re really vulnerable so that was made really challenging and when you have a newborn, you know, yeah, you know, and especially as a woman it\u2019s really, it\u2019s a lot,\" she said. \"So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or a newlywed it\u2019s um, yeah, well, I guess, and also thank you for asking because not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK.\"\n\nMeghan also opens up about how she \"had no idea\" the depth of the scrutiny she would face after becoming Harry's wife.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think anybody could understand that,\" she said. \"In all fairness I had no idea, which probably sounds difficult to understand and hear, but when I first met my now-husband my friends were really happy because I was so happy but my British friends said to me, \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great but you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life.\u2019\"\n\n\"And I very naively \u2013 I\u2019m American. We don\u2019t have that there \u2013 [said], \u2018What are you talking about? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019m not in any tabloids,'\" she added. \"I didn\u2019t get it. So it\u2019s been, yeah. It\u2019s been complicated.\"\n\n5. Harry's relationship with Prince William\n\nHarry addresses the rumors, fanned by British tabloids, of a rift between him and William, the only children of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.\n\n\"Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it's under, inevitably stuff happens,\" he said. \"But look we\u2019re brothers. We\u2019ll always be brothers.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and as I know he\u2019ll always be there for me,\" Harry added. \"We don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy but I love him dearly.\"\n\n\"The majority of the stuff is created out of nothing but as brothers it\u2019s just as I said, you have good days, you have bad days,\" he said.\n\nTune into \"Harry & Meghan: An African Journey,\" hosted by \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor Robin Roberts, on Wednesday, Oct. 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on the ABC Television Network.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/Harry-Meghan-AnAfricanJourney-ITN-ht-ls-191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
