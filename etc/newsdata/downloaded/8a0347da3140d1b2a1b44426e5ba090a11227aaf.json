At least some of them.\n\nAfter the tech giant released its three new iPhones on Thursday, some models have already sold out and customers need to wait for a few weeks for them or buy them from individual sellers at a markup.\n\nCustomers who went to Apple (AAPL) stores were told they need a reservation to purchase a new iPhone, and some colors were no longer immediately available. On Apple\u2019s official site, it takes two to three weeks for a new iPhone to ship. On e-commerce platforms like Alibaba\u2019s Tmall and JD.com, where most Chinese consumers who don\u2019t have access to an Apple store would go to order iPhones, the iPhone 11 Pro model in midnight green was out of stock by late Friday.\n\nThe two platforms also reported strong sales. Tmall says sales of iPhone 11 series within the first 12 hours exceeded sales on the launch day of new phones last year. JD.com also reported this year\u2019s first-day sales was double what it was last year.\n\nCustomers experience iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro at an Apple store on East Nanjing Road on September 20, 2019 in Shanghai, China.

Not every model was met with the same fanfare. The most popular models were the new colors\u2014 green and purple iPhone 11 and the midnight green iPhone 11 Pro\u2014according to sellers and online platforms.\n\nThe secondary market also spoke to the popularity of some of the phones as unauthorized sellers found opportunities to flip popular models. For the most sought-after iPhone 11 Pro in midnight green, they could add a premium of $100, according to price sheets reviewed by Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cIf we have inventory, we\u2019ll sell with a markup right now, especially the green one,\u201d said Clarence Chen, a smartphone seller based in Guangzhou. \u201cThe price changes every minute. It\u2019ll be like this until Apple has enough inventory.\u201d\n\nCustomers queue outside an Apple store to buy the latest iPhone models in Hangzhou in China's eastern Zhejiang province on September 20, 2019.

Earlier this year, CEO Tim Cook wrote a surprising letter to investors, admitting the lukewarm demand from its Chinese market has harmed Apple\u2019s bottom line. Apple has been slashing prices and promoting trade-in programs to help make iPhones more affordable for Chinese users.\n\nAnalysts say Apple has learned its lesson this time by pricing the lower-end iPhone 11 at 5499 yuan ($775), luring more people into the ecosystem. It could also help Apple to compete with Huawei, the local tech giant that dominates over one-third of the smartphone market in China. The eye-catching new colors have also attracted buyers.\n\n\u201cThe new colors can spur the desire from consumers,\u201d said Mo Jia, an analyst with research firm Canalys. He cautions that the release this year is not comparable with last year because all of the new models were dropped at the same time. \u201cWe need a bit more time to see the real performance of the new iPhones.\u201d\n\nKrystal Hu covers technology and China for Yahoo Finance.
