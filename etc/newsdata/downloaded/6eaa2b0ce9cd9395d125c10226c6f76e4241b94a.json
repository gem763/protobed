(Photo: Gary Landers)\n\nCINCINNATI \u2013 The Cincinnati City Council voted 7-1 on Wednesday to make it illegal to discriminate against people with natural hair.\n\nCincinnati is the second city in the country, after New York City, to pass such a law. At the state level, California and New York have this law and Kentucky is considering one.\n\nWomen turned out during Wednesday's public comment session to tell stories of the discrimination they faced based on how they wear their hair.\n\nThe ordinance's sponsor, Councilman Chris Seelbach, called it \"one more step along an important path toward leveling the playing field in the community.\"\n\nVice Mayor Christopher Smitherman, whose wife, Pamela, died earlier this year, said they had long talks about how he would care for their young daughter's hair.\n\n\"Now, as a single father, there is no activity we do not plan around her hair care,\" Smitherman said. \"What I want for her is that where she works, whatever she does, that she can wear her hair however she wants.\"\n\n'Your hair is your identity': Natural hair discrimination could soon be outlawed in Cincinnati\n\nCouncilman Wendell Young said there are many things that need extra layers of legal protection, pointing to voting and civil rights.\n\n\"I wish I would live long enough that there was no need to pass a rule or law ,\" Young said. \"But we're not there yet. This is a real issue for a lot of women. I am glad we're doing it.\"\n\nUnder the proposal, it would be against the law to discriminate against natural hair and natural hairstyles associated with race. If discrimination is found, a fine of $100 per day up to a total of $1,000 could be levied until the practice ends.\n\nSeelbach took exception to Republican Councilwoman Amy Murray's lone no vote.\n\nMurray said she believed protections for natural hair already fall under federal race discrimination law, which makes it unlawful to treat unfavorably or harass a person because of that person's race or color. Passing a city law would be redundant, she argued.\n\nSeelbach asked Cincinnati City Solicitor Paula Boggs Muething if that were true, to which Boggs Muething said that while somebody could make a claim based on hair texture and type, they would need proof. This law makes it easier to prove discrimination based on wearing natural hair.\n\nSeelbach then turned to Murray and said: \"With all due respect, this is extreme privilege and a slap in the face to African-American women, whose stories I have heard and are degrading and horrible.\"\n\nFormer Cincinnati City Councilwoman Alicia Reece spoke during public comment. She praised Seelbach for proposing the ordinance.\n\n\"This is a bold step,\" Reece said. \"It's also a change in time, where women of color are saying, 'Hey, we can wear our hair and honor culture and still be in the workplace.' It's always been a whisper, but now women are speaking up. We're not going to let anyone tell us how we can wear our hair.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/09/cincinnati-council-votes-ban-discrimination-based-natural-hair/3926284002/", "description": "Cincinnati is the second city in the country, after New York City, to pass a law making it illegal to discriminate against natural hair.", "authors": ["Sharon Coolidge", "Published P.M.
