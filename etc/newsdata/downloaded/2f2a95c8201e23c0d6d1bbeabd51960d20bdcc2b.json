They might get arrested but then, often, seem to have charges dismissed.\n\nBut not this time.\n\nAccording to the NY Daily News, David Campbell, 32, was originally charged with assault for strangulation, possession of a weapon, assault of a police officer, resisting arrest and loitering after attacking a 56 year old man outside of a \u201cNight for Freedom\u201d event in Manhattan thrown by Mike Cernovich on January 20, 2018.\n\nCampbell was one of about eighty Antifa people agitating outside the event.\n\nCops said the black-clad attacker punched and choked the man.\n\n\u201cI saw him hit the old man,\u201d said witness Ali Thomas, 24. \u201cOne hit. He swung hard. He hit him hard. The old man\u2019s head hit the curb.\u201d The 911 caller said initially that the 56-year-old was in cardiac arrest after the fight, according to fire officials. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, officials noted.\n\nThis past week, according to the New York Post, Campbell pled guilty to two counts of felony assault and will be sentenced to 18 months according to the District Attorney\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWhen Antifa attacked a 56-year-old man, silence from the press,\u201d Cernovich told The Post. \u201cNow that the criminal case is closed, I will also be taking legal action against Mr. Campbell and his confederates. It is time to find out who is funding Antifa,\u201d he said.\n\nMedia has often failed to cover Antifa violence or painted them with a favorable brush, buying completely the idea that they are \u201cfighting fascism\u201d while minimizing their violence and ignoring their radical philosophy.\n\nCNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, for example, has compared Antifa to the U.S. military storming the beaches at Normandy. While Cuomo has said he does not justify violence, he has claimed they have a \u201cgood cause,\u201d painting their violence as a bug rather than as a feature.\n\nHis colleague, Don Lemon, has also spoken favorably of Antifa, while saying that no one supports violence, has claimed they were fighting fascism and \u201cno organization is perfect.\u201d\n\nApart from coverage by local and conservative media, the plea doesn\u2019t appear to have gotten attention. A search didn\u2019t seem show any coverage by CNN of Campbell pleading guilty.", "description": "MSM Silent as Antifa Member Gets Justice for Attacking Man", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "Mike Ford", "Brandon Morse", "Sister Toldjah", "Sarah Lee", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Antifa-Berkeley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
