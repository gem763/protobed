But No 10 said it could not justify spending taxpayers\u2019 money to keep a struggling business afloat.\n\nAirline regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has chartered more than 40 aircraft to bring customers home from 18 countries, after Thomas Cook\u2019s own planes were grounded because of its collapse. The largest repatriation effort in peacetime history, dubbed Operation Matterhorn, is expected to incur costs of more than \u00a3100m, borne by the Department for Transport.\n\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, said authorising an emergency cash injection of \u00a3150m to stave off the company\u2019s collapse would have set a dangerous precedent. \u201cClearly, that\u2019s a lot of taxpayers\u2019 money and sets up [\u2026] a moral hazard in the case of future such commercial difficulties that companies face,\u201d he said.\n\nA No 10 spokeswoman added: \u201cA bailout would not have been a good use of taxpayers\u2019 money. We would have had to repatriate people later down the line and have lost more money in the process.\u201d\n\nBut Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said ideological bias was behind the decision. He told the BBC: \u201cThe government\u2019s intervention could have enabled us to just stabilise the situation, give a breathing space so that there could be proper consultation with the workforce in particular about how to go forward.\n\n\u201cTo just stand to one side and watch this number of jobs go and so many holidaymakers have their holiday ruined, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise government.\u201d\n\nThe first signs rescue talks had failed came on Sunday when executives left crunch talks with banks and shareholders without reaching a deal. The tour operator\u2019s lights had disappeared from price comparison websites such as Skyscanner within hours.\n\nThe last Thomas Cook flight, from Orlando to Manchester, touched down at 8.52am at Manchester airport on Monday morning. Its crew were said to have been in tears. By that time officials from the CAA had already arrived during the night to impound one of its planes.\n\nPassengers on one of the last official Thomas Cook flights, from Lanzarote to London Gatwick, praised the behaviour of cabin crew who knew their jobs were at risk.\n\nJoe Jeness, 34, said: \u201cAfter we touched down the crew were visibly upset. One of the air hostesses had tears in her eyes when we got off the plane and we saw others hugging each other. The captain came and stood at the exit with the crew and every passenger who got off the plane wished them well. It was heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest British passengers speak to Thomas Cook staff at Palma de Mallorca airport. Photograph: Francisco Ubilla/AP\n\nStaff at the company\u2019s Peterborough headquarters were formally notified on Monday morning. \u201cIt is a matter of profound regret to me and the rest of the board that we were not successful,\u201d said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser. \u201cThis marks a deeply sad day for the company.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s insolvency service is expected to fund redundancy payments for UK staff, although trade union sources said it was unclear if they would be paid next week and predicted taxpayers would end up funding \u00a350m in redundancy and compensation costs.\n\nThe fallout is already spreading far beyond the UK, with holiday resorts that rely heavily on British custom also bracing for hardship. On the island of Crete, where about 20,000 Thomas Cook customers were staying when it collapsed, officials likened the effect to an earthquake. Michalis Vlatakis, the head of Crete\u2019s tourist agencies\u2019 association, said hoteliers are expecting a \u201cfollowing tsunami\u201d in the form of cancelled bookings for months ahead.\n\nTunisia\u2019s government offered assurances holidaymakers won\u2019t be prevented from leaving the country, following reports tourists were held prisoner at a hotel by staff who feared they would not be paid.\n\nThe cost of repatriating Britons who were overseas when Thomas Cook failed is expected to exceed the \u00a360m spent on bringing people home after the failure of Monarch airline. Whitehall officials predict costs in excess of \u00a3100m.\n\nAfter Monarch\u2019s bankruptcy, the government pledged to overhaul airline insolvency rules, to protect passengers and the taxpayer from bearing the brunt of the cost in the event another airline went bust.\n\nA review published in March recommended laws be changed so a bankrupt airline could be put in special administration to fly its own customers home, rather than have its planes grounded.\n\nThe review also recommended a 50p levy per passenger for a flight protection scheme \u2013 similar to the Atol system used at present \u2013 but covering all travellers. The then transport secretary, Chris Grayling, promised to swiftly introduce the changes but legislation has yet to be tabled.\n\nThomas Cook was in need of a financial restructuring as it buckled under the weight of a \u00a31.7bn debt pile racked up during its 2007 merger with MyTravel and a subsequent acquisition spree that has since been heavily criticised. Deals include the 2010 high street travel agency tie-up with Co-op, which increased the number of high street shops it had to 1,200, even as customers were increasingly buying holidays online.\n\nThomas Cook nearly collapsed the following year and had to be rescued by its lenders, leading to it rack up even higher debts.\n\nOne company insider said the company had spent \u00a31.3bn on making interest payments since then. This meant that of the 11m holidays it sold each year, the profit from 3m of them was going directly to its banks.\n\nThe debt burden restricted the company efforts to adapt to the internet age \u2013 it had 560 shops on the UK high street \u2013 and made it more vulnerable to short-term shocks that affected bookings.\n\nThese include terror attacks and political upheaval in north Africa, high jet fuel prices and last summer\u2019s heatwave, which persuaded people across the UK and Thomas Cook\u2019s vital Scandinavian market to stay at home and soak up the sun. Thomas Cook has 21,000 staff and, at the time of collapse, had about 600,00 customers abroad including British, Scandinavian and German holidaymakers.\n\nThomas Cook also cited the negative impact of Brexit uncertainty when it reported a \u00a31.5bn loss earlier this year.\n\nWhile staff, holidaymakers and tourism resorts suffered the fallout from its collapse, some winners are already emerging from Thomas Cook\u2019s demise. Shares in its main competitor, Tui, were up nearly 7% in early trading, while easyJet, which is laying on some of the repatriation flights and also competed on low-cost routes, gained 3%.\n\nHedge funds that bet against Thomas Cook are also understood to have made tens of millions of pounds.\n\nAirlines that competed with Thomas Cook have already begun hiking prices. These include including Virgin Atlantic, which increased the cost of a flight from Manchester to Orlando, Florida, next summer from \u00a3890 to \u00a31242 overnight.\n\nChinese tourism company Fosun, which was prepared to inject \u00a3450m into Thomas Cook as its largest shareholder, said: \u201cFosun is disappointed that Thomas Cook Group has not been able to find a viable solution for its proposed recapitalisation.\u201d\n\nBanks and hedge funds were due to provide another \u00a3450m but the proposal collapsed after banks, led by Royal Bank of Scotland, demanded the company find another \u00a3200m.\n\nIn a joint statement lenders, including RBS, said they were deeply disappointed that Thomas Cook could not be rescued. They insisted they had supported the company, even as it haemorrhaged \u00a31bn of cash over the past year.", "description": "Holidaymakers left waiting in airports around the world for state-backed airlifts home", "authors": ["Rob Davies", "Gwyn Topham", "Nils Pratley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fbe9d9f0829e4668a47833125b69a3c0bd5e324/0_302_3519_2111/master/3519.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=486b8356074e575fb7062e806ca079db", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
