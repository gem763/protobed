It was a good boost to our team, to be sure.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons (1-6) suffered their fifth straight loss.\n\nRyan\u2019s right leg bent awkwardly as he was sacked by Aaron Donald in the fourth quarter, causing a fumble that Donald recovered.\n\nRyan limped off the field and was escorted to the medical tent on the sideline. He walked to the locker room, still favoring the ankle, with 7:36 remaining in the game.\n\nCoach Dan Quinn said he did not know the severity of Ryan\u2019s injury. Ryan wore a walking boot in the locker room and was not made available for his usual postgame news conference.\n\nDonald was credited with a sack, forced fumble and recovery on the play. It was the Rams\u2018 fifth sack of Ryan, matching the five sacks by Atlanta\u2019s defense this season - none in the last four games.\n\n\u201cThat amount of quarterback hits and sacks for sure was a real factor in this game,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nMatt Schaub replaced Ryan and threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Austin Hooper with 2:36 remaining.\n\nThe final insult for Atlanta came with only 11 seconds left, when Kenjon Barner fumbled a punt return when hit by Troy Reeder and Darious Williams recovered in the end zone for a touchdown.\n\nRyan\u2019s injury was the latest and perhaps most damaging dose of bad news for the woeful Falcons. Quinn\u2019s job security appears shaky at best as he quickly runs out of time to avoid a second straight losing season.\n\nQuinn, who took on the added role of defensive coordinator following a 7-9 finish in 2018, revealed after the game that he began assigning some defensive play-calling duties to assistants in last week\u2019s loss at Arizona and continued to share that role on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always looking to do anything that\u2019s best for the team,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cMy ego is never bigger than the team.\u201d\n\nQuinn said he doesn\u2019t believe he has lost the team or the season.\n\n\u201cI never think you\u2019re out of the fight,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t think that way as a team member and I certainly don\u2019t think that way as a coach.\u201d\n\nAtlanta\u2019s frustrations showed in a third-quarter fight between running back Devonta Freeman and Donald that led to Freeman\u2019s ejection. The two locked up after Ryan\u2019s pass off Mohamed Sanu\u2019s hands was intercepted by Cory Littleton deep in Atlanta territory with the Rams leading 20-3.\n\nFreeman had his hands on Donald\u2019s facemask before throwing a punch at the much bigger defensive tackle, which appeared to make little if any contact. Umpire Terry Killens finally pulled Freeman away from Donald, taking Freeman to the ground in an apparent unintentional body slam before quickly helping Freeman to his feet.\n\nEach player drew unnecessary roughness penalties, and Freeman was tossed for throwing the punch.\n\nThe turnover left the Rams at the Atlanta 16 for a short drive capped by Goff\u2019s 1-yard scoring run.\n\nWith running back Ito Smith already out with an injury, Freeman\u2019s ejection left Brian Hill and return specialist Kenjon Barner as the options at running back.\n\nGoff completed 22 of 37 passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns. Blake Bortles took over on the Rams\u2018 final possession.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s offense struggled even before Freeman\u2019s exit and Ryan\u2019s injury. The Falcons were limited to 224 yards.\n\nAs expected, Ramsey shadowed Falcons standout Julio Jones much of the game. Jones had six catches for 93 yards in his first matchup with Ramsey.\n\nGoff threw a perfectly placed 13-yard touchdown pass to Todd Gurley early in the second quarter. He added an 8-yard scoring pass to Gerald Everett in the third quarter.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nSmith was carted off the field late in the first quarter with head and neck injuries following a helmet-to-helmet hit from Rams linebacker Cory Littleton. There was no flag. Smith did not return.\n\nTRADE RUMORS\n\nFalcons defensive end Vic Beasley Jr. said he has heard reports he could be traded. \u201cI\u2019m aware of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to continue to try to help this team win games as long as I\u2019m here. If a trade does happen, I\u2019ll just take it as it is.\u201d\n\nNEW-LOOK SECONDARY\n\nRamsey moved into a revamped secondary. The Rams placed cornerback Aqib Talib and safety John Johnson on injured reserve this week and traded cornerback Marcus Peters to Baltimore. That left safety Eric Weddle as the only holdover starter.\n\nThe new mix held up well. Ryan completed 16 of 27 passes for only 159 yards with an interception.\n\nDIRTY BIRD, RAMS STYLE\n\nEverett, an Atlanta native, celebrated by doing the \u201cDirty Bird\u201d dance made famous in the Falcons\u2018 1998 Super Bowl season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Rams will remain in Atlanta to practice at Georgia Tech for a few days before flying to London for next Sunday\u2019s game against Cincinnati.\n\nThe Falcons will play the Seahawks in another home game next Sunday. Seattle leads the series 10-8, including two playoff games won by Atlanta.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jalen Ramsey's entrance boosted the Los Angeles Rams' hopes they can return to the postseason.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/rams_falcons_football_58035_c0-128-3080-1924_s1200x700.jpg?ebc977326f4f95162133dca0450e77a4b56d11dd", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
