And when individuals have the power, not just to dream but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s full integration into global capitalism has proven liberatory for its people in many respects. Unfettered access to foreign consumer markets and capital (along with illicit access to American intellectual property) has helped China sustain its rapid growth. And that growth has expanded and enriched the nation\u2019s fledgling middle class, while pulling tens of millions of less fortunate Chinese workers out of extreme poverty.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the end of history: To this point, the economic benefits of globalization have done less to undermine China\u2019s authoritarian government than to legitimize it. (This is not to deny that the dissonance between China\u2019s liberal economic system and one-party state has produced real tensions and democratic movements. It is merely to acknowledge that under Xi Jinping, China has managed to grow more economically liberal and more politically autocratic simultaneously.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the future neoliberals wanted. But it isn\u2019t one that they regarded as inconceivable, either. Clinton always laced his triumphalist predictions with caveats about Chinese agency: Globalization might open the door to democracy, but the Chinese people would still need to usher it in. Thus, Beijing\u2019s failure to import our democratic values isn\u2019t an indictment of Clinton\u2019s geopolitical imagination. Xi Jinping\u2019s burgeoning success at exporting Chinese political values to corporate America, however, sure looks like one.\n\nOn Friday night, the general manager of the Houston Rockets saw a meme calling on internet users to \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d Being a child of the Cold War, Daryl Morey initially processed this expression of solidarity with pro-democracy protesters in a communist country as a political sentiment so bipartisan and inoffensive, an NBA general manager could mindlessly retweet it. And so Morey did.\n\nIn so doing, he cost his team the sponsorship of both the Li-Ning shoe company and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Card Center. The Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 a federation led by former Rockets center Yao Ming \u2014 suspended its cooperation with the Houston franchise. The Rockets owner disavowed Morey\u2019s outrageous views on the propriety of civil-rights protests. Conversations about firing Morey commenced. The general manager returned to Twitter Sunday night to assure the public that he had never intended to endorse any political struggle that might inconvenience him or his employer.\n\n1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\n2/ I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nFor its part, the NBA released a pair of statements on the matter, one in an esoteric dialect of American English known as \u201cCrisis Communications Doublespeak\u201d:\n\nWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\n\nAnd a second in \u201cState Chinese\u201d:\n\nWe are extremely disappointed by the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, who has undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of our Chinese fans. Morey has now clarified that his comments do not represent the position of the Rockets or the NBA.\n\nFor American NBA fans, this was all a bit jarring. After all, the league is famous for its relatively high tolerance of politically controversial speech. The NBA has allowed one of its most beloved coaches to call the president of the United States a \u201csoulless coward\u201d and its premier player to speak out against racist policing. If those divisive stances aren\u2019t beyond the pale, why would voicing solidarity with Hong Kong \u2014 a cause endorsed by Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 trigger a chorus of recriminations and apologies?\n\nThe answer is that getting on the wrong side of resentful Trump supporters does not threaten the NBA\u2019s business model, but getting on the wrong side of Beijing does. The most coveted domestic demographic for both consumer-facing brands and sports leagues is young, urban-dwelling adults. And in the U.S., those consumers lean woke. Nike didn\u2019t embrace Colin Kaepernick out of deep-seated commitment to combating structural racism. And the NBA hasn\u2019t indulged their players\u2019 free-speech rights on purely ideological grounds; associating itself with progressivism (or, at least, tolerance for progressivism) is a sound business proposition for the league.\n\nBut aligning itself against Chinese repression in Hong Kong is not. Basketball is the most popular sport in the world\u2019s most populous country. There are more NBA fans in China than there are people in the United States. The NBA is poised to make $1.5 billion off its streaming agreement with Chinese media company Tencent over the next five years. The league and its ownership care a lot more about keeping that money in the bank than bringing democracy to Hong Kong.\n\nIn this respect, the NBA is hardly exceptional. As Max Read notes, in recent years, American and European companies have made a regular habit of apologizing for their accidental contradictions of the Communist Party line. Last year, Marriott fired a social-media manager for liking a post complimenting the hotel chain for its (unintentional) endorsement of Tibetan independence. Around the same time, Mercedes-Benz issued an apology for quoting the Dalai Lama on Instagram. After learning that one of its T-shirts featured a map of China that did not include Taiwan or various disputed islands in the South China Sea, the Gap expressed its regrets and affirmed its respect for \u201cChina\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d Versace apologized for a similar offense in August, saying in a statement, \u201cVersace reiterates that we love China deeply, and resolutely respect China\u2019s territory and national sovereignty.\u201d\n\nBy itself, U.S. consumer brands\u2019 disinterest in advocating for Tibetan independence or democracy in Hong Kong isn\u2019t especially concerning. But the cravenness of its capitulation on these largely symbolic issues (symbolic in the sense that Gap T-shirts are not going to make or break the \u201cFree Tibet\u201d movement) gives little confidence that corporate America will do the right thing in higher-stakes conflicts between its firms\u2019 putative values and desire for Chinese market share. Heck, one can almost imagine Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d brigade helping Xi Jinping to build a better surveillance state.\n\nOf course, America does not need to its import invasive intelligence agencies or authoritarian political movements. The leading threats to democracy in this country were all born in the USA. The scarily plausible alternative to Clinton\u2019s dream of democratizing China through free trade is not Xi imposing one-party capitalism on the U.S. through the same process. Rather, it is that our plutocratic version of liberal democracy and China\u2019s illiberal version of state capitalism will continue converging toward the same version of kleptocracy. Former World Bank economist Branko Milanovi\u0107 raised this menacing hypothetical in a recent interview:\n\nIn the \u201cend of history\u201d or \u201cwhy nations fail\u201d literature, the convergence is basically seen unilaterally: the terminus of history is liberal rule-based capitalism. But I think a very different convergence can be imagined \u2026 With the current movement toward plutocracy in liberal capitalism, you have rich people who are able to influence the policies of national governments. Essentially, economic power gets conflated with political power. In the case of political capitalism like China\u2019s, it is political power that is often transmuted into economic power. The outcome in both cases may be the same: the concentration of both political and economic power in the hands of an elite.\n\nU.S.-Sino relations are in a state of flux, to put it mildly. Political convergence is possible to imagine, but so is economic decoupling. The NBA taking a craven position on Hong Kong does not mean that our children are destined to live under a government of transnational unity led by a grand coalition of American and Chinese oligarchs. It just makes that specter a bit more haunting.", "description": "Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement Friday.
