As of Sunday night a round-trip last-minute ticket from Johannesburg to Tokyo would set you back at least R21,000, and more likely around R24,000.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Scalped tickets \u2013 which organisers promise will get you kicked out of the stadium \u2013\u00a0currently start at around R6,000, but the good seats are a lot more pricey than that.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9405/c52c74306f354bfc88af003ea96e3384.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
