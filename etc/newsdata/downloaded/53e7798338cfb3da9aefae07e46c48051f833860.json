If you use a device that charges via USB-C, you\u2019ll want to know about this deal on a 61W wall charger, which reduces the usual price by almost half. Normally $49.99, you can get the charger for $26.99 by clipping the coupon on the Amazon product page, then entering the offer code 9TO5UXE8 at checkout.\n\nAs an example, 61 watts is enough power to charge a 13-inch MacBook Pro at full speed. It also works with devices that don\u2019t pull juice at that speed, like the iPad Pro, a phone, the Nintendo Switch, and more. If you have a laptop that requires, say, an 85W charger, this won\u2019t charge it as fast, though it could make for a good secondary charger.\n\nAmazon is selling refurbished models of Apple\u2019s latest iPad Pro for hundreds less than the cost of a new device. This sale focuses on the LTE-ready model that can be added to your carrier plan. Amazon claims that each of these \u201crenewed\u201d tablets works and looks like new, and is covered by a 90-day guarantee that allows you to return or refund the purchase.\n\nSatechi announced two new USB-C hubs last week, both of which add the ability to output to a 4K display at 60Hz (the previous model topped out at 30Hz). They\u2019re 20 percent off until September 3rd at Amazon.\n\nThe first, the Dual Multimedia Adapter, offers two HDMI ports (one supports 60Hz, the other supports 30Hz), two USB 3.0 ports, an Ethernet port, a USB-C PD port, and microSD / SD slots. Normally it costs $109.99, but the offer code DUALDISPLAY at Amazon brings it down to $88.\n\nOn the other hand, if all you care about is outputting to 4K displays, the Dual HDMI Adapter is what you want. Unlike the option above, this only offers two HDMI ports that support 4K resolution at 60Hz. Given its pared-back port lineup, this adapter starts at a much lower $64.99, but you can get it for $52 with the same offer code used at Amazon.", "description": "You can save almost 50 percent on RavPower\u2019s GaN USB-C wall charger. Refurbished iPad Pros with LTE connectivity are cheaper, too, as are Satechi\u2019s new USB-C hubs that can output to two 4K displays at once with 60Hz refresh rate.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XFE2j4xZexWozoTudV7NsVBTNs=/0x90:1867x1067/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19119952/ravpower61w.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
