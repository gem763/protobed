My wife and three children, I am happy for them to come and witness history.\"\n\nMaintaining a very regular pace at around 2:50 minutes per kilometre, he passed the finish line gesturing and smiling.\n\nHe had been 11 seconds in advance at mid-race as fans lining the course, many waving Kenyan flags, loudly cheered him on.\n\nKipchoge told reporters earlier this week that his attempt in the Austrian capital was about \"making history in this world, like the first man to go to the moon\".\n\n\"I just have to make that click in people's minds that no human is limited,\" he had said.\n\nBecause of the way the run was set up and paced the International Association of Athletics Federations will not validate the time as a world record.\n\nThe running surface had been partly retarred and readied with other features such as a banked corner that could save time and avoid injury.\n\nPacemakers took turns to support him throughout the 42.195-kilometre (26.219-miles) race. They included 1,500-metre Olympic champion Matthew Centrowitz and former world champion Bernard Lagat.\n\nThe course included a 4.3 kilometre-long straight alley, which the Kenyan ran up and down several times amid dry but foggy weather.\n\n\"The course is extremely good. I'm happy with the course,\" Kipchoge, whose family has accompanied him to Vienna, said earlier this week.\n\nChris Froome, leader of Ineos cycling team, also watched Kipchoge's race in Vienna, according to the organisers.\n\nOrganisers only allowed their own cameras to film the run itself.\n\nThrongs of fans cheered on Kipchoge whenever he passed by.\n\n\"It's history in the making. I'm very proud... It will be a motivation to a lot of young people. People are looking up to him,\" said Nichasius Koech, 37, a software engineer from Kenya who works in Germany, ahead of the run.\n\nAnother fan, Joe Saissi, 25, from London said it was \"a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\".\n\nKipchoge already tried in May 2017 to break the two-hour barrier, running on the Monza National Autodrome racing circuit in Italy, failing narrowly in 2hr 00min 25sec.\n\nBut this time he said before the race that he was mentally stronger and more confident.\n\nThe course had been prepared so that it should take Kipchoge just about 4.5 seconds more than on a computer-simulated completely flat and straight path, according to analysis by sports experts at Vienna University.\n\nIn total, he only had to descend 26 metres in altitude and climb 12 metres, the experts said.\n\nThe founder of the main sponsors, Ineos, British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, is taking a personal interest in the challenge and himself competes in Ironman triathlons.\n\nThe world marathon record has, for the past 16 years, been contested uniquely between athletes from Kenya and Ethiopia. The two nations are also fierce rivals for distance medals on the track.\n\nKipchoge's record was almost beaten last month in the Berlin marathon by Ethiopia's Kenenisa Bekele, who ran 2:01.41, just two seconds short of the official world mark.\n\nThe moment that @EliudKipchoge made history by becoming the first person to run a sub-two-hour-marathon.\n\n????????pic.twitter.com/mo1BIGtxSs#INEOS159 \u2014 SuperSport ????
