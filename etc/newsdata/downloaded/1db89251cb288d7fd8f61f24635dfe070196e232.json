But the Kurdish fighters, which are part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., have been the United States\u2019 most reliable partner in fighting the Islamic State in a strategic corner of northern Syria.\n\n[Update: Trump declares \u201cTime for us to get out\u201d of Syria as allies object.]\n\nNow, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision goes against the recommendations of top officials in the Pentagon and the State Department who have sought to keep a small troop presence in northeast Syria to continue operations against the Islamic State, or ISIS, and to act as a critical counterweight to Iran and Russia.\n\nAdministration officials said that Mr. Trump spoke directly with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on the issue on Sunday. And the officials indicated that the 100 to 150 United States military personnel deployed to that area would be pulled back in advance of any Turkish operation but that they would not be completely withdrawn from Syria.", "description": "The operation would sweep away American-backed Kurdish forces near the border in Syria.
