She was inspired by her father, an artist, whose varied work included decorating coffins. Her mother, meanwhile, signed her up with ballet classes when she was less than three years old, which also brought her closer to the work she does today. \u201cWe performed on really big stages and had to help do our own make-up every time,\u201d she remembers. The older she got and the more theater performances she participated in, the more Janina's dream took shape -- even though being a hair and make-up artist was beyond her imagination at the time.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take me a long time to do my own thing,\u201d says Janina. After training as hairdresser and going to make-up school in Hamburg she touched down in Berlin a year ago by kind of accident. Not a bad place to experiment and give things a try. It\u2019s the people here who inspire her, her friends and her surroundings. \u201cI felt creatively unchallenged in the industry,\u201d admits Janina \u201cI knew that something had to happen but couldn\u2019t say exactly what it was.\u201d With hindsight, it appears that Berlin was just what she needed.\n\nPhoto: Janina Zais\n\nThrough a mutual project with meme artist Tom Galle and the boys from Sucuk und Bratwurst she found her calling: painting heads. \u201cBefore, there was no overlap. I either did hair or I did make-up,\u201d says Janina. \u201cNow I found something that connects the dots.\u201d Something Berlin\u2019s creative scene is more than happy about, as it gets bilious green aliens and knife-sharp flame designs painted on the heads of its citizens almost every day.\n\nPhoto: Janina Zais\n\nJanina is a self-described perfectionist. What seems to be \u2018perfect\u2019 in the eyes of most people is not good enough in hers. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you,\u201d she says. \u201cAll you need is to hustle your ass off every single day.\u201d Of course, you need a bit of luck and have to know the right people, too -- but still, she says, remember to not give up that easily. \u201cFor a long time I really had problems to find my own creative language,\u201d Janina adds. \u201cBut in the end it\u2019s about finding something that is zeitgeisty.\u201d\n\nFoto: Janina Zais\n\nOften people reach out to her with a specific idea but most of the time the Berlin based artist feels inspired by \"weird stuff.\" Whether it\u2019s some crazy Instagram posts, t-shirts prints or Pinterest: \u201cI see something and think about how cool it would look on a head.\u201d It\u2019s not all about looking good though the message behind it is key. \u201cI want to start making a statement,\u201d explains Janina in the end. \u201cI want to use the head as a platform or canvas to reveal political messages.\u201d If we use our clothes to express who we really are, why don\u2019t we use our heads, too?\n\n@janinazais\n\nPhoto: Janina Zais\n\nPhoto: Janina Zais\n\nPhoto: Janina Zais\n\nThis article originally appearedon i-D DE.", "description": "From aliens to flames, Janina Zais is using heads as her canvas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d92244f4fc1d60009c032ac/lede/1569859295981-janina-zais-hair-inspo-tribal.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8942xh;0xw,0.0019xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
