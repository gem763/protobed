Went to one of the same high schools as Elon so could have been local lingo. \u2014 Gillian Rightford (@grightford) September 17, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve heard it in some circles, ya. \u2014 xsyn (@xsyn) September 17, 2019\n\nBut the phrase was apparently not as common as Musk makes it out to be.\n\nI never heard it used that way, and I\u2019m the same age as him. Maybe it was a Pretoria thing, but it\u2019s more likely just a legal evasion thing. \u2014 Jacques Rousseau (@JacquesR) September 17, 2019\n\nI'm four years older than him. Didn't use it when I was growing up in Durban \u2014 Joe Stolley (@joestolley) September 17, 2019\n\nMusk's court filings also revealed he had spent the equivalent of around R740,000 on a private investigator to look into Unsworth after their spat.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The use of the phrase seems to have been quite limited, based on the recollections of South Africans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7406/a489dd4e5cf34380932acaf8fa9db774.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
