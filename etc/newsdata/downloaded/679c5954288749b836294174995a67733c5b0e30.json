European transfer sagas 1/21 European transfer sagas The English transfer window may have closed but a number of big money players could still switch clubs this month. Here are the 20 European transfer sagas you need to be aware of. Getty 2/21 Ousmane Dembele (Barcelona) Persistently linked with a move away from Barcelona. Recent reports in Spain speculate that he could be used as a makeweight in Barcelona's attempt to sign Neymar. Getty Images 3/21 Philippe Coutinho (Barcelona) Arsenal and Tottenham both investigated the possibility of signing the Brazilian on loan. Now in talks with Bayern Munich. Getty 4/21 Bruno Fernandes (Sporting) His representatives had talks with both Manchester United and Tottenham before the English transfer deadline. Now looks destined to stay at Sporting for another summer. EPA 5/21 Ante Rebic (Eintracht Frankfurt) The Croatia international is a target for various Italian clubs although Eintracht Frankfurt sporting director Fredi Bobic said this week the club are yet to recieve any offer. Getty Images 6/21 Dejan Lovren (Liverpool) Liverpool's fourth-choice centre-back now looks destined to leave the club. In talks with Roma over a \u00a315m move. EPA 7/21 Rodrigo (Valencia) Atletico Madrid are close to agreeing a \u20ac60m deal for the 28-year-old, who scored 14 goals in 50 appearances for Valencia last season. Getty Images 8/21 Paulo Dybala (Juventus) Had talks with Manchester United. Came close to signing for Tottenham Hotspur. Could yet leave for Paris Saint-Germain, particularly if they sell Neymar. REUTERS 9/21 Gareth Bale (Real Madrid) Real Madrid are desperate to offload the 30-year-old but have had difficulty in finding a suitor, particularly after Florentino P\u00e9rez pulled the plug on a cut-price move to the Chinese Super League. Getty Images 10/21 Fernando Llorente (Tottenham) The veteran striker is a free agent after his Tottenham contract expired. Currently in talks with Serie A side Napoli. REUTERS 11/21 Hakim Ziyech (Ajax) Had talks with various clubs before signing a new long-term contract with Ajax this week. Getty Images 12/21 Gianluigi Donnarumma (AC Milan) Paris Saint-Germain are interested in the 20-year-old and could make a move before their September transfer deadline. His transfer fee would almost certainly surpass the \u00a371.6m Chelsea paid for Kepa. REUTERS 13/21 Joel Veltman (Ajax) The defender was a target for West Ham and came close to a move to the Premier League. Could yet leave Ajax but now looks more likely to stay. Getty Images 14/21 Donny van de Beek (Ajax) Another player linked with Real Madrid. \"If he moves to Madrid, I am really happy for him. I think he deserves it,\" former team-mate Frenkie de Jong said this week. Getty Images 15/21 Mauro Icardi (Inter Milan) Recently stripped of the No.9 shirt and in talks with a number of clubs. But his image rights are proving obstructive to a move out of Milan. Now where have we heard that before ... ? REUTERS 16/21 Mesut Ozil (Arsenal) Missed Arsenal's opening match of the season because of security concerns and there is a chance he will move to DC United, to replace Wayne Rooney. Arsenal FC via Getty Images 17/21 James Rodriguez (Bayern Munich) Real Madrid are desperate to offload him. Napoli were in talks but couldn't finance a move. Looking increasingly likely he will remain in Spain for another season, at least. REUTERS 18/21 Serge Aurier (Tottenham) Has reportedly told team-mates he wants to quit Spurs after falling behind Kyle Walker-Peters and Juan Foyth in the pecking order. Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I 19/21 Neymar (Paris Saint-Germain) Barcelona are exploring a loan deal for Neymar, in order to bring him in this summer before a permanent move.\n\n\n\nThe forward\u2019s situation at Paris Saint-Germain has become untenable, with Neymar having made clear his desire to leave, the fans abusing him, and the club realising it is in everyone\u2019s best interest to move him on. They have been actively looking for replacements - including Juventus\u2019 Paolo Dybala - but the situation remains complicated by technical and financial issues, particularly regarding Financial Fair Play. REUTERS 20/21 Christian Eriksen (Tottenham) Will sit down for talks with Spurs this month after a move away failed to materalise. Could leave this summer. Or could see out the season in north London before leaving on a lucrative free transfer. Action Images via Reuters 21/21 Paul Pogba (Manchester United) Manchester United are desperate to keep him but Real Madrid may make a move before the end of the window. Pogba certainly hopes so: \u201cThis question mark remains,\u201d he said after United's opening match of the season. \u201cObviously there have been things said, but only time will tell.\u201d REUTERS 1/21 European transfer sagas The English transfer window may have closed but a number of big money players could still switch clubs this month.
