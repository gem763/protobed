Warren will continue in his role as chief financial officer through the close of the Refinitiv deal.\n\nLSE, which was created in 2007 when London Stock Exchange merged with Milan's stock exchange, Borsa Italiana, announced its post trade businesses, which are currently reported separately as LCH and post trade Italy, will be aligned into one post trade division from the start of 2020.\n\nThe post trade services unit, which includes clearing, settlement and custody activities, reported a 19% rise in income from LCH, the clearing house which dominates euro swaps clearing.\n\nLSE's capital markets division, which makes money from fees paid by companies listing on its markets and trading of stocks and bonds, saw revenue rise by 14% in the quarter, as strength in fixed income trading helped counter subdued equity markets trading.
