As soon as we got the first one, I knew it was game on and thankfully we ended up at the end nicking a point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have been there myself in moments when things have not been going great.\n\n\u2018Big clubs\u2019 fans expect result after result and for us to come here, they started well and it settled the crowd down but then it was for us to react, turnaround and not accept that we are going to roll over.\n\n\u2018We hit them on the break a few times and in the end we took a point which, given the tough run of games we\u2019ve got, is a very good point.\u2019\n\nMORE: Arsenal consider stripping Granit Xhaka of captaincy after he told fans to \u2018f*** off\u2019", "description": "Gary Cahill believes Arsenal star Matteo Guendouzi robbed Crystal Palace of a real chance of victory with his 'obvious rugby tackle' on Wilfried Zaha in the dying moments of Sunday's...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-11784835341_1572264405.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
