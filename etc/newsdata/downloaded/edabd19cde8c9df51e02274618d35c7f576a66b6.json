The Washington Post and The New York Times said the settlement was worth $260 million.\n\nNone of the companies reportedly involved in the settlement responded to requests for comment from Business Insider. Walgreens also didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe deal doesn't settle thousands of other lawsuits against drugmakers and distributors. Attorneys general had been pushing for the drugmakers and distributors to agree to settlements worth tens of billions nationally.\n\nShares of all four companies fell in early trading in New York.\n\nRetail pharmacy Walgreens had not reached a settlement related to the lawsuit, the Wall Street Journal said. It's unclear whether the case will continue with Walgreens as sole defendant after the others settled.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2017, more than 218,000 people in the US died from overdoses related to prescription opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

J&J makes prescription opioids including a fentanyl patch. Teva makes generic versions of drugs like oxycodone. The manufacturers are accused of misleading marketing that promoted the drugs' use as pain treatments.\n\nThis isn't the first time drug companies have paid out settlements in connection to opioid lawsuits. In September, OxyContin-makers Purdue Pharma tentatively settled thousands of cases against the company and its owners the Sackler family. The New York Times reported that under the deal the Sacklers would pay $3 billion in settlements over seven years.\n\nDays later, the company filed for bankruptcy.", "description": "Between 1999 and 2017, more than 218,000 people in the US died from overdoses related to prescription opioids.", "authors": ["Lydia Ramsey"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da796a24af909471e066703?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
