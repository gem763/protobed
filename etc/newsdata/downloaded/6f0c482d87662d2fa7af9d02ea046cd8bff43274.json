According to her doctors, the 60-year-old woman had been a guest at a wedding, where she \u201cate a large amount of wasabi, assuming it to be an avocado.\u201d She almost immediately started experiencing chest pain but chose to tough it out.\n\n\u201cAfter she ate the wasabi, she felt a sudden pressure in her chest radiating to her arms, which lasted [a] few hours,\u201d doctors wrote. \u201cShe decided not to leave the wedding and the pain started to subside.\u201d\n\nThe next day, still feeling weak and out-of-sorts, the women visited a local emergency room. While she wasn\u2019t suffering from anything immediately life-threatening, like a heart attack, doctors ultimately diagnosed her with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The condition is characterised by a sudden weakening of the heart\u2019s left ventricle, which causes it to balloon out, resulting in a shape that resembles an octopus trap (in Japan, this trap is called a takotsubo, hence the name). This weakening also causes chest pain that can be reminiscent of a heart attack.\n\nTakotsubo is usually triggered by a heavy dose of stress, which can include the sort of turmoil you might feel from being frightened or from losing a loved one \u2014 and the latter is where the nickname of broken heart syndrome comes from. But in this case, it was probably the wasabi that led to the woman\u2019s symptoms. Why blame the wasabi? There were simply no other potential triggers that made any sense, according to the doctors. If so, it would be the first wasabi-caused case of broken heart ever documented.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about takotsubo. Older women, like the patient in this case, tend to be at higher risk for reasons that aren\u2019t entirely clear (one theory is that menopause can change the heart\u2019s response to stress hormones). So the doctors hope that future research studying the condition can take strange incidents like this into account.\n\nThankfully, though people can die of a broken heart or be more likely to develop heart problems in the future, the condition typically isn\u2019t fatal, and most people recover fine with no special treatment. Within a month\u2019s time, the doctors wrote, the woman was no worse for wear.", "description": "One woman\u2019s wedding wasabi \u2014 apparently mistaken for avocado \u2014 ended up sending her to the emergency room with a strange medical condition called broken heart syndrome, according to a new case study....", "authors": ["Catie Keck", "Matt Novak"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ram8jmw6sqrhyommky3j.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
