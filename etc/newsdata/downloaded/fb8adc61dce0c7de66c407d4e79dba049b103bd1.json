Lloyd Heflin, who was coordinating the effort for the Coast Guard, wrote in a text message to The Associated Press.\n\nThree of the South Korean crew members came out in the midafternoon. The fourth man, who was trapped in a separate compartment, emerged three hours later.\n\nThe rescues followed nearly 36 hours of work after the Golden Ray, a giant ship that carries automobiles, rolled onto its side early Sunday as it was leaving Brunswick, bound for Baltimore.\n\n\u201cAll crew members are accounted for,\u201d Coast Guard Southeast wrote on Twitter. \u201cOperations will now shift fully to environmental protection, removing the vessel and resuming commerce.\u201d\n\nIn the hours immediately after the accident, the Coast Guard lifted 20 crew members into helicopters before determining that smoke and flames and unstable cargo made it too risky to venture further inside the vessel. Officials were also concerned about the stability of the ship, which was carrying 4,000 vehicles, some of which may have broken loose.\n\nThat left responders looking for the remaining four crew members. At first, Reed said, rescuers were not sure whether the noises they were hearing inside were some of the vehicles crashing around. But by dawn Monday, they had grown confident that the taps were responses to their own taps, indicating someone was alive inside.\n\n\u201cIt was outstanding when I heard the news this morning that we had taps back throughout the night,\u201d Reed said, saying it helped lead rescuers to the right place on the 656-foot (200 meter) vessel, and provided motivation.\n\n\u201cThey were charged up knowing the people were alive,\u201d Reed said.\n\nOn Monday morning, rescuers landed on the side of the Golden Ray and rappelled down the hull. Heflin, who was coordinating the search, said they found three men in a room close to the propeller shaft, near the bottom of the stern. Responders began drilling, starting with a 3-inch (7.5-centimeter) hole. Coast Guard officials brought the ship\u2019s chief engineer, who was rescued Sunday, out to the ship to translate, and found the three men were \u201con board and OK,\u201d as Heflin put it.\n\nReed said rescuers passed food and water through the hole to the men. It also provided fresh air to the propeller room, which Reed said was even hotter than outside, where the high was 93 degrees\n\nResponders set up a tent on the hull and began drilling additional holes, eventually making an opening large enough to insert a ladder and help the men climb out.\n\n\u201cIt was like connect-the-dots,\u201d Reed said of the hole, which grew to 2 feet by 3 feet.\n\nThe fourth rescue was a greater challenge. Reed said that crewman was behind glass in a separate engineering compartment on another deck.\n\nThe Golden Ray is now stuck in the shipping channel, closing one of the busiest U.S. seaports for shipping automobiles. One ship is unable to leave port and four more are lined up outside waiting to come in, according to ship-tracking website Marine Traffic.\n\nA statement issued Monday by the South Korea foreign ministry said the crew members were isolated in an engine room. It said 10 South Koreans and 13 Filipinos had been on board, along with a U.S. harbor pilot, when the ship began tilting.\n\nPosition records for the Golden Ray show the ship arrived in port in Brunswick Saturday evening after making the short sail from a prior stop in Jacksonville, Florida. The ship then departed the dock in Brunswick shortly after midnight and was underway only 23 minutes before its movement stopped in the mouth of the harbor where it capsized, according to satellite data recorded by Marine Traffic.\n\nPort officials were \u201cworking closely with the Coast Guard to reopen the channel,\u201d Georgia Ports Authority Executive Director Griff Lynch said in a statement after the final man was rescued.\n\nThe Coast Guard said it was notified of the capsized vessel by a 911 call at about 2 a.m. Sunday.\n\nThe cause of the capsizing remains under investigation. Marine Traffic shows the Golden Ray overturned as it was passed by another car carrier entering St. Simons Sound.\n\nAt the time, the skies were clear and the weather calm, with a southerly breeze of only 5 miles per hour, according to National Weather Service records.\n\nMany of those rescued were taken to the International Seafarers\u2019 Center in Brunswick. Sailors arrived with only what they were wearing when rescued. A restaurant donated a meal, and the volunteer-run center provided the seamen with clothes, toiletries and Bibles.\n\nThe vessel is owned by Hyundai Glovis, which carries cars for automakers Hyundai and Kia as well as others.\n\nNearly 614,000 vehicles and heavy machinery units moved across Brunswick\u2019s docks in the 2019 fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the Georgia Ports Authority.", "description": "Coast Guard rescuers pulled four trapped men alive from a capsized cargo ship Monday, drilling into the hull\u2019s steel plates to extract the crew members more...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ935_USCG_ZG_20190909113646.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
