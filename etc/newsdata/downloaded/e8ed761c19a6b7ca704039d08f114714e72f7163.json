Some people are just too ready to find fault and take offense.\n\nCan you say \u2014 tanned?\n\nGranted, the retouchers went a bit above and beyond with their retouching duties, creating a face that doesn\u2019t look so much like Aniston as it does an Aniston Barbie doll. But that\u2019s not the same as saying Aniston\u2019s donned blackface \u2014 which is what some indeed are saying.\n\nOr that magazine powers-who-be are somehow, in some way, racist \u2014 which again, is what some indeed are saying.\n\n\u201cI get that these covers are supposed to be channelling the glamour of yesteryear but that \u2018glamour\u2019 routinely marginalized women of color for white women (whether made tan or otherwise),\u201d one commentator wrote, as noted by The Los Angeles Times. \u201cSeeing Jennifer Aniston several shades darker than normal reminds me of that legacy. In 2019, if you want a brown-skinned woman on your cover, put a brown-skinned woman on your cover.\u201d\n\nOther comments?\n\n\u201cWhen we asked for south Asian representation in the media this isn\u2019t what we meant,\u201d said one.\n\n\u201cVery brown,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cBlackface,\u201d said a third.\n\nCome on, now.\n\nYou know public sensitivities have gone beyond rational when a girl can\u2019t even sport a tan without someone popping out the race card and crying, \u201cblackface.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
