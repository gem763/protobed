Supernovae and stellar winds blow gas out of the galactic disk into the surrounding halo, where it falls back onto the galaxy to form new stars.\n\nExperts used data taken by the Hubble Space Telescope to survey these flows of gas in and out of the Milky Way, and were surprised to find more gas coming in.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nOur galaxy is stealing gas from its smaller satellite galaxies, enabling it to form stars and planets at a greater rate, a new study has found\n\nAstronomer Andrew Fox of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, and colleagues analysed 200 past ultraviolet observations of the halo of gas that surrounds our galaxy taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nHubble used ultraviolet measurements because the gas clouds that make up the galactic halo are only visible when viewed via this part of the light spectrum.\n\nLight from distant quasars \u2014 the extremely bright cores of active galaxies which are powered by supermassive black holes \u2014 were used to detect the gas clouds.\n\nThe gases absorb certain parts of the quasars' light, allowing the researchers to trace its location. The directions of the gases' movements were determined by how the light's frequency was correspondingly shifted.\n\nFrom this, they were able to gain an unprecedented look at the gas flow across the galaxy and create the first-ever galaxy-wide gas inventory.\n\n'The original Hubble COS observations were taken to study the universe far beyond our galaxy, but we went back to them and analysed the Milky Way gas in the foreground,' said co-author Rongmon Bordoloi of the North Carolina State University.\n\n'It's a credit to the Hubble archive that we can use the same observations to study both the near and the more distant universe.'\n\n'We expected to find the Milky Way's books balanced, with an equilibrium of gas inflow and outflow, but 10 years of Hubble ultraviolet data has shown there is more coming in than going out,' said Dr Fox.\n\nUnderstanding the balance between these two processes is important, because such regulates the amount of material available to form new stars and planets.\n\nIt is unclear, however, exactly where this extra gas is coming from \u2014 although a couple of possibilities present themselves.\n\nOne is that the gas could be being collected from the void between galaxies.\n\nHowever, Fox believes that the Milky Way is likely also raiding the gas 'bank accounts' of its small satellite galaxies, using its greater gravitational pull to siphon off their resources.\n\nAlternatively, hotter gas could be playing a role. The present study only examined cooler gases.\n\nExperts used data taken by the Hubble Space Telescope to survey these flows of gas in and out of the Milky Way (pictured here as seen from the Earth), and were surprised to find more gas coming in. The laser seen in the picture helps the telescopes, in the foreground, focus\n\n'Studying our own galaxy in detail provides the basis for understanding galaxies across the universe,' said paper coauthor and astrophysicist Philipp Richter of the University of Potsdam in Germany.\n\n'We have realised that our galaxy is more complicated than we imagined.'\n\nAt present, the Milky Way is the only galaxy for which we have sufficient data to perform such a comprehensive accounting of gas in and outflows.\n\nWith their present study complete, however, the researchers will be both investigating the source of the additional gas inflow and working to see if other large galaxies \u2014 such as the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy \u2014 behave in the same way.\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nWHAT DOES THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE DO? The Hubble Space Telescope (pictured) recently captured a stunning image of a galaxy 20 million light years away The Hubble Space Telescope was launched jointly by NASA and the European Space Agency. The Hubble is a space-based and long-term observatory. The Hubble observes ultraviolet wavelengths, which the atmosphere filters out, and it collects visible light. 'The Hubble Space Telescope has made some of the most dramatic discoveries in the history of astronomy,' a statement on the Telescope says. The machinery sits more than 370 miles above earth. It can pick up on light via its 'eyes', which are five times more focused than ground-based telescopes. The Hubble focuses on areas in deep outer space 'where some of the most profound mysteries are still buried in the mists of time'.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Astronomers led from the Space Telescope\u00a0Science Institute in Baltimore analysed 200 past observations of the halo of gas that surrounds our galaxy taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19593398-0-image-a-4_1570804446856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
