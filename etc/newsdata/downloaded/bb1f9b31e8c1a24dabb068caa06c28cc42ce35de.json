We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,\u201d said Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\n\u201cWhy? A few reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet,\u201d wrote Dorsey. \u201cPaying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\u201d\n\nA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet.

All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\u201d\n\nInternet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes.

Trying to fix both means fixing neither well, and harms our credibility.\u201d\n\nFor instance, it\u2018s not credible for us to say: \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well\u2026they can say whatever they want! \ud83d\ude09\u201d \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nIn further comments that appeared to criticize the stance of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has resisted pressure from Democrats to ban political ads that contain \u201clies,\u201d or ban political ads altogether, Dorsey said that allowing such ads would be hypocritical.\n\n\u201cit\u2018s not credible for us to say: \u2018We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well\u2026they can say whatever they want!'\u201d said the Twitter CEO.\n\nWe\u2019ll share the final policy by 11/15, including a few exceptions (ads in support of voter registration will still be allowed, for instance). We\u2019ll start enforcing our new policy on 11/22 to provide current advertisers a notice period before this change goes into effect. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nDorsey called for \u201cforward-looking political ad regulation\u201d that goes beyond transparency requirements.\n\n\u201cSome might argue our actions today could favor incumbents,\u201d said Dorsey (another reference to an argument made by Mark Zuckerberg), \u201cBut we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re well aware we\u2018re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem.
