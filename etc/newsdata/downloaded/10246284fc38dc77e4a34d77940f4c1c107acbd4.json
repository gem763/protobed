(Note: you have to laugh at dumb jokes like that, or else we will collectively become the Joker. Sorry! Them\u2019s the breaks.) According to Variety, despite the weeks of controversy and security concerns (or, let\u2019s be honest, because of them), Joker has careened past the previously set box office record, pulling in approximately $93.5 million at 4,374 North American locations and turning in the best October domestic opening weekend since 2018\u2019s Venom, which gobbled up a mere $80 million.\n\nThe movie also excelled abroad, making over $140.5 million on 22,552 screens across the rest of the globe. All and all, that\u2019s a lot of Laffy Taffy. We can only hope that much dough can help this poor super-villain gain the self-esteem he needs to finally turn things around and get back behind the mic.", "description": "Todd Phillips\u2019 controversial film Joker sets a new domestic box office record for the month of October, breaking the record set by Venom.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-joker.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
