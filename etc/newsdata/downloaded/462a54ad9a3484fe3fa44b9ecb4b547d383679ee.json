Among the dead were Poland\u2019s president, his wife and dozens of the country\u2019s top officials.\n\nWhat Poles couldn\u2019t have realized was that the political repercussions of the disaster would help transform their country from one of Europe\u2019s greatest successes into one of its biggest renegades in less than a decade.\n\nJaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president\u2019s twin brother, nurtured a cult of conspiracy around the crash that became the galvanizing force for a movement that made him Poland\u2019s most powerful man. It enabled him to reconfigure the country\u2019s relationship with the rest of the continent to an extent not seen since communism. His ruling Law & Justice party gained sway over the courts, while state companies became political machines, civil liberties were curtailed and public television was turned into a mouthpiece.\n\nThe next phase will determine whether the new Poland is now irreversible. Opinion polls suggest Law & Justice will cement its grip on power in an election Oct. 13. To understand how the country got here, however, you need to go back to the smoldering wreckage of the Tupolev TU-154 jet in the Russian woods.\n\nAs shock gave way to questions about responsibility for the disaster, a political opportunity emerged out of great personal tragedy, according to interviews with former allies and associates of Kaczynski, 70.\n\nHe blamed the Polish establishment for plotting with the Russians to kill his brother. Subsequent investigations declared the crash was an accident. The intrigue, though, divided the country into believers and non-believers, long before the polarization of Donald Trump\u2019s America and Brexit Britain.\n\nFor Kaczynski, this was the foundation of a bid for unprecedented power: Only Law & Justice could save true Poles from a cynical elite kowtowing to Brussels and leeching a flourishing economy while others struggled to make ends meet. And they would do it in the name of God and dignity.\n\n\u201cSmolensk is certainly the moment of clear division into us and them,\u201d said Elzbieta Jakubiak, who worked on Jaroslaw\u2019s attempt to succeed his late brother as president in the wake of the crash. He failed, but politics had shifted, she said. \u201cSmolensk was the natural trigger for polarization.\u201d\n\nThe mourning became political. For 96 months\u2014one for every person who died in the crash\u2014Kaczynski would lead marches of remembrance for the victims on the 10th of every month. On the final occasion, the eighth anniversary in April last year, a black granite monument of a stairway to the sky was unveiled in Warsaw. Memorials and statues of Lech Kaczynski were erected across Poland. Schools and streets were renamed in his honor. Opponents of the theory that he was murdered were called traitors.\n\nKaczynski lost more than a twin brother and lifelong ally. Lech often acted as a brake on Jaroslaw\u2019s more radical ideas, according to people who knew the pair.\n\nFormer child movie actors in the early 1960s, the Kaczynskis grew up to train as lawyers. Lech played a more prominent role in the Solidarity movement that toppled communist rule, while Jaroslaw joined the Helsinki Committee, the group that in 1983 compiled the first report on human-rights abuses under the regime.\n\nWhile Lech was married with a child\u2014the kind of family life now championed by the government\u2014Jaroslaw, or \u201cJarek,\u201d lived with their mother and focused solely on politics. He said in a 2007 interview that he didn\u2019t even have a bank account and kept money in his mother\u2019s.\n\nWhen Lech died, Jaroslaw commissioned three fictional editions of a national newspaper with a front-page story about how the president had been delayed abroad by a volcanic eruption, according to a biography of him by Michal Krzymowski. It meant he could initially avoid having to tell their mother, who was sick at the time.\n\nJaroslaw always seemed to have scores to settle, according to Danuta Przywara, who worked with Kaczynski on the Helsinki Committee, a group she now chairs and which pro-Law & Justice media say is leading a crusade against the government that\u2019s funded by George Soros.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The news on the morning of April 10, 2010, that a Polish air force plane had crashed in dense fog near the Russian city of Smolensk transfixed a nation.
