But the PM will have implicitly shelved hopes of getting his deal through Parliament before the nation votes.\n\nA No10 source said: 'Tonight is Labour's last chance to have an election with Brexit done - they can vote tonight for the 12th and get Brexit done before Parliament is dissolved.\n\n'If not, we will introduce a Bill almost identical to the SNP Bill tomorrow and we will have a pre-Christmas election anyway.'\n\nMr Johnson has said the current Parliament has 'run its course'.\n\n'Across the country there is a widespread view that this Parliament has run its course,' he said.\n\n'I simply do not believe that this House is capable of delivering on the priorities of the people, whether that means Brexit or anything else.'\n\nConservative former minister Robert Halfon intervened to ask the PM: 'In his preparations for a no-deal Brexit, can he make sure there's plenty of corn feed for the election chickens on the opposite benches?'\n\nMr Johnson said the point had been 'elegantly put'.\n\nThe manoeuvring came after Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, announced that Brussels had granted Britain a so-called 'flex-tension' until January 31.\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson has indicated she will order her MPs to support an election as soon as the departure date has been formalised. Her party's priority has been to ensure that a Brexit deal cannot be passed before either a referendum or an election is held.\n\n'We will keep fighting for a People's Vote, but unless Labour wholeheartedly back it then a General Election is the only way we can use this extension to #StopBrexit,' she tweeted today.\n\nFurious Labour Remainers accused the Lib Dems of 'playing for naked political advantage' and handing more advantage to Mr Johnson by 'blowing up' the so-called Remainer alliance.\n\nOne Tory MP told MailOnline that the smaller parties endorsing a snap election would leave Labour 'well and truly stuck'.\n\nBoris Johnson, pictured in Downing Street this morning, previously promised to deliver Brexit 'do or die' and with or without a deal on October 31\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn (pictured today) is still ordering his MPs to abstain on the PM's plan for a December 12 general election\n\nThe European Council president Donald Tusk confirmed that the UK would get another three months to break its Brexit deadlock by either passing a deal or holding a general election\n\nUnder the terms of the extension granted by the EU, if MPs back Mr Johnson's Brexit deal in the coming weeks then the extension can be terminated early and the UK will split from Brussels.\n\nMr Johnson's Plan A was for MPs to back holding an election on December 12.\n\nIf MPs had backed the snap poll then Parliament would have been given until November 6 to agree to the PM's deal - but the election would then go ahead regardless.\n\nHowever, the chances of the PM securing his preferred date always hinged on whether Mr Corbyn and the Labour Party supported it.\n\nWhat are the terms of the Brexit delay offered by the EU to the UK? Donald Tusk announced this morning that the EU had agreed to delay Brexit by up to three months to January 31, 2020. However, the extension will have flexibility built into it. That will mean that if Boris Johnson is able to get his Brexit deal agreed by parliament and then ratified by the European Parliament the extension will be terminated early. If he is able to get his Withdrawal Agreement finalised in November the UK is likely to leave the EU on December 1. If the Brexit deal is finalised in December then the UK will likely leave on January 1 and if it is not sorted until January then the UK will leave the day after the current extension on February 1. Should Mr Johnson fail to get his deal through then the extension will provide enough time for a general election to be held. The EU is also expected to insist as part of the extension package that the UK appoint a new European Commissioner for the duration of the extension.\n\nMr Johnson needed the backing of two thirds of the Commons - 434 MPs - to trigger the election but Mr Corbyn is expected to abstain on the motion.\n\nMr Corbyn previously said he would vote for an election once a No Deal Brexit had been ruled for the next few months, but the party has suggested in recent days that the government must rule out a disorderly departure at any point.\n\nMr Corbyn now faces being outflanked by his political opponents after the Liberal Democrats and the SNP put forward their own plan.\n\nThat would see an election held on December 9.\n\nThe government is believed to have been haggling with the Lib Dems and SNP over pushing the date to December 10 or 11 - although Mr Johnson insisted tonight that he still wants December 12.\n\nCrucially for the Lib Dems, the Brexit Bill would be shelved until after the national ballot.\n\nThe legislation to implement Mr Johnson's deal received its second reading from MPs, but was then 'paused' after the House refused to sign off a breakneck 72-hour timetable to get it on the statute book.\n\nA senior government source was jubilant about the shift, saying it 'feels like we'll get there one way or another'.\n\nIndependent Group leader Anna Soubry raged that the Lib Dems had 'turned their backs' on a second referendum.\n\n'They have, in my view, turned their back on the People's Vote, wrongly claiming there is no majority for it in Parliament. I am sorry to say that old style, selfish, tribal party politics is at play,' she said.\n\nOne Remain-backing Labour MP told MailOnline: 'This is about naked political advantage... they are just blowing things up.'\n\nThe MP said they and anti-Brexit colleagues would still vote against the FTPA motion, but added gloomily: 'I've got to go - I've got a small majority and an election to prepare for.'\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson, pictured in the Commons tonight, has hatched a plan with the SNP to outflank Mr Corbyn if he blocks an election\n\nMr Johnson left Downing Street with his Brexit strategist Dominic Cummings (left) tonight\n\nThe EU has long insisted that it would grant a lengthier delay if it was to make time for the UK to either hold an election or a second referendum.\n\nMr Johnson appears to have persuaded Mr Macron that a general election will dramatically alter the Brexit arithmetic in the House of Commons, finally providing a way through the current impasse.\n\nAn EU source said the extension would last 'only as long as necessary to allow for the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement and, in any event, no longer than January 31 2020'.\n\nBritain would be able to leave the EU on the first day of the month following the ratification of the WAB by both the European and UK parliaments.\n\nBut the source added: 'The United Kingdom will remain a member state until the new withdrawal date, with full rights and obligations, including the obligation to suggest a candidate for appointment as a member of the Commission.\n\n'This extension excludes any re-opening of the Withdrawal Agreement.'\n\nThe text will be submitted to the UK for agreement, before a written procedure is launched to adopt the decision - with the process likely to be concluded tomorrow or Wednesday.\n\nOne potential sticking point in the EU's extension offer is that the UK will likely be required to nominate and send a UK Commissioner after October 31.\n\nMr Johnson previously said Britain would stop sending one after October 31 \u2013 the day he said Brexit would happen.\n\nThe EU is also adamant that no major changes can be made to the Prime Minister's deal.\n\nIt says: 'The European Council firmly states that it excludes any reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement in the future and recalls that any unilateral commitment, statement or other act by the United Kingdom should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement.'\n\nMr Tusk has been in intensive discussions with EU leaders over the weekend.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, pictured today leaving his London home, is under growing pressure to back a pre-Christmas election\n\nBoris Johnson, pictured in Downing Street this morning, will ask MPs to vote today for an election to be held on December 12 but without Labour's support his plan is likely to be scuppered\n\nA majority of Labour MPs are believed to be opposed to a pre-Brexit election.\n\nOne set out their opposition in colourful terms to the Politics Home website as they said: 'I won't be voting for a general election come hell or high water. They can go f*** themselves. Brexit must be sorted.\n\n'As for winning, you've got to be pretty dim to ask for the chequered flag when you're stuck at the back of the grid.'\n\nMany recent opinion polls have Labour trailing the Tories by double digits with senior party figures fearing the worse if there is an election in the near future.\n\nBut while many in Labour are downbeat on their chances at an election, the pro-Remain Lib Dems and SNP are champing at the bit to go to the country early.\n\nBoth believe a pre-Brexit election is in their favour, hence why they have joined forces on the plan to force a poll on December 9.\n\nThat is the absolute earliest an election could be held because of rules which dictate there must be 25 working days before polling day.\n\nThe December 9 date would be three days before the PM's proposed date and, crucially, when more students are still at university to cast their votes in Remain-supporting target swing seats.\n\nThe draft law, currently earmarked to be tabled tomorrow, would require a simple majority of 320 MPs to support it in order to dissolve Parliament - 114 fewer than under the FTPA 'super majority' rules.\n\nMs Swinson said the proposal would tie Mr Johnson's hands over the election date and would not give him the 'wriggle room' that his own plan would have.\n\nMany opposition MPs fear that if they voted for an election Mr Johnson could then change the date to force a No Deal Brexit - something Downing Street has long dismissed as nonsense.\n\n'And because people can't trust what this man says, I think setting that date in law is a very good idea,' Ms Swinson told the BBC' Radio 4 Today programme.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader said there were various reasons why December 9 made more sense than December 12 for an election.\n\n'Clearly, it's three further days away from Christmas and I understand that the public appetite for an election around Christmas is not necessarily high so I think, from the point of view of the economy and retailers, keeping it as far away as possible is helpful,' she said.\n\n'What waiting would do is risk No Deal, because if we waste this extension and we end up in January with that 31st of January deadline looming, assuming it is granted today, and we haven't done anything with this time, then there's no guarantee the EU will extend again and then no-deal is back on the table.'\n\nJohn McDonnell responded with fury to the prospect of the Lib Dems, SNP and Tories working together to force an early election\n\nThe prospect of the Lib Dems and SNP working with the Tories to force an early election sparked anger from Labour frontbenchers.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, tweeted: 'Looks like the Lib Dem and Tory pact of 2010 is being re-established.\n\n'They are back together, selling out the People's Vote campaign and the cross party campaign to prevent a no deal.\n\n'The Lib Dems will stop at nothing to get their ministerial cars back.'\n\nLast night Labour frontbencher Lucy Powell told the Westminster Hour that an 'election soon is now both inevitable and necessary'.\n\nShe said: 'Parliament is in a deadlock and we need to break that deadlock somehow, even if Brexit is done.\n\n'The issue is the terms of that election, the when and how of that election. I think what we've seen from the Liberal Democrats and the SNP is trying to shape the terms of that election in a way that would favour them the most, it's pure playing of politics.'\n\nThe Brexit endgame: How the crisis might develop as Boris Johnson struggles to cut ties with EU\n\nThe Prime Minister has missed his 'do or die' Halloween Brexit deadline, which means the UK will stay in the EU until January 31 next year, unless Parliament ratifies his deal before then.\n\nWith that 'flextension' now confirmed by the EU, attention now turns to the matter of a general election.\n\nSo is it as straightforward as setting a date and getting on with it? Not quite. Here is a look at how things stand.\n\nWhat has the PM been trying to do and has he succeeded?\n\nMr Johnson made another election bid under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA), requiring a two-thirds Commons majority - 434 MPs - to have an election on December 12.\n\nBut Labour's lack of support for the proposal meant it was defeated.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has insisted that Labour can only support an election once the threat of a no-deal crash-out from the European Union has been completely ruled out.\n\nWhy is there opposition to an election on December 12?\n\nConcerns have been raised about a December election for a number of reasons - not all of them political.\n\nThere is talk of voters staying away, discouraged by cold wintry evenings, while others could well be booked up with office Christmas parties, nativity plays, shopping and generally busying themselves with festive fun.\n\nThere are also potential issues with councils being unable to book polling stations and count venues with such short notice.\n\nHas December 9 also been mentioned as a potential date?\n\nYes. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford have put forward a tightly-drafted Bill that would grant an election on December 9 - three days earlier than the PM's suggested polling date - as long as the European Union granted the January 31 extension.\n\nThe draft law, currently scheduled to be debated in Tuesday's sitting of the House of Commons, would require a simple majority of 320 MPs to support it in order to dissolve Parliament - 114 fewer than under the FTPA 'super majority' rules.\n\nWhat difference does three days make?\n\nMs Swinson said her proposal ties Mr Johnson's hands over the election date and does not give him the 'wriggle room' that his own plan would have.\n\nShe said it is three further days away from Christmas, adding that keeping the election day as far away from December 25 is in the best interest of the economy.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader also pointed out that December 9 would be a better date for university students who may be leaving university towns to return home for Christmas at the end of term.\n\nAre the Lib Dems and the SNP keen to have an election at the earliest possible opportunity?\n\nIt would seem so. Ms Swinson said December 9 is the earliest possible date to have an election if the Bill is passed, meaning that an election happens 'as soon as possible'.\n\nBoth the Lib Dems and the SNP would hope to benefit from an election before Brexit takes place because they will be hoping to win the backing of people who want Brexit scrapped.\n\nThe Lib Dems have campaigned for a People's Vote, while the SNP has also been vocal in its support of a second Brexit referendum.\n\nSo where does Labour stand on all of this?\n\nWhile some around Jeremy Corbyn back a snap election, many Labour MPs are bitterly opposed to a poll, fearing confusion over the party's position on Brexit will cost them at the ballot box.\n\nThe party has said it will only back an election if Mr Johnson makes 'absolutely clear' that no-deal is off the table now that the January extension has been granted.\n\nBut it is not entirely clear what steps Mr Johnson would have to take to satisfy Labour that no-deal has completely been ruled out.\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott suggested further legislation may be required as promises by Mr Johnson were 'not worth the paper they're written on'.\n\nShe said that Labour would 'discuss' the Lib Dems/SNP Bill with opposition colleagues.\n\nMr Corbyn had previously said he wanted to wait for the EU's decision over the length of the Article 50 extension before deciding whether to whip MPs in support of Mr Johnson's bid for a winter election.", "description": "Boris Johnson has written to the EU accepting its offer of a three-month extension that will keep the UK in the bloc until at least January 31.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/18/20289656-0-image-a-4_1572287477929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
