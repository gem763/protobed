The government blamed the initial startup costs for the loss.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of legal pot outlets in Ontario is expected to grow from 25 to 75 this month.\n\nCannabis was legalized for recreational use in Canada on Oct. 17, 2018.\n\nThe Progressive Conservative government had initially said there would be no cap on the number of retail pot shops after cannabis was legalized. That decision marked a change of course from the previous Liberal government, which created the OCS and had planned to tightly control cannabis sales through government-owned stores similar to the LCBO.\n\nBut the supply shortage prompted the Tory government last December to cap the initial number of pot retail licences to just 25 so operators could open for business on April 1.", "description": "The Ontario Cannabis Store says it will launch consultations later this month in an effort to get the private sector involved in the storage and distribution of marijuana.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5251845.1569404732!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/canntrust-denmark-20190709.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
