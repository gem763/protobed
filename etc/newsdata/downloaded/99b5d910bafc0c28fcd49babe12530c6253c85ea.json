It's a four-panel mural in a prominent location, and it was painted by a very special group: the ROM Youth Cabinet.\n\nEvery Friday night, this group of young people come together at the ROM to learn, communicate and break stereotypes. It's an initiative created in 2015 based on a recommendation from the ROM's Indigenous Advisory Circle. They advised that a group be created wherein Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth could learn together through an Indigenous framework. To this end, the Youth Cabinet's 10 members meet weekly to learn from guest artists, knowledge keepers and elders.\n\nWatch the video:\n\nAmanda Parris learns more from the ROM's Youth Cabinet 3:36\n\nEvery year, the Youth Cabinet creates a final project together, and this year they've been given a very special opportunity at the ROM \u2014 to make a mural that will be permanently displayed in the museum.\n\n\"It's still hard to wrap my head around it,\" says Leslie McCue, the ROM's Indigenous Knowledge Resource Teacher who facilitates the group. \"It's so beautiful to know that every time we come down those stairs, this history is going to be reflected in the ROM.\"\n\nThe Cabinet designed the mural and have been painting it as a group. \"It's been a lot of fun,\" says Kristy-Anne Inglese, the Kiowa Wind Memorial Indigenous Youth Intern at the ROM. \"I didn't realize I could actually keep a steady hand painting.\" The group put all of their learnings over the course of the year into the mural, infusing it with symbolism and personal meaning for them.\n\nThe finished mural installed at the ROM (CBC Arts)\n\nEven the location of the mural's final installation opposite the ROM's totem poles has significance in the project. McCue explains: \"The museum kind of was built around those totems. So if you look in the middle of the mural that the youth created, there is a totem there. So it was important that they're paying respect and there's a dialogue between those two pieces.\"\n\nCBC Arts: Exhibitionists host Amanda Parris stopped by the ROM to meet the Youth Cabinet and get a sneak peek at the mural in progress.\n\nThe official unveiling event for the Youth Cabinet's mural is on Monday, October 21 at 6:30 pm as part of the ROM's 3rd Monday Nights Free program, when the public has free general admission to the museum from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm.\n\nMeet the ROM Youth Cabinet and more on this week's Exhibitionists\n\nIn this week's episode of CBC Arts: Exhibitionists, Amanda Parris explores the Royal Ontario Museum and brings us more stories including tattoo artist Nomi Chi, a levitating screen that's a magical experience for viewers, a painter inspired by the ocean and an artist cutting the Canadian landscape into linoleum.\n\nStream CBC Arts: Exhibitionists or catch it on CBC Television Friday nights at 11:30pm (12am NT) and Sundays at 3:30pm (4pm NT).
