It closed up 0.8 per cent at 616 yuan.\n\nThe increase in prices was curbed by cooling demand as China is coming into autumn-winter heating season, when construction activity slows and may face restrictions depending on air quality controls.", "description": "Iron ore advanced for a third day amid renewed worries about supplies from Brazil's Vale.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c942d2f65d0947d2cc32c62214191fbc3a54f865", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
