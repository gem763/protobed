It\u2019s something the American people have been expecting for a while and both Mr Trump and his predecessor, Barack Obama, have promised to get done, without success. But disagreements remain on how a withdrawal should happen.\n\nThe number of US troops in Afghanistan today \u2013 around 14,000 \u2013 is higher than when Mr Trump entered the White House in 2017. The peace deal with the Taliban was expected to see 5,500 troops withdrawn within five months.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The third Democratic debate this week included a discussion on Afghanistan with candidates called on to explain their vision of how to end it.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, one of the leading Democratic contenders, said US withdrawal should start \u201ctoday\u201d even without a deal with the Taliban. Ms Warren who belongs to the progressive wing of the Democratic party, said what the US is doing in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States, Afghanistan or the world. She added that the US military cannot solve the problem of terrorism across the world.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I want to teach all the girls, so they have access to education.\u201d *Names have been changed to protect identities Andrew Quilty/Save the Children\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, one of the most progressive US politicians and a consistent critic of successive administrations\u2019 foreign policy, boasted that he had been the only person on stage to have voted against \u201call three of Trump\u2019s military budgets\u201d. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to spend $750bn [\u00a3600bn] on the military when we don\u2019t even know who our enemy is.\u201d\n\nHowever, critics of an immediate withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, including senior military officials, believe that ending the long war must be done carefully to ensure that the country does not once again become a safe haven for terrorist groups and future attacks.\n\nGeneral Joseph Dunford, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has recently warned against withdrawal from Afghanistan as he believes the country still needs support to deal with increased levels of violence. General Dunford has said that the US needs to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan and make sure that the country is not a \u201csanctuary\u201d.\n\nThe Afghanistan war began after Al-Qaeda operatives crashed planes into the World Trade Centre in New York, into the Pentagon and into a field in Pennsylvania on 11 September, 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people. Afghanistan was a base for al-Qaeda and one of the countries where the attacks had been planned, although none of the 19 attackers were Afghans. President George W Bush launched the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan and later Iraq.\n\nDuring the debate the Democratic frontrunner and former vice president Joe Biden said the US does not need troops on the ground in Afghanistan and suggested that Pakistan can provide bases for US forces to ensure Afghanistan does not become a terrorist haven.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He told The Independent: \u201cAt the table we must include the concerns of the democratically elected government, ethnic and religious minorities, women, the security forces, and so on.\u201d\n\nReferring to the chaos of the US withdrawal from Vietnam in the mid-1970s following another protracted foreign war, he added that \u201cto simply just leave could result in another Saigon. We cannot ignore our friends and we cannot ignore the violent fate that would befall them, including from terrorist groups, if we get this wrong.\u201d\n\nNearly 200,000 people have been killed in Afghanistan and Pakistan since 2001, more than 60,000 of them civilians, Brown University estimates. These figures do not include deaths from malnutrition, damaged health systems and environment.\n\nSo far nearly 7,000 American and over 600 British service personnel have died in the war zones of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, in addition to thousands of local military and police deaths. Britain has around 1,000 troops still in Afghanistan.\n\nJohn Glaser, foreign policy director at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, says the argument that the war must continue in order to protect the United States from terrorists is \u201cabsurd\u201d.\n\nHe told The Independent: \u201cThere is zero evidence \u2013 zero \u2013 that \u2018fighting them over there\u2019 has stopped us having to \u2018fight them over here\u2019. The idea that a \u2018safe haven\u2019 in Afghanistan will somehow enable al-Qaeda or some other group to launch transnational attacks into US soil is largely a myth.\n\n\u201cHaving territory in remote, landlocked Afghanistan just isn\u2019t much help to terrorist groups trying to attack the US, and not one of the jihadi-inspired attacks on US soil since 9/11 was committed by someone with operational ties to terrorist groups within any safe haven abroad.\u201d\n\nBeyond the human cost, the total US spending for the war in Afghanistan has been approximately $2 trillion so far, according to Brown University. In addition to the federal costs, millions of dollars have been spent by state, municipal, and private entities on services for returning veterans and their families.", "description": "It\u2019s been a week since Donald Trump suddenly cancelled secret talks with the Taliban, after the Afghan group took responsibility for a deadly car bombing in Kabul.", "authors": ["Negar Mortazavi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/23/us-troops-american-military-soldiers-afghanistan-taliban-al-qaeda-war-on-terror.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
