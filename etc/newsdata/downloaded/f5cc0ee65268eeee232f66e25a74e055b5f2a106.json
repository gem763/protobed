Nasdaq-100 futures were off 18 points at 7,941.85, a loss of 0.2%.\n\nThe Dow on Tuesday rose 237.44 points, or 0.9%, to end at 27,024.80, while the S&P 500 advanced 29.53 points, or 1%, to close at 2,995.68, leaving it 1% away from its all-time closing high of 3,025.86 set on July 26. The Nasdaq Composite finished at 8,148.71 after gaining 100.06 points, or 1.2%.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nChina threatened to retaliate over a series of bills backing pro-democracy protesters (link) in Hong Kong that passed the House of Representatives unanimously late Tuesday. A spokesman for China's foreign ministry said that if the legislation were to become law \"it wouldn't only harm China's interest in China-U. S. relations, but would also seriously damage U.S. interests\" and that China \"will definitely take strong countermeasures in response to the wrong decisions by the U.S. side to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\"\n\nSee:China vows 'strong countermeasures' in wake of U.S. bill supporting Hong Kong protesters (link)\n\n\"We think it's possible this bill will push China into a public show of defiance against U.S. 'interference,'\" which could mean a crackdown on Hong Kong protesters, said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, in a note.\n\n\"Under that scenario, markets would be relieved if China's retaliation kept the trade pact intact. However, higher political uncertainty in Hong Kong would be a sizable downside risk,\" Lawler said.\n\nStocks were buoyed Tuesday by a largely well-received round of results from corporate heavyweights, including UnitedHealth Group Inc.(UNH) and JPMorgan Chase & Co.(JPM).\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of Bank of America Corp.(BAC) were higher in premarket action after it reported third-quarter profit that topped Wall Street expectations.\n\nOther earnings expected ahead of the bell Wednesday include Abbott Laboratories(ABT).
