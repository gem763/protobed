He's doing his thing. I don't know if he wants to fight anymore. He's not my concern.\"\n\nFerguson said that McGregor was \"like one of those ex-girlfriends\" and that he \"stopped worrying about that dude.\"\n\nTony Ferguson.

And now he's mentioning my name? Get the f--- out of here, dude. Come on,\" he said.\n\n\"If push comes to shove and then we need to, I mean, I see him fighting the loser of this next fight this weekend,\" he said, adding: \"We are professional. This is what we do. It is the UFC. That's why we have rankings. So me, if I fight for the title next, he's got to fight for the underdog. He wins, and then you know what, maybe I'll give him a shot.\"", "description": "Tony Ferguson is next in line to fight for the UFC lightweight title, challenging the winner of Khabib Nurmagomedov vs. Dustin Poirier on Saturday.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6f99dc2e22af218923162c-1334-667.jpg"}
