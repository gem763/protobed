This may be my biggest sports memory, topping anything Redskins, Wizards or Capitals. We haven\u2019t had a World Series here since 1933, and I\u2019ve always been more of a baseball fan.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d season-plan holder Liz Pomper, who has attended every home playoff game at Nationals Park, and therefore been subjected to her fair share of postseason heartbreak, said. \u201cThis is the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d\n\nIt took roughly 20 minutes for the idea of Washington\u2019s baseball team advancing to the World Series for the first time in 86 years to go from believable to seemingly inevitable. In the span of four outs to open the game, Nationals pitcher Patrick Corbin struck out the side and Ryan Zimmerman crossed the plate with Washington\u2019s fifth run.\n\nGiven how Corbin was pitching and how the Cardinals\u2019 offense, which somehow managed to score 10 runs in one inning against the Braves last week, had looked in this series, five runs would be plenty. When Washington took a 7-0 lead on a Trea Turner single before the first inning was over, the only question was how the rocking home crowd of nearly 44,000 could possibly maintain its energy level for another 24 outs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was a little nervous when we were up 6-0,\u201d said Pomper, who wore a \u201cBaby Shark\u201d hat and couldn\u2019t help but recall the horrors of Game 5 of the 2012 NLDS, when the Nationals blew an early six-run lead against the Cardinals.\n\n\u201cI thought a lot of us were kind of bored after the first inning,\u201d Nationals fan Sandeep Taxali said. \u201cWe thought, okay, this is going to be slow, we\u2019ll win it and we\u2019ll celebrate, but there\u2019s not much of a game here. Then the tide starting turning, and the nerves started popping.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 bats went silent. Yadier Molina hit a solo home run in the fourth and the Cardinals added three more runs off Corbin in the fifth, cutting Washington\u2019s lead to 7-4. In the unusual position for a second straight game of taking a big early lead and then trying to keep its opponent from getting up off the mat, the \u201cStay in the Fight\u201d Nationals absorbed a few blows that left them wobbly and some of their fans mildly concerned.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI chewed on my [rally] towel a little bit,\u201d Gary Rosenthal said. \u201cI kept thinking, where did the hitting go? What are we doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cNinety-nine percent of the games we\u2019ve been to this year have had drama, so we weren\u2019t surprised,\u201d Nationals fan Frankie Engelking said. \u201cIt was like the whole season. It was up and down, we\u2019re going to make it, no we\u2019re not, but we never gave up.\"\n\nThere was a jolt of energy in the bottom of the sixth, when Gerardo Parra stepped to the plate as a pinch-hitter for the first time in the series, resulting in the largest \u2014 and perhaps loudest \u2014 \u201cBaby Shark\u201d singalong in Nationals Park history. Parra singled to right, prompting another round of singing and hand-chomping, before Turner struck out to end the inning.\n\nAD\n\nAnything more wild than a ballpark full of adults and children alike singing \"Baby Shark?\" pic.twitter.com/buK6yJQfKj \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 16, 2019\n\nSt. Louis went quietly in the seventh, but the Cardinals mounted another rally in the eighth, loading the bases against Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson. By then, the crowd was fully engaged again, roaring or groaning after every pitch.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThree! More! Outs!\u201d 27-year old Nick McMillan, who wore a Senators jersey, shouted to no one in particular after Hudson got Matt Carpenter to ground out to end the threat. McMillan then belted out the words to the Beastie Boys anthem \u201cFight For Your Right,\u201d which blared over the ballpark\u2019s speakers during the half-inning break.\n\nWhen Victor Robles squeezed Tommy Edman\u2019s flyball to center field for the final out of the game, it set off a celebration in and around the ballpark, as fireworks lit up the sky. Fans twirled their red rally towels, hugged and high-fived each other and ushers, amid isolated showers of beer and popcorn.\n\nAD\n\nThe moment the Bullpen found out the @nationals ARE HEADING TO THE WORLD SERIES! #OnePursuit #STAYINTHEFIGHT pic.twitter.com/qjtRyCu1yJ \u2014 Kyley Schultz (@KyleyBSchultz) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cI am so happy I\u2019m dancing,\u201d said Dan Smith, who also high-fived and hugged the people he\u2019s gotten to know in the seats near his standing-room spot beneath the press box in Section 313. \u201cI remember standing here in early May and saying, \u2018The math says we can\u2019t make the playoffs.\u2019 I\u2019ve never been more happy to have been wrong.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJust after midnight, two gentlemen who will remain anonymous lifted up their T-shirts and bumped bellies on the left field concourse, because what better way to celebrate a World Series berth?\n\n\u201cCome on, who knows when this will happen again?\u201d one of them asked rhetorically, to which the appropriate response is, \u201cHopefully within the next 86 years.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHere it is. The final out. Washington @Nationals win the National League Pennant and a trip to the WORLD SERIES!!! #stayinthefight pic.twitter.com/N88wByIlIo \u2014 Jeremy Art (@jeremyart) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cThis ameliorates everything,\u201d original season-ticket holder Marlene Koenig said of the Nationals\u2019 playoff history, which included four defeats in four trips to the NLDS before this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve conquered all the demons. \u2026 You have to invest in a team, win or lose. You can\u2019t just be there for the highlights. You learn about life, and you learn about grief. You have to go through the highs and the lows. This was such a surprise, with the wild-card and beating the Dodgers, it\u2019s been surreal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKoenig added: \u201cEveryone can chill out and get drunk tonight, for what, the fourth time in three weeks?\"\n\nWith six days off before the start of the World Series, there\u2019s plenty of time to soak this latest moment in.\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "Game 4 featured a \u201cBaby Shark\u201d singalong and, for at least one longtime D.C. baseball fan, an early birthday present.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
