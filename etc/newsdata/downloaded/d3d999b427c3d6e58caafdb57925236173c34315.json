The company, best known for its search engine and phone software, has branched into hardware in recent years as manufacturers seek to secure a future in wireless accessories and the smart home.\n\nThe Pixel 4 comes with a dual camera on the rear of the phone, with a distinctive camera bump similar to the design of Apple's new iPhone.\n\nThe company also revealed a new way of controlling a smartphone, dubbed \u201cmotion sense\u201d. The technology uses a radar chip in the smartphone to let users control it using gestures in the air, with controls for skipping songs, snoozing an alarm or silencing calls.\n\nGoogle's smartphone is unlikely to dent Apple's sales, however. The company has less than 1pc of the global smartphone market and even in the US, where it has secured deals with operators, Google has a 2.5pc share, compared to Apple's more than 50pc. Many of its upgrades to the Pixel phones appeared incremental, with marginally upgraded screen and camera technology.\n\nThe iPhone maker's own sales for its new models have reportedly been strong. In September, Apple released its first \"Pro\" iPhone as part of a trio of devices. It also cut its own prices, starting its iPhone 11 model at \u00a3729. The company has reportedly told suppliers to target the top end of expectations, targeting around 75 million iPhone sales for the next three months.\n\nAnalysts predicted Google\u2019s device is likely to clash with rival manufacturers developing smartphones using Google-made Android operating software. Other companies, such as Samsung and Huawei, largely rely on Google\u2019s Android system.\n\nQuestions remain over how serious Google is about creating a major hardware business, having acquired a large chunk of Taiwanese firm HTC's smartphone assets in 2018, or whether it prefers to use the business to showcase its smartphone software.\n\nBen Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, said: \u201cWhat will be interesting is how much Google is willing to spend to raise the consumer consciousness of its Pixel smartphones this time around. I can\u2019t help wondering whether there are huge internal tensions at Google about how much to compete with other Android phone makers such as Samsung who drive so much volume for the wider Google business.\u201d\n\nGoogle also revealed a new version of its smart speaker, branded as Nest, the smart home technology company Google merged into its devices division last year. The company added Stadia, its online-only gaming service, would be launching in November.", "description": "Google has unveiled a new smartphone that can be controlled by moving\u00a0hands in mid-air\u00a0as the search giant presents its latest alternative to Apple\u2019s iPhone.", "authors": ["Matthew Field"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/reh1NoDFNJR6Is3CgHnrcQ--~B/aD02MjQ7dz05OTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/f3bea5a647747022db6963e632c54f98", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
