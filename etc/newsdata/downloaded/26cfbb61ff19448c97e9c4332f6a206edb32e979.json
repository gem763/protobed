REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tom Hanks, one of Hollywood\u2019s most beloved actors, is to add another honor to his name with a lifetime achievement award from the organizers of the Golden Globe awards.\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) said on Tuesday it would present the prolific actor and producer with its Cecil B. DeMille award at the Golden Globes ceremony in Beverly Hills on Jan. 5.\n\nThe boyish-looking Hanks, now 63, made his movie breakthrough in \u201cBig\u201d in 1988, playing a teenager who wakes up to find himself in the body of an adult.\n\nHe went on to win back-to-back Oscars and Golden Globes in 1994 and 1995 for his roles in AIDS drama \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d and comedy \u201cForrest Gump.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor more than three decades, he\u2019s captivated audiences with rich and playful characters that we\u2019ve grown to love and admire,\u201d HFPA president Lorenzo Soria said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs compelling as he is on the silver screen, he\u2019s equally so behind the camera as a writer, producer and director.\u201d\n\nHanks\u2019 next movie appearance will be in November as the much loved U.S. children\u2019s television host Mister Rogers, in \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\u201d\n\nHe also starred in more than 80 other movies, including \u201cSleepless in Seattle,\u201d and \u201cPrivate Ryan\u201d and was the voice of cowboy Woody in the \u201cToy Story\u201d animated movie franchise.\n\nThe Cecil B. DeMille award is given annually to an actor, director or producer who has made a lasting impact on the film industry. Past recipients include Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Harrison Ford.", "description": "Tom Hanks, one of Hollywood's most beloved actors, is to add another honor to his name with a lifetime achievement award from the organizers of the Golden Globe awards.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433339516&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N14I", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
