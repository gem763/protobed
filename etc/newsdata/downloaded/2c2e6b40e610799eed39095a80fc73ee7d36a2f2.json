Expect Boston ferns, peace lilies and snake plants, all of which are said to have productivity-inducing properties.\n\n(Image: Simone Morciano/ thejoyofplants.)\n\nGuests can also make use of 'soundwave therapy' to sharpen their focus, while the hotel mini bar will have a plant-based fuel station with power snacks and a CBD oil shot.\n\nThe Romance Suite , designed by Nik Southern, will offer soft pink lighting and a botanical canopy over the bed for a charming setting, as well as an exclusive 'love-boosting cocktail'.\n\n(Image: Simone Morciano/ thejoyofplants.)\n\nAs for The Tranquil Suite ? Designed by Mr Plant Greek, expect an indoor jungle packed with tropical plants to create the ultimate oasis of calm. Bromeliads, monsteras, deliciosa and obliqua plants reign supreme here, while the dedicated plant meditation zone and 'clean sleep' zone are sure to help you rejuvenate.\n\n(Image: Simone Morciano/ thejoyofplants.)\n\nThe idea is to offer 'forest bathing' - when you spend time in a forest to relax and focus on your wellbeing - in the heart of the bustling city of London.\n\n(Image: Simone Morciano/ thejoyofplants.)\n\nIt comes after research by Thejoyofplants revealed that third of people will spend less than 17 minutes outside per day during the winter - despite 39 per cent admitting that spending more time in nature would make them happier.\n\nWant to book a stay?\n\nThe indoor plant jungle hotel will be open for bookings from 19th October until 10 November 2019. To book your stay, email thejoyofplants@lockeliving.com .\n\nPrices start from \u00a3120 a night but all bookings made directly through this email will automatically receive a 15 per cent discount.\n\n(Image: Simone Morciano/ thejoyofplants.)\n\nChanel De Kock, UK Manager at Thejoyofplants.co.uk says: \"Hotels have started to feature beautiful plant installations in communal areas for a number of years now but the botanical installations seem to end there.\n\n\"We know that people are inspired when they travel and take inspiration from the places they stay in, so this is a unique opportunity to stimulate guests with biophilic design.\n\n\"People are slowly waking up to the fact that the humble houseplant is so much more than just a decorative or design object \u2013 they are a powerful source of life that give so much more than they take.\u201d", "description": "A UK hotel has transformed its chic suites into indoor jungles and we're already obsessed", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Simone Morciano", "Thejoyofplants."], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20576702.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Oliver-Living-Room.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
