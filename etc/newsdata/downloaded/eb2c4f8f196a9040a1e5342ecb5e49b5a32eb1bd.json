That matched analysts average profit estimate of 40.16 billion rupees.\n\nRevenue from operations rose 9.8% as the company benefited from large deals worth $2.8 billion during the quarter.\n\nBigger rival Tata Consultancy Services, which reported second quarter earnings on Thursday, warned of a challenging second half as a slowing global economy forced many of its clients to cut back spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal and Derek Francis; Writing by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Maju Samuel and Deepa Babington)", "description": "BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's second-largest software services exporter, Infosys Ltd, on Friday raised the low end of its revenue forecast for the year on upbeat demand for its digital services from Western clients.
