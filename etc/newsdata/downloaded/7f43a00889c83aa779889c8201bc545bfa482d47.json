Trump\u2019s problem was an indicted Turkish-Iranian gold trader named Reza Zarrab. More precisely, the problem was Zarrab\u2019s lawyer, the president\u2019s close friend Rudy Giuliani.\n\nInvestigators suspected Zarrab was working on behalf of the Turkish government\u2019s state-owned bank Halkbank as part of a massive scheme to funnel billions of dollars into Iran in contravention of American economic sanctions. They wanted Zarrab to spill what he knew. Giuliani was in a panic.\n\nTrump bluntly asked Tillerson to pressure the Department of Justice into ending its investigation of Zarrab. Tillerson flatly refused, even raising his concerns about the criminality of Trump\u2019s request with then-Chief of Staff John Kelly. And yet, faced with a clear order to obstruct a federal investigation, neither Tillerson nor Kelly took any steps to report Trump\u2019s request.", "description": "Tillerson says the President broke the law.
