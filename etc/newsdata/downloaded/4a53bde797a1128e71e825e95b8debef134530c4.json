No. 5 LSU and the Gators have three each while new No. 1 Alabama and No. 3 Georgia each must face a pair of top 10 opponents plus No. 25 Texas A&M.;\n\nThe other, non-SEC teams in the top 10 collectively have two comparable regular season matchups left: No. 4 Ohio State vs. No. 8 Wisconsin and No. 6 Oklahoma against No. 11 Texas.\n\nAt least entering October, it gives room to brag for a league that has won nine national titles since 2006 _ starting with a string of seven straight.\n\nNot that the SEC ever needs much encouragement in that regard.\n\n\u201cOf course, the SEC is the best conference in football, hands down,\u201d Auburn defensive end Marlon Davidson said. \u201cAny other team can say this and that, this league is better or whatever, but nah man, nothing compares to the SEC no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s top teams have indeed won some big head-to-head nonconference games, like Auburn-Oregon, Georgia-Notre Dame and LSU-Texas. Now, the coming gauntlet should soon start to whittle the league\u2019s list of national contenders.\n\nNone of the top SEC teams have easy paths to the championship game in Atlanta. Or to the playoffs, though to this point there\u2019s still a solid possibility of a pair of teams making it two years after Alabama beat Georgia for the national title.\n\nOther teams like No. 2 Clemson , the defending national champion, Ohio State, Oklahoma and Wisconsin are still firmly in the mix as the nation\u2019s top team.\n\nNone face the SEC-style gauntlet the rest of the way.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the roads the league\u2019s top 10 teams must travel still:\n\nALABAMA\n\n_Road Ahead: Alabama has had an easy journey so far, rising to the top spot thanks to a series of easy wins over unranked opponents. It gets tougher from here. After an open date, the Tide visits Texas A&M;, hosts LSU on Nov. 9 and then closes the regular season against Auburn in the Iron Bowl.\n\n_Challenges: A defense currently starting four freshmen has plenty of room _ and need _ for improvement. The Tide allowed 476 total yards and 31 points against Mississippi.\n\nGEORGIA\n\n_Road Ahead: The World\u2019s Largest Cocktail Party against Florida in Jacksonville; at Auburn and home against Texas A&M.;\n\n_Challenges: Even with veteran QB Jake Fromm, the passing game hasn\u2019t been explosive. The running game and run defense have been the league\u2019s best, though, and Fromm hasn\u2019t thrown an interception.\n\nLSU\n\n_Road Ahead: Hosts Florida and Auburn and Texas A&M; but must travel to Alabama, which has won the last eight meetings.\n\n_Challenges: Like Alabama, LSU hasn\u2019t been as dominant as usual on defense, especially against the pass. The Tigers, who still must face Tide quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, rank 69th in FBS in pass defense.\n\nAUBURN\n\nRoad Ahead: With two wins over ranked opponents already, the Tigers may have the hardest remaining schedule of any of the playoff contenders. At Florida and LSU, home against Georgia and Alabama.\n\nChallenges: As if the schedule wasn\u2019t enough, quarterback Bo Nix is still a freshman even if he mostly hasn\u2019t been playing like one.\n\nBefore the season, Gus Malzahn put Auburn\u2019s schedule up on the board for his players. \u201cI told the guys, \u2018OK, here\u2019s the big picture, all right? But that\u2019s the last time we\u2019re going to do that,\u2019\u201d the Tigers coach said.\n\nFLORIDA\n\n_Road Ahead: Auburn at LSU and against Georgia. At least only one of those games is in the opponent\u2019s stadium.\n\n_Challenges: QB Kyle Trask has filled in more than capably since the injury to Feleipe Franks, but he\u2019ll be tested even more. His starts have come against struggling Tennessee and Towson.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Southeastern Conference seems to be in good playoff position with five teams ranked in the top 10.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Zenor"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/mississippi_alabama_football_65735_c0-185-4434-2770_s1770x1032.jpg?4254e437294b281636c24658d270feaf0b4eee26"}
