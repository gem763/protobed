United severs ties with broadcast partner FloSports", "language": "en", "text": "In a terse statement, the organization said: \u201cD.C. United will no longer be distributing our match telecasts through FloSports. Announcements on broadcast plans for the 2020 season and beyond will be made in due course.\u201d\n\nThe separation comes three days before FloSports was scheduled to show United\u2019s regular season finale against FC Cincinnati at Audi Field. Instead, United will show the match on its website for no charge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll playoff games will appear on MLS\u2019s national TV platforms: ESPN, Fox Sports and Univision.\n\nUnited officials said they did not want to comment. Messages left for FloSports executives were not immediately returned.\n\nBefore United made the surprising move in partnering with FloSports last winter, the matches over the years appeared on cable channels Home Team Sports and Comcast SportsNet (now known as NBC Sports Washington) and NewsChannel 8 (now WJLA 24/7 News).\n\nFloSports carried more than half of United\u2019s matches. Neither the company nor the team revealed the number of subscribers, who paid between $5.99 and $8.99 per month. As part of the subscription, viewers also gained access to various other sports, such as wrestling and gymnastics.\n\nThings did not start well: After a flawed first broadcast, FloSports provided an apology and refunds.\n\nIt is unclear what direction United will turn for local broadcast rights next season and beyond.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nAD", "description": "Team's relationship with the streaming partner ends after one troubled year.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
