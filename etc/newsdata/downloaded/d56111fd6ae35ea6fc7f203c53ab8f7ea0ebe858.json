Use every rule in the book. Don't focus on fines.\n\nThose are the lessons from Europe's long-running antitrust battle with many of the world's largest tech companies \u2014 a playbook for U.S. officials as Washington restarts its own investigations into the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook.\n\nSince 2016, the European Union and individual EU countries have levied more than \u20ac20 billion in fines and other financial penalties against Silicon Valley for competition, antitrust and state-aid abuses.\n\nApple was hit over its tax dealings in Ireland. Google faced three rounds of charges against its global online empire. Facebook was judged to have unfairly used people's data. Investigations are also underway into Apple and Amazon. The companies deny any wrongdoing.\n\nThis backlog of cases and decisions has made Brussels, not Washington, the testing ground for how to bring antitrust charges against Big Tech, a role that Europe has cultivated as part of its wider effort to become the world's policeman for the digital world (outside of China).\n\nIt also has sharpened Europe's officials to what does, and does not, work to curb the power of a small stable of tech firms whose dominance over large parts of the digital economy is outpacing authorities' ability to keep up.\n\n\"We need to address the power of digital platforms\" \u2014 Margrethe Vestager\n\nThat includes the failure of blockbuster fines \u2014 often worth billions of euros \u2014 to keep well-capitalized companies in check because many can easily shrug off these hefty levies with little, if any, shareholder pushback. While some European politicians have repeatedly called to break up tech giants, neither the Commission nor national governments have ever gone that far in their competition cases.\n\nIn response, EU competition officials like Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's antitrust chief, have looked to personalize often complicated cases to woo consumers increasingly wary of Big Tech. They've also rejiggered the legal landscape to give regulators greater leeway in how they take on tech firms that often straddle multiple industries \u2014 blending existing competition rules with other consumer and privacy protections.\n\n\"There's no doubt Europe has led the way,\" said Ioannis Lianos, the newly nominated head of the Greek Competition Authority, before he took over his new role. \"There's now a lot of pressure in the U.S. to act.\"\n\nU.S. and European officials regularly meet to share ideas, with Vestager traveling to the U.S. earlier this year, and her American counterparts similarly visiting Brussels in 2019. Yet neither side has any formal cooperation mechanisms in place to share documents or findings on completed or ongoing investigations into tech firms, according to officials with knowledge of the matter.\n\nDespite Europe offering a precooked recipe for American authorities \u2014 the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and a number of state attorneys general have opened, or are mulling, several antitrust tech investigations \u2014 merely transferring what worked in Brussels to Washington is not a slam dunk.\n\nIn the EU, the European Commission acts as both judge and jury, investigating and then deciding on potential wrongdoing (companies only then can appeal to the bloc's highest court). By contrast, U.S. regulators must put their claims before independent judges, who have so far taken a more lenient view toward dominant companies.\n\n\"There are core institutional differences that imply the results will be different,\" said Marianela L\u00f3pez-Galdos, global competition counsel at the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a Washington DC-based trade body whose members include Facebook and Google.\n\nShe who dares, wins\n\nDespite these differences, one thing is clear: When bringing antitrust charges against Big Tech, it pays to make it personal.\n\nNo regulator has done that more than Vestager, Europe's current competition commissioner. She has become the region's poster child for pushing back against Big Tech \u2014 and has connected with average citizens through selfies at press conferences, high-profile interviews and other tactics to win support for often complicated cases.\n\nVestager invited a television crew from Vice, the hipster U.S. news channel, to trail her as she made her first antitrust decision against a U.S. tech company. She also has been repeatedly named as one of the world's most influential people by Time magazine, portraying herself as an avid knitter with a middle-finger statue in her office to show off her steeliness.\n\n\"We need to address the power of digital platforms,\" the Danish politician told an audience in Paris earlier this year during a speech in which she referenced Leonard Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter. \"It\u2019s especially important that we protect the opportunities for competition that do still exist.\"\n\nVestager's term ends on October 31, but she is tipped for another high-profile job \u2014 which could but has not been confirmed to include responsibility for competition \u2014 in the new Commission due to take over on November 1.\n\nWhen she took over the competition portfolio in Brussels in late 2014, several landmark competition cases, most notably against Google and Gazprom, the Russian oil giant, had stalled after years of cut-throat lobbying aimed at her predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia.\n\nYet in just over two years, Vestager had slapped the search giant with a \u20ac2.42 billion fine linked to abuses in some of its search services (the company is appealing). Soon afterward, she opened two separate investigations, and subsequently issued record financial penalties against Google, while pushing back against others like Apple, Amazon and Facebook for other abuses.\n\nHer overtly public standoffs with Big Tech have won her both plaudits and rebukes from U.S. officials, including Donald Trump. Vestager has parlayed her regulatory actions into a prominent global role within policymaker circles over how much control tech companies should have over everyday life.\n\nU.S. politicians like Elizabeth Warren and, ironically, Donald Trump \u2014 both of whom have called for antitrust investigations into Big Tech \u2014 have followed her playbook in personalizing their fight against Silicon Valley to win over hardcore supporters.\n\n\"Vestager was the beginning of the techlash,\" said a senior U.S. tech executive, whose company has had repeated dealings with both U.S. and European competition authorities. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of ongoing regulatory cases on both sides of the Atlantic. \"The U.S. is poised to follow Europe's and Vestager's lead.\"\n\nNew era of data antitrust\n\nOthers in Europe are taking a more drastic approach \u2014 pushing the boundaries of antitrust by revamping competition rules for the 21st century.\n\nWith most of existing legislation created well before smartphones, social media companies and e-commerce giants even existed, regulators are applying existing rules in new ways to investigate companies that span everything from digital apps and Instagram feeds to online shopping and mobile search.\n\nThat's particularly true within EU member states, where national competition authorities have often been in the vanguard of pushing what constitutes anti-competitive behavior and what changes in corporate activity are necessary to protect consumers.\n\n\"If we're not careful, by the time competition authorities act, the world will be divided up between these companies.\" \u2014 Jacques Cr\u00e9mer, antitrust expert\n\nThey've also moved more quickly than their EU counterparts to impose so-called interim measures, or early-stage sanctions before full antitrust cases are completed, to allow smaller rivals the chance to compete while regulators decide if companies have broken antitrust rules.\n\n\"We have to update our regulation,\" said Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, a professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who provided expert commentary for a recent antitrust report by the Dutch competition authority. \"We have compartmentalized our society within different legal frameworks. But that's not how these companies operate.\"\n\nEnter Andreas Mundt, head of Germany's federal cartel office.\n\nUsing the country's long-standing data protection standards, he has pushed the boundaries between existing competition rules and Europe's ever-expanding privacy legislation. Mundt's goal has been to show that Big Tech's harvesting of reams of people's personal information gives it an unfair advantage against smaller players that don't have ready access to such information.\n\nEarlier this year, the German official ordered Facebook to stop sharing digital data on its users between online platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram, unless people gave their express consent. The social networking giant is appealing that decision. It was one of the first antitrust rulings that focused on a company's control of a wealth of personal information as a potential competition issue.\n\nOther regulators have taken notice.\n\nWhen Vestager opened an investigation into Amazon earlier this year, her focus was on whether the company's collection of data from merchants using its platform represented an unfair advantage. Now, the European Commission is thinking about tailoring its antitrust rules specifically to deal with such data sharing.\n\nAnd even U.S. regulators \u2014 who cannot rely on domestic privacy rules to target Big Tech, mostly because they do not exist \u2014 are also focusing their new investigations on whether the activities of digital platforms, including their collection and use of people's data, may represent an unfair advantage.\n\nAuthorities \"must be creative and act much faster,\" said Jacques Cr\u00e9mer, an antitrust expert who co-authored a recent review of Europe\u2019s digital competition policies sponsored by the Commission.\n\n\"The companies aren't going to stop,\" he added. \"If we're not careful, by the time competition authorities act, the world will be divided up between these companies.\"", "description": "Europe\u2019s long experience regulating Silicon Valley offers plenty of lessons \u2014 including on what to avoid.", "authors": ["Mark Scott", "Thibault Larger", "Simon Van Dorpe"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-855410518-1200x628.jpg"}
