Harris recently embarked on a statewide bus tour and was the first in the field to run ads in Iowa. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe former vice president is statistically tied with Warren, who is at 23 percent. Pete Buttigieg, meanwhile, moved into third place, with 12 percent of those surveyed saying they\u2019d back him for president.\n\nBiden\u2019s 8-point gain since July is a sign he\u2019s rebuilding the losses he\u2019s faced in the first-in-the-nation primary caucus state as he struggled to catch up organizationally with Warren, who began laying down infrastructure in the state in January. Biden has ramped up his visits to Iowa and increased his level of staffing to become one of the largest campaign organizations on the ground. Warren though, has steadily gained support and is widely considered to have the best organization statewide.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, the race is still fluid but it\u2019s also very close,\u201d said Jeff Link, co-founder of Focus on Rural America. \u201cOnce again, organization matters. It will be imperative for Biden to match the Warren organization to maintain this lead. And, rural counties could make the difference because they are harder to organize. That\u2019s why taking Trump to task on biofuels and standing up to Big Oil could tip the scales.\u201d\n\n", "description": "In July, Harris was tied with Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden for first place in the state.", "authors": ["Natasha Korecki"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b2/66/4a9fb109470f860416b2c9c5da8c/190918-kamala-harris-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
