After officially retiring in 2018, he's enjoying his woodworking shed, and also travels and does some consulting work on the side.\n\nBusiness Insider is looking for your retirement stories.

I bought a shed \u2014 a man-cave, as you might describe it,\" said Brown.\n\nHe spent about $7,000 on the shed itself. \"Then, I added an air conditioner, a refrigerator with a six pack, and a coffee maker,\" he said. A $3,000 collection of woodworking tools completed his new workspace.\n\n\"The first few days I really spent doing nothing but going over to that shed, looking around, and thinking, 'Hm, I wonder what I'll even bother making,'\" said Brown. \"I was perfectly happy for the first couple of days taking naps.\"\n\nBut that just didn't fit his personality. \"After a week or so, you do get tired of it,\" he said.\n\nSo, he got to work in the shed making things. \"I've made a table and I've made two bird houses to national wildlife federation standards,\" he said.\n\nWoodworking keeps Brown from living up to his friends' expectations in retirement. It not only keeps him from napping, but also says that it gives him a little alone time while his wife is out with friends or doing volunteer work.\n\nHis best advice for other \"type A\" personalities approaching retirement is to plan to do something you enjoy. \"Just make sure you have something outside of retirement, no matter what it is,\" he says. \"It can be just somebody go to lunch with. It can be just something to do.\"\n\nFor over a year in retirement, Brown has proved the naysayers wrong \u2014 he's enjoying his woodworking shed between trips with his wife ... though he admits to still squeezing in some consulting work on the side.", "description": "Bill Brown retired at 65, and people thought he'd 'go crazy' in retirement.
