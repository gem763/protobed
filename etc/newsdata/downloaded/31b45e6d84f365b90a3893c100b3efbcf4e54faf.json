The lid full of petrol only added to the combustion.\n\nMr Schmitz said: 'I wish I'd thought this through before. I had no idea that this could happen. Luckily the damage was only contained on the lawn. If I had been standing closer or the table had hit me it could have been fatal.'\n\nThe handyman was shocked at the damage created by the explosion but he said the infestation has now been solved\n\nHe revealed that he is still clearing up the mess and will need to replant his lawn, but added the roach infestation has now been solved.\n\nLocal police revealed they have launched an investigation into the incident after examining the footage but said they did not envisage any charges being made for endangering lives.\n\nThe video, which appeared on Twitter, attracted many reactions on social media.\n\nOne person wrote: 'If you're going to do something foolish at least move the dogs to safety first.'\n\nAnother user commented: 'I enjoy how he looks inside the house to check if his wife heard that. \u201cNothing happened!\u201d'", "description": "Cesar Schmitz decided to set fire to the nest when cockroaches invaded his garden in En\u00e9as Marques, Brazil.
