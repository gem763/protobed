Add The Note as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Note news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIt may be one of the biggest gambles -- in terms of dollars as well as signals -- of former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nHis campaign has now pronounced itself open to the support of super PACs. Campaign aides are framing it as the only choice \"in this time of crisis in our politics,\" with untold millions already freely flowing to President Donald Trump's reelection effort.\n\nAFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThis is the kind of commitment to winning that many prominent Biden supporters have been looking for.\n\nIt is also the kind of commitment to winning that many prominent Biden detractors have been waiting for.\n\n\"It's a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system which enriches wealthy donors and leaves the working class behind,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement.\n\nWith rumblings of unhappiness about the current field, and signs that other centrist candidates could gain traction, this shows Biden acting in favor of practicality over purity.\n\nBut for a candidate seeking to distinguish himself from the \"swamp,\" it could rejuvenate a debate over whether the former vice president is part of the solution or part of the problem.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nFormer Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are set to speak Friday at the Baltimore funeral service for Rep. Elijah Cummings, the civil rights leader and beloved elder of the Democratic Party who died last week.\n\nGreg Nash/Getty Images\n\nSeveral other nationally-prominent Democrats will also offer remarks, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former NAACP leader and Maryland Rep. Kweisi Mfume.\n\nTrump is not planning to attend, nor has the White House announced if someone from his administration will be present.\n\nCummings and Trump, of course, often tangled publicly over issues including the treatment of immigrants at the border and Cummings' oversight work related to the president's finances.\n\nCummings called President Trump a racist after his attacks on four freshman congresswomen of color. Trump aimed his brand of personal and vindictive politics back at Cummings' hometown referring to Baltimore a \"rat and rodent infested mess.\"\n\nIn the last few years, the Democratic Party has seen both a call for a generational shift of power and as well as a renewed appreciation for leaders with a historical perspective. Cummings, for example, could talk personally about living through segregation and experiencing racially-motivated violence. In the last few years, he provided a vital perspective and wisdom for his party as it navigates how to respond to this president and this White House.\n\nThe TIP with Chris Donato\n\nThere was good news and bad news among the Democratic contenders for president on Thursday.\n\nIn the morning, Quinnipiac University released a poll showing Sen. Amy Klobuchar grabbing 3% among Democratic/Democratic-leaning independent voters, which, according to an ABC News analysis, means the senator from Minnesota will be on the November debate stage. To make the November debate stage, candidates had to receive at least 3% in four polls and meet a donor threshold \u2013 her campaign had previously announced she had met the donor threshold.\n\nHer campaign had raised over $2 million since last week's debate and after securing the debate-qualifying poll on Thursday, her campaign manager, Justin Buoen, said they would \"use this momentum to continue building on our strong grassroots operation as we head into Iowa and New Hampshire.\"\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe news on Thursday afternoon was very different for Rep. Tim Ryan. He announced that he was \"withdrawing from the presidential campaign\" and would \"run for re-election for my Congressional seat.\" The Ohio congressman had been campaigning since making his entry into the race with an announcement on ABC's \"The View\" back in April, but he failed to garner attention from voters. His low poll and fundraising numbers prevented him from qualifying for the third and fourth debate stages.\n\nONE MORE THING\n\nIt has been nearly a month since legislators released the whistleblower complaint that prompted multiple congressional committees' probes into President Donald Trump and the administration's actions in Ukraine. In the time since that complaint came to light, it's been rapid-fire witnesses on Capitol Hill -- but the whistleblower has remained largely out of the picture.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" Podcast.
