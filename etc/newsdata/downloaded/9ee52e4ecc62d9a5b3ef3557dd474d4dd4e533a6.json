Duncan Hunter, who is running for re-election while under indictment on corruption charges, said Larry Wilske, a retired Navy SEAL and Republican also running in Hunter\u2019s San Diego-area district.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Wilske said Issa told him he will run. Wilske plans to drop out and support Issa.\n\nIssa\u2019s entry will make the district near the U.S.-Mexico border one of the most closely watched races in the country.\n\nHunter and Issa could wind up going head-to-head under California\u2019s primary system which allows the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, to compete in the general election.\n\nThe move puts Hunter in an increasingly uncomfortable position, given Issa\u2019s deep pockets and reputation as a chief antagonist against former President Barack Obama, which could play well in one of Southern California\u2019s last staunchly Republican districts.\n\nHunter narrowly won re-election against Ammar Campa-Najjar, a young Democrat who came within 3.4 percentage points of winning the seat in November in his first run for Congress.\n\nCampa-Najjar said Issa joining the field of candidates \u201cjust highlights the fact that Hunter is vulnerable and we\u2019re viable, and that Washington insiders are scrambling to find somebody who could effectively challenge our campaign.\u201d\n\nIssa, a former nine-term congressman, who made his fortune through a car-alarm company, formed an exploratory committee last month and was widely known to be considering a run. He retired from his long stint in Congress before the 2018 election in a neighboring district that he narrowly won two years earlier.\n\nIssa\u2019s decision comes after his confirmation hearing to be director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency was delayed indefinitely.\n\nWilske said Issa, 65, is a safer bet that Hunter\u2019s district will remain in Republican hands, and his many years in the House pave the way for him to become a ranking member on committees.\n\n\u201cHe is rock solid and has enough financially to lock this down,\u201d Wilske said.\n\nEl Cajon Mayor Bill Wells, who also was running for Hunter\u2019s seat, said he too plans to bow out and back Issa.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the one in the best position to win and get something done,\u201d Wells said. \u201cWe need to get back to the business of having a presence in Washington.\u201d\n\nHunter has said he has no plans to step down despite being indicted. He is scheduled to be tried in January for allegedly siphoning campaign money for personal use.\n\nThe 42-year-old Marine combat veteran is also being challenged by Republican Carl DeMaio, a radio host and former San Diego city councilman with broad name recognition.\n\nThe San Diego County Republican Party is scheduled to consider an endorsement Oct. 14.\n\nRepublicans have a big advantage in voter registration in California\u2019s 50th district, which covers east San Diego County and a small part of southern Riverside County.\n\nHunter won a sixth term last year, barely two months after he and his wife were charged with using more than $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses ranging from groceries to golf trips and family vacations. Margaret Hunter has pleaded guilty to one corruption count and agreed to cooperate with investigators.\n\nHunter, whose father represented the district in Congress for 28 years, has pleaded not guilty and framed the charges as political attack by prosecutors sympathetic to Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential bid.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former Congressman Darrell poised to end political retirement to take on fellow GOP lawmaker Duncan Hunter who is under indictment on corruption charges", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Julie Watson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/Darrell_Issa-Congress_51565.jpg-f5e4c_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
