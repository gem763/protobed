She declined President Donald Trump's invitation to the White House upon the US team's tournament victory \u2013 or the \u201cf***ing White House\u201d as she famously put it \u2013 later adding the caveat that she would only go if she were being inaugurated.\n\nRapinoe was one of the first US athletes to join NFL player Colin Kaepernick in protesting police brutality by kneeling during the US national anthem. When the Star-Spangled Banner was played during the World Cup this summer, she stood with her arms by her sides rather than holding her hand over her heart, as is customary, and did not sing. She is also one of 28 players currently suing governing body US Soccer for equal pay.\n\nRead more: Who is Megan Rapinoe, the US football star who'll snub Trump's White House invitation?\n\nOn the men's list, last year's winner Luka Modric failed to make the cut but Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and UEFA player of the year Virgil van Dijk are among the 30 nominations, as are Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling, Mo Salah, Eden Hazard and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Van Dijk is the bookmakers' current favourite to win.\n\nThe ceremony crowning the winners will be held in Paris on 2 December. Four awards will be handed out on the night, with the best men's and women's player honoured, alongside the Kopa Trophy for under-21s and the Yachine Trophy for goalkeepers.", "description": "Also on the list is the inaugural winner of the award, Norway's Ada Hegerberg.
