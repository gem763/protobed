And to be fair, this reasoning has often been used as a cover for a hurried or unhappy departure.\n\nBut Clarke deserves credit for being so candid about the reasons he plans to retire. It underlines how successful executives almost always have a strong support team behind them, be that their partner, their children or their extended family.\n\nSometimes these people are the sounding board an executive can return home to every night. Sometimes, as in Clarke\u2019s case, a partner will carry an enormous weight to maintain the executive\u2019s work/life balance.\n\nThere may be an argument that societal changes should force companies to look at better supporting the support networks of their executives.\n\nOur October cover story subject, Incitec Pivot chief executive Jeanne Johns, is another who is upfront about how she could never have achieved all she has without her extremely supportive husband, Marc. His willingness to move to Australia so Johns could come out of retirement and pursue her first job as chief executive of a listed company is a neat example of this.\n\nOf course, successful executives have also leaned heavily on their support networks. And clearly, these executives are well remunerated for the sacrifices they and their families make.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there may be an argument that societal changes \u2013 such as rising mental health concerns, the challenges created by ageing populations and the generally faster pace of life \u2013 should force companies to look at how they might better support the support networks of their top executives.\n\nMight boards need to consider offering executives sabbaticals, leaves of absence or even a more flexible form of family leave, for example? Should boards look for ways to encourage executives to work in more flexible ways?\n\nMany companies have encouraged this for their staff, but it often seems executives are unwilling or unable to take up these opportunities. That said, it was interesting to hear recently that CSL executive Paul Perreault, who spends a punishing two-thirds of the year on the road, works from home when he\u2019s at his family base in the US.\n\nThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions here, of course. A CEO working in their home town will of course face different work/life challenges to an executive who relocates from interstate and overseas.\n\nBut if, as Mike Clarke\u2019s experience shows, there is typically a great partnership behind a great executive, then surely a board that wants to get the best out of an executive will think about how it can also support that partnership.", "description": "Organisations may need to look for more flexible work options that cater to the families of their top executives if they want the best from them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4082%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_764%2C$y_10/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e7f598af2269841d846a2640e214bb1d3c5a6cd3", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
