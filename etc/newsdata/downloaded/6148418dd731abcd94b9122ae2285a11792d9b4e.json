The strategy would not result in rate increases for its customers, PG&E said.\n\n\u201cUnder the Plan we filed today, we will meet our commitment to fairly compensate wildfire victims and we will emerge from Chapter 11 financially sound and able to continue meeting California\u2019s clean energy goals,\u201d CEO and President Bill Johnson said in a statement.\n\nPG&E is under deadline pressure to emerge from bankruptcy by June 2020 in order to participate in a state wildfire fund to help California\u2019s major utilities pay out future claims as climate change makes wildfires across the U.S. West more frequent and more destructive.\n\nThe plan must be approved by state regulators.\n\nSan Francisco leaders further complicated the restructuring plan by offering on Sunday to buy pieces of PG&E\u2019s assets for $2.5 billion so the city can run parts of the power system on its own.\n\nMayor London Breed and City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement that the offer was \u201ccompetitive, fair and equitable\u201d and would lead to financial stability for the beleaguered investor-owned utility.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to positive, collaborative discussions with PG&E on this critical issue,\u201d the statement issued Sunday said. \u201cThroughout this process we will protect the best interests of our city as we strive toward the independent energy future that San Francisco deserves.\u201d\n\nPG&E said in a statement that it doesn\u2019t believe the sale would be \u201cin the best interests of our customers and stakeholders.\u201d About 452,000 of the utility\u2019s 5.4 million electric customers are in San Francisco.\n\nSan Francisco, where PG&E was founded more than a century ago, began examining options for taking over pieces of the utility after it filed for bankruptcy protection. The city isn\u2019t looking to buy any part of PG&E\u2019s gas system.\n\nA May report by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission said public ownership of the electric grid could help the city become carbon neutral by 2030 and stabilize electricity rates.\n\nThe city already has its own power system but relies on PG&E to deliver electricity to many customers.\n\nMoney for the purchase would come from a bond that voters agreed last year the city could use. State and federal regulators would need to sign off on any deal.\n\nCities previously could use eminent domain to take ownership of assets at fair market value. But under a new law passed by state lawmakers in July, the California Public Utilities Commission will get to consider other costs in deciding any local government\u2019s purchase of utility assets.\n\nBreed, along with San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, told lawmakers that expanding regulators\u2019 oversight would infringe on cities\u2019 authority to provide electric service in the future.", "description": "PG&E Corp. released a plan Monday to offer nearly $18 billion to victims, insurance companies and cities and local governments in Northern California...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB958_pgE011_ZG_20190114111615.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
