Not all flights scheduled on the Max will be canceled, though. The airline says it will use other aircraft for some of the flights. But some flights not scheduled on the Max jets may also be canceled.\n\nUnited Airlines had also delayed the Max return date through Dec. 19.\n\nMax jets have been grounded since March after two accidents that killed a total of 346 people.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
