'The information is that he's going to leave the All Blacks.\n\nToronto Wolfpack head coach Brian McDermott wants a high profile signing for his side\n\n'His agent, I would say, has probably been in contact with many clubs.\n\n'If he is leaving the All Blacks, I am confident there are two or three NRL clubs that are in the batting to secure his services.'\n\nAccording to a newspaper report in Australia, Williams is weighing up an offer of a two-year deal from Toronto worth around \u00a34.8million which would make him the highest-paid rugby player of all time in either code.\n\nThe Wolfpack are funded by Australian mining and resources billionaire David Argyle, who has previously spoken about snaring Williams as their marquee signing.", "description": "Toronto have confirmed they are in fresh talks with All Black Sonny Bill Williams.
