But His Royal Highness made a very special gesture when he travelled to Liwonde National Park visiting the memorial site of Matthew Talbot.\n\nThe duke was pictured alongside park rangers as they stood firm while he laid down a wreath at the memorial site of Guardsman Matthew Talbot who was just 22 years old when he lost his life earlier this year while on a joint anti-poaching mission with the British Army, the Malawian government and African Parks.\n\nThe Counter-Poaching Operation requires local organisations to monitor and protect wildlife from poachers. These patrols by African Park Rangers can last between ten hours and eight days though and is incredibly dangerous for the guardsmen brave enough to stand their ground.\n\n\"Guardsman Talbot was proud of his role in countering this threat and had played a huge part in the progress and success so far,\" the Sussex Royal Instagram account explains.\n\n\"The Duke laid the wreath on behalf of the Talbot family, and said he was honoured to be able to do so, as he has worked closely with park rangers in these efforts and celebrates each and every one of them as heroes.\"\n\nSEE THE SPECIAL MOMENT HERE:\n\n(A TRIBUTE: Prince Harry visits the memorial site for Guardsman Matthew Talbot of the Coldstream Guards at the Liwonde National Park.
