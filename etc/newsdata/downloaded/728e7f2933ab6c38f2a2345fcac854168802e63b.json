When officers arrived a few minutes later, Hulsey\u2019s wife told police that he had assaulted them both, but had fled with her sister. As police were scouring the nearby neighborhoods for Hulsey, they received a report of a man at a gas station holding an individual at gunpoint.\n\nOfficers rushed to the scene and upon arrival, they learned the person with the handgun was actually a good samaritan who had confronted Hulsey after seeing victim #2 in the vehicle in distress. RPD says Hulsey fled from the Mini Mart location after the samaritan pointed his handgun, and began heading southeast in a field towards the Sacramento River, and was eventually apprehended.\n\nThe woman who was kidnapped confirmed to police that she had been taken against her will, and also said that Hulsey attempted to sexually assault her while in the car. He\u2019s now behind bars on multiple felony charges, including domestic violence, assault with a deadly weapon, carjacking, kidnapping, sexual battery, and resisting arrest.\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about the armed citizen, other than the fact that they are a concealed carry holder. We also know that Shasta County, where Redding is located, has the highest concealed carry rates in the state. According to the California Department of Justice, there are 45.6 concealed carry licenses for every 1,000 residents, or about 45 times the number of concealed carry licenses in Los Angeles County. Shasta County, with less than 180,000 residents, has issued more than 8,000 concealed carry licenses. Compare that to San Francisco County, with a population just under 900,000 residents and 2 concealed carry licensees. I didn\u2019t leave out a digit, by the way. Two. That\u2019s it.\n\nThe odds of you running into one of the two concealed carry holders in San Francisco when you need them are pretty small. Thankfully for the kidnapping victim in Shasta County, her odds were a bit better. I hope that Sheriff Tom Bosenko will be talking about this case with some of his fellow sheriffs in the coming days, particularly those sheriffs in coastal California that refuse to issue concealed carry licenses or give special treatment to their county\u2019s powerful and politically connected residents.\n\nTags:", "description": "Authorities in Redding, California are praising an armed citizen for ending a kidnapping situation at a gas station without ever firing a shot.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/54e5d5404252a414ea89867ac42c3063143ad8ec5551784e7c29_1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
