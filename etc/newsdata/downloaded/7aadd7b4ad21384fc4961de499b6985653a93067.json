If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself. I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen & I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant. I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u201d\n\nA Google search revealed that the Sun published a story about the Rooneys\u2019 basement flooding on Tuesday. But when you click on the story Wednesday morning you get an error message from the Sun, suggesting it has been taken down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe two other fake-news items Rooney claims to have planted on her Instagram remain on the Internet, however. The Sun story about the alleged Mexico trip still lives online, as does the story about her alleged appearance on the British show \u201cStrictly Come Dancing.\u201d Both stories appeared in the Sun\u2019s print edition earlier this year, the Telegraph reports.\n\nIn the Sun\u2019s item about the Rooney-Vardy spat Wednesday, the paper wrote that it asked Coleen Rooney\u2019s representatives for confirmation before publishing those stories \u201cand on each occasion they declined to comment.\u201d\n\nThere were reports of a rift between Wayne Rooney, then England\u2019s captain and for now playing for D.C. United, and Jamie Vardy ahead of the Three Lions\u2019 Euro 2016 match against Iceland, and things got loud enough that England Manager Roy Hodgson tried to knock down the rumors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI will answer for Wayne. There are no problems between Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy,\u201d Hodgson said at a news conference. \u201cThey are good friends and this is a salacious story that has been spun.\u201d\n\nRebekah Vardy had attracted attention during the tournament for accusing French police of treating English fans like \u201canimals.\u201d\n\nIn early August, Wayne Rooney announced he would be leaving D.C. United at the end of this MLS season to return to England as player-manager of Derby County, a club in the second-division League Championship.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Coleen Rooney mounts social-media sting operation to catch Rebekah Vardy, wife of Leicester City\u2019s Jamie Vardy, in the act.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/P0tHIZYELQSVhgKwyXyuCEBS8KM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5773SFXEOUI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
