The global financial center has been slammed with four months of protests, which periodically degenerated into violence. The destruction of property and infrastructure has taken a toll on the embattled city and its trade-reliant economy, which has already taken a hit from the ongoing U.S.-China tariff fight.\n\nIn a statement to esports blog Inven Global, Chung said that the incident \"was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention.\"\n\n\"I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it's my duty to say something about the issue,\" Chung said in a statement to Inven Global.", "description": "Chung \"Blitzchung\" Ng Wai wore a gas mask and goggles and appeared to shout a slogan often associated with Hong Kong protesters: \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time.\"", "authors": ["Eustance Huang"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106171395-1570591861985gettyimages-1166460403.jpeg?v=1570591938", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
