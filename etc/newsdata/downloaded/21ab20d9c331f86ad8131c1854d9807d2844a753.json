But the more we care, the more we worry over their fates, marriages, health and happiness. Now we get to fret over at least three more protagonists, in addition to several of their relations.\n\nNBC renewed \u201cThis Is Us\u201d for two additional seasons, and the show is expected to wrap at Season 6. Creator Dan Fogelman has said we\u2019re now at a midway point where the characters are \u201copening up\u201d to new ventures, telling Entertainment Weekly that it\u2019s \u201ca very exciting period for almost all of the characters, and for some of them, maybe a very scary period in terms of how fraught their story lines are.\u201d Scary? Fraught? Oh, goody.\n\n[The \u2018This Is Us\u2019 finale provided some needed closure. But now we have several more questions.]\n\nBut Fogelman insists he knows where it\u2019s all going. \u201cI have script pages I have written and I\u2019m writing that really are deep, deep, deep into the future,\u201d he told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cLike, we have a plan for what we\u2019re going to do and I know what the plan is.\u201d\n\nThat plan includes some new complicated and lovable people. Let\u2019s break down what we learned in this episode, how these additions fit into the Pearson story and the new questions we have:\n\nBig Three check-in, please\n\nJust as the previous season premieres, this one also falls on the Big Three\u2019s birthday, but we see very little of them in this episode. Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson) are unpacking in their new Philadelphia home. Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Toby (Chris Sullivan) have moved into a house, probably in Los Angeles, where Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and Miguel (Jon Huertas) are also helping. Kevin (Justin Hartley) is also in Los Angeles, having moved back west post-break.\n\nInstead, most the episode focuses on the new people and, according to Fogelman, feels in \u201csome ways almost like a version of Season 1 in the middle of our series,\u201d in which we didn\u2019t learn how all of the characters were connected until the very end.\n\n\n\nA scene from the \u201cThis Is Us\u201d season premiere. (Ron Batzdorff/NBC)\n\nMiguel\n\nWe are in dire need of more Miguel backstory (specifically, how did he and Rebecca go from friends to spouses?). But now we know when he first met Jack: by helping him woo Rebecca. Jack goes to a men\u2019s clothing store to get a suit jacket for his first meeting with Rebecca\u2019s parents, and Miguel is the salesman. Jack can\u2019t afford the jacket, so Miguel, moved by this love story, tells him to just take it and return it in a week. Of course you did, Miguel.\n\n[How \u2018This Is Us\u2019 helped me process my dad\u2019s death]\n\nMalik\n\nOh, look, here comes another wonderful teen whom I want to protect from the darkness of the world. Malik (Asante Blackk) so far seems great: He\u2019s a rising junior in high school, has a summer job and he\u2019s the single father to a baby girl he adores who, like baby Jack, had to be in the newborn intensive-care unit. Malik lives with his parents, Kelly (Marsha Stephanie Blake) and Darnell (Omar Epps), who are exhibiting Jack-Rebecca/Randall-Beth levels of affection. Oh, and Malik loves to cook! Then just when you couldn\u2019t be rooting for him any more, he makes Deja smile like we\u2019ve never seen.\n\nAt a cookout before the first day of school in Philadelphia, Deja tells Malik she\u2019s heard he makes a great burger. He then busts out the same line his dad used on his mom the day before (you know, the one Malik mocked as corny): \u201cFor you, I\u2019ll give it everything I got.\u201d Well done, Malik. Way to take notes from your loving dad.\n\nAnd so it all starts to make a little sense... #ThisIsUs pic.twitter.com/Q1aLy90Ivv \u2014 This Is Us (@NBCThisisUs) September 25, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s clear how Malik would easily become a part of the central story, but we still have many questions: Where is his baby\u2019s mother, and what\u2019s that backstory? Will Malik stay on the straight and narrow or get mixed up with the criminal elements around him? Will Malik realize that a $10,000 preschool is unnecessary for his baby? (I believe you when you say she\u2019s amazing, but save that money for her college fund, son.) And how will Randall and Beth receive him when Deja brings him home for the first time? Hopefully more warmly than Rebecca\u2019s parents welcomed Jack.\n\nCassidy\n\nWe meet Cassidy (Jennifer Morrison) as a soldier stationed in the Middle East running high-wire negotiations that have devastating consequences. Those wartime experiences have understandably taken a toll on her and, by extension, her family once she returns to Pennsylvania. Cassidy has trouble finding work, drinks a lot and is closed off from her husband. Then, to her own horror, she hits her young son.\n\nCassidy ends up separated from her husband and seeks help. The Pearsons enter the scene during what appears to be either a group counseling or Alcoholics Anonymous meeting at a Veterans Affairs center: As Cassidy tells a heart-wrenching story, Nicky Pearson throws a chair through the window and gets arrested.\n\nQuestions: How, exactly, will Cassidy get roped into the Pearson world going forward? Kevin is called to post bail; will he and Cassidy connect?\n\nJack Damon\n\nWe don\u2019t know this guy\u2019s name until the end of the episode, but over the course of the hour, we find out a lot: He is little Jack, offspring of Kate and Toby, and he grows up to have a great life.\n\nHe has Toby\u2019s sense of humor and, per Toby\u2019s wishes, not his hairline. He is blind (the actor who plays him, Blake Stadnik, has Stargardt disease and is visually impaired). He has a dismal music career, yet, like his parents before him, somehow maintains a nice apartment.\n\nAnd then everything changes for him, thanks to a shattered plate. After spending a night wallowing in self-pity and alcohol when he fails to write a good song (writing is really, really hard and painful!), he wakes up hung over. So he makes breakfast, which his puppy promptly knocks out of his hand, shattering the plate. He then goes to a diner and meets a waitress, where it\u2019s instant sparks. Inspired, he writes a song about strangers; they date, get married, then get pregnant. He goes on to play the stranger-song in arenas.\n\nSo of course the shattered plate is now framed. Must everyone on this show have an unbelievable meet-cute that forever alters the course of their entire lives? Apparently no one in the \u201cThis Is Us\u201d television universe uses dating apps.\n\nRead more:\n\nMen are crying on TV as never before\n\n\u2018This Is Us\u2019 finally reveals how Jack Pearson died", "description": "The NBC drama is now at its midway point, so let\u2019s break down how these new additions fit into the Pearson story.", "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer", "September At Pm", "Elahe Izadi Is A Pop Culture Writer For The Washington Post.
