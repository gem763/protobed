If it's the Sarries way or the England way, we need to match that. There a few things that we saw that Saracens do that we can manage. We are ready for that; different jerseys but similar game plans.\n\nEngland star Maro Itoje is in line to face his club team-mate Koch in the Rugby World Cup final\n\n'Mako, playing with him - I've scrummed quite a lot against him in training. Same with Joe Marler in the Premiership. I know exactly what they do, I've felt what they've done in the past. It's going to be exciting to go up against them again. This is different, it's not a training field, it's quite a big test.'\n\nSouth Africa's pack is loaded with experience - and they have been naming six forwards on the bench to boost their physical siege in the second half.\n\nThey are led by inspirational flanker and skipper Siya Kolisi, who hailed from a township and has become a symbol of hope for the troubled nation.\n\nCaptain Siya Kolisi (right) is a hero in South Africa following his rise from living in a township\n\nAssistant coach Matt Proudfoot said: 'I think South Africa as a country has got a lot of challenges. But it's a country with a hell of a lot of pride in their national team.\n\n'When you see a player become a Springbok, they change. They take what it means to them to the country. There is a real connection between the Springbok player and what it means to be a Springbok and the supporter back home.\n\n'Everyone involved in this, we understand it is a final. I suppose the side that does what they do better will be the more successful team.'", "description": "NIK SIMON IN TOKYO: South Africa prop Vincent Koch is hoping his inside track on England's Saracens contingent will come to the fore in Saturday's World Cup final.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/06/20362682-0-image-a-4_1572417303435.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
