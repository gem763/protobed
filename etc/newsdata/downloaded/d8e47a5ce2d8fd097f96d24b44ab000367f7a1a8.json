There were times where it was pretty good and there were times where it was challenging.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a court that I think is tough to neutralize and play defense over a long period. It\u2019s definitely a court that you get your bang for buck and you get value when you try to take the initiative.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s Osaka, seeded fourth, needed only 59 minutes to brush aside German qualifier Andrea Petkovic with a dominant 6-2 6-0 win.\n\nOsaka converted five break points and fired 21 winners in a one-sided contest to set up a clash with American Alison Riske, who beat Australian Ajla Tomljanovic 6-3 3-6 6-4 in the only three-set match of the day.\n\nAngelique Kerber\u2019s poor form dragged on after another early exit at the hands of Slovenia\u2019s Polona Hercog who won 6-4 6-2.\n\nApart from a semi-final run in Osaka, 10th seed Kerber has not moved past the second round of tournaments in Zhengzhou, Wuhan and now Beijing.\n\nChina\u2019s Zheng Saisai converted five of six break points to beat former U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens 6-3 6-1 in 76 minutes to set up a last-16 clash with Barty.\n\nCzech Republic\u2019s Petra Kvitova beat France\u2019s Kristina Mladenovic 6-4 6-4 but 12th seed Aryna Sabalenka, who won the Wuhan Open title over the weekend was knocked out by Russia\u2019s unseeded Daria Kasatkina 6-4 7-6(5).", "description": "Top seeds Ash Barty and Naomi Osaka cruised into the last 16 of the China Open with straight sets victories in their second round matches in Beijing on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
