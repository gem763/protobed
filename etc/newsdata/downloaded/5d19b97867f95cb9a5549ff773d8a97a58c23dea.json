Unlike other state\u2019s bans that came before it, Alabama\u2019s law did not provide exceptions for survivors of rape or incest, and would\u2019ve only permitted abortion in cases where a continued pregnancy posed a \u201cserious health risk\u201d to the mother.\n\n\n\nThe law was part of a wave of efforts designed to trigger a legal challenge that anti-abortion advocates hoped could rise to the Supreme Court to challenge Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1973 ruling to legalize abortion nationwide.\n\nNone of the restrictive abortion bans passed by several states this year are currently in effect, thanks to court challenges. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey even acknowledged the law likely wouldn\u2019t be enforceable in her state after she signed it. Alabama\u2019s ban will remain blocked until the \u201ccourt resolves the case in full,\u201d according to the preliminary injunction issued Tuesday by Judge Myron Thompson of the United States District Court in Middle Alabama.\n\nEarlier this month, a federal judge also blocked Georgia\u2019s abortion ban from taking effect in January 2020, since it would\u2019ve outlawed the procedure as early as six weeks into a person\u2019s pregnancy. That law, too, was an attempt at getting abortion before the high court, which now skews conservative thanks to the addition of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in October 2018. The court already agreed this year to hear an abortion case from Louisiana that challenges a law that requires abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.\n\n\"While we are relieved to learn that abortion will remain legal in Alabama for the foreseeable future, this changes nothing when it comes to the crisis marginalized communities have faced and will continue to face when it comes to accessing a termination,\u201d Amanda Reyes, executive director at the Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund said in a statement. \u201cConservative lawmakers hope that the American public will forget about our state and those who remain unable to easily, quickly and affordably access safe abortion care even with the total abortion ban being put on hold.\u201d\n\nCover: Protesters for women's rights march to the Alabama Capitol to protest a bill to ban abortion that passed last week , Sunday, May 19, 2019, in Montgomery, Ala.
