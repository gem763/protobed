There\u2019s this persistent cultural idea that getting a full night\u2019s sleep makes you lazy or indulgent, when in fact it makes you healthy and productive.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about why you\u2019re so tired.\n\nReasons you\u2019re so tired\n\nYou aren\u2019t getting enough sleep: Duh \u2014 you probably already know this. But it\u2019s easy to overlook and important to remember. \u201cOur society is sleep-deprived,\u201d says Dr. Brian Murray, a neurologist who works in the Sleep Disorder Clinic at Toronto\u2019s Sunnybrook Research Institute. \u201cMost people need seven to nine hours of sleep, and get less.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t get enough exercise, and you\u2019re not eating healthy enough: Again, these are the boring answers that you could have seen coming, but they\u2019re true. Study after study has found that progressively increasing physical activity leads to a progressive increase in deep sleep. Similarly, studies have found that diets high in fruits, vegetables, low-fat protein and dairy tend to lead to better sleep. And you also probably knew this, but eating close to bedtime is also associated with bad sleep.\n\nTL;DR: Sorry to disappoint by giving the oldest and most obvious health advice there is, but if you exercise more and eat better, you\u2019ll live a healthier life.\n\nMedications: Drowsiness is a common side effect of many medications \u2014 notably many kinds of tricyclic antidepressants, blood pressure medications and allergy meds.\n\nIt\u2019s the middle of the night or it\u2019s mid-afternoon: People have a natural dip in energy between two and four in the morning, and again around two in the afternoon. It\u2019s best not to engage in \u201cdemanding attentional situations\u201d during those times, Murray tells HuffPost Canada.\n\nThat people would be tired between 2 and 4 a.m. is fairly intuitive, but many people don\u2019t know about the afternoon lull, Murray adds. Many people blame an afternoon drop in energy on the post-lunch effect, but \u201cit\u2019s not just food that\u2019s doing that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a circadian effect. Every cell in your body has a little molecular clock, and it goes through these little rhythms.\u201d\n\nSleep disorders: It\u2019s possible the sleep you get at night isn\u2019t restful because you have a disorder like sleep apnea. If your tiredness gets to a point where you\u2019re falling asleep at inappropriate times \u2014 while you\u2019re in the middle of a conversation, or while you\u2019re driving \u2014 you could be suffering from narcolepsy. And if you\u2019re tired during the day because you can\u2019t get any sleep at night, you could have insomnia. These are all conditions to bring up with your doctor.\n\nMedical conditions: Don\u2019t worry, people who Google \u201cIs being very tired a sign of cancer?\u201d It\u2019s very unlikely that your fatigue is caused by cancer, but it could potentially be linked to some diseases. Feeling tired all day is sometimes a symptom of depression. Thyroid disease also causes people to feel tired.\n\nAnd because neurodegenerative conditions can cause certain parts of the brain to degenerate, a degeneration in the area that controls sleep and wake could cause sleepiness in someone suffering from a disorder like Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhat happens when you don\u2019t sleep enough\n\nAgain, you probably already know this, but lack of sleep will negatively impact your body AND your mind. Wild, huh?\n\nBad mood: Much like toddlers, when adults don\u2019t get enough sleep, we\u2019re likely to become cranky, irritable or unhappy.\n\nInattention: Ever zone out during a meeting when you were exhausted? It can be harder to concentrate on specific tasks when you haven\u2019t had enough sleep. This can sometimes be dangerous: a lack of focus can lead to traffic accidents, Murray says.\n\nDisease risk: Murray says people who are sleep-deprived tend to have an increased body weight and are at a higher risk of diabetes and cardiovascular illness. \u201cI think people underestimate the impact of loss of sleep on their general health,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe spend a third of our lives in this state, so our bodies have adapted to do this for a very good reason.\u201d\n\nHow to stop feeling tired\n\nSleep more: Come on, you knew this was coming.\n\nMake sure your sleeping area is comfortable: You want a place that\u2019s cool, quiet, dark and comfortable \u2014 and preferably, somewhere with minimal electronics. The National Sleep Foundation explains that computers, phones, and other devices suppress your body\u2019s release of melatonin, a hormone that stimulates sleep. So not only does it make you more alert, it also delays your REM sleep.\n\nExercise more: Sorry, but yup.\n\nBalance your diet: See above.\n\nTalk to you doctor about current medications: If you\u2019re on meds that make you drowsy, bring it up with your doctor. They might offer you a non-drowsy version, change your dosage, or consider switching to something else.\n\nDrink coffee: This is helpful \u2014 up to a point. \u201cA couple cups of coffee a day can help improve mild impairments in alertness, but it can only go so far,\u201d Murray says. \u201cCaffeine isn\u2019t liquid sleep, and you can\u2019t replace sleep loss entirely.\u201d\n\nStand up more often: Turns out all those standing-desk people were onto something. \u201cStanding is one of the biggest ways to return to alertness,\u201d Murray says. \u201cThe postural change has a big impact.\u201d", "description": "Experts explain why you might feel like you have no energy.", "authors": ["Maija Kappler", "Huffpost Canada"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d76581c240000d32677c850.jpeg?cache=dXeXql2GTS&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
