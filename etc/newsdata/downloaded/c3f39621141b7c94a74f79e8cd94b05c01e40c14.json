But what has been done by politicians around the world to heed this repeatedly given advice?\n\nThe answer, sadly, is too little too late. Politicians across the globe have not understood the urgency that the climate chaos requires from us. They have not understood the key message that reports like the IPCC\u2019s report last year were trying to convey to us: we are reaching a tipping point for the future of our planet.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

We need to be bold in our approach to climate chaos. We need to be radical and decisive in taking the necessary steps.\n\nThe small incremental steps taken by our governments in the last 20 years are not enough and don\u2019t deserve the rhetorical pats on the shoulder so well described by Leadsom in her letter.\n\nAs highlighted by the Committee on Climate Change last week, the UK is set to miss the goal to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, undermining Leadsom\u2019s claim of British leadership in tackling climate change. It\u2019s not enough that \u201cwe will continue to break renewables records in the years to come\u201d, as the business secretary wrote in her letter. If the Tories want to show genuine leadership, then they could implement measures such as a Green New Deal, commit to net-zero emissions by 2030, and stop airport expansion. These are just some of the measures that would prove to the world that Britain is not just paying lip service to tackle climate change but it is taking the necessary decisions to tackle the chaos.\n\nWe should not be content with the current environmental policies, but be more radical, more decisive in taking the steps that for so long we have been afraid to take.\n\nPoliticians never tire of praising the industrial revolution and the way in which it transformed this country. But we can now see the deleterious impact of our economic system on the planet, so we should be putting the same energy, efforts and economic resources towards helping to mitigate against its effects, rather than focusing solely on its triumphs.\n\nHow can we achieve that? By creating a new Green revolution. One that puts environmental and social justice at its core. Take the suffragette movement and anti-apartheid campaigners, for example, both deemed to be \"illegal\" protesters at one stage, before their hand in fighting for justice ultimately changed our society changed for the better. When it comes to the planet, those at the forefront of climate justice should be considered just as integral to creating much-needed change. The survival of the world depends on it.\n\nAmelia Womack is deputy leader of the Green Party", "description": "Reading Andrea Leadsom\u2019s letter in the Evening Standard (Andrea Leadsom: You\u2019re protesting in the wrong c", "authors": ["Amelia Womack"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/12/Extinction-Rebellion-London-march-24.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
