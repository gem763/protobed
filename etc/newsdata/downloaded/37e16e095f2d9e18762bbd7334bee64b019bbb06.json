Not only did she cover the world\u2019s most influential magazine , she was treated to a \u201crapturous\u201d two-minute standing ovation at Judy\u2019s Toronto premiere. Her comeback turn as Judy Garland, the self-proclaimed \u201cqueen of comebacks,\u201d is an irresistible amalgam of performance and narrative, and while the reception to Rupert Goold\u2019s movie has been somewhat mild, voters have a history of overlooking such things in biopics, especially ones that give their leads as many juicy Oscar-y scenes as Judy does. It\u2019s still early, but as the film makes its way into limited release, Zellweger looks like the one to beat.\n\nDown\n\nMeryl Streep, The Laundromat\n\nSaying The Laundromat \u201cis unlikely to be among Netflix\u2019s top priorities this awards season\u201d is like saying I am unlikely to be the Democrats\u2019 presidential nominee: I think they might have better options. Alongside The Goldfinch, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s madcap Panama Papers expos\u00e9 was one of the disappointments of festival season, a disjointed procedural that plays like a defrauded man\u2019s Big Short. Most of the chatter around The Laundromat has centered on Meryl Streep, who turns in a typically winning performance in one half of the movie, and, uh, dresses in brownface in the other. We needn\u2019t weep too many tears over her early exit from this race: Streep still has a supporting turn in Little Women coming down the pike, and her absence helps make this one of the most wide-open Actress categories in years. Don\u2019t be surprised if an early-season dark horse like Awkwafina or Lupita Nyong\u2019o winds up storming into the final five.", "description": "Every week between now and January 13, when the Academy Award nominations are announced, Vulture will consult its crystal ball to determine the changing fortunes in this year\u2019s Oscars race.
