Lindsey Graham, who called the commitment flimsy and said it left America\u2019s Kurdish allies in the lurch. The House passed a overwhelmingly bipartisan rebuke of the decision Wednesday, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he wanted a \u201cstronger\u201d version to come out of his chamber.\n\nSEE ALSO: Mick Mulvaney denies Ukraine \u2018quid pro quo,\u2019 says no plans to resign\n\nHowever Mr. Graham, one of the president\u2019s top critics on the issue, had a different attitude Sunday.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News, the South Carolina Republican said he was still concerned about America\u2019s commitment to the endangered Kurds, but was optimistic about Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to move troops to secure the oil fields.\n\nHe described it as an opportunity for a \u201chistoric\u201d way forward for all parties involved by having Syrian democratic forces join with a \u201csmall force\u201d of Americans to keep the oil resources out of the hands of Syria\u2019s regime and its Iranian allies.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line here is, you have got to play the ball where it lies. And if President Trump fulfills the objectives he laid out to me, then I think we can end Syria successfully,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who did vote to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s Syria decision, said on Fox News he didn\u2019t think Congress should take any more action, including moving forward on sanctions against Turkey, until the administration had a chance to brief them on their progress abroad.\n\nWith Syria straining relations earlier this week, Republicans were put in a tough spot as reports coming out about the closed-door impeachment inquiry sessions have not bode well for the president.\n\nOver the past three weeks, several State Department officials have testified as part of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry centered on accusations that Mr. Trump pressured Ukrainian leaders to open investigations for his personal political gain.\n\nReports on those confidential meetings showed that several officials were concerned about the role that Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 who was pursuing an investigation into the Biden family \u2014 played in Ukrainian foreign policy. They were also concerned about the abrupt ouster of then-Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who reportedly pushed back on the administration\u2019s efforts to have Ukraine open investigations.\n\nShe was later disparaged by both Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani, as well as became a target in a conspiracy theory packet delivered to Mr. Pompeo.\n\nThe secretary said he did pass along that packet, but never reviewed the contents.\n\nActing Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney only made matters worse for the president when he publicly linked the nearly $400 million in delayed military aid for Ukraine as tied in part to the administration\u2019s desire for an investigation into the 2016 election and whether DNC servers were located in the Eastern European country.\n\nHe later walked back his remarks and said the news media misconstrued them to further their \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nDuring his interview, Mr. Pompeo wouldn\u2019t comment on Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s remarks, but said he never saw anything concerning about Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe conversation was always around what were the strategic implications,\u201d he said about the delayed aid.\n\nHe did, however, defend Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role in the Ukraine situation.\n\n\u201cPrivate citizens are often part of executing American foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is completely appropriate.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the former New York City mayor defied a Congressional subpoena to turn over documents related to the Ukraine investigation.\n\nMr. Giuliani has become one of the central figures in the impeachment inquiry, as he worked to push Ukraine to open an investigation corruption involving Vice President Joseph R. Biden, one of the 2020 Democratic presidential frontrunners, and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nNow, both Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut and Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas \u2014 who sit on the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 say Mr. Giuliani should come in and speak directly to his role in the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile I guess we could sort of piece together exactly what happened based on what the administration has disclosed, I really think it\u2019s important to talk to Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Mr. Himes said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Mulvaney continued to walk back the comments he made at Thursday\u2019s press conference, after Fox News host Chris Wallace pointed out two examples of him linking aid to an investigation into 2016 election interference in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI never said there was a \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 cause there isn\u2019t,\u201d he said, arguing proof of that was in the fact that the aid was eventually delivered.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Republicans have continued to push back on the inquiry as an illegitimate, secretive and unfair process.\n\nThey\u2019re set to force a vote to try to censure House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff \u2014 which is unlikely to succeed \u2014 and have sent letters to chairmen spearheading the impeachment investigation demanding their rights to the committee materials be honored, citing the precedents of the impeachment cases against Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cYou want to trust democracy. And from a very important standpoint here, we need due process in this. A Republican speaker made sure this process happened with President Clinton. A Democrat speaker made sure this process happened with a Republican president,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said Sunday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
