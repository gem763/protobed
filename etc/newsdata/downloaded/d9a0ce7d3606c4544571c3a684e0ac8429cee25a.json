(Gary A. Vasquez/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLeBron James is justly enduring a public-relations disaster because of his comments on the roiling controversies about the NBA\u2019s relationship with China. He called the Daryl Morey tweet that offended Chinese authorities \u201cmisinformed\u201d and made the normally anodyne point that free speech can have adverse consequences for the speaker.\n\nBut China isn\u2019t interested in free speech, and the consequences for the NBA are the intended result of government coercion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames is politically outspoken against the American president, and on behalf of most social-justice causes. He has accepted comparisons to Muhammad Ali, and claimed to want the burden of making things better for minorities in the next generation.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why his comments about Daryl Morey being \u201cmisinformed\u201d strike us as so unusually ill-founded. The same applies to coach Steve Kerr, who drew out an implicit moral equivalence by restating his own criticisms of American life and government.\n\nThere is nothing \u201cmisinformed\u201d about supporting the Hong Kong protestors, and deploring the Chinese Communist Party. China is still a country of forced abortions. It\u2019s a country of open, systematic, state-led ethnic and religious persecution. It\u2019s a country of social censorship. It\u2019s a country of Kafkaesque social policy: millions of Chinese people who were born illegally as second or third children have no right to education or work, and some do not even have their births registered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think Americans actually would show some understanding and patience with NBA players and personalities that remained discreetly silent. The league\u2019s lucrative involvement in China dates to a time when hopes for China\u2019s liberalization seemed more realistic. And the league\u2019s players may be correct in calculating that any protests against Chinese human-rights abuses from them would not have any salutary effect on China, and could possibly have an adverse one, making Hong Kongers look like subjects of American intrigue rather than genuine interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut LeBron\u2019s political self-regard, his financial interests, and his silence simply paint a damning picture.", "description": "LeBron\u2019s political self-regard, his financial interests, and his silence simply paint a damning picture.", "authors": ["Michael Brendan Dougherty", "Kevin D.
