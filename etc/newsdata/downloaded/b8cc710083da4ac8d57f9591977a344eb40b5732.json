This experience gave him confidence of sufficient expertise and capability to assess the investment merits to minimise the risk of poor performance.\n\nWith plans to work for at least another six years, the timeframe may be sufficient to support a high-growth strategy.\n\nDiversification risk\n\nDiversification might have different interpretations for different people. But as a general investment rule, it implies holding a range of assets to mitigate the risk of one particular asset failing to meet expectations.\n\nAt first glance, Joe\u2019s investment strategy lacks diversification. But it may be less risky when taking into account Joe's full circumstances, including risk profile, preferences and investment experience.\n\nThe SMSF fund is heavily weighted in property but Joe also has a public offer superannuation fund with almost $100,000 that is invested in shares. Overall, his total superannuation portfolio is starting to show a more balanced portfolio, bringing the overall property exposure to only 86 per cent of his total superannuation savings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiquidity risk\n\nThe trustees of an SMSF need to be able to pay expenses of the fund and benefits to members as required. This may present problems for an SMSF that is heavily invested in non-liquid assets such as property.\n\nIn managing liquidity risk, the trustee needs to consider cash outflows against cash inflows. This may include the ability of members to make contributions and expected investment earnings.\n\nWith a geared property investment, it is particularly important that the trustee has a plan not only to meet interest costs, but also to extinguish the debt as liquidity may become more difficult to manage once the fund converts to pension phase.\n\nOptions that Joe took into consideration for ensuring sufficient liquidity included:\n\nTime to retirement \u2013 the fund is fully invested in the accumulation phase which minimises current outflows. A pension can't be started for at least three years, with a plan to extend this to at least six years before retiring. This provides time to formulate a plan for injecting further savings into the fund and to retire the debt.\n\nthe fund is fully invested in the accumulation phase which minimises current outflows.

This provides time to formulate a plan for injecting further savings into the fund and to retire the debt. Ability to make contributions \u2013 every year Joe maximises his concessional contribution cap through a combination of employer superannuation guarantee contributions and personal deductible contributions. In addition, Joe has a personal savings plan to ensure additional non-concessional contributions can be made to repay the debt before retiring and converting the fund to pension phase.\n\nevery year Joe maximises his concessional contribution cap through a combination of employer superannuation guarantee contributions and personal deductible contributions. In addition, Joe has a personal savings plan to ensure additional non-concessional contributions can be made to repay the debt before retiring and converting the fund to pension phase. Investment returns \u2013 a cash flow analysis for the fund shows that the expected net rental return is marginally less than the loan repayments. But with the additional contributions, cash flow (after other expenses and taxation) is expected to be positive on an annual basis, allowing the trustee to comfortably meet liquidity requirements. The ability to inject additional funds or rollover from the public offer fund add potential liquidity.\n\nPulling it together\n\nAll SMSFs are required to have a documented investment strategy, but often these are prepared to meet compliance obligations and not actively used by trustees to help manage their fund effectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA fund which is primarily invested in a property can be a high-risk strategy. But as shown in this case study, if the trustee has an investment strategy that includes a cash flow plan and a risk assessment analysis, the overall risks can be reduced to ensure it is an appropriate investment strategy.\n\nThe issues that Joe considered won\u2019t necessarily apply to other funds, as each trustee needs to consider their individual fund\u2019s circumstances, but prepared properly, an investment strategy can be a useful risk management tool.\n\nAs well as documenting how the fund can invest, it may be useful to review the current strategy to ensure it includes details on how diversification and liquidity will be managed. Auditors are likely to take a more active role in reviewing that the fund has an appropriate investment strategy.\n\nGeneral advice only.
