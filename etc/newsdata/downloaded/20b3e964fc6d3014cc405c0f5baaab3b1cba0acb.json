That figure held mostly steady until the Great Recession. Then it started to drop off and took a dive after 2010, said report co-author Una Osili, associate dean for research and international programs at the Lilly School.\n\nThe decline amounts to 20 million fewer households donating to charity in 2000 versus 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, researchers said.\n\nSee also: Why Melinda Gates\u2019s $1 billion pledge for women and girls is a game-changer\n\nThe analysis drew on data from the Philanthropy Panel Study, a data set within the University of Michigan\u2019s Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which tracks the same 9,000 families\u2019 charitable giving every two years.\n\nAmericans are losing their religion\n\nOne factor driving the decline: Americans are becoming less likely to attend religious services or identify with a specific religion.\n\n\u201cAttending services is correlated with giving to religious organizations, but it\u2019s also correlated with giving to secular groups,\u201d Osili said.\n\nGiving to charity is, of course, a core belief for many of the world\u2019s major religions. And very religious people of any faith are more likely to give to charity, one study by Baylor University researchers found.\n\nBut there are fewer very religious people than ever in the U.S. The share of the population who describe themselves as atheists, agnostics or \u201cnothing in particular\u201d is now at 26%, up from 17% in 2009, according to 2018 and 2019 surveys by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan \u201cfact tank\u201d in Washington, D.C.\n\nSome 65% of Americans describe themselves as Christians, down 12 percentage points since 2009, Pew found.\n\nReligious organizations have traditionally gotten the lion\u2019s share of Americans\u2019 charitable dollars. But that\u2019s fallen slightly recently. While religious groups still received the largest chunk of charitable dollars in 2018, at 29% of total giving, it was the first year that giving to religion fell below 30% of overall giving, according to the Giving USA annual report on philanthropy, now in its 64th year.\n\nSee also: The U.S. is the No. 1 most generous country in the world for the last decade\n\n(Giving USA is produced by The Giving Institute, an association of fundraising consultants and firms that service nonprofits, in collaboration with the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.)\n\nSome Catholics have said they\u2019re giving less money to the church because of reports of sexual abuse by clergy. Nearly half of Catholics \u2014 47% \u2014 said they were donating less to their individual parishes in response to reports of sexual abuse, a poll conducted by the Catholic magazine America found, according to the Giving USA report.\n\nAmerica\u2019s uneven recovery from the Great Recession is also a factor\n\nHouseholds led by people with less than a high school education, less than $50,000 in income and/or less than $50,000 in wealth (a household\u2019s total assets) decreased the share of income they donated to charity significantly after the recession, the Lilly School report found.\n\nThat\u2019s do in part to the fact that not all Americans have recovered equally from the economic downturn, the report authors said.\n\n\u201cThis shift is due to lower-income and lower-wealth Americans experiencing the slowest economic recovery since the Great Recession, during years when the cost of other items such as food, education and healthcare have increased,\u201d said Jane Greenfield, president of Vanguard Charitable. \u201cThis has led to a decrease in the share of income available to give to charity.\u201d\n\nYounger people are giving less\n\nMillennials in particular give less of their income to charity than their older counterparts, the analysis found, probably because they \u201chad the misfortune of entering the workforce during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression,\u201d the authors noted.\n\nWhen the baby boomers and Generation X entered the workforce, the percent of income they gave to charity increased. But millennials haven\u2019t yet followed suit. \u201cThere\u2019s a general trajectory that as you get older your income grows and your giving grows,\u201d Osili said. \u201cWith millennials we haven\u2019t seen that same pattern.\u201d", "description": "Some 20 million fewer households donating to charity than they did two decades ago.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU052_man_ch_ZG_20191025160657.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
