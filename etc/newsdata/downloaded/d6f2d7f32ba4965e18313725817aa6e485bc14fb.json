The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the deaths in January 2018\n\nStaff Sgt Bryan Black, 35 (left) and Staff Sgt Jeremiah Johnson, 39 (right) were the other two soldiers killed. Four Nigerien troops were also killed in the ambush\n\nSo far, no arrests have been made in connection with the ambush.\n\n'We hope to generate leads or information that would lead the US government or the Nigerien government to investigate and find the perpetrators of that attack,' an anonymous official told Agence France-Presse.\n\nA partial report released by the Pentagon in May 2018 found that a series of 'individual and organizational failures' contributed to the soldiers' deaths.\n\n'The investigation identifies individual, organizational and institutional failures and deficiencies that contributed to the tragic events of 4 October 2017,' an eight-page summary of the report says.\n\n'No single failure or deficiency was the sole reason for the events.'\n\nThe report did not assign blame, but said recommendations had been made to US Special Operations Command on actions that could be taken against personnel.\n\nThe top US military official in Africa said that ultimately he was responsible.\n\n'I take ownership for all the events connected to the ambush of 4 October. Again, the responsibility is mine,' Marine General Thomas Waldhauser, the head of US Africa Command, said during a Pentagon press briefing at the time.\n\nEven before the US Special Operations Forces Team arrived in Niger, high personnel turnover had prevented the team from carrying out important pre-deployment training as a team, the report found.\n\nOnly half of the team had trained together when it arrived in Niger in fall 2017.\n\nOn October 3, the special forces team, along with partner Niger forces, set out on a mission to target a key Islamic State militant near the village of Tiloa, Niger.\n\nThe team had not trained for the mission and did not notify higher-level commanders that it would be undertaking it.\n\nA partial report released by the Pentagon in May 2018 found that a series of 'individual and organizational failures' contributed to the soldiers' deaths.

President Donald Trump told Johnson's wife that he knew what he signed up for during a condolence call\n\nWhile the team mischaracterized this mission, the report did not find a direct link between that and the ambush that killed the four US soldiers.\n\nThe top US general said last year that the team was on a reconnaissance mission.\n\nOn the way back to its base, after carrying out a separate intelligence gathering mission, the team stopped at the village of Tongo Tongo to resupply. It was then that the U.S. soldiers, along with their Nigerien partners, were ambushed by militants.\n\nThe report and a 10-minute video shown to reporters details the gun battle and how at one point U.S. Army Sergeant La David Johnson sought to run away on foot from the militants after he was unable to enter his vehicle.\n\nHe was ultimately killed about 3,300 feet from the vehicle, hit as many as 18 times, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHis death generated a storm of controversy when President Donald Trump told Johnson's wife that he knew what he signed up for during a condolence call\n\nTwo of the soldiers' bodies were found in the back of a militant's vehicle and one body next to it, said Army Major General Roger Cloutier, who led the investigation into the ambush.\n\nAs a result of the October incident, US forces in Africa would now be more 'prudent' in carrying out missions and improvements have been made for troops in areas such as firepower and equipment, response times and level of intelligence provided, Waldhauser said.", "description": "The US State Department has issued two $5million bounties for any identification or location of the ISIS militants that killed four US soliders in an ambush in Niger in October 2017.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19315648-0-image-a-40_1570223363955.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
