In post-settlement trade, it was down $12.65, or 0.8%, at $1,492.65 by 2:47 PM ET (18:47 GMT).\n\n, which tracks live trades in bullion, was down $14.10, or 0.9%, at $1,490.41.\n\n\u201cWith comments from China suggesting firm progress on the trade deal and overall optimistic risk-on mentality in the markets, it makes sense to see safe haven liquidation,\u201d said Eric Scoles, commodity markets strategist for RJO Futures in Chicago.\n\n\u201cAs long as economic mentality remains this positive, it would take some significant event to see gold turn into a bull market anytime soon. I wouldn\u2019t consider the trend to be truly bearish just yet either.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s slide in gold belied weaker data out of Beijing that reinforced signs that the Chinese economy was slowing.\n\nProfits at Chinese industrial companies fell for the second-straight month in September as producer prices continued their slide, data showed, highlighting the impact of a slowing economy and protracted U.S. trade war on corporate balance sheets.\n\nand bullion had steadily advanced over the past week to recapture the $1,500 handle that had been out of reach in the two prior weeks. The catalyst for the rebound had been Wednesday\u2019s upcoming Fed rate decision, where the U.S. central bank is expected to approve a third-straight quarter-point rate cut for the year.\n\nWhile another round of U.S. easing is expected, gold could take an even bigger hit if the Fed decides to leave rates unchanged this week.\n\nHow bad that hit will be is still anyone\u2019s guess. COMEX futures fell to $1,465 on Sept. 29, while tumbled to $1,459.15 on Oct. 1. The yellow metal could test those lows and more, unless, of course, Brexit complications spike again or the much-touted \"phase one\" of the U.S.-China trade deal doesn\u2019t get done.", "description": "Gold Loses $1,500 Perch as Trump Talks up Prospect of Quicker China Deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED1M0ED_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
