Joseph Dunford helped him make 2015 decision to run", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump welcomed Mark A. Milley, the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, on Monday by thanking the departing one with helping him make the decision to run for president in 2015.\n\nMr. Trump said he struck up a conversation with Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. at an awards dinner that year, before he announced his candidacy. The general looked like he was out of \u201ccentral casting\u201d and noticed Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in the military.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well, I just love our country,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump recounted during a welcome ceremony for Gen. Milley, the 20th chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the first people I asked. I said, \u2018What do you think, do you think I\u2019d have a shot?\u201d Mr. Trump recalled. \u201cThis was before it was public.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, who hadn\u2019t shared this story before, said the general helped him \u201cform an opinion\u201d and \u201cgave me a lot of information\u201d that fueled his push to bolster the military after winning the presidency.\n\n\u201cWe had to have a modern, great military with the most magnificent and the finest machinery, planes, boats, ships, weapons of all kinds,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had anything like you have today. When I took over, we were a very depleted military, and today we\u2019re at a level that we have never even come close to.\u201d\n\nGen. Dunford swore in Gen. Milley, a 61-year-old from Massachusetts with an Ivy League education, from a rainy Summerall Field at the Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Virginia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that if it rains on a big occasion, it brings luck. So, Mark, I think you\u2019re going to be the luckiest general in history,\u201d Mr. Trump told Gen. Milley.\n\nGen. Milley is a four-star general in the U.S. Army who deployed to combat sites across the world during his distinguished military career. The general thanked his family for the sacrifices they\u2019ve made along his journey and offered a nod to his Princeton hockey team, which had trouble winning any games.\n\nOn a more serious note, he warned potential enemies that the U.S. military is more prepared than ever.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to keep the peace or, if necessary, win the war,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ceremony featured a 19-gun salute and plenty of pomp and circumstance.\n\nMr. Trump attended the ceremony after tweeting a torrent of attacks on Democrats pursuing impeachment over his interactions with Ukraine. One late Sunday missive quoted Pastor Robert Jeffress as saying Mr. Trump\u2019s removal office would spark a \u201ccivil war.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who\u2019s served in the military, scolded the president.\n\n\u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war,\u201d he tweeted, tagging Mr. Trump. \u201cI have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a president. This is beyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
