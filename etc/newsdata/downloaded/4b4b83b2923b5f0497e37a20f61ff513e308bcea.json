I love his professionalism.\n\n\u201cHe was bang-on when he spoke to me, with what he said when he was away with France. He shouldn\u2019t be happy and accept not playing. That\u2019s what good players do.\n\n\u201cAs I said to Ollie, he will get his games and be a big influence for us. At the moment, because of how Tammy is playing, there hasn\u2019t been the minutes for him.\n\n\u201cI will happily sit down with Ollie in January.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBut January is a long way away. I don\u2019t want him to go, he\u2019s a big part of the squad.\n\n\u201cTammy has been producing but I will sit down with Ollie because I respect him. I want him here.\u201d\n\nGiroud joined Chelsea from Arsenal in January 2018, and said he wouldn't be afraid to move again if he does not get enough game time.\n\nAfter scoring twice for France during last week's international break, Giroud said: \"Chelsea is my priority, but if in the end I'm forced to make a choice, I will do it as when I left Arsenal.\"", "description": "French striker is unhappy at lack of playing time, but Chelsea boss says he has plans for him", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18949899.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-JPN-CHELSEA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
