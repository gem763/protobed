The bill was intended to \u201cprohibit any form of sexual relations between persons of the same sex,\u201d to the point of making even the \u201crecognition\u201d of homosexual relationships a crime.\n\nIn a statement, Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo told Reuters:\n\nHomosexuality is not natural to Ugandans, but there has been a massive recruitment by gay people in schools, and especially among the youth, where they are promoting the falsehood that people are born like that. Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the act. We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do grave acts will be given the death sentence.\n\nSimilar draconian measures are common across the continent, and the world at large. In May, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei was forced to back away from instituting the death penalty for homosexuality in the southeast Asian country. Last year, Russia saw a dramatic escalation in hate crimes toward its LGBT citizens after President Vladimir Putin enacted a ban on \u201cgay propaganda,\u201d which targeted visibly gay characters and personalities in Russian media.\n\nThere are currently 72 countries where being gay is a criminal offense. In many of those cases, it remains a death sentence. Ugandan politicians are confident that it will join them very soon. \u201cWe have been talking to the MPs and we have mobilized them in big numbers,\u201d said Lokodo. \u201cMany are supportive.\u201d He is reportedly \u201coptimistic\u201d that it will pass with the required two-thirds majority.\n\nThe bill may again trigger an international outcry. When President Museveni signed the 2014 bill, a wave of retaliatory measures strangled the country\u2019s economy. The United States, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and The World Bank suspended or redirected aid in the wake of the decision. Under this intense economic duress, the Ugandan government eventually paid a Washington-based lobbying firm millions to \u201cclear [its] image.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a concern,\u201d Lokodo admitted, \u201cbut we are ready. We don\u2019t like blackmailing. Much as we know that this is going to irritate our supporters in budget and governance. \u2026 We can\u2019t just bend our heads and bow before people who want to impose a culture which is foreign to us.\u201d\n\nNotably, Uganda has recently spoken in support of other human rights abuses; in particular, the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. In a statement issued on October 4, the country\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it \u201cfirmly supports the One country, two systems policy of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the matter of Hong Kong and other areas.\u201d Uganda is the only nation currently to vocally condemn the peaceful pro-democracy protests against communism in Hong Kong, though other nations have stood by silently in the wake of extreme police violence by the Chinese state.\n\nWithout legitimate recorse, Pepe Julian Onziema of the advocacy group Sexual Minorities Uganda is concerned, as are many other members of the country\u2019s LGBT+ organization alliance. \u201cHundreds of LGBT+ people have been forced to leave the country as refugees and more will follow if this law is enacted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will criminalise us from even advocating for LGBT+ rights, let alone supporting and protecting sexual minorities.\u201d", "description": "Ugandan President Museveni's administration announced that they will resurrect a bill that puts a literal death sentence on homosexuality.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/uganda-homosexuality-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
