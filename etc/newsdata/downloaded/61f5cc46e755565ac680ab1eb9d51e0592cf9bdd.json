The Democrat, whom he named \u201cUrban Guy\u201d, was trying to convert the Donald Trump supporter (\u201cFlyover Man\u201d) to his low view of the president. Flyover Man was resisting. Park for a moment any reservations you might have about entering the realm of Brooks\u2019s imagination and praise the man for at least owning his column\u2019s fictional status. Per the conventions of the genre, he could have put the quotes in the mouth of a \u201ccab driver\u201d and claimed the entire exercise as a piece of reporting.\n\nInstead, boldly, Brooks let us in on his screenplay in progress. He is hardly a stranger to negative attention: think of the outcry over a column he wrote about class and sandwiches a few years ago, in which he pitied a poorly educated friend for freaking out in the face of the word \u201csoppressata\u201d.\n\nThe opinion writer summonsed the kind of limp puppet characters that political strategists mistake for real people\n\nHow low the stakes were back then. Now, generating dialogue like an AI screenwriting program set to mild rightwing bias, we are treated to this kind of exchange: \u201cIf people like you are unable to acknowledge my dignity and see my problems, I\u2019ll stay with Trump,\u201d says Flyover Guy.\n\nUrban Guy, bumptious and condescending, is not having this. \u201cI hope you read the rough transcript of that Trump phone call with the Ukrainian president,\u201d he says, with a snottiness that would make the hand of the most ardent Bernie supporter twitch for a moment over the ballot paper. Really getting into role a few beats later, our hero adds, \u201cHe lies with abandon. He slanders and insults. He pollutes the water near and far,\u201d before breaking character and saying, very much as Brooks himself, \u201cthe cultural liberalism you preach but don\u2019t practice is leading to the breakdown of families\u201d. Cheers, David!\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s all very jolly. Contrary to the howls of protest about the idleness of Brooks fabricating views when he might have left the office to seek them out from real people, one is left feeling grateful to the man for the small joy of his absurdist break from the news.\n\nHunter Biden is a reminder: Democrats are morally corrupt, too | Hamilton Nolan Read more\n\nIt is also, perhaps, a foreshadowing of the Trump era productions to come. Gary Shteyngart, in his excellent novel Lake Success, had a crack at the run-up to the Trump election; obliquely but devastatingly, the TV show Succession is nailing, weekly, the cultural context in which amoral billionaires prosper, as well as turning around an amazingly nimble subplot on #MeToo.\n\nFor anything longer range, we will have to wait. It still feels to me as if the great 9/11 novel hasn\u2019t arrived yet and any decent state-of-the-nation Trump fiction is likely to be a long time coming. In the meantime, thanks is due to the opinion writer who can summons, in a half-arsed way, the kind of limp puppet characters political strategists mistake for real people while delivering a timely public service: another warm reminder that reporting matters.\n\n\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist", "description": "A bizarre Trump take in the New York Times shows the value of reporting, says Guardian columnist Emma Brockes", "authors": ["Emma Brockes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d163056235646ba9e7dfad64411aaa6bebb6f53c/0_218_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4d9bd9b3c18e32dd9ffd954c6c08c235", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
