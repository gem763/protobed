SHE NEEDS TO BE IN PRISON FOR LIFE! pic.twitter.com/iiShKgmkPL \u2014 StanceGrounded (@_SJPeace_) September 26, 2019\n\nThe video was shared to social media, including by Shaun King and Patricia Arquette, and viewed millions of times.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department confirmed with Yahoo that a hate incident report was filed on Wednesday. They would not confirm whether Patton could possibly be facing jail time, but they did say they would talk with people and perform a thorough investigation.\n\nOn Thursday, Patton issued an apology on her Instagram, writing in her profile bio: \u201cPlease do not contact me. I was intoxicated and I sincerely apologize to everyone whom I disrespected and let down for my actions. Please forgive me.\u201d\n\nShe added in stories, \u201cI hope the world knows we all as human beings have made mistakes and gratefully regretted them later in life. I as a human made the choice to say some words that I should\u2019ve NEVER let come out of my mouth. I will no longer ask for forgiveness because what I did as a human was very inhumane and disgusting. African Americans help build this very country that I am living in and I hate that I insulted the millions of them. I have lost my job which I totally would agree on as well for the reason I have been let go. People allow me to rekindle the love we shall all share amongst each other.\u201d\n\nThe CVS tirade is reportedly not an isolated incident. A neighbor of Patton and her husband of nine years, who wanted to be identified as Tony, told KTLA that she has a history of racist outbursts and erratic behavior.\n\n\u201cWe had to file restraining orders against her and her husband for warning to threaten us, to assault us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were yelling racial slurs,\u201d\n\nTony, who is of Italian decent, claimed Patton told them to go back to their country. He also provided that station with security footage that showed Patton threaten to slit someones\u2019s throat and an altercation between a man and woman.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A hate incident report was filed to the LAPD after Heather Patton went on a racist rant at a CVS.", "authors": ["Megan Sims"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ILYkiZhQrFKwK.VORgbHBg--~B/aD05NDQ7dz04OTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/72d4c150-e0bc-11e9-bfbf-99e4ae33d316", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
