The projected deficit would be the highest since 2009/10.\n\nIt is then seen widening further, to 6.5% in 2020/21, the highest since the Treasury started presenting the consolidated fiscal framework in 2002/03.\n\nGross government debt was projected to rise from an estimated 60.8% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 71.3% in 2022/23, the Treasury said.\n\nSouth Africa is struggling to gain economic growth momentum, with the growth outlook clouded by a lack of significant progress on long-promised reforms.\n\nThe rand weakened more than 1% against the dollar after the budget numbers were published.
