The reason is that the property owners are not coming on board. There are lots of property owners we cannot find. That leads to these buildings becoming more derelict.\"\n\nShe said the poor condition of the buildings led to an increase in crime because people were invading them.\n\n\"Buildings have to be safe. We are here to take care of the community. We are strengthening interventions and the CPFs are working quite well.\"\n\nShe said more Metro Police would be deployed to the area once a recruitment process was completed.\n\nWhen asked if there were any intelligence driven operations or actual programmes to clean up the area, Peer was vague.\n\n\"Crime is a national question. We do have organised crime criminals who work in and around the area. We are having a problem with drugs. We have formed a drug unit within the Metro Police. We have made a number of busts. I have asked for statistics here. We will intensify our interventions.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "The demolition of  buildings in the Durban Point precinct will turn the area into a premier tourism destination for the city, acting mayor Fawzia Peer said on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7688/88111fc465cf4b739286b1e6b0f0c881.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-26"}
