Marnie (Lysette Anthony) supports her in regards to the funeral arrangements, and they\u2019re both left stunned when Tony\u2019s dad, Edward turns up without any notice. As a result, Diane wastes little time in sending him packing.\n\nHowever, Edward\u2019s not one for giving up, and thus he turns up once more the following day \u2014 and Finn (Keith Rice) grows rather suspicious of him \u2014 but he simply claims that he wants to help in Tony\u2019s absence, and begs Diane to give him a chance. Later, at The Dog, Marnie and Cindy (Stephanie Waring) are smitten when Edward enters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetermined to prove himself, Edward comes up with a plan to help Diane when she says that she needs time to be herself again, and thus he arranges for Nancy (Jessica Fox), Mandy (Sarah Jayne Dunn), Darren (Ashley Taylor Dawson) and Cindy to come round to the flat so that she can have some adult company for the evening.\n\nLater, Luke (Gary Lucy) arrives and clashes with Edward. What\u2019s more, Edward undermines Finn on a number of occasions too, so it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s a force to be reckoned with.\n\nYes, it doesn\u2019t take long for Edward to get his feet under the table, and before long he makes quite the impression on everyone.\n\nThe question is: is Edward simply there to help out in Tony\u2019s absence? Or is there a more sinister reason for his presence in the village?\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\nOne to watch: Friday 18th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "He makes quite the impression on the residents of Chester!", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/JOE_010-104d_1570796050.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
