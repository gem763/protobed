Can\u2019t Ignore Kashmir Anymore", "language": "en", "text": "Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, was a man on a mission at the United Nations, imploring members last week to persuade India to lift its siege of Kashmir, a longtime flash point between the two nations, which both have nuclear weapons.\n\nFailure to do so, he warned in a speech before the General Assembly on Friday, could result in war between the neighbors if Kashmiris push back against the suffocating presence of thousands of Indian troops.\n\nSince Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister of India, revoked the semiautonomous status of the Muslim-majority state on Aug. 5, his government has imposed a curfew and detained nearly 4,000 people, including lawyers and journalists. There have been serious allegations of torture and beatings. India cut phone and internet service, leaving millions of people isolated.\n\nWhile Mr. Modi didn\u2019t address the issue in his United Nations speech, at a rally in Houston a few days earlier he said that revoking the constitutional clause on Kashmiri autonomy meant \u201cpeople there have got equal rights\u201d with other Indians now. That\u2019s an absurd assertion to make about a state in the world\u2019s largest democracy that\u2019s essentially under martial law.", "description": "As India cracks down on a long-disputed region, two nuclear powers face off.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/opinion/02kashmirprint/02kashmirWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
