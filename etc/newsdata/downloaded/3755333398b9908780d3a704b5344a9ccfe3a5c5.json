He is still writing his own story ... he\u2019s going to be one of the greats.\u201d\n\nWith England having moved Manu Tuilagi into the number 12 shirt, it is Kerevi not Petaia who will directly face the powerhouse centre but team mate Matt Toomua said the teenager enjoyed his defensive duties.\n\n\u201cI think 13 is probably his favourite position so that\u2019s good, closer to the action, he can get some ball,\u201d said Toomua, who is a close family friend and has known Petaia since he was a toddler.\n\n\u201cHe gets excited both sides of the ball, which is unique for a young guy - loves defence and loves attack, loves the rough stuff.\u201d\n\nCheika, who was going to give Petaia his debut last year against Italy only for injury to intervene, said he had been impressed by the way the youngster carried himself.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a good young rugby player, he\u2019s pretty relaxed but he\u2019s very well prepared,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe gives off the demeanour of being very cool and chilled but he\u2019s very well prepared both off the field and getting ready tactically and physically.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a great demeanour and I like him.\u201d\n\nCheika said he had \u201cinfinite trust\u201d in Petaia and not for a minute considered leaving him out of the team for such a big match.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be looking at the age of players at either end of the spectrum,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou just go and play footy you know. Yes, it\u2019s going to be fast and aggressive and all that type of stuff and I know that lad will rise up to that challenge. I know it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it in him, so I know he will on Saturday.\u201d", "description": "Australian coach Michael Cheika's mantra is \"bring something different\" and he stuck resolutely to it on Thursday when he named teenager Jordan Petaia as starting outside centre for this weekend's World Cup quarter-final against England.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441883178&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G18P-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
