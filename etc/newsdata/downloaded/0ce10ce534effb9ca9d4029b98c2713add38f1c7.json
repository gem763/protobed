Here's How That Could Play Out in the Courtroom", "language": "en", "text": "A new 33-patient case study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine provides some of the strongest proof yet that exposure to asbestos-tainted talcum powder may cause malignant mesothelioma, a rare and deadly cancer that affects tissues lining internal organs.\n\nThis isn\u2019t only an important scientific discovery\u2014it could also give new ammunition to plaintiffs in the thousands of cases brought against brands selling talcum-powder-based products alleged to cause cancer, like Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard, in general, to prove exactly what caused your specific case of disease,\u201d says Steve Gold, a professor at Rutgers Law School who specializes in toxic and hazardous substances. \u201cIf a credible physician and researcher is willing to testify and has published that these individual cancers appear to be caused by asbestos exposure from talcum powder, that\u2019s evidence that is usually not available to plaintiffs. That\u2019s very powerful.\u201d\n\nAsbestos is a group of naturally occurring fibrous minerals that\u2019s considered a human carcinogen by the World Health Organization and other public health groups. It is linked to mesothelioma, ovarian cancer and lung cancer. Among other places, it\u2019s found in building supplies, insulation, some car parts\u2014and the talc from which talcum powder is made. (Talc also turns up in cosmetics like blush and facial makeup.) Since the 1970s, manufacturers have pledged to use talc that is free from detectable levels of asbestos, but there is still little regulation over the cosmetic industry, and concerns about asbestos contamination persist. A bombshell 2018 Reuters report also found that J&J knew for decades that some of its Baby Powder was tainted by asbestos, but did not report that information publicly or to federal regulators.\n\nJ&J has also for years been under fire in the courtroom. In March, for example, a California jury awarded more than $29 million to a woman who claimed talcum-powder-based J&J products contributed to her mesothelioma. The year before, a jury ordered J&J to pay more than $4 billion in damages to a group of women who claimed its products caused them to develop ovarian cancer. And in 2016, the consumer products giant was ordered to pay $55 million to a woman who said Baby Powder contributed to her ovarian cancer.\n\nJ&J has refuted and, in many cases, appealed those decisions, citing conflicting evidence on whether talcum powder can cause cancer. In a statement provided to TIME after the new study\u2019s publication, the company maintained that Baby Powder is safe.\n\n\u201cWe sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer, and we understand patients and their families are seeking answers. The facts are clear \u2014 Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos nor does it cause cancer, as reflected in more than 40 years of scientific evidence,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThere have also been many jury verdicts in favor of the company on these issues, including two in the last week.\u201d (On Oct. 9 and Oct. 11, separate California juries sided with J&J in cases alleging that its products caused mesothelioma. On Oct. 15, a Missouri appeals court overturned a $110 million verdict against the company, handed down in 2017 after a woman claimed J&J\u2019s products caused her ovarian cancer.)\n\nPeter Bicks, outside counsel for J&J on talc litigation, also noted that study co-author Jacqueline Moline, a professor of occupational medicine, epidemiology and prevention at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health, has served as a paid witness in asbestos lawsuits and in the study drew on cases referred to her by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys.\n\nMoline emphasized the study\u2019s importance. \u201cThis is the first time that anyone has said, \u2018Let me look at all these cases, put it all together and identify the ones where [talc] is the sole exposure,'\u201d Moline says. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t even aware that cosmetic talcum powder might have had asbestos in it.\u201d\n\nIn the paper, Moline and her colleagues present case studies of 33 people, mostly women, who were confirmed to have malignant mesothelioma, and whose only substantial exposure to asbestos was through the use of talcum powder\u2014theoretically ruling out other causes of the disease, since asbestos exposure is the primary risk factor for malignant mesothelioma. (All of the people profiled in the study gave depositions as part of lawsuits related to cosmetic talc.) The authors broke out in particular detail the cases of six individuals, all of whom underwent tissue testing that showed fibers consistent with the type of asbestos found in cosmetic talc, but not in things like building supplies and insulation. Some of these people used products containing talcum powder daily for decades.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It could give plaintiffs new ammunition", "authors": ["Jamie Ducharme"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RH1bPcC4xHYPHqASyEzSfg--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/1b73fa07920ece058e504a0f57207a58", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
