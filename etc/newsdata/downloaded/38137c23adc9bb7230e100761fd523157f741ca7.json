I hate it as much as peanuts. But I can\u2019t stop eating peanuts.\u201d\n\nOl\u2019 Orson might be surprised how many viewers in 2019 are drawn to watching shows for the sole purpose of loathing them (\u201chate-watch\u201d being a common verb), or that TV as we know it now serves up peanuts eight, 10, 12 bowls at a time. \u201cModern Love\u201d is eight deadly episodes long. You won\u2019t notice its effects until it has already poisoned you, and if you watch all of them and find it in any way pleasing or relatable, then I\u2019m afraid to say it\u2019s over between us. (It\u2019s not me; it\u2019s you.) If, however, you watch the show as a means of bile deployment, then scooch over and let\u2019s not enjoy it together, two shriveled hearts cuddled as one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor those who are blissfully unaware, \u201cModern Love\u201d appears Sundays in the Times\u2019s Styles section, where it began 15 years ago this month, featuring hideous yet often compelling personal essays by different authors, freelancers and everyday schmoes, each of whom feel some need to tell the rest of us about a time when they discovered certain profundities in their various relationships \u2014 from chance encounters, to bitter breakups, to deathbed revelations.\n\nTidy to a fault, a \u201cModern Love\u201d essay is for people who think they are too smart for platitudes or perhaps even too smart for rom-coms. A lot of these stories are often about a threesome, of sorts, involving the narrator, the object of their desire and that annoying third wheel in the relationship: the city of New York.\n\nIt is on this point that the TV version of \u201cModern Love\u201d is most annoying, relying on the permanent delusion that New York makes people fall into a special kind of love, unattainable anyplace else (unless on a brief trip abroad). It\u2019s the neurotic, entitled sort of love we used to find in Woody Allen movies, before we dumped him, only the show\u2019s executive producer, John Carney (who also wrote and directed most of the episodes), has added an extra tang of disinfectant. Some New Yorkers still fall for this crap, that the city is merely the perfect backdrop to the story starring them. Watching \u201cModern Love\u201d is about as much fun as listening to a New Yorker complain about not being able to find a good bagel or a decent slice. Like I said, it\u2019s a hate-watch.\n\nAs with the column, each episode features a different tale and different pair of co-stars. This first batch is drawn from \u201cModern Love\u2019s\u201d least complex, easily smarmified examples, launching with Cristin Milioti as a single, young woman whose suitors never meet the approval of her overprotective doorman (Laurentiu Possa); it gets cutesy when she gets pregnant and decides to raise the baby on her own. In New York, you see, doormen exist to become supportive father figures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe next episode stars Catherine Keener (\u201cModern Love\u201d is full of actors you like, doing things you don\u2019t like) as a New York Times Magazine writer (I mean, c\u2019mon) who teaches a young tech guru (Dev Patel) about the fleeting nature of lost love and how to head off a lifetime of regrets.\n\nWhat seems to be the series\u2019s nadir comes early: Anne Hathaway, giving her annoyingest all as a bipolar woman who, in her more manic moments, imagines life as one musical number after another. Some will say it\u2019s a thoughtful and brave performance. And some will not. But things actually get worse, when poor Tina Fey and John Slattery act out a dull tale of marital dissatisfaction (written and directed by \u201cCatastrophe\u2019s\u201d Sharon Horgan) that is solved by . . . playing tennis.\n\nAs you watch along (perhaps asking if Matthew Weiner didn\u2019t already kinda-sorta do a lot of this last year with his disappointing \u201cRomanoffs\u201d series), you begin to anticipate which of \u201cModern Love\u2019s\u201d standard themes will get the treatment: Do they do the one about the couple (Sofia Boutella and John Gallagher Jr.) whose first date ends up in the emergency room? (Of course!) What about the one where the young woman (Julia Garner) craves the fatherly attention of her older male boss (Shea Whigham) without realizing she\u2019s leading him on? (Could a future \u201cModern Love\u201d season be based entirely on performative essays reduced to daddy issues?) What about the drifter-hipster homeless woman (Olivia Cooke) who picks two fussy gay men (Andrew Scott and Brandon Kyle Goodman) to adopt her baby? (Yes, it\u2019s here, too.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat about something really icky, like getting Jane Alexander to play a woman who finds and grieves true love at an advanced age? They\u2019re all here, so shallow that they threaten to turn into commercials for fabric softener.\n\nOr, speaking of the blatantly commercial, perhaps you remember that series of Taster\u2019s Choice instant coffee ads from a few decades ago, where the elegant strangers meet cute and invite each other in for a cup? That\u2019s all \u201cModern Love\u201d really is \u2014 only colder and more crystallized.\n\nModern Love (eight episodes) is available for streaming Friday on Amazon Prime.
