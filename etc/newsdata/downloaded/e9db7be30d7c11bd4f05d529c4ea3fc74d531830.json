REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\n\u201cWe both are nuclear-armed countries. If these tensions increase, the world could be in danger,\u201d Khan said, addressing members of the Sikh religious community in the eastern city of Lahore. \u201cThere will be no first from our side ever,\u201d he said.\n\nTension remains high in Kashmir, where security forces have used tear gas against stone-throwing protesters and the valley remains under lockdown after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s decision to withdraw special rights for the Muslim-majority state on Aug. 5.\n\nBy stripping Indian-controlled Kashmir of its special status, New Delhi blocked the region\u2019s right to frame its own laws and allowed non-residents to buy property there. Delhi said the change would help Kashmir\u2019s development, to the benefit of all, but its move angered many residents of the region and was strongly condemned by Pakistan.\n\nKhan has so far focused on a global diplomatic campaign condemning India\u2019s actions, accusing Modi of committing human rights violations and atrocities in the valley.\n\nHe has also said frequently that any misadventure between two nuclear-armed nations could endanger the world.\n\nMuslim-majority Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan. Both countries rule parts of Kashmir while claiming it in full. Two of the three wars they have fought have been over it.\n\nAlso on Monday, Islamabad gave a consular access to an Indian who was given a death sentence for spying by a Pakistani military court, which the International Court of Justice asked Pakistan to review in mid-July.\n\n\u201cPursuant to the decision of the International Court of Justice, Pakistan provided consular access on 02 September, 2019 to India for Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav, Indian spy, serving Indian Naval officer,\u201d a Pakistani foreign office statement said.\n\nThe statement said that at India\u2019s request, there was no restriction on the language of communication and the access was recorded, which continued for two hours.\n\nAn Indian external affairs ministry statement said \u201cJadhav appeared to be under extreme pressure to parrot a false narrative to bolster Pakistan\u2019s untenable claims.\u201d It said Delhi would wait for a detailed report to determine the extent of conformity to the ICJ directives.", "description": "Pakistan would not use nuclear weapons first, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday, amid tensions with arch-rival India after New Delhi revoked the special status of its part of the disputed Kashmir region.", "authors": ["Asif Shahzad", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425426236&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8117H"}
