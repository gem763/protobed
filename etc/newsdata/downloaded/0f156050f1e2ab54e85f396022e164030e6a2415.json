That could change.", "language": "en", "text": "There\u2019s a growing movement to make open-captioned (OC) film screenings more widely available for deaf and hard-of-hearing moviegoers, which would probably mean that some hearing moviegoers might occasionally, and possibly inadvertently, have to sit through a movie with on-screen subtitles they don\u2019t need. Open captioning refers to dialogue that appears on the screen; closed captioning (CC) refers to the more common electronic devices \u2014 headsets, small displays that are mounted on the theater seat back, etc. \u2014 that are required by law to be made available for individual moviegoers upon request.\n\nBut those devices, which are notoriously cumbersome and prone to dead batteries and missing dialogue, are roundly derided by those who have to use them. Allie Serd, a Chicago-based moviegoer in her 30s who has worn hearing aids since she was 9 and who began using CC devices in 2013, says she has largely given up on them. A bad experience this spring at \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d may have been the last straw.\n\n\u201cI go to customer service and they never really do anything,\u201d Serd says. \u201cThey just throw free movie tickets at me. This doesn\u2019t really solve the problem. I let them go to waste.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, convenient OC screenings can be nearly impossible to find. Under the theory that hearing audiences don\u2019t want them, theaters often require a minimum number of tickets to be sold before they\u2019ll even consider showing a movie with open captioning. And when they do so voluntarily, many won\u2019t schedule them during prime moviegoing times \u2014 evenings and weekends.\n\nIn Washington, D.C. Council members Charles Allen, Anita Bonds, Brianne K. Nadeau and David Grosso have co-sponsored a bill that would change that. The Open Movie Captioning Requirement Act of 2018 would require D.C. theaters to offer open-captioned screenings at times when most people prefer to go to the movies. In a statement from the National Organization of Theatre Owners, spokesman Patrick Corcoran called the bill an \u201cuntested mandate,\u201d noting that the movie theater business already operates on a thin profit margin. This summer, the trade organization, made up of independent theater operators and national chains, launched a pilot program increasing the number of open-captioned screenings at D.C. theaters to assess whether \u201cthe market can sustain a higher number of open-captioned screenings.\u201d\n\nBut wait, that\u2019s a good thing, right?\n\nNot according to Erik Nordlof, the founder of the open-captioning advocacy group DC Deaf Moviegoers.\n\n\u201cOn the face of it, the program is a good start to provide access voluntarily,\u201d Nordlof says. \u201cBut it is ultimately a way to delay passage of legislation and to try to find justification to oppose it, especially considering that the program\u2019s design ensures that the majority of OC screentimes are not available to most deaf and hard-of-hearing moviegoers.\u201d\n\nAccording to data collected by Nordlof\u2019s group, during the first four weeks of the pilot program \u2014 which is scheduled to run through the end of the year \u2014 60 percent of OC screenings were not held on Saturday and Sunday, and a majority of the weekday screenings were scheduled at inconveniently late or early times. Nordlof says he thinks that poor attendance at these screenings could be used as ammunition to defeat the bill.\n\nCorcoran disputed Nordlof\u2019s characterization, saying that nearly three-quarters of the OC shows were available during the evening and on weekends.\n\nTempers are boiling over.\n\nIn 2018, model, actor and deaf activist Nyle DiMarco tweeted an image of a closed-captioning device \u2014 obscuring a large chunk of the movie screen \u2014 with an invitation to retweet his post \u201cif you prefer open captioning to this.\u201d\n\nA barrage of responses followed, including from many hearing moviegoers who simply don\u2019t mind \u2014 or actively like \u2014 subtitles, and who use them at home. One such moviegoer, Sarah Feisthamel, an Albany, N.Y., resident whose post-traumatic stress disorder makes her sensitive to loud noises and who routinely uses captioning at home, recently started a petition on Change.org, asking Marvel Studios to release next year\u2019s \u201cEternals\u201d movie with open captioning \u2014 not just for some screenings, but for every single one.\n\nWhen the casting of the 2020 film, about a race of superhumans, was confirmed at this year\u2019s Comic-Con, there was huge excitement in the deaf community to see that Marvel had cast deaf actress Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, the first deaf superhero. In the comics, the character isn\u2019t deaf \u2014 and is also a white man \u2014 but Ridloff, who is Mexican and black, will perform the role using sign language. Ridloff is also in \u201cSound of Metal,\u201d a drama about a heavy metal drummer who is losing his hearing. That film made news at the recent Toronto International Film Festival, where its use of captioning was praised as an artistic choice. The director, Darius Marder, has said that when the film is released, all screenings will be captioned.\n\nAlthough several pop culture websites have reported on Feisthamel\u2019s petition, the odds of its success seem long. Fiesthamel had, at press time, garnered only a few thousand signatures. Nevertheless, she insists, it\u2019s not a stunt \u2014 unlike the recent petition by \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans asking producers to remake the show\u2019s last season \u201cwith competent writers.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, it looks like it\u2019s for show, but that can still change,\u201d she says.\n\nBut first, minds have to change.\n\nWhen it comes to the District\u2019s pending open-captioning legislation, council member Jack Evans was unequivocal in his denunciation, saying, \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to go to movies with captions, period,\u201d according to Martin Austernuhle of WAMU.\n\nBut who are these \u201cpeople\u201d Evans is talking about? Certainly not the deaf and hard of hearing, who have been closed out of movies for so long. And maybe not even people who, like my hearing friend Ellen, found that she had accidentally bought a ticket to an open-captioned screening this summer. After finding it annoyingly \u201cdistracting\u201d for the first few minutes, she says she eventually got used to it.\n\nThat\u2019s how all change happens \u2014 by small steps that, when strung together, become big ones. Of her \u201cEternals\u201d petition, Feisthamel believes that a sea change may be coming.\n\n\u201cThis is the movie,\u201d she says, \u201cthat starts the revolution.\u201d", "description": "Is there enough support for more open-captioned screenings?
