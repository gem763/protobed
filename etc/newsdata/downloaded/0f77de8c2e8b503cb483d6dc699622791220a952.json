The 21-year-old sweetly struck a right-footed volley to grab a rapid lead \u2014 just as Augsburg had done in the corresponding fixture last year.\n\nBayern replied as Robert Lewandowski stretched his scoring streak to eight games in the 14th minute from a Serge Gnabry cross.\n\nAfter a host of missed chances, former Arsenal winger Gnabry threaded the needle in the 49th minute to put Bayern 2-1 ahead.\n\nBut a strong, bullying run in injury time by Sergio Cordova on the wing set up Finnbogason, who finished past Manuel Neuer to earn a point for Augsburg, and put another early dent in Bayern\u2019s title defence.\n\nThomas Mueller missed two chances after coming on as a late substitute after a week of controversy over the fact he has not started a game since September.\n\n\u2013 Werner finds shooting boots \u2013\n\nTimo Werner scored his first goal in five games for Leipzig in a tight tussle against Wolfsburg at the Red Bull Arena.\n\nIt was not enough. Wolfsburg scored a late equaliser when Dutch striker Wout Weghorst finished a William cross to keep the race at the top close.\n\nWolfsburg are the only unbeaten team in the division.\n\nAt the Weserstadion, Werder Bremen opened the scoring at home against Hertha Berlin as Josh Sargent\u2019s strike took a useful deflection on its way into the net in the seventh minute.\n\nDodi Lukebakio hit back in the 70th minute for Hertha to secure a 1-1 draw. He beat three defenders, including Theodor Gebre Selassie twice, in a mazy run from the wing.\n\nUnion Berlin claimed just the second win of their debut top-flight season by beating Freiburg 2-0 at a bouncing Stadion an der Alten Foersterei.\n\nMarius Buelter gave them the lead with a long-range strike, his third goal of the season.\n\nA second goal from distance by Marcus Ingvartsen, over substitute goalkeeper Niclas Thiede, making his debut, was enough to secure victory for the home side.\n\nElsewhere, Rouwen Hennings scored a late winner to seal Fortuna Duesseldorf a 1-0 home win over 10-man Mainz.", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 Bayern Munich were denied top spot in the Bundesliga when Alfred Finnbogason\u2019s injury-time equaliser snatched Augsburg a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/b0a7ff_bayern-boss-niko-kovac-saw-his-drop-points-in-bundesliga-bayern-slip-up-as-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
