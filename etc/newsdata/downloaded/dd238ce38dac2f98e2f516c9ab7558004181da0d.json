In all, some 2.35 million customers from 38 counties would be affected by the outages, per AP.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), the largest utility in the state, has been criticized by lawmakers for the way it has handled the power shutdowns. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) told a news conference on Saturday that \"the scale and scope\" of PG&E's blackout decision \"is clearly unacceptable.\"\n\nSen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo), who's been appointed to a panel reviewing the PG&E blackouts, told the NYT the courts should \"take control of the company before more damage is done.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Parts of the Bay Area, wine country and the Sierra foothills were forecast to face gusts of 60-80 mph, as well as low humidity forecast to sweep across the state. PG&E began to cut power to 940,000 properties in a new round of shut-downs\n\nIn Sonoma County, some 50,000 residents were under evacuation orders over the Kincade fire, which the New York Times reports had \"consumed 25,955 acres\" as it continued to spread after starting on Wednesday. Firefighters had contained 11% of the blaze by Saturday night, per the LA Times.\n\n\"Southbound traffic on Highway 101 backed up for miles leaving Healdsburg, where popular boutiques and farm-to-table restaurants were deserted just after noon,\" the Times reports.\n\nWhat they're saying: Newsom said at Saturday's news conference, \"The next 72 hours is going to be challenging. I could sugar-coat it, but I'm not [going to].\"\n\nMichael Lewis, PG&E's senior vice president of Electric Operations, said, \"This wind event is forecast to be the most serious weather situation that Northern and Central California has experienced in recent memory.\"\n\nThe big picture: PG&E has turned off the electricity twice in recent weeks, aiming to prevent wildfires during high-wind periods and dry spells. PG&E's latest round of shut-offs was expected to occur in stages.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with the latest details on the evacuations and power outages and further comment from California lawmakers and forecasters.", "description": "Several areas face possible \"historic\" winds this weekend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/nFmD36uTlHxd0AQGsCF0jwmMv0o=/0x0:5000x2813/1920x1080/2019/10/26/1572122479270.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
