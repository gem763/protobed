Despite the carnage, the White House announced that American commandos quickly confirmed Baghdadi\u2019s identity by combining facial-recognition technology and fast DNA analysis.\n\nThe near-instant forensic analysis appears to be a dramatic demonstration of new capabilities U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) developed in part to address ambiguities that resulted from the commando raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011.\n\nMost importantly, a new, smaller and much faster DNA-reader that troops can haul into combat aboard their helicopters and use while the smoke from combat is still clearing.\n\nActing on fresh intelligence regarding Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts, U.S. forces based in northern Iraqi piled into helicopters and, as President Trump announced, flew \u201cvery, very low and very, very fast\u201d to Idlib in western Syria.\n\nAs the Americans cleared Baghdadi\u2019s compound, killing what Trump described as \u201ca number\u201d of ISIS fighters, Baghdadi himself fled into a tunnel with three of his children. \u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down,\u201d Trump noted in a rambling press conference on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cHis body was mutilated by the blast. The tunnel had caved in on it. But test results gave certain immediate and totally positive identification. It was him.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s head reportedly remained intact following the blast. Using a biometric facial-recognition scanner, the Americans \u201cimmediately identified\u201d Baghdadi, Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin reported.\n\nSince the early days of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S. forces have built up huge databases of terror suspects\u2019 faces, iris patterns and fingerprints, and used an ever-improving series of handheld scanners to match detainees with suspects\u2019 profiles. Most recently, the U.S. Army began studying ways of gathering \u201cvoiceprints\u201d in order to identify terrorists by the sound of their voices.\n\nThe commandos in the Baghdadi raid didn\u2019t just rely on these biometric signatures to confirm the target\u2019s identity. The White House in a statement said, \u201ca combination of visual evidence and DNA tests confirmed Baghdadi\u2019s identity .\u201d\n\nUntil recently, a conclusive DNA test could take weeks as analysts at a laboratory dissolved organic samples in special reagent chemicals, sifted out waste materials in order to isolate the DNA then copied the strands in order to produce an easily-readable baseline.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department has worked hard in recent years to speed up DNA processing, specifically in order to quickly identify terror leaders who might not survive swift, violent commando raids.\n\nShortly after U.S. Navy SEALs killed bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011, American officials delivered a sample of the terror leader\u2019s remains to a U.S. military DNA lab in Afghanistan, The Washington Post reported. There, military specialists confirmed bin Laden\u2019s identity. The chance of an error was \u201capproximately one in 11.8 quadrillion,\u201d an intelligence official told the newspaper.\n\nBut Pentagon leaders wanted Special Operations Forces to be able to identify terrorists on the spot in the heady hours following a raid\u2014no time-consuming shipments to DNA labs required.\n\nIn 2015, SOCOM officials revealed that commandos had begun using two new types of a small and portable DNA lab: the RapidHIT 200 from California-based IntegenX and the DNAscan from NetBIO in Massachusetts.\n\n\u201c We want something that doesn't take a Ph.D. to operate, obviously. We have knuckle-draggers out there that are operating these things. \u201d \u2014 Michael Fitz, former manager of SOCOM\u2019s special surveillance program\n\nThe two DNA-readers work like the bigger, traditional laboratory-based systems do, but with very small, precisely measured quantities of chemicals and a wireless connection to a DNA database. Both new readers weigh around 100 pounds and are the size of a copy machine, making them small enough to fit on a helicopter.\n\nThey both require just one, moderately-trained operator. Use a cotton swab to soak up some spit or blood, slip the swab into a plastic sleeve, insert the sleeve into the machine and press a few buttons. Less than two hours later, the machine spits out a strip of paper listing any matches.\n\n\"We want something that doesn't take a Ph.D. to operate, obviously,\" said Michael Fitz, then the manager of SOCOM\u2019s special surveillance program. \"We have knuckle-draggers out there that are operating these things.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the instant DNA-scanners were expensive at around a quarter-million dollars per unit. \u201cWe\u2019re saving it for the juicy missions,\u201d Fitz said. At the time, SOCOM hoped to work with industry to shrink the mobile DNA-scanners down to just five pounds.\n\nThe command reportedly hoped to get the smaller scanners by 2019 or 2020. It\u2019s unclear whether the more compact devices were available for the Baghdadi raid. SOCOM did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nRegardless of size or quickness, a DNA reader is only as good as the data available to it. Sure, you can read a terror suspect\u2019s DNA. But you have to compare it to a known sample of the suspect\u2019s tissue in order to be sure you have a match.\n\nTo confirm bin Laden\u2019s identity, the U.S. intelligence community reportedly piggybacked on an immunization drive in Abbottabad shortly before the May 2011 raid. The immunization effort could have allowed U.S. operatives to collect samples from bin Laden\u2019s family members.\n\nBut as of 2015, the Pentagon didn\u2019t possess a large database of terror suspects\u2019 DNA. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been collecting DNA, in part because it\u2019s been a cumbersome and lengthy process to do that,\u201d Fitz explained at the time. The military\u2019s DNA database in 2015 was \u201cnot robust, not populated with the people we\u2019re interested in,\u201d Fitz added.\n\nIf U.S. commandos did indeed quickly confirm Baghdadi\u2019s identity by way of his DNA, it\u2019s because they already possessed a sample of the ISIS leader\u2019s tissue. Citing an unnamed U.S. official, The Washington Post reported that special forces were able to obtain the DNA they needed to identify Baghdadi voluntarily from one of his daughters.", "description": "New technology includes a smaller and much faster DNA-reader that troops can haul into combat aboard their helicopters and use while the smoke from combat is still clearing.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572222776/191027-dna-check-tease_j2pkuv", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
