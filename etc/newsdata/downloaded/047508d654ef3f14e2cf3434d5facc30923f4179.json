In the 1790s, conservative Federalists worried that their more democratic Jeffersonian rivals wanted to bring French-style revolution to the country. At their most extreme, archconservatives such as Timothy Dwight warned that Jeffersonians were under the sway of the Bavarian Illuminati, an international conspiracy aiming to overthrow Christianity.\n\nThe Jeffersonians claimed that the Federalists were conspiring to destroy the republic and erect an aristocracy in the US. The degree to which either side believed what they were saying about their rivals has been hotly debated by historians ever since. Did Federalists just use the spectre of the Illuminati to tar their rivals? Or did they mean it? Did the Jeffersonians really think the Federalists were conspiring to bring back monarchy as they alleged? Or were they just trying to win elections? The answer depends on who and when, but it's safe to say that some did believe these theories.\n\nAmerican partisans continued to find conspiracies at work throughout the 19th century. Supporters of president John Quincy Adams (Adams' son) believed that a secret cabal had contributed to Adams' 1828 defeat at the hands of Andrew Jackson. The author of an 1835 political history of Jacksonianism warned on the first page, \"We are admonished by history, that the principal dangers to popular governments arise from the interference of foreign nations, either by force or fraud, in their concerns; or from the corrupt ambition of their own citizens seeking exclusive and forbidden powers.\"\n\nCasting a paranoid eye\n\nBut this conspiracy theory itself spawned others: One angry reader accused the book of being \"a hodgepodge of misrepresentation + invective,\" written by \"the most abandoned malignant slanderers ever sold to perdition\". To this reader, the book must have been \"brewed in Wall-street, that hotbed of bank tyranny\". Only a conspiracy, ginned up for partisan effect, and personal profit, could have led to such ideas about Jackson.\n\nConspiracy theory after theory, Americans cast a paranoid eye on their partisan opponents throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" first appeared in the early 20th century US, in the context of political histories of the 19th century. The phrase increased in popularity during the McCarthy era that inspired Hofstadter to coin the term \"paranoid style\" during lectures he gave at Cambridge University in 1958 and 1959, and expanded upon the concept in a November 1964 essay in Harper's Magazine on the rise of the far-right wing of the Republican party.\n\nDemocrats' anxieties about Russian conspiracies to interfere in the 2016 campaign cannot be extricated from this historical context of paranoia just because they have a significant basis in fact. As Joseph Heller wrote, \"Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow Democratic charges of a Russian conspiracy have provoked Republican countercharges of a Ukrainian conspiracy tied to former vice-president Joe Biden. This new conspiracy theory, which makes false claims about the vice-president's interference in Ukrainian politics to protect the business interests of his son, appears to sceptics to be the malicious invention of Republican political hacks, designed to weaken Biden's presidential candidacy.\n\nAccording to recent reporting, tales of corruption by Biden and his son Hunter originated with Peter Schweizer, a conservative writer and editor at large for Breitbart. Schweizer is also president of the Government Accountability Institute, an opposition-research operation founded by Stephen Bannon and funded by the billionaire hedge-fund magnate Robert Mercer, Trump's largest contributor. Schweizer is a longtime pusher of conspiracies about liberals. He published a book in 2018 titled Secret Empires, which included a chapter about the Bidens in Ukraine.\n\nThe most eager consumer of this new Ukrainian conspiracy theory featuring the Biden family has been Trump, who has endangered his own presidency with his efforts to promote it. With Trump's apparent approval, his personal lawyer and political operative Rudy Giuliani has not only worked with journalist John Solomon, a former Washington Post reporter who was just hired by Fox News Channel, to spread the story, but also with two Soviet-born business executives, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, to encourage Ukrainian connections to generate more information to feed the conspiracy theory.\n\nConspiracy-mongering\n\nSome commentators view Trump as breaking from the past, with his ready willingness to fuel conspiracy theories to motivate voters to support him and his party. They point to how much this diverges from presidents in recent decades.\n\nBut a more nuanced appraisal would situate Trump in the long history of peddling conspiracy theories in American politics. Instead of representing a massive departure, Trump's deviation from the past is far more slight: he's conspiracy-mongering while his party largely controls power. Typically it is members of the party out of power who push conspiracies.\n\nThe republican political theory underlying the American paranoid style had its origin in the writings of opposition politicians in 18th-century Britain. Since then, conspiratorial thinking has remained most attractive to opposition parties seeking to discredit their establishment rivals. This is the nature of Trump's criticism of Democratic investigations of Russian conspiracies to hack the 2016 campaign. They're just whining because they lost, Trump has said repeatedly.\n\nThis may be the norm, but Trump's continuing embrace of conspiracy theories while in office can still be explained by the history of political conspiracy thinking. When parties in power \u2013 such as the Federalists in the 1790s \u2013 start to feel their grasp on power slipping, they, too, travel down the road of conspiracy-peddling.\n\nAnd today, Trump and his supporters may be right to perceive themselves on the defence, as changing demographics and social norms make the continuing domination of American politics by white men like themselves less assured. If Trump's embrace of the Ukraine conspiracy doesn't sink his political future by leading to impeachment, it may nonetheless signal that his political future is bleak.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The fear of sinister foreign influence didn't start with Trump, Russia, and Ukraine.
