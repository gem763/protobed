'Every single one. I mean, that is very rare. That speaks to severe borderline personality disorder.'\n\nSo insecure was Geradot's wife over what was happening with her estranged husband she began using disguises and concealed recording devices to track the pair.\n\nShe knew that her husband and Chapman had been secretly seeing each other shortly after she hired him to work under her in the marketing department at University of Delaware in November 2017.\n\nBefore the murder-suicide took place, Gerardot said he and his wife had arranged a set time to talk specifically about Chapman.\n\nHe learned that during one call Jennair was at a firing range.\n\n'I can't picture her there. I can't picture her buying a gun,' Gerardot told Dr. Oz. 'We were as anti-gun as anybody.'\n\nMark Gerardot (above right) with his wife Jennair. The couple 'were happy' the now widower says, but the marriage had its problems\n\nA 15-page letter revealed Jennair had borderline personality disorder, a mental health disorder characterized by unstable moods, behavior and relationships\n\nDuring an episode of ABC's 20/20 last month, Gerardot admitted that he became smitten by his new, younger boss, before they began seeing each other.\n\nHe also said that while he and his wife 'were happy' when they married in 1993, they still had their problems.\n\nThe couple could have 'epic' fights, he said, and that she always had to 'have the last word.' They also had some financial struggles.\n\nWhen Chapman, who also was in a marriage that was heading towards divorce, came into his life, Gerardot said it felt 'amazing to be around her.'\n\n'I was confused by the feelings I was having, to be honest,' he said, 'until it became a little bit more forward with a dinner that we had. It was more of a date.'\n\nJennair Gerardot picked up on the affair after her husband relocated for the new job from their home in South Carolina. She had stayed behind to lease the house.\n\nMark Gerardot said he spent 45 days alone in Delaware, and that his wife, upon rejoining him, noticed he had become distant.\n\nMark Gerardot admits that he became smitten by Meredith Chapman (above), 33, after she hired him to work under her in a marketing job at University of Delaware, that it felt 'amazing to be around her'\n\n'She finally asked me, \"What is up with you? You're acting different,'' he recalled. 'She said specifically, \"It's Meredith, isn't it?''\n\nThe husband said he had mentioned Meredith's name to Jennair previously, but only in a professional context.\n\nAt first he denied the affair. But his wife persisted in her inquiries.\n\nFinally, as Valentine's Day approached, he admitted he was seeing Chapman.\n\nShe then made her own admission, he said, that she had hired a company that gave her access to his phone. The wife could read all his text messages, see his photos and review records of calls with Chapman.\n\nThe couple made an attempt to reconcile with couple's therapy. However, during their second session, Mark Gerardo says he stumbled on a flashing recording device, sewn into his jacket.\n\nPictured above, Mark and Jeannair Gerardot. The now-widower said she signaled trouble was coming by texting him, 'You ruined my life,' and 'I hope you find never happiness,' the evening she shot dead his mistress and then herself. She ended with one final message, 'Bye, Mark'\n\n'She told me she wanted to understand the degree to which Meredith and I were in the relationship,' Gerardot said. 'She was determined there was a plan between Meredith and I, and she was trying to listen to what that plan was.'\n\nThe husband said divorce after that was inevitable and that he within a short time he announced his intentions to file.\n\nChapman, meanwhile, was married to Luke Chapman, a former Newark city councilman.\n\n'I broke her heart,' says Mark Gerardot in an ABC interview last month, referring to his wife, Jennair, who police say shot her husband's mistress before turning the gun on himself.\n\nJennair Gardot (above left), 47, shot dead her husband's mistress Meredith Chapman (above right), 33, before shooting herself in what police concluded was a murder-suicide\n\nTheir divorce was official by the time Chapman moved to Radnor Township and accepted a position at Villanova University.\n\nSheila Brennan, a divorce coach who began working with Jennair Gerardot, said the wife was boiling with resentment and anger over 'being tossed away' and 'being traded in' for a younger woman.\n\nShe also worried about money, because she had just moved from South Carolina, and had not found new employment after a job loss.\n\nMark Gerardot said his wife at one point threatened to jump out a window.\n\nShe seemed to improve after he said he urged her to seek professional help and support from her family. But quietly she was keeping close tabs on the husband and his mistress, and plotting revenge.\n\nDisturbing text messages the wife sent the husband on the same night of the the murder-suicide signaled trouble was coming.\n\nIn a letter to his dead mistress, Mark Gerardot says he tells Meredith Chapman (above) that it should have been him that died, not her. He says he's also writing a book, which is proving cathartic\n\n'You ruined my life,' one text message said, according to Mark Gerardot.\n\n'I hope you find never happiness,' she said in another text, ending with one final message, 'Bye, Mark.'\n\nAfter the shootings, Mark Gerardot said he began writing to help recover from the tragedy.\n\nIn a letter to his dead mistress, he says he tells her that it should have been him that died, not her. He says he's also writing a book, which is proving cathartic.\n\nGeradot expresses remorse over the tragedy.\n\nAs for his dead wife, 'my regret comes back to breaking her heart and making her feel like she had no other choice,' he said.\n\n'I broke her heart,' he says, referring to Jennair in the ABC interview.\n\n'I wish I wouldn't have hurt her because I loved her. I still love her. I wish I could take it back.'", "description": "Mark Gerardot revealed to Dr. Oz his wife Jennair had a backup plan for to kill all three of them including his lover Meredith Chapman, 33.
