Some will now likely continue operating until they are over 60 years old in the 2030s and 2040s.", "description": "In a referendum, the Swiss have voted against a proposal that would have accelerated the closure of the countries five nuclear plants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/350818/1000x563_350818.jpg", "published_at": "2016-11-27"}
