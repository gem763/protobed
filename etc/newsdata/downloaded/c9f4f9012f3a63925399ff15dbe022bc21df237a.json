She joined Dean in February 2018 and had previously worked for consumer-goods company Henkel AG & Co. and PepsiCo Inc., according to a securities filing.\n\nThe company appointed Gary Rahlfs as interim finance chief. He has worked as senior vice president focused on finance and strategy at Dean since May 2019. Mr. Rahlfs also has served in executive roles at the University of North Texas and PepsiCo, the company said. Dean has lost about two-thirds of its market value this year amid falling prices for milk and weaker consumer demand. Shares fell 4.3% Tuesday to close at $1.33. Dean hired a new chief executive, Eric Beringause, earlier this year. Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
