Do we not have a duty to our constituents and to the country to let this matter rest?'\n\nMr Bercow hinted he could block another vote being held as he replied: 'I am alert to the argument you have made.\n\nMr Bercow, pictured in the House of Commons yesterday, told MPs he would 'make a ruling on Monday' on whether the vote could proceed\n\n'I think the fairest thing to say is that, as I have been advised by the Clerk, a ruling on Monday on this matter would be sensible.'\n\nIf the 'meaningful vote' is allowed to go ahead tomorrow then rebel MPs are likely to try to table a similar amendment to the one which was agreed yesterday.\n\nThat amendment, brought forward by former Tory Sir Oliver Letwin, withheld support for the PM's deal until such a point as the government has passed all of the legislation needed to deliver an orderly Brexit.\n\nThe government is expected to table the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the draft law that will do exactly that - tomorrow with the first of a series of votes likely to be held on Tuesday.", "description": "John Bercow and Boris Johnson are on a collision course this evening ahead of a crunch showdown in the House of Commons tomorrow.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/18/19961386-0-image-a-27_1571591446957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
