You didn\u2019t specify it\u2019s the one from the end that you pick.\u201d\n\nYep.\n\nMatt said he just likes to be \u201csuitably vague.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to keep the audience guessing, it would be boring if it was too easy wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nWell then.\n\nThe Bachelor continues 7.30pm Wednesday and Thursday on Channel 10.", "description": "This week a publication has hinted that Matt Agnew\u00a0may have already called it donezo with the woman he chooses... for the runnerup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-16-at-3.04.40-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
