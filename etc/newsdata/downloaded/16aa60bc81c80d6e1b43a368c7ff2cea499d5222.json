If this is serious, then this person needs help. If she wanted to get ratioed, mocked, and create a ruckus, then she certainly succeeded. Apparently, wearing red baseball caps is a triggering experience for Rebecca Makkai and she warned that it scares other people. Even baseball caps that aren\u2019t political are not worth wearing because they trigger liberal America. I mean this is just weakness. And people wonder why the far left isn\u2019t taken seriously and seen as antithetical to liberal democracy. According to them, you can\u2019t say certain things\u2014they have speech codes\u2014and you can\u2019t even wear certain things. That\u2019s not American. If you have a problem with someone wearing a Make America Great Again hat, that\u2019s your problem. This isn\u2019t an emergency. There are no laws being broken. So, good patriots, wear those MAGA hats with pride because this is just un-serious in the extreme.\n\nIs anyone else made really uncomfortable these days by anyone wearing any kind of red baseball cap? Like, I see one and my heart does weird shit and then I finally realize it only says Titleist or whatever. Maybe don't wear red caps anymore, normal people? \u2014 Rebecca Makkai (@rebeccamakkai) September 1, 2019\n\nAlso, for the love of God: The clever folks wearing \"Make America Read Again\" or whatever caps -- NO. You're making everyone scared. Don't do it. \u2014 Rebecca Makkai (@rebeccamakkai) September 1, 2019\n\nIf you\u2019re here to be contrary: an equivalent here would be western Hindus choosing not to use the swastika symbol in public despite it being sacred to their faith because it would offend/frighten people. The red hat has become a symbol of hate bc of how its wearers act. \u2014 Rebecca Makkai (@rebeccamakkai) September 1, 2019\n\nAlso, for the love of God: The clever folks wearing \"Make America Read Again\" or whatever caps -- NO.
