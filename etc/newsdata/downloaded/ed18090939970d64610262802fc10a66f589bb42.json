They were right.\n\nRevealed during the Marvel Games panel at New York Comic-Con, Kamala Khan is indeed the voice narrating the original trailer, and she\u2019s much more than that as well. In the latest trailer for the game we see her confronting Bruce Banner and Tony Stark with evidence that could prove the tragic events from the game\u2019s opening were a setup.\n\nNot only does the character, voiced wonderfully by actor and singer Sandra Saad, urge the team to reform, she\u2019s also a playable character. See her in action in the new trailer below.\n\nIt\u2019s about damn time Ms. Marvel gets her due. I call dibs on playing her when Avengers launches on May 15, 2020. While we wait, here\u2019s some behind-the-scenes.", "description": "The first trailer for Square Enix\u2019s upcoming Avengers game featured a female narrator that many fans thought sounded a lot like Inhuman fangirl Kamala Khan, AKA Ms. Marvel.
