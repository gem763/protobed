The string of weak data had sharply raised market expectations of additional interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had such a string of bad news, that anything that shows the economy is doing better than perhaps people have been talking about is well received,\u201d said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.\n\nMSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.36%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 132.15 points, or 0.5%, to 26,333.19, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 13.37 points, or 0.46%, to 2,924 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 33.50 points, or 0.43%, to 7,905.77.\n\nBond yields were little changed, suggesting that investors remain concerned about the U.S. economy. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 5/32 in price to yield 1.5187%, from 1.536% late on Thursday.\n\nTalks between Beijing and Washington will resume next week to work towards a truce in the protracted trade spat between the world\u2019s two largest economies, although hopes of a definitive agreement are pretty low.\n\nTraders see a 85% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points to 1.75%-2.00% in October, up from 39.6% on Monday, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool. FEDWATCH\n\nThe Fed has already cut rates twice this year as policymakers try to limit the damage caused by the bruising trade war.\n\n\u201cThis [jobs] data probably reinforces the case that the U.S. is now beginning to feel the effects of the ongoing global slowdown and probably strengthens the case for additional rate cuts, if the Fed chooses to go down that path,\u201d said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nGlobal equities could fall as much as 15-20% if negotiations break down and President Donald Trump follows through with his threat of car imports tariffs, UBS global chief investment officer Mark Haefele warned on Friday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 2, 2019.
