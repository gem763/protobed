But the central issue was Turkey's insistence that there could be no open-ended truce.\n\n\"The make-or-break point in the meeting was when Erdogan demanded a deadline if they wanted the operations to be paused,\" he said. \"Erdogan said it could be 24 or 48 hours. Pence said it was a very short frame and he couldn't make that decision by himself.\"\n\nWith the Turkish president refusing to give ground, the issue was taken up in a second, expanded meeting.\n\n\"Following discussions, a deadline of 120 hours was agreed on. Once this was settled, there was fast progress on other issues,\" the official said.\n\nA senior U.S. administration official said: \"At one point, Erdogan asked how long it would take (the) YPG to pull out and we (the U.S. delegation) took that as a glimmer of hope that the Turks were open to a deal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBREAKING THE ICE\n\nPictures of the start of the meeting between the U.S. vice president, an evangelical Christian, and the Turkish president who leads a party with Islamist roots, suggested an awkwardness between the two men.\n\nBut early in the conversation Pence told Erdogan that Trump \"liked, respected and valued\" him, according to the Turkish official, an introduction which he said \"warmed the atmosphere\".\n\nAt another point in the talks, when Turkish officials cited their battle casualties in the week-old military operation, Pence told them there were military veterans in the U.S. delegation and his own son was in military service.\n\nHe conveyed U.S. condolences to those killed and to their families, a gesture which the U.S. official said appeared to move a Turkish general in the meeting.\n\nThose personal connections may have helped ease some of the tensions in a relationship frequently characterized by uncompromising rhetoric from both sides.\n\nThe agreement has de-escalated tensions in the north of Syria, but there are signs the temporary truce remains fragile.\n\nOn Friday morning, shelling could be heard near the Syrian town of Ras al Ain close to the border with Turkey, although Reuters journalists in the area said the bombardment subsided by mid-morning.\n\nAnd there was confusion over how big the \"safe zone\" is that Turkey intends to secure. Erdogan said the swathe of land ran 440 km from east to west, but U.S. special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, said the accord covered a smaller area.\n\nOn the eve of Thursday's talks, the White House released a letter Trump sent to Erdogan warning him on Oct. 9 - the day Turkish troops crossed into northeast Syria: \"Don't be a tough guy\" and \"Don't be a fool\", and repeating a warning that Trump could destroy Turkey's economy.\n\n\"It's really strange to talk to somebody like Erdogan in this tone, and expect him to accept this,\" a second Turkish official said.\n\nThe tone of the letter was a particular surprise in Ankara, since Turkish officials have repeatedly said that the two presidents have a strong personal bond.\n\n\"Trump and Erdogan would have made a deal sooner if it was up to Trump,\" the second official said. \"But Pence made a massive contribution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Dominic Evans; Editing by Mike Collett-White)", "description": "The surprise deal to suspend Turkey's military offensive against Kurdish-led forces in Syria hinged on President Tayyip Erdogan's demand that Washington agree a time limit on any ceasefire, a senior Turkish official said on Friday.
