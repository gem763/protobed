The race, the 17th of 21 this season, is set to go ahead as planned at 2.10 p.m. (0510 GMT) on Sunday at the Suzuka circuit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a shame for the fans but it\u2019s a fully respectable decision,\u201d said Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto. \u201cSafety is first.\u201d\n\nHagibis, which means \u2018speed\u2019 in the Philippine language Tagalog, is due to make landfall on the main island of Honshu on Saturday.\n\nIt has already forced the cancellation of two rugby World Cup matches.\n\nPredicted to be one of the most violent storms to hit the region recently, Hagibis is threatening to batter Tokyo with the heaviest rain and wind seen in 60 years.\n\nSuzuka, located about 300 km to the southwest of the capital, is also expected to be hit hard by the passing storm.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to ask the spectators to come on track and then to be in a big mess,\u201d said Alfa Romeo team boss Frederic Vasseur. \u201cWe already thought about this yesterday evening honestly.\n\n\u201cOK, it will change the programme but I think we can afford the weekend with two free practices.\u201d\n\nFormula One is no stranger to dealing with inclement weather in Japan.\n\nIn 2004 Typhoon Ma-on forced qualifying to be postponed to Sunday while another storm in 2010 similarly delayed qualifying by a day.\n\nThe 2014 edition of the race, during which Jules Bianchi suffered ultimately fatal head injuries, was held in the wet with rain from the approaching Typhoon Phanfone drenching the track.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s two practice sessions, which were run in overcast but dry conditions, teams and organisers worked to prepare for the coming storm.\n\nThe starting lights and broadcast screens around the track were taken down, the broadcast centre was dismantled and the equipment moved to the main pit building. The podium was also packed away.\n\nTemporary grandstands were rearranged so the wind would pass through them. Organisers handed out sandbags in case of flooding.\n\nTeams anchored their hospitality units down with pegs drilled into the asphalt, wall panels in the garages were being taken down, garage doors were shuttered, and pit wall gantries were secured.\n\nChampions Mercedes said they would also take down screens and speaker systems installed in their hospitality unit and lift most of their garage equipment off the floor to avoid flood damage.\n\nOrganisers said the circuit would be closed to the public and media on Saturday, but key people from the governing FIA and commercial rights holders FOM would remain at the track to make sure critical systems were kept running.\n\n\u201cThings are more complicated but certainly a great challenge,\u201d said Binotto. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure it should be a good show and spectacle on Sunday.\u201d", "description": "Formula One team bosses backed the decision of Japanese Grand Prix organisers to cancel all of Saturday's practice and qualifying sessions as the sport hunkered down to ride out Typhoon Hagibis.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439511533&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A04N", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
