Are they going to tell all the American and worldwide athletes you can\u2019t say anything anti-Xi?\u201d Scott said. \u201cUntil you become a legitimate country that is going to respect human rights and respect things you agree to, we\u2019re going to quit doing business with you.\u201d\n\nThe Republican senator also extended his criticism to Fifa\u2019s decision to award the first edition of the expanded 24-team Club World Cup to China, which is expected to be announced on Thursday in Shanghai.\n\nScott\u2019s appearance followed his letter to IOC president Thomas Bach urging the relocation of the next Winter Games in which he described the NBA\u2019s rift with China as \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d, saying the Winter Olympics \u201cwill provide the Chinese government full access to a global array of dignitaries, athletes, corporations, and governments when someone simply turns on their phone, or connects to the Wi-Fi in the hotel. That sort of totalitarian surveillance must be avoided at all costs.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Olympic Games are an incredible opportunity to allow the world\u2019s best athletes to represent their countries, and should not be hosted by Communist China and President Xi, who does not value human rights. I ask this committee to stand up for freedom and urge Communist China to do the right thing, or find a new home for the 2022 Olympic Games.\u201d\n\nBeijing narrowly won the rights to host the 2022 Olympics over Almaty, becoming the first city to be awarded both a winter and summer Games.", "description": "Florida\u2019s junior senator Rick Scott doubled down on last week\u2019s letter urging the IOC to relocate the 2022 Winter Olympics from Beijing", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bfac6f6daa3361a24280aa27d2ade1506ac992/48_0_2578_1547/master/2578.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b5e437647e6dee11a70c671bca08aa47", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
