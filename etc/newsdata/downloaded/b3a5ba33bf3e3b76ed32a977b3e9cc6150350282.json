So why is he surrounded by scandal? | David Miranda", "language": "en", "text": "There is a towering paradox at the heart of Brazilian politics: the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, was elected on an anti-corruption platform \u2013 music to the ears of a population that has been victimised for decades by systemic corruption.\n\nWho ordered Marielle Franco's murder? | David Miranda Read more\n\nBut the \u201canti-corruption\u201d president and his family are now subsumed by multiple corruption scandals suggesting serious criminality.\n\nAll three of Bolsonaro\u2019s politically active sons, along with his wife Michelle, have been implicated in corruption scandals. But the most serious and menacing scandal features Bolsonaro\u2019s eldest son, Fl\u00e1vio, who is a federal senator.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the media reported that one of Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s aides, the former military police officer Fabr\u00edcio Queiroz, had for years been depositing sums of money into Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s personal bank account. The Intercept (co-founded by my husband Glenn Greenwald) subsequently published secret chats showing that Brazilian prosecutors agreed that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that the deposits were part of a common racket in which lawmakers employ \u201cghost\u201d employees who do no work and kick back part of their salaries.\n\nBut this scandal transformed into something far darker and more grave: Queiroz, investigators have said, has ties to the violent and dangerous paramilitary gangs which now rule much of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThat Bolsonaro's eldest son allegedly has such close ties to this paramilitary gang was terrifying but not surprising\n\nWorse, for more than a decade, Fl\u00e1vio employed both the wife and the mother of Adriano Magalh\u00e3es da N\u00f3brega, the alleged leader of Rio\u2019s most powerful and violent paramilitary gang \u2013 the same gang investigators have concluded carried out the brutal assassination in 2018 of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s black, LGBT, favela-raised city councilwoman Marielle Franco. (Franco, a close friend of my family, served alongside me in the city council as a member of my party, the leftwing socialist PSOL, until she was murdered.) Fl\u00e1vio defended himself by claiming that the hiring had been \u201cat the indication of former aide Fabricio Queiroz\u201d.\n\nThat the president\u2019s eldest son allegedly has such close ties to this paramilitary gang was terrifying but not entirely surprising. These \u201cmilitias\u201d, as they are known in Brazil, are largely composed of former and current members of the military police and military.\n\nBolsonaro, a former army officer, has a history of praising these militias as well-intentioned vigilante groups dedicated to fighting crime. All three of his politician-sons \u2013 including his youngest political son, Eduardo, a former member of the federal police \u2013 have also praised these militias. Along with an anti-corruption persona and a demonisation campaign against LGBT people, Bolsonaro has made pledges to unleash the police and military to kill more suspected criminals central to his political platform.\n\nStill, the fact that Bolsonaro\u2019s son \u2013 a member of the most powerful political dynasty in Brazil \u2013 would be employing family members of this particular Rio militia shocked the nation. And those ties were even more disturbing when it became clear that Queiroz, the aide that Fl\u00e1vio claimed was responsible for hiring the family members of that militia, is linked to Bolsonaro and his wife, too.\n\nOne of the unexplained deposits made by Queiroz includes one made to the personal bank account of Bolsonaro\u2019s wife, Michelle. And photos revealed that Queiroz, aside from being Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s close aide for a full decade, seemed to enjoy a close friendship with Bolsonaro himself.\n\nWorse still, a photo surfaced in March showing Bolsonaro grinning and draping his arm around one of the former police officers who is suspected of murdering Marielle Franco. That same week, Brazil learned that Bolsonaro\u2019s youngest son, Renan, had dated the daughter of the other police officer arrested for Marielle\u2019s murder.\n\nAs the investigation into Fl\u00e1vio unfolded, the police attempted to interrogate Queiroz about how he could have come into possession of sums of money far in excess of his income as a political aide and former police officer. But after a bizarre television interview in which he vaguely claimed that he had become rich by virtue of his love for \u201cbuying and selling\u201d used cars, Queiroz disappeared completely: hidden in a neighborhood controlled by the same militia that murdered Marielle.\n\nBolsonaro has repeatedly used \u2013 or abused \u2013 his powers as president to block the investigation\n\nThe phrase \u201cWhere is Queiroz?\u201d has become a taunting internet meme used to symbolise the criminality at the heart of the Bolsonaro family as well as a protest against the stalled, and perhaps deliberately impeded, police investigation, which to date has arrested no one. Brazil\u2019s largest news magazine, Veja, recently published a cover story announcing that, unlike the Rio police, it had succeeded in \u201cfinding Queiroz\u201d: living in a wealthy neighborhood near Brazil\u2019s most expensive private hospital, where he regularly goes for treatment.\n\nBolsonaro has repeatedly used \u2013 or abused \u2013 his powers as president to block the investigation into the still-mysterious deposits made into the bank account of his eldest son and his wife. The president has all but relinquished his reputation as an anti-corruption crusader with his now-obvious fixation on ensuring that no investigation is permitted to proceed.\n\nBolsonaro has removed officials from the branch of the federal police investigating Fl\u00e1vio and Queiroz. He is threatening to change the leadership of the Rio branch of the federal police and replace them with loyalists to his family. He has stripped the agency that discovered Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s suspicious financial movements of virtually all of its authorities. He appointed as chief prosecutor a man who is openly critical of the anti-corruption investigation that S\u00e9rgio Moro led. And just last month it was reported that Bolsonaro had a meeting in the presidential palace with the lawyer representing Fl\u00e1vio in the corruption investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolsonaro\u2019s other son, the city councilman Carlos Bolsonaro, is under investigation for the same kickback scheme of which his older brother is suspected. And Bolsonaro\u2019s attempt to appoint his son Eduardo as Brazil\u2019s ambassador to the US has been widely viewed as corrupt if not an illegal act of nepotism.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s carefully cultivated image as a political outsider vehemently opposed to corruption was always an obvious myth. He is the opposite of an outsider: before his election as president, he had been a congressman for almost 30 years, closely connected to the Rio de Janeiro political machine.\n\nBrazilians rally to clean beaches amid outrage at Bolsonaro's oil spill inaction Read more\n\nBut Bolsonaro\u2019s extremist ideology and his propensity for garnering attention through outlandish statements (such as proclaiming that he would rather learn his son was dead than gay, and explicitly praising the torturers of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship) did relegate him to the fringes of political power in Bras\u00edlia. That is what allowed him to claim the mantle of outsider and frame himself as an adversary of systemic corruption rather than what he seems to be: a direct beneficiary.\n\nAny lingering doubts about the legitimacy of this anti-corruption image are being quickly dispelled by his personal involvement in these corruption scandals and his devoted obstruction of all investigations involving himself and his key family members. Just nine months after being inaugurated, polls now show that he is plagued by historic levels of unpopularity for a first-year president.\n\nAs has happened in so many other countries in the democratic world, including in the US, an \u201coutsider\u201d president elected on promises to \u201cclean up\u201d rampant political corruption has proven even more corrupt than those he denounced.\n\nBrazilians have always known that Bolsonaro is a demagogue and extremist. But these scandals and his attempts to keep them concealed are now making it clear to all but his most devoted followers that he is at least as corrupt and friendly to criminal elements, if not himself a criminal, as the scoundrels who have dominated the country\u2019s politics for decades.", "description": "Brazil\u2019s president and his family are subsumed by multiple corruption scandals suggesting serious criminality", "authors": ["David Miranda"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3572c605085030aa4c9a578cd94963f6ce836fe/0_118_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ae09bf1d8b987db437bf29e2f76f011b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
