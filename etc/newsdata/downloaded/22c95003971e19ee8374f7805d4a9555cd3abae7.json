thanks to scientists who have been surveying the crater of the asteroid that killed them.\n\nA team led by Sean Gulick from the University of Texas has put together the following sequence of events that wiped out the creatures which ruled Earth for 180 million years in a matter of minutes.\n\nTwo days before impact\n\nAround 66million years ago, the asteroid that was days away from killing the dinosaurs would have appeared in view of Earth as a small bright light.\n\nCLICK ON THE SUN FOR MORE\n\nIt wouldn't have appeared to be moving but would have been getting brighter, according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe nine-mile wide asteroid called Chicxulub will soon crash into Earth and change the course of history forever.\n\nOne hour to go\n\nAt this time, Earth would have been alive with an abundance of creatures on both sea and land.\n\nThe dinosaurs, such as the Tyrannosaurus rex and Giganotosaurus, would have been going about their day.\n\nHowever, the scientists think they would have been able to see what looked like two Suns in the sky as the asteroid approached.\n\nTwo minutes to impact\n\nThe asteroid would have flown over the South Atlantic.\n\nIt would have looked just like a fireball, appearing much brighter than the Sun now and burning at 20,000 degrees Celsius.\n\nFive seconds before\n\nThe asteroid blasts a hole in the Earth's atmosphere causing a global supersonic shock wave.\n\nIt's traveling at 45,000 miles per hour at this point and appears as a bright flash of light.\n\nImpact\n\nThe asteroid smashes into Earth with an explosion that's a billion times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.\n\nIt impacts on the shallow waters of what is now the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.\n\nThis creates a crater that's 100 miles across and 20 miles deep.\n\nThe asteroid is vaporized sending 25trillion tons of space rock debris into the atmosphere.\n\nOne minute after\n\nMolten material has now been blasted into the atmosphere at speeds of more than 100,000 miles per hour.\n\nSome even hit the Moon.\n\nThe burning debris coming from the newly formed Chicxulub crater is now hotter than the Sun so everything nearby is on fire.\n\nDinosaurs nearby would have starting boiling and bursting open with steam as temperatures reached over 300 degrees Celsius.\n\nOther creatures would have been incinerated instantly.\n\nA huge tsunami that's hundreds of feet high then forms.\n\nTwo minutes after\n\nWildfires and other huge craters start to form due to pieces of rock from the explosion falling back down to Earth.\n\nThe Earth's surface would have been moving sporadically at this point causing big creatures to tumble.\n\nSmaller early mammals would have been looking for safe places to shelter at this point and may have been burrowing or hiding under rocks.\n\nThree minutes after\n\nMighty Tyrannosaurus rexes 2,000 miles north of the impact zone are falling in the Earthquake and smashing their skulls open.\n\nShifting sediments are already burying the dead creatures, which would later become evidence of this catastrophe.\n\nFive minutes later\n\nIn North America, quetzalcoatlus, a flying dinosaur with a wingspan of 36feet, would have been shot out of the sky by glass 'bullets'.\n\nThese bullets would have been made as molten rock that was flung into the atmosphere begins to fall back down to Earth.\n\nAs it forms, it begins to cool, forming a glass-like substance.\n\n30 minutes after impact\n\nThe huge tsunami that was created earlier, hits coastlines at 100 miles an hour.\n\nThis would have extinguished forest fires.\n\nThe Chicxulub crater begins rapidly filling up with seawater and then raining glass and rocks finally ends.\n\nThree hours after impact\n\nWildfires would still be burning in North America but temperatures would have been cooling down in general.\n\nDinosaurs still alive in Montana would have had their eardrums ripped apart by a deafening sonic boom.\n\nThis would have been the sound of the asteroid impact as it would take around three hours to travel 2,000 miles northward.\n\nFour hours after impact\n\nElectrical storms would now be happening all over the world and further tsunamis would have been caused by landslides and Earthquakes.\n\nIn Western Europe, earthquakes and wildfires would have been plaguing the land.\n\nTen hours after\n\nNorth America is now cooler but the air is full of smoke from all the fires.\n\nHerds of triceratops are now dead or dying in swamps.\n\nOne day later\n\nSoot and dust stop the Sun from appearing.\n\nThis is the first day of what scientists call the Cenozoic or \u2018recent\u2019 era.\n\nDebris is still flying up from the crater.\n\nFragments of it are on their way to orbit the Sun and some will land on Mars and the moons of Saturn and Jupiter.\n\nAny microbes on these fragments may now be life exported from Earth to space.\n\nOne week after impact\n\nThe sky is so dark that plants can't photosynthesize and begin to die.\n\nThis means any large herbivores that did survive the impact are beginning to starve to death.\n\nAll the creatures that have died are causing a devastating knock-on effect on the food chain for animals in the sea and on land.\n\nTwo weeks after impact\n\nAvian dinosaurs, a close relative of birds, are showing signs that they will survive the apocalypse.\n\nThe ability to fly means they could escape the worst areas, they bread faster than large creatures and adapt better to new environments.\n\nThese survivors will eventually become the millions of birds we know today.\n\nTwo months after impact\n\nThe fires have died down so Earth is now cold and dark.\n\nThe darkness from dust will continue for another two months.\n\nAny animal larger than a crocodile has been wiped out.\n\nThe atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide.\n\nAcid rain is falling and the world is much quieter than it was two weeks ago.\n\nThe dinosaurs are gone forever\n\nThe dust eventually clears and sunlight returns to the planet.\n\nEarth eventually recovers.\n\nHowever, the demise of the dinosaurs means that mammals have been given a chance to rule the world.\n\nSoon the earliest primate and our own distant ancestor forms.\n\nThe asteroid may have spelled the end for the dinosaurs but without it, we may not be here today.\n\nThis story originally appeared in The Sun.", "description": "The death\u00a0of the dinosaurs has been laid out into a detailed timeline
