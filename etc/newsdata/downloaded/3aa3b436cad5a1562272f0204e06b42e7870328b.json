U.S. gold futures GCcv1 rose 0.1% to $1,502.30.\n\n\u201cWe have news that is positive in terms of trade talks, but no actual resolution yet. The market is still a little sceptical,\u201d said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.\n\n\u201cA few things are still hanging, including a no-deal Brexit. Time is ticking but not much progress is happening. The (situation in) Hong Kong is also not resolved.\u201d\n\nEquity markets gained after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with China\u2019s top trade negotiator, while a White House official said the first day of talks had gone \u201cprobably better than expected.\u201d\n\nWhile the two sides could reach some sort of agreements on aspects such as currencies and copyright protections, they were not expected to address the most contentious issues.\n\nThe dollar, which has emerged as an alternative safe-haven during the trade war, was a shade weaker versus its rivals, helping drive gold prices higher.\n\nWith just three weeks to go before the UK is due to leave the European Union, lack of clarity on the terms or indeed whether it will leave at all also kept investors on the edge.\n\nAdding to the global uncertainty was the attack on an Iranian-owned oil tanker on Friday. The vessel was struck by two missiles off the Saudi port of Jeddah, Iranian state television reported.\n\nInvestors will also keep a close eye on any cues from the U.S. Federal Reserve, with data on Thursday showing U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in September while underlying inflation retreated, supporting expectations the central bank will cut interest rates in October. \u201cPrices are on the downside, going away from core fundamentals and reacting to sentiments. When markets move sentimentally, you can expect a wild swing in prices,\u201d said Vandana Bharti, assistant vice-president of commodity research at SMC Comtrade.\n\nGold will be find support around $1,480 in the short term and face resistance at $1,540, she added.\n\nIn other metals, platinum rose 0.4% to $903.24 an ounce, while silver rose 1% to $17.66.", "description": "Gold prices climbed on Friday, settling into a narrow range, as investors awaited more clarity on global uncertainties including trade and Brexit, helping the metal shake off initial declines driven by hopes for a breakthrough in the U.S.-China talks.", "authors": ["Arpan Varghese", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439539478&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A020", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
