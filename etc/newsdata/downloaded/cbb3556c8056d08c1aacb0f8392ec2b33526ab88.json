You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe letter will be delivered simultaneously \u2013 but before the final Brexit deadline \u2013 to Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament, as well as the European Parliament and the Consilium Building in Brussels where the European Council meets.\n\nIn addition, MPs will be sent a list of signatories to this letter from their constituencies so that they know the strength of feeling among those who elected them before any final decision is made.\n\nEven if MPs back Boris Johnson's deal in the House of Commons on Saturday, this does not kill off the chance of a Final Say referendum.\n\nCommons speaker John Bercow has said he will allow a vote today on a motion tabled by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson - if moved by the government - demanding a public vote on any change to the UK's relationship with the EU.\n\nAnd in order to implement his deal, the prime minister must secure ratification by passing a Withdrawal Agreement bill through both Houses of Parliament in what is likely to be a fiercely-fought battle over two weeks, providing many opportunities for a second referendum to be written into law.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement must also be ratified by the European Parliament before Brexit happens, putting MEPs in a powerful position to respond to appeals from the UK public not to allow a bad deal through.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
