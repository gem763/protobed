(Xie Huanchi/Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Soviet Union disintegrated, Xi Jinping said when he became the leader of the Chinese Communist Party seven years ago, because its leaders changed their ideals and beliefs too quickly and too radically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a profound lesson for us!\u201d he said in a speech to cadres in December 2012.\n\nAnd one that Xi has assiduously put into action as China moves toward a milestone on Tuesday \u2014 a huge military parade and other events to mark seven decades since the Chinese Communist Party established the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nHe learned from the Soviets not to denounce the party\u2019s elder statesman and not to try any kind of political opening.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party will reach a moment the U.S.S.R. did not: 70 years in power \u2014 one more than the Soviet Union lasted.\n\n\u201cThey have now surpassed the Soviet Union, and that really matters to these guys,\u201d said Randal Phillips, a former CIA station chief in Beijing. \u201cThey have been paranoid ever since the Soviet Union fell, so to endure for longer means a lot to them.\u201d\n\nThe parade will be a manifestation of what Xi sees as China\u2019s proper status: a strong and proud country that is not beholden to the capitalist West.\n\n[China can\u2019t control the weather for its big bash. But it\u2019s trying.]\n\nColumns of tanks and intercontinental ballistic missiles will rumble through the streets, and fighter jets and 70,000 doves will adorn the skies. Soldiers will cover exactly one meter with every two goose-steps. More than 300,000 civilians will accompany the floats in the parade.\n\nXi has ushered the Communist Party to this moment by becoming, as Richard McGregor, the author of a book on the party, puts it, the \u201creddest leader of his generation.\u201d Xi is a die-hard follower of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party and the communist canon, and a \u201ctrue believer\u201d in the party\u2019s right to rule China, McGregor said.\n\nWhen he became China\u2019s top leader at the end of 2012, many analysts and Western governments thought that Xi would be a reformer like his father, Xi Zhongxun, who was a peer of Mao\u2019s.\n\nInstead, Xi has proved himself to be much more a disciple of Mao \u2014 and therefore of Mao\u2019s inspiration, Stalin \u2014 than a follower of his father\u2019s approach. And he has made the perpetuation of Communist Party leadership his top priority.\n\n\n\nPeople at a 70th anniversary exhibition take pictures in front of portraits of Chinese leaders, including, from left, Mao Zedong, the first head of the communist Chinese state and longtime party chairman, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao and President Xi Jinping.

At every turn, he has been talking of the need to continue the \u201cstruggle.\u201d\n\nIn a bombastic speech at a Communist Party school recently, Xi impressed that message on the young officials. China\u2019s great rejuvenation could not be achieved without a \u201cgreat struggle\u201d to achieve a \u201cgreat dream,\u201d Xi said, calling on the cadres to use their \u201ccombat spirit\u201d to tackle the many challenges facing the country.\n\n[Paramount and paranoid: China\u2019s Xi faces a crisis of confidence]\n\nChina is richer and stronger than ever before. Its gross domestic product per capita has risen from about $200 at the republic\u2019s founding in 1949 to more than $10,000 per head now. The party likes to say that it has lifted 750 million people out of poverty. China now accounts for one-third of global sales of luxury goods.\n\nXi has channeled resources into modernizing the military, including building China\u2019s first aircraft carrier, and the space program. After landing a lunar rover on the dark side of the Moon this year, China hopes to send a probe to Mars next year.\n\nHe has also launched an expansionist and aggressive foreign policy centered on his $1 trillion \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure initiative.\n\nChina is now the world\u2019s \u00adsecond-largest economy and could overtake the United States for top spot as soon as next year.\n\nBut its trajectory has been far from smooth \u2014 massive famine, political chaos and the repression of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe Xi family experienced this firsthand. Xi\u2019s father was purged, and Xi was sent to the countryside, forced to dig trenches and wear a metal dunce cap. But he has said that rather than turning him against Mao, the experience was formative for him as a Communist Party cadre.\n\nMao was \u201c70 percent right, 30 percent wrong\u201d in the way he led, Xi has said.\n\n\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping arrives for the closing session of the National People\u2019s Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in 2018. (Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA second period in the republic\u2019s history came with the \u201creform and opening\u201d era led by Deng Xiaoping, which sparked China\u2019s astonishing economic transformation. But it also involved the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators who massed in Tiananmen Square and around the country in 1989, resulting in hundreds and perhaps thousands of deaths.\n\n\u201cThis anniversary is the first chance that Xi has had to really explicitly tie himself to the legacy of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s foundation of the People\u2019s Republic,\u201d said Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history at the University of Oxford.\n\nTo achieve this vision of a strong and confident China, Xi has elevated himself to the same political level as Mao and Deng, adding his name into the constitution and removing presidential term limits so he can theoretically serve indefinitely \u2014 undoing an initiative designed by Deng to ensure that China did not return to the kind of personality cult of the Mao era.\n\nTo stamp out dissent, the party has cracked down on lawyers, human rights activists and other members of civil society. It has overseen a sweeping campaign to forcibly assimilate ethnic minorities, detaining about 1 million Uighurs in re-education camps in Xinjiang. Xi has steered an anti-corruption campaign so extensive that it has led to the arrest of more than 1.5 million people.\n\n[How China seeks to suppress memories of Tiananmen]\n\n\u201cThe history of the People\u2019s Republic of China is one of aspiration, destruction, ambition, confidence and anxiety,\u201d said Klaus M\u00fchlhahn, professor of Chinese history at the Free University of Berlin.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of Chinese policy is driven by fear,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fear of losing power, of a development similar to what happened in the Soviet Union, shapes much of the policy and thinking.\u201d\n\nThat anxiety and fear are only increasing as the party faces new and significant challenges.\n\nFor starters, Xi is locked in a protracted trade war with the United States that coincides with the most rapid cooling in economic growth in a generation. Premier Li Keqiang recently said it would be difficult for China, which enjoyed double-digit growth just over a decade ago, to maintain 6 percent growth.\n\nBut Tao Wenzhao, a political analyst at the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the trade war would not influence the celebration.\n\n\u201cIf there was no trade war, we would still be celebrating,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition has become the new normal. We see it in every area.\u201d\n\nAnother problem: Hong Kong. The protests there against the mainland\u2019s efforts to exert control over the former British colony are set to come to a head on Tuesday, with a huge counter-rally planned to coincide with the parade.\n\nAs the anniversary nears, the party is doing its best to make sure the 1.4 billion people of China feel proud and remain loyal.\n\n\u201cOver the past 70 years, China\u2019s success boils down to the Communist Party\u2019s leadership,\u201d it said in a 49-page white paper published Friday hailing the achievements of the past seven decades, and particularly of the past seven years, since Xi took the reins.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese nation has risen and become prosperous, and is becoming strong, closer to the goal of national rejuvenation than ever before,\u201d it said. \u201cChina\u2019s development path will look on brighter and brighter prospects as time moves on.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nChina loves its pork.
