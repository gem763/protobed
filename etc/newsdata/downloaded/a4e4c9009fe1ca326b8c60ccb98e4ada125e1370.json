USA TODAY\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 The Baltimore Ravens used two defensive touchdowns and more of Lamar Jackson's dual threat heroics to pull off a 30-16 victory over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. In so doing, the Ravens improved to 5-2 to strengthen their standing atop the AFC North standings. Meanwhile, Seattle had its three-game win streak snapped, and the Seahawks' record dropped to 5-2.\n\nJackson rushed for 116 yards and passed for another 143 to carry the offense. It marked Jackson\u2019s second straight 100-yard rushing game and his third of the season.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the Ravens\u2019 victory.\n\n1. Win one for Earl \u2014 Earl Thomas made his highly-anticipated return to CenturyLink Field \u2014 the place where he called home for the first nine seasons of his career, earning a Super Bowl ring and six Pro Bowl appearances. The last time Seattle fans saw the free safety, he was in their uniform, riding on the back of the medical cart with a broken leg and giving coach Pete Carroll the finger. He had played despite not having a long-term contract from the team \u2014 a deal he believed he had earned \u2014 and one of his greatest fears (a season-ending injury) happened.\n\nOn Sunday, he returned as a member of the Baltimore Ravens. He had a hand in the first tackle of the game, a pass breakup and narrowly missed recovering a fourth-quarter fumble. But Thomas provided no game-defining heroics to exact vengeance on his former team. Still, he was content to serve as the cheerleader for Jackson and his teammates. On defense, Thomas would rush up and clap enthusiastically and commended any player that made a key stop. While on the sidelines when Baltimore\u2019s offense was on the field, Thomas could be seen cheering with urgency and celebrating any positive play. Jackson put his team on his back down the stretch of the game, willing them to game-clinching scoring drives. And Baltimore\u2019s defensive players did enough to limit the Russell Wilson-led Seahawks offense. New addition Marcus Peters recorded an interception returned for a touchdown in the second quarter, and Marlon Humphrey recovered a D.K. Metcalf fumble and returned it for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. So Thomas didn\u2019t have to be the X-factor. But that was just fine with him. Winning against his former team in whatever fashion necessary was all that mattered.\n\n2. Wilson wasn't at his best \u2014 Whether it\u2019s a ball fake or head bob to get a defender going one way so he can go the opposite, or his ability to locate open receivers on the run and deliver the ball with accuracy, Wilson always gives the Seahawks the chance. His receivers also have a good understanding of how to react when things break down. The plays turn to school-yard football, and Wilson manages that organized chaos so well, more often than not, allowing his unit to live to see another play. This isn\u2019t to say he\u2019s perfect. He\u2019s not immune to disjointed days. Against Baltimore, he completed just 20 of 41 passes for 241 yards, a touchdown, an interception and a 65.2 passer rating. But even so, he still manages to give his team a chance in a way that few quarterbacks can.\n\n3. Seahawks in need \u2014 Their 5-1 start entering Sunday\u2019s game ranked among the best in the league, and the Seahawks have a chance to compete with just about any team, but they do have shortcomings that will hinder them against this year's elite squads. Wilson, as mentioned, is special. But he can\u2019t do it alone, and this Seahawks offense very much could use another play-maker. They lack a player who\u2019s going to keep defensive coordinators up at night - one who can consistently win one-on-one matchups with game-changing talent. Because of that, team officials would do well to look for a trade at the deadline to give Wilson a proven No. 1 target. The Seahawks have a decent defense. They have play-makers at each level of the unit, and maybe they haven\u2019t completely gelled yet, but they have the pieces to work with. The offense, meanwhile, remains lacking, and until they get that additional piece, they\u2019ll likely come up short when matched up with teams like the 49ers and Saints in a postseason matchup.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMIkeJones.", "description": "Lamar Jackson helped the Ravens score a key win over the Seahawks by running for 116 yards and passing for another 143 to carry the offense.", "authors": ["Mike Jones", "Published P.M.
