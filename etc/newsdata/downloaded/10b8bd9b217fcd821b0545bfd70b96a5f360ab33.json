It also allows the United States to further expand a deep-water naval base on the island of Crete, used by the U.S. Navy\u2019s Sixth Fleet on Crete and install fleets of drones at the air bases.\n\nThe work will benefit the Greek armed forces, which endured budget cuts during the country\u2019s long-running debt crisis.\n\nGreece, a NATO member state since 1952, has a new strategic importance as a key partner on Europe\u2019s southern flank and the energy-rich Mediterranean Sea, officials say.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s weekend visit to Greece yielded a revised defense agreement and a warning to Turkey.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
