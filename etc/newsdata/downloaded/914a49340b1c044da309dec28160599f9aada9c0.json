All preparations for the operation have been completed\", the defence ministry said on Twitter early on Tuesday.\n\n\"It is essential to establish a safe zone/peace corridor to contribute to our region's peace and stability, and for Syrians to achieve a safe life,\" it said.\n\nAl Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Akcakale along Turkey's border with Syria, said Turkish troops and heavy weaponry were on the move on Tuesday.\n\n\"There's a lot of tension here. There are huge concerns about the security ramifications this operation could have,\" said Stratford. \"It's very difficult to predict when any military operation might start.\"\n\n'Unmatched wisdom'\n\nTrump's warning on Turkey's economy appeared aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out US forces.\n\n\"As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nLawrence Korb, former US assistant defence secretary, told Al Jazeera the president's decision was politically motivated with a 2020 election approaching.\n\n\"What this shows is that President Trump - unlike all his predecessors whether Republican or Democrat - is only concerned about himself. We have a moral responsibility to the Kurds because without them we would not have destroyed the caliphate.\"\n\nTurkish foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said it was Turkey's fundamental right to take necessary measures for its national security against \"threats\" from Syria.\n\n\"Turkey is determined to clear terrorists from the east of the Euphrates and protect its own security and survival while implementing a secure zone in order to achieve peace and stability,\" Aksoy said in a statement.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey plans to resettle two million refugees in northern Syria and Turkish media has said the draft resettlement plan involves a 151 billion lira ($26bn) construction project. Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.\n\nA Trump administration official, briefing reporters on a conference call, said 50 American troops in the region that Turkey has targeted would be redeployed elsewhere in Syria \"where they aren't in the crossfire\".\n\nThe United States has about 1,000 troops in Syria.\n\nJoshua Landis, a Syria analyst from the University of Oklahoma, said Trump's move was the latest to throw American foreign policy into disarray.\n\n\"This shows a real collapse of the foreign policy process in the White House\u2026 People are guessing what America will do next. This is clearly not good,\" he said.\n\nIran warning\n\nLandis said Trump clearly wants to end US involvement in Middle East wars, but his understanding of the complex situation on the ground is lacking.\n\n\"The trouble is he knows very little about the long history between the Kurds and Turkey. He doesn't realise how brutal the Turkish army will be once it gets among the Kurds,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, in a phone call that Tehran is opposed to Turkey's operation in Syria.\n\n\"Zarif voiced opposition to military action\" and \"urged respect for Syria's territorial integrity and national sovereignty\", he was quoted as saying in a foreign ministry said statement issued late Monday.\n\nThe Iranian foreign minister also \"stressed the need for the fight against terrorism and for the establishment of stability and security in Syria\".\n\nZarif told Cavusoglu the Adana agreement was \"the best approach for Syria and Turkey and for addressing their concerns\".\n\nAnkara and Damascus signed the agreement in 1998 to ease tensions after Turkey threatened Syria with military action if it did not expel Turkish-Kurdish rebel leader Abdallah Ocalan from its soil.\n\nCavusoglu said the Turkish operation in northeastern Syria \"would be temporary\", according to the statement.\n\nErdogan has expressed Ankara's determination to clear the Syrian border area east of the Euphrates river of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG). Turkey says the YPG is a \"terrorist offshoot\" of Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).\n\nThe United States worked closely with the YPG to recapture swathes of territory from Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, ISIS).\n\nISIL's return?\n\nThe feared Turkish invasion of northeast Syria could spark an ISIL resurgence, analysts and Kurdish forces warned, despite Ankara's pledge to prevent the fighters' return.\n\n\"The fact is that ISIS is still a threat, one that seems likely to metastasise if the SDF is forced to divert attention and resources ... to a defensive battle against Turkey,\" said Sam Heller of the International Crisis Group think-tank.\n\nWhile a Kurdish-led operation earlier this year saw the death of ISIL's territorial gains, the organisation isn't dead and sleeper cells have been active in SDF-held areas and in Syria's vast desert, where it continues to hit Syrian government forces with deadly attacks and ambushes.\n\nCharles Lister, director of the US-based Middle East Institute, accused Trump of granting ISIL \"the gift of rebirth\".\n\nThe US military has warned that, short of sustained international pressure, ISIL would soon have the ability to regroup.\n\n\"The battle against IS is not over,\" said Abdulkarim Omar, the top Kurdish foreign affairs official. \"There are hundreds of sleeper cells in recently liberated areas.\"\n\nThe SDF is now concerned the armed group could replenish its ranks by freeing thousands of fighters and their families currently held in detention centres and informal settlements in Syria's northeast.\n\nThe Kurds consistently warned they would be unable to guard ISIL fighters if their forces were busy fighting off a Turkish offensive.\n\nOn Monday, Omar noted detention centres are not heavily fortified.\n\n\"They are only buildings... In the event of any security vacuum, these criminals could have an opportunity to break free,\" he said.\n\n'Sophisticated operations'\n\nOmar also said he was concerned about displacement camps - namely Al-Hol, the largest of the settlements, which he described as a \"time bomb\".\n\nSecurity incidents have been on the rise in the crowded camp, which houses more than 3,000 ISIL families among its more than 70,000 residents, according to the Kurdish administration in northeast Syria.\n\nThe thousands of foreign ISIL brides held in Al-Hol are \"as dangerous\" as the thousands of ISIL fighters held in SDF detention centres, it said this week, noting daily killings, stabbings, and attempts to break free.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali last month said ISIL fighters \"have stepped up their regrouping efforts through women in the camp recently\".\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War last week said ISIL is bribing prison guards and raising funds to smuggle women out of camps, including Al-Hol.\n\n\"ISIS is likely preparing more coordinated and sophisticated operations to free its detained members,\" it said in a report citing incidents in which prisoners and ISIL wives managed to break free.\n\nTurkey, however, said on Monday it would not allow ISIL \"to return in any shape and form\".\n\nBut analysts argue Ankara could unintentionally help boost the armed group.\n\n\"Turkey will not intentionally target camps and prisons but it could inadvertently strike them in the process of intervention,\" Syria analyst Samuel Ramani said.\n\nHeller also said a direct Turkish attack on camps and prisons was unlikely.\n\n\"What seems more likely is that these facilities, which are already vulnerable to riots and attempted jailbreaks, will be left vulnerable as the SDF redeploys the forces securing them to fight Turkey,\" he said.\n\n\"If ISIS cadres escape in the ensuing chaos, they could catalyse ISIS operations locally. Or, if they flee the Syrian battlefield, they could augment militant groups internationally.\"", "description": "Al Jazeera confirms the movement of Turkish forces and heavy weapons along the border with Syria as operation imminent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/40b7ddb835f84d2687a07b98c1a6e8e9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
