It has sparked fierce criticism from a wide spectrum of Moroccan society, amid accusations that the authorities have abused the country\u2019s laws to target women and crack down on free speech.\n\nRaissouni was stopped outside a clinic in Rabat on 31 August by six plainclothes police officers who questioned her about whether she had undergone an abortion. She and her fiance, professor Rifaat al-Amin, were detained along with the doctor accused of performing the procedure and two clinic staff members, who told investigators they had performed a routine medical procedure on Raissouni to remove a blood clot.\n\nAfter her arrest, the journalist was forced to submit to a vaginal examination against her will to determine whether she had undergone an abortion. Despite evidence to the contrary, she faces two years in prison for having an illegal abortion and sex before marriage, which is also criminalised in Morocco. Mohammed Jamal Belkeziz, the doctor accused of performing the abortion, was previously decorated by King Mohammed VI of Morocco but now faces up to a decade in prison over the charges.\n\nCampaigners described the trial as a slap in the face to claims that Morocco is making progress on women\u2019s rights. They say that up to 800 abortions are performed daily in Morocco, where abortion is illegal except in cases where the woman\u2019s life is threatened due to pregnancy.\n\nLaila Slassi, a Moroccan lawyer, said: \u201cWe usually say that Morocco doesn\u2019t accept abortion and that it\u2019s illegal, but usually the police are fairly tolerant of it.\u201d Slassi is a founding member of the Masaktach feminist collective, whose name translates as \u201cI am not silent\u201d.\n\nMoroccan investigative journalist released after 10 months in jail Read more\n\nProsecutor Abdelslam Imani told the New York Times that it was not the case that the authorities had targeted Raissouni because of her journalism, and claimed that the clinic she visited was under surveillance to see if it was performing illegal abortions.\n\nBut Slassi said: \u201cThe fact that she is a journalist and from a family that has caused some trouble for the Moroccan regime is probably the real reason why they\u2019re using some pretext against her.\u201d\n\nShe said Raissouni\u2019s case highlighted the failure of the Moroccan state to protect women and freedom of the press. Slass said: \u201cBut these all fall under the same bigger right, which is the respect for the rule of law.\u201d\n\nLoubna Rais, also from Masaktach, said: \u201cThis is an attack on free speech using gendered law. Everybody has to understand that all Moroccan people can be victims of this thing if one day they perhaps have a political opinion that is contrary to national official agenda.\u201d", "description": "Hajar Raissouni says charges are fabricated and motivated by her work, which is critical of government", "authors": ["Ruth Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d214bf8b4714c8248c5cc6f332b7b85bce18276c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=086cbd240bd97bc95029a3a400d65750", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
