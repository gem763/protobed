(Vincent Yu/AP)\n\nTens of thousands of demonstrators took to Hong Kong streets on Sunday and marched to the United States Consulate, urging American lawmakers to pass legislation in support of the territory\u2019s democratic aspirations.\n\nThe police-sanctioned rally and march through the city center had some of the trappings of a 4th of July parade, as protesters waved American flags and played the Star Spangled Banner. Demonstrators carried red, white and blue signs calling for President Trump to \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d and chanted: \u201cFree Hong Kong, pass the act!\u201d\n\nBy early evening, groups of protesters vandalized a main subway station in central Hong Kong that was closed by police earlier in the day and set a fire around one of its entrances. Demonstrators wearing face masks and helmets smashed station windows leaving glass piled on the sidewalk. They tossed street signs and emptied trash cans down the subway stairwells and began building barricades in the streets.\n\nThe pockets of violence continued two consecutive nights of clashes, despite Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam\u2019s decision to withdraw the widely unpopular extradition bill that had originally sparked the months-long political crisis \u2014 a clear sign that her concession has been roundly rejected by the majority of pro-democracy protesters.\n\nAs dissent in Hong Kong \u2014 and the accompanying police crackdown \u2014 continues, Lam and her government will have to face the possibility of growing international criticism particularly from the United States where lawmakers have now returned from their summer recess.\n\nThe crackdown has even targeted prominent activists who have not been at the forefront of the recent protests. Former student leader Joshua Wong, who is due to visit the United States soon to testify at a congressional hearing in support of the Hong Kong bill, was arrested at the city\u2019s airport while returning from a trip in Taiwan, he said in a statement on Twitter through a legal representative on Sunday evening.\n\nWong was detained for \u201cbreaching bail conditions\u201d following his arrest last month, but said this was due to mistakes on his bail certificate. He said he expected to be released Monday but called his overnight detention \u201cutterly unreasonable.\u201d\n\nOrganizers handed a petition to a consulate official calling for the swift passage in Congress of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill that has bipartisan backing. This latest protest will likely draw the ire of Beijing, which has already accused the United States of meddling in the months-long political crisis and warned that Hong Kong is an internal Chinese matter.\n\nMembers of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China reintroduced the bill in June, days after a million people marched calling for the extradition legislation to be scrapped.\n\nThe bill would require an annual review of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong under the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. This would include the special trade and business privileges Hong Kong enjoys, separate from China. The legislation also calls for asset freezes and denial of entry into the United States for people found to be \u201csuppressing basic freedoms\u201d in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government is breaking their promises to give freedom and human rights to Hong Kong. We want to use the U.S. to push China to do what they promised over 20 years ago,\u201d said a 24-year-old protester who declined to be named. He wore a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. \u201cThe U.S. government can make China think; do they really want to lose Hong Kong?\u201d\n\n\n\nProtesters hold U.S. flags as they march from the U.S. Consulate during a demonstration on Sept. 8, 2019 in Hong Kong, China.

In the weeks between those actions, the protests expanded in intensity and scope to more broadly focus on Beijing\u2019s erosion of the \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d framework under which Hong Kong has existed since it was handed back to China in 1997.\n\nIn an indication of the growing anti-China flavor of protests, demonstrators on Sunday carried posters and stickers depicting the Chinese flag with its yellow stars rearranged into a swastika.\n\nSwastikas with the term \u201cChinazi\u201d were also spray painted in the Central district.\n\nLam\u2019s concessions, which also included beefing up the independent police oversight committee, were met with hostility among protesters, who want her to meet four other demands they have laid out. Violent clashes between police and protesters have continued. Over 1,100 people have been arrested since June.\n\nHer move to fully withdraw the bill \u201cwas a public relations exercise vis-a-vis Beijing and Washington,\u201d said Andreas Fulda, the author of a book on efforts at democratization in China and a senior fellow at the University of Nottingham\u2019s Asia Research Institute. \u201cCarrie Lam has every reason to be worried about a strong U.S. response\u201d when Congress sits again, he said.\n\n\u201cThey think that this is perhaps a tactical retreat and a way to pacify the movement, but it is so evident that it doesn\u2019t address the elephant in the room, which is the militarization of the Hong Kong Police Force,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Saturday night, protests broke out across Kowloon and the New Territories. Pockets of demonstrators staged sit-ins at and vandalized subway stations for the second night in a row. Protesters also targeted police stations and set fire to barricades in the street. Police fired projectiles to disperse the crowds.\n\nPolice did not have a figure for the number of arrests, a spokesperson said Sunday morning.\n\nEarlier Saturday, a second \u201cstress test\u201d was scheduled by demonstrators to disrupt transportation to Hong Kong International Airport but it was thwarted by police. Last weekend protesters caused massive traffic jams and rail delays on lines heading toward the airport. Police stymied Saturday\u2019s effort with officers in riot gear stationed at subway stops and ferry terminals as well as boarding buses to check for demonstrators.\n\n[Hong Kong leader fully withdraws extradition bill, but protesters say it\u2019s not enough]\n\n\u201cWe are in a very urgent situation. We need all the support we can get,\u201d said Cody a 30-year-old IT worker attending the march.\n\nThose who are pushing for a stronger U.S. government response on the situation in Hong Kong say Washington has several options, including tweaking language in the Hong Kong Policy Act in a way that would effectively limit government to government interaction and alter the U.S. economic relationship with Hong Kong.\n\nConversations have been ongoing between lawmakers and members of foreign relations committees over the summer, as Congress has been in recess, and lawmakers have been watching further developments before deciding on how actively to push the bill when back in session.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat said earlier this week that lawmakers should move to quickly advance the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said in an interview Tuesday that he would support legislation to \u201cenhance\u201d the Hong Kong Policy Act he helped to pass in 1992.\n\n\n\nA barricade burns at an entrance to a train station on Sept. 8, 2019 in Hong Kong, China. (Carl Court/Getty Images)\n\nThe push to pass the law has frustrated pro-establishment lawmakers in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, these bills targeting specific countries, they are developing countries, with dictators in those countries,\u201d said Felix Cheung, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who traveled as part of a delegation of Hong Kong lawmakers last month to Montana to meet with congressmen and senators.\n\n\u201cBut Hong Kong has been so close to the U.S., economically and socially, it has never been a target of the U.S. government, so why should they use such a particular bill to punish Hong Kong?\u201d he added.\n\nWhile leaders from both parties have been vocal in their support of Hong Kong\u2019s protesters, Trump has taken a largely hands-off response to the upheaval. Last month, he said Chinese President Xi Jinping could \u201cquickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem.\u201d Previously, he described protesters as \u201criots,\u201d a term used by Hong Kong authorities and a characterization protesters are fighting to have withdrawn as one of their demands.\n\nKurt Tong, who served as U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong until this summer, said during a speech in Washington in late July that Hong Kong was treated as a \u201csecond-tier\u201d issue by the administration, which put more focus on Iran, North Korea and the trade war with China.\n\nShibani Mahtani contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nWith Hong Kong in turmoil, questions grow over leader\u2019s refusal to offer concessions to protesters\n\nWith threats and propaganda, China tries to silence support for Hong Kong protests\n\nFirst day of school in Hong Kong brings class boycotts and more rallies\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Pro-democracy protesters want U.S. lawmakers to pass a bill punishing those who curtail Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms.", "authors": ["Timothy Mclaughlin", "Casey Quackenbush", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/50FqVb9zjTfYYrQeXU7N9Zlp22c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WQKDETWSEEI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
