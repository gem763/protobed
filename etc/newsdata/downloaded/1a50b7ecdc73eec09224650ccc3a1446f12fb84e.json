She plays Georgina Hobart, the mother of a teenager running for class president. (Beth Dubber/Netflix)\n\nReporter\n\nMore than a decade has passed since Gwyneth Paltrow founded her lifestyle brand, Goop, which began as a newsletter but expanded into a wellness empire \u2014 an oft-mocked one, as the empress\u2019s critics have frequently painted her as more of a court jester. Recall, if you will, the infamous jade eggs.\n\nPaltrow worked steadily in Hollywood throughout those years, but a recent turn on Ryan Murphy\u2019s latest project, \u201cThe Politician,\u201d reminds us why anyone paid attention to Goop in the first place: Paltrow is a star. She rises to the top of a television show that relies heavily on the screen presence of Ben Platt, an effective actor but one perhaps better suited for a stage. He plays Payton Hobart, an ambitious high schooler running an aggressive campaign for class president, and Paltrow plays Georgina, his mother and the best character on a show that has more than it knows what to do with.\n\n\u201cThe Politician,\u201d a political satire with themes reminiscent of Alexander Payne\u2019s 1999 film, \u201cElection,\u201d plays off established archetypes \u2014 and Georgina is no exception. She\u2019s a clever reflection of Paltrow\u2019s own public persona, a character who outwardly seems shallow but whose behavior suggests that there\u2019s more to her than immaculate jewel-toned dresses and a firm belief in the healing power of crystals. (This benevolence makes sense, given that Paltrow\u2019s husband, Brad Falchuk, an executive producer on the show and a frequent Murphy collaborator, wrote the role with his Oscar-winner wife in mind.)\n\n[Review: Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u2018The Politician\u2019 is cool and cynical \u2014 and difficult to fully endorse]\n\nWhen we first encounter Georgina, she\u2019s sitting on a stool in the Hobart family\u2019s luxurious backyard, painting a watercolor of a Syrian child killed in an airstrike. \u201cIt\u2019s for a series I\u2019m doing to raise awareness and money for the Syrian war debt,\u201d she says softly to her boarish twin sons, sighing but maintaining an even-keeled tone. They walk away, picking a fight with their adopted younger brother in the process, after which Georgina comforts Payton.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t teach kindness. You know? I tried for a long time,\u201d she whispers to him. \u201cCan\u2019t do much with small hearts. Hard hearts, maybe, but not small ones. I love them, don\u2019t get me wrong, I just \u2014 the love has edges. It doesn\u2019t go on and on the way my love for you does.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack about the Goopiness of Georgina\u2019s words \u2014 in addition to her questionable painting subjects \u2014 and thankfully, Murphy spends time doing so. Whereas some of \u201cThe Politician\u2019s\u201d other supporting characters get the short end of the stick, Georgina\u2019s motivations and sacrifices are laid out for all to see. Early on in the season, for instance, we discover that she has fallen in love with a woman who works at the stables (Martina Navratilova) but chooses to remain in her loveless marriage for the sake of Payton\u2019s financial security. In another particularly moving scene, she tells Payton that she is scared by how far she is willing to go to ensure that he, her favorite son, achieves what he wants.\n\nIt\u2019s plot twists galore from there on, but Paltrow\u2019s ability to project Georgina\u2019s measured resolve as well as her ethereal quality remains constant. Critics have drawn parallels between the creative styles of \u201cThe Politician\u201d and Wes Anderson\u2019s 2001 film, \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums,\u201d and Paltrow seems to borrow a bit of her past character Margot Tenenbaum\u2019s weariness with the world as well.\n\nAs Georgina, Paltrow is as captivating as she\u2019s ever been \u2014 such that it\u2019s entirely believable when her character, after telling her husband that she\u2019d like a divorce, wearily observes, \u201cThis is the fourth time somebody\u2019s jumped out of a window when I\u2019ve tried to break up with them.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nGo ahead and hate Goop.
