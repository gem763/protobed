REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\nPolice have banned the march in the city\u2019s Kowloon district, citing concerns over public safety, and a court on Saturday said the destination of the march - the main railway interchange with mainland China - could be attacked and vandalized.\n\nProtesters are still expected to take to the streets in what is seen as a test for the protest movement\u2019s strength following over four months of unrest in the Asian financial hub.\n\nThe city\u2019s subway operator MTR Corp Ltd said some services will not stop at Kowloon station, which is on the route of Sunday\u2019s march, and will again close the network two hours early by 10 pm.\n\nAt the city\u2019s high speed rail station in Kowloon several areas were closed and only passengers with tickets were permitted entry. All food and beverage outlets were also closed.\n\nHong Kong has been relatively calm in the past two weeks after violent protests fueled by the introduction of colonial-era emergency laws.\n\nA prayer sit-in on Saturday evening drew hundreds of people to the central business district, while on Friday protesters formed a human chain along the metro network. Many donned masks in defiance of a ban on covering faces at public rallies.\n\nHowever, the city\u2019s Kowloon area has been the site of some of the worst violence in recent weeks.\n\nProminent human rights activist Jimmy Sham was attacked by knife wielding men this week in the gritty Mong Kok district in Kowloon. Pro-democracy lawmakers said the attack was designed to intimidate protesters and incite violence.\n\nSham heads CHRF, one of the biggest pro-democracy groups in the former British colony, which organized million-strong marches in June and planned Sunday\u2019s march.\n\nProtesters say they will continue to urge the government to address their demands for universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into police behavior, amnesty for those charged, and an end to describing protesters as rioters.\n\nThousands of people, including families with children, have previously defied police to stage mass rallies without permission.\n\nThese have often begun peacefully but become violent at night with some protesters have hurling petrol bombs and bricks at police, who have responded by firing water canon and volleys of tear gas.\n\nHong Kong is governed under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, which permits the city freedoms not available on the mainland such as an independent judiciary. Beijing has rejected claims it is encroaching on these freedoms.", "description": "Hong Kong tightened security ahead of a planned anti-government march on Sunday afternoon, with some metro services halted and public facilities shuttering as pro-democracy leaders called on citizens to join the protest in spite of the risk of arrest.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442853425&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J00Y-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
