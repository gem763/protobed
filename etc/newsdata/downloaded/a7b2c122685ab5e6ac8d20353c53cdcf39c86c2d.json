And over Finn\u2019s three-year tenure \u2014 which included an extended visit of the juggernaut \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2014 theater has been a growth industry in the big box on the Potomac River. According to the arts center, annual theater attendance in this period has averaged 190,000 more patrons than in the previous 10 years.\n\nBehind that statistic is the fact that the number of theater performances at the Kennedy Center has been on the rise, including the Center Stage series \u2014 semi-staged versions of musicals from the past. This year\u2019s roster begins Oct. 9 in the Eisenhower Theater with \u201cFootloose,\u201d directed by its Broadway originator, Walter Bobbie. Then in January comes the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cNext to Normal,\u201d starring \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u2019s\u201d Rachel Bay Jones, and finally, in April, \u201cBye Bye Birdie.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe uptick also involves more frequent use of the 1,164-seat Eisenhower Theater for touring musicals, and longer runs for some of them.\n\nThis points to not only the health of \u201cthe road,\u201d but also the ascendance of Finn, a producer of long standing at the Kennedy Center and in New York, in deciding what shows D.C. audiences will get to see directly from Broadway, and the kinds of theater the arts center will get behind. Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter\u2019s background is in music; her deputy, Robert van Leer, has a more varied arts portfolio. Finn, though, has been given the most sway over the popular theater offerings \u2014 more so than lieutenants in the administrations of more theatrically inclined past presidents such as Michael M. Kaiser or legendary founder Roger M. Stevens.\n\nStevens was a friend and producer of some of the great talents of his time; Kaiser made his reputation in Washington on megaprojects such as the 2002 Sondheim Celebration, a stunning musical retrospective. What might be the statement theater events of the Rutter era are still being formulated. With instincts that lean demonstrably toward the commercial \u2014 and which these days almost invariably mean musical theater \u2014 Finn has favored projects reflecting a Broadway sheen. The title of his signature creation says as much.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe definitely have been bringing in more Broadway tours than before,\u201d Finn says of what\u2019s filling out the Kennedy Center bill. \u201cThis summer alone, we did \u2018Hello, Dolly!,\u2019 \u2018Aladdin,\u2019 \u2018Falsettos,\u2019 \u2018The Band\u2019s Visit,\u2019 \u2018Dear Evan Hansen\u2019 and \u2018Cats\u2019 is here now.\u201d\n\nTwo or maybe three summer shows used to be the norm at the Kennedy Center. Finn also notes the recent mounting of a play in the Terrace Theater, \u201cByhalia, Mississippi,\u201d that fulfills his agreement with the center for one \u201cself-produced\u201d play each year. This season it will be Nia Vardalos\u2019s \u201cTiny Beautiful Things,\u201d previously staged at New York\u2019s Public Theater and elsewhere.\n\nThe Kennedy Center has struggled for decades with how to forge a distinct theatrical identity. Being both a national memorial and a vast entertainment complex \u2014 in addition to a home for other performing arts \u2014 militates against sleeker definition. Finn still seems to be trying to refine his own vision, but he says he plans to expand the theater palette.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we have a responsibility to be creating theater,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to be stepping on anybody\u2019s toes, obviously. There are so many theaters that do incredible work in D.C. that I don\u2019t want to step into what they do. But I still want us to be a producing entity.\u201d\n\nThis year, Finn is bringing in a production from London\u2019s Old Vic: \u201cA Monster Calls,\u201d a play about a 13-year-old boy awakened one night by, yes, a storytelling monster. But the pickings of more serious drama are slimmer indeed. Finn\u2019s strength, though, seems to lie in other directions. The Kennedy Center, Rutter said in an interview, can rely on Finn for his deep connections to the theater community. For example, he was able to use those contacts for a special Broadway evening at the Reach, the center\u2019s new annex. The event featured composer Alan Menken (\u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d) and Broadway performers Norm Lewis, Megan Hilty, Patina Miller and Adam Jacobs.\n\n\u201cYou could never in a million years have had all five of those superstars on the stage,\u201d Rutter says. \u201cHe was able to pull that off. Before Jeffrey, we couldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\n\nOne of the most obvious benefits for the Kennedy Center has been the Broadway Center Stage series, for which \u201cFootloose\u201d will be production No. 7. For the various well-received shows in the series, presented concert-style, Finn lured first-rank Broadway talent: Ra\u00fal Esparza and Karen Olivo in \u201cChess\u201d; Lewis and Jessie Mueller in \u201cThe Music Man\u201d; Christian Borle and Mandy Gonzalez in \u201cThe Who\u2019s Tommy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the revival of \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors,\u201d Finn says he picked up the phone and called Hilty. \u201cI told Megan, \u2018You are my dream Audrey to do this production.\u2019 She was like, \u2018You\u2019re kidding me, this is a dream role.\u2019 And we\u2019re off to the races.\u201d\n\n\u201cFootloose\u201d is not particularly fondly remembered; based on the 1984 teen-oriented movie about a town that bans dancing, it opened on Broadway in 1998 and ran for 709 performances, benefiting at the time from the popularity of the title.\n\nBut Finn trusts his gut, and this show felt right for the Eisenhower. \u201cWhat I produce is what I like to see,\u201d he says. \u201cThe barometer for me is, would I want to sit through that show? Would I buy a ticket for that show?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTicket sales have been brisk for the Broadway material Finn has been championing. The gut, in other words, has been pretty good.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBeing in that rehearsal studio today, it just gives me such energy. Because I love being around the creativity,\u201d Finn says after looking over \u201cFootloose\u2019s\u201d progress. \u201cIt\u2019s been really fun watching theater grow and watching new audiences come to the Kennedy Center.\u201d\n\nFootloose, music by Tom Snow, lyrics by Dean Pitchford, book by Walter Bobbie and Pitchford.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 202-467-4600. kennedy-center.org .\n\nIn \u2018The Great Society,\u2019 history marches numbingly on, and on, and on, and on\n\nIt\u2019s a hard-knock life, but often a funny one, in August Wilson\u2019s \u2018Jitney\u2019 at Arena\n\nThis play aims to make you uncomfortable.
