Main European bourses fell a modest 0.1%-0.3% .EU after\n\nAsia had been led lower by a 1.2% slump in top Chinese shares\n\n. There was also a sharp reverse in car shares\n\nafter a Renault profit warning. .EU \"You can't get away from the fact that China is slowing, but\n\nit's not slowing more than we thought,\" said head of global\n\nmacro strategy at State Street Global Markets Michael Metcalfe.\n\n\"We know that Q4 is going to be a soft patch, but to a\n\ndegree policymakers are ahead of this, so as long as we don't\n\nhave an escalation of the trade war now I think markets can\n\nhandle it.\"\n\nIn currencies, sterling was taking a breather at $1.2850\n\n, having scored its best six-day streak in near 30 years\n\non Thursday after Britain and the EU sealed a new Brexit deal.\n\nDoubts about whether the deal will be approved in the\n\nBritish parliament were still sky high, though, with swathes of\n\nlawmakers, who are either reluctant about Brexit or worried the\n\ndeal is not a clean enough break, due to debate the deal in a\n\nrare Saturday sitting.\n\n\"Whatever was agreed last night with the EU still has to go\n\nthrough the British parliament... the uncertainty surrounding\n\nthat still hasn't changed one iota,\" said James McGlew,\n\nexecutive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut.\n\nThe euro rested at $1.1125 EUR=EBS , not far from $1.1140,\n\nits highest since Aug. 26. The dollar remained weak too having\n\nseen this week's weak retail sales data and more U.S. interest\n\nrate cut talk contribute to its biggest weekly slide since June.\n\nEARNINGS\n\nHelping to alleviate immediate trade war worries, China had\n\nsaid on Thursday that it hoped to reach a phased agreement in\n\nits trade dispute with the United States as soon as possible.\n\nInvestors were also encouraged by upbeat earnings from\n\nNetflix and Morgan Stanley MS.N , but poor results\n\nfrom International Business Machines Corp IBM.N and weak U.S.\n\neconomic data weighed.\n\nHousing starts, industrial production and mid-Atlantic\n\nfactory output all fell short of economists' expectations.\n\nReflecting the cautious mood, the safe-haven yen\n\nstrengthened, with the dollar falling 0.13% to 108.51. The yield\n\non benchmark 10-year Treasury notes edged up though\n\nto 1.764%, compared with a U.S. close of 1.755% on Thursday.\n\nEuro zone bond yields were also nudging up with German Bund\n\nyields holding at -0.40%, the highest since early August.\n\nThe Bund yield is now up 16 bps since Irish and British\n\nleaders said on Oct. 10 they saw a path to a Brexit deal, which\n\nboosted risk appetite and weakened demand for safe-haven assets\n\nlike bonds.\n\nIn commodities, oil fell on the China data, with Brent crude\n\neasing 0.52% to $59.60 and U.S. crude dropping\n\n0.19% to $53.83.\n\n\"The (China) GDP print has weighed on short-term sentiment\n\nand we have seen regional stock markets and oil contracts edge\n\nlower because of that,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market\n\nanalyst for Asia Pacific at brokerage OANDA.\n\nCrude demand growth tends to track economic growth trends,\n\nbut Halley said China's need for oil would not recede any time\n\nsoon.\n\nUnderlining that view, Chinese official data released on\n\nFriday showed robust refinery throughput in September, rising\n\n9.4% from a year earlier to 56.49 million tonnes, on increases\n\nfrom new refineries and some independent refiners resuming\n\noperations after maintenance.\n\nGold dipped to $1,488 per ounce.
