I spent the past 30 days at my favorite spot, a particular seat in a Brooklyn park that snakes along the East River. It\u2019s not the world\u2019s greatest park \u2014 more of a desultorily landscaped sidewalk \u2014 but it offers a few things that are rare in New York City: plentiful seating, seemingly zero supervision, and an array of genuine organic smells (river, plants).\n\nThe coolest thing about the park is the gentle social engineering of the furniture arrangements. Each piece of bolted-down seating offers a unique opportunity for engagement. There are options for people who want to face north, south, or west, and for people who want to gaze at shrubbery, ferries, or other people. There are chaises for people who want to lounge alone, chair-and-table pairings for people who want to eat alone, multi-chair-and-table pairings for people want to eat with other people, benches for people who want to sit with other people, and my favorite situation: three individual chairs that are oddly close to one another without actually touching, for people who are averse to benches but still want to be within grazing distance of a stranger. All last month, I sat in one of those chairs and waited to see if anything interesting happened. Nothing did, except the books.\n\nIn the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado\n\nMemoir, November 5\n\nIn the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado I\u2019m wary of any book described in its marketing materials as \u201cprismatic\u201d for the same reason I\u2019m skeptical of foods described as \u201cdeconstructed\u201d in restaurants. The original version is usually better. But I would not have Carmen Maria Machado\u2019s memoir any other way than how it is: the recollection of an agonizing relationship in 146 chapters (I think I counted right), each of which advances the story through a different trope. There\u2019s a noir chapter, a road-trip chapter, a confession, a stoner comedy, a soap opera, a picaresque, and so on. The bildungsroman chapter is about the teenage Machado\u2019s confusing relationship with an associate pastor at her church and how it lays the groundwork for future \u2014 also confusing \u2014 relationships. The spy-thriller chapter is about harboring a terrifying secret. The romance-novel chapter is about saying I love you. Here\u2019s the tale. In grad school, Machado meets a charismatic blonde waif and the two fall in love. Everything starts well, but soon \u201cincidents\u201d begin to accrue around the girlfriend: tyrannical jealousy, gaslighting, a hostile grabbing of the wrist, the slamming of household things, the targeted throwing of objects. At some irrevocable moment, this person\u2019s identity changes in Machado\u2019s eyes from \u201cgirlfriend\u201d to \u201cabusive girlfriend,\u201d and part of the book\u2019s point is that the switch can happen way later than a rational person might expect. The quality of the writing is \u2014 uh, I read it with my tongue rolling out of my mouth like a red carpet, cartoon style. There are flourishes. There are footnotes. There are chapters that are one sentence long. It\u2019s like your inner monologue while watching Al Pacino in The Devil\u2019s Advocate: \u201cHa! Well this is really a performance \u2014 kinda nuts \u2014 can\u2019t believe he\u2019s getting away with it \u2014 wtf \u2014 no one else could do this.\u201d (The Devil\u2019s Advocate is one of my favorite movies, in case anyone is unclear on the horsepower of this compliment.) If your initial reaction to a memoir of untrammeled genre play is \u201cNot for me!,\u201d I encourage you to dip a toe anyway. Unlike the teenage Machado and her pastor, the formal gyrations of the book are not remotely confused and therefore not remotely confusing. It coalesces in real time into a moving, funny, violent portrait of a complicated person in a complicated relationship. She writes the way I wish I were capable of feeling!

By this formula, Ben Lerner\u2019s new novel is \u201creally about\u201d toxic masculinity, but that\u2019s just one blossom in a whole bouquet of themes, including the intricacies of high-school debate, lonesomeness, fame, violence, mental illness, the Westboro Baptist Church, migraines, and the Midwest. At the center is Adam, a teenager who is peculiarly aware, fairly miserable, and committed to a weird haircut. Like a lot of precocious youths, he\u2019s less in command of his intelligence than at the mercy of it. Jane and Jonathan Gordon are his parents. One is a feminist author, the other a shrink who specializes in drawing out reticent boys and men. Lerner looks at social literacy as a language available in various amounts to various people \u2014 some of the book\u2019s characters lack a strategy of language, some master it to silly or malignant purposes. When I imagine the genesis of the novel, I picture his taking a mental snapshot of any contemporary newspaper and adding to his to-do list \u201cWrite abt how we got here.\u201d The book is almost preposterously courageous, and it succeeds.

French Exit is about a rich widow who uses \u201cbreakfast\u201d as a verb and keeps her adult son on an upsettingly short leash. (They live together and speak on the phone from their respective \u2014 and thank God for that \u2014 beds.) After the widow liquidates her fortune on hotel suites and vacation properties, she moves to Paris with the overattached son and disaster ensues. French disaster! This fits into the category of books you experience with great impatience because you\u2019re simultaneously reading for pleasure and to get it over with so you can lend it to a specific person and find out what they think.
