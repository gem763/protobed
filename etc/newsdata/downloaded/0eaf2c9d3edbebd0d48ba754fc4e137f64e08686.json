That voice, which Lum \u2013 who goes by the name of her outlandish rap alter ego Awkwafina, a moniker inspired by her general awkwardness \u2013 has said makes her sound like a \u201c58-year-old divorce attorney\u201d or \u201cSatan\u201d, is now her calling card.\n\nIt is the connective tissue that runs through her decidedly scattershot career. You can hear it on the 30-year-old\u2019s comedy-rap records, in her stint as a talkshow host, during her winningly bonkers turn in Crazy Rich Asians and her poignant performance in this summer\u2019s US box-office hit The Farewell. Soon, it will be reaching millions more ears thanks to her lead roles in blockbuster Disney property (Raya and the Last Dragon and the live-action The Little Mermaid, if you believe the rumours), the new SpongeBob SquarePants movie, and her autobiographical, eponymous Comedy Central sitcom.\n\nIn a nutshell, Lum is \u201cjust your average Asian trumpet player-turned-rapper-turned-actress\u201d \u2013 as she drolly put it during her Saturday Night Live opening monologue last year. And that\u2019s her underplaying the complexity of her trajectory. After an adolescent infatuation with the brass instrument, in 2012 she became a comedy-rap star, winning YouTube fame with her genitalia-based trash-talk track My Vag. She parlayed that profile boost into regular appearances on MTV\u2019s comedy commentary show Girl Code and then \u2013 suddenly \u2013 a series of scene-stealing roles in Hollywood movies including Ocean\u2019s Eight and Crazy Rich Asians. Now, she has recast herself once again with an understated and subtly devastating starring role in The Farewell, in which she plays Billi, a disaffected millennial grappling with cultural identity and familial bonds while visiting her dying grandmother in China.\n\nDown the line from LA, where she has been fulfilling contractual obligations at Disney fan expo D23, Lum denies this latest left-turn into drama was deliberate. Rather, the plot of the film resonated strongly with her. The Farewell centres on Billi\u2019s touching relationship with her grandma; in real life Lum\u2019s is even closer. When she was four her mother died, and so she was raised by her Chinese paternal grandmother. But she wasn\u2019t just a guardian: she was an inspiration, a \u201cmatriarch\u201d and \u201cthe support system for so many of us. She worked three jobs and taught me that sex has no part in what your worth is.\u201d\n\nYet The Farewell isn\u2019t only concerned with intergenerational ties; it is also a fish-out-of-water drama that sees Billi reckoning with her Chinese heritage. Like Crazy Rich Asians, it features a visit to China by an Asian-American protagonist who finds the world they are faced with at once familiar and deeply strange. In her 20s, Lum went on a similar journey. Having \u201cspent a good part of my childhood not having a strong identity in terms of that world\u201d, she decided to move to China to study the language. But rather than finding herself, the experience left her even more lost.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Honour among thieves...

Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros\n\n\u201cI was growing up my whole life with people telling me to go back to this place, on the street or whatever,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you go back and you genuinely feel like you don\u2019t belong there \u2013 you don\u2019t speak the language and you were never taught it, you feel like a failure in that way. It\u2019s ironic.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a self-identified sense of disconnection she felt either; there was tangible hostility. \u201cI went with a friend who wasn\u2019t Asian but she spoke really good Mandarin, so she would communicate for the both of us and they would get really offended \u2013 like: \u2018Why isn\u2019t she talking to us?\u2019\u201d Even there, she faced race-related prejudice. \u201cI remember I went for this job for native English speakers and because I was Asian they didn\u2019t let me do it because they wanted a non-Asian person.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, pop culture has started to translate the profoundly disorientating experience of second- and third-generation immigrants into comedy and drama with increasing sensitivity and warmth. Yet during her childhood Lum says the depiction of people of Asian descent in film and TV mostly worked to embolden racists. \u201cThe way that media portrays people is the way that they are then treated in real life,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnything I grew up being taunted with \u2013 the accent, the \u2018ching-chongs\u2019 \u2013 those are generated from characters or the way we are spoken about in standup comedy.\u201d Lum, however, saw glimmers of hope. \u201cI latched on to strong Asian-American idols \u2013 Margaret Cho, Lucy Liu \u2013 that represented us as truly authentic beings.\u201d She pauses. \u201cMaybe not authentic, but just ourselves.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Money trouble...

Lum is only the second Asian-American woman to host Saturday Night Live \u2013 Liu was the first \u2013 and in her monologue she recalled how as a child she waited outside the show\u2019s studios in the hope of glimpsing her. \u201cAfter SNL, my dad was laughing about when I literally dragged him with me, because he took me on the subway to go,\u201d Lum scoffs. \u201cHe was like: \u2018Yeah, you were very annoying back then.\u2019 I was obsessed with Lucy Liu, especially after Charlie\u2019s Angels; that movie changed my life.\u201d\n\nFangirling was an activity that took up much of Lum\u2019s adolescence. Beyond Liu, she was \u201cobsessed with Rent and Thoroughly Modern Millie and random shows on Broadway\u201d, and would wait outside theatres for the cast to emerge. She was also a hip-hop fan, particularly De La Soul and People Under the Stairs. Having won a place at renowned performing arts school LaGuardia (alumni include Kelis and Nicki Minaj) off the back of her self-taught trumpet-playing, she began producing beats, adding raps that echoed her comic sensibility \u2013 something she connects to the early loss of her mother. \u201cIt was a visceral response to not wanting to be the reason that made people cry; I would rather make them laugh,\u201d she says, also citing an \u201cability to look around my world and realise the darkness but also the light\u201d.\n\nThe Farewell review \u2013 Awkwafina cements star status in family drama Read more\n\nSince the success of My Vag, Lum has made a series of comedy-rap records, but her segue into acting \u2013 now her main job \u2013 seems genuinely accidental. Her \u201cfirst time even thinking about [acting]\u201d was when Seth Rogen asked her to audition for Bad Neighbours 2 after seeing her on YouTube. Soon after, she was cast in a film called Dude, written and directed by Olivia Milch, who then went on to write all-female crime caper Ocean\u2019s Eight. That movie was to be Lum\u2019s third ever film role. So did she learn to act on set in front of luminaries such as Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock and Anne Hathaway? Not exactly, says Lum, who vaguely contests the idea that she was actually acting in those projects. Milch, she says, \u201cwrote close to my voice, so I think there was something to be said for almost playing yourself\u201d. Even more high-profile roles saw her continue to riff on her own personality. \u201cMy grandma watched Crazy Rich Asians and was like: \u2018So what? You\u2019re not even doing anything!\u2019\u201d she laughs.\n\nThere is certainly an effortlessness to Lum\u2019s performance in The Farewell, but you couldn\u2019t claim she\u2019s still muddling through under the guise of her own comic persona. Awkwafina\u2019s rise may have been defined by a scattershot, amusingly hustle-based success but, between the breathless plaudits for her most recent role and the ballooning number of big-money movies she\u2019s landing, it\u2019s clear that the career of Nora Lum is about to get serious, in more ways than one.\n\nThe Farewell is in cinemas on 20 September", "description": "Nora Lum is the comic-turned-star of The Farewell.
