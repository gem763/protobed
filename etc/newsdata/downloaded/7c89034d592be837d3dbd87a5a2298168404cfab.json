Greene will start as executive vice president and chief financial officer on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Greene succeeds R. Mark Graf, who will remain with the company as an executive adviser until his retirement early next year. Mr. Graf announced his retirement in June.\n\nMr. Greene was previously financial chief of drugmaker Bioverativ Inc., which was acquired by Sanofi last year.\n\nUnder Mr. Graf, Discover posted strong financial results and a solid balance sheet as it diversified revenue streams in recent years.\n\nOne area of focus for the new CFO, analysts said, will likely be the payments business, which Chief Executive Roger Hochschild has discussed on earnings calls.\n\n\u201cThe new CFO could help grow the payment business as a greater percentage of earnings, potentially through an acquisition,\u201d said Don Fandetti, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co. Mr. Greene handled several mergers and acquisitions as CFO of Willis Group Holdings PLC, where he worked before his stint at Bioverativ.\n\n\u201cThe problem in payments is that everything is very expensive,\u201d Mr. Fandetti said. \u201cBut a CFO might think, \u2018The more payments income, the better.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Greene also needs to maintain the strong investor outreach for which his predecessor was known, analysts said.\n\n\u201cMark made very complex topics easy to understand and made it seem to investors that all was going according to the long-term plan, which is not easy for a complex company,\u201d said Vincent Caintic, an analyst at Stephens Inc. who follows the company.\n\nMr. Greene will receive an annual base salary of $700,000, as well as $1 million in restricted stock units, Discover said in a regulatory filing.\n\nA Discover spokesman declined to comment beyond the public disclosures.\n\nDiscover\u2019s shares rose 0.6% to $85 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. News of the CFO appointment was released before regular trading.\n\n\u2014Chris Wack contributed to this article\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "Discover Financial Services has turned to a pharmaceutical executive to take over for its retiring finance chief who helped guide the company through a period of solid growth.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107038/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
