Also, he didn't think they would win.\n\nHe said he borrowed a blazer from the costume department and had someone from make-up \"hide the huge bags under my eyes because we haven't slept in a month\" \u2014 and arrived 10 minutes before it was announced the series had won.\n\nLengyel said after accepting the award, he went backstage and cried.\n\n\"At the same time that I'm standing up here on this podium, there's 50 people working for peanuts busting their arse trying to make this content to make people laugh and entertain them,\" he said.\n\n\"No one there is doing it to get rich.\"\n\nLengyel said he's had to rely on crowdfunding to produce digital shows.\n\n\"The way I describe it is that I'm the only person stupid enough to try and make a career out of this,\" he said.\n\nOthers in the industry have noticed his knack for raising funds and have approached him for help.\n\nAn Indiegogo campaign he managed raised $3.2 million for Stephen and Robbie Amell's sci-fi movie Code 8, a sum that Lengyel believes is a record for a Canadian film.\n\nHe also managed a Kickstarter campaign for Corner Gas: The Movie.\n\nInto the director's chair\n\nWith his latest project, Deep Six, Lengyel assumed the role of director.\n\nMika Collins, who co-created, co-wrote and co-produced Deep Six with Lengyel, says a director they had lined up became unavailable after the production schedule got pushed back.\n\n\"So we were working under a really tight deadline to get it done,\" said Collins, who also acts in the production. \"And so Davin was the next person available to do it and so he just went for it.\"\n\nActor Ginger Busch receives direction from Lengyel on the set of Deep Six. (Kim Sakamoto/Deep Six)\n\nCollins said Lengyel's approach was \"really collaborative\" with his crew and cast.\n\n\"These cast members were way more seasoned and experienced than he was and he was really drawing on their knowledge and their ideas,\" she said.\n\n\"And I think that created a really great environment because they felt really respected and that their voices mattered.\"\n\nLow-budget experiment\n\nThe series has won awards at some smaller film festivals, but Collins said she was encouraged by the feedback of people in the industry who appreciate how much shows cost to produce.\n\nCollins said a single episode of a television sci-fi series will usually cost millions, but they managed to produce an hour's worth of content, in six 10-minute episodes, with a budget of about $400,000.\n\nWith that money, they managed to build their own set, build a spaceship, create special effects, use original music and costumes and bring in experienced cast members known for other work.\n\nCollins, far left, and Lengyel discuss a scene while shooting a scene for Deep Six. (Jeff Auricchio/Deep Six)\n\n\"Our experiment was, 'How far can we make this tiny budget go?'\" she said. \"And I think a lot of people thought we went really far with it.\"\n\nLengyel has recently landed a role producing a handful of web series for Toronto-based television production company Shaftesbury Films, which produces Murdoch Mysteries for CBC and other networks.\n\n\"There is an actual opportunity to make a career and to be a professional in this field,\" he said. \"And I'm counting my lucky stars because I think I'm one of the few that's actually landed in one of those spots.\"", "description": "What began as a hobby shooting \"goofy videos\" has turned into a career for Davin Trent Lengyel of producing, writing and directing sci-fi web series.", "authors": ["Kelly Provost Is A Newsreader", "Reporter With Cbc News In Saskatoon.
