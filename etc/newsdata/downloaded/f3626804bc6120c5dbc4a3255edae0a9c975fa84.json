My father laid for 10 days on life support at a local hospital, but he never recovered consciousness.\n\nMy father\u2019s death was the most devastating time of my life. In that moment, I wondered how I\u2019d survive. I doubted my ability to overcome the trial.\n\nPAUL BATURA: I WAS SHOCKED \u2014 LITERALLY, WITH ELECTRICITY \u2014 AND LEARNED THIS INCREDIBLE LESSON\n\nI even doubted God\u2019s presence and care.\n\nI remember going to the hospital\u2019s chapel late in the evening the day my father died and asking God, \u201cWhy, Father, why did this happen?\u201d\n\nOver the years, I have learned that if there\u2019s one promise of Jesus that\u2019s easy to believe, it\u2019s this one: \u201cIn the world you will have tribulation.\u201d (John 16:33)\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs much as we\u2019d like it, believers don\u2019t get a pass from pain. We\u2019re not immune to the suffering and heartache that many people experience in the world. And when tough trials come upon us, it can suddenly seem much harder to take God at his word.\n\nBut whatever you\u2019re facing today, I want you to know what I learned that night while I prayed in the hospital\u2019s chapel: God is always holding out his hand to rescue you, even while the storm is raging.\n\nThe apostle Peter learned this lesson the night Jesus invited him to walk on water.\n\nYou might remember the story \u2014 Jesus\u2019 disciples were on a boat in the middle of a lake while Jesus had gone up to a mountain to pray, when all of a sudden, they saw a man walking toward them over the waves. At first, the disciples thought he was a ghost and were terrified. But then Jesus called to them, reassuring them it was he who was walking toward them.\n\nWill you take your eyes off Jesus and sink, or will you allow God\u2019s presence and power to steady you in the storm?\n\nYet Peter, being the brazen one of the crew, wanted more proof. He wanted to walk on the water with Jesus. This is what the Gospel of Matthew says happened next:\n\n\u201cLord, if it\u2019s you,\u201d Peter replied, \u201ctell me to come to you on the water.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d he said.\n\nThen Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \u201cLord, save me!\u201d\n\nImmediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \u201cYou of little faith,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy did you doubt?\u201d (Matthew 14:28-31)\n\nPeter did fine as long as he had his gaze fixed on Jesus. But as soon as he turned his attention to the wind and waves surrounding him, he began to sink.\n\nYour circumstances may be different from mine and different from Peter\u2019s. But you face the same choice: Will you take your eyes off Jesus and sink, or will you allow God\u2019s presence and power to steady you in the storm?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat night at the hospital\u2019s chapel, I sensed God\u2019s presence like few other times in my life. Despite all the pain and the loss of my father, I knew God was with me then and would be with me throughout it all.\n\nMy prayer for you is that when trials hit, you\u2019ll look up and lean hard into the arms of our loving Father, knowing he is faithful. He will hold you close \u2014 even through the darkest storm.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JACK GRAHAM", "description": "My prayer for you is that when trials hit, you\u2019ll look up and lean hard into the arms of our loving Father, knowing he is faithful.", "authors": ["Jack Graham", "Jack Graham Is The Pastor Of Prestonwood Baptist Church", "The Host Of Powerpoint Ministries."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/26/694940094001_6089718776001_6089716058001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
