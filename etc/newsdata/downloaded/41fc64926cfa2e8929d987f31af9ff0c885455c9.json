That charge carries up to one year in prison, but she could get probation as a first-time offender.\n\nRichardson faced life in prison if she had been convicted on all charges.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nProsecutors contended that Richardson wanted to keep her \u201cperfect life\" and attempted to do so by hiding her unwanted pregnancy and then buried her baby in her family\u2019s backyard in May 2017, within days of her senior prom. The remains were found that July in Carlisle, a village about 40 miles north of Cincinnati.\n\nRichardson's defense team said the baby she named \u201cAnnabelle\u201d was stillborn and that the teen was sad and scared.\n\nProsecutors said the circumstantial evidence pointed to murder, saying that Richardson had cleaned up a bloody mess and texted her mother that she was \u201chappy\u201d about her belly shrinking after the baby was gone.\n\nA forensic pathologist testified for the prosecution that she concluded the baby died from \"homicidal violence.\" Prosecutors said Richardson had searched on the internet for \"how to get rid of a baby.\" They played video for the jury of a police interview in which Richardson said the baby might have moved and made noises.\n\nCincinnati psychologist Stuart Bassman said \"Skylar was being manipulated\" into making false statements during interrogations. He described Richardson as a vulnerable, immature person whose dependent personality disorder makes her want to please authority figures, even to the point of making incriminating statements that were untrue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJulie Kraft, an assistant prosecutor, suggested that besides wanting to please authorities, Richardson's desire to please her family and boyfriend and fear of them abandoning her could have motivated her to commit extreme acts.\n\nThe trial drew daily coverage from Court TV and at least two national TV network newsmagazines planned stories on it.\n\nThe case had divided people in her village of some 5,000 people, with Facebook pages devoted to it and some critics trying to record the Richardson family's comings and goings to post on social media.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A young Ohio mother was acquitted Thursday\u00a0of charges that she killed her unwanted newborn.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
