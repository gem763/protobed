It\u2019s tempting to leave the likes of Hold My Breath Until I Die and Don\u2019t Believe the Things They Tell You (They Lie) as song titles alone, imagining the contents to fit your own heady nostalgia trip. But if you do decide to dive in, you\u2019ll discover plenty more painfully perfect evocations of adolescent angst inside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tegan and Sara Hey, I\u2019m Just Like You album art work\n\n\n\nTegan and Sara: \u2018People never talk about women and drug use positively\u2019 Read more\n\nHey, I\u2019m Just Like You is not merely an exercise in remembrance, however. In a pleasingly poetic act of artistic time travel, the 39-year-old Quin twins actually co-created the album with their teenage selves. The 12 tracks included here are tweaked versions of songs they wrote between the ages of 15 and 17, discovered on cassette while excavating material for their new memoir, High School. Perhaps because of the tinkering, the record doesn\u2019t quite have the mortifying novelty value of actual juvenilia, and those familiar with Tegan and Sara\u2019s artistic trajectory might detect a whiff of anachronism about the way these songs have been realised. The duo started life as an indie-rock outfit, pivoting to pop in the early 2010s with their album Heartthrob \u2013 Hey, I\u2019m Just Like You feels of a piece with their more recent work. Although there are traces of the sisters\u2019 early infatuation with bands such as Green Day (especially on the chugging I\u2019ll Be Back Someday), the defining sound is slick, pulsing and often pretty saccharine.\n\nThere are some pleasing interludes, particularly the doomy drop on Don\u2019t Believe the Things They Tell You (They Lie), but it\u2019s not always a style that proves hugely diverting, being a sort of beta-pop that falls into the cracks between instantly memorable, innovative and entertainingly extravagant. Certainly, Hey, I\u2019m Just Like You has a cracking backstory, but the album\u2019s workaday synthpop means it struggles to make much of an impact based purely on its sonic appeal.", "description": "(Warner Records)Reworked songs of teenage travails from the Quin twins, who go back to their youth in slick, pulsating pop", "authors": ["Rachel Aroesti"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe6528407c5d355461768c14530cd8bcf8b94d45/0_210_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fbc8cca0b2dc7f43fbe09b41ba329c75", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
