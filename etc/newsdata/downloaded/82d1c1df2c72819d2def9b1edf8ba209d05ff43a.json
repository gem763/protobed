The North Pole Igloos is slated to welcome its first guests in 2020 and will operate every April.\n\nThe experience is the brainchild of Janne Honkanen, founder and chief executive of Luxury Action, a high-end travel company specializing in arctic excursions. Honkanen said guests at the company\u2019s luxury wilderness lodge in the Finnish Lapland region were increasingly interested in knowing more about nature in the Arctic, which prompted the creation of the North Pole experience.\n\n\u201cI thought that this is the time and the opportunity to give a chance for my guests to experience the North Pole with arctic explorers and scientists in a safe way,\u201d Honkanen wrote.\n\n[What is \u2018green travel,\u2019 anyway? A beginner\u2019s guide to eco-friendly vacation planning.]\n\nGuests at the North Pole Igloos will sleep in one of 10 heated glass-walled igloos, where they can gaze at the stars, and probably the northern lights, through glass ceilings. During the day, travelers will sightsee around a glacier, meet indigenous people who live in the polar regions and arctic scientists working nearby, and hopefully catch sightings of seals, polar bears, arctic birds and other wildlife, Honkanen said.\n\nTed Scambos, a senior research scientist with the Earth Science and Observation Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said travelers in April can expect \u201cdim and twilighty\u201d daylight hours in the North Pole, where the sun is very low in the sky and temperatures range from minus 20 to minus 40 degrees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for the fainthearted,\u201d Scambos said.\n\n\n\nA polar bear looks out over the North Pole. (Courtesy of Luxury Action)\n\nHe noted that the experience is limited to the month of April after the North Pole\u2019s most \u201chardcore\u201d weather but before the summer melt sets in. The three- to five-night excursion (depending on weather) begins in Svalbard, a group of Norwegian islands in the Arctic Ocean, and only one night is spent at the North Pole.\n\n\u201cIn April, it\u2019s really safe and nice to travel; [otherwise] we\u2019re speaking about extreme conditions,\u201d Honkanen told The Washington Post by phone from Finland. The complex conditions, remoteness and short window for viable travel make the pole \u201cthe most exclusive travel destination on the planet.\u201d\n\nHe compared the scenery from the North Pole\u2019s frozen ice floe in the middle of the Arctic as one most people only see from the sky: \u201cIt\u2019s like looking out an airplane window and floating on the clouds with the baby blue sky around you.\u201d\n\nThe package includes air travel from the Lapland region to the North Pole, a camp manager, arctic wilderness guide, chef services, security and even thermal clothing.\n\nHonkanen doesn\u2019t see the ambitious plan as just another creative way to help the ultrawealthy unburden themselves of 100 grand. With two decades in the business of creating experiences like a $110,000 Nordic-themed \u201carctic safari,\u201d he said he worries that \u201cnowadays, luxury travel sometimes loses meaning.\u201d He wants the travel to mean something.\n\nHis goal is to introduce travelers to the Arctic\u2019s rare ecosystem and get them to evaluate their own role in climate change \u2014 and hopefully, spread the message to others.\n\n\u201cI want to connect each guest with the local culture, the local people, surrounding nature and the wildlife,\u201d Honkanen said. \u201cBut I [also] want to spread the word of the situation that\u2019s happening in the Arctic. Since we live up north, we see and feel how it affects our environment.\u201d\n\nHe noted that climate change is already having an impact on the fragile arctic ecosystem by affecting the food chain, wildlife and groups like reindeer herders and arctic fishermen whose livelihoods rely on the relative stability of the local environment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried about the climate crisis on the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of climate change, we don\u2019t know how many trips we can do up there. The North Pole is a glacier.\u201d\n\nHe said previous clients who\u2019ve traveled with his company have kept in touch to report taking on new recycling habits, planting trees and finding ways to offset their carbon footprint created from habits like flying private.\n\n[With eco-friendly travel more popular than ever, approach green claims with skepticism]\n\nHonkanen said the North Pole excursion is sustainable and mindful of not hurting the arctic environment.\n\n\u201cWe have to think about the environment and nature and having a minimum footprint. Everything we bring out, we bring back with us,\u201d he said, even the glamorous glass igloos.\n\nScambos, the arctic researcher, said travel to the North Pole is hardly carbon neutral; from Finland, it\u2019s another plane ride and a helicopter ride to reach the site.\n\n\u201cUnless they do a lot of carbon offsetting, they just have to accept the fact that they have to spend some carbon to give people this experience,\u201d Scambos said. Still, it could be well worth it, he said.\n\n\u201cI think it would change peoples\u2019 minds on how hard we need to work to change how we interact with our planet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing to give people that exposure. The environmental impact is small compared to the impact of a changed mind.\u201d\n\nAccording to Scambos, the real limitation of this particular excursion is that it\u2019s too short.\n\n\u201cIn April, you\u2019re only going to see a small window of how arctic climate is evolving, how thin the Arctic Sea ice is. In the summer \u2014 that\u2019s when you\u2019d be faced with the stark reality that this ice can\u2019t survive [rising temperatures].\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of traveling during the fall\n\n\u2018Green\u2019 travel stunts by airlines can\u2019t erase the environmental impact of flying\n\nHow to pack like Marie Kondo", "description": "The North Pole Igloos are slated to welcome its first guests in 2020 and will operate yearly every April.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News", "September At Pm", "Kim Bellware Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
