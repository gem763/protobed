Two associates of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani were arrested Wednesday, and are expected to face pressure from prosecutors to disclose details about Giuliani\u2019s links with Ukrainian officials. Lawyers for the intelligence official who raised the alarm about Trump and Ukraine announced that \u201cmultiple whistleblowers\u201d have now come forward. And to top it all off, Trump lost a major court case Friday in his battle with Congress over keeping his financial records secret.\n\nRead: Former Ambassador to Ukraine Says Trump Pushed Her Out Over 'False Claims'\n\nNowhere was the hemorrhaging more apparent than at the State Department , where a brewing revolt among top diplomats delivered fresh information to the impeachment inquiry, which is focused on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nDiplomats take the Hill\n\nTrump\u2019s former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch blew a hole in Trump\u2019s stone wall Friday with bombshell testimony about her abrupt and unusual recall from Kyiv this spring.\n\nYovanovitch defied orders to stay home, delivered by Trump\u2019s State Department on Thursday night, and instead responded to a last-minute subpoena by House Democrats.\n\nAppearing on Capitol Hill, Yovanovitch told Congress she was ordered to return to Washington from Ukraine \u201con the next plane\u201d last April, following a campaign of \u201cfalse claims\u201d against her and attacks by Giuliani.\n\nShe suggested associates of Giuliani sought her removal in order to earn money through some kind of corrupt scheme.\n\nREAD: The State Department Is Deep in Trump's Ukraine Scandal. These Text Messages Are Just the Latest Proof\n\n\u201cI do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch might have meant Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Giuliani\u2019s clients and fixers in Ukraine, who were arrested Wednesday. The Soviet-born businessmen were charged by New York prosecutors with making illegal campaign donations to GOP causes in a scheme to win political influence in the U.S. \u2014 and get Yovanovitch removed.\n\nGordon Sondland\u2019s New Backbone\n\nJust as Yovanovitch arrived on Capitol Hill, another central figure in the Ukraine scandal announced he would also disregard the State Department and testify this coming Thursday.\n\nEU ambassador Gordon Sondland\u2019s lawyers took special note of his explicit defiance of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s orders.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the State Department\u2019s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u2019 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying,\u201d Sondland\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nSondland took part in a damning series of text messages with other high-level State Department officials discussing how to get Ukraine to formally announce investigations that could prove politically helpful to Trump.\n\nRead: The State Department Is Deep in Trump's Ukraine Scandal. These Text Messages Are Just the Latest Proof\n\nAnd there\u2019s another explosive name on the Congressional docket for this Monday: Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top advisor on Russia and Europe.\n\nHill plans to tell Congress that Giuliani and Sondland pursued a shadow policy on Ukraine, side-stepping the regular procedure for accessing Trump on Ukraine issues, NBC News reported Thursday evening.\n\nHill, a former Brookings scholar, spent most of the last three years at Trump\u2019s elbow before relinquishing many of her duties in July and stepping down in August. Her attorney, Lee Wolosky, didn\u2019t return requests for comment from VICE News.\n\nDemocrats will have plenty of questions for all these diplomats about the details Trump and Giuliani\u2019s outreach to Ukrainian leaders \u2014 including whose idea it really was to fire Yovanovitch, and why Trump felt such an urgent need to get rid of her.\n\n\u201cBaseless Conspiracy Theories\u201d\n\nOther State Department officials will now be forced to choose between following their colleagues down to Capitol Hill, and staying silent at the request of Pompeo, who has accused Democrats of trying to \u201cbully\u201d his diplomats.\n\nDems also want to interview Bill Taylor, who became the top American diplomat in Ukraine after Yovanovitch\u2019s departure and was also on that series of bombshell text messages with Sondland, CNN reported on Friday.\n\nAlso on their list: George Kent, the State Department\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs; and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, the State Department counselor who was on the line for Trump\u2019s infamous July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nTogether, those diplomats could help Democrats piece together the Trump team\u2019s attempts to press Ukraine to follow up on what Yovanovitch suggested Friday were little more than pipe-dreams sold to Trump\u2019s circle by crooked conspiracy-mongers in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOur efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen,\u201d Yovanovitch testified. \u201cSadly, someone was listening, and our nation is the worse off for that.\u201d\n\nCover: President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally at the Target Center, Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, in Minneapolis.
