A string of designers have gone so far as to vow to never dress First Lady Melania.\n\nHis poignant post was met with support and praise by industry fingers including Louis Vuitton\u2019s accessories creative director Camille Miceli, Out Magazine editor-in-chief Phillip Picardi, makeup artist James Kaliardos, Veronika Heilbrunner, former Elle UK editor-in-chief Anne-Marie Curtis.\n\nHis post was directed against the Trump administration's treatment of the gay community.\n\nHis attack comes just three days after Donald Trump toured the Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas, located about 40 miles south of Fort Worth, along with LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke\n\nIn the October 17 Louis Vuitton factory visit the president bumbled on the pronunciation of the label's name and cut the ribbon to officially open the warehouse\n\nGhesqui\u00e8re has made a name for himself in championing a diverse and inclusive environment at Louis Vuitton where he cast trans and queer models\n\nTrump pictured at the factory with Alexandre Arnault, Chief Executive of LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy), and Bernard Arnault, CEO of Louis Vuitton Michael Burke\n\nLouis Vuitton did not comment on his post.\n\nGrab Your Wallet, a group that calls on shoppers to boycott businesses, told their followers to boycott the designer label.\n\n'Creating jobs is not an excuse to ignore morally repugnant behaviour,' Shannon Coulter, one of the movement\u2019s founders said to Business of Fashion earlier this week. 'Businesses are willing to look the other way in order to work with the Trump administration, but it\u2019s a worrisome trend.'\n\nGhesqui\u00e8re has made a name for himself in championing a diverse and inclusive environment at Louis Vuitton where he cast trans and queer models.\n\n'Seeing so many gender fluid and queer models being represented and being able to just be themselves is really inspiring,' he said on his work.\n\nHe also often works with Teddy Quinlivan, one of the most prominent fashion models in the industry at the moment.
