Next year, the province expects to cut 764 jobs.\n\nToews said the cuts are necessary to reach a balanced budget in 2022-2023. The budget also accounts for a reduction in corporate income taxes in the province to eight per cent from 12 per cent over the next four years.\n\n\u201cWhen hard-working Albertans see their incomes shrink and struggle to make ends meet, they have to face their fiscal realities \u2014 and so do governments,\u201d the budget reads.\n\nHowever, Alberta is also forecasting a 30-per-cent jump in non-renewable resource revenues in order to move from an $8.7 billion deficit this year to a surplus in four years. The province expects to pull in an extra $1.4 billion in revenues from the oilsands and an increase of $615 million in other resource revenues between now and 2022-2023 \u2014 accounting for the expected $1.8-billion budget surplus that year.\n\nToews said the expectations of higher non-renewable resource revenues were based on a cautious outlook for oil and gas prices and new pipelines. \u201cThis is not a boom-time scenario. This is a very cautious revenue projection,\u201d he said.\n\nIf no new pipelines are built, the province expects its revenues will drop by $3 billion, an amount that demonstrates how the fate of the province\u2019s finances are tied to the success of TC Energy Corp.\u2019s Keystone XL pipeline to the U.S. Gulf Coast, Trans Mountain Corp.\u2019s pipeline expansion project to the West Coast and Enbridge Inc.\u2019s Line 3 replacement to the U.S. Midwest.\n\nAlberta endured a brutal recession that began in 2014 when global oil prices collapsed, and its recovery has been slowed by a lack of new pipelines, which has thwarted the growth of its main industry and resulted in continued job losses, including at Calgary-based Husky Energy Inc. this week.\n\nThis is not a boom-time scenario. This is a very cautious revenue projection Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews\n\nThe province is projecting its GDP will finally reach pre-recession levels of $396.6 billion in 2020, but its unemployment rate will not return to pre-recession levels until 2022-2023, when it will fall to 5.2 per cent. The province\u2019s unemployment rate is expected to average 6.7 per cent this year.\n\nThe downturn also resulted in a dramatic drop in non-renewable resource revenue with the province posting a string of deficits in recent years that will continue with an $8.7-billion deficit this year.\n\nThis year\u2019s deficit is partially inflated by a $1.5-billion expense incurred by selling off contracts the previous government under then-premier Rachel Notley had signed to ship 120,000 barrels of oil per day out of Alberta on railway cars.\n\n\u201cThis is something that is fundamentally important to the return that all Albertans get for our energy resources,\u201d Notley said in February when her government signed the three-year contracts to lease 4,000 rail cars from Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway.\n\nBut the provincial government is now saying those contracts will lose $1.8 billion and they want to sell them to the private sector. \u201cThe business case carried a number of risks and assumptions never adequately disclosed to Albertans,\u201d the budget said.\n\n(The railcar purchase) business case carried a number of risks and assumptions never adequately disclosed to Albertans Alberta 2019 budget\n\nThe railway cars cost $3.7 billion and the plan to purchase oil from companies in Alberta will cost $6.8 billion. Both costs would swamp the estimated $8.7 billion in revenues the province expected to make by selling the oil.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s if everything went very, very well,\u201d Toews said, adding that he believed the plan to buy oil, ship it out of the province and sell it abroad posed too much risk to the government and taxpayers.\n\nMajor oilsands producers such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and Cenovus Energy Inc. have signalled their interest in buying the rail capacity.\n\n\u201cWe will be negotiating hard,\u201d Toews said of the imminent deal to sell the crude-by-rail contracts. He also dismissed the suggestion that Alberta had weakened its negotiating position by disclosing how much of a loss it was willing to accept to sell the contracts.\n\n\u201cThere is a real possibility it comes in lower,\u201d Toews said of the $1.5 billion provision.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw today is Premier Kenney\u2019s plan to make you pay more and get less,\u201d NDP Leader Rachel Notley said.\n\nNDP House Speaker Deron Bilous commented that \u201cthat was a whopper\u201d after the budget was tabled in Legislature, adding the bill would be subject to much debate in the coming weeks.\n\nIndeed, affected public sector workers were already planning to protest the budget Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Alberta Union of Provincial Employees planned rallies in both Calgary and Edmonton on Thursday when the budget was released. \u201cWhen they say \u2018cut back,\u2019 we say \u2018fight back!\u201d the union said in social media posts.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Province's 'spending problem' in spotlight: Finance Minister to cut 2.8 per cent from operating expenses, 7.7 per cent from workforce", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/jasonedited.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
