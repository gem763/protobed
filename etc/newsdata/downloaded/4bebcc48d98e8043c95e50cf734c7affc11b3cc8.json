And so will national rail travel, unless we speak up and be heard.\"\n\nTo be sure, food will still be served aboard Amtrak trains, but it may look wildly different. The newly \"enhanced\" and \"flexible\" menu will instead offer ready-to-eat meals instead of freshly prepared eggs, steak, and so on. More details on the changes can be found on Amtrak's website.\n\nAnd while Amtrak's head of customer experience, Andrew Wilander, was quick to place blame for the changes on younger generations of travelers, specifically millennials, not everyone is buying his logic.\n\nAt an event in New York City last week, Amtrak's CEO, Richard Anderson, seemed to hint that more dining-car cuts could be on the way.\n\n\"We want to simplify the process,\" he said. \"On the single-overnight, long-distance trains, we have a mandate from Congress to take the loss on the food down, and we're going to keep driving that down. The simplest way to do that is to go to a single food car and then have choice for customers.\"\n\nEven novelist Neil Gaiman wasn't happy with the news.", "description": "On some routes east of the Mississippi, Amtrak will no longer its traditional white-linen dinner service as it moves to cut costs.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d89327b2e22af2b50678617-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
