But the Bonn exhibition casts the effort to get Britain to join the European communities as one supported by Germany against the resistance of \u201cthe more or less hysterical French\u201d, as the first postwar chancellor Konrad Adenauer put it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cartoon by Fritz Behrendt showing British prime minister Harold Wilson trying to climb \u2018Mount Gaulle\u2019. Photograph: House of History/Axel Th\u00fcnker\n\nA framed German cartoon from 1967 depicts the UK\u2019s journey into Europe as an arduous climb, with Adenauer and other European leaders pulling prime minister Harold Wilson up the steep face of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s upturned nose.\n\nGermany\u2019s Anglophilia is shown to be not only political. Seven themed rooms showcase a postwar infatuation with Britain\u2019s royal family, sport, fashion, music and sense of humour \u2013 on both sides of the iron curtain.\n\nPoster campaigns and a 1970 industrial fair in London bear witness to socialist East Germany\u2019s longing to achieve diplomatic recognition from the UK, all the while as its regime agitated against British cultural influence in public.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Skin of Ringo Starr\u2019s bass drum from the 1960s, when Germany fell in love with the Beatles and British culture.

But the exhibition shows that the Stones and the Beatles found fond imitators not just in Germany\u2019s west \u2013 where groups called the Lords or the Butlers suddenly spring up everywhere \u2013 but also in the east, where the band Music-Stromers wore uniform jackets reminiscent of those on the cover of Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\n\nIn secret, many East Germans wrote anonymous dispatches to the BBC, many of them emotional and heartbreaking, which are read out on its German-language service every Friday evening from the early 1950s.\n\nIn return, what did Germany get from Britain? Admiration for German manufacturing is visually represented here by John Hegarty\u2019s mould-breaking series of \u201cVorsprung durch Technik\u201d Audi ads. There are moving symbols of postwar reconciliation, such as the cross made of nails collected from the rubble of Coventry cathedral, gifted to the parish of St Nikolai in Kiel as early as 1947.\n\nCurator Christian Peters told the Guardian that the object he was most proud of obtaining on loan for the show was a liturgical robe depicting scenes from the destruction of Coventry and Dresden, worn by the Bishop of Coventry on Ash Wednesday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liturgical robe commemorating the common history of the blanket-bombed cities Dresden and Coventry.
