She had short gray hair. She was wearing black breeches (pants), a black military-style coat with a giant, fluffy, white neck piece, and a cool necklace. She was carrying a long stick. She worked for the Queen, she looked mad, and everyone had to listen to her \u2014 or else. Her name? Black Rod.\n\nThe whole chamber seemed to have been plunged into a fever dream: People yelled, sang songs in Welsh, and held up signs while Black Rod, carrying her stick, forced a man out of his chair and out of the room to go see the Queen. Is this just \u2026 how they do things in England? Yes, apparently it is. Here\u2019s some helpful information, in case you, too, watched the livestream and thought you were having some kind of episode:\n\nWhat the hell is happening in U.K. Parliament right now?\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson had decided to initiate \u201cprorogation\u201d of Parliament, which is a fancy word for suspending a session. His aim in doing so is to shut Parliament down for five weeks \u2014 a stark difference, the New York Times notes, from \u201cthe traditional period of several days.\u201d Critics say his goal is to stifle debate with the opposition over the impending October 31 Brexit deadline, when Britain will leave the European Union under circumstances called \u201cno-deal\u201d (which doesn\u2019t sound great, to be fair). Many, many MPs (members of Parliament) do not want this to occur, especially the ones who didn\u2019t vote for Brexit in the first place.\n\nJohnson announced his intention to initiate prorogation at the end of August, to huge uproar. By Monday night \u2014 the final vote of the parliamentary session \u2014 opposition MPs had handed Johnson a series of defeats, passing a law to prevent the passage of a no-deal Brexit, and rejecting his bid to hold snap elections. As the session drew to a close, Black Rod entered the House of Commons to start the proceedings, as is custom. What happened next was not.\n\nSorry to my UK followers, but why are your politics such a fucking LARP? Like the fucking QUEEN used her powers to suspend parliament and then some lady named BLACK ROD came in dressed like a fucking wizard drill sergeant to kick everyone out. What the fuck? pic.twitter.com/5vtmlqKp0i \u2014 Kikipoints (@0ddbagel) September 10, 2019\n\nWait, so who is Black Rod, and why is she so fancy?\n\nBlack Rod, dressed like a mix of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Prince, is basically the Queen\u2019s emissary in the House of Lords, Parliament\u2019s upper chamber. This Black Rod, Sarah Clarke, is actually the first female black rod ever, so she is the first Lady Usher of the Black Rod (as opposed to Gentleman Usher). Her job is to, among other duties, control access to the House of Lords and to initiate official ceremonial events like prorogation. Before this, she was in charge of running Wimbledon, and she loves details.\n\nSo how did the ceremonial event go last night?\n\nBlack Rod entered the House of Commons to compel Speaker John Bercow, who heads the chamber, to rise. (Under parliamentary procedure, Parliament cannot be suspended unless the Speaker is standing.) Per the New York Times, \u201cOpposition lawmakers threw themselves at the silk-canopied speaker\u2019s chair, trying in vain to keep him from getting to his feet and allowing Parliament to be suspended.\u201d Though Bercow did eventually get to his feet, he made his displeasure clear, proclaiming, \u201cThis is not a standard or normal prorogation.\u201d Additionally, when he was approached by a group of Conservative MPs trying to heckle him, he said, Britishly, \u201cI could not give a flying flamingo what your view is!\u201d With that, he sullenly followed Black Rod out the door.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers refused to follow, however, and chose to remain in the chamber, singing in protest and chanting, \u201cShame!\u201d They also held up handmade signs that read \u201cSilenced.\u201d\n\nJohn Bercow caves in and goes to the House of Lords with Black Rod.\n\n\n\nOpposition MPs chant \u201cshame on you\u201d at Conservative MPs.\n\n\n\nIt is like a The Parliament of a war torn country #Prorogation pic.twitter.com/M0knK4QSjC \u2014 Charlie Proctor (@MonarchyUK) September 10, 2019\n\nBercow the hero pic.twitter.com/LFkHGH5S9b \u2014 Stephen Morgan MP (@StephenMorganMP) September 10, 2019\n\nThe Welsh members also gave us a beautiful song. With harmony! \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc77\udb40\udc6c\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc7f pic.twitter.com/iXV8xeuDoX \u2014 Hannah Bardell \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@HannahB4LiviMP) September 10, 2019\n\nWhat does Black Rod think about all this?\n\nI don\u2019t know, because Black Rod\u2019s whole thing is about ceremony and order, but she seemed to look pretty annoyed with everyone making a fuss. I do know that I would watch a show called Black Rod instead of Black Mirror, about a woman who makes men get out of their seats with her stick.\n\nBlack Rod's face while Bercow was doing his speech... pic.twitter.com/nlhOMCjYbw \u2014 Alex Partridge \ud83d\udea1 (@alexpartridge87) September 10, 2019\n\nAnd what happens now?\n\nIn the House of Lords, the prorogation ceremony was officially completed. MPs won\u2019t return until mid-October, which gives them only a little more than two weeks before the Brexit deadline. If Johnson loses support in Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party could try and scramble to form an alternative government before the deadline \u2014 he could also try to get around them anyway and still pass a no-deal Brexit.
