I didn\u2019t even want to think about not being offered a contract.\n\nThat dream looked like it could become a reality when I made it to Southampton Football Club at 13 years old. They had produced some of my favourite football heroes and I was given the amazing opportunity to train with boys like myself, who wanted to be the next big thing in football.\n\nAll of this came to a halt when I was subjected to sexual abuse at the hands of a coach that I trusted and looked up to.\n\nBob Higgins was a well-respected football coach for Southampton FC who abused his position of power and subjected me to what I can only describe as pure hell for two and a half years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 90s, myself and five other boys who were also sexually abused by Higgins came forward to bring this man to justice \u2013 even though at that time child sexual abuse was not something that was spoken about.\n\nI was scared that people would think that a man as well-known as Higgins could never do such an abhorrent thing to any boy.\n\nWe lost our criminal case against him, and Higgins was able to go back to football coaching, and to continue his secret terror of sexual abuse against other children.\n\nHiggins took away years of my childhood, and ruined my adult life, without paying any consequences for it (Picture: Dean Radford)\n\nFinally, in June this year, Higgins was finally convicted of sexual abuse and jailed for 24 years for the abuse of 24 schoolboys over a 25 year period, from 1971 to 1996. But he wasn\u2019t convicted for sexually abusing me.\n\nThe system failed us back in the 90s, and the law is failing us again now.\n\nA loophole in the law called \u2018double jeopardy\u2019 means Higgins can\u2019t be retried in a criminal court for the same charge. People can only be retried for the same crime if there\u2019s new and compelling evidence and the crime is considered \u2018serious\u2019 or \u2018severe\u2019 enough.\n\nIt\u2019s disgusting that most forms of child sexual abuse aren\u2019t considered \u2018serious\u2019 or \u2018severe\u2019 enough for a retrial. This is why I\u2019m campaigning to change the out-of-date \u2018double jeopardy\u2019 law, so that other children don\u2019t have to go through the same thing we had to endure.\n\nAn 800-year-old law that doesn\u2019t deem child sexual abuse as a \u2018serious\u2019 enough offence is not a law that should have a place in our society\n\nI am also doing this for closure \u2013 for myself and the five other men who were brave enough to come forward with me in the 90s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though Higgins is in jail right now, he spends no time in his cell for the abuse he subjected us to. He sits in jail knowing he got away with it when it comes to us.\n\nHiggins stared at me during the trial in the 90s, trying to get me to react. He sometimes even laughed at me, knowing that he was still having an effect on my life.\n\nHe took away years of my childhood and ruined my adult life, without paying any consequences for it. There isn\u2019t one day that I don\u2019t feel sick to the stomach, or sleep through one night without waking up and thinking of what he did to me.\n\nAll I\u2019m asking for is an acknowledgment that the abuse took place.\n\nWhat Higgins did to us is something that can happen to any child, at any time. I want to do everything in my power to get this law changed and get justice.\n\nAn 800-year-old law that doesn\u2019t deem child sexual abuse as a \u2018serious\u2019 enough offence is not a law that should have a place in our society.\n\nWe need to do everything we can to get the government to listen. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve started a Change.org petition to prove to MPs and the government that people care about this issue. The more people that sign, the louder our voices will be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: The racism in Bulgaria could easily have taken place at a football match in England\n\nMORE: \u2018I was a completely broken man\u2019: A survivor of domestic abuse shares his story\n\nMORE: Football is where toxic masculinity thrives \u2013 the abuse I received during matches is testament to that", "description": "He was convicted for sexually abusing 24 other boys over a 25 year period - but my case against him has been dismissed.", "authors": ["Dean Radford"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dean2-fba0-e1571829865163_1571998601.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
