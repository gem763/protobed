The administration lodged similar requests in both courts after stating its intention to appeal Howell\u2019s ruling in court papers filed Monday.\n\nIn her 75-page decision, Howell rejected arguments that the House Democrats weren\u2019t entitled to invade grand jury secrecy because they weren\u2019t engaged in a proper judicial proceeding.\n\nDespite the appeals court order, Howell issued a ruling later on Tuesday denying the DOJ\u2019s request to put the release of the documents on hold until the appeal is resolved. She said the DOJ isn\u2019t likely to win an appeal and that both the House and the public have an interest in gaining immediate access to the grand jury material.\n\nThe appeals court decision to put the release of the documents on hold though still appears to remain in force. The DOJ and the House were told to file briefs on the issue of a long-term stay with the appeals court by Nov. 5.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Sept. 24 that her chamber would undertake an impeachment inquiry, after it received a whistle-blower complaint alleging that Trump had tied $391 million in Ukrainian aid already approved by Congress to that nation\u2019s willingness to investigate his presidential rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter for possible corruption in Ukraine. The inquiry is focused on Ukraine but will inevitably include events that Mueller, who stepped down in May, investigated in his 22-month probe.\n\nRecognizing the inquiry as a necessary precursor to full-blown proceedings, the judge wrote, \u201cImpeachment based on anything less than all relevant evidence would compromise the public\u2019s faith in the process.\u201d\n\nThe Judiciary Committee opposed the Justice Department\u2019s request for a stay pending resolution of the appeal, calling the grand jury papers \u201cessential to its urgent impeachment inquiry.\u201d But it told both the district and appeals courts it would consent to a seven-day \u201cadministrative stay\u201d allowing the court more time to consider the government\u2019s request for longer-term relief.\n\nThe district court case is In re: Application of the Committee on the Judiciary, 19-gj-48, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). The appellate case is In re: Application of the Committee on the Judiciary, 19-5288, U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit (Washington).\n\n(Updates with judge\u2019s ruling)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Andrew Harris in Washington at aharris16@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Jeffrey, Joe Schneider\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Congressional Democrats weighing President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment will have to wait to see a fuller version of Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and its accompanying grand jury materials.Trump administration lawyers won a postponement", "authors": ["Andrew Harris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lDgeLOxbE8sJRK_RzVnJGw--~B/aD0xMzcxO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/732dba5cac5824be151cc26f681c78d6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
