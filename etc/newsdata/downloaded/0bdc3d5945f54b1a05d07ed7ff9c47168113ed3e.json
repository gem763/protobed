To allow herself wiggle room | Art Cullen Read more\n\nThe poll, by Suffolk University and USA Today, released on Monday, suggested Buttigieg\u2019s attack on Warren\u2019s healthcare plans in last week\u2019s debate may have paid off, at least in the short term.\n\nAmong respondents in the Iowa poll, 40% said Buttigieg\u2019s debate performance had been stronger than they expected.\n\nThe 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a force in the ideological centre of the sprawling Democratic field, has also campaigned hard in Iowa, the first state to vote.\n\nThe new poll put Biden at 18%, Warren at 17% and Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in the race, at 13%.\n\n\u201cIowa is unquestionably up for grabs,\u201d David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center, told USA Today.\n\nThe mayor, he said, \u201chas found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders. All of this is happening while the number of undecided voters continues to grow as Democratic caucus-goers pause to re-evaluate the changing field.\u201d\n\nIn the poll, 29% of voters said they were still undecided.\n\nButtigieg appeared on the political talk shows on Sunday, commenting on the row between Hillary Clinton and campaign rival Tulsi Gabbard and, more directly, attacking Warren over her position on healthcare, a key point of contention.\n\nRevisiting an attack from his performance in last week\u2019s debate in Ohio, Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cWe need to see how [Medicare for All] is going to be paid for. Right now, whether you copy-paste the Bernie Sanders math or do it some other way, there is a hole amounting to trillions of dollars in how this is supposed to work.\u201d\n\nWarren said on Sunday she would soon release details of how she would pay for her version of Medicare for All.\n\nButtigieg discussed his idea, Medicare \u201cFor Those Who Want It\u201d. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, he agreed he would pay for it by \u201cjust basically roll[ing] back\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s \u201centire corporate tax cut\u201d.\n\nHe also conceded: \u201cGoverning is easier said than done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Warren, Sanders or Biden vs Trump \u2013 all the other Democrats are irrelevant | Robert Reich Read more\n\nAs the field narrows \u2013 slightly \u2013 and the 3 February Iowa caucuses draw near, Buttigieg has posted strong fundraising numbers. He raised $19.1m in the third quarter of the year, down from a second quarter which brought in $24.9m but still contributing to a healthy campaign war chest.\n\nIn a Guardian analysis of donations to the Democratic candidates, released on Monday, Buttigieg came out on top among business executives, military veterans (he served in Afghanistan) and \u2013 topically \u2013 doctors.\n\n\u201cPete continues to stand out as having the vision and leadership voters know we need to tackle the urgent problems facing our country,\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl, said when the third-quarter figures were released. \u201cIt also positions us solidly as one of the top three fundraisers in this race.\u201d\n\nSanders was in fourth place in the new Iowa poll, with 9%. Kamala Harris, who surged in the equivalent poll in June after a strong performance in thefirst debate of the campaign, fell to 3%.
