Government will repay this debt over the next three years to honour its contractual obligation.\"\n\nTreasury said operational changes were urgently needed at the struggling flagship carrier, and Mboweni did not mince his words in his budget address.\n\n\"We have essentially chosen to subsidise the middle class and wealthy flying around the country and other parts of the world, rather than the ordinary workers who sit in old trains from the townships every day, often getting stuck and being late for work,\" he said.\n\n\"We are also subsidising the wealthy bond holders, who hold government-guaranteed debt but receive higher yields without additional risk.\"\n\nThe minister also confirmed that the carrier is in discussions with potential equity partners to \"liberate the fiscus from this SAA sword of Damocles\", though he did not provide any further information.\n\nTreasury has already transferred R5.5bn to the airline in the current year \u2013 part of the R37bn support package to struggling state-owned entities. The funds were to enable the carrier to extend maturities on outstanding debt obligations and give it time to develop an affordable repayment plan with creditors, according to the policy document.\n\nSAA requires R21.7bn to support its turnaround plan, Fin24 previously reported. R5bn recapitalisation was approved for 2018/19, and a further R5.5bn approved for 2019/20.\n\n\n\nWithout a debt repayment plan supported by government, the airline's lenders are unlikely to extend more loans to SAA beyond the end of the fiscal year. \"If this happens, government is contractually required to step in and repay its debt.\"\n\nOver R28bn in cumulative losses\n\nTreasury's document notes that over the past 13 years, SAA's cumulative losses amounted to over R28bn.\n\nThe airline's financial position is so dire that it failed to finalise its financial statements for the 2018/19 year on time. Subsequently the auditor-general could not complete its audit assessment of the airline, Fin24 previously reported.\n\nPublic Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan told Parliament that the financial statements would be tabled as soon as the going concern challenges are resolved.\n\n\n\n", "description": "South African Airways is not generating sufficient cash flow to sustain its operations, nor can it repay outstanding debt.", "authors": ["- Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4833/d7ccdbdf9bc741f2a0ce1a231c92ff61.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
