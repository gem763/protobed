Clearly, you shouldn't own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else. pic.twitter.com/jsiZmwjMDs\n\nEarlier, Cain, a 34-year-old \u201cconservative Republican\u201d lawyer who represents a district outside of Houston, Texas, had mocked Twitter users who called his comment a threat of violence. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he told one commenter. When O\u2019Rourke called the tweet a death threat, and said it proved that neither Cain nor anyone else should own an AR-15, Cain responded, \u201cYou\u2019re a child, Robert Francis.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke endorsed a ban on the possession of certain military-style rifles shortly after the mass shooting last month in his home town of El Paso, Texas, in which 22 people died and dozens were injured. He has specifically called for a mandatory government buyback of AR-15s, following Australia\u2019s gun control model.\n\nBiden clashes with Warren and Sanders in lively Democratic debate Read more\n\nCain, who did not respond to an emailed request for comment, appeared to defend his tweet as simply a version of a popular slogan among American gun rights activists \u2013 \u201cCome and take it\u201d \u2013 which generically dares any politician to try to confiscate their guns.\n\nIn response to thousands of people responding with anger and concern that he was threatening violence against a presidential candidate, the millennial Republican wrote, \u201cI get ratioed in the reg\u201d, meaning that his tweets are regularly overwhelmed with a large ratio of disapproving comments.\n\nThe Twitter policy that Cain violated, according to a Twitter spokesperson, was the rule that \u201cYou may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people.\u201d\n\nThe rest of Cain\u2019s Twitter account, including his response calling O\u2019Rourke a child for labeling the tweet a \u201cdeath threat\u201d, remained online Thursday night.\n\nThe O\u2019Rourke campaign reported the tweet to the FBI, a campaign spokesperson told the Guardian. The campaign declined to offer any additional comment, including any response to Twitter\u2019s decision to take down Cain\u2019s original tweet.\n\nSpokespeople for the FBI\u2019s Houston bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday night.\n\nSome Twitter users noted that Robert Francis was also the name of Robert F. Kennedy, who was shot dead while running for the Democratic nomination for president in 1968.\n\n\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 (@BriscoeCain) You\u2019re a child Robert Francis https://t.co/rU3WoYQFQV\n\nIn 2018, Cain appeared to bring a gun to a Democratic convention in Forth Worth, Texas, as part of a disruptive prank in which he handed out gun control signs.", "description": "Twitter takes down Republican Briscoe Cain\u2019s tweet within hours because it violates rules on \u2018threats of violence\u2019", "authors": ["Lois Beckett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4db7c662877457dae1bfdbff4868e9e1ad00575/779_214_2459_1476/master/2459.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05c8ca0f19a7773622f68ba03972c3af", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
