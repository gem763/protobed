Any delay \u2014 and there are many \u2014 leads to a crush of people and a generally uncomfortable commute.\n\nSuch overcrowding is unlikely to abate anytime soon, but an office located directly above the station may hold the key to eventually addressing it. There, as would-be passengers below wait and possibly contemplate a move to a quieter city (say, Peterborough), a big screen records the number of devices that have logged on to the station\u2019s Wi-Fi network.\n\nThat data has value to BAI Communications Canada, which built and operates cellular and Wi-Fi networks across the Toronto Transit Commission\u2019s underground system of subway stations. In May, the TTC and BAI signed a $420,000 contract (plus a combined monthly operating fee of around $35,000) to provide overcrowding notifications and count passengers, services the transit agency said it expects to start in November and January, respectively.\n\nThe services are just part of what BAI hopes to eventually offer the TTC, its customers and, possibly, other Canadian transit agencies. The company\u2019s business plan includes helping serve ads to a captive commuting audience and providing cellular service to telecom customers, with the profits one day ending up in the pockets of retirees, since BAI is owned by Canadian pension funds.\n\n\u201cWe know where the devices are,\u201d said Ken Ranger, chief executive of BAI Communications Canada. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s a bunch of things that you can do with that.\u201d\n\nBut BAI\u2019s business plan involves collecting information about people at a time when they are becoming extremely sensitive about how their data is used. For instance, plans by a Google LLC sister company for a smart-city development on Toronto\u2019s waterfront have run into staunch opposition over privacy concerns.\n\nDocuments obtained by the Financial Post following a freedom-of-information request suggest that the $420,000 contract calls for BAI to use its existing Wi-Fi data \u201cto estimate passenger flow, in and out of all subway stations.\u201d\n\nThere is a \u201cstrong correlation between Wi-Fi device counts and passenger counts at subway stations,\u201d a TTC presentation dated February 2019 states. Algorithms could use the Wi-Fi data to help estimate passenger volume, it suggests, while real-time overcrowding notifications could be provided \u201cthrough (a) Web Portal, email, SMS message, etc.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a service BAI would like to provide to all commuters has led to a public confrontation with Canada\u2019s biggest telecommunications companies: BCE Inc., Rogers Communications Inc. and Telus Corp.\n\nThe Big Three own 90 per cent or so of the mobile market, but they have declined to pay BAI for the privilege of allowing their customers to send text messages and make phone calls via BAI\u2019s underground network. Only Shaw Communications Inc.-owned Freedom Mobile has agreed to terms with BAI at this point.\n\nAt an impasse, BAI in September launched a campaign to highlight the Big Three\u2019s reticence.\n\n\u201cCellular service is available\u2026 Let the Big Three know you want access,\u201d reads a login page when commuters connect to the subway Wi-Fi. The page includes a link to a petition commuters can sign. Similar ads have also appeared inside subway cars.\n\nSo far, the telecoms have not come to the table, Ranger said, even though the number of petition signings has exceeded their expectations.\n\n\u201cOur surveys that we have conducted show people overwhelmingly want cellular service within the system,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, a similar amount of people aren\u2019t aware that there\u2019s actually facilities in the subway that can provide service to all licensed carriers in Toronto.\u201d\n\nAlthough deals with the Canadian telecoms have proven elusive, elsewhere, they have not.\n\nBAI Communications Canada belongs to Sydney, Australia-based BAI Communications Pty Ltd., the subsidiaries of which have also installed a communications system for Hong Kong\u2019s public-transit system, provided wireless connections for New York subway riders and own and operate a network in Australia that transmits national television and radio broadcasts.\n\nIn New York, cell service is provided for the customers of AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp., T-Mobile US Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. by Transit Wireless, a company in which BAI is the majority shareholder.\n\nPeople overwhelmingly want cellular service within the system Ken Ranger\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that, certainly, when I talk to my neighbours, they don\u2019t understand,\u201d Ranger said of the Toronto impasse. \u201cWe\u2019re an infrastructure provider. We built a highway that anyone could put their proverbial cars on to get to their customers.\u201d\n\nBut some telecoms have suggested Toronto should be more like Montreal, where Bell, Rogers, Telus and Vid\u00e9otron Lt\u00e9e all chipped in to build the network.\n\n\u201cCanadian wireless providers including Bell look forward to building out the wireless infrastructure required to serve customers on the Toronto subway system, but have been denied access to do so,\u201d said Bell spokesperson Nathan Gibson in an email.\n\nRanger disagrees that access has been denied.\n\n\u201cOur statement would be, \u2018Well, if you can work with your competitors, please work with someone who isn\u2019t your competitor,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIn the meantime, BAI is looking for more ways to provide money-making services with its network, which Ranger said was \u201cpurpose built\u201d to accommodate future technological changes, such as the shift to 5G cellular networks.\n\nBAI has laid down more than 75 kilometres of fibre-optic cable and installed about 1,000 boxes throughout Toronto\u2019s subway system that can be popped open and filled with whatever tech is required.\n\nThe TTC said BAI provides public and employee Wi-Fi networks, a hard-wire connection to a TTC data centre from a TTC-leased building, and cell service for Freedom customers at underground stations, the downtown tunnels and in the subway extension to Vaughan. Ranger said BAI\u2019s network also supports the electronic fare payment system known as Presto.\n\nNot even halfway through its contract, BAI Canada has spent around $50 million on building the wireless network, including subcontracting construction and tunnelling, but is seeing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, according to its chief executive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re cash-flow positive,\u201d said Ranger, without giving specific numbers.\n\nSome of the earnings are destined to wind up in the pockets of Canadian retirees. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board owns the majority of BAI, and Ranger said its other shareholders are the Alberta Investment Management Corp. and a number of provincial funds managed by InstarAGF Asset Management Inc.\n\nCanada\u2019s flagship pension fund taking a stake in the company providing subway Wi-Fi makes sense given the need for public-private partnership on technology projects.\n\nSuch partnerships are not that unusual anymore, said Matti Siemiatycki, interim director of the University of Toronto\u2019s School of Cities, and the rise of all things digital has municipal governments turning to businesses for help in that particular area.\n\n\u201cThe reason (for such arrangements) in many ways is governments don\u2019t always have the expertise to provide those services, or they\u2019re not core services,\u201d Siemiatycki said. \u201cAnd, in some cases, if they have a revenue stream, the government can find a way to provide the service without having to fund it themselves.\u201d\n\nIf the Big Three telcos were hoping to change the TTC\u2019s model, they might be out of luck given that the transit agency seems willing to deepen its partnership with BAI, which began in 2012 when BAI agreed to pay $25 million for the right to install and operate a wireless network in the city\u2019s subway system.\n\nThe TTC\u2019s 2018-2022 ridership growth strategy states that the agency, along with its provincial counterpart Metrolinx and BAI, would \u201cLeverage Presto, mobile and Automatic Passenger Counter (APC) data to analyze trends and gain customer insights.\u201d\n\nA TTC spokesperson said that program has started with Presto and APC data.\n\nRanger said BAI is working with the TTC on a number of pilot projects to harness the company\u2019s hardware.\n\nBAI\u2019s interest in Canada is not limited to Toronto, either. Ranger said it has had \u201clots\u201d of talks with transit agencies in Western Canada and Quebec, and suggested BAI\u2019s technology could be applied to other sorts of transit hubs, such as airports.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re very focused on our investment here in the Toronto subway,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that we wouldn\u2019t be keen on investing in the right conditions in any other market, and particularly globally.\u201d\n\nYet inviting more private-sector participation in public transit could increase political pushback. News about Ontario\u2019s Progressive Conservative government weighing the sale of naming rights for GO Transit stations, as well as ridership data, prompted outrage from the opposition, which called on the province\u2019s privacy commissioner to intervene.\n\nOntario\u2019s information and privacy commissioner also recently recommended the provincial government review and modernize existing laws \u201cto address the risks inherent\u201d in smart-city technologies.\n\n\u201cWhile (the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act) provides a foundation for privacy protections, it is outdated in the face of current digital technologies and practices such as sensors, big data analytics and artificial intelligence,\u201d the commissioner\u2019s annual report said.\n\nThe privacy policy for BAI\u2019s TCONNECT Wi-Fi network states it collects information about riders\u2019 devices and the services they use, and that BAI and its affiliates may use cookies or record media access controller (MAC) addresses, which are unique numbers that can identify devices on a network.\n\nBAI takes steps to anonymize information it collects, and is not interested in individual behaviour, just the aggregate information and how devices are moving around its network, Ranger said. The company also consults with various experts and has a global privacy committee.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a societal issue that we take incredibly serious,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t look to just comply with the local legislation and check a box; we want to know what the best practices are globally.\u201d\n\nSome of BAI\u2019s cash flows come from advertising, which Ranger said help allow them to offer the free Wi-Fi. For example, earlier this year, commuters logging onto the subway Wi-Fi were guided to a page with a big ad for eBay Inc. In September, ads for the Toronto Public Library popped up on the log-in page, a partnership the library said came at no cost to it.\n\nBut without ad dollars, \u201cthe TTC would have to reflect that in their fare box or in a subsidy,\u201d Ranger said.\n\nAdvertisers are not given access to the data BAI may collect, he said, though that assurance might not appease everyone.\n\n\u201cI think TTC riders are happy to be getting a Wi-Fi service that is at no cost to them,\u201d Ranger added. \u201cAnd I think that people understand that advertising-supported means that somebody \u2026 is trying to get something out of it. What we\u2019re trying to get out of it is just an advertiser to know where the person is and get their message delivered to them.\u201d\n\nAt the very least, Toronto subway riders have an internet connection to entertain them as they suffer through yet another delay.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "BAI collecting data to serve ads, send notifications and count passengers and wants to offer cell service to everyone, if only Big Three would play ball", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ttc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
