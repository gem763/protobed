Tomato season was in full bloom at the farmers market \u2014 and also on my face, thanks to a tomatoey zit with a gestation period so long it should\u2019ve been considered an heirloom. Unlike most zits, which know exactly how they want to torture you, this one was an indecisive tormentor, switching back and forth from cystic to pustule and back to cystic again. Since I couldn\u2019t anticipate the zit\u2019s evil whims, my usual methods of attack, such as clay and tea-tree oil, were about as effective as bringing a baguette to a fencing match.\n\nAround the fourth week, I found Dermalogica\u2019s Age Bright Spot Fader in the beauty closet. I took it home, and, to my complete surprise, it started working pretty much immediately. After one night of using it, my heirloom shrunk to the size of a Sungold. Two days later, the bump completely disappeared with no flakiness.\n\nMost pimples linger, leaving behind hyperpigmentation. But this handy Dermalogica stick nipped any scarring right in the bud. The spot left over from my zit \u2014 which would normally take weeks or even months to fade \u2014 is now almost gone. I suspect it\u2019s because of the formula\u2019s clever blend of salicylic acid (which fights pimples) and niacinamide and hexylresorcinol, ingredients proven to help even out skin tone. I\u2019m thankful for this new way to terrorize a zit.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "A review of Dermalogica Age Bright Spot Fader, an acne-fighting product that zaps zits and hyperpigmentation.", "authors": ["Kathleen Hou"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/05/04-dermalogica-spot-fader-feed-b.w1200.h630.jpg"}
