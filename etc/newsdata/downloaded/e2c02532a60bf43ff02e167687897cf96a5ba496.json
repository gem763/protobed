Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet overseeing the Middle East, told the Associated Press that authorities there were \u201caware of reports of this incident,\u201d but he declined to comment further.\n\nAD\n\nOil prices rose on the news. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, climbed 1.7 percent to $60.10 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate crude was up 1.9 percent to $54.58 a barrel in futures trading in London and New York respectively.\n\nAD\n\nThe incident comes amid apparent tit-for-tat attacks on oil tankers and facilities in the Persian Gulf region in recent months, as the United States has tightened sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports as part of its maximum-pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic.\n\nLast month, a drone-and-cruise-missile attack on Saudi oil facilities crippled the desert kingdom\u2019s output. The United States blamed the attack on Iran, which denied involvement. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the assault.\n\nAD\n\nIn July, Iran seized a British-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz just two weeks after an Iranian supertanker was detained off the coast of Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.\n\nAD", "description": "The vessel was near the Saudi port city of Jiddah when it was hit, Iranian media reported.", "authors": ["Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VBhXEEzlz22jrUpn51uapkyJ_Zc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5T7QRBHMCMI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
