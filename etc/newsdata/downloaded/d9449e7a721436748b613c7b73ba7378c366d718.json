(Bonnen has denied any wrongdoing and claimed vindication that he did not act untoward in the meeting in light of the tape\u2019s release.)\n\nDemocrats, who haven\u2019t controlled the state House since 2002, already made inroads there in 2018, picking up 12 seats. Kier Murray, a longtime Texas Democratic strategist, told NBC News that Bonnen\u2019s meeting with the activist put on display the \u201cdiscord\u201d that\u2019s existed between more conservative Republicans and the \u201cbusiness establishment types\u201d for some time.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve largely been able to keep those problems inside the tent over the last few years, but they\u2019re not able to do it anymore,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s somewhat reflective of the stress they feel generally about the state and losing their grip on it, that they\u2019re starting to fight among themselves.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
