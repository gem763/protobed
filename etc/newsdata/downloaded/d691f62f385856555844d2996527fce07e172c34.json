[May\u2019s election adviser Lynton] Crosby approved of it. The sceptic was Hill, who foresaw what would happen.\n\n\"It became the focus of her most bitter disagreement with [fellow No 10 chief of staff Nick] Timothy during their time together in No 10. May backed him. \u2018If I don\u2019t have it in my manifesto, it will become an empty manifesto,\u2019 she said.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSeldon says former aides told him that May sought to avoid speaking to journalists or revealing personal details.\n\n\u201cThis is not what I believe in,\u201d she reportedly said. \u201cI want to be out campaigning.\u201d\n\nHill, with Timothy, said she was forced to travel by May\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cShe was surly and not particularly pleasant,\u201d she told Seldon. \u201cShe was very quiet and seemed unhappy.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnother said: \"She was a terrible campaigner. She came across as grumpy, entitled and expecting to win, and then visibly irritated when she came under scrutiny.\"\n\nThe criticism reached such a level that on social media the PM was dubbed RoboMay for her robotic and repetitive style of delivery.\n\nThe Conservatives had been expected to win a landslide victory in June 2017, but although the party increased its share of the vote it lost 13 seats and its majority as support for Labour surged.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nHowever, after the election result May is said to have blamed her advisers and \"complained bitterly that she had done exactly what they had told her to do and this was the result\".\n\nTimothy offered to resign in the aftermath, at which point Hill recalls May as saying: \u201cI think you both need to resign.\"\n\nMay was also criticised over what was said to be her failure to show a strong face to the public after terrorist attacks in Manchester and London.\n\nSeldon, the vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham who has also written political biographies of Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair , Gordon Brown and David Cameron, writes that the campaign \u201ccruelly exposed her unusually inflexible and introverted character\u201d.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut he reveals that May did not appear to have the final say over some of the messaging.\n\nShe is said not to have liked the \"strong and stable\" slogan which became an oft-repeated mantra.\n\n\"I\u2019m the leader of the Conservative party, not a presidential candidate,\" May said, according to the book. \"I\u2019m not comfortable. I don\u2019t want it to be about me.\"", "description": "The then-Prime Minister's decision to call a snap election in 2017 backfired spectacularly, forcing her to do a deal with the DUP to stay in power", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Afp", "Pa", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10794284.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PROD-British-Prime-Minister-Theresa-May-deliv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
