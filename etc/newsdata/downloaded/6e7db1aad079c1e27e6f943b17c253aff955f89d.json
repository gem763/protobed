California\n\n\u201cIt will be a lot cheaper than a standard Saturday night, \u00a39.99, so around half price,\u201d Hearn said speaking exclusively to The Independent.\n\n\u201cWe want Billy Joe Saunders to be part of the preview, I don\u2019t want to restrict his UK audience viewing. Maybe building up to the night, KSI and maybe one other US fight on PPV.\u201d\n\nWith KSI and Paul possessing a combined subscriber count of over 40m on YouTube, it would make sense to put the fight exactly where the fans are.\n\nHearn disagrees.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of Sky Box Office offering is the ease of the PPV. We do PPV\u2019s from 300,000 buys to 1.4 million buys and everybody knows how to do it and where to find it. It\u2019s just about do we want to do it on YouTube PPV or Sky Box Office PPV, my gut is Sky Box Office PPV because it\u2019s much simpler, everyone understands. These young kids get it, you can put it on any website and they\u2019d find it.\n\n\u201cThis is a one off event, it won\u2019t be Carl Froch, Tony Bellew, Matthew Macklin, it will be an entertainment package. You need to put together from an audience that they understand.\n\n\u201cWhen we did the press conference in America, about 1,000 fans turned up and no one knew who I was. I was walking around and no one knew, same with Matthew Macklin, you need a little bit of that because you need the boxing entertainment but you need guys who appeal to that market.\u201d\n\nNeither man have had a single professional bout before, with just three in the amateur ranks between them. Win or lose, Hearn believes both men could still retain high interest.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Hearn says with a grin about the potential of signing either man to Matchroom.\n\n\u201cThe first fight wasn\u2019t Ali-Frazier but it was decent, it was a good entertaining fight. Someone might get brutally KO\u2019d and then people want to see more of them. If they\u2019re a professional fighter and they go 1-0, who knows!? I\u2019m not looking at it for the future of their careers, I\u2019m looking at it as a one off.\u201d", "description": "The highly anticipated rematch between YouTube stars KSI and Logan Paul will be shown live on Sky Sports Box Office for a \u00a39.99 fee, The Independent can reveal.
