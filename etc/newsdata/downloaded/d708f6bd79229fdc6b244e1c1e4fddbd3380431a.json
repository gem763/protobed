The Obama administration and several Democratic senators at various times pushed Ukraine to cooperate in probes of possible Trump 2016 wrongdoing that eventually turned out not to exist.\n\nIndeed, ongoing Justice Department investigations are trying to determine what if any lines the US intelligence community crossed improperly during those probes.\n\nAnd Trump has been pushing Ukraine, quite appropriately, to cooperate with Justice.\n\nHeck, Ukraine in 2017 started to mend fences over its admitted pro-Hillary Clinton meddling in the 2016 campaign.\n\nIn the press conference, Mulvaney also specifically ruled out any quid pro quo involving Trump\u2019s offhand request to Zelensky to look into Hunter Biden\u2019s activities there \u2014 which is supposedly the central charge in Democrats\u2019 rush to impeachment.\n\nAgain, the fact that Zelensky didn\u2019t know the aid had been frozen is a giant hole in the impeachment case and the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d charge. Indeed, when US diplomat Karl Volker made that point in testimony the other day, Rep. Adam Schiff complained, \u201cAmbassador, you\u2019re making this much more complicated than it has to be.\u201d\n\nFacts, as another president once noted, are stubborn things.", "description": "Except that what Mulvaney \u201cadmitted\u201d is that the administration was doing what it should \u2014 pushing a foreign government to cooperate in getting to the bottom of foreign interference in the 2016 campaign.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/48915293661_mick-mulvaney.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
