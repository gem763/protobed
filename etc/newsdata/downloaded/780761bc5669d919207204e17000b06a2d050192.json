Burn-in happens when the same image is shown on your television\u2019s display for a long period of time. It can be something like a screensaver, or even the menu from something like your Apple TV.\n\nThis week Samsung released a video to help you know what burin-in oaks like and find it on your display.\n\nWorth noting, Samsung doesn\u2019t sell OLED television, which might be behind its motivation for the tool.\n\nTo use it, you just need to stream the minute-long YouTube video, below, onto your television.\n\nWithin the video, it will show you what to be on the lookout for, and a 10-second red screen in the video should make the nasty its on your own television a bit more visible.\n\nIf you do have burn-in, the only way to correct the issue is to get a new TV.
