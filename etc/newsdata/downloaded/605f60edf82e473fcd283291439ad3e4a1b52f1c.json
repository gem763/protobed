The U.S. said the subsidies were illegal and harmed American companies such as Boeing. The WTO agreed and granted the U.S. a $7.5 billion arbitration award and gave President Trump another trade win to tout.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer plans to impose a 10% levy on aerospace products and 25% on agricultural products \u2014 including British cashmere, German roasted coffee and Spanish olive oil \u2014 on Oct. 18.\n\nSome business groups are finding it hard to digest because importers must decide whether to absorb the cost of the tariffs or pass them on to consumers.\n\nThe Specialty Food Association said its products shouldn\u2019t be caught in the crosshairs of a fight that is \u201cpurely industrial\u201d in nature. They said the price of meats, cheeses, olives and other foodstuffs will increase by 25% to keep up with the levies.\n\nMichael Sands, owner of Calvert Woodley Fine Wines and Spirits in the District of Columbia, said there are \u201cstill a lot of unknowns\u201d about the tariffs but the store will have to raise prices if the levies take hold. With his business margins, he said, his store could never just \u201ceat\u201d that kind of increase in the cost of French and Spanish wines or the Italian cheeses it sells. It\u2019s even tougher to swallow on the cusp of the holidays.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no good time of year for this kind of tariff to occur, but this time of year is especially bad, for us and other retailers, as well as wholesalers, consumers \u2014 pretty much everyone,\u201d Mr. Sands said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s awful to get caught in this kind of situation, especially over something that really has nothing to do with wine, liquor, cheese, etc., but this is, unfortunately, the way it goes.\u201d\n\nTariff policy is complex, so analysts predict an array of effects in the marketplace. Shoppers who can afford cashmere will probably still buy luxury sweaters, though coffee drinkers might pick different brands to avoid price shock.\n\nEuropean producers, in turn, may feel a pinch if they lose market share in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all tied together, and that\u2019s why tariffs are so harmful. They affect all parties,\u201d said Gabriella Beaumont-Smith, a macroeconomics policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nMr. Trump insists tariffs are effective for correcting trade imbalances and demanding fairer treatment from other countries.\n\nHe has famously wielded tariffs against China and homed in on French wine, in particular, months ago. France angered the president by taxing digital companies such as Google and Facebook. He said American wine is better, anyway \u2014 even though he is a professed nondrinker.\n\nMr. Trump celebrated the WTO\u2019s decision to approve sweeping levies on Europe last week. He told reporters that he has racked up \u201ca lot of wins at the WTO since I became president.\u201d\n\nThe administration mostly is punishing the four countries responsible for aiding Airbus: the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain. Yet it is spreading the tariff pain across the European Union because of its failure to end the subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe EU collectively bears responsibility for the dispute reaching this point,\u201d the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in a statement to The Washington Times. \u201cThe list also targets products of industries that are important to the EU and will provide incentive for the EU to address its WTO-inconsistent subsidies.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said the tariffs could complicate trade relationships with European nations, especially as the administration eyes a trade deal with the U.K. if and when the British pull out of the EU.\n\nAlthough the targeted products are popular \u2014 Twitter jokesters said tariffs on Scotch should accelerate impeachment proceedings \u2014 analysts said the administration may be betting that consumers won\u2019t change their habits or feel the U.S. can bring in greater revenue by targeting goods that people like.\n\nThe levied items also have plenty of competition. A French wine aficionado could explore a sauvignon blanc from New Zealand, and home cooks could use domestic substitutes for olive oils and cheeses.\n\nThat comes with its own trade-offs, however, because tariffs hit regional products that depend on the unique climate and craftsmanship from distinct corners of Europe.\n\nMr. Sands said customers may look to wines from non-tariffed regions.\n\n\u201cCertain rare Bordeaux and Burgundy can\u2019t really be replicated, but generally speaking there are so many good wines, from all over the world, so the options for customers are practically limitless,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
