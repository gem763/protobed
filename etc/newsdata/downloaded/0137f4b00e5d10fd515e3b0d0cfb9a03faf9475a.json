I suppose if there\u2019s anyone you can\u2019t condemn for pontificating like this, it\u2019s the pontiff. Yet his advice annoyed me, as did some newly published tips aimed at scientists from the novelist Cormac McCarthy, who turns out to have been giving behind-the-scenes editorial advice to leading researchers for years. \u201cRemove extra words or commas whenever you can,\u201d reads McCarthy\u2019s advice (as paraphrased by two of his academic collaborators). Also: \u201cDon\u2019t overelaborate.\u201d Though he\u2019s less of a stickler than Francis when it comes to adjectives: \u201cOnly use an adjective if it\u2019s relevant.\u201d In short, we\u2019re back to William Strunk and EB White\u2019s famous advice in The Elements Of Style: \u201cOmit needless words.\u201d\n\nMy issue with all this isn\u2019t the fact that you can \u2013 who\u2019d have guessed it? \u2013 find plenty of adjectives and adverbs in the pope\u2019s own writing. Nor is it that McCarthy\u2019s admonition against overelaboration is redundant. (Of course you shouldn\u2019t overelaborate; that\u2019s why they call it overelaboration.) As the linguist Geoff Pullum notes, \u201comit needless words\u201d is a bit suspect, too, since clearly you shouldn\u2019t omit needful words, so the word \u201cneedless\u201d is itself needless. So \u201comit words\u201d might make more sense, except that it\u2019s stupid. No, my issue with all this advice to eliminate unnecessary verbiage is: unnecessary for what? Claims of necessity or superfluity imply some end goal, but it\u2019s rare to see one explicitly stated.\n\nAfter all, the complex scientific jargon that McCarthy disdains isn\u2019t usually there, I\u2019d argue, because the authors knew no better; it\u2019s because their goal isn\u2019t solely to communicate, but also to signal their knowledge and qualifications. (This is a bad goal to aim for, I\u2019d say. But so long as academics have powerful incentives to do so, style advice won\u2019t solve things.)\n\nDo as much as you can \u2013 not as little as you can get away with | Oliver Burkeman Read more\n\nMeanwhile, a talented novelist can harness verbosity to good communicative ends. How many of the words in Lucy Ellman\u2019s new 1,000-page novel Ducks, Newburyport are needful? For that matter, how many novels are needful at all? How many of the words ever written truly had to be written, other than signs saying things like \u201cDangerous cliff edge, keep away\u201d, or \u201cWarning: contains bleach\u201d?\n\nIn any case, my hunch is that verbosity of the bad kind rarely arises because the writer hasn\u2019t yet been told, whether by popes or novelists, to cut it out. Rather, it arises when you haven\u2019t properly figured out what it is you\u2019re trying to say. Whenever I\u2019m stuck on how to express something \u2013 or I read my writing back, and have the feeling that it\u2019s missing the point \u2013 the problem is never one of style. It\u2019s that I haven\u2019t clarified exactly what that point is, and that I\u2019ve been engaged in a subconscious effort to avoid having to do so.\n\nSo instead of \u201comit needless words\u201d, try \u201cinvest needful effort\u201d. Make yourself do the job of pinpointing your message, in your own mind, and the writing will come easily. I mean, it probably will. Unlike some, I wouldn\u2019t claim to be infallible.\n\nRead this\n\n\n\nSteven Pinker\u2019s book The Sense Of Style draws on evolutionary theory to show you how to tailor your language to our millennia-old brains.", "description": "You can\u2019t blame the pontiff for pontificating, but his tips annoyed me", "authors": ["Oliver Burkeman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db15f1e7608ec818c16b133395c00e583965a09/0_19_1429_857/master/1429.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=383a1b933e4b50dfef47a3b21fc1216a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
