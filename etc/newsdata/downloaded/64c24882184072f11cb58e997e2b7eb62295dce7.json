Olivia Reiner, PackersNews\n\nGREEN BAY - Green Bay Packers running back Jamaal Williams doesn\u2019t ever want to get knocked out again, but he doesn\u2019t think the NFL needs to bar the guy who did it from playing.\n\nWilliams was cleared from the concussion protocol and in uniform with his teammates at practice Thursday, two weeks from the date in which Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Derek Barnett made helmet-to-helmet contact with a helpless Williams at the end of a running play.\n\nBarnett was flagged for unnecessary roughness but officials did not feel the hit warranted his ejection. However, the league later fined him $28,075 for helmet-to-helmet contact with Williams, who was being held up by two other Eagles at the time Barnett hit him.\n\nWilliams, who spent the night in the hospital, did not receive a call or text from Barnett but said he wasn\u2019t looking for one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m awake, I\u2019m moving around, I\u2019m still playing the game I want to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to hold that in my heart of like, \u2018It\u2019s a dirty shot, I hate him, I hate him.\u2019 I don\u2019t.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles outside linebacker Nigel Bradham (53) tackles Green Bay Packers running back Jamaal Williams (30), injured on the play, during their football game Thursday, September 26, 2019, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis.

Hopefully, he learns from this play and (does) not do it again and keeps playing his type of play but smarter. Keep staying aggressive like he is, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nWilliams said he was knocked out for a few seconds and didn\u2019t really begin to remember what happened until he got to the hospital. He said he watched the play on video later on and came to the conclusion that it was just part of the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad at him for it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s just playing defense. That\u2019s what defense does, they have to go to the ball. At the time I was still fighting for yards and stuff like that. At the time, he didn\u2019t know what was happening. He just turned around and seen me fighting for yards, so he was just trying to go make a football play.\n\n\u201cIt was just bad location where our helmets hit.\u201d\n\nWilliams said he felt fine at practice and was looking forward to returning Monday night when the Packers host the Detroit Lions.\n\nAaron Jones is the starter and No. 1 option in the running game, but Williams will probably jump back into the No. 2 spot ahead of Tra Carson, who was signed from the practice squad last week. Not counting the Eagles game in which he had one carry, Williams has averaged 8.67 carries per game and gained 87 yards. He has eight catches for 55 yards and a touchdown.\n\nIn the last two games, Jones has played 118 of 155 snaps, carried 32 times for 128 yards and five touchdowns and caught 13 passes for 112 yards. Williams should help take some of the load off Jones.\n\n\u201cI feel like me and Aaron have gotten real comfortable in this offense and just playing football in generally,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow, we can just go out there and play.\u201d\n\nReady Randy\n\nTackle Bryan Bulaga credited practice squad linebacker Randy Ramsey with helping him hold off some of the top pass rushers in the game this season.\n\nThrough five games, Bulaga has faced Chicago\u2019s Khalil Mack, Minnesota\u2019s Danielle Hunter, Denver linebacker Von Miller, Dallas end DeMarcus Lawrence and Barnett and has not given up a sack. He and rookie left guard Elgton Jenkins are the only starting linemen who haven\u2019t given up a sack this season.\n\nBulaga said that each week he asks Ramsey, a practice squad outside linebacker, to imitate some of the moves the veteran tackle might see that week. He said the undrafted rookie from Arkansas, whom the Packers seemed to like a lot in training camp, has helped him immensely.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very athletic dude,\u201d Bulaga said. \u201cHe\u2019s able to pick to pick up movements and watch tape on guys and kind of mimic guys. He\u2019s not going to be 100% because he has his own style as well. But he\u2019s done a great job up to this point giving me looks I\u2019m going to see in a game.\u201d\n\nRodgers limited with knee injury\n\nPackers coach Matt LaFleur amended his practice schedule this week to help give his team extra time to recover from a physical game in Dallas last weekend, but wide receiver Davante Adams still was wearing sweats while his teammates warmed up Wednesday on Clarke Hinkle Field.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s getting a little bit better each and every day,\u201d LaFleur said of Adams.\n\nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers was listed as a limited participant with a knee issue, joining a list of 10 other players with such a designation.\n\nThat included center Corey Linsley, who remained in the concussion protocol but did participate to some degree. Other limited participants were defensive linemen Montravius Adams (shoulder) and Kenny Clark (calf), cornerback Kevin King (groin/knee), tight end Marcedes Lewis (heel), safety Will Redmond (shoulder) and wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling (hamstring/calf).\n\nLimited participants due to veteran rest were Bulaga and tight end Jimmy Graham.\n\nWilliams has cleared the concussion protocol after being injured against the Eagles and was a full participant.\n\nOthers who were unable to practice included safety Darnell Savage (left ankle) and tight end Robert Tonyan (hip). Also out was cornerback Tony Brown, who suffered a hamstring injury against the Eagles.\n\nThird-and-long woes\n\nThe NFC North-leading Packers are 27th in the league in overall third-down conversions, making just 30.5% of those tries. The only teams worse on third down are Cleveland (2-3), Pittsburgh (1-4), Miami (0-4), the New York Jets (0-4) and Washington (0-5).\n\nThe Packers consider the edge of a manageable third-down distance at six yards. From third-and-7 and longer the club has run 35 plays and has converted a first down seven times (20%).\n\nLaFleur acknowledged some negative run plays have helped contribute to longer third-down conversion attempts, but usually the culprit is a penalty. Fourteen times the Packers have been flagged to push them back beyond the third-and-manageable range.\n\n\"Well, if I knew right now we wouldn't be in those situations,\u201d LaFleur joked when asked if he had an answer for those issues. \u201cBut, no, there's things that we can do from a coaching perspective, from a play-calling perspective that need to be better. But also, we've got to make sure we're not getting penalties. And then there were a couple negative runs that really set us back. It's just being mindful of what we're asking our guys to do on first down so we don't get into those get-back-on-track situations.\"\n\nAnd as one would expect, the further away the first down marker the less likely the conversion:\n\nThird-and-7: 4-for-9\n\nThird-and-8: 1-for-2\n\nThird-and-9: n/a\n\nThird-and-10: 1-for-8\n\nThird-and-11-15: 1-for-8\n\nThird-and-16-plus: 0-for-8\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that on the Packers\u2019 14 touchdown drives they tend to avoid third down altogether with high early down efficiency and plays of 10-plus yards.\n\nNot including defensive penalties that led to first downs, the Packers have run 79 plays on those touchdown drives. They have gone 7-for-7 on third down, and only one time did they have to convert anything longer than third-and-6, which was a 26-yard completion on third-and-7 against the Eagles.\n\nAnd of those 79 plays, 27 have gone for at least 10 yards (34%).\n\nKicker Mason Crosby has attempted eight field goals, and on those drives the Packers have been faced with 13 third downs. A defensive penalty gave them one first down and the Packers have gone 4-for-12 on the others. Three times they converted with seven or more yards to go.\n\n\u201cWhere we need to show the most improvement is getting out of long-yardage situations and getting back on track,\u201d LaFleur said Monday. \u201cWhether we have a negative run or a negative play on first down, or we get a penalty, or we get into those second-and-longs and are then faced with the third-and-longs, it\u2019s tough to convert in this league. So there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement on third downs for us.\u201d", "description": "Jamaal Williams doesn\u2019t ever want to get knocked out again, but he doesn\u2019t think the NFL needs to bar the guy who did it from playing.", "authors": ["Tom Silverstein", "Jim Owczarski", "Published P.M.
