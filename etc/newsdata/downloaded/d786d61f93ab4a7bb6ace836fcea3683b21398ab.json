European Council President Donald Tusk says the EU is \"open but not convinced\", while Irish PM Leo Varadkar says Mr Johnson's attempts to rework arrangements at the border with Northern Ireland \"fall short in a number of aspects\". Mr Johnson told MPs on Thursday his proposals were a \"genuine attempt to bridge the chasm\".\n\nBBC Europe editor Katya Adler says EU leaders remain uncertain whether Mr Johnson is open for deeper negotiations or focusing his attention on a possible election campaign but adds they won't want to be seen to be \"slamming the door\" in the UK's face.

In an open letter, Home Secretary Priti Patel says it threatens \"lives and the safety of our children\" by frustrating a cross-border agreement allowing British law enforcement agencies to demand US tech firms hand over data relating to serious criminals. Facebook - keen to focus on privacy after scandals over the misuse of personal data - says it is \"consulting closely with child safety experts, governments and technology companies\" about how best to keep people safe.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nKJT finally clinches global gold\n\nAnother day, another new British world athletics champion.

But by the 1980s the town had become a \"no-go zone\", she recalls.\n\nMargate's \u00a317.5m art gallery Turner Contemporary opened in 2011 with hopes it would spearhead the regeneration of one of the most deprived parts of the UK.
