And the D.C. U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has scrutinized allegations that McCabe was not candid with FBI investigators about his role in a news story concerning the FBI\u2019s probe into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nNow, emails reviewed by The Daily Beast cast additional light on the circumstances that preceded McCabe\u2019s firing from the FBI. They show that one FBI official felt the need to clarify to then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that the FBI\u2019s internal investigation into McCabe\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t being slow-walked. And they show that former director of national intelligence James Clapper urged FBI Director Chris Wray to shield McCabe from being fired. They also show that in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election, McCabe shared more information about his media contacts with then-FBI Director James Comey than was previously known.\n\nMcCabe has sued the Justice Department over his firing. The issues these emails shed light on\u2014whether he deserved to be fired and whether the FBI handled the decision correctly\u2014are sure to be front and center if the lawsuit goes to trial.\n\nThe Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a government watchdog group, obtained the emails through FOIA litigation and shared them with The Daily Beast. They are also available in the FBI\u2019s FOIA vault. CREW\u2019s litigation is ongoing.\n\nSome of the emails in the tranche cast light on the FBI\u2019s scramble to deal with media coverage in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. On Oct. 21, 2016, McCabe sent Comey an email with the subject line \u201cUpdates.\u201d Copied on the email were James Rybicki, who was then Comey\u2019s chief of staff, and David Bowdich, who was then associate deputy director of the FBI. McCabe opened with an update on a cyberattack. He then turned to the subject of media.\n\n\u201cIn the more bad news category, Mike K informed me that Devlin Barrett at WSJ is putting together an article claiming I had a conflict of interest on MYR as a result of Jill\u2019s campaign connections to Gov. McCaulife [sic],\u201d McCabe wrote, referring to then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. \u201cI will work with mike to provide some basic facts to push back. And, as always, will keep you advised. I am incredibly sorry for adding to the drama on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cMike K\u201d referred to Mike Kortan, then the FBI\u2019s public affairs chief. \u201cMYR\u201d referred to Midyear, the FBI\u2019s nickname for its investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cOutstanding,\u201d Comey replied to McCabe. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, McCabe updated Comey and Rybicki on his participation in the then-forthcoming Wall Street Journal story.\n\n\u201cNot too much in the update,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe only additional notable news is that Mike K and I spent a good part of the day trying to shape the WSJ story on my alleged conflict,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLooks like they may try to release it on line tonight. The reporter also called Jill for a comment, so we are working that as well.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department Inspector General did not mention the emails in his damning report on McCabe, which focused on his role in a second Wall Street Journal story. The report alleged that McCabe lacked candor when he told FBI investigators about how the Journal obtained information about the Bureau\u2019s internal deliberations for that second story.\n\nOne issue has been whether McCabe told Comey about his participation in that story; McCabe has said he did, but Comey has said he has no recollection of McCabe making the disclosure to him. McCabe\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, argue that the Inspector General\u2019s report is seriously flawed.\n\nScrutiny of McCabe\u2019s work at the FBI grew over the following two years, with congressional Republicans and the president calling for McCabe to be fired and punished. But McCabe also had defenders. Clapper\u2014who has also become a target of the president\u2014sent a handwritten letter to FBI Director Chris Wray on Feb. 25, 2018, praising McCabe and calling for Wray to intercede on his behalf. That letter is in the tranche of documents CREW obtained. In it, Clapper called the criticism of McCabe \u201ccompletely unjustified and profoundly unfair.\u201d", "description": "Alex Wong/GettyFor months, a huge question has hovered over Washington\u2019s legal community: Will the Justice Department charge former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe with a crime?\u00a0In the wake of a New York Times report that his lawyers met with the deputy attorney general about the DOJ\u2019s investigation", "authors": ["Betsy.Woodruff Thedailybeast.Com", "Betsy Woodruff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jygHxg8MLB3otHJ27oXc5A--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/f532ba9ae5e6aa454d514b15b713edbd", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
