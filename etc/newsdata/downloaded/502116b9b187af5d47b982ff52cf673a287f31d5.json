He is pompous and they are above it all. And if I was doing the same thing that that family was doing, I\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Eric Trump responded.\n\nHis comments come as President Trump faces an impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats last month after an anonymous whistleblower made a complaint about a phone call the president shared with Ukraine's leader back in July. The whistleblower alleged that the president \u201csought to pressure\u201d Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cto take actions to help the President\u2019s 2020 reelection bid\u201d by asking him to investigate the Bidens.\n\nIn the weeks since the inquiry has been launched, the president has continued to defend his behavior, and evidence of criminal wrongdoing by either of the Bidens has not been found.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that every family goes into politics and enriches themselves?\u201d Eric Trump asked, referring to the Bidens, during his Fox News appearance.\n\nHe went on to say that his family \u201cstopped at doing deals when my father\u201d became president.\n\n\u201cWe stopped doing deals when he went into politics. Guess what, all these kids, they started doing deals when their families went into politics and it\u2019s sickening,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Trump has faced scrutiny throughout his time in office for failing to fully divest from his business interests after taking office. He recently came under fire this past week from Democrats and Republicans after the White House announced he would be holding the Group of Seven summit next year at his Doral resort near Miami.\n\nAfter receiving a barrage of criticism, President Trump reversed course two days later and cancelled the plans.", "description": "Eric Trump went after former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter,\u00a0with President Trump's son claiming he would be in jail if he \u201cwas doing the same thing that that family was doing.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumperic_trumplaura_kushnerjared_trumpivanka_013018gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
