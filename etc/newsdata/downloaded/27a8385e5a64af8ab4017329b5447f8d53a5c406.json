And Weili Zhang just took her chance, and she made it to the league.\u201d\n\nJedrzejczyk, who defended her title five times, wants people to appreciate just how difficult it is to handle everything that comes with becoming a champion.\n\nShe says there\u2019s a reason no strawweight has been able to remain champ for long outside of her own title reign that lasted more than two years.\n\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t run this division anymore,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cAnd I was the champ for a reason and if people doubt me, I always say, OK, how many title defenses has \u2018x\u2019 strawweight champion, first, second and the third, you know? There\u2019s Ronda Rousey from bantamweight division, six successful title defenses, and me in the strawweight (with) five, and Amanda Nunes is the GOAT right now, but if people doubt me, I say, \u2018Hey, look at the numbers and how long I was holding the belt.'\u201d\n\nWith a win over Michelle Waterson this Saturday, Jedrzejczyk expects to be next in line for a title shot. At least that\u2019s what she said she signed a deal for when she took the fight with the \u201cKarate Hottie\u201d.\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place at Amalie Arena. The card streams on ESPN+.\n\nTo hear more from Jedrzejczyk, watch the video above.
