Prime example: When a commercial flight vanishes over the ocean, you don\u2019t just get the loss of lives and the intense suffering felt by those they leave behind. You also get mass theorizing, a collective mania experienced by everybody else. Planes, being technological marvels in an age of surveillance, aren\u2019t supposed to literally disappear without a trace, right? Except they still can, because extremely low probabilities are still, nonetheless, possibilities. The universe remains chaotic, despite every attempt to make it knowable and controllable.\n\nThe contrails of this mania drift at the edges of Passenger List, the new Radiotopia fiction podcast that debuted last month. Six episodes deep at this writing, the series follows a college student, Kaitlin Le (The Last Jedi\u2019s Kelly Marie Tran), as she works to figure out the truth behind the sudden disappearance of a transatlantic flight, which held her twin brother as a passenger. Rejecting the explanation given by aviation officials \u2014 bird aircraft strike hazard, more common than you would think but almost always non-consequential \u2014 Le, aided by an anonymous helper (The Fall\u2019s Colin Morgan, via voice modulator), sets out to chase down lead after lead, working her way through an increasingly sprawling web of theories that may or may not lead her to the truth she\u2019s so desperately looking for.\n\nFundamental to Passenger List, which is written and directed by John Scott Dryden (Tumanbay, LifeAfter) and Lauren Shippen (The Bright Sessions), is its structural conceit: Each episode is built around a different lead, which in turn revolves around a different person on the flight. As the series goes on, so grows the list of leads and suspects, which gets unspooled to varying levels of outlandishness. One lead trains Le\u2019s suspicion onto the pilot, a single woman that some suspect may have been debilitatingly depressed. Another focuses her on the possibility of Ebola contracted by a middle-aged couple returning from a trip to Central Africa. Other topical bombshells, from terrorism to international crime syndicates to Russia, flutter in and out of focus at one point or another. Proceeding in this manner, the episodes collectively make up a carousel of character sketches that double as theories behind the overarching mystery, offering Dryden and Shippen ample opportunity to weave different ideas into the mix while playing up the puzzle-box element of the show\u2019s premise.\n\nIt\u2019s an efficient format but a complicated one. Evoking contemporary real-world air disasters \u2014 whether it\u2019s the disappearance of MH370 or the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash, deliberately caused by a co-pilot previously assessed to be suicidal \u2014 inevitably means having to evoke vast galaxies of conspiracy theories, whose stubborn persistence in the edges of culture continues to loom over those actually affected by the tragedies to this day. At times, the show\u2019s scripting suggests a desire to comment on, or perhaps even critique, the fantastical nature of conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe show manages to lean into that darker side of the ledger with deftness. The leads that Le pursues aren\u2019t just built on working theories; viewed from an objective distance, they are also clear representations of actual conspiracy theories we can detect in the real world. And so the podcast surfaces a bigger, thornier conundrum: What do we learn from emotionally rationalizing conspiratorial thinking? Which is to say: Does Le\u2019s hurt justify her indulging of conspiracy theories?\n\nAcross its first batch of episodes, you can feel the podcast using all of these threads to say something interesting about grief, about the impulse to reject the reality of a chaotic, uncaring universe. However, there\u2019s a haziness to the way it handles this exploration. Part of this has to do with the show\u2019s actual episodic character sketches, some of which feel a little underbaked. But most of this, I think, has to do with the show\u2019s commitment to genre tropes. Episodes end with cliffhangers and the promise of another lead. A midpoint revelation recontextualizes what we understand about Le\u2019s brother, suggesting a far more fantastical story arc. Sometimes it works, other times not so much; the show\u2019s commitment to genre pillars sometimes comes into harsh conflict with the delicate ideas it wants to tackle.\n\nOn a technical level, the podcast is a marvel. Passenger List sounds amazing. Sporting fantastic sound design and orchestration by Mark Phillips (who previously worked on Serial and Homecoming), the podcast\u2019s world feels vivid and tangible. The series leans on the classic found-footage trope \u2014 common among genre-fiction podcasts \u2014 with much of the action playing out over phone calls, recorded conversations, archived audio, and so on. But the production refreshingly plays it fast and loose, mostly using the popular technique to establish a sense of place but breaking its adherence whenever appropriate to keep close to the performances. Even the show\u2019s advertising gimmick is noteworthy: Ad reads are performed as in-flight announcements, doubling as a horrifying vision of our capitalist near future.\n\nUnder Dryden and Shippens\u2019s direction, the podcast also offers solid performances. Tran is asked to do a lot, serving as the emotional anchor and scaffolding for the entire plot, but she delivers. Of particular note are the scenes between Le and her parents, marked by an organic tension that comes not just from being psychologically apart, grief-wise, but generationally as well. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the series\u2019 standout performance so far comes from stage legend Patti LuPone, who pops up in the fourth episode and completely takes over; her delivery gives a remarkable level of subtlety, restraint, and gravity to a character who might have otherwise been an off-beat throwaway (specifically, a psychic).\n\nPassenger List is an exemplary fiction podcast, particularly in how it refines many of the genre\u2019s core mechanics and takes them to the next level. It also seems deeply interested in its heavy themes. What, in the end, does this missing-plane drama really want to say about grief? We\u2019re not sure yet, but it\u2019s flying in the right direction.", "description": "The missing-plane fiction podcast Passenger List, starring Kelly Marie Tran and Patti LuPone, looks at what happens when grief meets conspiracy theory.", "authors": ["Nicholas Quah"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-passenger-list-podcast-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
