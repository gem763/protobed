The results were so catastrophic that now we\u2019ll do anything to avoid dropping another one.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how John Lombardi, former president of the University of Florida, described the so-called \u201cdeath penalty\u201d levied upon Southern Methodist University in 1987 after the NCAA determined that the school had been paying several of its football players.\n\nUntil the punishment came down\u2014on this day, Feb. 25, in 1987\u2014SMU had seemed like the opposite of a cautionary tale. The tiny Dallas university, with just 6,000 students, had finished its 1982 season undefeated, ranking No. 2 in the nation and winning the Cotton Bowl, and added a second Southwest Conference championship to its r\u00e9sum\u00e9 two years later. The SMU of the early 1980s stood toe-to-toe with conference powers Texas, Texas A&M and Arkansas\u2014and proved itself their equal.\n\nTrouble was, SMU needed help standing with those giants. There aren\u2019t many ways to build a dominant football program on the fly, but if you\u2019re going to try, you need a coach who can convince a bunch of teenagers that they\u2019re better off coming to your unheralded program than they are heading down the road to Austin or College Station or hopping a plane to Los Angeles or South Bend. That\u2019s no easy task, even for a recruiter as gifted as Ron Meyer, who became SMU\u2019s head coach in 1976. Sometimes promises of playing time or TV exposure aren\u2019t enough\u2014especially when your competitors are offering the same things, only more and better. Though the Mustangs weren\u2019t caught till a decade after Meyer arrived in Dallas, there\u2019s every reason to suspect SMU and its boosters had been bending the rules for years.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The death penalty\u2014part of the \u201crepeat violators\u201d rule in official NCAA parlance\u2014wiped out SMU\u2019s entire 1987 season and forced the Mustangs to cancel their 1988 campaign as well. So, when Lombardi compared the punishment to the nuclear option, in 2002, the analogy seemed like an apt one. For years, scorched earth was all that remained of the SMU football program, and of the idea of paying players.\n\nNow, however, the conversation has changed.\n\nDallas itself played a major role in the rapid rise and ferocious fall of the Mustangs. By the 1970s, the northern Texas city was a growing metropolis, a hub for businessmen who had recently acquired their fortunes thanks to oil and real estate. Virtually to a man, each had a college football team he supported, and with that support came an intense sense of pride, not to mention competition. Combine that environment with the enormous success of the NFL\u2019s Dallas Cowboys during the 1970s as they assumed the title of \u201cAmerica\u2019s team,\u201d and it\u2019s easy to see how so much pressure was placed on SMU.\n\nWith Ron Meyer\u2019s arrival at the university, the goal became to dovetail the success of the Cowboys with the Mustangs\u2019 performance\u2014and he fit right in with the image that Dallas had begun to embody. He was brash, he was charming, he was dapper; the comparisons with Dallas\u2019 J.R. Ewing came all too easily. And like Ewing, Meyer could be ruthless, pursuing recruits throughout eastern Texas with near-mythic fervor.\n\nAnd the best myths have a dragon to slay. For Meyer, that dragon was Eric Dickerson. Dickerson was one of the nation\u2019s top prospects\u2014a high school running back so gifted he could have chosen any school in the country to play for in 1979. By all accounts, SMU wasn\u2019t even in the running. They\u2019d come a long way toward respectability since Meyer had arrived, but still weren\u2019t on a level with Oklahoma or USC or Notre Dame. Plus, Dickerson had already committed to Texas A&M (and famously received a Pontiac Trans-Am that SMU supporters had dubbed the \u2018Trans A&M\u2019 right around the same time). But then, suddenly, miraculously, Dickerson had a change of heart. He decommitted from A&M and picked SMU shortly thereafter.\n\nTo this day, that decision remains a mystery wrapped in an enigma. There\u2019s a section of ESPN 30 for 30\u2019s excellent documentary about the SMU scandal, The Pony Exce$$\u2014a riff on the SMU backfield, Dickerson and classmate Craig James, which was dubbed \u2018The Pony Express\u2019\u2014about Dickerson\u2019s recruiting process. No one involved, from Meyer to the boosters to Dickerson himself, would say how he really ended up at SMU. But none of them were able to contain the smirks that crept across their faces when they talked about the coup. There\u2019s a reason that a popular sports joke in the early \u201980s was that Dickerson took a pay-cut when he graduated and went to the NFL.\n\nDickerson changed everything for the Mustangs. With him powering SMU\u2019s vaunted offense, the team became a force to be reckoned with in the Southwest Conference. Greater success, however, brought with it greater scrutiny. SMU was in a difficult position because Dallas had such a vibrant and competitive sports media scene (led by the Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times Herald) at the time\u2014one increasingly focused on investigative journalism in the wake of Watergate. The school\u2019s status as a relative neophyte in the world of big-time college football and lack of rapport with the NCAA also did them no favors. There\u2019s little question that other programs in the Southwest Conference were engaged in recruiting practices that bent the rules when it was possible, but none had quite as many eyes on them as the Mustangs.\n\nBobby Collins took over in 1982 and led SMU to its undefeated season, after Meyer left to be head coach of the hapless New England Patriots, but the Mustangs would never again reach those dizzying heights. Despite a growing recruiting reach, Collins failed to lure top-caliber prospects to Dallas, even with the help of the program\u2019s increasingly notorious group of boosters. Instead, SMU became better known for its damning misfires, the first of which was Sean Stopperich, a prep star from Pittsburgh. Stopperich was paid $5,000 to commit and moved his family to Texas, but SMU had failed to realize that Stopperich\u2019s career as a useful football player was already over. The offensive lineman had blown out his knee in high school, spent little time on the field for the Mustangs and left the university after just one year. Upon his departure from SMU, Stopperich became the first key witness for the NCAA in its pursuit of SMU.\n\nThe first round of penalties came down in 1985, banning SMU from bowl games for two seasons and stripping the program of 45 scholarships over a two-year period. At the time, those were considered some of the harshest sanctions in NCAA history. In response, Bill Clements, chairman of the board of governors for SMU, hung a group of the school\u2019s boosters\u2014dubbed the \u201cNaughty Nine\u201d by the media\u2014out to dry, blaming them for the program\u2019s infractions and the university\u2019s sullied reputations.\n\nShortly thereafter, the NCAA convened a special meeting to discuss new, harsher rules for cheating, the most severe of which was the death penalty. (Despite Texas\u2019 reputation as a pro-death penalty state for felons, its universities were some of the new rules\u2019 staunchest opponents.) Still, due to the sanction\u2019s power, few believed it would ever be used.\n\nIf SMU had cut off its payments to players immediately, it might not have been. Instead, the school and its boosters implemented a \u201cphase-out\u201d plan, which meant they would continue paying the dozen or so athletes to whom they had promised money until their graduation. One of those students-athletes, David Stanley, came forward after being kicked off the team and gave a televised interview outlining the improper benefits he had received from SMU. His words alone may not have been enough to damn the university, but an appearance on Dallas\u2019 ABC affiliate, WFAA, by Coach Collins, athletic director Bob Hitch and recruiting coordinator Henry Lee Parker sealed the program\u2019s fate.\n\nTheir interview with WFAA\u2019s sports director Dale Hansen is a mesmerizing watch. Hansen sets a beautiful trap for Parker involving a letter that the recruiting director had initialed, and the recruiting coordinator walks right into it, all but proving that payments to players came directly from the recruiting office. The fact that Parker, Collins and Hitch looked uncomfortably guilty the entire time didn\u2019t help their case.\n\nThe NCAA continued gathering evidence, and on Feb. 25, 1987\u2014a gray, drizzly day in Dallas\u2014it announced it would be giving SMU the death penalty. The man who made the announcement, the NCAA Director of Enforcement David Berst, fainted moments after handing down the sentence, in full view of the assembled media. SMU football, for all intents and purposes, was dead. The team managed just one winning season from 1989 to 2008, in no small part because the rest of the university community had decided it wanted nothing to do with a program that had brought so much infamy to the school.\n\nThe initial reaction to the penalty\u2014both in Dallas and throughout the country\u2014was one of shock. The Mustangs had gone from undefeated to non-existent in just five years. Few, however, could deny that if the NCAA were going to have a death penalty, then SMU was certainly deserving of it. But the fallout from the penalty was worse than anticipated; perhaps not coincidentally, in the decades since 1987, the penalty has never once been used against a Division I school.\n\nOver the last two decades, the conversation that surrounded SMU\u2019s fall from grace has changed even more. These days, those in and around the world of college sports don\u2019t talk much about what the penalties for paying players should be; instead, many are wondering whether there should be any penalty at all for paying college athletes. The arguments in favor of paying college athletes are manifold, especially considering they often generate millions on behalf of their universities. Few, however, would argue that players should be paid in secret (or while still in high school). Any sort of pecuniary compensation that student-athletes receive would, as in pro sports, require some sort of regulation.\n\nDespite the recent groundswell of support, the NCAA appears reluctant to change its rules. At some point, the governing body of college sports may not have a choice, especially if wants to avoid further legal trouble.\n\nRon Meyer, the SMU coach who nabbed Eric Dickerson more than 25 years ago, would famously walk into high schools throughout Texas and pin his business card to the biggest bulletin board he could find. Stuck behind it would be a $100 bill. That sort of shenanigan may not be the future of college sports, but we may be getting closer to the day when money isn\u2019t a four-letter word for student-athletes.\n\nRead TIME\u2019s 2013 cover story about the ongoing debate over paying college athletes, here in the TIME Vault: It\u2019s Time to Pay College Athletes\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "On Feb. 25, 1987, the SMU football team was suspended for an entire season.
