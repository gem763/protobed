This is a scam,\u201d he said at an event on trade with Japan.\n\nMr Trump and other administration officials have repeatedly rejected requests for information and testimony in the Democrats\u2019 investigations.\n\nThe state department ignored a subpoena for documents on Friday, and an attorney for two of Mr Giuliani\u2019s associates who work on the Ukraine matter, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, rebuffed another request Monday.\n\n\u201c ... Overly broad and unduly burdensome,\u201d John Dowd, who is representing Mr Parnas and Mr Fruman, wrote to House investigators.\n\n\u201cThis, in combination with requiring immediate responses, leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the Democratic committee members\u2019 intent is to harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.\u201d\n\nThe highly unusual arrangement for the whistleblower\u2019s testimony underscores the toxicity between Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, which was once considered among the most bipartisan but is now spearheading the divisive impeachment investigation.\n\nOne individual familiar with the discussions said this is the first time the panel has had to take such extraordinary measures to protect a witness \u2013 including from the individual\u2019s own GOP colleagues.\n\nIn a further sign of the breakdown of comity, the committee majority restricted access to the visitor logbook after GOP staffers leaked names of individuals signing in for job interviews when the majority was hiring new staff in early 2019, according to a committee aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe the situation.\n\nOf the whistleblower, Mr Trump has said he wants to meet his \u201caccuser\u201d and has warned of \u201cbig consequences\u201d.\n\nMr Trump even alluded to the death penalty for individuals who gave information to the whistleblower, likening them to spies and outraging longtime whistleblower advocates who called his comments chilling.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented second and thirdhand information, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u2018whistleblower\u2019,\u201d Mr Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cWas this person spying on the US president? Big consequences!\u201d\n\nDemocrats are concerned that without such rare precautions for the whistleblower, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee could learn and then leak the name of the individual, who has agreed to answer questions before the intelligence committees in the House and Senate.\n\nAndrew Bakaj, a lawyer representing the whistleblower, sent a letter to acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire expressing fears for his client\u2019s safety.\n\nMr Bakaj also noted that \u201ccertain individuals\u201d have issued a $50,000 \u201cbounty\u201d for \u201cany information\u201d relating to his client\u2019s identity.\n\nHouse Democratic chairmen, meanwhile, immediately cried foul and accused Mr Trump of \u201cwitness intimidation\u201d \u2013 even as some of his staunchest Capitol Hill allies also began pushing for the disclosure of the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\nOn Sunday, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Lindsey Graham said that if the House impeaches Mr Trump, \u201cI will make sure\u201d the whistleblower faces public questioning.\n\n\u201cIf the whistleblower\u2019s allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it\u2019s imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public, under oath, and cross-examined,\u201d Mr Graham said on Fox News.\n\nIn the House, Democrats overseeing the logistics of the testimony for the House impeachment inquiry are leaning towards a staff-only session that would prevent lawmakers from attending and asking questions, according to officials familiar with the conversations.\n\nAides have even considered having the whistleblower testify from a separate location via a video hookup in which the camera would obscure the whistleblower\u2019s image and alter his voice, possibly with modification technology.\n\nTwo other possibilities include having the whistleblower sit behind a screen or partition, or conducting audio-only testimony.\n\n\u201cSchiff does not want to burn his identity,\u201d a senior congressional official said.\n\nDetails for the whistleblower\u2019s testimony are still being worked out, the officials said. Little can be finalised until security clearances for the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers are resolved so they can begin more substantive discussions about logistics, they said.\n\nMark Zaid, one of three lawyers for the whistleblower, said that as of Monday, two have their clearances; the third needs only to sign documents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a logistics issue,\u201d Mr Zaid said. \u201cIt will happen over the next couple of days.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s legal team is also in discussions with the Senate Intelligence Committee about testifying, according to one individual familiar with the talks.\n\nThe Senate panel, headed by Richard Burr and Mark Warner, is known for a more bipartisan approach; its staffers are not considering the extraordinary measures being discussed by the House.\n\nThe House and Senate committees are expected to meet separately with the whistleblower \u2013 both likely away from the Capitol.\n\nThe off-campus meetings probably will be in a secure room provided by the executive branch, according to officials. The meetings could take place \u201cwithin the next couple of weeks\u201d, but no date has been set, one official said.\n\nShould the whistleblower testify from another location, the House panel could ask Intelligence Community inspector general Michael Atkinson to confirm the identity of the whistleblower.\n\nMr Atkinson, who adjudicated the whistleblower\u2019s complaint in August, determined that the whistleblower\u2019s allegations were credible and constituted an \u201curgent\u201d concern to national security.\n\nCongressional aides have been discussing the possibility of a transcript from the testimony, but whether the whistleblower\u2019s legal team agrees to that depends on whether the individual\u2019s identity can be protected.\n\nThe lawyers would not want information shared that could identify the whistleblower.\n\nThe legal team has been hired by a second witness, one who had firsthand knowledge of the events in the complaint.\n\nSo far, there has been no discussion with Capitol Hill about that person speaking with Congress. That would require permission from the director of national intelligence, but that\u2019s \u201cpro forma\u201d at this point, an official said.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "House Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted an impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent Donald Trump\u2019s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations.
