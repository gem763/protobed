I adapted the recipe from a sandwich served at Defonte\u2019s Sandwich Shop, on Columbia Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn. It is a beautiful torpedo of food, crunchy, silken, sweet and spicy all at once. You can certainly omit the roast beef to make it vegetarian or at any rate a little smaller, the sort of meal that offers satisfaction without hurting anyone, that delivers deliciousness at a lower cost to the body that consumes it. It is still a colossal feed. It is still the best sandwich.\n\nFeatured in: The Best Sandwich Ever.", "description": "In the spring of 2016, my most favorite sandwich was fried eggplant, mozzarella and roast beef on an Italian hero, with hot peppers and a slash of mayonnaise I adapted the recipe from a sandwich served at Defonte\u2019s Sandwich Shop, on Columbia Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn It is a beautiful torpedo of food, crunchy, silken, sweet and spicy all at once", "authors": ["Sam Sifton", "Mark Bittman", "Melissa Clark", "Nigella Lawson", "Julia Moskin", "Alison Roman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/01/magazine/01eat1/01eat1-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.png", "published_at": "2016-05-01"}
