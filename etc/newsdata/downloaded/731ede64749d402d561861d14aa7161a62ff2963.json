A Dane County jury on Tuesday decided the amount James Fetzer must pay Leonard Pozner, whose 6-year-old son Noah was among the 26 victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nFetzer, a retired University of Minnesota Duluth professor now living in Wisconsin, and Mike Palacek co-wrote a book, \"Nobody Died at Sandy Hook\" in which they claimed the Sandy Hook shooting never took place but was instead an event staged by the federal government as part of an Obama administration effort to enact tighter gun restrictions. A judge earlier ruled Pozner was defamed by statements in the book that claimed he fabricated copies of his son's death certificate.\n\nFetzer called the damages amount \"absurd\" and said he would appeal.\n\nPalacek reached a settlement with Pozner last month, terms of which were not disclosed.\n\n\"It causes people to believe that I lied about my son's death, that my son didn't die and that I'm somehow doing that for some other reasons,\" Pozner said, CBS affiliate WISC-TV reported.\n\n\"Mr. Fetzer has the right to believe that Sandy Hook never happened,\" he said. \"He has the right to express his ignorance. This award, however, further illustrates the difference between the right of people like Mr. Fetzer to be wrong and the right of victims like myself and my child to be free from defamation, free from harassment and free from the intentional infliction of terror.\"\n\nPozner testified during the trial that he's been repeatedly harassed by people who don't believe the Sandy Hook shooting occurred, including through messages posted to photos of his son on a memorial website. He said Fetzer's writing caused him to worry about his safety and his family's safety and how his surviving children could be treated. One of his two daughters is Noah's twin.\n\nEarlier this year the publisher of the book apologized to Pozner.", "description": "Jury awards $450,000 to the father of a boy killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting after he filed a defamation lawsuit against conspiracy theorists who claimed massacre never happened", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/16/96fe4b81-901b-48ea-aaa1-7031d0c038ce/thumbnail/1200x630/c19acf254ad7277562b6fabc25a57d47/noah-pozner-gettyimages-158474101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
