He alleged that in this way, Lutsenko was taking revenge for the notices of suspicion being issued against Poroshenko\u2019s allies.\n\nLutsenko\u2019s spokeswoman Larysa Sargan did not respond by phone, while Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, did not respond to a written request for comment.\n\nKulik, who had been a deputy head of the international legal cooperation department and head of the department\u2019s prosecution unit, said that his job no longer existed.\n\nHe also said that due to the disbanding of the units, major corruption investigations against ex-President Viktor Yanukovych and his allies had been halted.\n\nJournalist Volodymyr Boyko posted a copy of Lutsenko\u2019s order to disband the units.\n\nProsecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko\u2019s order to liquidate two units at the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office (Volodymyr Boyko).\n\nIn March, Kulik issued notices of suspicion against Valeria Gontareva, the former head of the National Bank of Ukraine, Kostyantyn Stetsenko, a top executive at investment bank ICU, Poroshenko\u2019s former Chief of Staff Borys Lozhkin, and his Deputy Chief of Staff Oleksiy Filatov.\n\nHowever, Sargan, a spokeswoman for the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, said in March that the leadership of her agency believed the notices of suspicion to be unlawful and invalid.\n\nSergii Gorbatuk, head of the in absentia cases unit at the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, told the Kyiv Post that the leadership of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office had no right to cancel notices of suspicion issued by prosecutors.\n\nAnti-corruption activists, including Reanimation Package of Reforms expert Oleksandr Lemenov, said Sargan\u2019s statement indicated that Lutsenko wanted to save the allies of his political boss Poroshenko.\n\nOn April 11, Kulik alleged that Poroshenko had illegally interfered in the case against his allies.\n\nPoroshenko denied the accusations on April 11. He claimed that Kulik had gone to Israel, where tycoon Igor Kolomoisky lives, and decided to take part in the oligarch\u2019s political activities. Kolomoisky denied meeting Kulik.\n\nKulik also denied traveling to Israel and meeting Kolomoisky. He in turn accused Lutsenko and Oleksandr Hranovsky, a top Poroshenko ally, of blocking investigations against Kolomoisky. Lutsenko\u2019s office and Hranovsky did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut a day after the April 21 run-off of the Ukrainian presidential election, in which comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy beat Poroshenko, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office issued summonses to the Poroshenko allies.\n\nThe suspects were to be questioned and charged on April 23 and April 25.\n\nHowever, Filatov and Lozhkin said they would not go to the questioning, arguing that the publication of the summonses through the Internet was illegal. Gontareva, who lives in London, also said she would not come, while Stetsenko declined to comment.\n\nGontareva and Stetsenko are expected to be charged with aiding organized crime and complicity in embezzling Hr 2 billion ($74 million) by buying and selling government bonds.\n\nGontareva, Lozhkin and Filatov are also expected to be charged with complicity in laundering over $440 million through the 2013 sale of UMH, a major international media company founded by Lozhkin.\n\nThe Prosecutor General\u2019s Office is also planning to charge Yanukovych\u2019s Ecology Minister Mykola Zlochevsky with laundering $36 million.\n\nAll of the suspects have previously denied the accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nKulik has been hit by scandal himself.\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine in 2016 charged Kulik with unlawful enrichment of Hr 2 million ($80,000). The case was closed in March after the Constitutional Court in late February canceled a law on illegal enrichment.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.kyivpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PET_1368.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-30"}
