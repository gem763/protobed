She spent Sunday boarding up her windows and moving her outdoor furniture \u2014 which wind gusts could turn into projectiles \u2014 into her house.\n\nLavoie says she hasn't been ordered to leave and isn't confident in the forecasts. She says residents have been highly anxious over the past few days because the predicted location where Dorian will make landfall has changed several times.\n\nFormer Gatineau, Que., resident Julie Lavoie has been living in West Palm Beach, Fla., since 2007. With Hurricane Dorian bearing down, the realtor plans to remain in her home. (Radio-Canada)\n\n\"Where are you going to go? Two years ago [during Hurricane Irma] they told people to go to the west coast. And the hurricane hit on the west,\" said Lavoie.\n\n\"There is a lack of gas. Do you want to ride out the storm in the middle of nowhere?\"\n\nInstead, Lavoie said she's planning to hunker down in her house. She has stockpiled nearly 20 litres of water and several large jerry cans of gas for her generator.\n\n'Spooky' quiet in resort town\n\nJust a short drive up the Florida coast, Sean Stinson is literally battening down the hatches.\n\nThe 45-year-old London, Ont., man has been living on his catamaran in the community of Riviera Beach since retiring two years ago.\n\nWith most of the tourists gone, a \"spooky\" quiet has descended on the resort town, Stinson said.\n\nMost of the boat owners he knows have left to seek shelter in the Florida Everglades in the southern tip of the state's panhandle. Stinson says he didn't go because he's concerned Hurricane Dorian could turn unexpectedly, and if it hit the Everglades, it would be difficult for emergency resopnders to reach him.\n\nA man stands on a store's roof in the Bahamas as he works to prepare it for the arrival of Hurricane Dorian on Sunday, Sept. 1, 2019. (Ramon Espinosa/The Associated Press)\n\nInstead, Stinson spent Sunday moving his catamaran away from other vessels and tying it as securely as he could to the concrete dock.\n\nHe admits it's not much of a guarantee against the unpredictable nature of a storm that's being labelled the strongest hurricane in modern times.\n\n\"If we get surge over eight feet here ... the floating docks will come off the top. And they're all concrete, so there will be floating pieces of concrete with boats attached to them,\" Stinson said. \"And you can speculate what will happen from there.\"\n\nStinson is going to wait out the storm at a friend's home which should withstand a \"moderate hurricane.\" He's taking a risk, hoping that after battering the Bahamas, Dorian will pull some of its punches\n\nScenes from Abacos Islands as one couple fled Hurricane Dorian this morning.

They showed ocean water sweeping through village streets and gas station canopies bending in the wind.\n\nArty was initially unable to confirm his parents made it to safety, but found some comfort several hours later through second-hand news.\n\n\"My little brother told me he talked to my dad, but he hasn't gotten word back if he has evacuated. But he heard my mom got out,\" Arty said.", "description": "One former Gatineau, Que., resident spent Sunday boarding up the windows of her Florida home as the Category 5 storm slammed into the Bahamas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5267619.1567384562!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tropical-weather-bahamas-hurricane-dorian.jpg"}
