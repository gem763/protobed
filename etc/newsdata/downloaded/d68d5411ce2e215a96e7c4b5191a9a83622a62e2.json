That\u2019s at the very lower end of the Swiss National Bank\u2019s target range, which is rising prices at a rate below 2%.\n\nThe drop follows a surge in the currency this year that the SNB has attempted to curb with currency market interventions. The franc hit a two-year high versus the euro in early September, and the central bank slashed its inflation forecasts.\n\nWith its benchmark already at -0.75%, the central bank has so far resisted cutting interest rates, despite a reduction last month by the European Central Bank.\n\nYet the KOF institute on Wednesday predicted a cut of as much as 25 basis points before year-end. The next scheduled policy decision isn\u2019t due until December, but the SNB has a history of surprises if it feels it needs to act before then.\n\nPolicy makers say the franc is highly valued and they continue to threaten to sell the franc as needed to stem its appreciation. Governing Board Member Andrea Maechler said Wednesday that monetary policy must remain expansive, Reuters reported.\n\nThe SNB sees prices rising just 0.2% next year, recovering slightly to 0.6% the following year.\n\n--With assistance from Catherine Bosley.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Fergal O'Brien in Zurich at fobrien@bloomberg.net;Jan Dahinten in Zurich at jdahinten@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at cstirling1@bloomberg.net, Fergal O'Brien\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
