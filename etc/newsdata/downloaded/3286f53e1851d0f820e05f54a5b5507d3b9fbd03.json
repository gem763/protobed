It was the second time he had been assaulted.\n\nFive victims of attacks have reported assaults to the police, but only three men have so far been arrested - for the initial assault on Sham.\n\nIsaac Cheng, a 19-year-old student and vice chairman of the pro-democracy Demosisto party, was beaten by three men in early September outside his family home after he helped organise a school strike.\n\n\"I am confident in the police's capability to solve the case, but I am not confident in them actually doing it given the severity of selective law enforcement,\" Mr Cheng said.\n\nHong Kong's police have denied allegations of bias, saying they pursue all crimes regardless of political motivation.\n\nREPUTATION HAMMERED\n\nBut the force's reputation was hammered in late July after officers took nearly 40 minutes to respond to an attack by a group of men on pro-democracy protesters at Yuen Long train station.\n\nOfficers were filmed allowing men armed with sticks to leave the area in the hours afterwards.\n\nPolice have arrested 34 people for that attack, some with links to triad crime groups, and deny accusations they allowed the Yuen Long assault to happen.\n\nHaunted by fear and a shortage of trust in the police, pro-democracy figures say they now arrange their own protection, although their options are limited.\n\n\"All I can do is be more careful and recruit more volunteers so I don't have to work a street booth alone,\" said Janelle Leung, 25, a local election candidate who was attacked while campaigning.\n\nDavin Wong, a former leader of the University of Hong Kong's student union, moved abroad after he was attacked.\n\nBut most victims refuse to be cowed.\n\n\"I do worry such attacks will be more frequent and serious,\" said Roy Kwong, a pro-democracy lawmaker who was attacked last month by a gang of men, one of whom filmed the beating.\n\n\"One important way to overcome fear is to continue our normal life and show those in the shadows that we are not intimidated.\"\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] The men jumped Stanley Ho without warning, smashing both his hands with metal rods - one of multiple recent attacks against prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy figures that activists have dubbed a \"white terror\". .
