Glenn Beck Releases Audio of Ukrainian Official Admitting He Interfered In U.S. Election to Help \u2018Hillary\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Glenn Beck has just released an audiotape of the former Director of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), Artem Sytnyk, admitting he \u201chelped\u201d Hillary during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Sytnyk was convicted for election interference in December 2018 in Kiev. The court ruled that the publication of the \u201cblack ledger\u201d documents \u201cled to interference in the electoral processes of the United States in 2016 and harmed the interests of Ukraine as a state.\u201d\n\nOn the tape, he tells his friends, \u201cKolya\u201d and \u201cIvan,\u201d that \u201cI was in charge of the investigation of their \u201cblack accounting\u201d records. We made the [sic] Manafort\u2019s data available to general public.\u201d\n\nNote: On Aug. 19, 2016, Serhiy Leshchenko, then the acting Ukrainian Prosecutor General, held a press conference in Kiev where he revealed the \u201cblack ledger\u201d of the Party of Regions. Leshchenko said it contained \u201cpreviously secret records of payments made by the former pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych\u201d to then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Yanukovych\u2019s government was overthrown during the Ukrainian Revolution and he fled the country in February 2014. Leshchenko told reporters that \u201cthe information was obtained by an anonymous source in the burned-out ruins of the headquarters of Yanukoych\u2019s party.\u201d It\u2019s unknown if the ledger was authentic or forged. Either way, it showed that large cash payments had been made to Paul Manafort. The revelation forced him to resign from the Trump campaign and signaled the start of his legal problems.\n\nBeck said this tape has been floating around Ukraine for a while, but it was only recently translated into English.\n\nHere is a transcript of the tape. Scroll down for the audiotape (Sytnyk\u2019s conversation begins at 4:00).\n\nKolya: Did they, those Russians, help Trump? Your people? Sytnyk: I think they did. Yeah. I helped him, too. Not him, but Hillary. I helped her. Kolya: Yeah. Right. Then her position tottered, right? Sytnyk: Well, this is how they write about it, right. Ivan: Hillary\u2019s humanitarian aid \u2026 [indiscernible.] Kolya: Well, I\u2019m about \u2026 the commentaries. At the time, we were not [indiscernible.] Sytnyk: Trump \u2026 his purely inner problem \u2026 issue \u2026 they dominate over the external matters. While Hillary, she is \u2014 how shall I put it? She belongs to the cohort of politicians who comprise the hegemony in the US. Both in the US and the entire world, right? For us, it\u2019s \u2026 sort of \u2026 better. For Americans \u2026 what Trump is doing is better for them. Kolya: Well, we have lots of those American experts here now \u2026 [indiscernible.] Sytnyk: Well, there, you see why Hillary lost the elections? I was in charge of the investigation of their \u201cblack accounting\u201d records. We made the Manafort\u2019s data available to general public. Kolya: So what? Sytnyk: He was imprisoned. Manafort then was the head of the Supreme Headquarter of Trump, right? Then he was dismissed, too, including due to the \u201cblack accounting.\u201d After that, he was sentenced to 80 years of imprisonment term. How about Trump? Did he not give a s***. They have their system working there and it works smoothly. Kolya: Everybody worked smoothly there. Sytnyk: And when they carried out the elections, a week before the elections, the FBI reopened the investigation in respect of Hillary. So her rating dropped for 7 percent and that\u2019s why Trump managed to win the elections at a pinch.\n\nI\u2019m still unable to understand why he\u2019s fighting with the FBI. They try to catch him on the hand. If it were not the FBI, he would not have won the elections. They torpedoed Hillary\u2019s ratings for 7 percent.\n\nGlenn says, \u201cSo here he is. He is admitting to tampering with our elections. Admitted working with the Hillary Clinton campaign. He is actually convicted in the highest court in the land in Ukraine. This is all front page news, in Ukraine, while we are saying, \u2018Was there anyone tampering with the election?'\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the podcast, Glenn reads an email written by Alexandra Chalupa , a Ukrainian-American lawyer and DNC contractor, sent to Louise Miranda at the DNC. Chalupa had been working feverishly to bring down Paul Manafort in 2016. This email is not new. Dan Bongino wrote about it in his book, \u201cSpygate,\u201d which was published last fall. I have posted about it. Chalupa writes:\n\nHey, a lot coming down the pipe. I spoke to a delegation of 68 investigative journalists from Ukraine last night at the Library of Congress, the Open World Society forum. They put me on the program to speak specifically about Paul Manafort. I invited Michael Isikoff, who I\u2019ve been working with for the past few weeks, and connected him to the Ukrainians. More offline tomorrow, since there was a big Trump component you and Lauren need to be aware of that will hit in the next few weeks. Something I\u2019m working on that you should be aware of.\n\nNote: Glenn tells an interesting story about the day Manafort was arrested. He said on that very day, Clinton pal Tony Podesta shut down his lobbying firm which was one of the largest in Washington and had been operating for 30 years. He says: \u201cThis is why Tony Podesta shut down the Podesta Group, like on the day that Paul Manafort was arrested. Okay? As soon as they arrested him, the biggest lobbying firm, the Clinton lobbying firm, millions of dollars, [Podesta] walks into the office in one day, and says, \u2018close the doors.\u2019 Not like, \u2018Hey, at the end of the week, or at the end of the month, we\u2019re going to wrap things up,\u2019 [he said ] \u2018Close the doors.\u2019 And he shut his firm down. Well, why? Because he\u2019s working with the same group of people, that Manafort [was.]\u201d", "description": "Smoking Gun?
