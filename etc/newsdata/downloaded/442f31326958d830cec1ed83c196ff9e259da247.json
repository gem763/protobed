Chinese exports toward the US tanked 16%. Chinese officials took additional stimulus measures as data started looking uglier. In addition to 50-basis-point nationwide RRR cut revealed earlier, the PBoC delivered 100-basis-point targeted cut for regional banks. The PBoC\u2019s determination to fight the economic slowdown encouraged investors to buy stocks on Monday open, but gains remained timid.\n\ngained 0.36%; (+0.39%) and (+0.55%) shyly followed, as growth fell to 1.3% y-o-y in the second quarter, as broadly priced in. US equity futures recorded limited gains as well; the S&P (+0.20%), (+0.19%) and Nasdaq futures (+0.20%) edged marginally higher.\n\nEnergy stocks (-0.24%) traded under pressure in Sydney, while technology stocks outperformed across the board.\n\n(+0.19%) and futures (+0.35%) hint at a positive open in Europe.\n\nThe 100 is expected to challenge the 7300p in early trading.\n\nFed to cut 25bps, ECB to cut 10bps or more.\n\nNegative vibes of the escalating trade war were felt across the Pacific Ocean, as well. Friday\u2019s payrolls data showed that the US economy added 130\u2019000 nonfarm jobs in August, well below the 160\u2019000 expected by the analyst. Though the average earnings rose to 0.4% m-o-m from 0.3% printed a month earlier, as the participation rate improved.\n\nThe yield came off the 1.60% high, but the Fed expectations remained broadly unchanged. Investors expect a 25-basis-point cut at this month\u2019s FOMC meeting, but no more.\n\nDoves will rather be flying over the European Central Bank (ECB) this week. Rising trade tensions, weakening global demand, and Brexit uncertainties have recently taken their toll on the Euro zone\u2019s economy. Hence, the ECB is expected to lower the deposit rate by at least 10 basis points to -0.50% at Thursday\u2019s policy meeting to show better support to the economy.\n\nThe euro will likely remain in bears\u2019 hands into the ECB meeting. The could make another attempt below the 1.10 mark. Investors are broadly hedged against a fall below this level; put options prevail at 1.1000/1.1050 at this week\u2019s expiries.\n\nThe is preparing to test the 100-day moving average (0.8928) against the pound.\n\ngains as Tories fall apart under Johnson\u2019s leadership, but data could hammer short-term gains.\n\nIn the UK, Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit threat eases as Tories fall apart. Despite numerous Tory resignations and three consecutive defeats last week, Johnson should continue pushing for a general election before the October 31st deadline, but his chances of convincing the British MPs to throw a snap election before the end of October, or to get them to agree on a no-deal Brexit decrease by the day.\n\nJohnson\u2019s defeats push the pound higher. The latest CFTC data confirmed that investors trimmed net short speculative positions in sterling in the week ending September 3rd for the fourth straight week. At this point, there is an increased likelihood of a delayed Brexit deadline, followed by a general election and a possible defeat of the Conservative Party, even if the hard Brexiteers came together under the same roof to get the Brexit done as soon as possible.\n\nThough Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party has never been investor\u2019s darling, it now carries the hope of a softer Brexit which is a better outcome for the market. Hence Tories\u2019 falling popularity under Boris Johnson\u2019s rule should remain encouraging for the pound sterling even with the looming political uncertainties. All scenarios are better than a no-deal Brexit on October 31st.\n\nBut the deteriorating economic data could get on the way of sterling\u2019s short-term recovery. Due today, the data should confirm a further contraction in the UK\u2019s industrial and manufacturing production in July, and the trade deficit may have widened over the same month. Key support to the recent pound recovery stands at 1.2200 against the US dollar, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement. This level should distinguish between the consolidation of the short-term positive trend and another wave of sterling sell-off.\n\nIn the medium run, Cable has the potential to recover toward the 1.25 mark, if British MPs continue fighting against a no-deal Brexit.\n\nGold and oil\n\nremains bid near the $1500 an ounce despite the actual risk-on trades. The precious metal has become a powerful hedging tool and a good alternative to developed economies\u2019 extremely low yielding sovereign bonds.\n\nGold is, and will likely stay, where investors want to be during a time of rising global uncertainties, dovish central bank expectations, and falling sovereign yields. Key support could be found at $1490, minor 23.6% retracement on May \u2013 September rise.\n\nElsewhere, Saudi Arabia replaced its Energy Minister with one of King Salman\u2019s sons on rising frustration over falling oil prices. Oil markets gave a limited reaction to changes in Saudi, as the new minister has not many choices but to maintain a low production regime in place to match the slowing global demand amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China. OPEC and its allies will meet in Abu Dhabi on September 12th to review their strategy. There is not much the allies could do to boost the fading market prices other than considering more production cuts.\n\ncrude trades around its 200-day moving average of $56 a barrel, while tests $62 level with limited conviction on the topside.\n\nOpening calls\n\nto open 25 points higher at 7307\n\nto open 20 points higher at 12212\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
