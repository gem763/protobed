(Oct. 21) AP, AP\n\nLONDON \u2013 With just nine days to go before Britain's scheduled departure date from the European Union, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will ask lawmakers Tuesday to support the Brexit withdrawal deal he struck with the bloc's leaders last week and to push the agreement through Parliament before a Halloween deadline.\n\nJohnson has staked his premiership on ensuring Britain leaves the EU by Oct. 31. He has also twice failed to force a \"straight up-and-down vote\" in Parliament on the deal he negotiated with the 27 other EU nations laying out the terms of Britain\u2019s exit.\n\nLawmakers want more time to scrutinize the agreement and to make sure that even if they do back Johnson's exit deal, Britain doesn't accidentally crash out of the EU \u2013 a risky \"no-deal\" Brexit \u2013 before the necessary legislation is in place to implement it.\n\nBrexit: Boris Johnson denied new Brexit after weekend Parliament snub\n\nJohnson's Conservative government published the 115-page Withdrawal Agreement Bill late Monday. On Tuesday, Parliament is expected to first vote on whether Johnson commands enough support from lawmakers to approve the deal in principle and then whether they feel there is sufficient time to turn it into law by Oct. 31.\n\nThe BBC reported that Johnson may have sufficient backing for the first vote.\n\nHowever, it also reported that if lawmakers subsequently reject Johnson's timeframe then his government may \"pull\" the bill from consideration and Parliament and could push for a general election, possibly before Christmas.\n\nThe impact on Brexit's fate under that scenario is not clear.\n\nThe vote is expected around 7 p.m. London time (2 p.m. ET\n\nPassing a bill usually takes weeks or even months and Johnson needs a majority in Parliament to pass it, but his party holds just 288 of the 650 House of Common seats.\n\nJohnson has referred to his Brexit deadline as \"do or die.\"\n\n\"If this House backs this legislation, if we ratify this new deal ... we can get Brexit done and move our country on,\" Johnson said in the House of Commons on Tuesday. \"We can turn the page and allow this Parliament and this country to begin to heal and unite.\"\n\nIf lawmakers approve the broad outlines of Johnson's deal, and the timetable for making it legislation, they will spend the next two days debating and voting on possible amendments. Among those up for discussion is whether final passage of the deal should be tied to a new national referendum on whether Brexit should even happen.\n\nThe prime minister is still waiting to hear whether the EU will grant a Brexit extension that he was legally forced to request, even though he opposed doing so, after opposition and rebel lawmakers on Saturday stymied an earlier Brexit vote.\n\nIn one illustration of how quickly lawmakers are being asked to analyze Johnson's deal, Caroline Lucas, a Green Party politician, noted on Twitter that lawmakers \"had more time to debate the Wild Animals in Circuses Act (affecting 19 animals) than they will to decide the future of 65 million people. It\u2019s hard to think of anything which better illustrates this Govt\u2019s contempt for people, Parliament & democracy.\"\n\n'Bewildering, disastrous': Queen has a Brexit escape plan, but how bad will it be?\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/22/brexit-boris-johnson-parliament-eu-deal-votes/4060528002/", "description": "Boris Johnson will ask lawmakers Tuesday to support\u00a0his Brexit deal and to push the agreement through Parliament before a Halloween deadline.", "authors": ["Kim Hjelmgaard", "Published A.M.
