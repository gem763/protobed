One extreme example is to and from Antalya in Turkey \u2013 serving resorts such as Side and Alanya.\n\nAt this time of year, late-booking fares from Gatwick to the Turkish city should cost \u00a3150-\u00a3200 one-way, buying the day before departure.\n\nThomas Cook Airlines previously had five flights from the London area to Antalya on Wednesdays. But now only Turkish Airlines serves the southern city from Gatwick.\n\nThe one-way fare for Wednesday 25 September is \u00a3786, about four times higher than normal and \u00a3100 more than a return trip to Sydney in Australia.", "description": "The 800,000 Thomas Cook customers now looking for alternative holidays after the travel firm\u2019s collapse have been augmented by thousands more.\u00a0 Europe\u2019s biggest tour operator, Tui, had many holidays that were due to\u00a0use\u00a0Thomas Cook Airlines.
