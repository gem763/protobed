And this year\u2019s house price recovery, partially sparked by cheaper borrowing costs, is \u201cdriving a modest turn in spending plans\u201d as the \u201cnegative wealth effect weighing on the consumer\u201d eases, says CBA chief economist Michael Blythe.\n\nMeanwhile, the RBA\u2019s trimmed mean measure of inflation \u2013 its preferred underlying gauge of consumer price moves \u2013 fell below the bottom of the 2-3 per cent target range at the start of 2016 and has remained there since.\n\nConsumer prices grew by 1.6 per cent over the year to June 30, and data for the September quarter, to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show a slight tick higher to 1.7 per cent, according to Bloomberg's survey of forecasts.\n\nThe trimmed mean should stay steady at 1.6 per cent over the year to September. But, if anything, the risks are that it comes in lower rather than higher. And nobody is talking about a an imminent return of price pressures.\n\n\"We find it hard to envisage core inflation breaking higher any time soon, let alone returning to the mid-point [of the band],'' Westpac economists say.\n\nIndeed, the central bank expects inflation to remain below target until mid-2021, despite the market pricing in another rate cut - to 0.5 per cent - by May next year.\n\nTo get inflation moving again, the Reserve Bank has made it clear it wants the unemployment rate, which sits at 5.2 per cent, to drop to 4.5 per cent. This is the point at which wage pressures should begin to build, reckons the central bank.\n\nUnfortunately, there are other forces at work which are set to frustrate this goal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sharp fall in residential building is leading to labour retrenchment in a construction industry which employs 9 per cent of the national workforce. That is having knock-on effects to employment in other corners of the economy, ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch says.\n\nSo ever easier monetary policy easing appears to have little capacity to lift consumption, business investment, unemployment, or wages. Indeed, it may even have a negative effect.\n\nIf rate cuts can't move the dial on these factors, then monetary policy simply cannot hope to get inflation back within the band for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo why keep cutting? Why publicly contemplate QE? If monetary policy can't push inflation higher, then why not move the target band to 1-2 per cent and cry \"mission accomplished\"?\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but right now might be the worst time to abandon the inflation target.\n\n\u201cShifting the goal posts [of monetary policy] could \u2026 entrench a low inflation mindset,\u201d the RBA governor said in July.\n\nThe Reserve Bank is firmly focused on ensuring expectations do not become so unanchored that individuals and companies begin to expect disinflation or even deflation.\n\nExpecting lower consumer prices is damaging to growth as households postpone spending in anticipation of lower prices. This can lead to a further leg lower in overall economic growth and wages, creating a vicious cycle.\n\nLowe is engaged in a battle for hearts and minds. He needs to keep the flame of the inflation target alive until such time that the structural and cyclical forces depressing consumer prices ease.\n\nIn the twilight of the central banking gods, monetary policy is reduced to shadow boxing.", "description": "In the twilight of the central banking gods, monetary policy is reduced to shadow boxing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_433%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/86e38b8ff8d8ed0d53f678a17af874e9ee59d0b4", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
