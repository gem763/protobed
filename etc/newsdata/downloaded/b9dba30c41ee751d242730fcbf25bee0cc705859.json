They are shown how to train and handle the dogs gently, performing various tricks and exercises.\n\nThe organisation\u2019s founder and chief executive, jackaroo-cum-social-worker Bernie Shakeshaft, says the process is not engineered. \u201cThe right dog will pick the right kid,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cThe ADHD kid will have the ADHD dog\u201d and \u201cthe dog that wants to lay around in the sun all day will be with the chilled-out kid\u201d.\n\nSpeaking over the phone having recently returned to the New South Wales town of Armidale (where the program is based) after helping fight bushfires, Shakeshaft elaborates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you see that \u2013 the dogs selecting kids in that way,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of the dogs are also really good at dealing with trauma. They just know how to pick the right kid out on the right day. It\u2019s great to watch this happen in front of you.\u201d\n\nBackTrack, which was founded in 2006, has three core goals: \u201ckeeping kids alive, out of jail, and chasing their hopes and dreams\u201d. Despite receiving little government funding, it has a reported 87% success rate in giving participants (most of whom are Indigenous) either full-time employment or training and education. The initiative has received many accolades, including winning the NSW Youth Service of the Year award in 2015 and in 2018.\n\nFor the film, Scott followed participants for more than two years and became \u201cpart of the family\u201d, says Shakeshaft.\n\nScott says it was \u201cno accident\u201d that she was drawn to the subject. \u201cI have a very personal thematic connection, with two little boys, one of whom has ADHD. I struggle to manage them sometimes. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\nOne of the featured boys is Russell, aka Rusty. Twelve years old at the time of initial filming, he explains on screen that things started to go wrong for him around the age of nine: \u201cI started sneakin\u2019 out at night, running around the streets, getting picked up by the coppers every night.\u201d\n\nDogs mirror stress levels of owners, researchers find Read more\n\nScott decided to make his journey a key focus.\n\n\u201cRusty really changes a lot over the progress of the film. He is the funniest kid and we really connected. In just three months I could already see so much change ... but it\u2019s never a straight line, these stories. The boys come in, do something bad and fall off.\n\n\u201cBernie has a wonderful saying: that you\u2019ve got to look for the gold in these kids. You\u2019ve got to look for the good things behind the bad behaviour, because you can always find it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Being paired with a great dane helped settle Rusty, right, who is now employed by BackTrack. Photograph: Catherine Scott\n\nWhen Rusty arrived at BackTrack, he and a great dane connected. It was a perfect match, says Shakeshaft. \u201c[Rusty] came in as a big, tough, mouthy kid, thinking, \u2018I\u2019ll get my own way by being physically violent and loud and boisterous.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut with a great dane, well, go and push this dog around like you think you can push other people around. He soon worked out that being aggressive with a great dane was not a good way to get it to work alongside him.\u201d\n\nRusty is now employed by BackTrack, undertaking a school-based traineeship in agriculture.\n\n\u201cIs the job finished? Absolutely not,\u201d says Shakeshaft, \u201cbut who else would employ him? He\u2019s still got his issues to go through. It\u2019s not a timed program. We don\u2019t kick people out and get another kid. You cannot get kicked out of BackTrack, full stop. We keep going until the job\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nShakeshaft\u2019s approach is described in the film as \u201cunconventional\u201d; the social worker believes this word is used because \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do stupid stuff that other organisations get bogged down in, such as paperwork that says what you can and can\u2019t do.\n\n\u201cYou see in the film how many times we give a kid a hug, for example. In many other organisations I\u2019ve worked for, you\u2019d be sacked for doing that. So for some people who are looking from the outside in, they think: that\u2019s very unconventional. I say no, that\u2019s just being a human. Ticking boxes is not changing kids\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\n\u2022 BackTrack Boys airs on SBS on Sunday at 8.30pm\n\n\n\n", "description": "The \u2018unconventional\u2019 BackTrack youth program has received little funding, but achieved big results \u2013 thanks in part to the canines at its core", "authors": ["Luke Buckmaster"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae125b9a2baa6bfa42f170743592a9eb444a30cf/0_151_2598_1559/master/2598.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7c834916c710cdb23d98525c2c4dc0a", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
