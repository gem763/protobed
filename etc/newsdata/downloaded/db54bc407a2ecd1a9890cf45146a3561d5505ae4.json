'It has most definitely been good to get away as I think your body needs a break but your mind needs it more than anything.\n\n'This summer has taught me how hard international cricket is. It was a bit of a step up with England for the first few months for me. Playing at this level is demanding and taxing on the body. I think the key is managing your body and time as well.'\n\nNext up for the fast bowler is England's upcoming tour of New Zealand in November and December. Archer has been selected for both the five-game one-day international series as well as the two-Test encounter that follows.\n\nAnd looking ahead to his first tour as an England player, he says that confidence within the squad is high after their fantastic summer.\n\nArcher says the England squad's confidence is high after their success in both formats\n\n'I haven't been around the boys but I can tell you that the last game of the summer that we had [at the Oval] we won and everyone was in a really good mood.\n\n'This is probably one of the better teams I've ever played in so everyone will be in good stead for New Zealand.'\n\nAn avid-gamer Archer has confirmed that he will be taking his Xbox One and the popular game Fortnite with him for the trip. And the man who appeared to have his own cheat code during the Cricket World Cup, taking 20 wickets during the tournament, says winning that has still not sunk in \u2013 especially the manner it came in via a super over against New Zealand at Lord's.\n\n'It's not until I go into the living room and see my medal and then I think 'yeah I helped achieve that'. I still can't believe that we've won it and the margin of how we won it by as well.'\n\nArcher was speaking to Sportsmail at the launch of The Hundred where the eight franchise teams were unveiled in east London.\n\nArcher will be representing the Southern Brave in The Hundred which launches next summer\n\nThe Sussex quick was selected for his local franchise the Southern Brave \u2013 who will play their cricket at The Ageas Bowl in Southampton.\n\nWhile his home matches won't be in Hove, like he is used to with Sussex, Archer is happy to be within the realms of home comforts in what will be a new format to him and the sport.\n\n'It feels good to be representing a team so close to home as if I do have a few days off I'll be sure to go there.\n\n'I'm not going in there with any expectations [about the format] as I'm going in with an open mind. This is a new format and you never know where it could go, it could be the next best thing.\n\n'I think I'll go in to it with the same approach as I do have with the T20. I'll try and adapt to it in case anything needs changing.'\n\nThe fast bowler believes The Hundred will prove a hit as it looks to entice a new audience\n\nThe five-week competition will be played at the height of summer, starting July 2020, featuring eight new city-based teams from Manchester, Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham, Cardiff, Southampton and two in London (Lord's and the Oval).\n\nThe Hundred has received criticism from some cricket traditionalists with its 10-ball over format aimed to entice a completely new audience. However, Archer believes the format will prove a hit \u2013 with the England squad already excited about the prospect of going up against each other.\n\n'I think it will do straight away,' he said when asked if he believes The Hundred could be a success.\n\n'Obviously everyone wants to know about the new format, who are the players and where are they playing so I think we should attract some interest straight away. As long as the tournament goes well it should attract more people.\n\n'There's banter going around already [around the England camp] as it's probably the only time you're going to be able to play against your friends. In first class or county cricket everyone may not be available so this is the one time that everyone can play against each other.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY LUKE AUGUSTUS: Jofra Archer has welcomed the break from cricket after an intense debut summer with England across the Test and one-day formats.", "authors": ["Luke Augustus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/18/19661500-0-image-a-12_1570987478774.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
