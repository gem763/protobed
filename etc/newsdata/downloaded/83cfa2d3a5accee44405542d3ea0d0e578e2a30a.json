It affirmed Moscow as the arbiter of Syria\u2019s fate and the rising power in the Middle East. It sent another signal to Iran that Washington has no appetite for the kind of confrontation that its rhetoric suggests and that Iran\u2019s expanded influence in Syria is now likely to go unchallenged.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt sent a message to the wider world that the United States is in the process of a disengagement that could resonate beyond the Middle East, said Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that the long goodbye has begun and that the long goodbye from the Middle East could become a long goodbye from Asia and everywhere else,\u201d he said.\n\nImages shared on social media underscored the indignity of the retreat. Departing U.S. troops in sophisticated armored vehicles passed Syrian army soldiers riding in open-top trucks on a desert highway. An embedded Russian journalist took selfies on the abandoned U.S. base in Manbij, where U.S. forces had fought alongside their Kurdish allies to drive out the Islamic State in 2015.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnly yesterday they were here, and now we are here,\u201d said the journalist, panning the camera around the intact infrastructure, including a radio tower and a button-powered traffic-control gate that he showed was still functioning.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how they lived and what they ate,\u201d he said, before ducking into one of the tents and filming the soldiers\u2019 discarded snacks.\n\nOn Arab news channels, coverage switched from footage of jubilant Syrian troops to scenes of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s lavish receptions from the monarchs of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Washington\u2019s most vital Arab allies in the Persian Gulf. The visits had been long planned, but the timing gave them the feel of a victory lap.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis has left a bad taste for all of America\u2019s friends and allies in the region, not only among the Kurds,\u201d said a former regional minister who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to not embarrass his government, an American ally. \u201cMany will now be looking for new friends. The Russians don\u2019t abandon their allies. They fight for them. And so do the Iranians.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was the manner of the withdrawal, hastily called amid chaos on the battlefield as Turkish forces pushed deep into Syria, that gave the event such impact in the region, analysts said. Few had anticipated that the most advanced military in the world would make such a scrambled and hasty departure, even after President Trump signaled he would not endorse a war on behalf of the Kurds against a U.S. NATO ally.\n\nLess than 48 hours before the withdrawal announcement, the top U.S. military commander, Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark A. Milley, had given assurances that the troops would remain indefinitely, standing by their Kurdish partners to continue to hunt down the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nBut the Turks\u2019 capture Sunday of a key highway that served as the U.S. troops\u2019 main supply line revealed the fragility of a mission that had narrowly focused on the Islamic State fight while neglecting regional dynamics, including the depth of Turkish animosity to the Kurdish militia with which the United States had teamed up.\n\nAD\n\nFor many in the region, Trump\u2019s abandonment of Syria caps a long erosion of trust that began under the administration of President Barack Obama. His decision not to stand by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled during the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, is frequently contrasted with Russia\u2019s unwavering support for Assad after he faced popular unrest just a few weeks later, Arab officials say.\n\nObama\u2019s retreat from his \u201cred line\u201d ultimatum on the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, after hundreds died in an attack outside Damascus in 2013, further called into question Washington\u2019s credibility, they say. His nuclear deal with Iran, which eased economic sanctions in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities, was seen by some as a capitulation to Iran and a betrayal of U.S. allies in the Middle East who were not consulted and were more concerned about Iran\u2019s pursuit of ballistic missiles and regional expansionism.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s election to the presidency was welcomed by the United States\u2019 closest allies as a chance to reset the clock, but he, too, has disappointed, with his unpredictability and seemingly erratic decision-making. His decision not to confront Iran after it shot down an American drone in June jolted Gulf Arab leaders, who began to wonder whether decades of U.S. security guarantees could be counted on in the event of a real crisis with Iran.\n\nAD\n\nAmericans cannot complain about any loss of influence in the region as a result of their actions, said Mohammed al-Sulami, writing in the Saudi Arabian Arab News outlet on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWashington actively opted for this policy, having chosen a strategy of withdrawal and retrenchment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe U.S. has no right to condemn the region\u2019s countries if they choose to forge relations with other powers to protect their interests.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe abrupt departure from northeastern Syria, Ibish said, has further shredded any U.S. credibility that had survived the disengagement of the Obama era and the capriciousness of the Trump one. The United States remains overwhelmingly the dominant military power in the Middle East, with around 50,000 troops deployed in the region and a level of technological superiority that will ensure allies covet American weapons and support for years.\n\nAD\n\nBut friends and enemies alike are starting to suspect that Trump\u2019s unpredictability is less a cause than a consequence of a broader American reluctance to engage with the world, Ibish said. He dates that to the trauma of the bloody, costly and ultimately unsatisfying wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cPeople are asking: Could the United States not only be an unreliable power, but could it actually be a weak power as well?\u201d he said. \u201cNot because it lacks the capability but because it lacks the will.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere was therefore a sense of inevitability to the sudden American departure from Syria, analysts said. Washington appears to have underestimated Turkey\u2019s determination to prevent the emergence of a Kurdish statelet on its border and overestimated the limited leverage offered by the presence of 1,000 U.S. troops.\n\nAD\n\nThe small U.S. presence in Syria had big intentions but only limited means. The goal, as articulated by State Department officials, was for the troops to remain there to stamp out the remnants of the Islamic State and to provide leverage in seeking a Syrian peace settlement that would impose restraints on Assad\u2019s power, safeguard Kurdish interests and limit Iran\u2019s influence.\n\nThe Kurds also had overestimated their clout with an American president who frequently asserts his determination to disentangle the United States from Middle East wars, said Hilal Khashan, professor of political science at the American University of Beirut.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Kurds got carried away with their expectations and believed the U.S. would behave differently to all the foreign powers over the past 150 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey discovered that the U.S. was no different.\u201d", "description": "Many in the region are wondering whether the United States is not only an unreliable power but also a weak one, one analyst said.", "authors": ["Liz Sly", "Beirut Bureau Chief", "Covering Lebanon", "Syria", "The Wider Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ojmhslEIljWXz0IPCD4jwNab_AM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RJ6OQ3XQEAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
