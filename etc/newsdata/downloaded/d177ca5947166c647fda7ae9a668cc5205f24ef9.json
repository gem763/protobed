U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the bank was Tehran\u2019s last source of funds.\n\nAsked about the possibility of a military response on Iran, Trump said the United States was always prepared and that a military strike was always a possibility.\n\nIran denies involvement in the attack, which initially halved oil output from Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest petroleum exporter. Responsibility was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen\u2019s four-year-old conflict.\n\nAt Abqaiq, one of the world\u2019s largest oil processing plants, reporters saw a punctured, blackened stabilizer tower that Khalid Buraik, Saudi Aramco vice-president for southern area oil operations, said would have to be replaced.\n\nAs reporters examined a shattered separator dome draped with a red tape labeled \u201cDanger\u201d, Buraik said 15 towers and facilities had been hit at Abqaiq, but it would regain full output capacity by the end of September.\n\nAt Khurais oilfield to the west, which the Saudi defense ministry says was hit by four missiles, Reuters reporters were shown repair work under way, with cranes erected around two burnt-out stabilization columns, which form part of oil-gas separation units, and melted pipes.\n\n\u201cWe are confident we are going back to the full production we were at before the attack (on Khurais) by the end of September,\u201d Fahad Abdulkarim, Aramco\u2019s general manager for the southern area oil operation, told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe are working 24/7...This is a beehive.\u201d\n\nDEBRIS\n\nWorkmen wearing red high visibility jackets and white helmets moved through the site, a large compound the size of several football stadiums containing interconnected structures of piping and towers.\n\nA mound of blackened debris lay on the ground. An executive said the scorched mess once covered much of the surface of the facility but now only a small mound is left.\n\nSome workers sprayed what appeared to be water on the ground. Mobile cranes and water trucks stood near the crumpled, mangled remains of a fire-damaged stabilization tower.\n\nThe Sept. 14 attacks intensified a years-long struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a sometimes violent contest for influence in several flashpoints around the Middle East.\n\nSaudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said on Thursday the attacks were an \u201cextension of the Iranian regime\u2019s hostile and outlawed behavior\u201d.\n\nIran has warned the United States against being dragged into a war in the Middle East and said it would meet any offensive action with a crushing response.\n\nTehran amplified that message on Friday when a senior Revolutionary Guards commander said Iran would respond from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean against any U.S. plots.\n\nView of the damaged site of Saudi Aramco oil facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Hamad l Mohammed\n\n\u201cIf the Americans think of any plots, the Iranian nation will respond from the Mediterranean, to the Red Sea and to the Indian Ocean,\u201d said General Yahya Rahim-Safavi, a senior adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, state news agency IRNA reported.\n\nCOALITION\n\nLebanon\u2019s Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement warned Saudi Arabia against betting on a war against Iran \u201cbecause they will destroy you,\u201d its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said.\n\n\u201cYour house is made of glass and your economy is made of glass. Like the glass cities in the UAE,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had called the attacks an \u201cact of war\u201d but on Thursday he said Trump, who has ordered more sanctions on Iran, wants a peaceful solution to the crisis.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister on Friday questioned Pompeo\u2019s remarks and listed repeated Iranian diplomatic initiatives.\n\n\u201cCoalition for Peaceful Resolution?,\u201d Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter, and listed eight diplomatic initiatives by Iran since 1985, including a peace plan for Yemen in 2015.\n\nHe later said Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates seemed to wish to \u201cfight Iran to the last American\u201d.\n\nOil prices were on track for their biggest weekly jump since January, lifted by rising Middle East tensions after the attack. Brent crude was up more than 7% from last Friday\u2019s close at $64.69 a barrel, U.S. West Texas Intermediate was $58.47.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping told Saudi King Salman in a phone call that China condemned the attack and called on all parties to avoid escalating the situation, Xinhua reported.\n\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\nDespite being a relatively low-profile diplomatic player in the Middle East, China has close economic and energy relations with both Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said groundless accusations against Iran over the attacks were inflaming tensions, Interfax news agency reported.", "description": "Saudi Arabia on Friday took media on a tour of oil facilities damaged by attacks that Washington and Riyadh blame on Iran, showing melted pipes and burnt equipment, as Tehran vowed wide retaliation if heightened tensions boil over into hostilities.", "authors": ["Stephen Kalin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432001624&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1BO", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
