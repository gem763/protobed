She was the favourite, then the enemy, and by the end most of us were left feeling quite sorry for the heartbroken 24-year-old.\n\nBut since the show wrapped this time last month, Abbie has been doing the media rounds, sharing her hot takes on everything from slut-shaming to Rachael and Vakoo\u2019s relationship. So obviously, it was no surprise when she posted this full-blown grape nude on Instagram this afternoon.\n\n\u201cOk I\u2019m nervous AF about posting this due to possible backlash, but nothing will change if we all just shut up right? Yes, sorry you guys, it\u2019s another feminist rant,\u201d she began the lengthy caption.\n\nThroughout the lengthy caption, Abbie likened herself to Ciarran from this season of The Bachelorette and was quick to point out that if the roles were reversed, we wouldn\u2019t all be complimenting her confidence for getting her rig out on national television.\n\nShe references his honesty about his plastic surgery, his willingness to get starkers in front of everyone, as well as his transparency about dancing in bars in his past. Abbie discussed how these were all signs of a confident man. A man we\u2019d want to fall in love with. An immediate front-runner for Angie\u2019s heart.\n\nBut if the tables were turned, she said, the feedback would be wildly different. Abbie proposed a role reversal, asking her audience what would\u2019ve happened if she was the one to be naked, open and honest about her past.\n\n\u201cWhat if I had been on a group date, offered to strip down to nothing and posed nude on National TV? What if in the same week I had shared that I had had plastic surgery and had danced in night clubs?!I can imagine the nation would riot,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019d be accused of being cocky, not confident, attention seeking, not funny, \u201cslutty\u201d (not that that means anything), not cheeky and \u201cfake\u201d, not just comfortable enough to admit to having surgery.\u201d\n\nThe post has been met with some pretty mixed responses, with some fans praising her \u201cfeminist rant\u201d, while others felt like she \u201cneeds to move past [her] Bachie experience.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not wrong in her opinion, and as an avid viewer of the show, it did make me question how I would\u2019ve reacted if the tables were turned. However, it begs the question, is she doing this to hold on to the fame and drama of last season\u2019s Bachie, or is this a cause she\u2019s truly passionate about moving forward?\n\nNow, we\u2019ve all been pretty strong supporters of Abbie from day one, but the show has been over for us for an entire month now, and for her, even longer. I think it\u2019s time we all move on from Matt Agnew\u2019s season of The Bachelor.\n\nIf Abbie wants to use her platform to discuss important issues like feminism, I\u2019m all about it. But for the love of Osher Gunsberg, can we PLEASE stop talking about Matt Agnew\u2019s season already? I\u2019m begging you.", "description": "Former Bachie star Abbie Chatfield has shared a nude photo on Instagram to discuss the important issue of sexism on The Bachelor.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-19-at-10.58.12-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
