(Benjamin C Tankersley/For The Washington Post)\n\nThree models are offered \u2014 Palermo, Capri and Sorrento \u2014 each with many customizable options. \u201cWe\u2019re a semi-custom builder and offer something for everyone,\u201d Lyman said. \u201cWe try to narrow down what people want and give everyone a unique home.\u201d\n\nBuying New: Brookland development has \u2018super sleek and modern\u2019 look\n\nDavis drove by many times and though she wasn\u2019t really looking to buy a new house, when she saw the sign for ranch-style homes, she said, \u201cLet me take a look.\u201d\n\n\u201cErik was in the sales office and welcomed me. He recommended I walk around the Palermo model. But when he said it was a 5,000-square-foot house, I said, \u2018I don\u2019t need that much space and I don\u2019t want stairs,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nHe pointed her to the Capri, a smaller, single-living-level home. She walked in. \u201cI immediately thought this was right for me,\u201d Davis said. She worked out the finances with the lender and signed the contract. That was back in January. Over the next several months she watched the house go up.\n\nCovered deck: Entry into the house is via a small foyer that leads to a spacious open-plan family room adjoining the kitchen and breakfast room. Davis selected an extended covered deck off the breakfast room \u2014 meaning she could eat outside during a light rain. The island is nine feet long, her cabinets are stone-colored and there\u2019s a large corner pantry with lots of shelves.\n\nThe owner\u2019s bedroom and bathroom suite are in the back corner of the house. Davis added a bedroom and bathroom to the basement level.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bigger Palermo model is a two-story-plus basement house. A multi-generation bedroom suite can be added on the first level, and there are four bedrooms upstairs. The master suite door, set at an angle, offers an attractive entry into the spacious room. There are two walk-in closets, an expansive bathroom with three large windows, a soaking tub under the middle window and two sink vanities on opposite walls. The corner shower has three walls of glass and a built-in bench.\n\nBuying New: Blackburn Townhomes has several units for sale, with more on the way\n\nA laundry room offers space for side-by-side appliances, shelves, counters and cabinets.\n\nThe basement spans the house footprint and features a walkout patio. There\u2019s enough room for a family with children, visiting friends and overnight guests.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have no doubt this will be a phenomenal community,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe entrance is so grand \u2014 it\u2019s constructed of red brick and adorned with fountains and landscaping \u2014 no one can miss it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAmenities: A wide swath of woodland frames the northern border of the community. The five-acre Lake Tomochichi offers a pretty water setting. There\u2019ll be a pavilion with picnic tables and outdoor grills, a quarter-mile walking path, two playgrounds (for ages 2 to 5 and 5 to 12), a dog park and multipurpose courts for tennis, basketball and pickle ball.\n\nShopping: Brandywine Crossing off Crain Highway features shops, restaurants and commercial services, including Target, Costco and Xscape Theater.\n\nAD\n\nOutdoor recreation: Patuxent River is east of Brandywine and several parks are situated near it. Patuxent River Park, Kings Landing Park and Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary offer retreats for weekends and holidays. Southeast is Cedarville State Forest with forests, streams for fishing, hiking trails and campsites.\n\nAD\n\nSchools: Brandywine Elementary, Gwynn Park Middle, Gwynn Park High.\n\nTransit: Brandywine lies east of Maryland Route 5/Branch Avenue and west of U.S. Route 301.\n\nVillages of Savannah\n\n6703 Savannah Dr., Brandywine, Md.\n\nThere will be 350 single-family houses when the community is complete in approximately five years.
