Ron Kind (D-Wis.). \u201cMy goodness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome Republicans joined the criticism, defending Vindman and denouncing the attacks on him. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said that he\u2019s confident Vindman is \u201cdoing his best to serve his country\u201d and that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be on board\u201d with efforts to disparage him.\n\nAD\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said it was \u201cshameful\u201d to cast aspersions on the veteran.\n\n\u201cWe need to show that we are better than that as a nation,\u201d Cheney said, according to CNN. \u201cTheir patriotism, their love of country, we\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who have put their lives on the line. It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said, \u201cI don\u2019t at all question his patriotism. I respect his service. He\u2019s a Purple Heart and I think it\u2019d be a mistake to attack his patriotism.\u201d\n\nVindman was among the White House officials who listened in on the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. He was expected to tell House investigators that he worried Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate his political rival would undermine national security.\n\nAD\n\nThe claim that Vindman was acting in Ukraine\u2019s interest appears to have first emerged Monday night on Fox News\u2019s \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d before being repeated on other shows. Host Laura Ingraham and her guests suggested that Vindman was working on behalf of Ukraine rather than the United States \u2014 and implied that he might be a spy.\n\nAD\n\nCiting a New York Times report that said Ukrainian officials \u201csought advice\u201d from Vindman on how to deal with Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Fox News host asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d\n\nOne of her panelists, former Justice Department official John Yoo, responded, \u201cI find that astounding, and some people might call that espionage.\u201d\n\nThe backlash was swift.\n\nMichael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, called Yoo\u2019s comments \u201cjust shameful\u201d on Twitter, adding, \u201cIn some countries, that would be a crime called libel.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nConservative columnist David French shared a clip of the segment on Twitter and wrote, \u201cThe sheer number of American vets the Trumpists will insult, slander, and mock for the sake of their corrupt, draft-dodging dear leader is just astonishing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis is astonishing.

On \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d host Brian Kilmeade noted Vindman\u2019s military service but then added, \u201cWe also know he was born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family young. He tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nOn CNN, former Republican congressman Sean P. Duffy said, \u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe all have an affinity to our homeland, where we came from.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCNN host John Berman, who appeared incredulous, said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you suggesting that you would put Irish defense over U.S. defense? Is that what you\u2019re saying, Congressman Duffy?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuffy, who is of Irish descent, didn\u2019t answer that question but said, \u201cHe has an affinity, I think, for the Ukraine. He speaks Ukrainian, he came from the country, and he wants to make sure they\u2019re safe and free. I understand that.\u201d\n\nSean Duffy on CNN on Army Lt. Col. Vindman: \"It seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don't know that he's concerned about American policy ... we all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from ... he has an affinity for the Ukraine.\" pic.twitter.com/dlsYlTnCwR \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 29, 2019\n\nSome of the sharpest criticism of Duffy\u2019s words came from within the network that now employs him as a contributor. CNN anchor Brianna Keilar aired his comments in a segment on her show, calling them a sign of desperation on the part of Trump defenders.\n\n\u201cThat is some anti-immigrant bigotry,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s an odd questioning of patriotism coming from Sean Duffy, the guy who spent part of his 20s on MTV\u2019s \u2018The Real World\u2019 and \u2018Real World Road Rules Challenge\u2019 while Alexander Vindman spent his on foreign deployments.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCNN's Brianna Keilar absolutely scorches her new colleague Sean Duffy:\n\n\n\n\"That's some anti-immigrant bigotry and it\u2019s odd questioning of patriotism coming from a guy who spent his 20s on MTV's The Real World and the Real World/Road Rules Challenge\" while Vindman served in Iraq pic.twitter.com/dCF7cQ6zgM \u2014 Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) October 29, 2019\n\nIn his prepared statement, which was first reported by the New York Times, Vindman emphasized his commitment to the United States, writing that he has dedicated his entire professional life to the country. He noted his Ukrainian roots, saying that after fleeing the Soviet Union, \u201cmy family worked to build its own American Dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a patriot,\u201d Vindman wrote, \u201cand it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The line of attack on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d and beyond quickly drew condemnation.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter", "Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/456Mfn1qi-N1uMk0YG0QG6rbwm0=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-29-2019/t_d946ff2cfe5346ac8f6a2264b0e56f58_name_20191029_FOX_UKRAINE_V1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
