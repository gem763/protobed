HIPAA has a grey zone for patient portals", "language": "en", "text": "Some of you have even taken the reporting into your own hands, diving into dense privacy policies and data feeds to report to me what you find. You\u2019ve inspired my investigations and columns for months to come.\n\nAD\n\nThis feels like the beginning of a movement. So I wanted to share a few recent queries that show how we can demand more transparency from the technology in our lives. It\u2019s our data, after all.\n\nAD\n\nHow private is your health data on \u201cpatient portal\u201d websites used by hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices?\n\nIt\u2019s not as private as you might hope, despite a federal law known as HIPAA, short for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n\nA reader from Silver Spring, Md., who asked me not to use her name, emailed me after reading the privacy policy in an external website used by her doctors at George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates. The patient portal FollowMyHealth.com reserves rights to use \u201cpersonal health record\u201d data for \u201cmarketing and advertising purposes, including sending you marketing and advertising communications whether on our behalf or on behalf of marketing partners.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSay what? Nobody wants to see their medical diagnosis turn into an ad.\n\nThe eagle-eyed reader also noted that when she logged in to Follow My Health, she couldn\u2019t find any privacy or data-sharing controls. \u201cThe only way to prevent the use of my data for marketing appears to be canceling/deleting my account,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s the law here? A patient portal that has a business associate agreement with your doctor\u2019s office to collect your personal health information should be covered by HIPAA, said Deven McGraw, the former deputy director of health information privacy at the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. And under HIPAA, showing paid, targeted advertisements should require consent from each patient.\n\nAD\n\nWhen I contacted Follow My Health\u2019s corporate parent Allscripts, it painted a narrower picture of its practices \u2014 and claimed the site wasn\u2019t limited by HIPAA.\n\nTom Lynch, the company\u2019s director of marketing communications, said the site is \u201cnot disclosing identifiable patient data to third parties for any marketing purpose\u201d \u2014 even though its privacy policy specifically reserves the right to \u201crelease\u201d personal health data for marketing and advertising. (That policy was updated in August.)\n\nAD\n\nLynch said Follow My Health is using \u201cinformation about patients to alert them to certain goods and services that could support their ability to make more informed choices about their own care.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAll of that happens inside the Follow My Health website. \u201cWe have discussed the possibility of alerting patients to information about medical research opportunities, clinical trials or insurance plans that could be relevant,\u201d he said.\n\nBut here\u2019s the head scratcher: Follow My Health claims it is not limited by HIPAA. \u201cUnlike a patient portal that a vendor hosts or supports for a single health-care provider, a vendor of a personal health record product that allows individual consumers to aggregate their health information from multiple sources is not regulated by HIPAA,\u201d said Lynch.\n\nThe HIPAA-covered business associate relationship, he said, is \u201climited to the technical work that is necessary to establish and maintain connectivity\u201d between a doctor\u2019s electronic records system and Follow My Health.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGW Medical didn\u2019t respond to my questions about its business relationship with Follow My Health.\n\nThis case speaks to a broader problem with HIPAA, said Sharon A. Anolik, president of the consulting firm Privacy Panacea. \u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that all health information is protected by HIPAA; it\u2019s just not true,\u201d she says. A growing number of apps and websites skirt oversight, such as wearable devices that track your heart rate, or an app or portal where individuals can store their own health information.\n\nIf a company isn\u2019t covered by HIPAA, it \u201ccan do more with your health information than you might think, without your consent,\u201d she said.\n\nThe takeaway: Yes, you should be suspicious of health portals, even if your doctor uses them. And we should demand doctors be more careful about who they do business with.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Post reader who alerted me to Follow My Health may have ushered along an improvement. Lynch said that by the end of the year, the site will give account holders the ability to \u201copt out\u201d from marketing.\n\nDoes using Apple Pay keep your purchases more private?\n\n\u201cApple Pay is convenient, but does it protect my privacy?\u201d asked Jack Miller from Arlington, Mass. The short answer is it does not hide you from retailers and point-of-sale systems that track purchases.\n\nUsing Apple Pay does create a special new version of your credit card number, which is good for security. You won\u2019t have to run out and get a new credit card if a merchant gets hacked and a criminal tries making a purchase with that stolen number.\n\nBut Apple Pay doesn\u2019t change your card number each time you make a purchase in a store. So a retailer could still use your Apple Pay number as a way to identify you and track you across visits. That\u2019s why, for example, Square terminals at coffee shops and food trucks are still able to text receipts to your previously submitted phone number.\n\nCan I see how websites are tracking me?\n\nA few months ago, I wrote about a Web experiment where I used software to tally up all the tracking cookies I received in a week of normal browsing. It was an astounding 11,189. Several readers asked me how they could track the trackers, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow there\u2019s an easy way to repeat my experiment for yourself. You just have to be using the Mozilla Firefox browser, which I recommend anyway over Google\u2019s Chrome for its superior default privacy settings.\n\nStarting with Version 70 of Firefox, released Tuesday, there\u2019s a weekly status report tallying the times the browser\u2019s \u201cenhanced tracking protection\u201d has blocked third-party cookies and social media trackers. You\u2019ll find it under \u201cshow report\u201d when you tap the shield icon next to the Web address.\n\nI\u2019ve been running a beta version of the new Firefox software for the past week, and tallied 10,788 trackers. Now if only it would also name and shame the sites guilty of doing the most tracking.\n\nRead more from our Secret Life of Your Data series:\n\nAD", "description": "Our tech columnist helps identify a HIPAA loophole, explains ApplePay and shares a Firefox upgrade that helps you track the data trackers on your computer.", "authors": ["Geoffrey A.
