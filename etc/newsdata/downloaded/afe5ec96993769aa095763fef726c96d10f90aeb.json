Furthermore, the whistle-blower complaint raises very troubling questions about how administration lawyers and officials handled the call memo. What the whistle-blower describes is, in my experience, highly unusual and cause for concern\u2026\n\nThe memcon can be edited at any point along the production and review process until it is approved and sent to the Security Council records office. During the Obama administration, edits to memcon packages produced by the Security Council policy staffs were not substantive. The editorial review process was not used to remove unflattering or incorrect things about the president, but troubling reports like the whistle-blower complaint suggest that practice may have changed in the Trump administration. The memcon released to the public last week might not be the only, or the most complete, White House record of the presidential conversation in question at the heart of the current controversy\u2026\n\nThe whistle-blower\u2019s allegation that the draft memcon was \u201clocked down\u201d at the direction of \u201cWhite House lawyers\u201d using a separate electronic system dedicated to processing the most sensitive national security materials also strikes me as highly unusual. Although presidential memcons are among the most sensitive and closely held documents in the White House (their contents are very desirable foreign intelligence targets), in the Obama administration it was standard practice for memcons \u2014 even extremely sensitive ones \u2014 to be produced and handled on the Security Council\u2019s primary electronic system, which can handle material up to and including \u201ctop secret\u201d classification.\n\nIt is also capable of strictly limiting access to a particular memcon to individuals only with a specific need to see and edit it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alex Pascal", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Whistleblower-Memo.Html"], "top_image": ""}
