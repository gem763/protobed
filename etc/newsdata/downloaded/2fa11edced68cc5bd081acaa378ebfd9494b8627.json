We've got nothing to lose,\u201d said Sayyed, 32 and unemployed.\n\n\"This is the land of oil and other blessings. Drill three meters down right here and you\u2019ll strike oil -- but here we are starving,\" he added.\n\nThe protests are unusual because of their apparent spontaneity and independence in a country where rallies are typically called by politicians or religious figures.\n\nDemonstrators are protesting against corruption, unemployment and poor public services.\n\n\"What is a man supposed to do if he has kids and has to pay rent? I don't know what my future is. I have no job, no house and I don't know how I'm supposed to feed my children,\" said Sayyed.\n\n\"We want fundamental change. Otherwise, I won't leave the street -- even if I die.\"\n\nClashes with security forces have left 44 people dead, including six police officers, according to government sources.\n\nOfficials have blamed the violence on \"infiltrators\" and \"non-peaceful aggressors.\"\n\nIn his first public address since the protests began, the embattled premier made a televised speech which aired at 2:00 am Friday as heavy gunfire rang out across Baghdad.\n\nBut his comments failed to appease the protesters.\n\n- 'No one cares' -\n\n\"Even the drunkards were asleep,\" at that time of day, scoffed one protester when asked what he thought of Abdel Mahdi's speech.\n\nAnother demonstrator, a checkered scarf wrapped around his face, said he has been protesting for the past three days.\n\n\"No one cares. Proof is they are shooting at us in the squares,\" he said, declining to give his name.\n\nGrand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, who is revered among Iraq's Shiite majority, on Friday endorsed the protests, and warned they could intensify unless the government takes \"clear and immediate steps.... before it's too late\".\n\nHis words prompted celebratory gunfire from protesters, but Sayyed is not pleased.\n\n\"With all due respect, the Shiite authority has done nothing for us,\" he said.\n\nSayyed said he took up arms in 2014 at the call of Sistani to beef up Iraqi forces and fight the Islamic State group \"but today (he) abandoned us).\n\nSince Tuesday the protests have grown increasingly chaotic and tensions have been exacerbated by an internet blackout as authorities seek to prevent protesters from communication with each other.\n\nAmbulances and paramedics are scarce.\n\nProtesters are resorting to tuk-tuks to transport the wounded to hospitals.\n\nTuk-tuk driver Ali Abdulridha, 20, said he ferries demonstrators to protest sites and as the day unfolds carries those injured to hospitals from 6:00 am until 8:00 pm\n\n\"We do this for free and don't consider it a job. We do it for our country,\" he said.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) - \"We're not infiltrators\", Sayyed said over and over again as he marched Friday to Baghdad's iconic Tahrir Square after Iraqi officials accused \"aggressors\" of being behind four days of anti-government protests.
