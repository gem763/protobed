It\u2019s a question of the future relationship.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the EU cracked the Withdrawal Agreement open, and heavily rewrote the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which all of the stakeholders agree was the single most instrumental step in reaching a deal.\n\nThose revisions, along with additional changes to the Political Declaration on the future relationship, now allow the U.K. prime minister to tell MPs he is presenting them with a divorce decree that is fundamentally different from the one put forward by May that they rejected three times.\n\nOverall, most of the roughly 600-page withdrawal treaty \u2014 on crucial issues like citizens\u2019 rights and the financial settlement \u2014 remains the same. Still, EU backtracking, while perhaps inevitable given Brussels was facing a new negotiating team with a demand for a new deal, proved crucial.\n\nCustoms\n\nEU officials and diplomats have long insisted the bloc's single market must be protected with strong external border checks on goods and food safety. And they argued that for the sake of guaranteeing such \"gate-keeping\" controls, those checks could never be outsourced to a third country.\n\nYet with the new Brexit deal that is exactly what happens: It is U.K. authorities who will check goods going from British ports to Northern Ireland and from thereon potentially into the EU single market. It is British customs officers who'll have to decide whether goods need to pay EU tariffs or not (because it can be supposedly assured they will not continue in the EU.) And British vets will do the critical animal welfare and food safety checks at the border too, ensuring that no sick cow or rotten beef enters EU territory.\n\nAsked by reporters why the EU had crossed its own red line on customs, Barnier offered this excuse: \"A unique situation must be dealt with using exceptional solutions.\"\n\nThat amounts to a significant move on the EU's part: Even last week, Barnier stressed the importance of \"serious and rigorous customs and regulatory checks at every border of our single market and customs union.\" He added: \"It is the credibility of the single market that is in question, and therefore its credibility vis-\u00e0-vis consumers, businesses and third countries with whom we have agreements.\"\n\nEU diplomats were even more specific, saying the bloc could not allow U.K. authorities to run such checks \u2014 especially when London is flirting with deregulating things like genetically modified food in preparation for a future trade deal with the United States.\n\nOne diplomat recalled two weeks ago that it was British authorities who had failed to get a grip on mad cow disease in 1996 and foot-and-mouth in 2001, which then spread to Ireland and the rest of the EU. British customs also faced major embarrassment over a giant Chinese fraud network which led to a \u20ac2.7 billion fine by the EU's anti-fraud office.\n\nBernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's trade committee, openly questioned Thursday whether British authorities would have \"sufficient resources and will\" to properly vet products going into the EU.\n\nAsked by reporters why the EU had crossed its own red line on customs, Barnier offered this excuse: \"A unique situation must be dealt with using exceptional solutions.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland backstop\n\nThe backstop, the insurance mechanism intended to prevent the recreation of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, had been one of most contentious points in the Brexit process. It was roundly rejected by Brexiteers, who saw it as an attack on U.K. sovereignty because (in its original formulation) it would have required Northern Ireland alone to remain in the EU's single market and customs union.\n\nOpposition to the backstop was so fierce that EU negotiators shifted stance and granted May\u2019s request for a U.K.-wide backstop plan. From that point on, they said the backstop was sacrosanct and could not possibly replaced.\n\nUntil it was.\n\nFor months after Johnson insisted the backstop would have to go, EU leaders insisted there was no workable alternative. When the U.K. pushed for a time limit on the backstop, the EU27, led by Ireland, said that was impossible.\n\nThey insisted it needed to be an \u201call-weather\u201d backstop insurance, iron-clad and unchangeable, unless and until it was superseded by a future free-trade agreement. In the end, it turned out there was enough chocolate in Belgium to make a very special type of fudge.\n\nJohnson proposed a mechanism to give the Northern Ireland institutions a say over it to make it more democratic \u2014 effectively granting the joint executive at Stormont veto power. The EU objected to the veto, but gave in on the idea of the consent mechanism.\n\nThe solution was to shift from a time limit to what officials now call an \u201cevent limit\u201d \u2014 meaning a simple majority of the Northern Irish Assembly can vote to abandon the new, special customs arrangement after four years. It\u2019s not a veto, but it is consent, and it allows Johnson to boast that he demolished the \u201cundemocratic\u201d backstop and gave the people of Northern Ireland a say over their own fate.\n\nFor their part, some in the EU are warming to the new backstop replacement. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier than a time limit,\u201d one EU diplomat said, \u201cbecause we can talk to people and convince them.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO Pro\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
