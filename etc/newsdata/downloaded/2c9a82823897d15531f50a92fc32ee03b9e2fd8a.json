The Rossoneri slumped to a fourth loss in six matches and had Mateo Musacchio sent off for a nasty lunge on Franck Rib\u00e9ry.\n\nThe defeat will leave a huge question mark over the future of their manager, Marco Giampaolo, with reports in Italy claiming he would be sacked were they to lose on Sunday night. Giampaolo said: \u201cI believe in my ideas but this Milan team looked like it turned up without ever having a training session together.It played badly on an individual level, with no organisation or sense of collective responsibility.\n\n\u201cThere are some players who are young and can try individual moves but they can only get you so far. When things aren\u2019t going well, you must have the strength to cling to your identity as a team.\u201d\n\nUpwardly mobile Leicester dismantle 10-man Newcastle to go third Read more\n\nGoals from Erick Pulgar, Gaetano Castrovilli and Ribery did the damage for Fiorentina, who also missed a penalty through Federico Chiesa, with Rafael Le\u00e3o pulling one back.\n\nNapoli survived a second-half comeback from a Mario Balotelli-inspired Brescia to win 2-1. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s side led through strikes from Dries Mertens and Kostas Manolas before Balotelli pulled one back with his first Brescia goal.\n\nLazio ran riot against Genoa with goals from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Stefan Radu, Felipe Caicedo and Ciro Immobile wrapping up a 4-0 victory.\n\nEdin Dzeko\u2019s header from Henrikh Mkhitaryan\u2019s cross secured a 1-0 win for Roma at Lecce, whose goalkeeper, Gabriel, saved a penalty from Aleksandar Kolarov, but Lecce could not find an equaliser, with the Manchester United loanee Chris Smalling impressing in the visiting defence.\n\nIn Spain Sevilla battled back from behind to secure a 3-2 win in a thrilling match against Real Sociedad. A fourth-minute Mikel Oyarzabal strike put the visitors ahead, but the lead lasted less than 15 minutes before Nolito hit the equaliser for Sevilla.\n\nIn the second half Sevilla looked to dominate and established a two-goal lead with goals from Lucas Ocampos and Franco V\u00e1zquez. Portu halved the deficit three minutes from time to bring Sociedad back into the game, although they were unable to find the equaliser.\n\nThe result saw Sevilla climb up to sixth, having lost their previous two games. Alav\u00e9s moved further away from trouble at the bottom of the table thanks to a second-half penalty from the former Arsenal forward Lucas P\u00e9rez, with Joselu adding a second four minutes from time to make it 2-0 against Mallorca.\n\nIn France Marseille stretched their unbeaten run to seven league games and moved up to fifth in Ligue 1 following a 1-1 draw at home to Rennes. The visitors went ahead in the 19th minute when Hiroki Sakai turned the ball into his own net under pressure from M\u2019Baye Niang.\n\nValentin Rongier volleyed wide for Marseille before the hosts levelled seven minutes after half-time, Duje Caleta-Car heading in Bouna Sarr\u2019s corner.", "description": "Milan lost for the fourth time in six games and finished with 10 men in a 3-1 defeat at home to Fiorentina while Sevilla came from behind to beat Real Sociedad 3-2", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0378e7cdb0e758f51c82238ab4c5db0dfcb1d8ec/0_65_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d7cf7a14660a25502f2b00dcf8e477d", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
