France has for years been one of the main supporters of this reform.\n\nThe European Union has repeatedly said that it will try to move alone with an EU-wide web tax if no deal is struck next year at the OECD, a global club of mostly rich countries.", "description": "The trade war between the United States and China could cut global growth by 0.5 points next year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438837126&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9816S", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
