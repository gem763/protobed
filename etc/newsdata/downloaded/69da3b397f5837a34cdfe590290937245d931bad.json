But all offseason, they insisted that wasn\u2019t the case. Gore took McCoy on as a little brother, and said the now-Chiefs running back is still a \u201ctop dog in this league.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that,\u201d Gore said. \u201cThe guy can still play. . . . I was looking forward to working with him. We\u2019ve both been successful in this league. I was ready for us to go back and forth, to compete. So, it was tough, but I also know the business. I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s in the situation he\u2019s in, going to Kansas City with his old coach who drafted him. They\u2019ve got a good team over there. I hope he does well. Now it\u2019s trying to keep our room tight \u2014 trying to work every day and get better to help this team be successful.\u201d\n\nWithout McCoy, Gore\u2019s going to be asked to carry a heavier load. He\u2019s shown no indication in his career that\u2019s a problem, though the Bills were also impressed by rookie Devin Singletary.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a bright future, as long as he just keeps working and me and T.J. [Yeldon] keep pushing him,\u201d Gore said of Singletary. \u201cI think as a group, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nThey just weren\u2019t expecting to be without McCoy, after the Bills spent so much offseason breath insisting he\u2019d be there.", "description": "Frank Gore was just trying to get a workout in Saturday morning, when people stopped by with jokes.
