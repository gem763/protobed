The dogs that sprinted after him, President Donald Trump said about the Islamic State leader\u2019s death on Sunday, were only deterred by a suicide bomb that detonated inside al-Baghdadi\u2019s vest, killing him and several children.\n\n\u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.\u201d\n\nIn a graphic speech spent comparing al-Baghdadi to a whimpering and suffering animal, Trump celebrated that no American lives had been lost. Not even a four-legged one.\n\n\u201cOur \u2018K-9,\u2019 as they call it,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI call it a dog. A beautiful dog \u2014 a talented dog \u2014 was injured and brought back.\u201d\n\nThe soldiers who helped capture al-Baghdadi will no doubt be the subject of intense public interest going forward \u2014 and, if history holds, so will the dogs they used as their first line of defense. After the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, the identity of the dog who aided a team of Navy SEALs when they pushed into the terrorist leader\u2019s compound, a Belgian Malinois named Cairo, became the subject of rampant curiosity.\n\nOn Sunday, neither the White House nor the Pentagon would respond to request for details about the animals used in the pursuit of al-Baghdadi. But Ron Aiello, a retired Marine and president of the nonprofit U.S. War Dogs Association, said in an interview that the dogs were probably one of two breeds: A German shepherd or a Belgian Malinois, two of the most common breeds deployed during similar military operations because of their strength and ability to sniff out explosives.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re leading the patrol,\u201d Aiello said, \u201cthey want a dog that is not only an explosive detection dog but on command can be aggressive. On a mission like this you want a dog that can be aggressive when necessary.\u201d\n\nAs the nature of terrorist attacks have changed in recent years to target airports, malls and other public places, bomb-sniffing breeds \u2014 a list that also includes Labrador retrievers \u2014 have become a sought-after law enforcement and military tool. Prices can exceed $25,000 per dog, and experts have long warned of a shortage. When they are used for military purposes, dogs like Cairo are often outfitted in their own protective gear, including waterproof vests with night-vision cameras that can be used by handlers to see what their dogs see.\n\nA fully trained military dog can cost upward of $283,000, or as much as a sophisticated piece of weaponry, according to a Bloomberg analysis. But Aiello said that the right breeds were still more effective than humans or bomb-sniffing technology.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t replicate what they can do,\u201d said Aiello, who in 1966 was part of one of the first Marine scout dog teams to be deployed to Vietnam. \u201cThey save lives every day over there leading patrols.\u201d\n\nTrump would not be the first commander in chief to be impressed by the heroic actions of a dog who helped military operatives capture a terrorist leader. A story by The New Yorker published a few months after the bin Laden raid described a fascinated President Barack Obama asking to meet Cairo.\n\n\u201cThere was a dog?\u201d Obama said during a meeting on the bin Laden operation, when he learned that Cairo was nearby. The president, distracted from his briefing, said, \u201cI want to meet that dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to meet the dog, Mr. President,\u201d the squadron commander joked, \u201cI advise you to bring treats.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Obama met Cairo, who stayed muzzled.\n\nTrump on Sunday did not go into detail about the soldiers who carried out the raid. Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, said during an appearance on CNN that U.S. soldiers had been injured during the operation, a statement that conflicted with Trump\u2019s claim that only a dog had been injured.\n\n\u201cWe had two minor casualties, two minor injuries, to our soldiers,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThey\u2019ve already returned to duty.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Trump alternated between his reverence for the dogs used in the raid and using the word \u201cdog\u201d as a slur he has reserved to describe a host of adversaries in subhuman terms.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog,\u201d Trump said of al-Baghdadi. \u201cHe died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The last moments of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's life were spent being chased down a dark underground tunnel by military dogs.
