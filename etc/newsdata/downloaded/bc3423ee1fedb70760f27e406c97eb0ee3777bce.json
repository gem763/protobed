Her teacher allegedly called her \u201cdirty\u201d and expelled her from the classroom in Kabiangek, west of Nairobi.\n\nIt was the girl\u2019s first period, her mother told local media, and she did not have a sanitary pad.\n\nThe incident has cast a spotlight on a 2017 law requiring Kenya\u2019s government to distribute free sanitary pads to all schoolgirls. Poor implementation of the law is the subject of a parliamentary investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, female MPs \u201claid siege\u201d to the education ministry to protest about the girl\u2019s death and discuss the programme, MP Esther Passaris wrote on Twitter.\n\nMore than 200 parents also protested outside the school in Kabiangek this week, local media reported, condemning both the teacher\u2019s handling of the incident and alleged lack of action by authorities. Alex Shikondi, the regional police chief, said the girl\u2019s death was under investigation.\n\nPolice used tear gas to disperse the protesters and arrested at least five people after they pulled down the school\u2019s gate, according to Kenya\u2019s Daily Nation newspaper. The school has been temporarily closed.\n\nAccess to menstrual products is a huge problem across sub-Saharan Africa, where an inability to afford sanitary products prompts many girls to avoid school during their periods. A 2014 Unesco report estimated that one in 10 girls miss school during menstruation, which means they miss out on 20% of their schooling each year.\n\nKenya is considered a leader in addressing this problem.\n\nIn 2004, it scrapped a tax on menstrual products. Similar \u201ctampon taxes\u201d, as they have been styled, have sparked protests in the UK and still exist in many US states.\n\nIn 2017, Kenya passed a law requiring the government to give free pads to all schoolgirls.\n\nUK pledges \u00a32m to help end stigma and shame of period poverty Read more\n\nBut there are concerns about whether the $4.5m (\u00a33.6m) set aside for the programme has improved access to sanitary products and increased school attendance.\n\nGeorge Magoha, the country\u2019s education cabinet secretary, told local media last month that a random sampling of schoolgirls indicated they had not received pads. Passaris said Magoha told female MPs on Wednesday that the programme has problems with budgetary constraints and procurement.\n\nPassaris added that the project\u2019s budget would need to be \u201cat least 10 times\u201d larger if it were to provide free sanitary towels for all of Kenya\u2019s schoolgirls.\n\nThe education ministry and Teachers Service Commission of Kenya are conducting their own investigation into the schoolgirl\u2019s death, said Passaris, with a report scheduled for publication in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe had a candid discussion about sanitary towels, the little girl who died, and the investigation that is ensuing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make it so that girls aren\u2019t ashamed of their periods, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve won that battle yet.\u201d\n\n\u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
