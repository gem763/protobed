Subaru says the engine computer can keep powering the ignition coil after motors are shut off. That could cause a short circuit and blown fuse.\n\nDealers will update software and replace coils and front exhaust pipes if needed.\n\nThe second covers 205,000 Imprezas from 2017 through 2019 and 2018 Crosstreks. The aluminum positive crankcase ventilation valves can fall apart. Debris can enter the engine and cause power loss.\n\nDealers will replace valves if needed. If a valve has separated and parts can\u2019t be found, engines will be replaced.\n\nBoth recalls start Dec. 13.", "description": "Both major recalls start on December 13, 2019.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT938_Subaru_ZG_20191024111945.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
