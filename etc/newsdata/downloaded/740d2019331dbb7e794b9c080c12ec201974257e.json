She spoke in Buffalo, New York, earlier this week and is scheduled to appear in September in Little Rock, Arkansas; Chicago; and Raleigh, North Carolina. The Supreme Court will formally open its nine-month term on Oct. 7.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Only 34% of patients diagnosed at an early stage are alive five years later, according to the American Cancer Society. But the court said Ginsburg\u2019s tumor was confined to her pancreas, something that should improve her survival odds.\n\nWhile surgery often follows to remove pancreatic tumors, the court said Ginsburg didn\u2019t need additional treatment beyond the radiation.\n\nGinsburg survived early-stage pancreatic cancer once before, in 2009. She was also treated for colon cancer in 1999, and she underwent lung surgery to remove two cancerous growths in 2018.\n\nThe latest treatment involved doctors inserting a stent into her bile duct, a procedure that\u2019s done to allow bile to drain from the liver after a growth has started to crimp the tube shut.\n\nA departure by Ginsburg \u2014 or 81-year-old Justice Stephen Breyer \u2014 would clear the way for President Donald Trump to make his third appointment to the Supreme Court. That could be a crucial change on such issues as abortion, gay rights, gun control, immigration and Obamacare.\n\nGinsburg has repeatedly said she plans to stay on the court as long as she can do the job \u201cfull steam.\u201d\n\nThe discussion Saturday was designed to focus on the best-selling \u201cMy Own Words,\u201d a compilation of Ginsburg\u2019s writings, which was published in hardcover in 2016 and as a paperback a year ago.\n\nThe interview, by NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg, touched on the court\u2019s work, lawyers\u2019 occasional confusion of Ginsburg with retired Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor during court arguments, and Ginsburg\u2019s status as a liberal icon who\u2019s crossed over into pop-culture fame.\n\nGinsburg said she recently received a phone call from Jennifer Lopez, who wanted to meet the justice. Ginsburg said she later hosted the actress and her fianc\u00e9e, former Major League Baseball star Alex Rodriguez, in her Supreme Court chambers.\n\n\u201cShe mostly wanted to ask if I had any secret about a happy marriage,\u201d said Ginsburg, whose husband, Marty, died in 2010. The pair married in 1954.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court work has sustained her during health crises: \u201cIt has kept me going through four cancer bouts,\u201d she said", "authors": ["Greg Stohr"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/ginsburg-pancreatic-cancer-recovery.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
