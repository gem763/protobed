In court documents, the attorney, Ronald Kozlowski, told the judge that the student is a double major slated to graduate in May with plans to attend law school, that he had \u201cpersonally performed more than 210 hours of community service in the last two years\u201d and that he was a member of two honor societies on campus.\n\nKeeping Milaski in jail while he awaits trial, the attorney argued, would jeopardize his academic standing.\n\nIn the motion, Kozlowski also cited the deadly path of Hurricane Dorian, which at the time was expected to hit the student\u2019s South Florida hometown. If the judge waived or reduced the $125,000 bond, Milaski planned to help his parents with storm preparation, according to court documents.\n\nOn Sept. 5 the motion was granted, and Milaski was later released. He was ordered to wear a GPS monitoring device and banned from Alachua and Sarasota counties except for court appearances and to attend \u201cnecessary events\u201d at the University of Florida.\n\nKozlowski wrote in court documents that the incident \u201cwill be shown to be a misunderstanding among platonic friends fueled by alcohol.\u201d In an interview with The Washington Post, Kozlowski declined to elaborate on what he meant by that.\n\nThe woman told a reporter for the university student newspaper, the Alligator, that she is a sophomore. She declined to speak further about the incident, the Alligator reported, but she did write a Facebook post about her encounter with Milaski, saying that she \u201cwas sexually assaulted\u201d and that she will \u201ccontinue to fight this and continue to fight him.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post does not name victims of sexual assault without their consent.\n\nAccording to the arrest report, the victim told police that at 1:50 a.m. on Aug. 25, Milaski called her to say he was drunk and needed help. He asked her to bring him water, the woman told authorities. She met him and walked him back to his room in a residence hall next to hers. Milaski attempted to kiss her multiple times, the woman told police, and she said \u201cno\u201d multiple times.\n\nMilaski allegedly held the woman\u2019s wrist, said he wanted to sleep with her and prevented her from leaving his room, according to the report. She told police that she invented a story about retrieving her keys from the hallway but that before she could leave, Milaski grabbed her, picked her up and put her on his bed.\n\nMilaski climbed on top of her, according to the arrest report, and tried to put his hands beneath her underwear.\n\nAgain, she told police she cried for him to stop.\n\nEventually she broke free, the woman said, and met two male friends who walked her back to her dorm room. One stayed in the room with the woman and her roommate.\n\nAt 4 a.m., the woman told police she heard the door to her room open and saw someone standing in the entryway. The person, she said she realized, was Milaski, who attempted to lie down beside her, according to the arrest report.\n\nThe friend yelled at Milaski to leave, and he did.\n\nThe judge \u201cdid exactly what he was supposed to do under the law,\u201d Kozlowski told The Post of the court\u2019s decision to waive Milaski\u2019s bond. The judge would not have waived the bond, Kozlowski said, if he thought Milaski was a threat to the community at large or if he had a record of criminal activity.\n\n\u201cFrankly, his only record is one of distinction,\u201d Kozlowski said.\n\nUniversity of Florida spokesman Steve Orlando told the Alligator that an investigation was opened into the incident as soon as it was reported and that Milaski was arrested hours later. Orlando confirmed to the Alligator that Milaski was a resident assistant at the university.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had an incident happen like this before involving an RA,\u201d Orlando told the Alligator. \u201cStudent safety is our number one priority.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nShe reported her sexual assault.
