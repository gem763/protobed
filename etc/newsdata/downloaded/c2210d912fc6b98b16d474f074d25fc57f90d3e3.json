I eat very simply - only boiled food without oil or spices, rice and boiled daal (lentil stew) with a couple of green chillies.\n\nStanding five feet two inches tall, Mr Sivananda sleeps on a mat on the floor and uses a wooden slab as a pillow.\n\n'I avoid taking milk or fruits because I think these are fancy foods.

Nowadays people are unhappy, unhealthy and have become dishonest, which pains me a lot,' he said.\n\n'I just want people to be happy, healthy and peaceful.'\n\nSo far the oldest person ever was Jeanne Louise Calment from France, who reached the age of 122 years and 164 days.\n\nThe oldest person who is currently alive and recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records is Kane Tanaka of Japan, aged 116 years and 278 days.", "description": "Swami Sivananda's passport says that he was born on August 8, 1896, in Behala, India.
