It is not clear if the boy was in pain.\n\nOnce in The Hear Clinic, Oadby, Leicester, Mr Raithatha performed an examination to see where the twig had got lost.\n\nDeep in the ear canal, he found the twig nestled at the root. It is believed the twig was pushed down there by the toddler.\n\nKeeping the patient\u2019s head very still, Mr Raithatha was able to use an ear suction to pull it out in less than minute.\n\nHe used an endoscope, an instrument that can look inside the body and is usually attached to a video monitor so the doctor can see what's in the ear canal.\n\nMr Raithatha said it's the first time he has removed a twig from an ear\n\nAt the same time, a tiny instrument with gentle suction is able to attach to the object that is obstructing the passage and pull it out.\n\nIt is also used to remove build-up of earwax, which Mr Raithatha often films for his 144,000 subscribers on YouTube, reaching millions of views.\n\nIt's not the first time Mr Raithatha has revealed footage of un-blocking ears with strange items, including earrings and pen caps.\n\nSuch items, including twigs, can puncture the eardrum, causing sudden ear pain, sometimes bleeding from the ear, hearing loss, or noise in the ear.\n\nIt normally heals on its own but may need surgery, and is the reason health officials urge against using cotton buds.\n\nMr Raithatha said: 'Fortunately, there was no trauma or injury caused by the twig, which had a sharp pointed tip, to either the young boy\u2019s ear canal or eardrum.\n\n'I have previously removed a tooth comb, pen cap, earbud, earring, 22 hearing aid wax filters, plastic clothes tag, unidentified plastic object as well as several cotton buds from the ear canal.'\n\nIn December 2018, footage from Mr Raithatha showed the moment huge chunks of wax and a plastic clothes tag were pulled out of a patient's ear.\n\nAnd in January, Mr Raithatha removed the most dangerous object in his career - the tooth of a comb.", "description": "The unidentified youngster's mother rushed him to a specialist clinic in Leicester after he had pushed a 'branch' into his ear.
