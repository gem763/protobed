Just as much real estate in the cooler cases belongs to the extensive array of canned cocktails called chuhai.\n\nThe base for chuhai is shochu, a distilled liquor usually made from rice or barley, and just about any fruit flavor is fair game to mix in. As such, most companies have a rotating lineup of seasonal flavors, but Suntory is about to release an especially unique chuhai for its Strong Zero line, called the -196\u00b0C Strong Zero Salty Lemon Exclusively for Karaage.\n\nSo what\u2019s karaage? Japanese-style fried chicken.\n\nSeasoned with garlic and ginger, karaage is popular with people of all ages, but it\u2019s an especially beloved accompaniment to a few stiff drinks. Wisely reasoning that people picking up a canned chuhai to enjoy at home also often pick up some take-out karaage to go with it, Suntory has crafted its new Strong Zero to be the perfect pairing for karaage, with an especially strong lemon flavor to mimic the squeeze of fresh lemon juice that\u2019s customarily added to karaage before eating it, plus a salty finish to accentuate the chicken\u2019s meaty deliciousness.\n\n-196\u00b0C Strong Zero Salty Lemon Exclusively for Karaage goes on sale Nov 26 in both 350 and 500 milliliter cans. Just remember that, like all Strong Zero flavors, they\u2019re nine percent alcohol, so remember to pace yourself (on both the booze and bird).\n\nSource: PR Times via Livedoor News/Gadget Tsushin via Otakomu\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Forget chocolate and strawberry \u2013 Japan now has fried chicken-flavored ice cream\n\n-- We hold a 14-nation taste test of Karaage-kun, Japan\u2019s favorite convenience store fried chicken\n\n-- Fried chicken-flavor rice spread going on sale in Japan to keep your karaage cravings satisfied\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/19/suntorys-brilliant-new-canned-cocktail-is-made-specifically-to-taste-great-with-fried-chicken/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores devote a lot of space to canned alcoholic beverages, but not all of it is beer.
