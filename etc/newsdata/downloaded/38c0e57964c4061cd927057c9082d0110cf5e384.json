In the city\u2019s private driving schools, students pay a $60 fee for a 45-day course, which includes oral and practical driving tests at the country\u2019s Traffic Department.\n\nSome female students, including 21-year-old Kanaz pictured above during a driving lesson, complain of unwanted gazes and physical harassment on the cramped, crowded minibuses that are often the only method of urban public transport. Of the seven female drivers at the training course, two said that while they would get their driving licenses, they never planned to drive because they believe the mainly conservative society was not yet ready to accept female drivers.", "description": "The streets of Kabul, one of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities, are increasingly blocked by cars and buses.", "authors": ["Mohammad Ismail"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ9uJQgp9BV4g-ZmhN9WE90sGWz_CY-vNgoPdUXByfYVGkNtoflhIX0Dc5en-E4x6XWx4w8jY-ROhIhYSMTZSBPDWM-6czre2LbvuVebezlEP"}
