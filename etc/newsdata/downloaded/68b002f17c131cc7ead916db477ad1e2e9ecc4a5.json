He matched a season high with eight strikeouts and retired his last 11 batters.\n\nThe 30-year-old Porcello is 73-55 in five seasons with the Red Sox, including winning the 2016 American League Cy Young award. He was acquired from the Detroit Tigers in December 2014.\n\nV\u00e1zquez broke a third-inning tie with a two-run homer. It was Boston\u2019s 239rd homer this season, breaking the franchise record set in 2003.\n\nV\u00e1zquez has 23 home runs this season in 136 games after hitting 10 in 291 games during his first four seasons. He was removed in the third inning with a tight left hamstring.\n\nMoreland also hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning. Devers hit a solo shot in the seventh.\n\nMoreland, who played his first seven major league seasons with Texas before joining the Red Sox as a free agent in December 2016, hit his two-run shot as part of a four-hit game that matched his career best. His other four-hit game was as a member of the Rangers in August 2015.\n\nDevers also doubled and leads the AL with 88 extra base hits.\n\nKolby Allard (4-2), who was acquired on July 30 from the Atlanta Braves, allowed five runs in three innings, losing his second straight start. Texas has lost nine of 10.\n\nRougned Odor had a two-run double for the Rangers during a three-run first inning. Odor leads Texas with 86 RBIs and is hitting .203.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRangers DH Willie Calhoun was hit by a pitch in the left elbow in the first inning and left the game with a forearm bone contusion. \u2026 Red Sox RF Mookie Betts (toe) and 2B Brock Holt (knee) will probably return for Friday\u2019s home game opening the team\u2019s final series against Baltimore. \u2026 Boston LHP David Price (wrist) is scheduled to have surgery on Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRangers LHP Mike Minor (13-10, 3.52) will take his third and final shot at setting a career mark for wins in the series finale on Thursday afternoon after losing his two previous starts. The Red Sox will throw a bullpen game, probably beginning with LHP Brian Johnson (1-3, 6.05).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Christian V\u00e1zquez, Mitch Moreland and Rafael Devers homered, and Rick Porcello won what could be his final start for Boston as the Red Sox beat the Texas Rangers 10-3 Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/red_sox_rangers_baseball_53227_c0-224-4229-2689_s1770x1032.jpg?50eaae7da2fb142f535d9af884b19b42d42bbd3e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
