REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket, Sainsbury\u2019s (SBRY.L), vowed on Friday to halve plastic packaging by 2025, promising to switch to alternative materials and refillable options to meet consumer demand for less waste.\n\nHaving reduced plastic packaging by just 1% in 2018, Sainsbury\u2019s said a \u201ctransformational leap in thinking\u201d was required to tackle the almost 120,000 tonnes of plastic packaging it uses a year.\n\nIt said it used the most plastic in milk bottles, packaging for fruit and vegetables, and drinks. For milk bottles it is reviewing options including the use of refillable bottles, returnable milk bottles or offering a reusable jug with milk in a lightweight plastic pouch.\n\nEmploying 178,000 people across the country, Sainsbury\u2019s on Friday will attend a summit with suppliers, researchers and government groups to identify potential areas for a breakthrough.\n\n\u201cReducing plastic and packaging is not easy,\u201d Chief Executive Mike Coupe said. \u201cPackaging plays a vital role in keeping our food safe and fresh and minimising food waste.\n\n\u201cWe must therefore find alternatives to plastic that protect the quality of our food while minimising our impact on the environment.\u201d\n\nBritons have become increasingly aware of the amount of plastic they use following David Attenborough\u2019s \u201cBlue Planet II\u201d documentary which highlighted the dangers of plastic pollution to marine life.\n\nIn recent years Britain has managed to slash the use of plastic bags by charging 5 pence for each bag, and the government has considered imposing a \u201clatte levy\u201d on disposable coffee cups which are hard to recycle.\n\nBritain\u2019s biggest supermarket, Tesco (TSCO.L), has also stepped up efforts to encourage shoppers to recycle plastic bottles by testing in-store recycling machines that pay customers for every bottle returned.", "description": "Britain's second-biggest supermarket, Sainsbury's , vowed on Friday to halve plastic packaging by 2025, promising to switch to alternative materials and refillable options to meet consumer demand for less waste.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429332246&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0AA", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
