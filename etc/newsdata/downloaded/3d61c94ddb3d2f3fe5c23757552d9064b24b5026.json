As in, grow it by 100% or more? Here\u2019s the surest and safest way to do it quickly.\n\nWell, before we get into getting rich, let\u2019s talk about income. Not everyone needs to grow their pile of money bigger and bigger. Some of us are done accumulating and are looking for cash flow to help us cruise through retirement.\n\nSo, we have two options:\n\nOption 1: Invest for Income Today\n\nPortfolio\n\nPut some of the cash pile into safe funds and stocks. I can show you where to find 7.2% yields, which means you can build a \u201cno withdrawal\u201d portfolio that spins off, say, $72,000 on a million bucks (again, thanks to the 7.2% dividends).\n\nOf course, today mainstream bonds pay 1%-something and few blue-chip stocks pay over 2%. So popular payouts won\u2019t get it done. Fortunately, you\u2019re talking to one of the guys who wrote the book on retiring on dividends! Our Contrarian Income Report portfolio pays 7.2% today\u2013it\u2019s doable to find these types of yields if you know where to look.\n\nOption 2: Double Your Money Every Few Years (Also with Dividends)\n\nOur strategy here is similar to our first one, except we are prioritizing tomorrow\u2019s dividends over today\u2019s. So, it is the trajectory of our payouts that is most important.\n\nWhy? Because stock prices tend to rise as fast as their dividends.\n\nFor example, PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ: ), has made its investors rich thanks to its ability to grow its dividend. Check out the orange staircase below\u2013that\u2019s the payout that PepsiCo hikes every year. Its stock price (blue line below) is attracted to the payout curve like a magnet. Here\u2019s their relationship ever since the beverage maker began paying a dividend:\n\nEvery Pepsi Payout Refreshes the World\n\nPEP Dividend Price Lockstep\n\nAnd we can see that over the last five years, its 46% payout growth has perfectly predicted its 46% price gains:\n\nFor the Love of It(s Dividend)\n\nPEP Price Dividend Steady Recent\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s payout growth has slowed in recent years as it\u2019s filled the market for sugar water. Sub-10% annual dividend growth is unacceptable for true dividend growth investors like us!\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s best years of payout growth are behind it. Same goes for many other Dividend Aristocrats, the stocks that have hiked their dividends for 25 or more consecutive years. They are treated like royalty, so their valuations are always high and their current yields are rather low. But it doesn\u2019t make sense to reward past accomplishments since the stock market is a forward\u2013looking vehicle.\n\nWhich is why my Hidden Yields advisory focuses on stocks that are raising their payouts well more than average. I\u2019m talking about 18% dividend increases year-over-year!\n\nThe result? Our HY portfolio is up 29.7% year-to-date. At this rate, our money is going to double in just over two years! And sure, the market is up and that\u2019s helped. But we\u2019ll gladly \u201csettle\u201d for the 17.4% per year our portfolio has delivered since inception, too!\n\nBut, What About a Recession?\n\nOur timely buys are a key ingredient in our secret sauce. And constant recession worries help us out.\n\nLet\u2019s rewind to December, when every contrarian indicator was telling us that stocks were ready to rally. While individual investors worried that a 20% decline would snowball into a 40% crash, we saw sentiment at extreme lows and smartly bought not one but two dividend growers on December 21.\n\nThe timing was right, as were our picks. Just three days later, the stock market bottomed and began an epic rally that took the S&P 24% higher. That was cute, but Mr. Market had nothing on our two purchases, which sprung an average of 51% in just seven months!\n\nHow to Make 51% in 7 Months\n\nTimely HY Buys\n\nNow December-type opportunities don\u2019t happen often. Most of the time, the market meanders between extremes and stocks are neither obvious buys nor sells. You could just as well flip a coin to figure out where shares are likely to head in the short-term.\n\nBut, it\u2019s a weighted coin.\n\nStocks are better than heads or tails. They go up two-thirds of the time. This is why it\u2019s important to be fully invested at all times.\n\nThe always-bearish \u201cgurus\u201d you read elsewhere on the Internet? Their returns are pitiful. They may avoid crashes, but they don\u2019t know when to get back in. So they lag us, and they\u2019ll never catch up.\n\nThat\u2019s not an exaggeration. Let\u2019s use the last four years as an example. Since we launched HY in the summer of 2015, I\u2019ve been hearing from subscribers worried about a repeat of 2008. And hey, I get it\u2013we\u2019re all 11 years older now and we can\u2019t afford a rerun.\n\nBut we can\u2019t afford to be out of the market, either. Here\u2019s why. Any portfolio that\u2019s been half in-cash since we launched Hidden Yields needed 35% returns from its stock-portion to merely keep up with us. Not possible (again, if possible, the person would own the NYSE!)\n\nAnother reason to stay invested? Fall 2019 could be just like the autumn of 1995. That was the last time the Fed cut interest rates while the stock market was surging.\n\nMy pal and finance quant Troy Bombardia considered this and every previous case in which the Fed tossed the markets an \u201ceasy money cut.\u201d The S&P 500 averaged 15.5% returns over the next twelve months.\n\nRewind to July 1995: The Last \u201cEasy Money\u201d Cut\n\nFed Cuts Market Rallies Chart\n\n\u201cBrett, What\u2019s the Best Way to Increase Wealth Long-Term?\u201d\n\nSeveral subscribers have written in recently asking which dividend strategy is the best one to increase their wealth over the long haul. That\u2019s easy. It\u2019s Hidden Yields and its 17%+ yearly returns.\n\nAt this rate, we\u2019re doubling our money about every four years. We\u2019re doing it simply by buying the stocks that are increasing their dividends the fastest. And we\u2019re buying without worrying about the bear market boogeyman that unravels most investors.\n\nRemember, for us, bear markets are buying opportunities. December sure was! Our secret was that we didn\u2019t panic. We held onto our elite dividend growers and used the opportunity to buy more.\n\nTo quote the late, great Eddie Money, many investors \u201cwanna go back\u201d and buy those December bargains. Of course they can\u2019t, but you can do the next best thing and buy my seven favorite dividend growers right now.\n\nDon\u2019t regret not buying these seven when we revisit these picks months from now! All are poised for fast 50% gains like the two examples we smartly bought in December.\n\n7 Dividend Stocks Ready to Return a Fast 50%\n\nI use computers, screens, tools and my own head to uncover dividend moonshots that will easily pay you 17% per year. That\u2019s enough to double your money in just over 4 years.\n\nImagine, turning a retirement \u2018pot\u2019 of $250,000 into $500,000\u2026 or\u2026 $500,000 into $1,000,000\u2026 and on it goes.\n\nDisclosure: Brett Owens and Michael Foster are contrarian income investors who look for undervalued stocks/funds across the U.S. markets.
