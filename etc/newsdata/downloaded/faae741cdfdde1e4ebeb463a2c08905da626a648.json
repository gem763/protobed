The most notable program debuting next year \u2014 dubbed Featured Providers \u2014 is the result of a partnership with Embold Health, a startup founded by former Walmart CMO Daniel Stein that's aimed at quantifying provider performance based on big-data analytics. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nFeatured Providers is designed to curb unnecessary healthcare procedures, which Walmart claims are responsible for approximately one-third of all medical costs in the US. The program is only coming to select markets in Florida, Texas, and Northwest Arkansas (near the Walmart HQ) at first. But if it delivers significant savings, we're likely to see Featured Providers brought to scale for Walmart's approximate 1.5 million US employees \u2014 or about 1% of the US working population.\n\nThe company's wide-sweeping benefits experiment also includes expanded telehealth offerings for a greater number of Walmart workers, a personalized health concierge program to assist employees through their healthcare journeys, a new fitness program, and extended access to a provider locator tool for all Walmart associates on an employee health plan. This announcement is the latest in a string of big healthcare plays from Walmart, including the rollout of its first standalone primary care clinic.\n\nWalmart is expanding on the success of an earlier cost-cutting experiment, dubbed Centers of Excellence. Unveiled in 2013, the Centers of Excellence program connects Walmart employees with specialist care at some of the best hospitals in their region. This means that if an employee enrolled in one of Walmart's medical plans is told by their local physician that they need a hip replacement, for example, they can opt to consult with doctors from and undergo the procedure at one of Walmart's preferred providers. Walmart then covers the visit, as well as travel, lodging, and food for both the patient and caregiver. However, Centers of Excellence revealed that over half of employees who were recommended for spinal surgery by their local doctors were later informed that the procedure was unnecessary.\n\nExcessive medical treatment and testing contributes to over $200 billion in wasted spending each year in the US, per Kaiser Health News. And given that employer health costs in the US are projected to rise 6% in 2020, nearly double the rate of inflation, Walmart has a major incentive to try to cut down on the number of unnecessary, high-ticket healthcare expenditures billed by its workers. By leveraging Embold Health's insights, Walmart can guide employees toward \"top-performing\" physicians as assessed on the trifecta of appropriateness, efficiency, and cost.\n\nWe expect to see other employers turning to digital health startups to explore how to cut costs and improve employee benefits. Walmart isn't the only big-name company partnering with a hot, young, digital health firm to wrangle out-of-control healthcare costs: Just last week, Amazonannounced its new virtual care platform Amazon Care for select Seattle employees, a service that draws on the expertise of 98point6 to deliver text-based, on-demand primary care.\n\nAnd grocery chain Krogerannounced earlier this year that it would be partnering with genetic testing startup Myriad Genetics to match employees living with treatment-resistant depression to medications that may be a better fit, based on their genetics. Granted, Kroger's decision didn't exactly go as planned after the FDA ordered Myriad to change its GeneSight test and demanded the company halt medication recommendations for the time being. But employers are likely more open to the risk that comes with inking a deal with potentially unproven startups: The cost of a failed experiment, given the pressures of skyrocketing healthcare costs, is likely worth it for the chance at a major money-saving breakthrough.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
