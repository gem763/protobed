It is one of Europe\u2019s most heavily militarized areas, patrolled constantly to deter illegal immigration into the European Union.\n\nSoufli, a once-booming silk factory town in Greece\u2019s remote northeastern Thrace region, saw its centuries-old tradition of silkworm rearing, weaving and dying nearly snuffed out during Greece\u2019s decade-long financial crisis. The town had already suffered a heavy blow when cheaper Chinese and Indian silk flooded the market in the 1990s. The companies that managed to survive then were later finished off during the financial crisis that erupted in 2008.\n\nBy 2012, there were only two silk makers left in the town, eking out an existence by supplying small home furnishing stores.\n\nYet seven years later, Mouhtaridis has few complaints. The company founded by his father in 1977 has been revived by Greece\u2019s resurgent fashion and luxury goods industry as well as by technology that helps small-scale producers.\n\n\u201cWe used to give (silk products) to stores that took five, 10 meters (32 feet), or 50 meters (165 feet),\u201d Mouhtaridis said, speaking at his factory, which employs 10 people. \u201cThe maximum (order) we would get was 100 meters (320 feet).\u201d\n\nHe now produces more than 200 times that amount annually for his largest customer.\n\nSilk is the staple of offerings at Zeus + Dione, a luxury Athens label that prides itself on reinventing and incorporating laboriously-made elements found in traditional Greek garments onto its easy-to-wear women\u2019s line. Craftspeople were scouted out in rural areas around Greece to make it happen, as the company sought to inject glamor to dying trades that typically struggled to connect with city dwellers.\n\nThe label\u2019s flagship store is now in a trendy shopping area in central Athens and the company\u2019s co-owner, bank executive Mareva Grabowski, is married to newly-elected conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. She founded the company with her friend Dimitra Kolotoura, a former PR executive.\n\nKolotoura remembers walking into Mouhtaridis\u2019 silk factory as her company was just starting out seven years ago. He was skeptical when asked for 20 meters (65 feet) of \u2018spathoto\u2019 - an embossed silk that has become the firm\u2019s signature fabric.\n\n\u201cWe said: \u2018Let\u2019s start the engines! We are going to produce, we are going to weave, we are going to create new fabrics,\u201d Kolotoura says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to experiment.\u201d\n\nThe twist on tradition caught the attention of the fashion world and orders from overseas snowballed. Silk shirts and caftans made from spathoto and Amalia-motif fabric types can be found on sale in Los Angeles, Paris, London and elsewhere.\n\nSoufli\u2019s other main silk maker, Giorgos Tsiakiris, found an alternate route to survival, giving up weaving to focus on printing. When the future of the family enterprise seemed uncertain, he bet the business on expensive digital technology.\n\nThe bet is paying off. Replacing traditional dying with a computerized system and buying room-sized printing machines revolutionized his operation, allowing him to provide customized designs requested by fashion houses all over Europe, among them the Greek label Parthenis.\n\nOrsalia Parthenis took over the company from her parents, renewing a relationship with the silk factory that went back to the 1970s.\n\nSoufli silk was \u201cpart of my growing up,\u201d she says, noting that she always found creative ways to include it in her collections.\n\n\u201cSoufli had focused mostly on traditional furnishing fabrics, things you\u2019d use for curtains or tablecloths,\u201d she says, adding that instead she chose to use those fabrics for dresses, shorts and jackets.\n\nWhen she found out that Tsiakiris was printing silk in 2006, Parthenis jumped at the chance to reach out to graphic designers and created a silk caftan line.\n\n\u201cThey invested in machines to do more printing and it wasn\u2019t just the weaving part,\u201d she says. \u201cTechnology is what revived the industry.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Mier at http://www.twitter.com/imlavin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At Kostas Mouhtaridis' silk factory in Soufli, the non-stop \"clunk-click\" of the weaving machinery is a loud but welcome sound.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Iliana Mier"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/greece_silk_revival_22857_c0-235-5616-3509_s1770x1032.jpg?22449b62918975d4b3a41c3dcdea763d54d91807", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
