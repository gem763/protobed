It follows months of negotiations between the union and Chicago Public Schools that failed to resolve disputes over pay and benefits, class size and teacher preparation time.\n\nThe strike is Chicago\u2019s first major walkout by teachers since 2012 and city officials announced early Wednesday that all classes were canceled for Thursday in hopes of giving more planning time for parents.\n\nChicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey said Wednesday night the hope is for a \u201cshort strike with an agreement that will benefit our schools and our teachers.\u201d He said Thursday morning while joining picketers outside Peirce elementary school that striking teachers have long been frustrated by their classroom sizes and crowded conditions they face while trying to teach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pent-up frustration among our membership about what conditions are like in our schools,\u201d he said, noting that Peirce elementary doesn\u2019t have a kindergarten class with fewer than 30 students.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot said she was disappointed by the union\u2019s decision to strike.\n\n\u201cWe are offering a historic package on the core issues \u2014 salary, staffing and class size,\u201d she said Wednesday night at a news conference, adding that school district negotiators will remain at the bargaining table and that she hopes the union does, too.\n\nDuring the 2012 strike, the district kept some schools open for half days during a seven-day walkout. District officials said this time they will keep all buildings open during school hours, staffed by principals and employees who usually work in administrative roles.\n\nBreakfast and lunch will be served, but all after-school activities and school buses are suspended.\n\nJanice Jackson, the district\u2019s CEO, encouraged parents to send their children to the school that they normally attend, however they will be welcome in any district schools.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put together a really comprehensive plan for the students,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe will make sure they are safe and they have a productive day.\u201d\n\nAlso striking will be 7,000 support staffers, whose union also failed to reach a contract agreement.\n\nBefore the strike announcement, June Davis said if teachers walked out, she would likely send her 7-year-old son, Joshua, to his usual elementary school - Smyth Elementary on the city\u2019s South Side where almost all students are low-income and minority.\n\nDavis, 38, said she would otherwise have to take her son to his grandmother\u2019s in a southern suburb, requiring an hourlong trip on a regional bus line.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s hoping they will come to some kind of agreement, find some compromise,\u201d Davis said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chicago teachers went on strike Thursday, marching on picket lines after failing to reach a contract deal with the nation's third-largest school district in a dispute that canceled classes for more than 300,000 students.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kathleen Foody", "Don Babwin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/chicago_schools-strike_33799_c0-54-4800-2854_s1200x700.jpg?f9700b94a927ec963f6fed3bf19819dce6928f97", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
