I used to not care much for how my characters looked in video games. Just give me the pants that will keep most of the bullets out of my arse, you know? I am also used to making small concessions when my personal aesthetic is offended. I hate most video game helmets, and I\u2019ll gladly ditch the stat boost that a goofy hat offers if it looks hideous. Also, if given the option, I will make human characters that are my skin\u2019s shade of brown.\n\nPart of it is that I\u2019ve never really role-played in games. If a game like Mass Effect asks my character for input, I would more or less answer as Joshua, The Human Playing This Video Game. I guess this means I role-played as myself, which I gather is the corniest way to role-play, and why everyone booed me whenever I picked the most human-like species in a given video game for my character.\n\nMy attitude on this has been shifting, though, and I think game fashion is helping push it along. Fashion and style are forms of expression, a way to put a little more of yourself out into the world. They\u2019re also a way to try on something new, something that isn\u2019t just \u201cyourself\u201d in a game.\n\nVideo games, both those that encourage role-playing and those that do not, give you an arena in which you can try new things, slap together bold new ideas and see how they play out. As I\u2019ve been thinking about all this, I\u2019ve found myself getting a little bored with my \u201cplaying as Joshua\u201d habits. Why stick with the same playstyle forever? Why play as a character who doesn\u2019t have an opinion about how they look?\n\nSo I built a character in Daemon X Machina. I wanted them to be a real character with a style and attitude different from my own, like a character in a work of fiction I was writing. I started the way everyone starts: with how they look.\n\nI decided my pilot would have a penchant for lavender, like Jane the Virgin\u2019s Rogelio De La Vega. Personality-wise, she would also have a compulsion for flair and style that would often get her into some tactical trouble. This character choice worked out because I feel extremely cool playing this game, so cool that I don\u2019t really want to take the time to be strategic.\n\nMoiraX and her work-in-progress mech.\n\nI can relate to this character, whom I have named MoiraX, since I\u2019m avidly reading Marvel\u2019s House of X and Powers of X miniseries. By the way, Moira McTaggert? She rules.\n\nUnfortunately, I can only customise MoiraX\u2019s look so much with the game\u2019s starting gear. That didn\u2019t keep me from spending forty minutes trying out colour schemes for her plug suit. I would have easily spent another forty on her mech\u2019s paint job, but I was on a train with finite time before I reached my destination.\n\nThat\u2019s all right, though. I\u2019m not sure what I have on currently is what MoiraX would settle for, but she works with what she has. Guess I\u2019ll have to keep playing to find more gear. And also so I can find out a little bit more about what she\u2019s like.", "description": "I recently got my hands on Daemon X Machina, the new mech action game for the Nintendo Switch, and I was immediately dazzled \u2014 not by the power and might of my giant robot armour, or the weighty action of sci-fi combat \u2014 but by how much fun it was to style my mech and its pilot in some fly as hell fits....", "authors": ["Cecilia D'Anastasio", "Kotaku Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/t4oyz0mqttrbxkty2cyu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
