A survey conducted by the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services last November found that there were 57,873 children educated at home, a 27 per cent rise on the previous year.\n\n\u201cParents can move children to home education to avoid pressures at school, for example to avoid prosecution for non-attendance, and permanent exclusions,\u201d the Ofsted report said.\n\n\u201cFor some parents, facing fines or prosecution for a child missing school triggered a move a child to home education.\u201d\n\nThe inspectorate's study, based on research with families, schools and councils in the East Midlands, investigated why children move to home education from secondary school. It noted that it was often unclear whether parents who decided who home educate their children to avoid paying penalty notices were doing so as a tactic to \u201cplay the system\u201d.\n\nThe report went on to explain that parents who were issued with penalty notices for allowing their children to miss school often did so as a result of their \u201cneeds not being met\u201d.\n\nPupils are only allowed to miss school during term time if they are ill or if they have got advance permission from a teacher. Local councils can take various forms of legal action against parents who allow their children to miss school for any other reason.\n\nThis could be forcing them to attend parenting classes, appointing a child supervisor or issuing a penalty notice where parents have to pay a fine.\n\nFailure to comply with these measures could lead to prosecution. Ofsted said that it also found evidence of pupils being \u201coff-rolled\u201d into home education, meaning teachers have forced a family to remove their children from school rather than it being their choice.\n\nThe report added that for many families, home education is not a preferred choice but a last resort amid a breakdown in relationships with schools.\n\nSpecial educational needs, medical and behavioural reasons are among the main motives for pupils being moved out of schools, Ofsted's new paper says. Chief inspector Amanda Spielman said children should not switch to home education \"simply to resolve difficulties in schools\".\n\nThe report found that the length of time for a child to be moved to home education can be very short. \"The period between a parent finding out about the possibility of home education and their child leaving school can be as little as one day,\" inspectors said. \"In extreme circumstances, moving a child to home education took as little as a day\u201d.\n\nMs Spielman, said: \"Home education is a legitimate parental choice and can be a positive decision when parents are well equipped to provide a good education.\n\n\"However, children should not be moved to home education simply to resolve difficulties in school.\u201d", "description": "Homeschooling is on the rise, figures show, with some parents teaching their children themselves to avoid prosecution and fines.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education/2018/06/14/TELEMMGLPICT000139442675-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqE33fIs64eBxy2Ueorj1JP90az1zyErIysKdytM-hS-k.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
