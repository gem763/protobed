The Cardinals needed immediate help with both starter David Johnson and backup Chase Edmonds injured, and with a Thursday night game looming against the undefeated San Francisco 49ers.\n\nAD\n\nOne sure sign that something was happening with Drake: Despite being healthy, he didn\u2019t travel with the team to Pittsburgh for Monday night\u2019s game. Miami did not want to risk him getting injured before any trade is finalized.\n\nAD\n\nLater Monday, news broke that the Jets are trading defensive end Leonard Williams to the Giants for a third-round pick in next year\u2019s draft and a fifth-round pick in 2021 that will become a fourth-round pick if Williams signs a contract extension before the start of the league year, Adam Schefter reported.\n\nWilliams, the sixth pick of the 2015 draft, was a Pro Bowler in 2016 but has otherwise underperformed. The Jets have depth along their defensive line, as well, making him expendable in the final year of his contract. What the 2-6 Giants are thinking with this trade is less clear, considering they almost certainly won\u2019t be making any sort of playoff push this season. They may have made the move in anticipation of trading away Dalvin Tomlinson, who can play two positions along the line.\n\nAD\n\nAlso of note: It\u2019s the first time the Giants and Jets have ever completed a trade (a 1983 trade involving offensive lineman Chris Foote was nullified). Williams also was the last member of the Jets\u2019 2015 draft class to remain with the team (the Giants also don\u2019t have anyone left from their 2015 draft class).\n\nAD\n\nAlso on Monday, the Eagles acquired Browns defensive end Genard Avery for an undisclosed 2021 draft pick.\n\nLast week saw a lot of activity, with the league\u2019s two remaining unbeaten teams moving last week to strengthen themselves at wide receiver. The San Francisco 49ers picked up Emmanuel Sanders from the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots obtained Mohamed Sanu from the Atlanta Falcons. Sanu caught two passes for 23 yards in New England\u2019s win over the Browns; Sanders caught four passes for 25 yards in the 49ers\u2019 rout of Carolina.\n\nAD\n\nIn other moves, the Jacksonville Jaguars unloaded disgruntled cornerback Jalen Ramsey, sending him to the Los Angeles Rams. As soon as he finished serving a week-long suspension for disagreeing with Patriots defensive line coach Bret Bielema, Michael Bennett was traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a draft pick. The Rams sent Marcus Peters to the Baltimore Ravens for linebacker Kenny Young and a draft pick and the Detroit Lions traded safety Quandre Diggs to the Seattle Seahawks in a deal that included draft picks.\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s a look at other possible moves:\n\nAlthough he hasn\u2019t been especially impressive since ending his holdout, there should be interest in Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon, who watched as Austin Ekeler and Justin Jackson filled in ably during his holdout. The team, though, will be asking for a lot in return, according to NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport.\n\nAD\n\nThe Bengals\u2019 A.J. Green can become an unrestricted free agent after the season and he could command a first-round pick in a trade. However, Cincinnati doesn\u2019t seem to have much interest in trading the wide receiver despite what they could get in return, and Rapoport reported Sunday that the Bengals likely will not trade him. The winless Bengals don\u2019t seem interested in unloading players like tight end Tyler Eifert, either, but that could change, according to the NFL Network.\n\nAD\n\nWhile there\u2019s a premium being placed on wide receivers, Fox Sports\u2019 Jay Glazer reported that DeAndre Hopkins of the Texans isn\u2019t on the trading block.\n\nThe Washington Redskins are in the midst of a lost season, but they remain adamant that they will not trade offensive lineman Trent Williams, whose holdout continues. The Cleveland Browns, who are expected to be active in the market, have aggressively pursued Williams, according to CBS\u2019s Jason La Canfora, with New York Giants left tackle Nate Solder their other big target. (On Monday, NFL Network reported that the Redskins are, in fact, open to dealing Williams.) Ryan Kerrigan is drawing interest from, among others, the Baltimore Ravens and Indianapolis Colts, according to La Canfora, who reported that the Redskins are showing no signs of looking to move Kerrigan.\n\nAD\n\nBecause the Rams plan to pay Ramsey big bucks at some point, they are willing to entertain offers for cornerback Aqib Talib, according to ESPN. Although he has been on IR with a rib injury, he is eligible to be traded and could help a contending team later this season.\n\nAD\n\nQuarterback Marcus Mariota seems to have no future in Tennessee, so the Titans might be willing to answer calls about the No. 2 pick in the 2015 NFL draft from a team that thinks they could turn him around. The logical landing spot might be in Chicago, where Mitchell Trubisky has been ineffective and the Bears are losing ground in the NFC North.\n\nThe Raiders reportedly are interested in Jets receiver Robby Anderson, who\u2019s in the final year of his contract, but a less costly option could be Josh Gordon, whom the Patriots placed on injured reserve and plan to release when he is healthy.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking of the Patriots, Jay Glazer reported Monday that they\u2019re \u201cstill in the market for a receiver,\" even after last week\u2019s trade for Mohamed Sanu. Green, Anderson, DeVante Parker, Nelson Agholor and Paul Richardson could be targets for New England.\n\nAD\n\nThe Lions have received calls inquiring about the availability of cornerback Darius Slay, according to ESPN.\n\nOther players to keep an eye on include Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley, who reportedly is on the block, with the Texans a possible trading partner after J.J. Watt suffered a season-ending injury Sunday; Dolphins receiver DeVante Parker; and Broncos cornerback Chris Harris, who is on a one-year contract and could help teams like the Seahawks, Eagles or Rams.\n\nAD\n\nRead more NFL coverage from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "Teams have until 4 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday to load up for the second half of the season.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jJdC5ANsv0kUcCkOAyFReSfwo80=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UYNZ3LXVYAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
