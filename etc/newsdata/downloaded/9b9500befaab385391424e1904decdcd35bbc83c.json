We will be competitive and we will trouble top teams, may even upset one if it all comes magically together. We have a decent draw if we can beat Wales. If we top our pool, we play France or Argentina in the quarter-finals and will be too strong for them. That gives us a semi-final, most probably against South Africa or New Zealand, maybe Ireland, at which time our tournament will end. If we are very lucky and face Ireland \u2013 who are a much more settled team but have shown some weaknesses recently \u2013 we might make a final. But I very much doubt it.\n\nWe have a decent pack and lineout, but our No 6 is not a No 6. Michael Cheika will unbalance the pack and play the Michael Hooper and David Pockock combo, which does not work. Our bench players does not give us depth. We have brought an out-of-form and ageing Ashley Cooper instead of some of our best performers. One full-back can\u2019t catch high balls and the other has no pace. At least one winger has no pace. And, crucially for a World Cup, we don\u2019t have a consistent goal kicker. Still ... we can come together once in a while. Aiden Smith\n\nCanada\n\nThe \u201cglory days\u201d of the 1990s, when Canada could be competitive against all but the very big boys, are long gone and there is a widespread acceptance that the standard of rugby here has slipped and with it a huge opportunity has gone. Couple that with being placed in a \u201cpool of death\u201d and expectations among Canadian rugby fans are very low. The Namibia game represents our final. If we win that and put up a creditable performance against Italy, most fans will be satisfied. Tim Yobilo\n\nEngland\n\nEngland are not favourites but we are one of the main contenders. This World Cup is one of the most open, so I expect to see a lot of surprises and new heroes emerging from all countries. Hopefully England can win it all!||Here in Greece the faithful few are organising ourselves to see the games where we can, all together, even though we support different countries! I personally, due to my Newcastle heritage, want to see Mark Wilson continuing his good performances, making the North proud.

Argentina are a strong team and England are above us by far. Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.\n\nIt might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Gr\u00e9gory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime M\u00e9dard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn\u2019t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit.

After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.\n\nGeorgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of \u201ctargeting\u201d one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.\n\nOne should be positive, it isn\u2019t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia\u2019s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam Hooker\n\nIreland\n\nIt seems mad to be saying I\u2019m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that\u2019s the mad position I\u2019m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan\u2019s confidence.\n\nRecent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I\u2019m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I\u2019m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I\u2019m going with is Scottish and I\u2019ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma Cassidy\n\nItaly\n\nWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we\u2019ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we\u2019ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano Martignago\n\nRugby World Cup 2019 stadium guide Read more\n\nNamibia\n\nHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy Silvester\n\nNew Zealand\n\nAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it\u2019s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn\u2019t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.\n\nArdie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I\u2019m excited for Retallick\u2019s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki Carter\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New Zealand are aiming to make it three in a row. Photograph: Phil Walter/Getty Images\n\nSamoa\n\nWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won\u2019t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O\u2019Connor\n\nScotland\n\nAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment; anything more a big surprise. It\u2019s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year\u2019s Six Nations). I\u2019m left with the impression that we\u2019re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.\n\nVern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let\u2019s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I\u2019m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I\u2019m also hoping the Ireland players don\u2019t complete a hat-trick of sneaky/mistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James Calder\n\n'I love watching, playing and learning from it': Gregor Townsend on football Read more\n\nSouth Africa\n\nI\u2019m approach the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people\u2019s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.\n\nHandre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa\u2019s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam Kantorowich\n\nUruguay\n\nI don\u2019t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I\u2019m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan Laffitte\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Juan Manuel Cat is ready to go. Photograph: Rich Fury/World Rugby via Getty Images\n\nUSA\n\nOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool \u2013 England, France, Argentina and Tonga \u2013 I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we\u2019ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won\u2019t lack spirit. Brendan Carey\n\nWales\n\nThis year could be our year. I\u2019m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we\u2019ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them. Will Davies", "description": "South Africa are confident. Scotland are hard to predict. Wales have high hopes.
