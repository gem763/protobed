But this won\u2019t change. I won\u2019t be stupid,\u201d he said in comments heard around the world on television.\n\nSpeaking to reporters ahead of the Russian Grand Prix on Thursday, Leclerc said he had gone too far and it would not happen again.\n\n\u201cI believe my reaction was well over what it should be and that shows that I\u2019ve still got a lot to learn,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn these situations, there was no absolutely need to be like this,\u201d he added. \u201cThe team has done the right thing, we finished first and second. We wouldn\u2019t have finished first and second with another strategy.\n\n\u201cIn the car it\u2019s always very difficult, there\u2019s a lot of adrenalin. I wake up in the morning thinking about victory, I go to sleep thinking about victory...I just need to control myself more in these situations and just shut up instead of speaking on the radio.\u201d\n\nLeclerc said the team rules on strategy after Singapore remained the same: \u201cIt\u2019s always and it always needs to be for the benefit of the team and that won\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nLeclerc has become a Ferrari fan favourite after taking his first Formula One win in Belgium at the start of the month and following it up with victory at their home Italian Grand Prix.\n\nSingapore was his third pole position in a row and he has outqualified Vettel, a four-times world champion, for the past eight races.\n\nThe youngster is third in the championship, 96 points behind Mercedes\u2019 Lewis Hamilton with six races remaining.\n\nFerrari team boss Mattia Binotto said in Singapore that he accepted Leclerc was annoyed and frustrated but saw that also as a positive.\n\nFormula One F1 - Russian Grand Prix - Sochi Autodrom, Sochi, Russia - September 26, 2019 General view of F1 team members with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc's car ahead of the Russian Grand Prix REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n\n\u201cIf you would be a driver, I think that\u2019s the right attitude to have,\u201d he told Sky Sports television.\n\n\u201cFor (the team) the scenarios are bigger and obviously by the time that he will understand the full picture I\u2019m pretty sure he will quickly understand the reason of the choice.\u201d\n\nMercedes have won every Russian Grand Prix since the first in 2014 but Ferrari could change that.
