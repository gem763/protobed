border pullback, alarming Kurds", "language": "en", "text": "Qamishli (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 US forces in Syria started pulling back Monday from Turkish border areas, opening the way for Ankara\u2019s threatened military invasion and heightening fears of a jihadist resurgence.\n\nThe withdrawal from key positions along Syria\u2019s northern border came after the White House said it would step aside to allow for a Turkish operation President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said could come at any moment.\n\nThe move marks a major shift in US policy, and effectively abandons the Kurds, who were Washington\u2019s main ally in the years-old battle against the so-called Islamic State group.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish militia that controls much of northeastern Syria, said early on Monday in a statement that \u201cUS forces withdrew from the border areas with Turkey\u201d.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor confirmed that US forces had pulled back from key positions in Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad.\n\nA Kurdish official also told AFP that US forces had started withdrawing from the border, making way for a Turkish invasion, the scope of which remains to be seen.\n\nTurkey has sent reinforcements to the border in recent weeks, and Erdogan said Monday in televised remarks the long-threatened offensive could \u201ccome any night without warning\u201d.\n\nHis comments came after Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Twitter that Turkey was \u201cdetermined to ensure our country\u2019s existence and security by clearing terrorists from this region.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to the SDF, which has ties to Kurdish militants inside Turkey and which Ankara considers a terrorist organisation.\n\n\u2013 \u2018At all costs\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cThe United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2019 will no longer be in the immediate area,\u201d the White House said.\n\nAnkara says it wants to urgently establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d on the other side of the border in which to send back some of the 3.6 million refugees who fled the eight-year war in Syria and live on Turkish soil.\n\nBut the Kurds argue that Turkey\u2019s goal is to weaken the Kurdish presence in the region by modifying the demographics of the area with the return of mostly Sunni Arab refugees.\n\nThe SDF, which has repeatedly complained that US President Donald Trump\u2019s declared intention to pull out of Syria was a historic betrayal, warned of the risks that a Turkish invasion would carry for the region.\n\nThe organisation, which spearheaded \u2014 with backing from the US-led coalition \u2014 several of the most significant battles against IS over the past five years, vowed to resist any Turkish attack.\n\n\u201cAs the Syrian Democratic Forces, we are determined to defend our land at all costs,\u201d it said in a statement posted on social media.\n\nIt said in a statement Monday that a Turkish offensive would reverse the military gains achieved against IS at great human cost and allow for the jihadist group\u2019s surviving leaders to come out of hiding.\n\n\u2013 Threat to the world \u2013\n\nThe Kurdish-dominated group said that the US pullback threatened to create a security vacuum that would \u201creverse the successful effort to defeat ISIS\u201d.\n\nIt highlighted that 11,000 Kurdish fighters had been killed in five years of war to eliminate a \u201ccaliphate\u201d that once covered an area the size of Great Britain in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe SDF also warned that the US withdrawal and imminent Turkish attack risked leading to the \u201creturn of leaders of ISIS who are hidden in the desert\u201d and other areas.\n\nThe Kurds have consistently warned that they would be unable to keep captured IS fighters behind bars if they had to dedicate the bulk of their forces to fighting back a Turkish offensive.\n\nThe SDF said in its statement that IS cells would break out detained jihadists from Kurdish prisons and take over camps where their relatives are held, \u201cwhich is a threat to local and international security.\u201d\n\nWhile a Kurdish-led operation earlier this year saw the death of IS\u2019s territorial caliphate, the organisation isn\u2019t dead and sleeper cells have been active in several parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe US itself has warned that, short of sustained international military pressure on the remnants of the jihadist group, IS would soon have the ability to regroup and reclaim some territorial control in the region.", "description": "Qamishli (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 US forces in Syria started pulling back Monday from Turkish border areas, opening
