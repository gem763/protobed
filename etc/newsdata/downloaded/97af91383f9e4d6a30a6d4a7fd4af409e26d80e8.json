If one needed a special diet due to religion or health, they did what all other students do, bring a lunch from home.\u201d\n\nIn responding, Maleyko described the policy as a cost-cutting measure.\n\n\u201cThe decision was based on operational considerations only, not religion. By implementing an all Halal meat option we have increased the number of students that we are serving\u2026.It would cost a lot more to provide both Halal and non-Halal meat,\u201d he said.\n\nGeller called on the district to rescind its policy. The measure amounts to a capitulation to \u201cIslamic supremacism\u201d and sets a dangerous precedent, she argued.\n\n\u201cDearborn Public School officials are demonstrating a totalitarian assuredness in the delusional comfort of enlightenment, diversity, and inclusion. They\u2019re in for an unpleasant surprise: they\u2019re accommodating a radically non-diverse, non-inclusive population,\u201d she also said.\n\nRevoking the policy would make schools \u201ctruly inclusive and diverse, accepting of all students, not just Muslim students,\u201d she pointed out.\n\nNevertheless, Geller pointed out that Dearborn is \u201cunlikely\u201d to rescind its all-halal meat policy, adding:\n\nThis initiative is already very far advanced. If you\u2019re in Europe, and in many areas in America as well, the meat you are eating is probably halal unless you\u2019re keeping kosher. In a little-known strike against freedom, yet again, we are being forced into consuming meat slaughtered by means of a barbaric, torturous, and inhuman method: Islamic slaughter.\n\nThe Dearborn region is reportedly home to the largest concentration of Muslims in the United States.", "description": "A concerned mother is challenging an all-halal meat policy imposed by public schools in the U.S. \u2018Arab capital\u2019 Dearborn, Michigan.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/lunch-debt-donors-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
