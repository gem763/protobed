This is batshit crazy.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cThese are the people who for the last four years have been fighting on our behalf, with our equipment to defeat ISIS, and they have done it with enormous efficacy, and they\u2019ve sacrificed immensely, and we basically just said to them, \u2018See ya. And let the Turks, who are like the hungry wolf trying to kill the lamb, go for it.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s just appalling because we promised the Kurds our partnership, and we promised them that if they worked with us to defeat our common enemy, then we would stand with them. And Trump woke up on the wrong side of the bed it appears and decided never mind, which is why suddenly Republicans in Congress have gotten a pulse today.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "In a preview clip from Monday's edition of CBS's \"The Late Show,\" Obama national security adviser Susan Rice said President Donald Trump's decision | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1171197946-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
