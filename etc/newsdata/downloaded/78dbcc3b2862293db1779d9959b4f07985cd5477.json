The El Gouna\u2019s panel of Refugee Voices In Film puts into perspective the importance of these films, debating why now is time for a change in their narratives.\n\nTelling their story: Why is it important?\n\nAccording to Shaden Khallaf, a panellist and UNHCR senior policy advisor, whilst the Middle East and North Africa only account for 5% of the global population, the region hosts 40% of the world\u2019s refugees.\n\nKhallaf highlights that it\u2019s up to citizens \u2014 and not only organisations \u2014 to be more conscious and respond to refugee crises in everyday life. This is why an element as ubiquitous as cinema plays an essential part.\n\n\u201cI think refugee stories [\u2026] are about identity, about belonging, about home, about loss, about hope and these are all themes that connect us all as humans,\u201d she tells Euronews. \u201c[Films are] an incredibly important channel by which we can share this common humanity and increase tolerance and acceptance among people, all over the world.\u201d\n\nShaden Khallaf, UNHCR Senior Policy Advisor (front) and Thuraya Ismail, humanitarian and social work expert (back) El Gouna Film Festival\n\nDaniela Cicchella, who also works for UNHCR, is another a member of the panel. She heads a project called Telling The Real Story, which focuses on facilitating dialogue within the refugee community.\n\n\"The shift was to talk not about them, but to them,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of communication around but the trust of information is crucial so when the [refugee] community talks to itself through these enhanced forms of dialogue that\u2019s probably the most effective communication,\u201d she tells Euronews.\n\nWith some of the project\u2019s testimonies being adapted to video format, Cicchella explains that close cooperation between filmmakers and displaced communities could have a long-term impact.\n\n\u201cIdeally, if there is an increase in interest from the filmmaking industry about the content of refugees, not only about the refugees but with the refugees to talk about their difficulties and also their resilience and opportunities maybe there is a possibility for change,\u201d she says.\n\nFilmmaker Amin Dora (left) and UNHCR Senior Manager Daniela Cicchella, responsible for the Telling The Real Story project (right) El Gouna Film Festival\n\nRefugee stories, by refugees\n\nThroughout the discussion, members of the panel identified that involving more refugees in the process of filmmaking is key in order to provide more authentic narratives and avoid over-dramatisation.\n\nAccording to Thuraya Ismail, humanitarian and social work expert, cinema audiences are tired of being \u201cemotionally blackmailed\u201d by upsetting stories involving refugees. Instead, she believes their narrative in film should also focus on showing the positive influence they have on their communities, be it socially or economically.\n\nOn the same line of thought, actress and producer Saba Mubarak vows that when films don\u2019t treat refugee narrative with the right approach, the audience ends with an adverse feeling towards them.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be treated as a disease,\u201d she adds.\n\nMubarak starred and co-produced The Guest: Aleppo-Istanbul (2017), where the large majority of cast and crew were refugees and the storyline is based on real facts.\n\nDuring the pre-production phase of the film, Mubarak tried sleeping in the streets and spent 500 hours collecting stories from refugee camps in Turkey.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much we try, we can never put ourselves in their shoes,\u201d she says.\n\nSaba Mubarak, actress and producer El Gouna Film Festival\n\nFilm director Amr Salama also highlights the importance of authenticity in these films and how displaced people should be given the opportunity and encouragement to voice their experiences in film.\n\n\u201cWe see all these films about refugees done by foreigners, of course many of them have good intentions, but they still feel like charity films,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe need to empower people from this region to tell their own stories.\u201d\n\nAs an example, he cites a succession of films made by Palestinian directors that have impressed cinema experts, such as Hany Abu-Assad, who directed Omar (2013) and Paradise Now (2005), and Talal Derki, director of Of Fathers and Sons (2017).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how they\u2019re represented in Cannes, in the Oscars, in the Golden Globes,\u201d says Salama. \u201cOf course, they didn\u2019t solve the world, they didn\u2019t solve the refugee crisis around the world but at least they made a change.\u201d\n\nFilm director Amr Salama (left) and actor Qays Sheikh Najib (right) El Gouna Film Festival\n\nWhy is now the right time for change?\n\nAccording to filmmaker Amin Dora, now is a key moment for refugees to speak up and counter the negative stereotype that their status might carry.\n\nDora believes that with the start of the global refugee crisis, stories seen in the media mostly portrayed hardship. However, with time, he says many were able to integrate and contribute to their new community - and that\u2019s when filmmakers have a new angle to explore.\n\n\u201cWe should now start talking about their achievements, about how they dealt with their situation, going away and making successful stories,\u201d he tells Euronews.\n\nThis idea is not only to give film audiences a fresh perspective but also to help give the refugee community the new start that they need.\n\n\u201c[We should] take those and make them the right example for the rest of the refugees so they can be inspired or they look up and they stop seeing themselves as a dramatic topic all the time.\u201d", "description": "Humanitarians and Arab filmmakers gathered during the 3rd edition of El Gouna Film Festival in Egypt to discuss the cinema industry\u2019s role in refugee crises across the globe.", "authors": ["Ana De Oliva"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/17/67/50/1000x563_cmsv2_c65154bc-64d5-599e-8885-65953d092323-4176750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
