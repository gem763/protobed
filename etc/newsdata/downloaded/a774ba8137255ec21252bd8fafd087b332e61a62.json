'When I see someone pull a gun it makes me angry, it makes me really, really angry.'\n\nLaPierre then restrained the man identified as 30-year-old Tremaine Anderson, seen in pink\n\n'I was going nuts,' he said. 'When I see someone pull a gun it makes me angry, it makes me really, really angry.'\n\nVideo captured the moment LaPierre tussled with the robber and held him against his will by the train doors.\n\nLaPierre managed to pull the gun from the alleged robber's hand in the process as the suspect yelled at him to let go.\n\n'I'm not letting you go! I'm not letting you go! I'm not letting you go!' bellowed LaPierre.\n\nUnbeknownst to Anderson, LaPierre was a Golden Gloves amateur boxer who knew a few moves.\n\n'I'm a boxer. I'll break your head in one punch,' LaPierre could be heard saying in the video.\n\nAnderson attempted to wrestle his way out of LaPierre's hold, but he held firm\n\n'I kept telling him if you move I\u2019m going to knock you out,' he recalled.\n\n'I could hit you seven times in three seconds,' LaPierre boasted, all-the-while holding the man steady.\n\nAt one point he handed the gun over to another commuter and asked her to put the safety on. The bemused rider declared that she had no idea how to do such a thing.\n\nThe suspect, meanwhile, was still determined to try and get away and told LaPierre that he had friends on the train who then tried to intimidate him into letting him go - but he managed to hold him until police arrived.\n\nPolice were soon on board and took Anderson into custody, meanwhile LaPierre went on to run in his 12th Chicago Marathon, pictured\n\n'They started threatening me but I just stood in his face. The guy kept saying to me, \"It's just a gun, let me go, let me go.\" I kept telling him, \"you're not going anywhere,\"' LaPierre said.\n\nAnderson has been charged with one felony count of robbery with a firearm.\n\nAfter the drama was all over, LaPierre, from Boston, went on to run his 12th Chicago Marathon.\n\nDespite the incident on the train, he says that he still loves the Windy City.\n\n'It's one of the best cities I've ever visited. Incidents happen all over. It is what it is, you know?!'
