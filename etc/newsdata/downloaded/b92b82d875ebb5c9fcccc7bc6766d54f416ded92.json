But some students and faculty members say that explanations do not address the full picture of issues at the theological institute.\n\n\u201cThe academic project of the new Institute, approved by the Congregation for Catholic Education, is designed as a widening of reflection on the family, and not as a replacement of themes and topics. Such expansion, showing even more the centrality of the family in the church and in society, confirms and relaunches with new vigor the original and still fruitful intuition of St. John Paul II,\u201d the July 29 press release said.\n\nThe statement aimed to respond to concerns raised by students, alumni, and faculty members of the Institute following the recent approval of its new statutes, or governing documents. The new statutes were called for in 2017, when Pope Francis reestablished the institute, broadening its focus from theology to include \u201cfamily sciences.\u201d\n\nThe Institute was initially founded in 1981 as a center for the study of Christian anthropology and theology, especially in light of the philosophical ideas expressed in Pope St. John Paul II\u2019s \u201cLove and Responsibility,\u201d and the set of his teachings that eventually came to be called the \u201cTheology of the Body.\u201d\n\nWhen Pope Francis legally refounded the Institute two years ago, he said he hoped its work would be \u201cbetter known and appreciated in its fruitfulness and relevance.\u201d\n\nAdding a focus on the social sciences, he said, would be an expansion of \u201cthe field of interest, both in terms of the new dimensions of the pastoral task and the ecclesial mission, as well as in the development of human sciences and the anthropological culture in such a crucial field for the culture of life.\u201d\n\nThe July 29 press release acknowledged that while a chair of fundamental moral theology at the school will no longer exist, changes made to the institute\u2019s curriculum are intended to ensure that \u201cmoral doctrine of marriage and family,\u201d and \u201ctheological ethics of life,\u201d remain a part of the institute\u2019s coursework.\n\nFundamental moral theology is already required in the \u201cfirst cycle\u201d of theological studies required for admission to the Institute\u2019s graduate programs, the press release said.\n\nBut a professor at the Institute told CNA that scholarship in the field of fundamental moral theology has been a long-standing part of the school\u2019s identity, and that other subjects also covered in the first cycle, such as Christian anthropology, remain a part of the Institute\u2019s curriculum.\n\nThe professor, noting that Humanae vitae is not expressly mentioned in the Institute\u2019s new statutes, said that the school\u2019s chair of fundamental moral theology was established at the Institute\u2019s inception, at the insistence of the school\u2019s founder, Pope St. John Paul II.\n\n\u201cIt is important to know that in the old statutes of 2011, based on a few words from Ratzinger about the Institute's contribution to fundamental moral theology, explicit mention of fundamental moral theology was included,\u201d the professor added.\n\nRegarding concerns raised about faculty dismissals, the press release said that because of its partnership with the Pontifical Lateran University, the Institute has reduced its number of course offerings, and therefore not retained some professors, \u201caccording to a policy of consistency and economy.\u201d\n\nSome professors may be eligible for rehire, according to the future faculty needs of the Institute, the press release said.\n\nAmong those no longer included among the Institute\u2019s permanent faculty is Monsignor Livio Melina, who held a chair in fundamental moral theology and served as the Institute\u2019s long-time president. The press release said that Melina would no longer hold a permanent faculty position because the chair in moral theology \u201cno longer exists.\u201d\n\nAlso dismissed is Fr. Jose Noriega, DCJM, a professor of moral theology at the institute.\n\nNoriega is the superior general of the Disciples of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, a Spanish religious community of 24 professed members. The press release said that Noriega could not continue on the faculty because of a provision in canon law which forbids holding two ecclesiastical positions which are \u201cincompatible.\u201d\n\nNoreiga\u2019s term as superior general of the Disciples of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary ends in January 2020.\n\nNoriega has served as superior for 12 years. The priest told CNA that during his years as superior, including three years under the Institute\u2019s current administration, the issue has not been raised to him by anyone at the Institute.\n\nNoriega also said that there is no proof that his faculty position is \u201cincompatible\u201d with a leadership position in his religious community. He noted that during the time he has held both positions, he also served as editorial director of the Institute.\n\nThe press release took issue with reports that a new hiring process will be centralized in the office of the Institute\u2019s Grand Chancellor, Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, noting that \u201cthe appointment of new permanent teachers must be done through an open competition.\u201d\n\nSuch a competition, according to the statutes, is judged by a commission constituted by the institute\u2019s president, a faculty member, and an external member nominated by the Grand Chancellor or a vice-chancellor. Tenured faculty members can veto the commission\u2019s decision by a two-thirds majority.\n\nThe faculty member told CNA that because the chancellor appoints the Institute\u2019s president, the composition of faculty hiring commissions remains subject to his influence and control, noting that only one member of hiring commissions, the one appointed by the faculty, would have independence from the administration\u2019s preferences and intentions.\n\n\u201cAnalysis of the statutes shows that the concentration of power in the hands of the Grand Chancellor is true,\u201d the professor told CNA.\n\nThe June 29 statement also disputed reports that 150 students had signed expressing concern about the direction of the school. The statement said that only a few representatives of the students had signed the letter, which \u201casked for explanations about the innovations taking place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll students were promptly informed of the news and reassured, in accordance with art. 89 of the statutes, about the three-year validity of the old curriculum. Everyone will be given the opportunity to choose between old and new systems and to draft any new plans of study.\u201d\n\nThe faculty member said that while the Institute has told students they may continue in their preferred curriculum, changes to course offerings will make that impossible for those students who wish to continue with the Institute\u2019s traditional theological offerings.\n\nOne of the letter\u2019s organizers told CNA that, to date, 246 students and alumni have added their signatures to the letter through a website set up for that purpose. Organizers say they intend to publish the letter in the coming days.\n\nA student at the Institute, herself among the authors of the letter, told CNA that while students received communication from the Institute\u2019s administrators before they sent their letter, they have received no response to their concerns.\n\n\u201cWe students have expressed our reactions of pain and our request for clarification, addressing the academic authorities, to understand, to know what is going on; to express our support to the professors that have been fired overnight \u2013and it is the time to say it, by an academic institution only because they were spiritual and cultural heirs of John Paul II, only because they believe in the teachings regarding marriage and family from Humanae vitae.\n\n\n\nWith the new order and the new statutes, we don\u2019t have changes that have been shared and agreed upon, but replacements and expulsions. We are witnesses to a true coup d\u2019etat; it is not an integration and alignment of new courses and professors to what already exists and works, but instead the end of an era, with the expulsion of serious and thoughtful persons,\u201d she added.", "description": "", "authors": ["Vatican City", "Jul", "Pm"], "top_image": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Lateran_university.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
