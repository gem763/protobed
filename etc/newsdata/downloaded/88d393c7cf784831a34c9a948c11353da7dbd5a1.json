The pass somehow made its way to Green, who sank the three, as James got back to his feet.\n\nJames also threw a slick bounce pass to Green earlier in the night that would have been his best assist of the game if the shot had not been blocked. Luckily, Anthony Davis was there to clean it up.\n\nThe Lakers are 3-2 in preseason. They kick off the regular season against the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday, October 22.", "description": "LeBron James needed only 25 minutes to rack up 11 assists and an impressive highlight against the Warriors in preseason.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da872a64af909180725e833?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
