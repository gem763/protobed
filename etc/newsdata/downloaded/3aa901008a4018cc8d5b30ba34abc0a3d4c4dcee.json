Some of the largest TAMP providers in the U.S. include Envestnet, SEI and Genworth Wealth Management.\n\nFrom an adviser\u2019s perspective, outsourcing their investment decisions to an institutional firm makes a lot of sense. By moving the direct segregated account management and/or the use of outside managers and ETFs to an outside institution, it streamlines their administrative paperwork and greatly reduces the compliance risk of running in-house proprietary asset management solutions.\n\nMore importantly, it can free up an adviser\u2019s time to focus on financial planning, setting goals-based investment policies and diversifying their total service offering allowing them to scale out their practice. Instead of spending time deciding whether to hold Telus or BCE Inc. in a client portfolio, the adviser can offer much better value by mapping out their client\u2019s specific goals and tracking if they are being met or not.\n\nThis means the client not only will have more productive one-on-one time with their adviser but also a lot more services including in-depth planning that will help with capital growth targets and even perhaps identifying some tax-minimization strategies.\n\nAdditionally, an adviser can high-grade their client\u2019s portfolio via access to some of the best managers globally at a very reasonable price thanks to the pooling of assets with others. In some cases this could include having some alternative and private investment options that were traditionally only available to those with assets over $10 million.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, a TAMP structure can also help during times of excess volatility by having a professional solely dedicated to managing your portfolio.\n\nThis can include timely rebalancing, staying on top of sector and geographic weightings, and identifying and capitalizing upon potential mispricings.\n\nThis strategy has been deployed for years by family offices and multi-family offices and with new technology and fee compression due to ETFs it is finally coming down market to individual investors.\n\nNot surprisingly, the use of TAMPs in the U.S. is exploding higher. According to Tiburon Strategic advisers as cited on Wealthadviser, this year TAMPs are expected to service 4.5 million clients and $3.9 trillion in assets under management and administration which is threefold increase since 2014.\n\nHere in Canada, it is encouraging to see some wealth management firms offering similar turnkey investment solutions to their clients in the form of wrap accounts, or unified managed accounts. Up until recently they were quite expensive but fee compression in both active and passive segments of the market has really helped make these programs become quite an affordable option.\n\nBesides the fees, this TAMP model has faced some resistance in Canada given our brokerage-dominated industry still has roughly one-quarter of its advisers charging under the traditional commission-based non-discretionary model. However, we think this could change as the industry continues to shift towards the fiduciary relationship with clients.\n\nIn conclusion, we like the direction the U.S. wealth management market is moving, especially with the rapid adoption of TAMP solutions. It\u2019s hard to argue against providing clients with institutional level investment management solutions paired with more in-depth financial planning all for the same if not lower price.\n\nMartin Pelletier, CFA is a Portfolio Manager and OCIO at TriVest Wealth Counsel Ltd, a Calgary-based private client and institutional investment firm specializing in discretionary risk-managed portfolios as well as investment audit and oversight services.", "description": "Martin Pelletier: Institutional investment expertise paired with more in-depth financial planning all for the same if not lower price", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/investing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
