MAAL and DPT are not considered the most effective tax regimes, but they are getting some revenue back from corporates that have used structures like the Double Dutch-Irish Sandwich (where companies shift profits to low- or no-tax jurisdictions) to protect their international profits from local taxation.\n\nGoogle's 2017-18 financial accounts reveal Australian advertisers bought $3.7 billion worth of ads, but the company recorded local revenue of just $1.07 billion. That is because Google Australia is considered a reseller of services for the Singapore-based Google Asia-Pacific, despite the revenue coming from Australian businesses.\n\nMr Pichai said Google was committed to engaging with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\n\"We just need a global framework...to me it\u2019s a multilateral trade issue which countries have to resolve and guide multinational countries. Also, the situation is no different than a French company, which is based in France, and sells products globally, where they pay most of their taxes,\" he said.\n\n\"We are happy to evolve the system in a way that works for everyone better, so we have been very supportive of the OECD process. But as a company, we have to comply with the law and we have to work with a certain construct and we have to do this globally at scale.\"\n\nThe OECD is working with the G20 on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) action plan, where 125 countries are collaborating to work out a long-term solution to the challenge of taxation in the digital economy. A final report is due in 2020.\n\n\"I think the best way to do it is through the OECD process. If there are unilateral actions on sectors, each country deciding on that on individual sectors, I think it\u2019s not sustainable and I think it prevents us from creating,\" Mr Pichai said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of value we get as a society from a global shared connected world. It\u2019s the way the internet works and it\u2019s important to make sure it can happen that way. We are strong believers in the OECD process.\"\n\nBut, with so many countries involved, it will be difficult to work out a deal everyone in the OECD will agree to.\n\n\u201cThe problem is when you have 125 countries, or even if you have 27 countries in the EU, given some countries have a vested interest, the possibility of getting an approach agreed upon is virtually zero,\u201d Peter Wells, a professor in the Accounting Discipline Group at the University of Technology Sydney, said.\n\nMr Wells noted strong opposition from Ireland and Luxembourg, who have been accused of being tax havens for companies such as Google and Facebook, on taxation reform in the European Union.\n\nHe said the US will likely oppose OECD proposals because any tax paid internationally will mean less tax repatriated into Google\u2019s home country.\n\nMax Mason travelled to California courtesy of Google", "description": "Australia is one of the many countries where digital giants such as Google, Facebook and Netflix are facing mounting pressure over tax.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/82b2f8cc0a413284a51daff5c946c000fac972e1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
