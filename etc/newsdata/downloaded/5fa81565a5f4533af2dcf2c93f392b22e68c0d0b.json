I didn't know it was going to be that big,\" she said.\n\nThe cherry on top of the day was when Sydney got to meet Princess Tiana herself.\n\n\"She was really happy to see somebody wearing her own dress and I told her all the things we have in common,\" Sydney told \"GMA.\" \"I told her that I love to bake, my favorite color is green and we're both black.\"\n\nAnother trait that Sydney and Princess Tiana have in common is they're both dedicated to their passion. Sydney is an actress, dancer and singer who has a website dedicated to her performances.\n\nHer mother shared that parents \"really [should] try to find ways to help them explore their passions, whether it's taking classes or doing field trips.\"\n\n\"Whatever it happens to be, that helps them explore those things now, and kind of find their identity and what they love now, because you never know what it is that you're sparking in your child,\" she said.\n\nSydney also shared her advice for others when it comes to pursuing their dreams: \"If you want to do something, just go for it.\"\n\nDisney is the parent company of ABC News and \"Good Morning America.\"", "description": "Sydney Elise Russell, 8, dressed as Princess Tiana and wowed a crowd at Walt Disney World when she started dancing.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/tiana-dancing-ht-jt-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
