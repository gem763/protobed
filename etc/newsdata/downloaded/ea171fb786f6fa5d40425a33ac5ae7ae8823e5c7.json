Leaving crimes against grammar aside, this was a significant couple of sentences. Despite cosying up to Nigel Farage in public more than once (including at a recent rally), Trump rarely attempts to involve himself in the actual intricacies of Brexit or the British parliamentary system. To namedrop Jeremy Corbyn and a no-confidence vote in one tweet shows that Boris must have made a significant impression on the US president during the recent G7 summit, despite having previously called The Donald \u201cunfit for office\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that Trump is a sucker for flattery \u2013 and that Johnson can build a convincing argument for something even after publicly supporting the other side (see: Brexit). The two leaders looked chummy in pictures taken in Biarritz on the weekend, and talks of a \u201cgreat trade deal\u201d between the US and UK have abounded. Johnson may be using his talents with language and diplomacy to get America on-side in the event of a damaging crash-out from the EU; or he may be preparing to sell the NHS and other public services to nefarious American contractors at knockdown prices. At this point, it\u2019s simply impossible to know. But one thing\u2019s for certain: Trump has warmed to our new prime minister much more than he ever did to Theresa May, and is less than pleased about the idea that Jeremy Corbyn might replace him any time soon.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNumerous political commentators have drawn comparisons between the two blonds in DC and Downing Street since BoJo won the Conservative leadership contest. These comparisons were, of course, encouraged by Trump himself when he claimed that people in the UK refer to Johnson as \u201cBritain Trump\u201d. The two men share more than just a hairstyle, for sure, but Johnson is much more concerned with appearing traditionally prime-ministerial. You won\u2019t find him tweeting about \u201cfake news\u201d from a personal Twitter account, or calling his opponents \u201clow-IQ losers\u201d.\n\nIt did, however, feel like Boris had taken a leaf out of Donald Trump\u2019s book when he asked the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks ahead of the Brexit deadline yesterday. This is the sort of colouring-outside-the-lines democracy Trump has a real penchant for: it\u2019s not quite against the rules, but many would argue it\u2019s against the spirit of the law. Like Donald Trump \u201cjoking\u201d that he might run for unlimited terms, Boris Johnson is flirting with danger here. Both might argue they\u2019re just trying to \u201cget the job done\u201d and doing it in a way that merely upsets the establishment, but the UK is not the US \u2013 and a \u201cBritain Trump\u201d who refuses to play by parliamentary rules might not go down as well in middle England as his counterpart does in middle America. Indeed, even in middle America, patience seems to be wearing thin.\n\nJohnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament looks like it might be a strategy ahead of a general election, wherein he will position himself as the only Brexit believer against a catalogue of cross-party naysayers. Likewise, Trump is in full election mode, having launched his official 2020 presidential campaign a few weeks ago. Both will likely use a close relationship with the other as evidence of the respect and power they command on the world stage. If their gambles don\u2019t pay off, however, I can\u2019t imagine Boris will get a post-2020 invite to the now-notorious Trump resort in Doral, Florida. This friendship is based on mutual gain, and when that collapses, little love will be lost between these two unconventional leaders.\n\nYours,\n\nHolly Baxter\n\nOpinion editor (US)", "description": "With Brexit raging on one side of the Atlantic and 2020 campaigns raging on the other, it\u2019s not often we get a UK/US crossover episode these days \u2013 but it happened this week, when Donald Trump waded in on the latest controversy surrounding Boris Johnson.", "authors": ["Holly Baxter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/12/16/boris-trump-splash.jpg"}
