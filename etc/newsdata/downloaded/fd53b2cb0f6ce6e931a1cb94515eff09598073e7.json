The sanctions handed down by the NCAA also included a reduction in scholarships, limits on recruiting and a fine of $5,000 plus 2% of the program's budget \u2014 a major blow to Pastner's efforts to rebuild the struggling Atlantic Coast Conference program.\n\nThen-Georgia Tech assistant coach Darryl LaBarrie gestures during the first half of an NCAA basketball game in Atlanta. AP\n\nJoel Maturi, the chief hearing officer for the NCAA's committee on infractions, said the penalties could have been more severe.\n\n\"Quite frankly, if you look at the penalties that were prescribed, they are ... in most cases at the lower level of level one standards,\" Maturi said. \"We're trying to be as fair and consistent as we can.\"\n\nCBS Sports reports another major violation came when a separate booster provided impermissible benefits to a potential transfer student-athlete that included thousands of dollars worth of shoes, lodging, clothing, transportation and meals.\n\nGeorgia Tech athletic director Todd Stansbury said in a statement the school is considering a possible appeal.\n\n\"While we regret that these violations have occurred and appreciate the NCAA committee on infractions' work on this case, we are disappointed with the severity of the penalties imposed, some of which will have a direct and unfair impact on current student-athletes,\" Stansbury said in a statement. \"We are exploring our options and giving serious consideration on whether to appeal some aspects of the decision.\"\n\nThe postseason ban seems largely symbolic. The Yellow Jackets haven't appeared in the NCAA tournament since 2010 and made their last postseason appearance in 2017, during Pastner's first season at Georgia Tech. The postseason ban also includes the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. Pastner is 48-53 at Georgia Tech entering his fourth season with the Yellow Jackets.", "description": "The NCAA says the punishment stems from major recruiting violations committed by a former assistant coach", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/26/532facc1-64d2-4c66-a418-a2876ff977a9/thumbnail/1200x630g2/1ebdd3af563caa24a4d8e047c9411828/darryl-labarrie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
