But the forum has been criticised over its inaction, and before the May election the government quietly postponed fuel standard improvements for Australian refiners until 1 July 2027, in line with the petroleum industry\u2019s demand.\n\nThe trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the issue of Australia\u2019s fuel standards would be considered as part of the bilateral negotiations.\n\n\u201cAs part of the free trade negotiations we will consider everything that is put on the table. Whether we agree to it is a different matter,\u201d Birmingham told Guardian Australia.\n\n\u201cIt is not Australian practice to simply adopt European standards \u2013 we urge and encourage common adoption of international standards where possible.\n\n\u201cBut we will work through in a practical way any of these issues and see what may be possible in the Australian context, but ultimately we will only be doing any agreement if it is in the overall benefit of Australia.\u201d\n\nOn the likelihood that Australia\u2019s commitment to the Paris climate agreement will need to be enshrined in the new FTA, Birmingham said Australia would be happy to comply.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to Paris is firm and resolute and we are happy to reinforce that commitment in any forum.\u201d\n\nAlong with industrial and environmental concerns, Australia and the EU are attempting to negotiate through a host of agricultural barriers, with Australian farmers hoping to gain further access to Europe\u2019s highly protected market.\n\nTariffs on imported lamb and beef to the EU are as high as 50%, but Europe is considering a boost to the low tariff quota allowed to Australian exporters for high-quality produce.\n\nEurope is pushing for Australian action on so-called \u201cgeographic indicators\u201d, which would prevent Australian producers using a suite of brand names it deems to be its intellectual property, such as feta, gruyere and gorgonzola.\n\nAustralian cheesemakers have expressed concern that the proposed ban on product names could require expensive rebranding and cost jobs.\n\nAsked about the progress being made on the FTA, negotiations for which began in June 2018, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said it was \u201ccomplex\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is just step by step by step by step,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a real keenness to engage with Australia.\u201d", "description": "The European Union wants Australia\u2019s Paris climate commitments enshrined in new FTA", "authors": ["Sarah Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc6858a610522912bbdb5060c05e5da90ff7c66/92_0_4217_2531/master/4217.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=520b6ad99d257a94e781a14efdde89ef"}
