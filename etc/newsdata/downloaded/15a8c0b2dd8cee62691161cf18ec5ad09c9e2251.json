But the 21-year-old did not die on a military mission or in combat.\n\nRather, on Aug. 1, 2018, he was killed in a hit-and-run crash after an SUV plowed into him and his friend as they were fixing the sports car they\u2019d been riding in after it broke down along the side of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge near National Harborin Maryland.\n\nOn Monday, the driver convicted of killing Guerreiro and fleeing the scene, John David Mueller Jr., 33, was sentenced to 14 years and six months in prison \u2014 a punishment more than five years above the maximum recommended in state guidelines.\n\n\n\nChristian Anthony Guerreiro (Family photo)\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Circuit Court Judge Robin D. Gill Bright said she issued a harsher sentence in the criminally negligent manslaughter case because Mueller hit the two men and then left them on the bridge \u201cbleeding in desperate need of help.\u201d\n\nMueller, of Hollywood, Md., had driven off after crashing into Guerreiro and a surviving victim, Ryan Eades, who was then 20, Prince George\u2019s County Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Jennifer Rush said. When Mueller\u2019s car later broke down, he ran and eventually jumped into the Potomac River to flee, Rush said. Maryland State Police found him hours later shirtless and wet not far from the crash site, Rush said.\n\nMueller stood up in court and apologized for \u201cthe loss of Christian\u201d and said he hoped to earn forgiveness one day. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the feelings everyone is having in this room,\u201d he said.\n\nThe crash came after a history of drunken driving and charges for Mueller, Rush said before his sentencing. He had been convicted of driving under the influence in 2011 and 2006 and had a prior hit-and-run conviction in 2008, Rush said.\n\nBefore the judge issued her sentence, Mueller\u2019s attorney, Jeremy B. Widder, said he and his client were limited in what they could say about the case due to possible appeals but said it was inappropriate for the punishment to go above the recommended maximum.\n\nProsecutors had tried to convince a jury that Mueller was drunk at the time of the crash, but because his blood was not drawn in a timely manner, they could not prove he was driving under the influence, Guerreiro\u2019s family said outside the courtroom.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Rush said that at trial, Mueller\u2019s defense had suggested that prosecutors could not prove their client was drunk at the time and that the defense claimed he had fled because he was confused by the deployment of his air bag.\n\n\u201cIf he was not drunk, leaving the scene of an accident like this is much worse,\u201d Rush said to the judge Monday.\n\nIn court, Rush said \u201cdue to missteps\u201d by Maryland State Police, prosecutors could not prove that Mueller was drunk.\n\nMaryland State Police said in an interview that troopers cannot draw someone\u2019s blood without a search warrant secured with the help of prosecutors. \u201cAlthough they could smell alcohol, they could not draw his blood on account of not reaching the assistant state\u2019s attorney,\u201d Maryland State Police spokeswoman Brenda Carl said of Mueller\u2019s case. \u201cYou have to get the search warrant, and you have to get a judge to sign off. The attempts were made.\u201d\n\nIn response to the state police explanation, Denise Roberts, a spokeswoman for Prince George\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney Aisha N. Braveboy, said the agency has been working to more effectively prosecute these types of cases since Braveboy took office in December 2018.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t speak to the process that was in place prior,\u201d Roberts said, but now attorneys prosecuting motor vehicle manslaughter cases are involved earlier in the process.\n\nJorge Guerreiro said he wished Mueller had pleaded guilty instead of putting the family through the pain of a four-day trial, further wounding the grieving family.\n\nChele Eades, the mother of survivor Ryan Eades, said her son is also in the Navy but could not attend the sentencing because he is overseas.\n\nOf Mueller, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that man can feel the intensity of our pain.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nD.C. man accused of strangling a man in dispute over towing fee\n\nDel.
