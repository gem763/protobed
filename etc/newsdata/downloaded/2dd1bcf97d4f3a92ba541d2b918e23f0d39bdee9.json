Ripken rejected the defense motion for sanctions at a pretrial hearing Friday. Ripken said prosecutors exercised \u201cdue diligence\u201d and had not committed any discovery violations.\n\nAD\n\nRamos, 39, has pleaded not criminally responsible in the June 28, 2018, shooting at the newspaper offices, which killed five: editorial page editor Gerald Fischman, 61; assistant editor Rob Hiaasen, 59; sportswriter, reporter and editor John McNamara, 56; sales assistant Rebecca Smith, 34; and reporter Wendi Winters, 65.\n\nHis trial is set to begin Nov. 4.\n\nRamos\u2019s public defenders have argued that a \u201cmental disorder\u201d prevented him from following the law, but prosecutors say he plotted the shooting at the newspaper\u2019s office to settle a long-standing grudge after the Capital published a column about his guilty plea in the harassment of his former high school classmate.\n\nAD\n\nThe materials that the defense team said prosecutors failed to turn over include information from a 2013 investigation of complaints that Ramos had threatened newspaper staff and others involved in his losing defamation case he filed against the newspaper after the column about his harassment case was published.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe state has failed to meet or exercise due diligence,\u201d said Katy O\u2019Donnell, one of Ramos\u2019s three public defenders.\n\nLeitess countered that materials sought by the defense either didn\u2019t exist in law enforcement records or had already been provided in a different form.\n\nThe 2013 messages Ramos sent to lawyers and the newspaper, which prompted the complaints to law enforcement , were threatening and rude but did not constitute a crime, Leitess said. Moreover, newspaper officials had said they didn\u2019t want to press charges against Ramos, fearing it would further incite him, she said.\n\nAD\n\nThreats that Ramos made on social media against the Capital Gazette and lawyers involved in the defamation suit he filed were part of a strategy of intimidation and harassment, prosecutors said.\n\nAt an earlier pretrial hearing, Leitess said Ramos reportedly told his sister, \u201cI want them to think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d after she asked him why he posted intimidating and harassing messages on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nIn other pretrial activity, attorneys for both sides are in the process of developing questions to be asked of potential jurors during the three-day selection process set to start Oct. 30.\n\nThe judge said Friday that 322 potential jurors have filled out questionnaires as part of a preliminary screening process to streamline jury selection. Potential jurors were required to come to the courthouse in late September to fill out the questionnaire.\n\nAD", "description": "Defense attorneys had accused prosecutors of failing to turn over evidence, but a judge ruled there were no discovery violations.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/80_UuzJh5Da20ykC7-7cm2x0F9Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FJ3JJMXEPII6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
