The companies, with a combined market capitalisation of almost $91 billion at the mid-year, account for about a fifth of China\u2019s power and emitted nearly 3% of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide in 2017, according to ARE.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s large listed power companies are struggling to take meaningful steps on the transition to cleaner energy,\u201d ARE said in the report. \u201cForeign investors find it harder to justify holding shares.\u201d\n\nThe six didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment amid a holiday in mainland China.\n\nThe power industry globally is under pressure to cut carbon emissions amid climate change concerns, with coal\u2019s use under particular scrutiny as it\u2019s the most polluting. The fuel has divided policy makers, sparked a retreat from top miners such as Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group, and prompted lenders including Standard Chartered and HSBC Holdings to slash financing for new coal projects.\n\nThough China has added more solar and wind power capacity than any other country and sets clear targets for green energy use, it mines and burns about half the world\u2019s coal, which still meets about 60% of the nation\u2019s total energy needs.\n\nA key challenge for the firms, according to ARE, is that broader carbon and pollution goals dictated by President Xi Jinping\u2019s government are pursued by larger state-owned parents across all business units, of which the listed companies on average represent only 35% of total capacity.\n\nEfforts to reduce air pollution, greenhouse gases or waste of renewable power \u201coften apply across the entire portfolio not just for the listed entities,\u201d according to ARE report authors, Benjamin McCarron and Xinying Tok. \u201cConsequently, the parent companies will seek to set strategy at the level of the whole portfolio.\u201d\n\nFor example, the parent companies of Datang International Power Generation Co. and Huaneng Power International Inc. have already spun off the main renewable power assets into separate units earlier this decade, which\u201cconstrains strategic options for investors\u201d in the coal-dominated firms.\n\nUnder pressure\n\nChina Shenhua Energy Co. was singled out by ARE for not providing 2018 greenhouse gas emissions data or listing climate change as a material issue. The company is almost exclusively coal-powered and hasn\u2019t added wind or solar generation, ARE said. By contrast, China Resources Power Holdings Co. shows the strongest transition to renewable energy and the fastest decline in coal use.\n\nThe remaining Hong Kong-listed companies analyzed in the ARE report are Huadian Power International Corp. and China Power International Development Ltd. Four of the six are dual-listed in Shanghai.\n\nThe companies all have higher proportions of coal in their power mix than the national target, which will act as a long-term constraint to growth, according to ARE. And while wind and solar represented 7.8% of China\u2019s total generation last year, it only averaged 3.7% for the six majors.\n\n\u201cInternational investors are under pressure to reduce exposure to coal,\u201d ARE said in the report. \u201cWithout a transition pathway to generating portfolios with cleaner characteristics the companies will face increasing challenges in marketing their shares internationally.\u201d", "description": "China\u2019s top six listed coal-power generators are failing to respond to climate change, lagging international peers and leaving them misaligned with Beijing\u2019s broader environmental policies, according to a sustainability and governance risk consultant.", "authors": ["Jasmine Ng"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8617/c605983e80fb45be8ef76ce3475cf4bf.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
