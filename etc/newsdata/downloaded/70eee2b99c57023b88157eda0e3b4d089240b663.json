Concrete will now be poured around the base of the roughly 1,000-ton structure.\n\nThe lighthouse is 76 feet tall and sits atop a cliff 200 feet above sea level.\n\nCrowds gathered to watch the lighthouse be moved on Tuesday.

Ole Jensen/Getty Images\n\nWhen it first went into service in 1900, it was roughly 656 feet from the shore. But steady erosion meant that, by the time the move started on Tuesday morning, it was only about 19.5 feet away.\n\nDenmark's environment ministry spent 5 million kroner ($747,000) to save the building, which officials say would otherwise have to have been dismantled. Environment Minister Lea Wermelin has called the white, square lighthouse \"a national treasure.\"\n\nLocal mayor Arne Boelt and the town of Hjoerring also chipped in to foot the bill.\n\nRead more: You can now sleep inside a lighthouse turned into a luxury hotel on a remote Spanish island\n\nThe lighthouse is pictured above around 2003.

The lighthouse, however, still gets more than 250,000 visitors each year.\n\nThe move was broadcast live on major Danish news outlets.\n\nIn 2008, a nearby church was dismantled to prevent it from falling into the sea. The Romanesque Maarup Church, built on a cliff around 1250, was picked for scenes in \"Babette's Feast,\" which in 1987 became the first Danish film to win the Oscar for best foreign language film.", "description": "When it was first constructed, the Rubjerg Knude lighthouse was 656 feet from the shore.
