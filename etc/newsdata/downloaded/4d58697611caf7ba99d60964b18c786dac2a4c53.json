Great driving.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe Brit now leads Bottas by 64 points with just 104 to play for in the remaining four races of the season and a sixth world championship could be wrapped up by the next round in Mexico.\n\nA frosty Hamilton said after the race: \"Firstly it's congratulations to the team to win it six times in a row. I really just wanted to get the best points for the team.\"\n\nFor Bottas, it was a morale-boosting victory after a dreadful run of form that has seen his team-mate spearhead all-conquering Mercedes' challenge for another remarkable title crown.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe combination of Bottas and Hamilton\u2019s finishes, plus Ferrari\u2019s failure to improve on their second and sixth place with Vettel and Charles Leclerc, means a Mercedes driver is guaranteed to win the drivers\u2019 title.\n\nIt breaks the record of five title doubles set by Michael Schumacher and Ferrari from 2000-2004 and confirms this dominant Mercedes team as the greatest in Formula One history.\n\nBottas said: \"I'm happy, very happy. Obviously it was a close qualifying and starting third is not easy here but you don't give up and anything is possible.\n\n\"I had a really nice start and Sebastian had an issue so I got the lead and the pace was super good. I enjoyed it and had fun.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIndeed, Bottas seemingly had the win wrapped up at the first corner after Vettel\u2019s alleged false start, for which he was found not guilty, and Leclerc\u2019s slow start off the line.\n\nLeclerc\u2019s misery was compounded following an early collision with Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and although he came home sixth, he faces an investigation for that incident.\n\nAnother day to savour for Mercedes, another one to forget for Ferrari.", "description": "Bottas becomes just the third Mercedes driver to win the Japanese GP", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569556.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AUTO-PRIX-JPN-F1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
