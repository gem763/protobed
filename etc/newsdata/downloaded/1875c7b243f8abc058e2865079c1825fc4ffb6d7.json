The Mail on Sunday has denied the accusation.\n\nAt the time, Prince Harry said the way newspapers were treating Markle was reminiscent of their approach to his mother, Princess Diana, and accused some sections of the British media of \"bullying\" his wife, who last week was named among the most influential black people in the UK.\n\n\"Though this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one. Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself,\" the prince said in a statement on October 1.\n\n\"I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,\" he added.\n\nPrince Harry said the couple believed in \"media freedom and objective, truthful reporting\", describing it as a \"cornerstone of democracy\", but accused parts of the media of publishing \"relentless propaganda\".\n\n\"Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences - a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son,\" he said.\n\nIn May, a BBC journalist was fired for using a picture of a chimpanzee in a Twitter post about the royal couple's newborn son.", "description": "Cross-party group of female legislators slam UK press for publishing stories containing 'outdated, colonial undertones'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/00e3202555ea481186c74a974b41feb7_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
