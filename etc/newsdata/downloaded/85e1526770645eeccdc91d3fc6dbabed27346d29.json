They just, you know, spilt money everywhere in panic and crisis. And I don't think that's what the Australian people voted for.\n\n\"They want us to listen carefully to what the needs are and to respond to them in a very careful way, not blowing money, not raising people's taxes to put up welfare bills and all that sort of stuff.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLabor slams 'cowardice'\n\nIn Parliament, Labor tried for a second day in succession to suspend proceedings and bring on a debate about the economy. The government used its numbers to block the move, prompting allegations of cowardice from the Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese and shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers.\n\n\"He ran from the issue,\" they said in a statement. \"He is ashamed of his economic record and he should be. Mr Morrison has no plan to stimulate our nation's sluggish economy and is so out of touch and arrogant that he believes he is above the scrutiny of the Parliament and Australia.''\n\nOne senior source suggested there was some policy work being done in the background should the tax cuts, which were rolled out on July 1, as well as the interest rate cuts in June and July, fail to lift growth in the September quarter and require stimulus in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) statement.\n\nBut the work was low key and had not yet reached the level of the Expenditure Review Committee, otherwise known as the budget razor gang, which prepares polices for the mid-year and May budget.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg has already flagged the inclusion in the May budget of a Labor-style investment guarantee to stimulate business investment.\n\nHe was coy on Wednesday when asked whether this policy could be brought forward to MYEFO if necessary.", "description": "A small drop in the unemployment rate has stiffened the government's resolve to not bring forward economic stimulus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3333%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_429%2C$y_31/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a3af8cc7de11fbab254d9dadbf6f1bed7c005ca1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
