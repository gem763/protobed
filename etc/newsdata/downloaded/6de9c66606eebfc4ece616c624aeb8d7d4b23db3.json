It did not support the plantations of Virginia and the Deep South, but it was bound to slavery both as a business partner and as a practitioner. Colonial New Yorkers made rum out of Caribbean sugar. Small farmers and artisans before and after the American Revolution employed slave laborers. The wealthy were attended by enslaved servants. An English visitor to Robert Livingston\u2019s Hudson River estate, eager to meet a transatlantic man of enlightened views, was surprised to find himself being served at meals by barefoot black boys wearing fine embroidered coats. The first post-independence census would count 21,193 slaves in New York, out of a total population of 314,366 (there were 4,682 free blacks). Local newspapers statewide were dotted with ads offering to buy or sell slaves and with inquiries after runaway property. For example, from the Albany Centinel: \u201cTwenty Dollars Reward [for] a Negro Woman, named BETT, with her two children: She stole away and carried away a large Cheese, a number of silver Tea spoons, and several other articles. . . . Also, RAN AWAY, About two months since, a Negro Man, named BILL, or WILL [who] induced the abovementioned Negro Woman, (whom he calls his wife), to go off with him, so that it is probable they will be found together.\u201d More slaves lived in New York City than in any other American city except Charleston.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn January 25, 1785, nineteen New Yorkers met in the house of John Simmons, innkeeper. The American Revolution had been particularly harsh on New York, which the British had conquered in the grim fall of 1776. Washington\u2019s prudent generalship, and the help of Britain\u2019s longtime enemy France, had won victory by 1781. Yet the enemy had not evacuated the city until the end of 1783. A third of it had burned; all its trees had been cut for firewood. Commerce had only just revived.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe men gathering at Simmons\u2019s house looked to a civic and moral revival. Most of those present were Quakers, many of them interrelated. Robert and Thomas Bowne were descended from an old Quaker family in Flushing. John Murray Sr. and Jr. gave their name to a hill north of the city. Elijah Cock, Effingham and Lawrence Embree, Samuel Franklin, John and William Keese, Edward and Joseph Lawrence, Willet Seaman, and William Shotwell were additional Friends, as Quakers were known. Others in attendance were veterans \u2014 James Cogswell, William Goforth, Melancton Smith, and Robert Troup. The meeting was called to order by Troup, a 28-year-old lawyer who had been both a British prisoner of war and a general\u2019s aide at one of America\u2019s great victories, Saratoga. Troup was an amiable young man whom everybody liked; one friend would call him \u201ca better antidote to the spleen than a ton of drugs.\u201d This January meeting had the serious purpose of forming a \u201cSociety for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves, and Protecting such of them as have been or may be Liberated.\u201d\n\nIn the chaos of the American Revolution, many slaves in and around New York had freed themselves simply by disappearing. Slave catchers, known as man-stealers or blackbirders, hunted for runaways and scooped up free blacks if authentic runaways were not to be found. In November 1784, city authorities had foiled an attempt to spirit away a group of free blacks on a ship bound for either Charleston or the Bay of Honduras.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was the immediate stimulus for the New Yorkers to meet, but they had larger ends in view. A committee of five \u2014 Embree, Franklin, Murray Sr., Smith, and Troup \u2014 was appointed to draw up the society\u2019s regulations and bylaws for approval at the next meeting, February 4. This time the society met at the Merchant\u2019s Coffee House, the city\u2019s largest. This was a larger meeting, attended by George Clinton, James Duane, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese were ornaments of the New York elite. George Clinton, an upstate landowner and speculator, was the state\u2019s first post-independence governor, now serving his third term (he would serve four more, earning the nickname \u201cOld Incumbent\u201d). James Duane, who had married into the Livingston clan, was New York City\u2019s first post-occupation mayor. John Jay, another Livingston in-law, had been a Revolutionary spymaster, diplomat, and politician who had helped write the state\u2019s constitution. Alexander Hamilton was the newcomer to this group: He was the same age as Robert Troup and had roomed with him at King\u2019s College, later Columbia, before the American Revolution. Like Troup, he had served in the war, though in a loftier position: George Washington had tapped him to be a colonel on his staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe list of attendees reflected a unique political moment. New York\u2019s political vanguard (loyalists having been driven into exile or hiding) had led a successful revolution. In the years to come, they would split into hostile parties: Jay and Hamilton on one side, contending with Clinton and Melancton Smith (Jay and Clinton would run against each other for governor twice, each of them winning once). But now a united elite joined with Quakers \u2014 always outsiders, pursuing their own goals \u2014 in a common cause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe society\u2019s bylaws began with a preamble, probably written by Troup, stating its goals and its inspiration. It included two sentences on the immediate crisis, the depredation of slave catchers: \u201cThe violent attempts lately made to seize and export for sale, several free Negroes, who were peaceably following their respective occupations, in this city must excite the indignation of every friend to humanity, and ought to receive exemplary punishment. . . . Destitute of friends and of knowledge, struggling with poverty, and accustomed to submission, [free blacks] are under great disadvantages in asserting their rights.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first efforts of the society, then, would be directed to preventing black New Yorkers from being enslaved elsewhere. Man-stealing, a southbound underground railroad, was a monstrous practice, well worth stopping. Campaigning to stop it also conveniently focused attention on evil masters somewhere else (the luckless free negroes were seized for export). This smacked of an always popular form of charity: charity at a distance. The owners of Bett and Bill, advertising in the Albany Centinel, need not be concerned.\n\nThe opening of the preamble, however, was both more comprehensive and more specific: It addressed an all-American problem, focusing particularly on New Yorkers. The language echoed and amplified that of the Declaration of Independence: \u201cThe benevolent Creator and Father of men, having given to them all an equal right to life, liberty, and property, no Sovereign power on earth can justly deprive them of either; but in conformity to impartial government and laws to which they have expressly or tacitly consented.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Thomas Jefferson, the society invoked the Creator. But its Creator was more personal \u2014 not nature\u2019s God but a benevolent Father. Its villain was not George III but any unjust sovereign power. That would include unjust power that had been elected; that might include America.\n\nThe society shared Jefferson\u2019s emphasis on consent. Punishment could be justly administered only by governments to which men had \u201cexpressly or tacitly\u201d given theirs. (\u201cTacitly\u201d was added to include persons \u2014 women and children \u2014 who did not vote.)\n\nThe preamble went on: \u201cIt is our duty, therefore, both as free Citizens and Christians, not only to regard with compassion, the injustice done to those among us who are held as slaves; but to endeavour, by lawful ways and means, to enable them to share equally with us, in that civil and religious Liberty, with which an indulgent providence has blessed these States, and to which these our brethren are, by nature, as much entitled as ourselves.\u201d\n\nThis sentence is not as elegant or as dense as Jefferson at his best, but there is a lot packed in it. It is a political and religious duty (\u201cas free citizens and Christians\u201d) not just \u201cto regard\u201d but \u201cto endeavour.\u201d To act, not just to sympathize. \u201cBy lawful ways and means\u201d could be a counsel of conservatism: working within the laws as they now exist. But it could also be a counsel of activism: changing the laws to better suit our goal, which is enabling slaves \u201cto share equally with us\u201d in liberty. Why do we have such a goal? Because \u201cour brethren\u201d are \u201cas much entitled [to it] as ourselves.\u201d All men are created equal.\n\nChristianity suffuses the entire preamble. As God is a father, so men are brethren. America is free because \u201can indulgent providence\u201d has \u201cblessed\u201d it. To be sure, Americans had won their liberty by fighting for it; the veterans at the Merchant\u2019s Coffee House had fought, personally. But their efforts had been secured by providence. The preamble, meanwhile, does not neglect enlightened philosophy: Slaves are entitled to liberty \u201cby nature.\u201d\n\nThe preamble\u2019s echoing of words in the Declaration of Independence \u2014 equal, consented, life, liberty \u2014 are not borrowings from it but terms taken from the same source used by Jefferson: the common stock of American political ideas. Troup was not writing out of his head; he and Jefferson both were writing out of America\u2019s head.\n\nStill, there are important differences between the society\u2019s preamble and the Declaration. Slavery, an embarrassment so glaring that it had to be brushed aside in 1776, takes center stage in 1785 alongside the benevolent Father \u2014 no longer an adjunct of nature but a person and a personality \u2014 Who wishes that it be done away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the preamble, the bylaws set the dues \u2014 eight shillings, or a dollar, to join, four shillings every quarter to stay a member \u2014 and called for elected officers. At the next meeting John Jay was elected president.\n\nJay, a descendant of wealthy merchants, was a hard-headed man. One of his wartime assignments had been to run the state\u2019s Committee for Detecting Conspiracies; revolutionary-era New York was a dark ground of conflicting loyalties. \u201cPunishments,\u201d Jay wrote, \u201cmust of course become certain, and Mercy dormant, a harsh System repugnant to my Feelings, but nevertheless necessary.\u201d As a diplomat, he had remarked that treaties were valid only so far as they reflected the interests of the parties; otherwise, they \u201chad never signified anything since the world began.\u201d\n\nJay\u2019s best portraits, however, show a face marked by acquaintance with grief. He was the grandson of a Huguenot refugee; two of his siblings had been blinded by smallpox, and two others suffered from mental problems.\n\nHe was sincerely committed to the gradual abolition of slavery. He wanted language approving such a goal included in the constitution he had helped write for New York State in 1777: \u201cThe rights of human nature and the principles of our holy religion loudly call upon us to dispense the blessings of freedom to all mankind.\u201d The proposed language was voted down. In a letter written three years later, he stated that until America adopted such a measure, \u201cher prayers to Heaven for liberty will be impious. This is a strong expression,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it is just.\u201d\n\nYet Jay himself owned five slaves. He bought them, he said, in order to free them, once they had worked off their purchase price, thrift tracking charity; he calculated that Benoit, a slave he bought in 1779, would earn his freedom by 1787. Jay was not the only slave-owning member of the society: Troup owned two.\n\nTroup tried to resolve the anomaly via that favorite recourse of small-group politicians, a committee. At the society\u2019s February 1785 meeting, he was assigned to a committee of three members, along with Hamilton and White Matlack, a silversmith who had been expelled from the Quakers for his too-zealous support of the American Revolution. The committee\u2019s mandate was \u201cto Report a Line of conduct to be recommended to the Members of the Society in relation to any Slaves possessed by them.\u201d\n\nAt the society\u2019s November 1785 meeting, the Troup committee presented four resolutions. \u201cAll slaves\u201d age 28 or younger \u201cwho shall be owned by any of the members of this Society\u201d should be freed when they turned 35; all slaves older than 28 and younger than 38 should be freed \u201cwithin seven years of the present time\u201d; all other slaves should be freed when they turned 45, those who were now that age or older to be freed \u201cimmediately\u201d; and finally, members should not sell any slaves except on the condition that their purchasers agree to adopt this schedule of manumission.\n\nThese recommendations struck the rest of the society as too bold, and they were killed by that other favorite recourse of small-group politicians, another committee. Troup\u2019s report was assigned to a second committee for reconsideration; that committee dragged its heels until November 1787, when it was dissolved at its own request. The manumission of the Manumission Society\u2019s slaves would be left, at least in the short run, to the initiative of members.\n\nOne thing the society did do, as early as May 1786, was begin planning for a school in the city to educate the children of \u201cpoor Africans.\u201d In its very first meeting, the society had noted that free blacks fell easier prey to man-stealers because they were \u201cdestitute . . . of knowledge.\u201d Education would make them better able to defend their rights.\n\nThe African Free School was opened for boys in 1787; girls were admitted five years later. All were taught reading, writing, and arithmetic; girls were taught needlework, boys astronomy needed for navigation. Both sexes were enjoined to avoid \u201cimmorality,\u201d \u201cidleness,\u201d and \u201cfiddling, dancing or any noisy entertainments in their houses.\u201d In 1797 an evening school was added for adults. By the time it was folded into the public school system in the 1830s, the African Free School had seven branches scattered across the city.\n\nProtecting free blacks was important (the society also compiled a list of them, against which the victims of man-stealing could be checked). But liberating slaves required political action. The society successfully petitioned the state legislature to achieve small but crucial reforms: forbidding new slaves to be brought into the state or current slaves taken out of it; freeing the slaves of exiled loyalists that the state government had confiscated as punishment. Finally, in 1799, Governor John Jay, serving his second term, signed an act for the gradual abolition of slavery. Slave children born after July 4 that year were to be freed after 28 years (for males) or 25 years (for females). Eighteen years later a new law mandated that all slavery in the state would end by July 4, 1827.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York\u2019s slowness in ridding itself of slavery has cast the New-York Manumission Society into retrospective disrepute. Scholars sniff at its gradualism. Every other northern state except New Jersey had begun the process of abolition, or completed it, before the Manumission Society was even founded. Massachusetts ended slavery at a stroke by a decision of its state supreme court in 1783; Pennsylvania passed a gradual emancipation law in 1780, New Hampshire in 1783, Connecticut and Rhode Island in 1784; Vermont never had any slaves to begin with. The society\u2019s willingness to dispense lifestyle advice to its charges in the African Free School \u2014 no fiddling or dancing at home \u2014 seems paternalistic and, given the later direction of American popular culture, just plain dumb (without fiddling and dancing, by blacks and whites, what popular culture would we have?). The quasi-aristocratic status of leaders like Jay, and the aristocratic aspirations of arrivistes like Hamilton, give the society a veneer of elitism (the many Quaker outsiders in its ranks are, for the purposes of this indictment, forgotten).\n\nNo such reservations occurred to William Hamilton, a black carpenter, orator, and journalist, when slavery finally ended in New York in 1827. He marked the occasion with a speech at the African Zion Church, which he had helped found, on the Fourth of July: \u201cThis day has the state of New York regenerated herself \u2014 this day has she been cleansed of a most foul, poisonous, and damnable stain.\u201d\n\nHow, in Hamilton\u2019s opinion, had this happened? \u201cThe cause of emancipation,\u201d he said, \u201chas ever had its votaries, but they stood single and alone. After the Revolution, they drew nearer together.\u201d Common hopes bred fellowship, and fellowship bred action. Hamilton mentioned New York\u2019s Quakers as an organized body of slavery opponents. \u201cThat venerable body of religionists, called Friends, ought ever to be held in grateful remembrance by us.\u201d\n\nBut there was a still greater body. \u201cThe most powerful lever, or propelling cause was the Manumission Society.\u201d\n\nHamilton paused to savor an almost ecstatic thought. \u201cHow sweet it is to speak of good men! [It] yields a pleasure such as the young feel when talking of their lovers, or the parent feels, when telling of the prattle of their infants.\u201d So much for paternalism, if the patriarchs are compared to young lovers and beloved infants.\n\nHamilton then proceeded to speak of men \u201cwho ought to be deeply inscribed on your memories, and in your hearts: The names of Washington and Jefferson should not be pronounced in the hearing of your children until they could clearly and distinctly pronounce the names I am about to give.\u201d Hamilton was proposing a parallel hierarchy of founding fathers \u2014 the founding fathers of manumission.\n\nThe first name he gave was \u201cthat great and good statesman, the right honorable John Jay. . . . Blessed God! How good it is, he has lived to see, as a reward, the finishing of a work he helped to begin.\u201d Jay, then 81 years old and long retired from politics, still had two more years to live. Hamilton next named five more men: John Murray \u2014 \u201ca man that calumny never did approach, but that she bit her tongue\u201d; Samuel Franklin \u2014 \u201cgood\u201d; John Keese \u2014 \u201cthe zealous, the virtuous, the industrious\u201d; Alexander Hamilton \u2014 \u201cthat excellent soldier\u201d; and Robert Bowne \u2014 \u201cthat man of more than sterling worth.\u201d (Rumor had it that William Hamilton was Alexander\u2019s illegitimate son, which was almost certainly untrue, though the white Hamilton\u2019s antislavery convictions make him a legitimate precursor.)\n\nHamilton then called a roll of 19 other members of the society, including Robert Troup. \u201cThese are the men that formed the Manumission Society, and stamped it with those best of principles, found in the preamble to the constitution, framed by them. It is too excellent to pass over.\u201d And so he read it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a historians\u2019 fashion that identifies all propelling causes with large forces or, if with individuals, then only with little-known ones. Many causes, great and small, undermined slavery in post-revolutionary New York. The state filled with antislavery immigrants as New England sent its surplus population westward. New York\u2019s Dutch, so long set in their ways, began at the end of the 18th century to abandon many customs, from Dutch-language church services to slave owning. More important than demography or cultural assimilation, slaves freed themselves. The 1799 law seemed like permission to run away: If the institution was doomed, why not escape it now? In its wake, manumissions spiked as slaves and masters negotiated short-term deals: I will still work for you, if you promise to free me after five years, or two.\n\nAll these factors played their part. But the best of principles, and a common commitment to them, was, as William Hamilton said, a powerful lever.\n\nThe Manumission Society was a fortuitous alliance of outsiders and insiders \u2014 oddball Quakers and Manhattan elitists. But whatever side they came from, they were determined to lead. Change requires action, which requires some person, or group of people, to be the first to take it. Change always requires what William Hamilton called a \u201cpropelling cause.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s moment of regeneration in 1827 found no imitators; the other remaining northern slave state, New Jersey, had passed its own gradual-abolition law in 1804. New York only moved itself out of the column of slave states. A vital move. New York would be a political swing state throughout the 19th century, pivoting from party to party, its gyrations often deciding close elections. Its partisan preferences were never more consequential than during the Civil War, which many New Yorkers resisted, even to violence. How much stronger would they have fought if a culture of slave owning had persisted there?\n\nThe Manumission Society was not thinking of future wars when it first met in 1785. They were moved by an all-American idea: that slavery deprived \u201cour brethren\u201d of liberty.\n\n\u2013This essay is adapted from Give Me Liberty: A History of America\u2019s Exceptional Idea, due from Basic Books in November.\n\nThis article appears as \u201c\u2018These Our Brethren\u2019\u201d in the November 11, 2019, print edition of National Review.", "description": "Inspired by America\u2019s exceptional idea, it took a vital step toward securing liberty for slaves.", "authors": ["Richard Brookhiser", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Jay Nordlinger", "John Hirschauer", "Charles C.
