(Joe Robbins/Getty)\n\nAsk 10 different people about what constitutes the biggest rivalry in sports and you\u2019ll probably get 10 different answers.\n\nSports fans, by definition, are not objective so therefore they\u2019re incapable of providing an unbiased assessment about rivalries, especially if they involve a team they root for (or against).\n\nBut, two business professors \u2014 B. David Tyler, an associate professor at Western Carolina and Joe B. Cobbs, an associate professor at Northern Kentucky \u2014 still wanted to identify sports biggest rivalries, so they designed a way to do it on an objective, statistical basis.\n\nOn their website, Know Rivalry, asked fans to distribute 100 points among their most hated rivals and then tallied up the results. (For example, a New York fan might allocate 50 points to the Patriots, 40 to the Red Sox and 10 to the Flyers.)\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t agree,\u201d Tyler told The New York Times. \u201cSome people say you can only have one rival. We decided to get some clarity on the idea.\u201d\n\nWhat Tyler and Cobbs found is that the biggest rival in sports, at least statistically, is Arizona-Arizona State. The biggest reason for the large amount of points fans of each team allocated to the other is because neither team has another rival. In second place on the rivalry rankings list is the much more recognizable matchup of Michigan vs. Ohio State.\n\nIn the four major pro sports, Tyler and Cobbs found that Giants-Dodgers (MLB), Falcons-Saints (NFL), Flyers-Penguins (NHL) and Lakers-Celtics (NBA) are the biggest rivalries.\n\n\u201cWhat surprised me was how long fans hold a grudge or remember defining moments,\u201d Cobbs said. \u201cFans name specific moments from specific games and remember the players, even 15 years ago sometimes.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at The New York Times", "description": "2 business professors \u2014 B.
