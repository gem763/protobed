She came. They\u2019re still not happy.", "language": "en", "text": "The mammoth proposal for upgrading the crumbling rail crossings between New York and New Jersey, known as Gateway, has become a major point of friction for the blue-leaning region and President Donald Trump, whose agencies have repeatedly rejected the states\u2019 pleas for Washington to split the costs. A public tour could have created the impression that Chao endorsed the funding request \u2014 while forcing her to parade in front of cameras with some of Trump\u2019s biggest antagonists in the Senate, including two who would become presidential candidates, Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cUnlike other politicians who tour the tunnel solely for media attention, the Secretary is genuinely interested in the issues at hand and finding solutions,\" a DOT spokesperson said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with department practice under the Trump administration. \u201cGiven that Amtrak officials and others were also present, this is far from a surprise.\u201d\n\nBut the lawmakers called Chao\u2019s quiet visit just another sign of the administration\u2019s disregard for the region, compared with the attention DOT lavishes on rural, heavily GOP states like Kentucky.\n\nIt's \"disappointing that Secretary Chao chose to not take up my invitation and instead toured the Hudson River tunnel without the Congressional delegation,\u201d Booker said in a statement after POLITICO informed him of the 2018 visit. He added, \u201cI would have liked to have joined the Secretary on a tour because no one who has seen the state of those tunnels first-hand can deny the urgency with which we need to replace them.\u201d\n\nAnother person involved in the discussions about the Gateway project, including a $12 billion tunnel repair and replacement, said it\u2019s telling that Chao wanted to keep her visit quiet.\n\n\u201cIf Secretary Chao and DOT thought their argument for not releasing funds for Gateway was a good one, they would have made that point publicly on their visit,\u201d the person said by email. \u201cThat they had to do it in secret shows the level of discomfort they have here.\u201d\n\n\n\nMort Downey, who served as deputy secretary of Transportation from 1993 to 2001, found the silence puzzling.\n\n\u201cUsually, if we were headed somewhere, me or the secretary, we would give it a little more attention,\u201c Downey told POLITICO. \u201cNot necessarily a press conference or a public event, but more often than not our view was, \u2018let people know we\u2019re coming around to look at stuff.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn Amtrak official requesting anonymity to discuss the details of Chao\u2018s tour told POLITICO that Chao\u2019s visit was part as of a tour of Amtrak\u2018s Northeast Corridor that runs between Washington and New York. It took place on board an Amtrak inspection car, which has a plate-glass viewing panel that allows rail and infrastructure conditions to be observed.\n\nDowney lamented that Chao didn\u2019t experience what he described as a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d tour outside of the vehicle. Still, he said he was \u201cglad she\u2019s got a sense of it\u201c so that when administration policy is being made, she can be in the room to say, \u201c\u2019yeah, I\u2019ve been in the tunnel and it really looks lousy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn contrast to Chao\u2019s unpublicized visit, Democratic members of the House Transportation Committee who toured the project area last May spoke to reporters in the Penn Station mezzanine and held a 90-minute roundtable with local officials, which was live-streamed on the committee\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nMorning Transportation A daily speed read on transportation and infrastructure \u2014 in your inbox.

Before they left, they toured the Portal North Bridge, the Penn Station Control Center and the Second Avenue Subway for good measure.\n\nThe proposed river crossings would replace and rebuild one of the nation\u2019s most crucial infrastructure chokepoints, which is crumbling after more than a century of use and damage from 2012\u2019s Hurricane Sandy. The Hudson\u2019s existing crossings carry 450 trains and more than 200,000 passengers per day.\n\nBut the project has also become caught up Trump\u2019s larger fights with congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Chao\u2019s visit came just a month after Trump threatened to veto a $1 trillion spending package if it included money for Gateway.\n\nNew York, New Jersey, Amtrak and the federal government agreed late in the Obama administration to split the costs of the upgrades, but Trump\u2019s DOT has rejected the deal, saying local and state officials need to shoulder a higher share of the costs. Trump has also hinted that he\u2019d fund the project in exchange for Congress granting his demands to fund a wall at the U.S.-Mexican border, a trade that Schumer rejected in a September 2017 meeting at the White House, POLITICO reported last year.\n\nLawmakers representing the two states have asked Chao repeatedly to come see for herself why the project is necessary.\n\nSchumer, Gillibrand, Booker and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) sent Chao a formal invitation to visit the project in April 2017, asking her to follow in the \u201ctradition\u201d set by her two Obama-era predecessors. Booker attached a handwritten note: \u201cSecretary Chao, I deeply appreciate your consideration. I hope to see you soon in NY/NJ to view one of the most urgent transportation needs in the U.S.A.,\u201d and signed it, \u201cCory.\u201d\n\nBooker repeated the invitation during a hearing that May, as lawmakers were talking about trying craft the $1 trillion-plus infrastructure bill that the White House was requesting.\n\nBut in June 2017, Chao's scheduler wrote to Booker's office to decline: \u201cAt this time I do not think we are going to be able to have the Secretary visit the Gateway Project.\u201d\n\nLawmakers repeated their requests during Chao\u2019s appearances in March 2018 before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the House Transportation Committee. Those hearings were punctuated by testy exchanges with members from New York and New Jersey who asked her to see the river crossings for herself. \u201cI have been trying to do that,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nThe project\u2019s prospects haven\u2019t improved since then.\n\nDOT is a year and a half late in issuing a decision on the environmental review for the Hudson River Tunnel, and has also assigned the bridge and tunnel projects a \u201cmedium-low\u201d rating that jeopardizes their ability to qualify for federal money.\n\nChao is welcome to come back for a more thorough visit, said a spokesperson for the Gateway Development Corp., a partnership between New York, New Jersey and Amtrak overseeing the development of the Gateway program.\n\n\"We'd be thrilled for the Secretary and staff to get a detailed look at the infrastructure and briefing on the Gateway Program and see fully and up close why we need 21st Century transportation for the nation's economic heart,\u201d said Stephen Sigmund, the partnership\u2019s chief of public outreach.\n\nAsked about this latest invite, a DOT spokesperson said she's \"already had a detailed look, with Amtrak.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b0/29/6b4de07e4d6498fc64beba8d5a13/191004-elaine-chao-dot-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
