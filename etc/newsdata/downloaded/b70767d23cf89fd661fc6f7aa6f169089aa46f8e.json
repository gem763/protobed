As Trysta Krick details, someone forgot to tell Juan Soto. USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2013 They toppled the invincible, and took a massive step toward doing the impossible.\n\nYes, the Washington Nationals\u2019 first World Series victory in their franchise\u2019s history wasn\u2019t just any old Game 1 win.\n\nThey felled the unbeatable Gerrit Cole, breaking the Houston Astros ace\u2019s 19-game winning streak, and showcased for the world their superstar slugger who, for at least a few more days, is still too young to drink.\n\nIn this startling, World Series-turning 5-4 victory, the Nationals got a game-tying solo home run from Juan Soto, who turns 21 on Friday. He followed four innings later with a ringing two-run double that provided the eventual winning runs.\n\nBoth drives soared to the opposite field, the home run reaching the train tracks of Minute Maid Park, the double ringing hard off the left field fence.\n\nNationals left fielder Juan Soto slugs a home run in the fourth inning. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBoth stunned the overflow crowd of 43,339 and Cole, whose postseason to date was as rhythmic and reliable as a metronome.\n\nFifteen strikeouts in 7 \u2154 innings against Tampa Bay.\n\nTen strikeouts in eight innings against Tampa Bay.\n\nSeven strikeouts in seven innings against the New York Yankees.\n\nAnd just one earned run given up, a playoff 0.40 ERA and an umblemished record since his last defeat, on May 22.\n\nThat same day, the Nationals, already left for dead, lost to the Mets at Citi Field to fall to 19-30. A day later, their bullpen would blow another lead and fall to 19-31, a record now burned in the memory of their most devoted fans.\n\nSince then, the Nationals have posted an 83-39 record, a .680 win percentage that includes a startling 8-1 record in the postseason.\n\nAnd while the world now knows not to take them lightly, no win was perhaps as stunning as Game 1.\n\nTACO TUESDAY: Nationals speedy shortstop wins everyone a free taco\n\nRECORD: Springer sets record with HR in 5th straight World Series game\n\nState of the series\n\nThe Astros will send Justin Verlander \u2013 who will finish first or second ahead of or behind Cole in the AL Cy Young race \u2013 to the mound for Game 2 at Minute Maid Park, with Stephen Strasburg (1.10 career ERA) going for the Nationals.\n\nManager\u2019s special\n\nDave Martinez got aggressive and then got greedy \u2013 and it nearly cost him Game 1. With starter Max Scherzer gutting through five innings on 112 pitches, Martinez went to lefty starter Patrick Corbin for his fourth relief appearance and it went splendidly, as he struck out Carlos Correa and Martin Maldonado in a scoreless sixth.\n\nBut instead of riding Corbin as long as needed \u2013 Corbin hadn\u2019t pitched since Oct. 15 \u2013 Martinez lifted him, perhaps with an eye toward keeping him in line for a Game 3 start. Tanner Rainey, who recorded several big outs in the NL Division Series and NLCS, was summoned instead.\n\nGeorge Springer greeted him with a booming home run to make it 5-2 and Rainey followed with one-out walks to Altuve and Michael Brantley. That forced the emergency activation of closer Daniel Hudson, who got the innings final two outs and left the bases loaded by striking out Yordan Alvarez.\n\nIt was white-knuckle time from there \u2013 Hudson gave up an eighth-inning run on Springer\u2019s double to the fence, but lefty Sean Doolittle escaped by getting Michael Brantley on a fly to left.\n\nHistory lesson\n\nThere are postseason records \u2013 and then there are postseason records. Springer homered for the fifth consecutive World Series game, breaking a tie with Reggie Jackson and Lou Gehrig. He entered Game 1 with an .894 career OPS in 43 postseason games.\n\n\"I told them in the dugout we need to play in the World Series more often because he hits homers every single time it feels like,\" said Astros manager A.J. Hinch. \"He's off to a really good start. His first game in the last World Series maybe not so much but he's picking up right where he left off.\"\n\nRISP-y business\n\nThe Astros stranded 11 runners and were 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position, bringing their postseason mark to 15 for 89 (.169).", "description": "Nationals outfielder Juan Soto homers and adds a two-run double off Astros ace Gerrit Cole to lead Washington to Game 1 win of the World Series.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
