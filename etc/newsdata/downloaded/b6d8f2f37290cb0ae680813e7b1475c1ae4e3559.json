While Yuhu will make a fortune, ratepayers are being ripped off.\"\n\nSimon Zhou was elected to Ryde council in 2017.\n\nAs the numbers currently stand Labor and the Greens, which comprise an informal bloc, have six votes on council.\n\nMr Zhou, as an independent, provides the crucial seventh vote on the 12-member council and was elected deputy mayor in September last year, with the support of this bloc.\n\nDue to the tight numbers, if Mr Zhou abstains from a vote put forward by the Labor/Green bloc it will pass, as they will have 6 of 11 votes.\n\n\u201cHim leaving the chamber or abstaining is as good as voting for a motion,\u201d Mr Lane said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf he does not vote, we can\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nThe mayor, Mr Laxale, said there was \u201cno such thing\u201d as a Green-Labor voting bloc and there were no voting arrangements between Mr Zhou and Labor.\n\nHe noted Mr Zhou had disclosed his relationship with Mr Huang and abstained from the Eastwood vote.\n\nHe said the matter was concluded by council in May after an outside body, the Sydney North Planning Panel, insisted Yuhu first negotiate a development agreement with the council.\n\nThe Yuhu motion was carried seven votes to four, as the other independent, Roy Maggio, also gave his support. That means it would have passed even without Mr Zhou's absence.\n\nMr Maggio told the Financial Review that Mr Zhou had not disclosed a financial link with Mr Huang or Yuhu.\n\n\u201cIf I knew there were financial ties, that would have changed my mind on how I voted,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to rely on the information given to us by the council officers. And they were very supportive of the proposal.\u201d\n\nMr Zhou never stood to profit from the Eastwood Plaza development but had a shareholding in one of Mr Huang's unrelated companies.\n\nProfessor Ryan said full disclosure was important, as council staff and a general manager who had no knowledge of councillors\u2019 financial interests could be open to pressure from a mayor, or deputy mayor, who controlled their employment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe main thing is you put it on the record, so people can say, \u2018Has the decision making process been fair?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nMr Zhou declined to comment on his business affairs but said he acted with \u201cutmost integrity\u201d in all matters.\n\nYuhu Group was founded by Chinese businessman Huang Xiangmo.\n\n\u201cI vehemently object to any suggestions that my office or myself have been involved in any dishonest or questionable conduct pertaining to due process in council,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI never tried to influence staff or councillors on this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a pity that I couldn\u2019t vote, but if I could, I would have voted for this proposal, because a new shopping centre including an upgraded Eastwood plaza [is] exactly what our local community has wanted for a long time.\u201d\n\nMr Huang did not respond to questions from the Financial Review.\n\nLabor took control of the Ryde council at the September 2017 election after getting four candidates elected, up from two before the poll. Its preferences then helped get two Greens elected, one of whom has since joined Labor.\n\nLabor\u2019s former rising star\n\nAs the swing member on Ryde council Simon Zhou\u2019s presence, just as much as his voting pattern, is the crucial factor in determining council outcomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis makes the manner of his election in September 2017 all the more notable.\n\nHe decided to run for council despite not living in the Ryde local government area at the time, having few discernable links to the community, and no profile among residents.\n\nEqually unusual was Mr Zhou spending $68,200 of his own money on the campaign, according to a return filed with the NSW Electoral Commission, for a job on council which pays around $28,000 annually.\n\nHuang's Yuhu Group bought the Eastwood shopping centre for $55 million in 2013.\n\nBy comparison, the Liberals spent around $30,000 across six candidates in three wards.\n\n\u201cWhy would you run for council if you don\u2019t live in the area. I always thought that was a bit odd,\u201d said Trenton Brown, a Liberal councillor.\n\n\u201cBy its very nature, local government represents those who live in the area.\n\n\"If you don\u2019t live there, I\u2019m not sure why you would really care.\u201d\n\nAnd despite running as an independent, Mr Zhou had Mr Wong, who was still a NSW Labor upper house member at the time, officially open his electoral office last February.\n\nOn being elected the previous September, Mr Zhou told reporters he wanted to be \u201ca true independent\u201d and that party politics should not be present at the local level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to their mutual shareholding in the Pymble office complex, Mr Huang and Mr Zhou were connected through the Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China (ACPPRC), which has been described as a Communist Party organ.\n\nMr Huang was chairman of the Beijing-backed group and during his tenure, Mr Zhou was an executive vice-president.\n\nMembership of the group put Mr Zhou firmly in the pro-Beijing camp, a position he made clear when the council moved an emergency declaration in June to support the Hong Kong protestors.\n\nMr Zhou voted against the declaration and then succeeded in watering it down at subsequent council meetings.\n\nThe long road to council approval\n\nOn the surface, Yuhu looked to have made some significant concessions to its initial development application for Eastwood Plaza, also known as the Eastwood Shopping Centre, after it was rejected by council in late 2016.\n\nIt cut the number of apartments in the complex by 34 to 409 while allocating five dwellings for affordable housing, up from none previously.\n\nRenderings of proposed Eastwood Plaza upgrade, which adds a tower of apartments atop the older-style shopping centre in Eastwood.\n\nBut a closer look at the application shows the number of bedrooms in the complex actually increased by 44 to 784. This was done by slashing the number of one-bedroom apartments by 40 per cent, while tripling the number of higher value and higher margin three-bedroom dwellings.\n\nThe overall effect was to increase rather than decrease the number of people who could potentially live in the apartment complex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for social housing, the five apartments offered by Yuhu was 40 per cent below the recommended level, a point made by Greens councillor Christopher Gordon, who ultimately still supported the motion.\n\nIn addition Yuhu contributed $9.2 million for community infrastructure, up from $1.3 million previously. The project cost remained the same at $277 million.\n\nSimon Zhou, left, with mentor and former NSW Labor upper house member Ernest Wong. Supplied\n\nFor six years, Mr Huang had struggled to win planning approval for the Eastwood site, amid community concerns around over-development in the area.\n\nIn an effort to bolster support for the project he used the shopping centre as a backdrop for donations to community and church groups, and when announcing a $1 million bequest for children\u2019s cancer research and $1.8 million to set up the Australia-China Relations Institute (ACRI) at the University of Technology Sydney.\n\nDespite these gestures, a development application for the site was knocked back by Ryde Council in late 2016.\n\nIt was a period during which Mr Huang\u2019s business and political interests were coming together.\n\nIn June 2016, he reportedly cancelled a $400,000 donation to federal Labor after defence spokesman Stephen Conroy criticised Beijing\u2019s actions in the South China Sea.\n\nAt the same time he wrote in The Global Times newspaper that Chinese donors \u201cneed to learn . . . how to have a more efficient combination between political requests and political donations\u201d.\n\nAs Labor was scrambling to fill the $400,000 funding hole from Mr Huang\u2019s cancelled donation, Mr Zhou suddenly emerged as a candidate on Labor\u2019s NSW Senate ticket for the July 2 election, albeit in the unwinnable seventh position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would later emerge that in a six-week period from May 15 to July 1, six companies with links to Mr Zhou and an associate, Xudong \u201cChris\u201d Wang, donated $305,000 to the ALP.\n\nAfter running unsuccessfully for the Senate, Mr Zhou was hired as an adviser in the ALP\u2019s NSW headquarters, even as his links to Mr Huang were formalised through his shareholding the Pymble Corporate Centre.\n\nIn December that year, Mr Zhou set up a company, Zwymble, in which he held 50.5 per cent of the shares. Chris Wang held another 16 per cent.\n\nMr Zhou\u2019s wife was the sole director.\n\nSix days later Zwymble became a shareholder in Mr Huang\u2019s Austrump Times, the holding vehicle for the $82 million Pymble Corporate Centre deal. Zwymble\u2019s 5 per cent share would be worth $4 million.\n\nIt is not clear how Mr Zhou paid for the stake \u2013 one of his companies had been hit with a $2.3 million tax bill two weeks earlier. It is not suggested there was anything improper about his stake in the company.\n\nLabor ambitions scuttled\n\nA year into his career at Labor head office, Mr Zhou was forced to resign when his links to China's Communist Party and his involvement in a gold trading scandal were made public by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.\n\nUnfazed, just two months later he was campaigning hard to win a seat on Ryde Council as an independent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat same month his company Zwymble filed a notice with the corporate regulator that his wife had been replaced as sole director by Chris Wang\u2019s wife, Yang Yang.\n\nThe Neighbourhood Teahouse runs a cafe in Mr Zhou\u2019s electorate office.\n\nThe August 23 notice said Mr Zhou\u2019s shares in Zwymble had been transferred to the company owned by his mother.\n\nOn December 11, 2017, a new ASIC filing showed Mr Zhou\u2019s original shares in Zwymble, which had been transferred to his mother, had been transferred again.\n\nThe new owners were his business partner Chris Wang and his wife Yang Yang, who now had 66 per cent of the company. It\u2019s not known what Mr Wang paid for the stake or whether Mr Zhou retains an interest in future profits from it.\n\n\u201cIt was just a change of mind,\u201d Mr Zhou said of selling the Zwymble shares to Mr Wang. \u201cIt was supposed to be an investment company but I was too busy to do it.\u201d\n\nMr Wang and Mr Zhou regularly invest together, and maintain separate nearby offices in the Dymocks Building in Sydney city. In addition to Zwymble they currently have shared investments in two property companies and another new gold trading company.\n\nTheir most recent shared investment was on August 14, the day when headlines reported Yuhu had finally won development approval for Eastwood Plaza.\n\nLater that day, Mr Wang bought a half share in Neighbourhood Teahouse, a company owned by Mr Zhou\u2019s mother and which runs a cafe in Mr Zhou\u2019s electorate office.\n\n\u201cThere was a potential for doing some distribution and importing and exporting goods, but it hasn\u2019t started yet,\u201d Mr Zhou told the Financial Review of the Neighbourhood Tea investment.\n\n\u201cMr Wang told me he could get some popular tea and consumer-related products. To encourage people \u2013 of course, they want me to put some resources in. I had to give him some shares.\u201d", "description": "The Chinese billionaire stands to make $135 million profit from a Sydney planning decision, thanks to a local councillor who failed to declare a $4 million link to the developer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.345%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_45%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9e27c3bbb874cb5177992d561b347380d2f50fbf", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
