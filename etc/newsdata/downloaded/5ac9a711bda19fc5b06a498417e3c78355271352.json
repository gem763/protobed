Breadth is poor with about two losers for each gainer but Apple (AAPL) , Microsoft (MSFT) and a few big cap names are offsetting the broader weakness in small caps.\n\nThere appears to be a widespread belief that the China trade 'deal' that was made on Friday was largely a joke. There is nothing written, few details and none of the more difficult issues were addressed. Many market players have a vested interest in a disappointing reaction to this deal but so far the obvious 'sell the news' reaction is not gaining much traction.\n\nWhile the sellers aren't able to do much, the buyers aren't generating much movement either. There are a few big caps attracting some interest but it continues to be mostly index driven action. There are no pockets of momentum, little interest in bottom fishing and individual stock picking continues to be extremely challenging.\n\nThe problem that the bears face is that a selloff on China news is just too obvious. There are plenty of buyers lined up to take advantage of weakness at this point. There was some progress on China trade and that is all that is needed to bring in some buyers. Most of these buyers prefer to buy lower so they are waiting for the bears to press before they act more aggressively.\n\nI'm staying focused on the charts of individual stocks. When the market is less index driven and more focused on earnings we should see better action. So far the way this is developing is positive but the big gap on the charts that was created on Friday morning may need to be filled sooner or later to provide a better technical setup.\n\nThis is very lackluster action so far but the struggle will help individual charts to develop and that would be encouraging with earnings season fast approaching.\n\n(Apple and Microsoft are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.
