The outages in nine northern counties would begin later in the day. The areas potentially impacted include portions of Butte, El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, Sutter and Yuba counties in the Sierra foothills and Lake, Napa and Sonoma counties in the North Bay.\n\nAn estimated 124,000 people would be effected.\n\nEarlier this month, PG&E agreed to pay $11 billion to insurance companies holding 85% of the insurance claims from fires that include the November 2018 blaze that destroyed the town of Paradise, killing 86 people. It does not include thousands of uninsured and underinsured fire victims who have filed their own claims against PG&E, including for wrongful deaths.\n\nIt is important for PG&E to pull itself from under bankruptcy protection because it will be a big part of a state wildfire fund set up to help California's major utilities pay out future claims as climate change makes wildfires across the U.S. West more frequent and severe\n\nThe utility sought bankruptcy protection in January because it said it could not afford an estimated $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits stemming from the catastrophic wildfires.\n\nThe settlement confirmed Monday is subject to bankruptcy court approval.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
