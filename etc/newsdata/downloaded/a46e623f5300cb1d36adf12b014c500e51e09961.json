He\u2019ll try to persuade his boss, Boris Johnson, to do whatever it takes \u2013 even if this means flouting the constitutional convention that prime ministers must resign if they lose a vote of no confidence and a rival can win a vote of confidence. Pro-Europeans inside and outside parliament must foil Cummings\u2019 devilish plot. So I have devised a nine-point plan that should do the trick.\n\n1. Don\u2019t go for a premature election\n\nThere can\u2019t be a snap election unless either two thirds of MPs support one or Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence in Johnson and wins. Either way, there can\u2019t be an election without the Labour leader\u2019s approval. So he shouldn\u2019t go for one until and unless the conditions are ripe.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAt the moment, an election would be a bad idea. Cummings might succeed in delaying it until after we\u2019ve already crashed out of the EU. Even if he doesn\u2019t, Johnson might win the election by squeezing Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party. If the pro-European forces stay divided, the Tories could get a majority of MPs with as little as a third of the popular vote.\n\n2. Pass a law calling for a referendum\n\nA majority of MPs probably now back a new referendum. That is a change from the spring when several Final Say motions narrowly failed in parliament. Johnson\u2019s arrival in Downing Street is responsible for the swing in opinion: sensible Conservative MPs are scared of his plan to crash out of the EU. They are also outraged by Cummings\u2019 threats to turn our constitution upside down.\n\nTo get a new referendum, two laws will be required. The first will have to force the prime minister to ask the EU to delay Brexit for at least six months, so there\u2019s enough time to hold it. The second will set out the rules for that referendum. If Johnson stays on as prime minister, the people should be asked to choose between staying in the EU and what he wants (that is, crashing out).\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Move fast\n\nThe clock is ticking towards 31 October, so there\u2019s no point in waiting to pass the law forcing Johnson to ask for extra time. As soon as MPs get back from parliamentary \u201crecess\u201d, on 3 September, they should grab the first opportunity to do so.\n\nThere is still a question about how to get the time to debate the legislation. Cummings will use every trick in the book to stop MPs having their say. The government doesn\u2019t plan to push any laws of its own through as it fears MPs will hijack them, according to the Mail on Sunday.\n\nNormally, the government controls the parliamentary timetable. But ultimately MPs have the power to make their own rules \u2013 and so should be able to grab control of the timetable. The speaker, John Bercow, has already shown that he sees himself as the House of Commons\u2019 servant, not the government\u2019s lapdog. He said yesterday: \u201cParliament will be heard and nobody is going to get away as far as I am concerned with stopping that happening.\u201d\n\nParliament is expected to take a three week break from 13 September for the party conference season. But if pro-European MPs can\u2019t find a way to ram through legislation by then, they should refuse to call a recess \u2013 and keep working until they succeed.\n\n4. Sack the PM\n\nIf MPs can\u2019t pass a law by mid-October, they will have to switch tack \u2013 and sack Boris Johnson. That will be when Jeremy Corbyn should call a vote of no confidence. But that doesn\u2019t mean he should be gagging for an election \u2013 Brexit must first be delayed, otherwise we\u2019ll crash out before the people have given their view about whether that\u2019s what they want.\n\nIf Johnson loses a no confidence vote, however, convention dictates that he shouldn\u2019t do anything to prejudge what a future government might decide. In this context, that means he should ask the EU for extra time to negotiate our departure. But since he can\u2019t be relied to stick to convention, he\u2019ll probably have to be physically removed from Downing Street.\n\n5. Form an emergency national government\n\nUnder another convention, Johnson has to resign if he loses a no confidence vote and a rival can win one. If he refuses to go, the Queen can fire him. The Fixed Term Parliaments Act gives a 14 day period to see if that anybody can form an alternative government before an election is called. If they can, the new prime minister will be able to ask the EU to delay Brexit.\n\nUnfortunately, it won\u2019t be easy for anybody to win a vote of confidence. Corbyn would be the natural first choice, but many Conservative MPs who hate the idea of crashing out also dislike the idea of the Labour leader in Downing Street. The same goes for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, the Labour leadership is saying it won\u2019t back a compromise candidate, such as Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer or the Tories\u2019 David Lidington, as a caretaker prime minister. And an idea by Caroline Lucas, the Green MP and former Green Party leader, to form a government made up of just women has not gone down well, even though we certainly need women to play a much bigger role in our political life.\n\nIf the legislative route to a referendum fails, pro-European MPs have got to rise above their differences and rally behind somebody as an emergency prime minister. They don\u2019t need to form a formal coalition, as they could also support a minority government from the backbenches. But they must put the national interest first.\n\n6. Still don\u2019t rush into an election\n\nAn emergency government could call an election, but it shouldn\u2019t rush into doing so. It should first consider whether it would be better to hold a new referendum. Much will depend on whether the pro-European forces think they can win an election which, in turn, will be influenced by how unified they are. There\u2019s also a question of how long an emergency government could last. If it can hang together for six months, it may be best to go for a referendum \u2013 and then have an election after that.\n\n7. Work together\n\nIf there\u2019s an election before Brexit, pro-Europeans have to work together. They must form a Remain Alliance, fielding one candidate wherever possible in all seats which it is realistic to win from the pro-Brexit Tories and the few pro-Brexit Labour MPs. Otherwise, they will split the vote and Johnson could emerge victorious.\n\nPro-Europeans will also have to work together after an election because it is most unlikely that Labour will have an overall majority. Again, they will have to put party politics behind them and look to the national interest. If Labour promises in its manifesto to cancel Brexit, it would revoke Article 50 and we\u2019d stay in the EU. More likely, Corbyn will promise a referendum. He will then have to hold together some sort of minority or coalition government for at least six months.\n\n8. What is the question?\n\nIn this scenario, the choice in the Final Say should probably be between staying in the EU or leaving with a deal. Although Corbyn could negotiate a different political declaration setting out our future relations with the EU to the one Theresa May negotiated, the only divorce deal on offer will be the miserable one she produced.\n\nJohnson and Farage will scream blue murder if the crash-out option isn\u2019t on the ballot paper. But if they\u2019ve just lost an election, why should they set the question? And why should a national unity government be saddled with trying to implement a mad policy in the unfortunate event that the people decided they wanted a no-deal Brexit?\n\n\u201cNo deal\u201d should only be on the ballot paper if Johnson is still in Downing Street and owns the consequences of it.\n\n9. Build \"Project Hope\"\n\nWhether we have a referendum or an election, we will need winning arguments. In 2016, we lost partly because David Cameron relied just on fear.\n\nOf course there is a lot to fear from a no-deal Brexit, but we also need to offer the voters hope. We need to show that the things people care about can be made better if we stay in the EU.\n\nFortunately, there are lots of good arguments: we have a better chance to fix the big global problems such as the climate crisis if we are an influential voice in a powerful club of like-minded nations; and we can fix the problems at home \u2013 whether it\u2019s care for the elderly, knife crime or lack of public investment in huge swathes of the country \u2013 if we have a healthy economy and our politicians aren\u2019t fixating about Brexit to the exclusion of everything else.\n\nWhile much of the action in coming months will be in parliament, pro-European citizens must keep mobilising for the fight ahead. They must keep writing to their MPs, they must keep signing petitions and they must get out on the streets \u2013 especially for the big People\u2019s Vote/Final Say march planned for 19 October.\n\nHugo Dixon is deputy chair of the People\u2019s Vote campaign and chair of InFacts", "description": "Dominic Cummings is hell-bent on quitting the EU on 31 October.
