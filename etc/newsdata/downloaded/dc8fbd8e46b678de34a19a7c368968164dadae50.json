In the process, director Steven Soderbergh mostly squanders a cast toplined by Meryl Streep, in a Netflix film that plays like a darkly satiric connection of vignettes that lost something -- mostly, a coherent narrative -- in the rinse cycle.\n\nBilled as being \"Based on Actual Secrets,\" the movie seeks to illuminate the Panama Papers, the leaked trove of documents in 2016 that detailed systemic abuses by banking, business and legal entities, creating international shell companies to hide wealth and avoid taxes.\n\nInstead of a clear recounting of those events -- either through the firms involved, or the manner in which the story was broken -- the eclectic Soderbergh and writer Scott Z. Burns (\"The Informant!\") seek to cheekily illustrate the themes in reporter Jake Bernstein's book \"Secrecy World\" by employing direct-to-camera explanations from Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, playing the martini-sipping principals in Mossack Fonseca, the Panama City law firm at the center of the scandal.\n\nStreep, meanwhile, portrays a widow deprived a full insurance settlement after a tragic accident, who begins nosing around about the shady and illicit doings of a shell company with the Orwellian name United Re-Insurance Group.\n\nThe movie repeatedly digresses, however, to explore several other interludes that basically parachute in, exposing tentacles of the operation in a way that's moderately interesting but dramatically numbing.\n\nRead More", "description": "Meryl Streep toplines big cast in Netflix movie from director steven Soderbergh that puts poor spin on Panama Papers case", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190923225211-the-laundromat-meryl-streep-super-tease.jpg"}
