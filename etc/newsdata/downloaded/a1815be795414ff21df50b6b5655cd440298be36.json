Wow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!),\" Trump said in a tweet following the jobs report on Friday.\n\nThe jobless rate dropped 0.2 percentage points to 3.5% in September, matching a level last seen in December 1969. Nonfarm payrolls, however, came in below expectations, rising by just 136,000 versus the estimates of 145,000.\n\nHouse Democrats launched an impeachment probe into Trump last week, based on a whistleblower complaint about Trump's call with the Ukrainian president. Trump, in the call, asked whether Ukraine could \"look into\" unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing against former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter.\n\nMany Democrats have also questioned the Trump administration's decision to delay hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, without providing a clear explanation at the time.\n\nTrump has lamented that the impeachment inquiry may make it harder for him to work with Democrats on efforts such as slashing drug costs and infrastructure.\n\nThe president on Thursday called on China to look into the Bidens, a week before the two countries resume their high-stakes trade talks in Washington.\ufeff", "description": "President Donald Trump took aim at the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, while the country sits at a 50-year low for unemployment under his administration.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106162714-1570113750431rtx75wra.jpg?v=1570113805", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
