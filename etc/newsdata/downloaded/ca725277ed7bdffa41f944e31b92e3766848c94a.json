The collection, by the Adidas Consortium Workshop, includes lifestyle apparel and footwear inspired by lawn-based activities and outdoor-centric innovations and technologies.\n\n'The good-humoured, gardening-inspired capsule collection is a clarion call to all the like minded \"avant-gardeners\" out there,' explains Adidas. 'It is for those who lovingly nurture lawns and meticulously scatter seeds. But the range of apparel, accessories and footwear also offers a fresh take on modern, outdoors and hiking trends, resulting in \"horti-couture\" that can move effortlessly from the lawn to the streets.'\n\nSo, what's in the collection?\n\nThere are three footwear styles in a colour palette that blends floral bursts of bright blues, purples and orange with grounded earthy tones \u2013 and the names are said to resonate with true gardening aficionados.\n\n\n\nThe specially-created Response Hoverturf is a shoe 'ready for almost any terrain'. It's available in a more understated grey version for everyday gardening tasks and a sleek black version 'with lace cover panel' which Adidas says is ideal for 'more covert, night-time pruning operations'.\n\nPhoto credit: Adidas More\n\nThe other footwear on offer is the Novaturbo, which comes with the ease of easily slipping on and off and is said to be inspired by some of the most innovative mid-2000s designs from the Adidas archive. According to Adidas, 'even the most green-fingered wearer will be satisfied with the amount of ripstop nylon at hand and will find plenty of pockets for tools and fuel'.\n\nThoughts so far? For clothing, Adidas' apparel has been built for breathability: from the asymmetric mesh panels of the Sonicdrive vest to the above-knee zip that enables the Sonicdrive pants to transform into, wait for it... Sonicdrive shorts.\n\nPhoto credit: Adidas More\n\nPhoto credit: Adidas More", "description": "Is this what we call gardening in style?", "authors": ["Olivia Heath"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XbBkZ6GlWYgT8nBXooYpUA--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/house_beautiful_473/0525a32bd253c1204276cb8b8b132f6d", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
