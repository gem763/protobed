He won the World Series in 2017 after a trade to the Houston Astros.\n\nFormer teammates Chipper Jones and Alex Bregman were among those who quickly paid tribute to McCann via Twitter.\n\nTo one of my favorite teammates ever.....congrats on a fabulous career! Thanks for keeping me young and keeping me from retiring a couple yrs earlier. Ur a true pro, a leader of men, a great father and a best friend! Have a great retirement, Brian McCann! Ur the best out there \u2014 Chipper Jones (@RealCJ10) October 10, 2019\n\nBrian McCann is one of the best catchers to ever play the game but also the best dude I met in Professional Baseball. Love you bro. \u2014 Alex Bregman (@ABREG_1) October 10, 2019\n\nMcCann re-signed with Atlanta as a free agent in November to play for manager Brian Snitker, who was his manager at Double-A Mississippi when the Braves first called him up directly to the majors in 2005.\n\n\"Yeah, he knew,\" McCann said of Snitker. \"I've known him for a long, long time. He was my Double-A manager. Being able to do this with him as my manager is something I'll always remember.\"\n\nA six-time Silver Slugger, McCann passed 1,000 career RBIs in his final season. He finished with a career .262 average, 282 home runs and 1,018 RBIs. This season, he hit .249 with 12 homers and 45 RBIs in 85 games.\n\n\"This is everything that I wanted to do,\" McCann said. \"I wanted to come back and get a chance at the postseason.\"", "description": "Brian McCann, 35, revealed his plans after Atlanta's 13-1 loss to St. Louis in the decisive Game 5 of the National League Division Series.", "authors": ["Alden Gonzalez", "Jeff Passan", "Jesse Rogers", "Bradford Doolittle", "Marly Rivera", "Steve Richards"], "top_image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F0821%2Fr586794_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
