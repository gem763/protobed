Instead, Don King was eating a plateful of ribs, making those waiting on him in Las Vegas very anxious. It was only a bit of the gamesmanship that went on in one of the most significant fights promoted by the two leading promoters in boxing history.\n\nKing and Felix Trinidad were supposed to be in Las Vegas for an early evening news conference to push the upcoming bout between Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya, the 1992 Olympic gold medal winner and the star, at the time, of promoter Bob Arum\u2019s stable.\n\nDe La Hoya and Trinidad were unbeaten welterweight champions, each with a legitimate claim to the 147-pound throne, and a combined 66-0 record with 55 knockouts.\n\nThe intrigue in the fight was obvious. It pitted De Le Hoya, the boxer, versus Trinidad, the powerful slugger. It was De La Hoya, the wildly popular Mexican-American star, versus Trinidad, the idol of millions in Puerto Rico.\n\nAnd perhaps most of all, it was a battle of boxing\u2019s most intense and long-running rivalry, Bob Arum versus Don King.\n\n\u201cMost of my fights were in the heavyweight division, but there were a couple of guys at that time who were very popular and you knew could do big numbers,\u201d King told Yahoo Sports on Wednesday. \u201cJulio Cesar Chavez was an idol in Mexico and we did that massive crowd [of over 130,000 in Mexico City] there with [Greg Haugen]. He was a fighter of the people. And then there was Oscar and Tito. They were two really good fighters and they had a great rivalry and there was that Mexican and Puerto Rican rivalry there and the thing with me and old \u2018Lonesome Bob,\u2019 and it just clicked.\u201d\n\nThe bout was something of a litmus test about how non-heavyweights could do on pay-per-view. Pay-per-view, in the form it is known now, wasn\u2019t quite 10 years old in 1999. It debuted on April 19, 1991, when TVKO, HBO Sports\u2019 pay-per-view arm, put on a heavyweight title fight between George Foreman and Evander Holyfield in Atlantic City.\n\nDe La Hoya-Trinidad wasn\u2019t a heavyweight fight on the scales, as combined their 294 pounds were only slightly more than the 257 Foreman weighed eight years earlier when he fought Holyfield. But their bout was a heavyweight attraction at the box office and probably the most compelling non-heavyweight match in the sport since Sugar Ray Leonard fought Marvelous Marvin Hagler for the middleweight title 12 years earlier.\n\nThe 20th anniversary of the day that, as King gleefully put it on Sept. 18, 1999, \u201cthe lights went out in Arumville,\u201d is one that still makes De La Hoya\u2019s stomach flip.\n\n\u201cThat fight haunts me every single day of my life,\u201d De La Hoya told Yahoo Sports on Wednesday. \u201cJesus. It\u2019s a tough one for me to talk about even now. Not a day goes by that people don\u2019t bring it up to me. Of course, they tell me that they think I won, but still \u2026 \u201d\n\nHis voice trails off, his disappointment at the controversial majority decision that favored Trinidad still gnawing at him.\n\nOscar De La Hoya congratulates Felix Trinidad following their welterweight championship bout at the Mandalay Bay Events Center on Sept. 18, 1999 in Las Vegas.

King was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1997 and Arum in 1999. De La Hoya and Trinidad went in together in 2014, while judge Jerry Roth was inducted in 2017.\n\nRoth had one of the two scorecards that infuriated many who saw the fight. He favored Trinidad, 115-113. Bob Logist scored it 115-114 for Trinidad, while judge Glen Hamada had it 114-114.\n\nThe fight was De La Hoya\u2019s to win, but he inexplicably ran the final three rounds and threw next-to-no punches.\n\nDe La Hoya was trained for the Trinidad fight by another Hall of Famer, the late Gil Clancy. De La Hoya was boxing well and scoring, and told Yahoo Sports on Wednesday he felt he could have stopped Trinidad down the stretch had he fought differently.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The 20th anniversary of the day that, as King gleefully put it on Sept. 18, 1999, \u201cthe lights went out in Arumville,\u201d is one that still makes De La Hoya\u2019s stomach flip.", "authors": ["Kevin Iole", "Combat Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RKoivCbLyMjeRYJRqXDmpg--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MzM0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/cdccbc90-da70-11e9-b5f7-d12d516cfd08", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
