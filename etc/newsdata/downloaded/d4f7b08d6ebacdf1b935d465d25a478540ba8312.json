Maybe it\u2019s also time for someone to come collect Bradley Cooper, for the sake of Oprah\u2019s much-needed vacation. On Monday\u2019s episode of Ellen, Oprah let the audience in on a little life hack: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, the thing to do is to find friends with boats.\u201d The friend in this instance was David Geffen, who hosted Oprah, Bradley Cooper, Katy Perry, and Orlando Bloom on his boat this summer.\n\nWhen Cooper wasn\u2019t busy reapplying SPF, he was apparently pulling out the party games. \u201cThey like to play games. And I\u2019m really not a game player \u2026 they played Balderdash a lot, and then Bradley Cooper had a game called Wolves and Villagers.\u201d Oprah called it \u201ca complicated game, filled with judgment,\u201d and said that Perry and Cooper were the ones who got the most competitive. The game appears to be a more lycanthropic version of Mafia. Maybe it\u2019s a regional thing, the region being David Geffen\u2019s yacht. Wolves and Villagers is also, weirdly enough, the announced name of a new Quibi project starring Naomi Watts, because we\u2019re living in a post-Tag world where we can do such things (last one to option Duck Duck Goose is a rotten egg). Bradley Cooper would be that one uncle who ropes everyone into playing Monopoly and then flips the table when he loses.\n\nOprah also announced that the first book in her new Apple TV+ series, Oprah\u2019s Book Club, will be Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s novel The Water Dancer. Oprah praised the book to Ellen, saying, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this way since I read Beloved, actually. He has Toni Morrison qualities, in terms of being able to have the mastery of the language, in using words to transform the way you see somebody.\u201d The series premieres on November 1 and will add new episodes every two months. Oprah then gave iPads and gift cards to Ellen\u2019s audience, so that they can all read along. Oprah wants the book club to be global and inclusive, so even Cooper can join, so long as someone tells him it\u2019s not a competition.
