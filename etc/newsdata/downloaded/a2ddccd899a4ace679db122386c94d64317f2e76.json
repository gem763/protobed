REUTERS/Jessica Lutz\n\nPrince Abdulaziz, son of Saudi King Salman and a long-time member of the Saudi delegation to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, replaced Khalid al-Falih on Sunday.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent LCOc1 crude futures were up 35 cents at $61.89 a barrel by 0846 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 was up 31 cents at $56.83 a barrel.\n\nPrice Abdulaziz helped to negotiate the current agreement on supply cuts between OPEC and non-OPEC countries including Russia, a group known as OPEC+ and has been instrumental in cementing that cooperation, OPEC sources said.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Prince Abdulaziz said the pillars of Saudi policy would not change and that the OPEC+ deal would survive.\n\n\u201cThe options for a change of policy are relatively limited,\u201d said Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix. \u201cThe price reaction is muted because we don\u2019t expect a strong change.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s oil output in August exceeded its quota under the OPEC+ agreements to cut 1.2 million barrels per day.\n\nOPEC oil output rose in August, gaining for the first month this year as higher supply from Iraq and Nigeria outweighed restraint by Saudi Arabia and losses caused by U.S. sanctions on Iran, a Reuters survey found.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates\u2019 Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said on Sunday that members of OPEC and non-OPEC producers were \u201ccommitted\u201d to achieving oil market balance.\n\nPrices climbed for a fourth day running on Monday, also supported by comments from Mazrouei that OPEC and its allies were committed to balancing the crude market.\n\nThe OPEC+ deal\u2019s joint ministerial monitoring committee will meet on Thursday in Abu Dhabi.\n\nTrade and geopolitical tensions are affecting the market more than demand and supply, Mazrouei said, but he was quick to rule out hasty steps influenced by the trade war between the United States and China.\n\n\u201cThe fear of slower (oil) demand is only going to happen if that tension is escalating and I am personally hopeful that is not the case,\u201d Mazrouei told Reuters.\n\nPrices on Monday were also supported by a rise in oil imports in China in August, with shipments to the world\u2019s biggest importer up 3% from July and nearly 10% higher in the first eight months of 2019 from a year earlier.\n\nIn the United States, drilling companies cut the number of operating oil rigs for a third week in a row last week.\n\n(Graphic: U.S. Rig count - here)", "description": "Oil prices rose on Monday after Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of crude, named oil veteran Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as its new energy minister, a move seen strengthening an output-cutting deal between OPEC and other producers.", "authors": ["Shadia Nasralla", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427772506&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8802D", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
