And, while they are often the result of natural processes in the ground, human activity can also trigger the phenomenon as well.\n\nMost often, although they are dramatic, sinkholes are not as dangerous as they may seem.\n\nAfter a sinkhole opens up, they can generally be dealt with safely, although there have been deaths related to the phenomenon before.\n\nIn 2010, for instance, a massive 65ft wide and 100ft deep sinkhole appeared in Guatemala City, killing 15 people and swallowing a three-storey factory building.", "description": "A bus has fallen into a sinkhole in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after ground gave way beneath the vehicle as it waited at a traffic light during rush hour.
