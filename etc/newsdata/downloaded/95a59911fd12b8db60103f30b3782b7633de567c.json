It dates back to an eviscerating report tabled by James Landis to then president-elect Kennedy in 1960, which provided fuel to the career of the eminent political scientist, Murray Edelman, in works that compared the regulatory process to a political spectacle. It is only by defenestrating a straw man that the illusion of robust enforcement can be sustained. It is a fairytale. It is also one that is being played to packed media houses. When analysis is limited to balanced reporting of a gamed game, it is unsurprising that public scepticism is so high.\n\nLet us take but one of many examples. According to James Shipton, the chair of ASIC, the agency is only now beginning the process of questioning company statements and better late than never. I thought that was the task of research analysts, activist shareholders (for whatever reason) and an informed media. Apparently not.\n\nNever mind, ASIC, we are informed has arrived on its proverbial white horse. Acknowledging the traditional people and telling them in mellifluous prose that good leadership is essential to community, Shipton then tells his audience at the Australian Institute of Company Directors precisely nothing based on an evaluation that raises more questions than it answers. Reviewing documents without a theoretical lens is a meaningless endeavour. So too are the recommendations that emerge from it, with the archetypes identified poor indicators of performance if not accompanied by financial indicators.\n\nImmature oversight\n\nOversight of non-financial risk was immature. Did not the banks themselves say this in carefully worded evaluations. Risk appetite was not understood. Perhaps Shipton was too busy preparing for his own appearance before the royal commission to notice its centrality to the investigation. The indicators for non-financial performance were undeveloped. I thought we were appraised by that in APRA\u2019s executive remuneration policy last month. The findings represent little more than a re-washing. Confirming previous research and presenting it as your own is one step away from plagiarism.\n\nWhat then of the good news? The exercise is over. \"To debunk any myths, we don\u2019t propose to put behavioural experts in every boardroom on an ongoing basis. Nevertheless, we do feel such inputs into a report like this has been very beneficial, and, most importantly will be helpful to you as directors,\" Shipton told the AICD. It is time to move on. There is nothing much to see. In large measure because no meaningful attempt was made to look.\n\nWhy should we surprised? Because we have every right to be.\n\nAustralia has worn the moniker of the lucky country with pride. For ASIC it will be lucky if no-one digs deep to reveal the charade undertaken in the name of the country. It is little more than a disgrace. It is a disservice to the very communities the agency is designed to protect, as so too is the faux anger it has generated. We have all been gamed.", "description": "For all the faux corporate anger generated by ASIC's experiment with psychology, there was very little to see in the end.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c1dd9bc9a73cddd5aefa28d6584c030e3c099198", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
