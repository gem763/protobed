However, turnout was low, and the violence, plus the Taliban\u2019s earlier threats to attack polling stations, may be a major reason.\n\nMore than 9 million registered voters could have headed to the polls to elect a president among a dozen candidates, led by President Ashraf Ghani and his former deputy Abdullah Abdullah.\n\nThe winner will play a crucial role in the country\u2019s quest to end the war with the Taliban and any resumption of talks between the insurgents and the United States that were called off earlier this month. Due to the difficulty of collecting results across Afghanistan, the overall results will not be known before Nov. 7.\n\nThe Taliban, which controls more of the country than at anytime since its regime was toppled in 2001, has threatened voters to stay away from the election or face dire consequences.\n\nTo protect voters and polling stations, tens of thousands of Afghan forces were deployed across 34 provinces.\n\nA senior interior ministry official in Kabul said at least 21 civilians and two Afghan forces were injured in about a dozen small-scale attacks conducted by the Taliban during the first five hours of voting.\n\n\u201cThe security plan used to prevent attacks seems to be working so far...we have foiled insurgent attacks,\u201d said Abdul Moqim Abdulrahimzai, the director-general of operations and planning at the Interior Ministry.\n\nOfficials with Afghanistan\u2019s Independent Election Commission (IEC) said, however, that they have had no contact with 901 of the 4,942 polling centres across the country, creating doubt about how significant overall turnout will be.\n\nIt was not clear whether voting had taken place in these centres, or they were forced by the Taliban to shut down.\n\nTurnout was \u201cvery poor\u201d in the election\u2019s opening hours, said the Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan, which was observing polls in all provinces.\n\nThat was partly due to the requirement for voters to be photographed, to which female voters in conservative areas object, the foundation said.\n\nOthers were determined to vote.\n\n\u201cBravado gets defined when one musters courage to cast their vote in Afghanistan,\u201d said Roya Jahangir, a doctor based in the capital of Kabul.\n\n\u201cWe hope this time there is no fraud \u2014 otherwise voters will feel cheated once again.\u201d\n\nHowever, by the afternoon, hundreds of voters complained that their names were missing on the voters\u2019 list or on the biometric device used to prevent fraud.\n\nAddressing the concerns of disgruntled voters, the country\u2019s Independent Election Commission (IEC) eased the restrictions, allowing them to vote if they have election stickers on their national identity cards.\n\nPOLLING STATIONS ATTACKED\n\nIn the northern province of Balkh, men and women said they waited for election officials to arrive at polling stations set up in schools, colleges, mosques, hospital campuses and district centres.\n\nAn explosion at a polling station in a mosque in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar wounded 16 people, according to a security source.\n\nIn the northern province of Faryab, Afghan forces clashed with Taliban fighters in six districts, forcing people to stay indoors and refrain from voting.\n\nThe Taliban said in a statement their fighters attacked polling stations in Laghman province, in eastern Afghanistan. Officials said four explosions in the eastern city of Jalalabad disrupted voting at some stations. One person was killed in the Jalalabad blasts.\n\nExplosions also hit Kabul and Ghazni, officials said.\n\nThe hardline Islamist group intensified attacks against the Afghan and foreign forces following the collapse of talks between the United States and the Taliban earlier this month.\n\nWestern diplomats in Kabul said the potential resumption of talks depends on the scale of attacks conducted by the Taliban to prevent elections.\n\n\u201cTalks can only begin if the Taliban exercises restraint and allows people to vote,\u201d said a diplomat overseeing the elections.\n\nPOLLING STATIONS CLOSED\n\nMore than 400 polling centres remained closed because they are in areas under Taliban control. Hundreds more will be closed because of security concerns.\n\nShamsuddin, a resident of Dehdadi district in the northern province of Balkh, said polling stations were not open due to overnight clashes between the Taliban and Afghan forces.\n\nThe voting process is another source of concern.\n\nChief contenders Ghani and his former deputy Abdullah both came to power in 2014 after a bitterly contested election marred by fraud.\n\n\u201cI thank God that today that people\u2019s vote will help the republic of Afghanistan to move forward,\u201d Ghani said, casting his ballot in a Kabul high school.\n\nAbdullah cast his ballot at a different Kabul school.\n\n\u201cThe threats to innocent people do not show the strength of the Taliban,\u201d he said.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s political scene is still tainted by the aftermath of the disputed 2014 presidential vote which forced the two main rival groupings to form an unstable partnership. Both sides were accused of massive electoral cheating.\n\nWestern security sources and Afghan officials said they had asked local media not to sensationalize threats and attacks, concerned that they could discourage voting.\n\nThe election is the fourth presidential vote since the fall of the Taliban to U.S.-led forces.", "description": "Afghans braved the threat of militant attacks and delays at polling booths to vote in a presidential election on Saturday, a major test of the Western-backed Afghan government's ability to protect democracy despite Taliban attempts to derail the polls.", "authors": ["Abdul Qadir Sediqi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434756995&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R044", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
