Potential bidders could include other major energy companies with an interest in the region, the people said.\n\nExxon didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment outside of regular business hours in the U.S., where it\u2019s headquartered in Texas, and representatives in Singapore and Australia weren\u2019t able to provide comment.\n\nThe move follows Exxon\u2019s $4.5 billion deal last month to exit Norway and the decision to put Australian assets back on the market, part of its efforts to fund one of the biggest corporate turnarounds in its history after years of stagnating production and a stock-price that\u2019s lagged rivals. In Asia, Exxon is likely to exit projects worth a combined $5 billion in Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia and Malaysia, Wood Mackenzie Ltd. analysts including Andrew Harwood said in a research note Monday.\n\nExxon produces oil and gas in Malaysia under four production sharing contracts with the state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd, according to its website. Its assets include a 30% stake in the offshore Tapis Blend operations, which produces a low-sulfur crude that was once a benchmark for Asian oil refiners. The PSCs cover 2.4 million acres offshore and have exploration and production terms ranging up to 38 years, Exxon said in its most-recent 10-K filing.\n\nAlso as part of Exxon\u2019s Asia-Pacific divestment push, the company said last month that it\u2019s trying again to offload its oil and gas assets in southeast Australia, including the long-producing Gippsland Basin project offshore Victoria state. The Australian newspaper reported in June that Exxon\u2019s 50% stake in the assets, which include the Longford Gas Plant, could be worth about $3 billion.\n\nMalaysia has been a busy market for energy deals. In April, Petronas agreed to buy stakes in two offshore Brazilian oil fields from Petroleo Brasileiro SA for $1.29 billion, expanding the southeast Asian state giant\u2019s overseas portfolio. It also agreed to buy Amplus Energy Solutions Pte from I Squared Capital, amassing 500 megawatts of solar power in operation or under development.\n\nA month earlier, PTT Exploration & Production Pcl agreed to buy Murphy Oil Corp.\u2019s Malaysian oil and gas assets for $2.1 billion, deploying some of the Thai company\u2019s massive cash reserves.\n\n(Updates with background on deals starting in seventh paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Manuel Baigorri in Hong Kong at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net;Elffie Chew in Kuala Lumpur at echew16@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Fion Li at fli59@bloomberg.net, Ramsey Al-Rikabi\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp is considering a sale of its offshore Malaysia upstream assets as part of U.S. energy giant\u2019s divestiture program, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The company is working with an adviser on the potential sale of the Malaysian assets, which could raise about", "authors": ["Manuel Baigorri", "Elffie Chew"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BkG9leZ1MOt79et_D4uF1A--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/3abc369d52e1778c3587be2e18f12eec", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
