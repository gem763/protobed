Liu, U.S. Attorney for Washington, DC.\n\nMr. Stone\u2019s lawyers have argued the film clip would prejudice jurors because it would suggest their client has ties to the Mafia.\n\nJudge Jackson asked both sides to resolve the issue. But the Justice Department on Thursday asked the judge to help, admitting they are at an impasse.\n\nMs. Liu said in a court filing prosecutors offered to read jurors a jointly written statement describing the scene, but Mr. Stone\u2019s attorney\u2019s balked. Defense counsel has insisted the clip should only be played if witnesses reference it during the trial.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola, the film\u2019s director, told MSNBC this week the clip should be allowed at the trial \u201cif it is relevant to the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Godfather has become part of the culture,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cFrom my point of view, anyone would take stuff from a fictional gangster picture and put it in real life, that is not behavior\u2026 I would recommend.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
