The entire leg was abruptly postponed in April, weeks before it was set to start, so that Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger could have a heart valve replaced. He underwent surgery, quickly recovered, and the dates were rescheduled.\n\nBeginning in Chicago on June 21, the North American leg alone ultimately grossed a total of $177.8 million, including $25.5 million made over just two nights at MetLife Stadium near New York City, Billboard reported.\n\nEach date on the North American leg grossed an average of $11.1 million, with the average price of a ticket costing $282.80, according to Billboard.\n\nThe Stones\u2019 last world tour, the \u201cA Bigger Band Tour\u201d from 2005 through 2007, grossed $558 million, placing it third on Billboard\u2019s list of lucrative tours. Ed Sheeran and U2 hold the first and second spots on the list, respectively.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
