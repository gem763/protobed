It's something that I really don't want to have to remember. I will never forget it.\n\n\"I don't feel safe. I have not been out by myself. I can't bring myself to do it.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"I feel anxious about any noises I hear. It will live with me for ever. I know that.\n\n\"I am not the same person I was before. I am much more sensitive to things and cry for the smallest things.\n\n\"I hate how things make me feel now.\"\n\nMustata, 31, denied two rape offences but was convicted by a jury after a trial at Grimsby Crown Court.\n\nAndrew Bailey, mitigating, said the woman was vulnerable from drinking and the scene of the rapes was \"far from pleasant\".\n\nMustata was jailed for nine years, must register as a sex offender for life and was given an indefinite restraining order.\n\nRecorder Patrick Palmer said: \"It's plain that this offence had a significant effect on her. She couldn't go out on her own.\n\n\"That's serious offences with serious consequences.\"\n\nIn 2015, Mustata was jailed for eight months in Spain for theft with violence.", "description": "Married dad Emil Mustata, from Romania, asked the woman if she was a prostitute and pretended to take pity on her before he raped her near his home in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire", "authors": ["Mark Naylor", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Humberside Police", "Scunthorpe Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652409.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Emil-Mustata.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
