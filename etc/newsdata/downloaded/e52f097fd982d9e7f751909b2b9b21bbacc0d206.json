Ito has said he was deeply sorry for \u201cbringing such a person into our network,\u201d while also disclosing that he had accepted $1.2 million from Epstein for personal investments.\n\nIto also stepped down from the board of The New York Times Company on Saturday, according to a spokesperson, who said in a statement that the resignation would be \u201ceffective immediately.\u201d\n\nIto\u2019s resignations come a day after the New Yorker revealed that the Media Lab\u2019s financial relationship to Jeffrey Epstein was more deeply entangled than what was previously known or Ito had disclosed to the public.\n\nMIT Media Lab Rocked by New Jeffrey Epstein Revelations\n\nIn a letter to members of the MIT community that was released to the public Saturday afternoon, university president Rafael Reif confirmed that Ito submitted his resignation, severing all ties with MIT.\n\nReif said he found the new details about Media Lab\u2019s financial ties to Epstein \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and has asked MIT\u2019s general counsel to hire a prominent law firm to help launch an independent investigation.\n\n\u201cBecause the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation,\u201d Reif said. \u201cThis morning, I asked MIT\u2019s General Counsel to engage a prominent law firm to design and conduct this process. I expect the firm to conduct this review as swiftly as possible, and to report back to me and to the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation, MIT\u2019s governing board.\u201d\n\nReif reiterated what he has previously said that accepting Epstein\u2019s gifts \u201cinvolved a mistake of judgement\u201d and an internal review of the processes and procedures is continuing.\n\nPhillip Faraone/GETTY More\n\nEpstein had been on a university list of \u201cdisqualified donors\u201d when Ito accepted some of the sex offender\u2019s donations. In one email, according to the New Yorker, Ito wrote of an Epstein gift, \u201cMake sure this gets accounted for as anonymous.\u201d One of his deputies reiterated the sentiment: \u201cJeffrey money, needs to be anonymous. Thanks.\u201d\n\nIn an email from October 2014 obtained by the New Yorker, Ito wrote that Epstein had directed a $2 million donation from billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. Peter Cohen, then a development official at the lab, wrote in a subsequent email, \u201cFor gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey\u2019s name as the impetus for this gift.\u201d\n\nIto told the New York Times that the New Yorker report was \u201cfull of factual errors.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Media Lab co-founder Nicholas Negroponte defended Ito\u2019s decision to take money from Epstein, MIT Technology Review reported he said at an internal meeting that he would accept the funds even now.", "description": "Phillip Faraone/GETTYThe director at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Media Lab has resigned after becoming embroiled in scandal over the lab\u2019s financial ties to mysterious multimillionaire and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \u201cAfter giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past", "authors": ["Anna.Kaplan Thedailybeast.Com", "Anna Kaplan", "Blake.Montgomery Thedailybeast.Com", "Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PT7PHUQwOuK4pUohsPOXRw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/881df6c61ce8c97084baf7eca329dfb1", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
