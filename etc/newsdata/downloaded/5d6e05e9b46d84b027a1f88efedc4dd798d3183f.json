Volker, a former career foreign service officer, pleaded in 2016 with Eliot A. Cohen and Eric Edelman, two former Republican officials leading a \u201cNever Trump\u201d letter-writing movement.\n\nTheir arguments were not wrong, Mr. Volker told them, as both sides remember it. But he argued that Donald J. Trump might actually win the election. And Mr. Volker, who had seen his foreign service career cut short after a new President Barack Obama swiftly removed him as the United States ambassador to NATO, was not going to blacklist himself from a senior post in another administration.\n\nHe got a lot more than he wanted.\n\nMr. Volker, who was President Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine until his abrupt resignation late last month, is today a central player in a political uproar that is threatening Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency with impeachment and contaminating American\u2019s relationship with Ukraine. It has also saddled Mr. Volker with legal bills and may force his resignation from another post, that of executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University, based in Washington. (A final decision had been postponed.)\n\nOne bright spot for Mr. Volker, 54, a serious-looking policymaker with wire-rim glasses and a thick crop of salt-and-pepper hair, is that he was to be married Saturday afternoon at Washington National Cathedral to Ia Meurmishvili, a journalist and television anchor for Voice of America\u2019s Georgian service. They met when he was her first guest on her television program; it is his second marriage.", "description": "Friends say that Mr. Volker, who was President Trump\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, was in an impossible situation.
