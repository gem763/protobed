Our consumer champion, Katie Morley, is here to help. For how to contact her click here.\n\nDear Katie,\n\nMy Dyson V8 Animal vacuum cleaner has packed up after three years. The battery cuts out within 40 seconds.\n\nI wrote to customer services to inquire about a replacement battery. I was told it would cost \u00a3770. The cost of a new V8 Animal is \u00a3350 and that includes many attachments, none of which I require. The only part I need is the battery.\n\nI should have thought that a company of the size and reputation of Dyson would want to offer a reasonable replacement? A battery life of three years is unacceptable. It has offered no apology. Dyson should be ashamed.\n\n...", "description": "Has a company treated you unfairly?", "authors": ["Katie Morley", "Consumer Champion", "Lauren Davidson", "Taha Lokhandwala"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/interiors/2018/08/31/Dyson-cordless-vacuum-cleaner-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq7jwX-Vo9a7DGCcPhYMaMmJy2GO-mp1ucNe98l3zwcDY.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
