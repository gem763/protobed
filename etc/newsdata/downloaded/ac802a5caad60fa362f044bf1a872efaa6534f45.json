The financial transmission rights would reward big power producers if they connect into less congested parts of the grid.\n\nThe council also has proposed renewable energy zones in which generators use a shared transmission network. They would contribute financially to investment in the shared transmission network for the renewable energy zone.\n\nIn return, generators would receive a long-term hedge that gives some guarantee about its financial return for making that investment.\n\nThe changes in how the grid operates have been driven by the rapid increase in solar and wind projects into the NEM, mostly in regional areas. The connection of these projects into the grid has been a headache for energy planners for years.\n\nClean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton said there was little doubt there was a need to modernise Australia's transmission network.\n\n\"Executives in the clean energy industry have rated both transmission access and grid connection as their highest priority over the last 12 months, highlighting the urgent need to address the issue,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"However, the reforms proposed by the AEMC are extremely complex and should not be rushed. It will take time to fully assess and implement the reforms.\"\n\nTransmission issues\n\nFederal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said transmission issues had been largely ignored in policy discussions and would be a focus of the next Council of Australian Governments energy council meeting in December.\n\n\"It is clear that changes are required in how transmission is delivered in the NEM,\" he said.\n\nThe concerns come as Northern Territory Energy Minister Dale Wakefield commissioned an independent review into the system blackout in Alice Springs on Sunday.\n\nPower was cut to the city of 30,000 people for more than eight hours.\n\n\"An investigation into the cause of the network outage is under way. I have made it clear to the chief executives of Territory Generation and Power and Water Corporation that this is unacceptable,\" Mr Dale said.\n\nThe Electrical Trades Union said it had warned Territory Generation for months about problems, saying the Ron Goodin power station, which had been closed prematurely, should be on standby as a back-up.\n\nAn APPEA report to be released on Tuesday will show the natural gas industry contributed $55 billion to the Queensland economy over the past seven years.", "description": "The Australian Energy Market Commission may struggle to implement its changes to transmission network rules by 2022.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_581%2C$y_187/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/601f8e5e006a52edcb4c131cdbc51c7b5c992bd2", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
