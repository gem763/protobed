Harris on the Success of \u2018Slave Play\u2019\u2014and Why He Doesn\u2019t \u2018Trust\u2019 Broadway on Race", "language": "en", "text": "Jeremy O. Harris, the playwright of Slave Play, presently Broadway\u2019s hottest ticket, was holding a Helmut Lang suit bag. It was the Saturday of New York Fashion Week, and inside the bag was his outfit for the Lang show, happening later that afternoon.\n\nThe handsome, multi award-winning playwright and actor met me in the lobby of his grand Lower East Side apartment building wearing a beautiful navy Thom Browne outfit (long jacket and shorts) and showed me (briefly) inside his new apartment, which is big and airy, and has a study where he will write. Harris, 30, apologized unnecessarily for his gravelly voice: \u201cMy voice sounds like I\u2019m in pain. Too much Fashion Week smoking, I\u2019m mortified.\u201d\n\nHis upstairs neighbor, he said, was Stephen Karam, playwright of The Humans, who asked him by text not to mention the actual name of the building. His phone pinged: \u201cOh cool, a friend might drop by to say hi.\u201d He multi-tasked checking messages, speaking to me, and eating lunch at a nearby Greek restaurant. Life for Harris, you sense, is quite the professional and personal whirl\u2014he also has a new boyfriend\u2014and he\u2019s relishing every moment. His Instagram account conveys this whirl in vivid pictures.\n\nThat week, the first preview performance of Harris\u2019 much-praised, much buzzed-about play would take place on Broadway. Harris hoped the fashion crowd would attend the show. An after-party, organized by the designer Telfar Clemens, attracted guests including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Lily-Rose Depp, Rose McGowan, and Hari Nef. Lucas Hedges and Gus Van Sant have been sighted in the stalls.\n\nAt another performance, Rihanna (whose \u201cWork\u201d plays at the opening of Slave Play) arrived late and then texted during the performance with Harris\u2014who tweeted in Rihanna\u2019s defense as online criticism rained down): \u201cThe patron saint of the play I wrote is literally a pop star, fashion icon, and Demi-goddess named Rihanna. When Dionysus is coming you hold the curtain.\u201d The texting was fine by Harris, as \u201cthere\u2019s no right or wrong way to watch the theatre.\u201d\n\nAnd so, even before its opening at the John Golden Theatre on Oct. 6 (to Jan 5, 2020), Slave Play is Broadway\u2019s hottest ticket, with celebrity and controversy productively entwined. \u201cExplosive, raw, and very funny\u201d: what this critic thought of Slave Play when it was at the New York Theater Workshop is there emblazoned on its Broadway marquee. This author still won\u2019t ruin the play\u2019s big surprise and its many other powerfully written and acted performances. You must see it.\n\nWhat Slave Play shows, in its brilliant whole, is the effects of racism and white supremacy on four sets of couples in a play that begins, seemingly, in the antebellum South. Slave Play won rave reviews (including one by me) when it played off-Broadway last winter. Harris also won the Paula Vogel Playwriting Award, the Lotos Foundation Prize, the Rosa Parks Playwriting Award, and the Lorraine Hansberry Playwriting Award. Perhaps Tony Awards will now follow.\n\nIn the spring Harris\u2019 play Daddy, again meditating on themes around race, sexuality, age, and exploitation\u2014starring Alan Cumming and Ronald Peet, and featuring a rippling swimming pool\u2014opened off-Broadway.\n\nThe success of Slave Play has made Harris a star, and he mused on the way to lunch that the experience has been \u201cdiscombobulating\u201d\u2014some of his friends, who knew him when he was couch-surfing in Los Angeles, have not known how to relate to him, the freshly laureled Broadway playwright.\n\n\u201c Success is not what you dream. Success can be the thing that can cause more depression than the basic poverty that you were in before. It may sound really insane to say, but when you have been in both places you feel it on a cellular level. Success can be insidious. \u201d \u2014 Jeremy O. Harris\n\nHarris himself describes the experience as \u201cwhiplash,\u201d even if he said he has been dreaming of Slave Play for a decade. His goal as a playwright is to have an impact\u2014so mission accomplished on that score. There had been a moment earlier this year when Harris did not know if he could write anymore, as he was trying to complete his thesis at Yale. This \u201cblock\u201d lasted for four months, enough time to \u201cfreak\u201d Harris out. (He has now graduated from the Yale School of Drama with an MFA in playwriting.)\n\n\u201cSuccess is not what you dream,\u201d said Harris. \u201cSuccess can be the thing that can cause more depression than the basic poverty that you were in before. It may sound really insane to say, but when you have been in both places you feel it on a cellular level. Success can be insidious.\u201d\n\nHis coping strategy has been to focus on the Slave Play cast, which is the same as it was off-Broadway except for Joaquina Kalukango entering the role of Kaneisha.\n\n\u201c I didn\u2019t write plays to be successful. I wrote plays to get a bunch of things out of my body. \u201d\n\n\u201cIf I had been a crazy success-monster,\u201d said Harris, \u201cI would have been, \u2018My play is going to Broadway. Get rid of everyone. Call Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway. Lupita Nyong\u2019o has to be the lead.\u2019 But the play began with family, and it was important to have the family here. They\u2019re my close friends and collaborators.\u201d That includes the play\u2019s dramaturg, Amauta Marston-Firmino, who is also his roommate, and \u201cable to keep me in line.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t write plays to be successful,\u201d said Harris. \u201cI wrote plays to get a bunch of things out of my body. When you become successful, even when it causes depression, you still have the hunger, the need, to stay successful\u2014and that can shift your priorities.\u201d\n\nSlave Play germinated after six years of living in Los Angeles, a time when Harris said he had described himself as a writer \u201cbefore I had written anything.\u201d He was reading a lot, imbibing influences and ideas, which eventually \u201cexploded\u201d on to the page when \u201cI realized I had a lot to say about my body. When you\u2019re a black body and queer body in L.A., there is an awful lot of othering that can happen.\n\n\u201cFrom that, Slave Play and Daddy came out in a flash. They were an amalgamation of different ideas that had been brewing in the back of my mind.\u201d For Harris, \u201cLos Angeles is one of the most segregated cities in our country. The Mexican guys in my neighborhood (Highland Park) felt I was an extension of all the white hipsters who had moved in. \u2018Here comes the black gay guy.\u2019 Everyone is in a hyperracialized mode in L.A. and no one knows it.\u201d\n\nIn Slave Play, the reverberations of white supremacy throughout history are vividly sketched. \u201cI wanted everyone in the audience to recognize how close that history is to our current illness,\u201d said Harris. \u201cGrowing up in Virginia and moving to the North, slavery has always been a fact to me. It wasn\u2019t a history that was far away from me. Like Kaneisha in the play, I was taken to plantations all the time. It was wholly part of our childhood. It was not lost on me that it was only five generations away. I want the play to take people to a place where they have to wrestle and reckon with this history.\u201d\n\nAs anyone who has seen Slave Play knows, it does more than just tell a simple story; it\u2019s wholly original, fizzing with ideas and challenge. It leaves an audience exhilarated, winded, and stimulated. It is not ordinary in any way; it is a piece of theater that stays with you\u2014and may well contribute to spearheading change on Broadway itself.\n\nHarris is enjoying his success. \u201cI don\u2019t know what having my feet on the ground is like because I am a Gemini,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m always running, floating, suspended, even when things are not going well. The flying high doesn\u2019t worry me, what worries me is my love of velocity\u2014my hunger to get to other places faster.\u201d\n\nSlave Play had its own \u201cstops and starts,\u201d as Harris put it. Last December he was \u201cpretty brazenly told\u201d that the play was bound for Broadway. \u201cI was like, \u2018What? That\u2019s insane.\u2019 I got really excited.\u201d\n\nIn Tulum for Christmas, he was reading \u201chorrible messages\u201d on Twitter from people criticizing the play, \u201cand they hadn\u2019t seen it,\u201d while getting phone calls about how close the production was to securing the theater. But it didn\u2019t happen\u2014at least at that moment. \u201cI got really upset, not because I didn\u2019t go to Broadway, but I got upset letting myself believe I could go to Broadway.\u201d\n\n\u201c Of course I\u2019m excited about being on Broadway, but Broadway is not the be all and end all of your career. There\u2019s so much more you can do, and actually there are a number of things about this space that make it more difficult to have the audience you want to build. \u201d\n\nThis initial misfire reminded Harris what he had really wanted for Slave Play in the first place\u2014being seen by new audiences, \u201cat a theater like the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn. So, of course I\u2019m excited about being on Broadway, but Broadway is not the be all and end all of your career. There\u2019s so much more you can do, and actually there are a number of things about this space that make it more difficult to have the audience you want to build.\u201d\n\nThe show doesn\u2019t have a star, Harris said, its budget is lower than other Broadway shows, but the first time around its success was built on excellent reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations. He hopes the same groundswell will build around the Broadway production. School kids and Broadway neighbors were invited to watch the dress rehearsal, and there will also be a performance just for an audience of color.\n\nWatching an audience, especially the various recognitions of audiences of color, respond to the play via the mirrors on the back of the stage has always been thrilling for Harris. \u201cAnd I like to think I am having a telepathic conversation with other black people as they watch it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 playwright grew up in Martinsville, Virginia, with his mom, who separated from his father when Harris was 11. She was a hairdresser and when he was young and his mom was training to be a hairdresser, she experimented on him. \u201cI always wanted long hair like the White Power Ranger.\u201d\n\nHarris choked up talking about how hard his mother worked for him; she is \u201creally over the moon\u201d for his success now. \u201cShe was 19 when she had me. She always treated me like a grown-up, not like a kid. I gave her advice on people she dated.\u201d\n\n\u201c It\u2019s not hard to have a woman\u2019s voice really clear in your head when you have sat at your mom\u2019s foot every day for 18 years, as well as all the women in the salon where I was a fly on the wall for so long. \u201d\n\nThe strength of Kaneisha\u2019s voice and presence, and the mother in Daddy, are rooted in the strength of Harris\u2019 own mother. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to have a woman\u2019s voice really clear in your head when you have sat at your mom\u2019s foot every day for 18 years, as well as all the women in the salon where I was a fly on the wall for so long, working on the front desk, when most of the other boys were outside playing. What I picked up on most was the specific rhythms of how black women speak.\u201d\n\nAs a little boy, Harris read a lot, he fabulated, and was very well behaved. \u201cI had to be. It was only me and my mom. I felt a real responsibility not to muck up her life.\u201d He was \u201cbullied everywhere, sometimes because I was gay and also my mom didn\u2019t let me play in the sandbox till I was 4 or 5. It made me a priss and set me apart.\u201d\n\nHarris has always written, and made people feel uncomfortable with his writing, he said, laughing. In fifth grade, he wrote about a violent robot. That story also included the line \u201cYou\u2019re a real prick,\u201d which scandalized his teachers. \u201cMy mom let me watch movies. It wasn\u2019t a bad word.\u201d I asked if he missed having a dad. \u201cI\u2019m still processing those feelings,\u201d said Harris. \u201cI was very fulfilled with my mom, but there were times where it was weird to have friends who had conventional nuclear families. That was the unfortunate reality.\u201d\n\nHe made out with girls and liked girls, preferring them to boys in many ways. Will & Grace, the pop culture model of gayness of that moment people pointed toward, didn\u2019t fit with Harris when he came out at 19. He thought he might be bisexual. He didn\u2019t fancy conventionally cute guys but smart guys, which confused him for a long time. His mother was \u201clovely\u201d when he came out.\n\nHarris has always been hard on himself; when he did not finish college (DePaul, where he studied theater), he gave himself until the age of 30 to be successful as a writer, \u201cor I\u2019d go back to school and become a lawyer. And I did it.\u201d\n\nHarris worked in Chicago and Los Angeles as an actor, and before Slave Play and Daddy (written during a MacDowell Colony residency), Harris wrote Water Sports; or, Insignificant White Boys and Xander Xyst, Dragon 1 with musician Isabella Summers. His Instagram and Twitter accounts buzz with his strongly held views and great pictures of him sporting distinctive fashion.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times last year, Harris said a potential theater-goer could see a picture of him wearing one of his distinctive outfits and \u201csee a bit of themselves in a code I\u2019m wearing. I\u2019ve just invited someone into the theater who didn\u2019t know that it was for them.\u201d\n\nWatching Kalukango as Kaneisha, going from clowning around to silence to \u201cperforming an aria,\u201d has reminded Harris how much he loved acting.\n\nHe laughed. \u201cI want some space to fail, so maybe I\u2019ll do a big play and fail as an actor. \u2018As we see, Jeremy O. Harris can\u2019t act,\u2019\u201d he said, intoning a reviewer\u2019s imagined words. \u201cYeah, I can\u2019t do everything, and it might actually be freeing to know that I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAs we readied to leave so he could go home and change before the Helmut Lang show, Harris smiled and read an email from playwright Adrienne Kennedy, whom he has long admired and whose plays he wants to bring to Broadway. While hailing his success, she told him to \u201cbe careful\u201d of the attention and fame he was receiving.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s not changed. I can\u2019t trust it. I can\u2019t trust the people who have been in power for 10, 20, 30-plus years and who have not cared about the black bodies represented as authors and creators, and not just bodies on stage. I can\u2019t trust that they\u2019re genuine or they care about making change. \u201d\n\nHarris himself is \u201cvery dubious\u201d about all the hype around the black plays on and off Broadway, \u201con the heels of all the critics who said how amazing all the black work was last season. Wait a second: We have a lot of amazing writers\u2014didn\u2019t you know that?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not changed. I can\u2019t trust it. I can\u2019t trust the people who have been in power for 10, 20, 30-plus years and who have not cared about the black bodies represented as authors and creators, and not just bodies on stage. I can\u2019t trust that they\u2019re genuine or they care about making change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see the changes happening not just for me but also Jackie (Sibblies Drury), Michael R. Jackson, and Aleshea (Harris), who are being written about by all these white critics. But we need a diverse set of critics across the board, a diverse board of directors for all these theaters. There were more black plays on Broadway in the 1970s than there have been this decade. That\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nWas he optimistic? Harris paused. \u201cCaution is more necessary than optimism right now\u2014in everything that we do.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Slave Play\u2019 playwright Jeremy O.
