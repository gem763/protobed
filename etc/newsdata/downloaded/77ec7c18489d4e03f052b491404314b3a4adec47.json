Washington can't let him get that free Sunday. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter an enormous second-half collapse at Philadelphia in Week 1, the Washington Redskins need a victory at home Sunday to keep their season from an early downward spiral. The problem: They face their other top NFC East rival, the defending division champion Dallas Cowboys, who trampled the New York Giants in their season opener.\n\nWashington goes into this game a sizable underdog, which makes sense based on Week 1\u2019s second half, an offensive line trying to pull itself together, injuries on defense and to running back Derrius Guice and tight end Jordan Reed, and the fact that Dallas did a great job of controlling both sides of the line against New York.\n\nHere are five keys for the Redskins against the Cowboys, who are 7-3 against Washington in Jay Gruden\u2019s tenure as the Redskins\u2019 coach:\n\nForce turnovers\n\nFor much of last season, the Redskins held a sizable turnover advantage. It was a key reason they jumped to a 6-3 start and were leading the NFC East before quarterback Alex Smith broke his leg. Last Sunday, neither Washington nor Philadelphia was able to force a turnover. After the game, Coach Jay Gruden complained that the defense\u2019s inability to take the ball away kept the Eagles on the field for long, clock-consuming drives.\n\n[Terry McLaurin spent his college days preparing for the unexpected. In the NFL, it\u2019s paid off.]\n\nSeveral of the Redskins\u2019 players and coaches talked this week about an emphasis on getting turnovers. Given the way Dallas\u2019s offensive line can control the game, the Redskins need to force quarterback Dak Prescott to make mistakes. The absence of defensive lineman Jonathan Allen won\u2019t help matters there.\n\nKeep letting the young receivers fly\n\nLast week, rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin debuted with five catches for 125 yards, including a 69-yard touchdown. The coaches were so excited about McLaurin this summer that they made him a starter and cut 2016 first-round pick Josh Doctson. They hid McLaurin for most of the preseason, but the Cowboys won\u2019t be as surprised by him as the Eagles were.\n\nWith tight end Jordan Reed, the team\u2019s top pass-catching threat, out again with a concussion, McLaurin and the other young wideouts \u2014 Trey Quinn and Kelvin Harmon \u2014 will become even more vital to the offense.\n\nContain Ezekiel Elliott\n\nLast year, the Redskins beat visiting Dallas, 20-17, by holding Ezekiel Elliott to 33 rushing yards in one of the worst games of his career. When they played again a few weeks later, Elliott ran for 121 yards in the Cowboys\u2019 31-23 home win. Some of that production was the result of the recently acquired Amari Cooper\u2019s eight catches for 180 yards, but the pattern is clear: Contain Elliott and you take away what Dallas likes to do best.\n\nElliott was sluggish last weekend, running for 53 yards after coming back from his summerlong holdout. But the Cowboys\u2019 line is so good and Prescott was incredibly accurate in finding Cooper and second-year wide receiver Michael Gallup that it won\u2019t take much for Elliott to be Elliott again.\n\n[Inside the four drives that doomed the Redskins in their loss to the Eagles]\n\nCut out offensive line penalties\n\nThe Eagles trampled the Redskins in the second half, but Washington\u2019s offense did its defense no favors by going three and out on its first three possessions after halftime. Each of those drives was compromised by a penalty by an offensive lineman. Similar problems hampered the offense last year, especially in the season\u2019s second half, when injuries left Washington piecing together its line.\n\nThe Redskins have had to throw together another line amid the holdout of star left tackle Trent Williams, signing tackle Ereck Flowers and moving him to left guard and bringing in Donald Penn to play tackle. It hasn\u2019t been the disaster many have feared. The linemen have talked a lot about \u201ccleaning up\u201d the mistakes from last week, but those will have to be fixed fast.\n\nStop DeMarcus Lawrence\n\nEven when Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence isn\u2019t sacking the quarterback, he is dangerous \u2014 and disruptive. Last week, he was everywhere in the Giants\u2019 backfield, forcing bad throws and cutting off the running game. Washington quarterback Case Keenum did a good job of avoiding the pass rush last week, but he might have to be even better Sunday if the line can\u2019t stop Lawrence.\n\nMore on the Redskins:\n\nAnalysis: The Redskins say they have a great defensive line.
