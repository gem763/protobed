For the Financial Times the main issue was trade flows. They could be cut in half if it happens. The BBC went with the danger of criminals exploiting gaps in preparedness. Always a good one that. Here at the Independent, we focused on the issue of timing: ministers have run out of it, and now there's no chance of improving a pretty dire situation.\n\nAs I read the report I was reminded of a Jackson Pollock painting. Your eye is drawn to a splash of red at the bottom right, or the prominent splats of yellow that sort of make up a triangle, because you need to find an anchor somewhere to cope with the seething chaos in front of you. Devastating doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Well you know the answer: no sight nor sound of this detailed study. In some of the darker corners of the internet you\u2019ll find people muttering darkly about Remainer conspiracies and calling for searches of the personal effects of those working at NAO towers to see if they uncover Liberal Democrat membership cards.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The NAO doesn\u2019t do politics. It\u2019s staffed by pointyheads who draw conclusions from the evidence they\u2019re presented with. Facts: those inconvenient things that keep on getting in the way.\n\nThe NAO points out that the government says only between 30 per cent and 60 per cent of traders will be \u201cready for Brexit\", as the slogan goes \u2013 in part because of the vast burden of red tape they\u2019re being asked to handle, and have been putting off. What\u2019s telling about that is the range. It\u2019s so large it\u2019s basically nothing more than a guesstimate. Nobody really knows. We are told this is a worst case scenario. To that I\u2019d say, how often do these \u201cworst case scenarios\u201d end up proving relatively optimistic when it comes to major projects in Britain?\n\nThe image of Eurosceptics chuntering about \"Brussels bureaucracy\", when they\u2019re dumping tons of it on the entrepreneurs they fetishise, is just one of so many ironies they\u2019ve become a sort of Brexit background noise.\n\nFor example, the report says the government admits the situation at our borders will be \u201cless than optimal\u201d for a time. That\u2019s rather like describing a heart attack as a \"temporary suspension of beats\". I detect the hand of Michael \u201cbumps in the road\u201d Gove.\n\nGove, who\u2019s in charge of no deal planning, is said to want a deal despite his posturing, and that no deal ad campaign which, this report makes clear, has proven singularly ineffective. If that\u2019s true he has good reason to.\n\nIf the government is serious about inflicting a no deal gut punch on the British people \u2013 and parts of Conservative Party certainly are \u2013 it will obviously seek to ramp up the blame game when the \u201cla la la\u201d brigade has woken up to the harsh reality of what\u2019s going to be going on at Dover, at Calais, on the shelves of the supermarkets, and on the lives of people like me who need drugs.\n\nWhen this comes to pass, the government will need scapegoats on this side of the English Channel. There\u2019s no way you can completely avoid taking some of the responsibility for the events this report warns of. So if I was Gove, I\u2019d be on the phone to my former boss, Rupert Murdoch, to enquire about employment opportunities at Fox News.\n\nNo wonder there are reports this morning that the government will comply with the Benn Act, after all. The more sensible parts of Boris Johnson's administration know that inflicting this on the British people will kill the Tories off for good \u2013 a minor consolation to those who survive the mess, because it\u2019ll be the winter of discontent times 1,000.\n\nGove and his chums desperately need time, but even that might not save them.", "description": "The latest damning no-deal Brexit report from the National Audit Office was a treat for the media \u2013 by which I mean that part of it still\u00a0committed to reporting news, as opposed to pro-Brexit propaganda.", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/16/Gove-Marr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
