Yes, unquestionably, would be my answer.\n\nGreat teams and great performances are only possible when you have special players working in tandem and what you saw on Saturday was the vast majority of that England team producing their best-ever performances in an England shirt. When that happens collectively, it\u2019s unstoppable.\n\nWhen making this assessment I only feel qualified to talk about matches I have personally witnessed, because only then can you pick up the circumstances and vibe of a game. Because of that, I can\u2019t really throw into the mix games such as England\u2019s first ever victory in New Zealand in 1973 or South Africa in 1972.\n\nMaro Itoje was rock solid, both as a ball carrier and off the ball in tackling and at the breakdown\n\nEngland were on the front foot throughout and won comfortably despite two disallowed tries\n\nSIR CLIVE: MY TOP FIVE ENGLAND GAMES 1) England 19 New Zealand 7 (2019) I\u2019ve never seen England perform better against world-class opposition. They played at an exhilarating pace and with discipline and what with those two disallowed tries it could easily have been a 25-point winning margin. 2) Ireland 6 England 42 (2003) This was the best performance of that Martin Johnson team. Ireland were going for the Grand Slam and so were we after three near misses. This was clearly a huge hurdle that needed to be cleared and I ramped it up all week. \u2018Guys if we can\u2019t win with panache and style then we have no chance in the World Cup.\u2019 They responded brilliantly, taking them apart in the second half. 3) Ireland 20 England 32 (2019) This was the template for England\u2019s demolition of New Zealand on Saturday. From the off they ripped into Ireland, playing at a higher pace than we had ever seen. Manu Tuilagi announced his return, Mako Vunipola was off the scale and Tom Curry truly gave notice of his world-class talent. It would be no exaggeration to say that Ireland still haven\u2019t recovered from this crushing defeat. 4) England 24 France 7 (2003) Our best performance at the 2003 World Cup by a long way. We didn\u2019t panic when Serge Betsen went in for an early try and dominated the next 70 minutes on a difficult rainy night. Our back row was superb, Jonny Wilkinson kicked all 24 points and a very good French team didn\u2019t get a sniff. What should have been a tense night was a breeze. 5) Scotland 18 England 30 (1980) The background is important. England hadn\u2019t won a Grand Slam for 23 years and we had set ourselves up for a shot at glory with a torrid 9-8 win over Wales. We then had to stew for a month \u2014 the schedule was leisurely in those days \u2014 before going up to Murrayfield to try to finish the job. A tough assignment but we blitzed the Scots, scoring five tries. The high point of the great era of Fran Cotton, Tony Neary, Roger Uttley et al.\n\nThe other thing to note is the important difference between greatest performance and greatest achievement. Beating Australia to win the 2003 World Cup was that team\u2019s crowning moment and greatest achievement but it was nowhere near their best performance.\n\nEngland on Saturday are top of the pile for so many reasons.\n\nFirstly, the circumstances of the game. A World Cup semi-final against the world\u2019s No 1 team, a side looking to win their third consecutive World Cup. Indeed, New Zealand hadn\u2019t lost a World Cup match since the 2007 quarter-final against France. The stakes were incredibly high, which brings a need to perform at your very best \u2014 which builds the pressure. Not all sides can perform under that kind of pressure.\n\nAt the heart of England\u2019s display was the tempo they played the game at, best shown in that opening 97 seconds leading to Manu Tuilagi\u2019s try. New Zealand never under- estimate any opponent but even they could not have expected England to be that quick out of the blocks, to play and pass and think at that pace. Up to now, that has been the preserve of New Zealand.\n\nEngland can only do that because they are finally the fittest team in the world again. Our success in 2003 was based on Olympic-level fitness but somewhere along the line England lost that. It\u2019s a topic for another day but everybody started to bulk up, there was too much emphasis on the power game and perhaps players also struggled with the demands of club and country.\n\nEddie always talks about his love of England\u2019s big beasts but he is also aware of the need for supreme fitness. This England pack is exceptionally mobile and fit as well as fearsome. Skilful, too. Some of their passing and off-loading on Saturday was sublime. We see it at club level but over the years we have become conditioned to think England will keep those skills under wraps in the big games. Not this time.\n\nThen there was the variety England offered. They hit New Zealand from every angle. They matched and surpassed them for pace and tempo but with George Ford pulling the strings at 10 they still teased the New Zealand back three with a succession of clever kicks deep and into the corner. Suddenly even a phenomenal talent like Beauden Barrett was struggling to influence the game\n\nThe tackling? Extraordinary, and crucial. I\u2019ve said that I believe England are now the best tacklers in Test rugby, that they have adapted quickest to the new tightening of the law, but on Saturday it was fundamental to their game plan.\n\nIt was crucial that they never let New Zealand settle, that they drove their dangerous runners back time and time again, won the breakdown, won the penalty.\n\nNew Zealand stacked the lineout with four recognised jumpers yet England bossed it \u2014 save for that one loose ball that gifted New Zealand their try. You can have too much choice \u2014 in the end it\u2019s one jumper and his lifting pod against another.\n\nEngland put their bodies on the line and coped with pressure from New Zealand superbly\n\nLineout coach Steve Borthwick ensured England\u2019s two options, Maro Itoje and Courtney Lawes, were rock solid and gave Itoje a license to roam and poach on New Zealand\u2019s throw.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s consider the impact of the win, the shockwaves it sent around the rugby world. I bumped into a few ex-All Blacks, players and coaches, on Saturday night and they were in a state of shock.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that New Zealand had been so outplayed \u2014 to a man they acknowledged that with grace and generosity \u2014 but it was the complete nature of England\u2019s performance.\n\nEven Sir Clive's optimism ahead of Saturday's semi-final clash didn\u2019t see this one coming!\n\nEngland captain Owen Farrell will lead his country in a Rugby World Cup final next Saturday\n\nThere was a real feeling among the Kiwis that the All Blacks would have to go back to the drawing board, that the brand of rugby which had seen them rule the world for the last 10 years was no longer fit for purpose.\n\nEngland had caught them and overtaken it.\n\nThe challenge now for England is to replicate this near-perfect performance in the final. That\u2019s what must drive them on this week.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: Was Saturday's World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand England's greatest ever performance?
