Alex Ellinghausen\n\nBut Treasury also warned of risks from extreme monetary policies such as \"excessive growth in asset prices, including house prices\" and difficulty unwinding the measures.\n\nThe 13-page July 29 ministerial submission for Cabinet discussions was released on Friday night and reveals thinking inside Treasury about record-low interest rates, fiscal stimulus and the possibility of the RBA resorting to a bond buying program known as \"quantitative easing\".\n\nThe advice was delivered after the RBA had cut the cash rate for the second straight month in July to 1 per cent, before it fell to a record low of 0.75 per cent this month.\n\nTreasury head of macroeconomic modelling and policy division, Ian Beckett, noted there was a \"material prospect\" that the cash rate could hit the effective lower bound (publicly estimated by the RBA to be 0.25-0.50 per cent) and the RBA \"may need to consider unconventional policies\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Intense pressure' on bank margins\n\nTreasury said the monetary policy transmission will become \"impaired\" and banks' profit margins will \"come under more intense pressure\" as the RBA cash rate falls towards zero.\n\n\"It may even become necessary for the RBA to consider policies to improve the transmission of [monetary] policy cuts even before the cash rate reaches zero,\" Mr Beckett noted.\n\n\"Given that Australia's financial system is dominated by bank lending to households it is likely the Bank [RBA] would first consider options aimed at lowering bank funding costs or supporting mortgage funding directly.\"\n\nDiscretionary tax cuts or spending increases are highly effective at supporting aggregate demand if monetary policy is constrained. \u2014 Treasury\n\n\"This would involve either buying commercial bank bills or residential mortgage backed securities.\"\n\n\"The latter may be particularly attractive as the RBA already holds these assets as collateral as part of its existing operations.\"\n\nThe banks have progressively passed on less and less of the June, July and October rate cuts of 0.25 of a percentage point each.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout two-thirds of bank funding comes from customer deposits, a portion of which are zero-cost or pay extremely low interest rates.\n\nBut because the banks cannot practically drop deposit rates below zero, their net interest margins are squeezed as they reduce their lending rates in concert with the RBA's cash rate moves.\n\nMr Beckett noted that even at rates above zero bank profits get \"squeezed as lending rates decline relative to this zero-interest source of funds\".\n\n\"Banks with a high share of retail deposits in their funding mix, such as Australian banks, will likely face greater pressure on their profits,\" he said.\n\nRBA: QE is 'unlikely'\n\nRBA governor Philip Lowe has said QE is \"unlikely\" but \"possible\".\n\nHe has said the most likely form of QE in Australia would be buying government bonds, to lower the \"risk-free\" borrowing rate that influences borrowing costs across the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTreasury noted purchasing Commonwealth or state government bonds would be \"lower risk\", but they would likely be a less effective stimulus. This is because \"governments are unlikely to respond directly to lower interest rates\", and few private borrowers have their rates directly linked to government bond yields.\n\nWestpac chief economist Bill Evans said the supply of government bonds was limited at about $600 billion, with the supply likely to fall as the government budget returns to surplus.\n\n\"Locking up a substantial portion of the available bonds on the RBA\u2019s balance sheet might be counterproductive,\" Mr Evans noted.\n\n\"It is reasonable to expect that if RBA QE applied to RMBS there would be considerable stimulus to supply lowering funding spreads and providing the RBA with a sharp boost to its monetary accommodation objectives.\"\n\nRMBS are a package of debt-based securities backed by the interest paid on home loans, which non-bank lenders sell to investors to fund home loans and trade in financial markets.\n\nTreasury said more risky assets, such as corporate bonds or special purpose \"QE infrastructure\" bonds, could be bought by the bank. But it downplayed the possibility by noting this would be more complex, take longer to develop and have unintended consequences.\n\nFiscal stimulus?\n\nWhen the cash rate was at 1 per cent, Treasury noted that when short-term interest rates approach their \"effective lower bound\", unconventional monetary policies or the use of fiscal policy may be called for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Mainstream economic thinking suggests discretionary tax cuts or spending increases are highly effective at supporting aggregate demand if monetary policy is constrained.\n\n\"Australia is not currently in these circumstances but we are closer than we have been previously.\"\n\nMr Morrison and Mr Frydenberg have rejected calls for a budget stimulus, committing to deliver a budget surplus this financial year.\n\nTreasury advised that in the future more government spending support or tax cuts could be considered, because extreme monetary policies can have the side-effects of pushing up house and share prices to risky levels, risking financial stability and potentially requiring \"macroprudential\" supervision from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and RBA.\n\n\"Unconventional monetary policies are worthy of consideration when conventional space has been eroded, but they are somewhat less direct, can have larger wealth effects through asset prices and can be difficult to unwind,\" Mr Beckett wrote.\n\n\"As such, fiscal policy can play a greater role when monetary policy is constrained.\"\n\nLabor criticisms\n\nShadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the Treasury documents were \"more evidence that Josh Frydenberg has no idea what he is doing\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDespite receiving advice months ago that showed how remarkable and unusual unconventional monetary policy would be, Josh Frydenberg has done nothing to change course on the floundering economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cScott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have recklessly left the Reserve Bank to do all the heavy lifting in the face of worsening home-grown economic challenges and increasing global risks.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury advice was written when Philip Gaetjens was the department's secretary. He is now head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and was recently succeeded by Steven Kennedy as Treasury secretary.\n\nDr Kennedy said last week monetary policy remained a better response than fiscal stimulus to generate economic growth, but also warned Australia needs more structural reform.\n\nDr Kennedy said a fiscal stimulus could be called on in a \"crisis\", such as during the 2008-09 global financial crisis when the Rudd-Gillard governments loosened the government's purse strings.\n\nMr Morrison in October accused the banks of profiteering by not passing on the full quarter percentage point cut in the official cash rate.\n\n\"The banks are basically profiteering,\" Mr Morrison said, \"The public will judge them but I am not buying it.\"", "description": "Treasury's warning to Josh Frydenberg that bank profit margins will be \"squeezed\" by the RBA's ultra-low interest rates undermines the Morrison government's claims the banks are profiteering.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1886%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3cb061175b7cc4ee44aa7c5b80b7c1c070679794", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
