Negotiators from the world\u2019s top two economies meet in Washington on Thursday in the latest effort to hammer out a deal.\n\nTurkey launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria, President Tayyip Erdogan said, adding the offensive was aimed to eliminate a \u201cterror corridor\u201d along the Turkish border.\n\nAnalysts said the attacks could affect the economy of the oil-producing Kurdistan region in Iraq and boost energy prices.\n\nPrices pared gains after U.S. President Donald Trump said the assault on Syria was \u201ca bad idea\u201d not backed by his administration.\n\nAlso pressuring prices, U.S. crude inventories grew 2.9 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, more than double analysts\u2019 expectations for an increase of 1.4 million barrels.\n\nU.S. crude oil production rose last week to a record of 12.6 million barrels per day.\n\n\u201cWeakening oil demand concerns were further supported today by a larger than expected increase in U.S. crude stocks,\u201d said Jim Ritterbusch, president of oil trading advisory firm Ritterbusch and Associates. \u201cDemand from the refiners has seen a larger seasonal decline than widely anticipated.\u201d\n\nU.S.-China trade tensions rose this week as Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and placed some Chinese companies on a blacklist.\n\nChina\u2019s comments late on Wednesday mitigated hopes for a deal to end the long-running trade war after reports in Bloomberg and the Financial Times had spurred optimism for a deal.\n\n\u201cCrude oil has, just like other riskier assets, received a boost from news that China is open to accept a partial trade deal,\u201d Saxo Bank commodity strategist Ole Hansen said.\n\nCommerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said if the U.S.-China talks fail, \u201cthe oil price risks suffering a renewed slide because concerns about demand would then increase considerably again, especially looking ahead to the coming year.\u201d", "description": "Oil futures were mixed on Wednesday as a Turkey-launched offensive in Syria and hopes of progress in ending the U.S.-China trade war supported oil, but a build in U.S. crude inventories held prices back.", "authors": ["Laila Kearney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438654773&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9801Z", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
