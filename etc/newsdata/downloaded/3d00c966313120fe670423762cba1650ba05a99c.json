The update purported to decrease the presence of popular games in Steam\u2019s recommendation algorithms, increase overall variety, and give people a more personalised selection of games.\n\nHowever, the update appears to have produced some unintended ripple effects, especially for games that aren\u2019t out yet. Now some developers are saying the trickles of traffic their game pages were getting before have now dried up almost entirely.\n\nOver the weekend, a bunch of indie developers voiced their concerns on Twitter, posting graphs of their plummeting wishlist stats and citing sudden drop-offs in store page traffic. The developers of atmospheric puzzle-platformer Unbound: Worlds Apart kicked it off with their own graph of users\u2019 wishlist numbers, which is not moving in a promising direction:\n\nImage: Unbound: Worlds Apart\n\n\u201cThank you Steam for killing indie gaming,\u201d wrote Unbound\u2019s developers.\n\nMark Viola, the creator of tactical turn-based JRPG Bright Red Skies, lamented similar data, writing, \u201cNoticed a huge drop as well.\u201d\n\nImage: Bright Red Skies\n\nScourgeBringer developer Thomas Altenburger called the new update a \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d saying that his rogue-lite platformer\u2019s daily wishlisting dropped by 66 per cent\u2014an \u201call time low.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonths of effort, ruined in an instant,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOther developers reached out to Kotaku with similar stories. \u201cOur impressions and wishlists have dropped 80% since the change, and it\u2019s a similar story with tons of others,\u201d Alex M-O, a developer on action-platformer Rune Fencer Illyia, told Kotaku on Twitter.\n\n\u201cOur upcoming game went from 30-40 wishlists daily to negative numbers today,\u201d said Failcore Games founder Jan Cieslar. \u201cThanks to the changes, more people are deleting [the game from] their wishlists than adding them. And it\u2019s Steam who tells us to set up a page as soon as possible and prioritise wishlists if we want to succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur traffic and wishlists [dropped] to 20% of the normal one, and the conversion from view to wishlist has also dropped to 50%, which means they are showing our games to people from other niches or people who already saw them,\u201d said Lowpoly Interactive founder Bogdan Radu.\n\nBoth store page impressions and wishlists are extremely important predictors of Steam games\u2019 success, especially upcoming ones. The value of page impressions is pretty self-explanatory, but when users wishlist games, they receive notifications from Steam when the game comes out, as well as every time it goes on sale. That way, it doesn\u2019t get lost in Steam\u2019s ceaseless howling vortex of a shuffle. Wishlists are generally regarded by developers as the most effective way of making a game sell to its fullest potential when it comes out.\n\nThe developers who say their games have entered flaming traffic talespins have something in common: Their games aren\u2019t out yet. A couple of developers behind games that are already out have said that their internal Steam stats are in a holding pattern or slightly up.\n\nStill, that\u2019s done little to comfort the developers, who\u2014in addition to their own long-term marketing efforts \u2014 had been relying on Steam\u2019s recommendations to pull in pre-release wishlists.\n\n\u201cFor example, a game like Hollow Knight,\u201d wrote the developers of Unbound. \u201cIn the \u2018More Like This\u2019 section from the game page, they put only popular games and no smaller games. Moreover, games that will be launched in the near future are currently inexistent there, and this section brings the biggest organic traffic.\u201d\n\nI took a look at the version of the store Steam algorithmically generated for me and found this to largely be true. I had to scroll for multiple minutes through the recommendations section to find a game I didn\u2019t recognise or that had failed to achieve some degree of high-profile success. While I did come across a couple compelling indies in the \u201cMore Like This\u201d sections of recent cult hits like Hypnospace Outlaw and Wandersong, even many smaller games\u2019 \u201cMore Like This\u201d widgets were dominated by indie mega-hits, well-known classics, and barely-related triple-A games. Unreleased games, meanwhile, were nowhere to be found.\n\nIn a statement to Kotaku, Valve said that the update is \u201clikely\u201d to undergo further changes, but they may not necessarily be directed at this particular issue. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring the effects of the changes now that they\u2019ve been deployed on a larger scale, and we\u2019re reviewing the mix of feedback from all sources,\u201d said a Valve representative in an email.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say what changes will be made, but new features and tweaks are always likely after initial release.\u201d In the meantime, indie developers with upcoming games on Steam are left in the cold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty clear pattern,\u201d said M-O. \u201cUpcoming games are given negative priority for visibility. \u2018More Like This\u2019 is roughly 50% relevant best-sellers, 50% non-relevant best-sellers, and a random [triple-A game] or two ... It\u2019s comedically opposite to their stated intention.\u201d", "description": "Last week, Valve released an update as part of a recent push to make it easier for users to find new, under-the-radar games.
