Montagny 1er Cru \u201cLes Bassets\u201d 2016/2017; Louis Jadot Domaine Gagey Bouzeron 2016; Maison Chanzy Bouzeron Clos de la Fortune Monopole 2016; Domaine de la Folie Rully Clos la Folie Monopole 2017; and Maison Louis Latour Mercurey Rouge 2016. (Stacy Zarin Goldberg/For The Washington Post)\n\nBurgundy is the lodestar of pinot noir and chardonnay. The region\u2019s heartland is the Cote d\u2019Or, and burgundy fiends love parsing the terroirs of the Cote d\u2019Or\u2019s two subregions. The Cote de Nuits to the north includes the storied vineyards of Gevrey-Chambertin, Chambolle-Musigny, Vougeot and Vosne-Romanee. The Cote de Beaune begins just north of the city of Beaune and extends south through Pommard, Volnay, Meursault and the Montrachet sisters, Puligny and Chassagne.\n\nThe Cote d\u2019Or, or golden slope, gets its name from the sunlight that bathes the east-facing slopes during the growing season, but it may just as well refer to the price of the wine. Even village wines, bearing just the names of those towns on their labels, command a hefty price. Move up the hierarchy established over the centuries, to single-vineyard wines awarded the status of premier cru or grand cru, and the prices soar accordingly.\n\n[To heighten wine\u2019s flavors, you need the right glass. But you only need one.]\n\nBurgundy has other districts, of course. Chablis, to the north, nudging Champagne, specializes in chardonnay. Prices range from quite reasonable to lofty. In the south, the Macon supplies many a French bistro with a house white, delicious chardonnay at comfortable prices.\n\nAnd just south of the Cote de Beaune is Burgundy\u2019s \u201cThird Cote,\u201d the Cote Chalonnaise. The villages here \u2014 Rully, Givry, Mercurey, Montagny and Bouzeron are the main ones \u2014 are peasants compared with the royalty to the north. And yet, they offer terrific wines for the price.\n\n\n\nLouis Jadot\u2019s vineyard in Bouzeron, in the Cote Chalonnaise region of Burgundy, France. (Kurt Eckert/Maison Louis Jadot)\n\n\u201cThe Cote Chalonnaise is the best value in Burgundy today,\u201d says Decanter magazine columnist Steven Spurrier. He keynoted a session on the Chalonnaise as Burgundy\u2019s Third Cote at this year\u2019s International Pinot Noir Celebration in Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley. Spurrier, who helped put California on the world wine map by organizing the famous Judgment of Paris tasting in 1976, noted that Chalonnaise winegrowers may be benefiting from the warming climate, which is helping grapes ripen more evenly and reliably than in previous vintages.\n\n[Snag this juicy, French white wine for just $9]\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: These wines are not cheap. Chalonnaise bottles cost between $25 and $50. Value doesn\u2019t always mean inexpensive. While not matching the thrill of top burgundies, Chalonnaise wines are delicious and relatively affordable. They are great candidates for your holiday dinner parties, family occasions or even personal vindication celebrations on a really bad day.\n\nThey are also hard to find. Their inferior status compared with wines of the Cote de Nuits or Cote de Beaune dampens market demand. Retailers may be skeptical and put these bottles on the lower shelf or the far edges of the burgundy section. The wines may be easier to find on restaurant lists, at least when sommeliers are searching for relative bargains. So look for these town names on labels, and be willing to explore Burgundy\u2019s third slope.\n\nThree major burgundy producers \u2014 Faiveley, Louis Jadot and Louis Latour \u2014 have invested heavily in the Cote Chalonnaise and are names to look for. Maison Chanzy, Domaine de la Folie, Antonin Rodet and Chateau de Chamirey are also making delicious wines.\n\n[Wine-speak 101: Key terms to help you find the bottle of your dreams]\n\nIn my recent tastings, I was most enthusiastic about the whites. I enjoyed a stunning chardonnay from Domaine de la Folie in Rully, in the northern Chalonnaise near Chassagne-Montrachet. Further south, in Montagny, I was blown away by the minerally energy of wines from Louis Latour and Laurent Cognard.\n\nThe wines of Bouzeron, an appellation devoted exclusively to the aligot\u00e9 grape, are also standouts. Traditionally blended with cassis to make the aperitif kir, aligot\u00e9 shines in Bouzeron, where it exhibits some of the fleshiness of white burgundy, restrained by a mineral core.\n\nPinot noir from this region tends to be on the rustic side, a little rough on the edges but with fine flavors of dark cherries and truffles characteristic of the grape. Mercurey is the main appellation for pinot noir, with Faiveley and Louis Latour producing delicious examples that do indeed show sophistication. Givry, just to Mercurey\u2019s south, is the smallest of the appellations in the Chalonnaise. The pinots here tend to be juicy and well, fun, for lack of a better word.\n\nI\u2019ve used the word \u201cpeasants\u201d to describe these wines, and I\u2019m not alone in my sentiment. In the newly released eighth edition of \u201cThe World Atlas of Wine,\u201d the British writers Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson call these wines \u201cundernourished cousins\u201d of the more famous wines of the Cote de Nuits and Cote de Beaune.\n\n[Here\u2019s the price range in wine where you can find the best quality]\n\nBut this perspective compares the wine of the Cote Chalonnaise with the very best of Burgundy. Perhaps that\u2019s not the best point of view. Compared to wines in the $10 to $20 range, these are a definite step up in quality. They give true Burgundy character at a fraction of the price of that storied region\u2019s top wines. They are worth seeking out, on retail shelves or restaurant lists. And are worth the splurge.\n\nHere are five of my favorites from recent tastings of Cote Chalonnaise wines.\n\n\u2014 Dave McIntyre\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nLouis Jadot Domaine Gagey Bouzeron 2016\n\nBurgundy, France, $27\n\nAligot\u00e9, chardonnay\u2019s nearly forgotten cousin in Burgundy, was traditionally blended with cassis to make a kir cocktail. When treated with respect, it makes a delicious wine, lighter in body than chardonnay, but with the same mineral and terroir aspects of white Burgundy. The Domaine Gagey from Louis Jadot is expansive and fruity, yet that mineral core shows through on the lengthy finish. Alcohol by volume: 12.5 percent.\n\nImported by Kobrand, distributed by RNDC: Available in the District at Calvert Woodley, MacArthur Beverages, Rodman\u2019s.\n\nDomaine de la Folie Rully Clos la Folie Monopole 2017\n\nBurgundy, $35\n\nBeautifully expressive, with a perfect balance of fruit, oak and terroir, this chardonnay should stand proud among more famous (and more expensive) white burgundies. The label explains the name \u201cFolie\u201d as coming from an ancient belief that the nearby forest was a hideout for spirits. This wine sure is spirited. ABV: 13.5 percent.\n\nImported by Vintage \u201959, distributed by Winebow: Available in the District at Connecticut Avenue Wine & Liquor, Rodman\u2019s, Schneider\u2019s of Capitol Hill. Available in Maryland at Bradley Food & Beverage in Bethesda, Downtown Crown Wine and Beer in Gaithersburg, Rip\u2019s Wine and Spirit Shop in Bowie. Available in Virginia at Dominion Wine and Beer in Falls Church.\n\nLaurent Cognard & Co. Montagny 1er Cru \"Les Bassets\" 2016/2017\n\nBurgundy, $46\n\nLithe, nimble and electric, this chardonnay seems to be channeling energy from within the earth. I tasted the 2016; the importer has recently introduced the 2017. Laurent Cognard also produces a less expensive (and less expressive) chardonnay whimsically called \u201cLe Chard\u201d and a pinot noir. ABV: 13.5 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by Winebow: Available in the District at Rodman\u2019s, Schneider\u2019s of Capitol Hill, Wide World of Wines. Available in Maryland at Bradley Food & Beverage in Bethesda, Wine Cellars of Annapolis in Annapolis, Wine Source in Baltimore.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nMaison Chanzy Bouzeron Clos de la Fortune Monopole 2016\n\nBurgundy, $24\n\nThis aligot\u00e9 from Maison Chanzy shows the care given to a wine produced from a single estate-owned (monopole) vineyard. The emphasis here is on mineral structure and less on fruit. ABV: 12.5 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by Winebow: Available in the District at Rodman\u2019s, Schneider\u2019s of Capitol Hill. Available in Maryland at Bradley Food & Beverage in Bethesda. Available in Virginia at Bottle Stop in Occoquan.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nMaison Louis Latour Mercurey Rouge 2016\n\nBurgundy, $25\n\nThis is a lovely \u201cvillage\u201d wine, one step up the hierarchy but at the same price as many wines labeled \u201cBourgogne.\u201d Aromas of truffles and autumn leaves, flavors of dark cherries and plums \u2014 all pinot noir signatures \u2014 are held together by noticeable, though not overbearing, acidity. This wine is light enough to drink with casual meals but substantive enough to enjoy with hearty, fancier foods as well. ABV: 13 percent.\n\nImported by Louis Latour Inc., distributed by M. Touton Selection: Available in the District at Eye Street Cellars, Rodman\u2019s. Available in Maryland at Beer, Wine & Co. and Bradley Food & Beverage in Bethesda; Bin 201 Wine Sellers in Annapolis; Bin 604 Wine Sellers, Canton Crossing Wine + Spirits and Wine Source in Baltimore; Decanter Fine Wines in Columbia; Frederick Wine House and Old Farm Liquors in Frederick; Hop N Grape in North Bethesda; Pine Orchard Liquors in Ellicott City; World Gourmet Wine & Beer in Potomac.\n\nAvailability information is based on distributor records.
