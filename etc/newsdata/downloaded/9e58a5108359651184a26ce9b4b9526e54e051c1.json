USA TODAY\n\nLANDOVER, Md. \u2014 Jay Gruden was alone as he walked off the field Sunday afternoon, possibly for the last time as the head coach of the Washington Redskins.\n\nAs owner Dan Snyder and team president Bruce Allen made an uncharacteristically hasty exit from FedEx Field following Washington's 33-7 loss to the New England Patriots, piling into black luxury vehicles in the bowels of the stadium, Gruden was left to answer questions about whether he would still have a job this time next week.\n\n\"Nobody\u2019s told me anything,\" Gruden said. \"If the key works on Monday, I\u2019ll keep working.\"\n\nGruden's future in Washington has been on shaky ground since the summer, even before the Redskins fell to 0-5 for the first time since 2001. Now, however, they have lost 11 of their past 12 games dating back to last season. Their defense has been consistently porous. They've played three different quarterbacks, all with little success. And their home games have felt increasingly like road contests, with visiting fans outnumbering those in burgundy and gold on a weekly basis.\n\nMany fans point the finger at Allen, who has by and large been the final decision-maker when it comes to personnel. Others have called for the Redskins to fire defensive coordinator Greg Manusky, given his unit's lackluster performance.\n\nBut ultimately, it could be Gruden, the affable 52-year-old head coach, who will be the one to be shown the door. He has only led the Redskins to one playoff appearance in his five-plus years at the helm and produced an overall record of 35-49-1, making him an easy target.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been provided ample opportunities to succeed around here,\" Gruden said. \"I\u2019ve got good players, I\u2019ve got a good staff. We just haven\u2019t produced on Sundays, or Monday. So (we\u2019ve) got to do better.\"\n\nLANDOVER, MD - OCTOBER 06: Head coach Jay Gruden of the Washington Redskins looks on against the New England Patriots during the first half at FedExField on October 6, 2019 in Landover, Maryland.

He arrived in Washington in 2014 as someone who had grown accustomed to winning \u2014 claiming four Arena Football League championships as a player and two more as a coach. In his 22 seasons in coaching prior to joining to the Redskins, his teams made the playoffs 18 times.\n\nThen Gruden joined the Redskins, a team that has become better known for its dysfunction than postseason success, and all of that changed.\n\nThough he has helped navigate the franchise through a string of rocky moments \u2014 the transition away from Robert Griffin III and the abrupt departure of former general manager Scot McCloughan, for instance \u2014 Gruden has seen his teams finish within two games of .500 in each of the past four seasons.\n\nWidely regarded as a players' coach, Gruden still has plenty of support in the locker room. Running back Chris Thompson, for instance, became visibly emotional when asked about his head coach's seemingly tenuous job security, tears dripping down his cheeks.\n\n\"I really care about Jay, and... it\u2019s just, it\u2019s tough, man,\" said Thompson, who has played all but one season of his career under Gruden. \"I feel like he was one of the guys that really believed in me.\"\n\nOthers believe that, after an 0-5 start, it's clear that something needs to change \u2014 on the coaching staff, or otherwise.\n\nCornerback Josh Norman declined comment when asked if he thinks the current coaching staff is the right group to lead the team forward. Running back Adrian Peterson, meanwhile, said the staff bears responsibility for evaluating the team's issues but that players also are accountable for the outcome.\n\n\"The coaches make their calls, and it\u2019s our job to go out there and execute and do the best with the position they\u2019re putting us in,\" Peterson said. \"And, for whatever reason, this is the fifth week we haven\u2019t been able to get it done.\"\n\nGruden, for his part, said he does not intend to make any changes to the coaching staff. He doesn't believe a new defensive coordinator or wholesale changes to the team's scheme would fix anything at this point \u2014 especially \"with all the new people we have around here and some of the injuries we have piling up.\"\n\n\"Consistency is going to be good,\" Gruden said. \"We're going to have to perform better and do a better job.\"\n\nAnd so, as he left FedEx Field on Sunday evening, Gruden planned to do what he's always done. Watch the film. Work on the game plan for next week's matchup against the equally-listless Miami Dolphins. Get back to the facility, and back to work.\n\nAssuming, of course, that his key still works.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "description": "After the Redskins dropped to 0-5, questions about Jay Gruden's job status continued to swirl around the embattled coach and his team.", "authors": ["Tom Schad", "Published P.M.
