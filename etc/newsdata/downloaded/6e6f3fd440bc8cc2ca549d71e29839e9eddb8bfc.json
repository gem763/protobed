The experience is similar to equine therapy, with one game-changing difference: horses tend to stand, but cows spontaneously lie down in the grass while chewing their cud, allowing humans to get even more up close and personal by joining on the ground and offering a warm embrace.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But cows? You can\u2019t take them with you.\n\n\u201cCan you see how quiet she gets?\u201d says Suzanne Vullers, 51, an equine therapist who co-owns the bed-and-breakfast with her husband Rudi Vullers, also 51. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the person and the cow.\u201d\n\nHailing from the rural town of Reuver, in the Netherlands, the pair came across \u201ckoe knuffelen\u201d, which means \u201ccow hugging\u201d in Dutch, on a return visit to their homeland two years ago. In parts of the Netherlands, cow cuddling is offered as part of half-day visits, and is part of a larger movement to connect people with country life. In the major urban centre of Rotterdam, a newly opened floating dairy farm in the city\u2019s oldest port invites city dwellers to visit the beasts.\n\nAbout a decade earlier, in 2007, the couple \u2013 he a former supply chain manager, she a former accountant \u2013 traded their corporate lives to set up their farming shop in Naples (population: 2,500. Claim to fame: a grape festival that takes place in the autumn, with a competition for grape pie). The idea of cow cuddling opened the barn gates.\n\nThe cows get to live a natural life \u2013 they aren\u2019t production animals and they\u2019re not raised for beef or dairy\n\nIn May of 2018, they purchased Bonnie and Bella, selecting them for their gentle personalities and lack of horns. \u201cA lot of cows are not suited for it,\u201d Rudi says. \u201cThey can chase you out of the field.\u201d\n\nHour-long cow-cuddling sessions, priced at \u00a360 per couple for the hour, are capped at two a day, with a maximum of four participants per session. \u201cIt\u2019s not a petting zoo,\u201d says, though the animals are indeed pets in a sense \u2013 they aren\u2019t production animals, and they\u2019re not raised for beef or dairy. \u201cThese girls get to live a natural life,\u201d Suzanne says.\n\nEach session is overseen by two human counterparts: an equine therapist, usually Suzanne, who can read the animals\u2019 moods to ensure a safe, positive interaction with their new human friends, and a second handler, who keeps a watchful eye on the other animals in the field.\n\nNeither has a psychology degree, which is kind of the point: \u201cWhatever they\u2019re going through, they don\u2019t have to talk about it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like [conventional] therapy, right?\u201d\n\nClothing is important \u2013 they might slobber on you\n\nLike other forms of therapy, the hope is for visitors to foster trust, empathy and connection with the cows and their own emotions. And as with any other kind of therapy, there are no guarantees of successful outcomes: \u201cThey\u2019re not trained to lie down,\u201d she says.\n\nOn a recent Saturday, two pairs of people, an engaged couple from Silicon Valley and a mother-daughter duo from upstate New York, had travelled from opposite sides of the country to cuddle some cows.\n\n\u201cDrive five hours to hug a cow?\u201d says Karen Hudson, 57, a construction company manager, who attended the afternoon session with her daughter, Jessica Ercoli, 27, a probation officer.\n\nFor Hudson, it\u2019s a sort of wish fulfilment, a throwback to the fond memories of visiting her grandmother\u2019s farm. And perhaps a bit of fate, too. The email address she has used for over two decades includes the words \u201cMissy\u201d, which happens to be the name of miniature horse on the farm, and \u201cmoo\u201d.\n\nLeading the two excited but tentative women onto the field, Suzanne offers guidance on a successful approach before demonstrating the methods herself. \u201cO posture, not X posture,\u201d she says. \u201cRound the body\u201d to appear less threatening. Walk up to the cow\u2019s shoulders rather than its haunches.\n\n\u201cClothing is important,\u201d Rudi says. \u201cThey might slobber on you.\u201d (Definite requirement: closed-toe shoes.)\n\nFor observers: \u201cStand sideways. It makes a world of difference to them,\u201d Suzanne says.\n\nAdvice for participants: \u201cRespect them and their world and what they want to do and what they want to give you,\u201d she adds.\n\nNumber one advice for everyone: remain calm. \u201cThe more relaxed you are, the better it will be for you and them,\u201d Suzanne says, because horses and cows alike sense emotions and respond in kind \u2013 most of the time.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rub your snot on me!\u201d says Ercoli to Bella.\n\nColin Clover, 50, a recruiting manager at Facebook attending the morning session, stumbled upon this extracurricular activity the way that many people discover niche wellness trends: the internet. He knew his fiancee Alexandria Rivas, 31, a receptionist, artist and longtime equestrian enthusiast, had fond memories of visiting the dairy farm next to the college she attended.\n\nThough he had once trained dolphins and sea lions, the idea of sidling up to a 900lb (400kg) heifer intimidated him. The nerves subsided, he says, when Suzanne framed it in a way he understood. \u201cThink of how you would interact with your dog,\u201d he recalls her saying.\n\nIn their separate sessions, the pairs have a chance not just to meet the cows, but the entire coterie of characters. In the barn and field: Jaxon, the 1,800lb stallion; Stetson, a gelding, named for the hat; Cricket and Noa, mares rescued from abusive conditions; Suzie Q and Missy, miniature horses with distinct personalities. \u201cMissy is always the first to say hi,\u201d explains Suzanne of her outgoing, plump-bellied friend.\n\nFor the final surprise of the day, the farmers invite the visitors to hand-feed the cows oat-based treats, which many participants describe as their favourite activity. Even though, Hudson says, the cows\u2019 tongues \u201cwere like sandpaper!\u201d\n\nStill, it was better than a different kind of surprise: \u201cSometimes cows drop things,\u201d Suzanne says.\n\nPerhaps recognising they are in polite company, the cows only drop themselves. Lowering to the ground, they offer participants what they\u2019ve travelled across state and country to experience: a chance for a warm embrace.\n\n\u00a9 New York Times", "description": "Even without a psychology degree, Bella\u2019s natural talents made her an excellent therapist: she is calm and accommodating of a range of personalities, with the patience to listen to endless problems without so much as a judgmental moo.", "authors": ["Elisa Mala"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/16/15/cow-cuddling-2.jpg"}
