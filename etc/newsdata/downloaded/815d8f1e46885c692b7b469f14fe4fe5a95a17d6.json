You don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good people with dicks out there, you\u2019ve just got to find them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up, you don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good dicks out there, you just have to find them\u201d \u201cI always thought I had to be gay because all guys are evil but that\u2019s not true\u201d \u2013 @MileyCyrus what's good? pic.twitter.com/y3yjUGpCSN \u2014 \u2022 (@bljcmie) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a dick that\u2019s not a dick, you know? I always thought I had to be gay, because I thought all guys were evil, but it\u2019s not true,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere are good people out there that just happen to have dicks. I\u2019ve only ever met one, and he\u2019s on this live.\u201d\n\nThe comments sparked a backlash from progressives and LGBT activists, who accused Cyrus of perpetuating the idea that sexuality is a choice.\n\nMiley, this is so not it. Women don\u2019t \u201chave to be gay\u201d because they \u201ccan\u2019t find a good person with a d*ck\u201d.\n\nDon\u2019t use the queer community as a stop-gap because you couldn\u2019t find a boyfriend.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t queer because they \u201cgave up\u201d on men.\n\nThis is so insulting. pic.twitter.com/lAzcEjHRcB \u2014 Rosie Percy (@rosiepercy) October 21, 2019\n\nDamn. In 30 seconds @MileyCyrus managed to burn up all goodwill she'd ever built with queer and trans people. Not all \"guys\" have dicks, Miley. Thought you knew better. You \"had to be gay\" because men are bad? Do you not realize what an anti-lesbian trope that is? Gross. \u2014 James Bradford's Undead Corpse (@jamesebradford) October 21, 2019\n\nMiley really had to go and say some dumb shit about being gay pic.twitter.com/wkP4LwdEi2 \u2014 \u064b\u064b (@iforgiveyiew) October 21, 2019\n\nCyrus, who has previously declared herself both \u201cpansexual and gender fluid,\u201d responded to the controversy on Monday, claiming that she was \u201ctalking shit about sucky guys\u201d and reiterating her support for the LGBT agenda.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cYOU don\u2019t CHOOSE your sexuality. You are born as you are. It has always been my priority to protect the LGBTQ community I am a part of. Happy Monday!\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the former Disney alum described herself as a \u201cnew age\u201d queer who was \u201credefining\u201d relationships and making gender \u201cirrelevant\u201d with her marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re redefining, to be fucking frank, what it looks like for someone that\u2019s a queer person like myself to be in a hetero relationship,\u201d she explained at the time. \u201cWhat I preach is: People fall in love with people, not gender, not looks, not whatever. What I\u2019m in love with exists on almost a spiritual level. It has nothing to do with sexuality \u2026 gender is a very small, almost irrelevant part of relationships.\u201d\n\nDespite marrying last December, Hemsworth filed for divorce from Cyrus in August after just seven months, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d in their relationship.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The singer and progressive activist Miley Cyrus came under fire for saying she once thought she \"had to be\" a lesbian because \"all guys are evil.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/mileycyrussmokeshop1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
