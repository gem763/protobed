At the skill positions, Mark Ingram, Carlos Hyde, Terry McLaurin, and Larry Fitzgerald all finished in the top 30 at their respective positions. It would have been six but James White, one of our \"start\" picks, was stopped at the goal line on one play (not that we're bitter or anything).\n\nMeanwhile, six of our \"sits\" picks finished outside the top 30 at their respective positions. We were burned by Carson Wentz, Phillip Lindsay, and Mike Williams producing better-than-expected numbers in fantasy.\n\nCheck out our start 'em, sit 'ems for Week 7 below.
