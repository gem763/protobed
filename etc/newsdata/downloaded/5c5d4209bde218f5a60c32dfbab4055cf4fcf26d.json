A team spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.\n\nCoach Mike Thibault said on Thursday he was optimistic his team could pull together, even without Delle Donne\u2019s presence on the court, but acknowledged the 30-year-old first-round draft pick would be \u201ca huge weapon out of the lineup if she doesn\u2019t play\u201d.\n\nThe Mystics and Sun are tied 1-1 in the series and play on Sunday in Connecticut.", "description": "The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) Finals head into Game Three on Sunday with an air of uncertainty, as it remains unclear whether the sport's brightest star will play in the matchup between the Connecticut Sun and Washington Mystics.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437513926&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940MU-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
