The quality of education depends on principals,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nMa, who celebrated his retirement in September and received the Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award last week, also said that he would now be dedicating his time and fortune to education and philanthropy.\n\n\n\nHe stressed the education system will need to evolve for children to stay relevant in a digital age where creativity, imagination and independent thinking abilities are the most highly sought-after qualities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also should cultivate children to learn to face failure, to tackle problems and to explore the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs such, principals should be equipped with abilities not merely in teaching, but school management and allocation of useful teaching resources. Countries should make elementary education a priority as it is during this phase that children develop their interests, core values and basic abilities,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAmong the attendees of the conference was Ji Xiaonan, a student from the high school affiliated to Renmin University of China who shared her thoughts about elementary education. Ji spoke about the discussions with her international peers about the future of elementary education during her exchange program in the United States this summer.\n\n\n\nShe recalled that a peer from the United Kingdom told her that the schools can improve their e-learning offers so that educational resources can be more updated and efficient. Meanwhile, a student from Japan said that schools should shift their focus from exams to having a global citizenship education. A student from South Korea also suggested that schools should allow students to go home earlier as long school days can be overly stressful.\n\n\n\n\u201cI call for school leaders to build a diversified, professional educational environment that respects each student\u2019s interest and personality, nurtures their leadership and critical thinking ability, as well as brings happiness,\u201d said Ji.\n\n\n\nEstablished in 1990, the International Confederation of Principals organizes annual gatherings for school leaders around the world to network, collaborate and share practices that will initiate positive change and enhance outcomes for students across the globe.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db14946a310cf3e97a2c560.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
