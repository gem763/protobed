Attorneys on several sides of the two cases invoked Hopkins\u2019s 1988 case during oral arguments.\n\nAD\n\nAs in Hopkins\u2019s case, the contemporary cases hinge on how broadly the justices define gender stereotyping, said Deborah Dinner, a law professor at Emory University who specializes in the legal history of gender and work.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe stereotype is that a male should dress in a certain way or perform his gender identity in a particular way or should have romantic relationships with women and not men,\u201d Dinner said. \u201cAnd so by discriminating on the basis of somebody\u2019s gender identity or on the basis of their sexual orientation, what an employer in fact is doing is discriminating on the basis of a gender stereotype.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Hopkins told the Supreme Court that she had been the only woman out of 88 candidates for partner in 1982. Supporters of her candidacy had highlighted that she secured the firm\u2019s most valuable contract, a multimillion-dollar project with the State Department.\n\nAD\n\nSome of Price Waterhouse\u2019s partners, however, described her as \u201covercompensated for being a woman\u201d and criticized her use of profanity. The male boss who told Hopkins her candidacy was on hold suggested that she \u201cwalk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear makeup, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHopkins resigned from Price Waterhouse and started working at the World Bank. Attorneys for Price Waterhouse told the Supreme Court that the company had passed over her for partner because she had poor interpersonal skills, including being abrasive with office staff.\n\nThe court ruled 6 to 3 that an employer had to show that its hiring decisions were not based on sex stereotyping. A company that takes adverse employment action against a woman because of the belief that women should not be aggressive, for example, has inappropriately used gender to motivate its decision.\n\nAD\n\nFederal laws forbidding employers from discriminating against people because of their sex also are meant to ban treating men and women differently based on sex stereotypes, Justice William Brennan Jr. wrote in the majority opinion, quoting an earlier case.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAn employer who objects to aggressiveness in women but whose positions require this trait places women in an intolerable and impermissible Catch-22: out of a job if they behave aggressively and out of a job if they do not,\u201d Brennan wrote. \u201cTitle VII lifts women out of this bind.\u201d\n\nA subsequent decision by a lower-court judge forced Price Waterhouse to make Hopkins a partner and give her more than $370,000 in back pay. She rejoined the company and worked there until 2002. In other people\u2019s employment disputes, companies now needed to be able to show that they would have made the same decision about a worker if gender had not been a factor.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI had no choice but to sue,\u201d Hopkins told The Washington Post in 1988. \u201cI had to do this as a matter of principle. It was inevitable and predictable. I did not set out to be a leader.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Price Waterhouse ruling created a foundation for future court cases, said Katherine Turk, a history and gender studies professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Transgender and non-binary people had a new basis to argue that discriminating based on sexual identity is just another way to enforce the display of gender stereotypes at work.\n\nDavid Cole, an attorney for a woman who says she was fired from a funeral home because she told the owners she was transgender and would transition, told the Supreme Court justices Tuesday that his client\u2019s case addressed the same issue as Hopkins\u2019s case and should be resolved the same way.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn firing her for failing to conform to its owner\u2019s explicitly stated stereotypes about how men and women should behave, it discriminated against her in the same way that Price Waterhouse discriminated against Ann Hopkins for failing to walk and talk more femininely,\u201d Cole said.\n\nAD\n\nHopkins, who died last year, wrote in her 1996 memoir that she wondered how her career would have been different had she been a partner at Price Waterhouse before a court ordered it.\n\n\u201cWould I have risen higher in the ranks to a position where I could have more effectively influenced the firm to cherish diversity?\u201d she wrote in wrote in \u201cSo Ordered: Making Partner the Hard Way.\u201d \u201cWould some of the men I worked for have been working for me? I don\u2019t know. What I do know is I never compromised on what I valued or believed.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Ann Hopkins, who was denied a promotion at the former Price Waterhouse accounting firm, won a major workplace-discrimination case.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0Y_uZemKwqEtvvzeBxJMuPw9UvA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HHUMBUHJ4AI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
