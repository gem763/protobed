So we are actually helping the Dutch problem rather than making it worse \u2014 so why do we get the blame?\u201d\n\nThe government called in the military to block key intersections in downtown The Hague to prevent farmers reaching the commercial and political center of the city, which is the seat of the Dutch Parliament.\n\nLarge camouflage trucks carrying shipping containers were deployed at major roads.\n\nThe farmers are angry at recently announced government plans to reduce emissions, particularly of nitrogen. They argue that the government\u2019s plans are based on inaccurate readings and calculations by the government-funded National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. The institute disputed that in a statement, calling its nitrogen measuring \u201crobust and scientifically responsible.\u201d\n\nThe farmers started their demonstration at the central city of De Bilt, where the institute has its headquarters, before heading to The Hague.\n\nThere, they gathered around a small stage to listen to music and speeches from farmers and politicians. Some farmers managed to drive their tractors through parts of the city, while others blocked tram tracks near the central railway station.\n\nThere were no reports of violence.\n\nMayor of The Hague Johan Remkes appealed to the farmers to stick to agreements about where they could protest \u2014 meaning they had to stay out of the town center.\n\n\u201cIgnoring agreements is unacceptable and dangerous for residents and shoppers,\u201d he said, warning residents to take extra care amid the traffic disruptions.\n\nFarmers by the hundreds parked on a large grassy field just outside the city center and police effectively turned the main highway into the city into a tractor parking lot. Some farmers even drove along the North Sea beach, parking there and coming into town on busses, police said.\n\nTheir lobby is powerful because of the economic significance of agriculture to the Dutch economy. The Dutch farmers\u2019 organization, LTO, says exports from the country\u2019s nearly 54,000 farms and agriculture businesses were worth 90.3 billion euros ($98.3 billion) last year.\n\nBut it comes at an environmental cost, with farms emitting carbon and nitrogen.\n\nEarlier this month, the Dutch government announced a raft of measures to rein in nitrogen emissions, including a voluntary program to buy up old, inefficient farms and subsidies to help other farms modernize.\n\nOther measures take aim at the country\u2019s construction and transport industries, which also are responsible for emissions.\n\nOne tractor in The Hague bore a sign saying simply: \u201cNo farmers. No food. No future.\u201d\n\nAnd at the demonstration, Jeroen van Maanen of the Farmers Defence Force told the crowd: \u201cThe farmer is always part of the solution.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMike Corder reported from London.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of climate change issues at https://www.apnews.com/Climate .", "description": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Dutch farmers, many driving tractors, poured into The Hague on Wednesday to protest government moves to rein in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/d0d17e_aptopix-netherlands-farmers-protest-53612-protesting-farmers-gather-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
