They met as teenagers in the 1970s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My dad moved from Jamaica to NW London as a child in the 1960s, while my mum was born and bred in London to a mixed-European family. My maternal grandfather was one of around 200,000 displaced Polish troops who settled here after WW2.\u2019\n\nKristel doesn\u2019t love the term \u2018mixed-race\u2019, but she uses it \u2013 while acknowledging its flaws \u2013 for lack of a better alternative.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an imperfect term,\u2019 says Kristel. \u2018I know some people aren\u2019t comfortable with it, or prefer to use alternatives (often on the basis that \u201crace\u201d is a social rather than scientific construct).\n\n\u2018It\u2019s crazy to think that in the not-so-distant past our very existence was seen as an abomination, yet today people of mixed heritage are the fastest-growing minority group in the UK.\n\n\u2018That isn\u2019t an excuse for complacency, and racism is still very real and ever-present, but it\u2019s a nice big middle-finger to the eugenicists at least.\u2019\n\n\u2018As a teenager, I remember being really conscious of trying to have a balance of white and non-white friends \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to look as though I was \u201cpicking sides\u201d\u2018 (Picture by Jerry Syder for Metro.co.uk)\n\nKristel says that none of her grandparents, on either side, were particularly thrilled by her parents\u2019 union, but they came around eventually.\n\n\u2018My parents had a really good run of it and were together for more than 30 years, but are now happily divorced,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018A lot of their disagreements seemed to stem from fundamental differences in how they wanted to raise a family, and culture played a big part. My siblings and I were often in the middle of that tug-of-war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018On one side you had my dad with his West Indian style, tough love. On the other, you had my mum with her more laissez-faire approach to discipline.\n\n\u2018I think my dad also found it a bit frustrating that my mum couldn\u2019t empathise with some of the things he came up against as a black man. At the same time, my mum was definitely subject to a lot of patriarchal nonsense from him.\n\n\u2018Basically, they had very different world views.\n\n\u2018Seeing that dynamic has definitely made me pretty pragmatic and maybe a bit unsentimental. Love across culture and colour lines can be wonderful, but there also needs to be mutual respect and understanding of where you\u2019re both coming from \u2013 especially if you plan to bring children into the picture.\n\n\u2018I think my dad found it a bit frustrating that my mum couldn\u2019t empathise with some of the things he came up against as a black man\u2019 (Picture: Kristel Tracey)\n\n\u2018You can come at things from different perspectives but it\u2019s so important to try to make sure you\u2019re on a similar page.\u2019\n\nThis is particularly pertinent for Kristel as she is due to give birth \u2013 at some point this month \u2013 and will be welcoming her first child with her partner, who is also mixed-race.\n\n\u2018My partner is Italian and Moroccan,\u2019 says Kristel.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about how to raise our child with a really assured sense of self in a world that still largely likes to see things in binaries, and a country that seems to be regressing in its attitudes to who gets to claim Britishness.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKristel says that people in her life are already curious about how her unborn offspring might identify, and what they\u2019ll look like.\n\n\u2018We just want to raise them to understand as much as they can about all aspects of their heritage, but not feel as though that has to define who they are, or what\u2019s expected of them.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s easier said than done though \u2013 the fact is, most people struggle with questions of identity at one point or another. I\u2019m curious to see how our child will navigate that, and I hope to create an environment where they feel they can talk to us about it openly.\n\n\u2018I hope they\u2019re able to embrace the richness and diversity of their heritage and family history, rather than feel overwhelmed by it.\u2019\n\nKristel knows what it\u2019s like to grow up feeling somewhat out of place. She says that feeling can stem from the way other people perceive you.\n\n\u2018I think a lot of the difficulty comes from a disconnect between how you might identify and how others identify you, which totally varies according to the room you happen to be in,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018As a mixed-race person, there can be a lot of external judgement or assumptions made around the \u201ctype\u201d of mixed-race person you are, and which side you identify more with, based on pretty superficial stuff \u2013 the company you keep, the people you date, the type of music you like, the way you talk etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m too old and have less f***s to give nowadays, but I definitely tussled with this growing up.\n\n\u2018For example, as a teenager, I remember being really conscious of trying to have a balance of white and non-white friends \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to look as though I was \u201cpicking sides\u201d or be accused of being a \u201ccoconut\u201d.\n\n\u2018Being mixed-race will have afforded me access to spaces or privileges that come with being seen as embodying blackness in a more \u201cpalatable\u201d form\u2019 (Picture: Kristel Tracey)\n\nKristel doesn\u2019t often experience racism in open, overt ways, but she says she feels it in all the little things, all the time.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s microaggressions, comments that make me feel uncomfortable, feeling hypervisible or invisible in certain spaces,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s stuff like \u2013 not getting into clubs when you\u2019re in a non-white group, being followed around shops by security guards, walking into a village pub and being gawped at as though you just landed from Mars, or feeling undermined or underestimated in professional settings.\n\n\u2018Sometimes it\u2019s hard to put a finger on exactly why \u2013 is it because of my race, class, gender or a combination?\u2019\n\nShe says it is the slipperiness of this kind of covert racism that makes it so hard to identify, and even harder to call out.\n\n\u2018Racism in the UK is often insidious and hidden under a thin veneer of politeness,\u2019 Kristel tells us.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s terribly inconvenient to point it out, which is why those who do are often silenced, shouted down or told to \u201cstop playing the race card\u201d.\n\n\u2018It makes it difficult and daunting to speak up about it, even when you broach it \u201cpolitely\u201d \u2013 look at this furore with Naga Munchetty as one example.\n\nOn the other side, Kristel has no problem acknowledging her privilege as a mixed-race person with some white heritage. Something she things more mixed-race people should be willing to do.\n\n\u2018I have no doubt that being mixed-race in a world that judges you according to your proximity to whiteness has also had a bearing on my experiences,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018Colourism is real, and I know that being mixed-race will have afforded me access to spaces or privileges that come with being seen as embodying blackness in a more \u201cpalatable\u201d form.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve felt it most overtly when it comes to dating as a woman, where I\u2019ve experienced being fetishized or exoticised for my mixed heritage while darker-skinned friends have been overlooked or outright disrespected.\n\n\u2018I find it particularly wild that some of the most ardent deniers or unapologetic perpetrators of colourism I\u2019ve come across have been dark-skinned, black men.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t really understand why some people are reluctant to talk about colourism or acknowledge its existence.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s healthy to check our privileges or try to unpick the harmful things we\u2019ve internalised, whatever that might be \u2013 whether that\u2019s based on gender, race, class, being able-bodied, cis-hetero or any other factors.\u2019\n\n\u2018To me, Jamaican culture feels like a warm hug and a belly laugh\u2019 (Picture: Kristel Tracey)\n\nKristel says she has had significantly more exposure to the Jamaican side of her heritage growing up, and she says it was a comfort to be in those spaces after spending large portions of her upbringing in majority white areas.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really close to my Jamaican grandmother and spent a lot of time with her growing up, so she\u2019s had a pretty big impact on me. To me, Jamaican culture feels like a warm hug and a belly laugh.\n\n\u2018Despite being as white as I am black, I\u2019ve never seen my whiteness as something I can really \u201cclaim\u201d. I think the way you look as a mixed-race person can have a pretty dramatic impact on the way you\u2019re received by wider society.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not white-passing, and the one-drop rule is alive and kicking, so I\u2019ve always felt more comfortable in black or multicultural environments.\u2019\n\nThe \u201cone-drop\u201d rule is the archaic historical principle of racial categorisation originating in the US in the 20th century that said that one drop of \u2018black blood\u2019 meant a person was black.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only reason why Kristel doesn\u2019t have the same level of connection with her European heritage.\n\n\u2018My Polish grandad passed away when I was young and I didn\u2019t spend much time with my maternal grandma,\u2019 she explains. \u2018There are so many questions I wish I could\u2019ve asked them, instead of having to fill in the blanks between the fragments I\u2019m able to extract from my mum and aunts.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been to Poland and Switzerland, but aside from a love of cabbage-based food and appreciation of Swiss efficiency, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve felt much of a personal connection as I might like to.\u2019\n\nKristel doesn\u2019t agree with the idea that being mixed-race has to feel isolating.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re either assumed to bridge gaps or to exist within the gaps,\u2019 says Kristel. \u2018I\u2019ve personally found it incredibly enriching \u2013 I appreciate every aspect of my ancestry that led to me being right here, right now and honour that by trying to live as fully as possible.\n\n\u2018Being mixed-race is just one aspect of my identity, albeit a significant part.\n\n\u2018I also love that there is no easy way of generalising or defining a singular mixed-race experience or identity; instead, there are a wealth of stories shaped by the cultures we\u2019re formed of and exposed to, our families and friends, where we grew up, who we grew up with, the way we look etc.\n\n\u2018I see that ambiguity as a positive, offering so many unique insights and perspectives and demanding nuance in a world where it is all too often absent.\u2019\n\nMixed Up Being mixed-race is so much more than just black and white (Pictures: Jerry Syder) Mixed Up is our weekly series that gets to the heart of what it means to be mixed-race in the UK today. Going beyond discussions of divided identity, this series takes a look at the unique joys, privileges and complexities that come with being mixed-race - across of variety of different contexts. The mixed-race population is the UK's fastest-growing ethnic group, and yet there is still so much more to understand about the varied lived experiences of individuals within this hugely heterogenous group. Each week we speak to the people who know exactly how it feels to navigate this inbetween space.\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018I have a really unusual mix \u2013 I love that no one can ever guess where I\u2019m from\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Being mixed-race is like being a fly on the wall \u2013 it\u2019s crazy what people feel comfortable saying\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018If white people love hip hop, why the hell can\u2019t we love rock music?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Kristel has Jamaican and European heritage.
