REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/File Photo\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Monday, holding onto 2% gains from Friday amid renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, while a detente in the U.S.-China trade war buoyed market sentiment.\n\nBrent crude futures LCOc1 rose 9 cents to $60.60 a barrel by 1208 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 was at $54.79 a barrel, up 9 cents.\n\nBoth contracts rose more than 3% last week, their first weekly gain in three weeks.\n\nMost of the gains were posted on Friday after an Iranian oil tanker was attacked off Saudi Arabia\u2019s coast in the Red Sea. Investigations are under way to determine if the tanker was hit by missiles, which could ratchet up tensions between Tehran and Riyadh if confirmed.\n\nThe emergence of a phase 1 trade deal between the United States and China and a goodwill move by Washington to suspend threatened tariffs on Chinese products also lifted global financial markets.\n\nInvestors remained cautious given that few details emerged from the talks, while it may take another five weeks for the two countries to sign a pact.\n\n\u201cTraders view the deal in a tentative light as a tariff detente falls well short of bridging the critical trust gap which is an implicit removal of a significant chunk of existing tariff,\u201d said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader in a note.\n\n\u201cThis baby-step agreement could take weeks to iron out.\u201d", "description": "Oil prices were little changed on Monday, holding onto 2% gains from Friday amid renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, while a detente in the U.S.-China trade war buoyed market sentiment.", "authors": ["Florence Tan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440534488&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D00S", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
