In the original series, they just met to share scary stories.\n\nIn the new version, new girl Rachel (Lyliana Wray) joins the Midnight Society, whose members include cool boy-next-door Gavin (Sam Ashe Arnold), straightforward, resourceful Akiko (Miya Cech), germaphobe comic relief Graham (Jeremy Taylor) and loyal Louise (Tamara Smart).\n\nThe cast and producers of Nickelodeon's \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" reboot: Executive producer Matt Kaplan; Jeremy Taylor; Sam Ashe Arnold;, Lyliana Wray; Rafael Casal; Miya Cech; and writer BenDavid Grabinski.

While they wanted to remain faithful to it, they also wanted to test the limits of where they could take this version.\n\nGrabinski felt the original was \"high-octane horror for children\" \u2013 he was definitely a fan \u2013 and he wanted to balance that with attracting a new audience of children unfamiliar with the original show.\n\n\"We often asked ourselves, is this too scary for a 10-year-old?\" Grabinski said in an interview this week at New York Comic Con.\n\n\"There's a lot of scary stuff out there,\" said executive producer Matt Kaplan. \"So, that wasn't going to separate us. I think that if we leaned into the Midnight Society, which is one of the things everyone remembers from the original, I felt like we all were going to (be in) a good position, especially since we found such an amazing cast. . \"\n\nBut '90s Snick fans tuning in for a trip down memory lane will find callbacks and in this version. Even the rebooted intro features the same theme, and images of swings and a hand holding a match.\n\n\"We definitely have some fun characters coming back that are from the original show,\" Kaplan said.\n\nVideo: 'SpongeBob SquarePants' turns 20\n\nA clip from the series shown at New York Comic Con:\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/11/nickelodeon-are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-reboot-midnight-society/3937735002/", "description": "Nickelodeon is submitting for your approval a different take on the cult classic\u00a0\"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" in this limited series reboot.", "authors": ["Felecia Wellington Radel", "Published A.M.
