But in a series of media interviews on Tuesday he would not explain what kind of Brexit plan he would be delivering to Brussels in the coming days, describing it only as \u201cvery good\u201d.\n\nAsked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme if the string of customs checkpoints located five to 10 miles from the border in both Northern Ireland and Ireland was a possibility, Johnson said: \u201cThat is not what we are proposing at all.\u201d\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nHe conceded there would ultimately need to be customs checks in some form, adding: \u201cA sovereign united country must have a single customs territory \u2026 but there are plenty of ways we can facilitate north-south trade, plenty of ways we can address the problem.\u201d\n\nHe said the offer he planned on delivering to the EU was \u201cvery good\u201d and would be revealed soon. It was set to include an \u201call-Ireland\u201d regulation zone.\n\nThe prime minister said: \u201cIf I may say so, the UK government has already made a very considerable offer and if you look at what we\u2019re saying on the sanitary and phytosanitary arrangements \u2013 that is we are already accepting you could have a situation in which, as it were in Northern Ireland, the people are British but the cattle are Irish.\n\n\u201cYou have single territory for agriculture, for sanitary and phytosanitary, for agro-foods and that is a big concession by the UK government.\u201d\n\nShould the UK end up with an extension to Brexit as mandated by the so-called Benn Act, he declined to rule out that Britain could use its veto to scupper legislation in Brussels.\n\nJust days ago he had said EU leaders would not want a \u201ctruculent and mutinous\u201d UK to remain in the bloc and and they may refuse an extension. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the UK may not \u201cplay nice\u201d if it were locked in with the EU for months on end.\n\nJohnson said: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of common observation, the EU wants us to come out. I don\u2019t think any purpose is served by corralling the UK against its will.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe EU wants, quite properly, from their own point of view, to proceed with various measures. They want to move towards a defence union, there\u2019s a great deal of pressure to accelerate various projects that we think are not necessarily in the long-term interests of the UK.\u201d\n\nHe cited a fiscal union to support the euro as one piece of legislation that could have \u201cconsiderable consequences in the UK\u201d, which would not be favourably looked upon.\n\nThe journalist Charlotte Edwardes\u2019 claim that he groped her thigh during a lunch 20 years ago has overshadowed Johnson\u2019s first Conservative party conference as leader, leading to questions about his behaviour towards women in every media interview he has done at the event.\n\nHe told BBC Breakfast said: \u201cI\u2019ve said what I\u2019ve said about that. They are not true. It\u2019s obviously very sad someone should make such allegations.\u201d\n\nAs prime minister, he said the nature of his job meant he expected to \u201ccome under a certain amount of shot and shell\u201d.\n\nHe boasted of how under his tenure as mayor of London, his team had been a \u201cfeminocracy\u201d and in his Radio 4 interview he claimed he was still the same \u201cgenerous-hearted, loving, caring\u201d person he was when he led the capital.\n\n\u201cThat person has not gone away. I am a one nation Tory but we are in a position where the only way we can move this country and unite our country again is get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nThe Benn Act, the legislation that compels Johnson to ask for an extension for Brexit if he is not able to strike a deal with Brussels by 2019, was described as a \u201cconstitutional novelty\u201d by the prime minister.\n\nControversially describing it again as the \u201csurrender act\u201d, he added fuel to the fire to reports that foreign governments may have been involved in its drafting. \u201cWe have no knowledge of how it was produced. It is not subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny. No one knows by whose advice it was drawn up,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked by the Today presenter Nick Robinson about his remarks describing those MPs who worked on the bill as \u201ccollaborators\u201d, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t actually say collaborators. Go back over the quotation, I didn\u2019t say collaborators.\u201d\n\nRobinson interjected: \u201cYou said collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d replied Johnson. \u201cThere are different connotations to different words and nobody knows how these bills are produced and with great respect to all my parliamentary colleagues we do need to work out how to scrutinise these things.\u201d", "description": "Hard border concerns heightened after media reports but PM refuses to explain his \u2018very good\u2019 Brexit plan", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f4dcfd030b653d3c52966c7840b074a08ee2292/0_93_5106_3063/master/5106.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a1ba6490083a022c3d567899d4c81792", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
