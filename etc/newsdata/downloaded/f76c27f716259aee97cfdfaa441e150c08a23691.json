Michael McCaul, Texas Republican, said in an interview on Fox News.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday agreed to a 120-hour halt in a military offensive in northeast Syria to allow the U.S. to help Kurdish fighters leave a 20-mile border buffer zone.\n\nMr. McCaul\u2019s comments came as civilians in the region reported clashes between Turkish and Syrian forces, according to CNN, which took place just hours after the cease-fire was agreed to.\n\nMr. McCaul and committee Chairman Eliot Engel, New York Democrat, announced a sanctions bill Thursday that targets senior Turkish officials and financial institutions and bars the sale of weapons to Turkey to use in Syria.\n\n\u201cI have my concerns on a withdrawal from Syria, particularly as it pertains to protecting the homeland,\u201d Mr. McCaul said.\n\nScores of lawmakers have criticized President Trump\u2019s move to withdraw troops from the region and argue it abandons a key ally, the Kurds, who fought alongside U.S. forces in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cWe certainly hope this works,\u201d Mr. McCaul said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
