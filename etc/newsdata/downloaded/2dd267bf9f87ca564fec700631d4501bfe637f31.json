Some of the increased risk may have also been due to factors not looked at in this study.\n\nHowever, as the results were based on a large, nationally representative sample of participants who were followed for a long period of time, the team concluded that, \"Stable obesity across adulthood, weight gain from young to middle adulthood, and weight loss from middle to late adulthood were associated with increased risks of mortality.\"\n\n\"The results highlight the importance of maintaining normal weight across adulthood, especially preventing weight gain in early adulthood, for preventing premature deaths in later life.\"", "description": "New Chinese research has found that gaining weight at all stages of adulthood could increase the risk of premature death.
