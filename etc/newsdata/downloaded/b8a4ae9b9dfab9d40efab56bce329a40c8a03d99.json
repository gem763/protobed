Knows people sneer that he got lucky in June when his left fist clattered into Anthony Joshua\u2019s temple like a wrecking ball, discombobulating not only his opponent but the millions watching. Knows that many in the trade believe he has got lazy since becoming the first Mexican to win a world heavyweight title. Knows, too, that most expect his Cinderella reign to end as abruptly as Buster Douglas\u2019s did after he shocked Mike Tyson.\n\nBut as Ruiz begins training camp for his WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight rematch against Joshua in Saudi Arabia on 7 December, he insists he is even hungrier now. \u201cI\u2019m still a nice guy,\u201d he says. \u201cI still respect Anthony Joshua. I\u2019m still a fan of what he has done in boxing. But inside the ring, as I\u2019ve told him, there\u2019s no friends, there\u2019s no respect, it\u2019s just me and you, trying to rip each other\u2019s face off. In my eyes, when I\u2019m in the ring I feel he\u2019s there trying to take my kids\u2019 Cheerios, their fruit juice. That\u2019s what gives me the extra motivation.\u201d\n\nAnthony Joshua defiant over criticism of Andy Ruiz Jr rematch in Saudi Arabia Read more\n\nSince becoming heavyweight champion, Ruiz has bought himself a new house, a Rolls Royce and plenty of chunky and expensive jewellery. \u201cBut this is all material stuff,\u201d he insists. \u201cYes, it\u2019s stuff I always wanted. But what I really want is a legacy, not just 15 minutes of fame. The main thing is that I remain humble, stay disciplined, stay training and continue to be champion.\u201d\n\nThe best thing, he insists, about his new life is that he no longer has to \u201cstruggle to pay my bills, the land bills, water bills, electricity, stuff like that\u201d \u2013 although meeting the Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez, after stopping Joshua in the seventh round was also special. \u201cIt meant a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople asked me if I wanted to go and visit the White House but I said I wanted to visit the Mexican White House. It was a beautiful experience.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ruiz will be up against Anthony Joshua for a second time.

The main thing for me is to keep representing Mexico, my people.\u201d\n\nRuiz has watched the replay of his fight with Joshua dozens of times, not just to revel in fresh glories but to analyse his mistakes to become a better fighter for the rematch. \u201cA lot of people have been saying it was a lucky shot,\u201d he says. \u201cAnthony said it was a \u2018shot from the gods\u2019 and I agree \u2013 it was a shot of the gods because I have been praying and wishing for that opportunity for a long time. I was controlling the whole fight. But there were some things I could\u2019ve done a lot better.\u201d\n\nIt helps, too, that Ruiz has tasted Joshua\u2019s best punches and was able to rise, clear-eyed, after being floored in the third. \u201cThat was my first time getting dropped but I got up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really hurt. It should be scary for him to know that. I\u2019m a warrior, I take shots, I give shots back. He\u2019s going to be prepared, I\u2019m going to be prepared. As long as we stay disciplined we\u2019re going to have the same result.\u201d\n\nAndy Ruiz Jr confident history will be repeated in rematch with Joshua Read more\n\nHis trainer, Manny Robles, believes the key moment of the fight came in the sixth when a series of thunderous body shots took the wind out of Joshua. \u201cWhen the round ended I saw Anthony Joshua walk back to his corner and I told Andy: \u2018That\u2019s it. He\u2019s done. He\u2019s done,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019d never been hit to the body the way he got hit to the body with Andy.\u201d\n\nRuiz, meanwhile, vividly remembers the flurry of punches which sent Joshua to the canvas for a final time. \u201cThe funny thing is that in the seventh round all I could hear was my trainer screaming and my dad screaming: \u2018Do it for your kids!\u2019 he says, laughing. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018Shut up! Calm down, I\u2019m doing it for the Cheerios!\u2019\u201d", "description": "Andy Ruiz Jr shocked Anthony Joshua in June, taking his three heavyweight titles, and says there will be \u2018no friends\u2019 and \u2018no respect\u2019 when they meet again in December in Riyadh", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7344019cd3cb041ee688aa4da8502e65622060a/0_199_4350_2611/master/4350.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=200c07860d702a570d72975a0b0d7842", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
