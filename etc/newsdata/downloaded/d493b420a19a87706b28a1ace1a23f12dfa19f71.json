Entering Monday night\u2019s win-or-go-home Game 4, Nationals hitters excluding Rendon and Soto were 12 for 72 in the series\u2019 first three games.\n\nAD\n\nThat includes Turner, the shortstop and leadoff man, who was 3 for 12 before Monday, when the Nationals staved off elimination with a 6-1 victory.\n\nAD\n\nAnd in the sixth inning, representing a crucial insurance run, Turner scored on a Rendon sacrifice fly.\n\nFinally, the Nationals found a rally starter: Turner, who went 3 for 5 with two runs scored Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d Turner said afterward.\n\nHe successfully passed the baton to Manager David Martinez\u2019s thumpers in the third inning, extending a rally for a Rendon sacrifice fly. To lead off the fifth, Turner grooved a line drive into left field for a single and scored on Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s three-run home run. Again the first batter in the sixth, his double led to the final run that gave the Nationals bullpen extra breathing room.\n\nAD\n\nOver that stretch in the middle of the game, Washington gave Los Angeles a taste of its own medicine after the Dodgers rallied in the sixth to take Game 3 on Sunday. The Nationals were able to string together hits that provided the team\u2019s first dose of lasting offense this postseason.\n\nAD\n\nThat inertia at the plate is hard to stop, especially in the playoffs, said right fielder Adam Eaton, who bats behind Turner.\n\n\u201cYou get the momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to calculate why and how, but you just know when it gets going, get on and hang on and enjoy it.\u201d\n\nEaton walked in the third inning to load the bases, and although the Nationals got only one run that inning, their offense was moving. In the fifth, Eaton shoved a sacrifice bunt down the third-base line that moved Turner to second before Rendon knocked him in with a single.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery time [Tuner] is on base, it gives me options to bunt, hit behind runners, whatever it may be,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cAnd having Anthony [Rendon] behind me being my protection, it gives me a lot of fastballs. \u2026 It allows me to have an easier job. I\u2019m blessed where I am. These guys are great athletes and really dynamic players. I haven\u2019t had a chance to play with guys quite like this, so I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTurner said it takes an entire lineup behind him to keep having smart plate appearances and putting the ball in play to string together rallies. The Nationals\u2019 savvy at-bats early on chased Los Angles starter Rich Hill after just 2 \u2154 innings. To that point Hill had allowed two hits, four walks and one run. Then the Nationals touched up the Dodgers bullpen for eight more hits and five more runs.\n\n\u201cI think our lineup is able to compete one through eight and to continue to do that through this postseason has been nice,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me. It\u2019s guys like Eaton slapping the ball around the field and doing all sorts of things, but our lineup in general is a tough one to face.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd for Washington, with its backs against the wall in a potentially decisive game, it was past time for the rest of the offense to contribute in front of Rendon and Soto. Those moments arrived Monday night, and when Rendon drove a line drive deep to center field in the sixth inning and Turner jogged home for Washington\u2019s final run, Nationals fans stood and clapped like that kind of manufactured offense had happened all along.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nRyan Zimmerman blasts Nationals past Dodgers, 6-1, to force Game 5 in L.A.\n\nSvrluga: Max Scherzer is Max Scherzer again, and the Nationals\u2019 season lives because of it\n\nThe Dodgers hoped to avoid a Game 5 in L.A., but they\u2019re familiar with the pressure\n\nAlex Ovechkin throwing the first pitch before Game 4 deepens the Capitals-Nationals connection\n\nMax Scherzer explains the pressure athletes are under at all times\n\nAD", "description": "Turner busted loose on Monday, going 3 for 5 with two runs scored and a double in the Game 4 win.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hO-MlQiqwVqvGAMfp2IQkYrbyOI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZQJCNDXJOQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
