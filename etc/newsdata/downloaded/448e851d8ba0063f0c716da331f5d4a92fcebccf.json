Ultimately, hiring people for their values is the most critical aspect in this increasingly dynamic and disrupted world.\n\nWhat excites you right now?\n\nDe Ferrari likes to return with his family to Tuscany. Shutterstock\n\nIn terms of business, it's how technology is changing the game in so many places \u2013 solving problems, improving services, shaping client expectations and challenging businesses, governments and regulators to keep up.\n\nAt AMP we have a unique opportunity to reinvent our company and build a truly client-led financial services business that thinks and acts like a start-up.\n\nWhat office habits annoy you?\n\nWhen people fall into the trap of only seeing the negative \u2013 I\u2019m a glass half-full person. It\u2019s good to see the risks, but don\u2019t be defeated by them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is your morning ritual/exercise regimen?\n\nHaving breakfast with my wife and kids is the best way to start the day. And I really enjoy the ferry ride to work, something quite unique to the magic of Sydney.\n\nFavourite holiday spot?\n\nI love adventure and exploring different places all the time and can\u2019t wait to travel to all the wonderful locations in Australia. The only constant destination for our family has been a small seaside resort in Tuscany \u2013 even an itinerate family like ours needs to keep roots.\n\nLast good book, podcast or film?\n\nBuilt to Last, by Jim Collins\n\nHow do you unwind?\n\nSpending time with my family. There\u2019s nothing like helping my kids with homework to take my mind off work.\n\nWhen do your best ideas come?\n\nI am an extrovert and so enjoy problem solving in discussions with others. I generally find the best inspiration from entrepreneurs in very different businesses to ours or from my children. The next generation thinks and behaves very differently and we\u2019ll need to adapt to the clients of tomorrow.\n\nRead the full interview with Francesco De Ferrari in AFR BOSS magazine on Friday.", "description": "The AMP chief executive describes himself as a glass-half-full sort of person, so negativity at work is a no-no.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3243%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_127%2C$y_370/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/52d09cf0b18b8d0b886893874b6c68764db9ce6b", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
