They also said they had to restrict access to the visitor logbook after Republicans staffers leaked names of individuals signing in for job interviews when the majority was hiring this year.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi are hell-bent on conducting their impeachment inquiry behind closed doors. Taxpayers deserve transparency throughout the impeachment process,\" a congressional official who is working on the impeachment inquiry told Townhall. \"It\u2019s only fair that President Trump and the American people get to face the President\u2019s accuser.\"\n\nTrump has said he deserves to meet with his accuser, who filed a report saying the president pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange to providing military aid.\n\n\"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called 'Whistleblower,' represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,\" Trump tweeted, adding, \"His lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber.\"\n\nLike every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u201cWhistleblower,\u201d represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress...... \u2014 Donald J.
