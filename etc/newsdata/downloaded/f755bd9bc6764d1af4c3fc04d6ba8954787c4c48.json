I\u2019m sorry about your brother, but this is probably the cruelest, most unhealthy way to address the situation with the children,\u201d another added.\n\n\u201cYou need to put a stop to this now. Don\u2019t f**k them up further,\u201d a man said.\n\nMental health: How to talk about it with someone who needs help 62784 R U OK? Day is for starting conversations about mental health, but what do you do if someone says \"No\"? Here are some tips to help you have those difficult conversations about depression or suicide.\n\n\"Shut this down immediately\"\n\nMany commenters were baffled that John had allowed the charade to go on as long as it has.\n\nThey were confused why he didn't put a stop to the kids calling him dad straight away.\n\n\u201cI'm not trying to be a dick, and I feel truly sorry for you, but I'm just trying to figure out how this has escalated so far,\u201d one man said.\n\n\u201cThe whole situation is beyond weird but it does sound like this is how your SIL is 'coping' with the loss,\u201d another added.\n\n\u201cTell them TODAY that you\u2019re not their father, that he died, and that it\u2019s OK to be sad that they won\u2019t see him anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stop going over to help, you stop going round to babysit, you speak to her about it and you shut down the \u2018they call me daddy\u2019 s**t immediately,\u201d a woman said.\n\n\"I knew what happened even if it felt like dream\"\n\nBut the most powerful comment came from a man who lost his dad when he was a kid.\n\nThe man said that his mum and other adults in his life were extremely upfront about the fact his dad was gone.\n\nHe remembered attending the funeral even though as a young child he didn\u2019t completely grasp what was going on.\n\n\u201cBut I knew what happened even if it felt like dream,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't his death or death in general that made a grandiose impact later it was grownups and their drama, their emotions and behaviour about it that influenced and shaped mine after a while.\n\n\u201cSo people, don't shelter kids from death - they understand more than we think. And they deal with this better than grownups.\u201d\n\n*Name has been changed", "description": "\"My sister-in-law is going along with it - she refuses to tell her girls the truth.\"", "authors": ["Madeline Cox"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/e1225ae5abb0a668ba1c5bc4bfcd5bce", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
