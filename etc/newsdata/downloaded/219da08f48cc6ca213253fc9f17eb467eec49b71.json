Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nWELCOME BACK. The House and Senate come back into session today after six weeks of \u201cdistrict work.\u201d There are 21 DAYS until the government shuts down. Fewer than four months until the end of 2019 -- which means there are fewer than four months until a presidential election year. Not much time to get anything done. So we spoke to our sources in the congressional leadership to lay out the dynamics each leader faces this fall and beyond.\n\n-- SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: The obvious big question facing Pelosi is simple: How does she handle what\u2019s quickly turning into a process that could lead to impeaching President DONALD TRUMP? More than half of the Democratic Caucus wants to begin proceedings to remove the president. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler of New York, seems ready to scream from the rooftops that he\u2019s ready to dump Trump -- and his colleagues sense it. Just Friday, POLITICO scooped that Nadler\u2019s committee would vote to define the impeachment probe -- meaning it\u2019s getting more and more serious. And it falls to the Democratic leadership to hold this process together.\n\nPELOSI, generally speaking, is as attuned to her own internal dynamics as anyone in the Capitol, and if she has to move, she will move. But, last we checked -- and knowing Pelosi\u2019s private remarks -- she still does not believe the public is ready for impeachment. Conventional wisdom would dictate that time is running short for impeachment, and Pelosi couldn\u2019t move to impeach the president during an election year. Although these days, conventional wisdom is as useful as it sounds.\n\nOF COURSE PELOSI has other priorities: a fair shake when it comes to the spending bills that will come due at the end of September and a tightening of gun laws, to name two. The USMCA -- the replacement for NAFTA -- will be on everyone\u2019s agenda, but Democrats close to Pelosi believe consideration of the agreement might be delayed until 2020. The National Defense Authorization Act -- which sets military policy each year -- could be a minefield, considering Trump\u2019s gutting of military projects to build the wall he has never been able to convince Congress to fund. There\u2019s also the reality that, come January, Democrats will be smack dab back in the middle of an election year, with the top of the ticket beginning to come into focus.\n\n-- SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL: This is the figure who has, perhaps, the most interesting matrix of considerations at play. McConnell has a Senate map that\u2019s tricky -- although he\u2019ll remind you not to focus on the map, and that each race has to be won individually -- and a president whose legislative positions are as easy to pin down as Jell-O. If you talk to people in McConnell\u2019s orbit, you\u2019d know the following: He doesn\u2019t want another shutdown, and he'd like to finish the government spending negotiations without drama. He has a few things on his plate: more judicial nominations, government funding and the NDAA.\n\nON GUNS, McConnell has been stunningly consistent: He is not going to move unless the president gives him something to move on. McConnell isn\u2019t foreclosing the possibility of gun legislation, but notes he\u2019s going to take the president\u2019s lead. He isn\u2019t about to put his lawmakers through a ton of tough votes unless the president is ready to sign something.\n\nPOLITICALLY, McConnell\u2019s Senate Republicans have some tough races on their hands: Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Martha McSally in Arizona and David Perdue and the open seat in Georgia. McConnell has had a field day trying to tie all Senate Democrats to some of the most progressive voices in the House. Of course, McConnell has his own race in 2020. And Democratic money is going to pour in to try to beat him.\n\n-- SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER. Scumer\u2019s biggest challenge -- if it\u2019s a challenge -- is not letting any daylight come between him and Pelosi. The White House has tried to split the two Democratic leaders, but with little success.\n\nGUN CONTROL will continue to be one of Schumer\u2019s top priorities. Take this letter, and accompanying New York Times story: Pelosi and Schumer are pressing Trump to urge the Senate to take up a House-passed background bill. It won\u2019t happen, of course, since Senate Republicans have said the House\u2019s bill goes too far. But it\u2019s a headline, and helps highlight what Schumer and Democrats see as Republican inaction. The letter also invokes the NRA, which helps Democrats highlight their view that the GOP is a wholly owned subsidiary of the gun lobby.\n\n-- HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY. House Republicans have a few priorities. They have to fight to project Trump from impeachment and more investigations. They have to stick together to maintain any leverage they have against Democrats legislatively. And they have to focus maniacally on the handful of Democrats who hold seats that Trump won in 2016. McCarthy believes he is uniquely suited for this moment, because he has the political game needed to win back the majority.\n\nTHE LOOK-AHEADS \u2026 AP \u2026 WaPo\n\nGood Monday morning.\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK \u2026 REMEMBER VALERIE PLAME? \u2026 The former CIA operative is running for Congress in New Mexico, and has a splashy introduction video that ties in her being outed by Scooter Libby, Trump\u2019s pardoning of Dick Cheney\u2019s former chief of staff and her run for Congress.

The C-17 crew\u2019s overnight stay at Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort in Scotland earlier this year, first reported by POLITICO on Friday, was not an isolated incident.\u201d POLITICO\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES \u2026 A1, NYT: \u201cHow Trump\u2019s Plan to Secretly Meet With the Taliban Came Together, and Fell Apart,\u201d by Peter Baker, Mujib Mashal and Michael Crowley: \u201cOn the Friday before Labor Day, President Trump gathered top advisers in the Situation Room to consider what could be among the profound decisions of his presidency \u2014 a peace plan with the Taliban after 18 years of grinding, bloody war in Afghanistan. \u2026\n\n\u201cAs they discussed terms of the agreement, [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo and his negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, made the case that it would enable Mr. Trump to begin withdrawing troops while securing a commitment from the Taliban not to shelter terrorists. [John] Bolton, beaming in by video from Warsaw, where he was visiting, argued that Mr. Trump could keep his campaign pledge to draw down forces without getting in bed with killers swathed in American blood.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump made no decision on the spot, but at some point during the meeting the idea was floated to finalize the negotiations in Washington, a prospect that appealed to the president\u2019s penchant for dramatic spectacle. Mr. Trump suggested that he would even invite President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, whose government has not been party to the talks, and get him to sign on.\n\n\u201cIn the days that followed, Mr. Trump came up with an even more remarkable idea \u2014 he would not only bring the Taliban to Washington, but to Camp David, the crown jewel of the American presidency. \u2026 Thus began an extraordinary few days of ad hoc diplomatic wrangling that upended the talks in a weekend Twitter storm. On display were all of the characteristic traits of the Trump presidency \u2014 the yearning ambition for the grand prize, the endless quest to achieve what no other president has achieved, the willingness to defy convention, the volatile mood swings and the tribal infighting.\u201d NYT\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The comments by Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, on Saturday were instantly scrutinized for clues as to whether the president\u2019s children, some of whom have been seen by friends and supporters as potential candidates for office, were planning their own political futures.\n\n\u201cMr. Parscale made the remarks at a California Republican convention in Indian Wells, in a speech that touched on the party and the presidency. \u2018The Trumps will be a dynasty that lasts for decades,\u2019 Mr. Parscale said. Asked to explain what that meant, he told reporters in California that he views the Trump family as people with \u2018amazing capabilities.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I think you see that from Don Jr. I think you see that from Ivanka. You see it from Jared. You see it from all,\u2019 he said, referring to the president\u2019s eldest son, eldest daughter and son-in-law.\u201d NYT\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026 \u201cInternal Kamala Harris document acknowledges \u2018Summer Slump,\u2019\u201d by Trent Spiner in Manchester, N.H.: \u201cA briefing memo accidentally left behind at a restaurant here showed Kamala Harris\u2019 staff expected her to be grilled on her lack of presence in the state as well as her campaign\u2019s \u2018summer slump.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe document, obtained exclusively by POLITICO, detailed intricacies of her campaign\u2019s relationships with Granite Staters she was set to meet last weekend \u2014 from how much her campaign has donated to local politicians to advice she received from a local TV reporter.\n\n\u201cIt included talking points to rebut expected criticisms from voters or reporters, such as the limited number of visits she\u2019s made to the first-in-the-nation primary state and her lackluster poll results. \u2018You haven\u2019t traveled to New Hampshire as frequently as some of your Democratic rivals,\u2019 the memo, titled \u2018Briefing and Talking Points,\u2019 said. \u2018Is the state a priority for your campaign?\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- DAVID SIDERS and ELENA SCHNEIDER: \u201c\u2018Nervous as hell\u2019: Joe Biden is the front-runner everyone keeps waiting to implode\u201d: \u201cHe continues to outdistance the rest of the Democratic primary field in most polls. And his head-to-head numbers against President Donald Trump are stronger than anyone else\u2019s.\n\n\u201cNo one should be surprised next year if Joe Biden becomes the nominee. What is surprising is how many people expect his campaign to implode any day.\n\n\u201cIt is a sensation underpinning the entire primary, evident not only in the vulturous calculations of Biden\u2019s competitors, but also within his own orbit of supporters \u2014 a feeling that the frontrunner may be made of porcelain, one direct hit short of falling apart. \u2018There\u2019s a clear worry among Biden supporters that he can\u2019t be the front-runner from June of 2019 through July of 2020 \u2026 that eventually the gaffes will pile up and he\u2019ll come down,\u2019 said Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and one of Biden\u2019s most vocal supporters.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from Business Roundtable: USMCA should be a top priority for Members of Congress to support the millions of Americans who depend on trade with Canada and Mexico.

Trump will visit the state Monday night on the eve of the House election. He enjoys wide popularity within his own party, but a GOP defeat in a red-leaning state could, when combined with a wave of recent bad headlines, portend trouble for his reelection campaign.\u201d AP\n\n-- STEVEN SHEPARD in Weddington, N.C.: \u201cThe last, lingering piece of the 2018 election is about to preview the fundamental dynamic shaping the fight for the White House in 2020.\n\n\u201cTuesday\u2019s do-over election for a congressional seat marred by allegations of fraud last year, taking place in a Republican-leaning slice of North Carolina, exemplifies the key push-pull of politics in the Trump era: Cities and suburbs racing away from the GOP and toward Democrats \u2014 and rural and exurban voters roaring back in the other direction, propelled by President Donald Trump\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cThe battle to maximize those trends will shape the 2020 campaign between Trump and his Democratic opponent in virtually every important swing state, from the Midwestern battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to Florida and Arizona in the Sun Belt. And it\u2019s driving the election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th District, which Trump carried handily in 2016 but became a surprising 2018 swing seat amid broad suburban backlash to the president.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTRUMP\u2019S MONDAY -- The president will present the Medal of Valor and Heroic Commendations in the East Room at 11 a.m. He will leave the White House at 2:15 p.m. en route to Fayetteville, N.C.

Over the past year, Falwell, a prominent evangelical leader and supporter of President Donald Trump, has come under increasing scrutiny. News outlets have reported on business deals by Liberty University benefiting Falwell\u2019s friends. Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen claimed that he had helped Falwell clean up racy \u2018personal\u2019 photographs.\n\n\u201cBased on scores of new interviews and documents obtained for this article, concerns about Falwell\u2019s behavior go well beyond that\u2014and it\u2019s causing longtime, loyal Liberty University officials to rapidly lose faith in him.\n\n\u201cMore than two dozen current and former high-ranking Liberty University officials and close associates of Falwell spoke to me or provided documents for this article, opening up\u2014for the first time at an institution so intimately associated with the Falwell family\u2014about what they\u2019ve experienced and why they don\u2019t think he\u2019s the right man to lead Liberty University or serve as a figurehead in the Christian conservative movement.\n\n\u201cIn interviews over the past eight months, they depicted how Falwell and his wife, Becki, consolidated power at Liberty University and how Falwell presides over a culture of self-dealing, directing university resources into projects and real estate deals in which his friends and family have stood to make personal financial gains. Among the previously unreported revelations are Falwell\u2019s decision to hire his son Trey\u2019s company to manage a shopping center owned by the university, Falwell\u2019s advocacy for loans given by the university to his friends, and Falwell\u2019s awarding university contracts to businesses owned by his friends.\u201d POLITICO Magazine\n\nSCOOP -- \u201cIAEA found uranium traces at Iran \u2018atomic warehouse,\u2019\u201d by Reuters\u2019 Francois Murphy in Vienna: \u201cSamples taken by the U.N. nuclear watchdog at what Israel\u2019s prime minister called a \u2018secret atomic warehouse\u2019 in Tehran showed traces of uranium that Iran has yet to explain, two diplomats who follow the agency\u2019s inspections work closely say.\n\n\u201cThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is investigating the particles\u2019 origin and has asked Iran to explain the traces.

A less appreciated reason for lower rates is a mountain of debt built up during the past decade.\n\n\u201cDebt owed by governments, businesses and households around the globe is up nearly 50% since before the financial crisis to $246.6 trillion at the beginning of March, according to the Institute of International Finance, an association of global financial firms.\n\n\u201cThe borrowing helped pull economies out of the nasty recession, but left them with high debt burdens that make it harder for policy makers to raise rates.

But Democrats are fighting Democrats over whether to focus on social justice issues or industry priorities like banking. Marijuana advocates are divided among themselves over whether to push for full legalization or settle for less far-reaching legislation. And many Republicans \u2014 some of whom are seeing the benefits of cannabis legalization in their home states \u2014 are still decidedly against any legalization on the national level, even for medicinal uses.\n\n\u201cAt the same time that Congress is in gridlock, there is growing national support for cannabis, which is illegal at the federal level but at least partially legal in 33 states. In addition, public opinion is shifting rapidly, with nearly two-thirds of Americans supporting legalization according to Gallup \u2014 double the level of support two decades ago.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s led to a steadily growing number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who represent states with legal cannabis markets, making them more sympathetic toward legislation aimed at helping the burgeoning industry \u2014 which brought in roughly $10 billion in sales last year.\u201d POLITICO\n\nBUSING IS BACK \u2026 PLAYBOOK METRO SECTION: \u201cIn Howard County, a \u2018courageous\u2019 plan to redraw school boundaries tests community\u2019s commitment to diversity\u201d: \u201cIn Howard County, people pride themselves on making everyone feel welcome.
