Just think of the rivalry. Luckily, the sons of roadside spruiking legend David Nettlefold know how to play nice.\n\nBarclay Nettlefold when he was Swimming Australia president. Joe Armao\n\nLast month, ex-St Kilda footballer and CEO Michael Nettlefold's Nettlefold Media entered into a 10-year deal with airport business park Essendon Fields to manage its Tullamarine Freeway-facing outdoor advertising assets, dislodging incumbent oOh!media in the process.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, listed outdoor media company QMS Media announced it had been appointed to manage the sales and marketing activities of the same outdoor marketing portfolio from November 1.\n\nThe appointment came via NM Media, QMS' announcement points out. Which is a fully-owned subsidiary of Nettlefold.\n\nAs QMS would be well aware. Its group CEO is ex-Swimming Australia president Barclay Nettlefold, Michael's younger brother. Who as well as heading up QMS, also owns 14.1 per cent of it, according to the last annual report.\n\nOf course, there's nothing preventing QMS doing business with a company owned by its CEO's brother. \"The standard sales representation agreement\" between QMS and NM Media, a spokesperson for QMS said, is \"on standard arm's length commercial terms\". Though it's certainly been noted in the industry.\n\nEssendon Fields itself could be described as a family affair. A privately-held partnership between developer Max Beck and the family of trucking magnate Lindsay Fox (his son Andrew is a director), it houses a quarter of the nation's corporate jets.", "description": "The sons of roadside spruiking legend David Nettlefold know how to play nice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_46/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/458c7ddbd0574ad354a3d1a02a6d33b7faeacd40", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
