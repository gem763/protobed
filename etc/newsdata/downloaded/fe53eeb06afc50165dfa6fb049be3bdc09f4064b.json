He said three factors \u2014 cost, location and supply \u2014 have kept the black market booming.\n\n\"[In] Ontario, we had no stores for six months. Now we've got 25 and we're still waiting for the next 50. That means the legal industry is missing an opportunity to sell product and take a bigger bite out of the black market,\" he said\n\nUsing crowdsourced data, Statistics Canada reported that a gram of cannabis purchased from government-approved retailers cost $10.23 in the third quarter.\n\nDuring that same period, the price for a gram of marijuana from an illegal source was about $5.59.\n\nStatistics Canada has urged caution when interpreting its cannabis numbers, since the data are self-submitted.\n\nUntil the legal industry matures, the black market will flourish, said Toronto lawyer Daniel Brown.\n\n\"People find that the black market is servicing them a lot better than the legal marijuana stores,\" said Brown, vice-president of the Criminal Lawyers Association.\n\n\"You can still on the black market buy a larger variety of marijuana for much cheaper.\"\n\n'More or less uneventful'\n\nWhile the black market persists, Serr said other worries about legalization \u2014 such as fears of a spike in impaired driving stats \u2014 have turned out to be overblown.\n\n\"Overall, I think we can say it was more or less uneventful,\" he said. \"The sky didn't fall, as some may have predicted.\"\n\nStatistics Canada doesn't provide a breakdown of marijuana-related driving offences, making it hard to describe the impact of cannabis legalization on drug-impaired driving.\n\nKyla Lee, founder of the Canadian Impaired Driving Lawyers Association, has been monitoring the impaired driving caseload and said there hasn't been a marked increase in cannabis-impaired driving since legalization.\n\nUnder the new impaired driving law, police can demand a breathalyzer test from any driver pulled over for violating traffic laws or at a check stop.\n\n\"When this legislation was introduced, and as we were approaching legalization, I was really critical ... of what the police might do with the new powers that were given to them,\" she said, adding police have been using those expanded powers \"in a very appropriate way.\"\n\n\"I don't see any systemic overuse of their authority when it comes to impaired driving investigations,\" she added. \"And that gives me a lot of comfort as a defence lawyer and as a citizen.\"", "description": "When the Liberal government rolled out its plans to legalize recreational marijuana, it promised to shrink the black market and keep money out of the hands of organized crime.
