Parliament was expected to vote on the deal Saturday, but instead passed a last-minute motion to postpone an important Brexit vote, legally forcing Johnson to request a delay on the U.K.\u2019s exit. The outcome injects new confusion and uncertainty into the Brexit process and piles pressure on Britain's leader just three months into his tenure. His government argued that any delay increases the likelihood of a \"no deal\" Brexit, which experts warn could harm Britain\u2019s economy and lead to border chaos.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrives for a media conference at an EU summit in Brussels, on Oct. 17, 2019.

Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, led by his top rival, Andrew Scheer, are in a neck-and-neck race, recent polls show.While Trudeau\u2019s government has passed some popular legislation such as the legalization of cannabis, the administration has been plagued by several controversies and scandals. Several photos of Trudeau wearing blackface when he was younger surfaced in September, but political analyst P.J. Fournier, who runs the poll tracking website 338Canada, said the scandal had little effect on public opinion. Should the Conservatives win more parliamentary seats, Fournier pointed out there is still a chance Trudeau could stay in power by forming a coalition with the New Democratic Party.\n\nJustin Trudeau apologizes again, blames 'privilege' as third blackface instance emerges\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologizes again for 'brownface' at campaign event (Photo: AP)\n\nSweeping opioid trial scheduled to begin after settlement rejection\n\nThe first federal trial related to the nation's opioid epidemic is scheduled to start Monday in Cleveland after settlement talks failed. Two Ohio counties claim that six drug companies that made prescription painkillers engaged in a deadly conspiracy that has harmed their communities and generated huge public costs. An offer of $48 billion in cash, treatment drugs and services was rejected as lawyers for the 2,400 cities and counties involved clashed with states attorneys general over the distribution of the settlement. The trial has been considered a test case for similar lawsuits from governments across the country and possibly the linchpin for a settlement of the more than 2,300 suits filed against drug companies.\n\nOpioids in Alaska: Nurse, doctor faces charges for giving out millions of doses\n\nDon't miss the Orionid meteor shower late Monday\n\nKeep your eyes to the night sky late Monday night and especially early Tuesday morning \u2013 you might get a peek at the Orionid meteor shower. The Orionids are some of the fastest and brightest among meteor showers because the Earth is hitting the stream of particles almost head-on. How fast? Most zip by at 41 miles per second, which translates to about 148,000 mph. The best time to view the shower is after midnight, when the constellation Orion rises high above the horizon. Try to avoid light pollution and don't use binoculars or telescopes. If you miss this shower, you can still catch the Leonids in November and the Geminds in December.\n\nNOTE As of Oct. 17; SOURCE AccuWeather (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\n'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' finishes off 'Joker's run at No. 1 \u2013 but not by much\n\nDisney's \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" has knocked \"Joker\" out of the No. 1 spot at the box office, but just barely, with final numbers expected Monday.
