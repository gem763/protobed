The legislation gives her government virtually unlimited powers to do anything it considers necessary for public order.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman stands in front of a closed entrance gate to the Causeway Bay MRT train station.

The movement has five demands now, including an independent inquiry into police brutality and more democracy for the city.\n\nProtesters called a day of rest on Saturday, before a large march against the ban on Sunday, but the city was still on edge. The entire MTR metro network, with typically more than 4m trips a day, was shuttered apart from the airport express.\n\nMany shops and supermarkets closed early, and even the 7-Eleven convenience stores that are a staple of city life and usually open around the clock, said they would shut in the afternoon. Queues formed at ATMs in the morning, and food shops that were still open were busier than normal.\n\nIn the afternoon a small, peaceful crowd marched across Hong Kong island, but there were no major demonstrations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A customer leaves as an employee pulls down the shutters at a convenience store normally open 24 hours a day in Hong Kong.

Flanked by all her ministers, who stood silent as Lam spoke, she called on the city\u2019s 7.5 million citizens to back her.\n\n\u201cThe extreme violence clearly illustrated that Hong Kong\u2019s public safety is widely endangered,\u201d Lam said, in her first comments since Friday\u2019s ban.\n\nCrowds had taken to the streets soon after she announced the ban, effective overnight. Face masks have become a staple at protests, partly because of heavy teargas use and partly because people fear arrest or retaliation if they are identified.\n\nProtesters set fire to two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses considered pro-China; police responded with teargas, and a 14-year-old student was shot in the thigh with a live round. He was taken to hospital in a serious condition.\n\nOn Saturday, police sent text messages urging the public to avoid protests over the three-day weekend. But despite the transport difficulties, and the fact that Sunday\u2019s protest had not got a police permit, large numbers were expected to turn out.\n\nViolence grips Hong Kong as Lam activates emergency powers Read more\n\nSecondary school students also launched a petition, calling on police not to punish or report them for wearing a mask.\n\nThe Chinese ambassador to the UK said Beijing would not hesitate to intervene if it thought it was necessary. Despite the worst outbreak of violence yet over the last week, and the shooting of two teenage students with live ammunition, he claimed the situation had improved and denied Lam had lost control.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carrie Lam (C) stands with her cabinet as she delivers a video message released to media organisations in Hong Kong.

He added: \u201c(At present) the situation is still under control and we have full trust in the Hong Kong government and the chief executive.\u201d", "description": "Carrie Lam\u2019s ban on face masks provokes wave of fear and fury ahead of march on Sunday", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df2533b9e45d035c7b61165825cc7007fc5b878c/0_187_5898_3538/master/5898.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af739ab33d8b80a3cdc689721b39605d", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
