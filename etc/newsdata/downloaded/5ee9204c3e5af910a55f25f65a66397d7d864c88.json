Trump hasn't named anyone to the job yet - the acting deputy is David Pekoske, the head of the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nFILE - In this Sept. 20, 2019, file photo, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Washington.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nMcAleenan, a longtime U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, was seen as a level head who could effectively manage the border crisis, but like many other former administration officials who came before, Trump eventually soured on him.\n\nHis tenure was marked by internal squabbling and jockeying by others in the department vying for top jobs, all playing out against a backdrop of outrage and horror amid reports of children being held in squalid conditions and images of those who perished trying to make the trek.\n\nThe 240,000-person department is tasked with election security and cybersecurity, disaster response and even the Secret Service. But for Trump, the Department of Homeland Security means one thing: immigration. The president's signature issue makes the department his focus and his ire. Balancing a White House eager to push major changes with the reality on the ground is a constant challenge.\n\nMcAleenan, who has years of experience with border issues, was seen initially in Trump's circle as someone who could get control over the crisis, despite his stance as a moderate who pushed for aid to be restored to Central American nations.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump said Friday that Kevin McAleenan was stepping down as the acting secretary of Homeland Security.Trump said McAleenan...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/01/wire-19613248-1570840081-476_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
