It will document their daily life and the ups and downs of being Australian music royalty.\n\n\u201cWe grew up with MTV and to be able to create a show together, bringing people closer inside our lives of music and as sisters, is going to be a wild ride,\u201d Jess and Lisa said in a statement.\n\nBasically, we can expect an inside look at their Brisbane-based lives, which honestly don\u2019t seem that dramatic. But hopefully we\u2019ll get to see their side of the whole Qantas flight saga that took place yesterday.\n\n\u201cThe Veronicas were part of our first-ever MTV Push launch in 2009, and we are so excited to work with them again and give fans a new, behind-the-scenes look into their lives and music in a way only MTV can do,\u201d Viacom global head of music and talent Bruce Gillmer said.\n\nThe show will be shot and produced in Australia, and will depict their day to day lives in the lead up to the release of their next album, due out in early 2020 (mark your calendars).\n\nSince their debut album The Secret Life Of\u2026 went quadruple platinum back in 2005, The Veronicas have remained an iconic part of Australian pop music.\n\nMore recently, their 2007 track Untouched went viral on Twitter for reasons I don\u2019t quite understand, and thus, The Veronicas resurgence began.\n\nThey\u2019re about to play Good Things festival, and are apparently working on a fourth studio album that\u2019s set to be filled with more certified bangers.\n\n\u201cThe Wall of death at Good Things has nothing on a day in the life of Jess and Lisa, let\u2019s just put it that way,\u201d Lisa told Music Feeds when discussing the upcoming show.\n\nJess & Lisa: The Veronicas is set to premiere on Foxtel in November 2019.", "description": "Australian pop icons The Veronicas are set to release their own reality TV show in partnership with MTV debuting in November 2019.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1158296373.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
