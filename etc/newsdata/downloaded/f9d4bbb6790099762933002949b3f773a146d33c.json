(Which as a quick sidebar would make these fields ripe for artificial intelligence picking, yes? That is, if in-person visits aren\u2019t necessary to determine mental fitness, well then, a computer would seem a cost-efficient alternative. Say bye-bye to the whole psychology profession).\n\nAnyway: It\u2019s ridiculous when psychiatric professionals try to diagnose the president long-distance.\n\nIt\u2019s just as ridiculous for pastors to do the same to their Trump supporters in the congregation, and any Trump supporters who happen by the sign.\n\nWorse, perhaps, is the sign\u2019s other side.\n\nIt reads: \u201cA white vote for Trump is pure racism.\u201d\n\nGood Lord, pastor.\n\n\u201cGod motivates me to take a stand for what\u2019s right,\u201d pastor Michael Jordan told a local news station, The Hill reported. \u201cRead the Bible and look in the White House. If they call me a racist, look in the White House. When you vote for Donald Trump, you are supporting institutionalized racism.\u201d\n\nOK.\n\nBut all Caucasians who vote for Trump are racist? All blacks who vote for Trump are mentally ill?\n\nThat seems a bit over the top. Particularly for a pastor. And here\u2019s one other quick point to mull: If this were Barack Obama\u2019s White House, the IRS would have been sicced his way.\n\nPastor Jordan, under a different administration, under the previous administration, would have faced the stripping of his church\u2019s nonprofit status just for making those political comments.\n\nWhere\u2019s the mental illness accusation about that?\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
