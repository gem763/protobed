And there\u2019s more choice than ever.\n\nWe tried and tested a range of multi-cookers using the suggested recipes and programmes \u2013 from machines that cost no more than twenty quid up to those that will set you back over a grand.\n\nWe took into consideration number of programmes, ease of use, extra functions such as timer and keep warm, and of course the culinary results.\n\nWe also marked them on how easy the cookers were to keep clean and store away.\n\nInterestingly, it wasn\u2019t always the top dollar machines that came out best \u2013 in fact, some didn\u2019t even make it into our roundup at all. Read on to find out which ones did, and why.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

As it sounds, it gives a crispier finish to the pressure cooking \u2013 great for the likes of roast chicken. In addition, this versatile machine can slow cook, steam, bake, grill, sear and saut\u00e9, with recipes for each. Plus, it can air fry, adding a healthy dimension. We found it easy to use and the accessories dishwasher friendly. But it\u2019s a large machine with a lot of added extras, including two different lids \u2013 not a friend to smaller kitchens, then. And you might want to change some of the suggested cooking times \u2013 adding on time for crispier foods and reducing for steaming, for example. All in all, though, this is a fabulous all-rounder that caters to most culinary needs.\n\nBuy now\n\nMorphy Richards MyPot Pressure Cooker: \u00a359.99, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThis looks far more futuristic than the traditional pressure cooker, its modern look is also reflected in its impressive capabilities. Its a powerful machine, with 10 pre-set functions that cover everything \u2013 from pasta to puddings, and soups to stews. There\u2019s also a manual mode if you prefer more control over your cooking. Features such as the keep-warm function and delay timer are a godsend if you\u2019re busy, the range of recipes it comes with are decent too. It doesn\u2019t take up much room on the kitchen counter, and feels of high quality. Our only complaint was the it lacks a handle on the inner pot, so you\u2019ll need your oven gloves at the ready.\n\nBuy now\n\nDrew & Cole CleverChef mulit-cooker: \u00a369.99, Amazon\n\nWith 14 pre-set cooking functions \u2013 including steam, stew, soup, roast, poach, bread rise, bake, fish, saute, brown, rice, pasta, slow cook high, slow cook low and yoghurt settings \u2013 this one-pot machine will keep you busy. Features are well thought out including keep warm, delay timer and DIY to adapt the recipes. The shiny black exterior keep it looking smart and everything from rice to chocolate cake turned out well for us, with this machine proving a massive time saver and a bargain for well under a hundred quid. But the instructions could be more comprehensive.\n\nBuy now\n\nCrock-Pot Express Multi Cooker CSC051: \u00a375, Amazon\n\nMention Crock-Pot and most people think of slow cookers. In America, the brand name is as synonymous to them as hoovers are to vacuum cleaners here. Now they\u2019ve come up with this machine that pressure cooks, slow cooks, saut\u00e9s and steams. Unsurprisingly, the slow cooker is top-notch. We were impressed with how well it browned meat and steamed rice \u2013 it doesn\u2019t cook food quite as well as top-quality pressure cookers, but it does the job. It works fast, cooking a whole chicken in half an hour, although you can only delay the cooking for up to four hours. It\u2019s not the easiest to clean, though.\n\nBuy now\n\nTefal multicook advanced 45-in-1 cooker: \u00a394, Amazon\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think up 45 cooking programmes, let alone fit them all in one machine. But that\u2019s what the guys at Tefal have done, enabling you to cook everything from risottos to roast chicken and from porridge to pasta. It has enough capacity to feed a whopping 20 people and the reheat, delay start and keep warm functions are useful in busy households. But it has no stirring attachments, it\u2019s huge and you\u2019ll need to give yourself time to get to grips with it if you prefer adapting recipes as there is some potential for kitchen tantrums along the way when things don\u2019t quite go to plan. Not so with stews and rice dishes, though \u2013 we really rated those.\n\nBuy now\n\nLakeland Mini Multi Cooker 1.8L: \u00a349.99, Lakeland\n\nThis is ideal for one or two person households. Despite its small size, it is capable of great things \u2013 including soups, curries, yoghurt, cakes and particularly good rice. We found it easy to set up and use, thanks to the LED control panel and useful features such as a countdown timer and keep-warm function. It beeps when your food is ready and the removable cooking pot has a carry handle, so you can pop it straight on the table \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to clean afterwards. Only shame is there\u2019s no recipe book included.\n\nBuy now\n\nVorwerk Thermomix TM6 multi-cooker: \u00a31,099, Vorwerk\n\nThis is the upgraded version of the all-singing, all-dancing TM5, with even more accurate scales and temperatures for sous-vide cooking, plus slow cooking and higher heat levels for caramelisation. If that\u2019s all gobbledegook to you, forget it, but if you\u2019re the kind of advanced, nerdy cook whose eyes are already lighting up, we can guarantee you\u2019ll be impressed with the sheer versatility and accurateness of this machine, as well as the fact that it doesn\u2019t stop at cooking, but also chops, blends, whisks and grinds. We like the guided recipes (great for impressing dinner party guests without actually doing very much) and the fact that it works well in either automated or manual mode. There\u2019s even a self-cleaning mode. But although the price includes a personalised demo, this machine costs a bomb.\n\nBuy now\n\nKenwood kCook CCC200WH: \u00a377.49, Amazon\n\nThis nifty model acts as a compact multi-cooker, a steamer and a chopper. It includes three main accessories to get the job done \u2013 a processing blade, stirring paddle and a steaming basket. You can use it manually or opt for a pre-set programme, we love that you can bung all the parts in to the dishwasher after use. For one-pot meals, it\u2019s a real winner \u2013 think casseroles, risottos, soups, curries and more \u2013 and with 200 recipes included, you won\u2019t run out of inspiration. This is a great machine for making light work of otherwise challenging dinners, although be warned you\u2019ll need to read the instruction manual to make the most of it. The only downsides are that it does take time to heat up and it doesn\u2019t saut\u00e9.\n\nBuy now\n\nWilko 5L multi-cooker: \u00a320, Wilko\n\nThis isn\u2019t the kind of multicooker that top chefs are going to be snapping up for their Michelin star creations, but for the basics \u2013 and especially for students looking for a one pot solution to cheap eats \u2013 this is excellent value. There are 12 auto-cooking programmes, with a genuinely non-stick cooking pot and you even get a measuring cup, rice paddle and steam pot thrown in. While it doesn\u2019t have all the bells and whistles of fancier machines, you do get a delay timer and keep warm function. Casseroles are its forte, so we think it\u2019s best to see this as a slow cooker with add-ons.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Multi-cookers\n\nThe Ninja foodi is a mid-priced multicooker and its ability to crisp up food nailed it for us \u2013 that, and the fact that it does most things well. For next level cooking, the Vorwerk Thermomix TM6 will blow keen cooks away.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
