The Fed are proven boneheads. But Trump's requested action would increase the boneheadedness.\n\nKeeping rates too low too long blows bubbles. We we are in the midst.of the third major bubble in 20 years.\n\nBesides, and as I have stated many times, there should not be a Fed in the first place to make such decisions.\n\nQuestion of the Day\n\nToday it's \"Naive Boneheads\".
