The Inca empire held them sacred, and these days, mere mortals who are acclimatized can attempt their summits. The highest peak is Licancabur, which is 19,420 feet. It is accessible to novice mountaineers, as it's not a technical climb, and although there can be snow and ice on the summit in some years, what usually turns summiters back is the lack of oxygen.\n\n\n\nPhoto courtesy of Dave Stamboulis", "description": "The Atacama Desert is one of the driest places in the world, but don't let the lack of rainfall fool you.
