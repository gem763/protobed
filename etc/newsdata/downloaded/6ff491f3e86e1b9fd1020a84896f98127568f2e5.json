In the past week, European equities saw their first inflows in 16 weeks, and the biggest inflows since February 2018, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Data Analytics. At the same time, the European Stoxx 600 index pushed to new 52-week highs.\n\nSome reasons for the bullishness: The European Central Bank\u2019s massive stimulus package in September, China\u2019s ongoing stimulus, and recently, hopes that a Brexit deal could revive growth. Germany is teetering on recession, and auto sales plunged last year following a new initiative to measure fuel consumption and emissions.\n\nRelated Data Market Data Center: Funds & ETFs\n\nNow, there\u2019s a sense that Europe will weather even a hard Brexit. On Thursday, the Institutional Strategist newsletter increased its weighting in European equities and reduced cash in its model portfolio on the theory that Europe may \u201cthrow the kitchen sink, monetarily and fiscally, at the economy,\u201d partly by boosting spending on military and security services. If so, then European stocks \u201ccould run more than the 50% to 100% moves that occurred after the [global financial crisis] and in 2012-13,\u201d the newsletter wrote. Even if United Kingdom politics are in a stalemate, the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 will benefit from a weaker pound.\n\nIan Kirwan, a London-based investment manager at Eaton Vance and manager of Calvert International Equity (ticker: CWVGX), says that he continues to have \u201cdeep-seated concerns\u201d about the longer-term health of Europe\u2019s economy. Nevertheless, in July, he began adding a \u201cfew hundred basis points\u201d to his European exposure, including cyclical names. Kirwan also added some European financials, which were trading at 20-year valuation lows amid negative interest rates: \u201cWhen you start to get improvements in the [purchasing managers reports], you get a rise in bond yields.\u201d He declined to name specific investments because he is still transacting.\n\n\u201cSome of these stocks we\u2019re looking at are already pricing in a mild recession,\u201d Kirwan says. \u201cMy outlook is that we avoid recession next year. And there\u2019s a real value opportunity in the U.K.,\u201d where home prices have fallen 15% to 20% since 2016.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the iShares MSCI Eurozone (EZU) exchange-traded fund has returned 3.1% a year, compared with 13% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). But over the past month, the iShares ETF has returned 3.6%, versus 1.4% for the SPDR ETF.\n\nValuations also favor European equities. The S&P 500 index trades at 18.3 times forward earnings and yields 1.9%. Earnings are expected to grow 5% over the next 12 months. The MSCI Euro Index, meanwhile, trades at 14 times earnings and yields 3.9%. Earnings are expected to grow 4.6%. The FTSE 100 index of U.K. blue chips trades at 13 times earnings and yields 4.9%. Earnings are expected to grow 3.7%.\n\nGiven the uncertain economic climate, blindly buying the index makes no sense, says Gertjan van der Geer of Geneva-based of Pictet Asset Management and manager of the John Hancock Global Thematic Opportunities fund (JTKAX). Among Van der Geer\u2019s picks are companies that benefit from strong, steady growth and operate in his central investment themes. One, Kingspan Group (KGSPY), is an Irish-domiciled manufacturer of building insulation, which \u201cin the goal of energy efficiency is one of the key enablers to get green or LEED certification,\u201d he says. Another is Vonovia (VNA.Germany), a German operator of smart residential buildings. \u201cThe return on invested capital is fantastic,\u201d he says.\n\nA German stimulus has yet to materialize, but the ECB has been nudging governments to boost fiscal spending amid rock-bottom borrowing costs. In May, the Green Party also won heavily in European parliament elections, demonstrating European concerns about climate change. That could mean stimulus spending on green technologies.\n\nSean Darby, the global strategist at Jefferies, has noted that green tech provides a \u201cpopulist uplift with potentially very big multipliers for the European economy.\u201d Among his recommended stocks are energy company E. ON (EOAN.Germany), wind-turbine company Nordex (NDX1.Germany), and GEA Group (G1A.Germany).\n\nBespoke recommends that investors be overweight European equities via ETFs like WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity (HEDJ), which hedges euro currency exposure,and does well when local-currency stock prices are rising. In its Bespoke Tactical Macro Portfolio, it also owns iShares MSCI Germany (EWG) and iShares MSCI Sweden (EWD).\n\nMake no mistake, Europe will remain underowned for some time.\n\n\u201cIt has been an underperformer for so long that we don\u2019t need to be first in,\u201d says Charles Ryan, a portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management, who owns no European-domiciled companies.\n\nWhat would change Ryan\u2019s mind? Significant revisions in earnings-growth estimates. For now, indicators are \u201cmodestly getting better, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d put dollars today to work in Europe as a global investor.\u201d\n\nWrite to Leslie P.
