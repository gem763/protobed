A Wall Street Journal poll of economists had tipped a 3.0% decline.\n\nImports slid 8.5% on year in September, extending August's 5.6% drop, the customs data showed. The WSJ poll had forecast a decline of 6.0%.\n\nChina's overall trade surplus stood at $39.65 billion in September, wider than August's $34.8 billion surplus and the $34.05 billion surplus that had been expected.\n\nTrade tensions between China and the U.S. have eased a little following last week's high-level trade talks, with the U.S. shelving new tariffs against Beijing while leaving many demands to be worked out later, in return for an assurance of increased agriculture purchases by China.\n\n--Lin Zhu\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 13, 2019 23:36 ET (03:36 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
