Synology unveils tiny, awesome storage unit", "language": "en", "text": "And, in a small office where you\u2019re working with Word documents and the like, it\u2019s arguably preferable to use the cloud for your files. With a NAS device, you\u2019re going to need off-site storage, anyway, just in case the office burns down, so why not cut out the middle man and store your work files direct to internet?\n\nBut on the other hand, cloud companies such as Google and Amazon do tend to be evil and at risk of data breaches, and it might be that you\u2019re loathe to trust them with all your secret files.\n\nIt may be teeny weeny on the outside, but it\u2019s absolutely huge in terms of its capabilities.\n\nOr it might be that you have too many files taking up too much space to make cloud storage a viable option, thus making a NAS a vital addition to your digital life.\n\nI\u2019d never put all my photos onto the cloud, for instance. There are too many of them, and they are too private, so instead I store them on a NAS in my home, which I sync securely over the internet to a NAS in someone else\u2019s home, just in case my house burns down.\n\nPhotos, photos and more photos... you might well run out of cloud storage in any case. AP\n\nIn any event, the Synology DS620slim is so much more than a NAS, it might be worth considering even if you\u2019re on the fence about your need for centralised storage in your home or office.\n\nThe Synology operating system that runs on the device, known as \u201cDSM\u201d, has a Package Centre with a vast number of apps in it, ranging from geeky security and authorisation servers such as OAuth and Radius, to office productivity services such as in-house chat (if you really don\u2019t trust cloud-based chat services) and word processing \u2013 apps that use the storage in the NAS, but which aren\u2019t really about storage.\n\nYou\u2019ll struggle to find some server-style application you won\u2019t be able to run on this device.\n\nThe operating system also runs Docker, an application container system that\u2019s incredibly popular in tech circles, so even if you can\u2019t find a DSM app to suit your needs, you\u2019ll almost always be able to find a Dockerised version of the app which, with a bit of know-how, you\u2019ll be able to run on the device.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve got a home automation system known as OpenHAB running in Docker on the DS620slim, for turning the lights on and off here in the Labs, and it\u2019s running flawlessly. We\u2019ve also got the Plex media server running nicely in Docker on the DS620slim, not because we couldn\u2019t find it in the DSM app store, but because we wanted more control over which version of Plex we ran.\n\nWhich is to say, you\u2019ll struggle to find some server-style application you won\u2019t be able to run on this device. It may be teeny weeny on the outside, roughly the size of a half-loaf of sliced bread (making it about a third the size of a regular NAS), but it's absolutely huge in terms of its capabilities.\n\nThe DS620slim even comes with Synology\u2019s Virtual Machine Manager, which lets you run virtual Windows, Linux and other computers inside the tiny box, in the rare case you need to do something that can\u2019t be done in DSM or in Docker.\n\nBe warned, though: the review unit we were sent had only 2 gigabytes of memory in it, and only 192 megabytes of that is available to run virtual machines. That\u2019s not nearly enough memory. Even a lightweight operating system such as Ubuntu Server has a recommended minimum memory requirement of 512 megabytes, so if you\u2019re even thinking about using the Virtual Machine Manager, make sure you upgrade the memory. We couldn\u2019t get Ubuntu Server, much less Windows Server, running on our test unit.\n\nUnless you\u2019re using your NAS for huge video files, we don\u2019t see the performance as an issue.\n\nSpeedwise, the thing is about as fast as the DS1817+ we reviewed previously. Our test unit came with two solid-state drives, which combined with its very decent Intel processor should make the DS620slim very zippy indeed for uploading and downloading files. But it\u2019s only got a 1 Gbps ethernet connection to your network, which seemed to cap its performance in our tests.\n\nUnless you\u2019re using your NAS for huge video files, however, we don\u2019t see the performance as an issue. Most users would probably be connected to their network via Wi-Fi, and it\u2019s the Wi-Fi connection that would limit the speed they\u2019d experience, not the ethernet connection between the Wi-Fi router and the DS620slim.\n\nIf storage performance really is an issue, though, you probably should steer clear of this itsy bitsy little NAS, and get something (such as the DS187+, or something newer) that lets you add a lightning-fast network connection.\n\nThat something else would probably be a lot bigger than the DS620slim, but never mind! You can always sit it on the floor under a desk, or in a cupboard somewhere. Anywhere with a bit of ventilation.\n\nSize has never been much of an issue with NAS devices, anyhow, which does make us wonder why Synology bothered shrinking the DS620slim in the first place.\n\nI guess it\u2019s like shrinking Twisties packets. Because you can. Because it\u2019s fun. And because, if things really do start to heat up in your house, like an oven, you can always just grab this little NAS with one hand and make a run for it.\n\nSYNOLOGY DS620SLIM\n\nLikes Fast enough; huge number of great apps\n\nDislikes Not enough memory for the most advanced usage\n\nPrice $849 plus cost of disks", "description": "Do you have too many files taking up too much space to make cloud storage a viable option?
