Rory McIlroy\u2019s playing of the final two holes of the Wentworth west course in three over par on Thursday left him embroiled in a second-day battle just to make the BMW PGA Championship cut. McIlroy duly reached the 17th tee needing to play the last two holes of his second round in level to take his place in Saturday\u2019s draw. A chip in from behind the 16th green meant McIlroy needed two, error-free holes; five-five would suffice.\n\nThe four-times major winner delivered a straightforward par on 17 before carving an approach to the last right. A chip from a treacherous position left McIlroy with two putts from 40ft to make the cut. He left the first 6ft short, proving how a sense of drama is never far from this golfer\u2019s scene. McIlroy converted confidently from there; his 69 and one-over-par aggregate means 36 more holes.\n\nThe tournament organisers, never mind McIlroy, breathed a sigh of relief. He might be a dozen shots from the lead but the 30-year-old\u2019s very involvement here raises the championship\u2019s profile. \u201cI\u2019m still not in sync with everything but I battled well,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cMy alignment has been off and it\u2019s hard when that happens.\u201d\n\nAt the business end of proceedings Jon Rahm has tied Danny Willett at 11 under par. Willett\u2019s 65 on Friday was two strokes better than Rahm, who is seeking a fourth victory in one of the European Tour\u2019s marquee Rolex Series events.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great golf course,\u201d said the Spaniard. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love coming back to Europe to play these traditional style golf courses, where they are not long, they are not overly complicated but things can get difficult for a player real quick. They make you think about it. You can be as aggressive or as conservative as you want off the tee and make it fun that way.\u201d\n\nWillett had played his outward half in 29 shots, rendering a back nine of 36 something of a disappointment for galleries who sensed records could be broken. Willett, though, is perfectly content with his halfway position. The former Masters champion is a firm advocate of this tournament in September, switched from its previous slot in May.\n\n\u201cIt is a better date,\u201d Willett said. \u201cOur summers are kind of going later on in the year and our winters are moving to January, February, March. To try and get this golf course in great condition in May has always been a pretty tough task for the guys. They have done a great job of it but this year with that few extra months gives time for the sun to come out, the heat to come through and the growth to be more even. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see some good scoring. We are not getting too many iffy lies out there and the greens are rolling really well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best condition I\u2019ve seen it in the 10 years I\u2019ve been here. It\u2019s all set up for a really good weekend.\u201d\n\nJustin Rose, Henrik Stenson and Christiaan Bezuidenhout are tied at minus nine. Rose continues to defy the odds; the 39-year-old arrived in Surrey with an injured knee after slipping last week.", "description": "Jon Rahm and Danny Willett lead the PGA Championship at half-way while Rory McIlroy made the cut at Wentworth with a dramatic two-putt finish on the last hole", "authors": ["Ewan Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c90ef57737a9de53231a0b0ecdbe6a36578f101/0_230_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f7516c21fc57b623877848257e24fc9", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
