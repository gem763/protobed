The British media has reported the then-married mayor made visits to her flat in Shoreditch, a London neighborhood of tech startups, but no proof has emerged she was involved in an intimate relationship with Johnson.\n\nArcuri said she didn\u2019t want to \u201cfeed the story\u201d by describing her relationship with Johnson, yet she\u2019s mortified at the damage the scandal is doing to his political fortunes as the U.K. hurtles toward Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cI will not be the person to bring Boris Johnson down,\u201d Arcuri, 34, said. \u201cI refuse to be a pawn.\u201d\n\nFor the last few days, Arcuri said she\u2019s been inundated with five-digit offers from British television programs and tabloids eager to land a bombshell interview that would shed light on her connection with Johnson.\n\nInquiries\n\nOn Sept. 22, the Sunday Times of London reported that Johnson may have used his influence to get two of Arcuri\u2019s companies, Innotech Network Ltd. and Hacker House Ltd., economic development grants from the city and places on trade missions overseas. Officials have begun three inquiries into the grants made to her firms, including a police investigation referred by the Greater London Authority.\n\nJohnson has denied giving Arcuri and her companies any favorable treatment and has said that he acted \u201cwith full propriety.\u201d While Arcuri said Johnson\u2019s participation in her startup conferences gave her business a huge boost she also denies any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI know in my heart of hearts that Boris didn\u2019t do me any favors,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a determined businesswoman and I was within my rights to go on those trade missions and apply for grants. I\u2019m not some Tory girl. And my relationship with Boris is nobody\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Edward Robinson in London at edrobinson@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, James Ludden, Howard Chua-Eoan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Jennifer Arcuri, the American entrepreneur swept up in a tabloid storm involving Boris Johnson, said Friday that she won\u2019t discuss her relationship with the British premier but remains loyal to the man she calls a \u201cgood friend.\u201dIn a telephone interview with Bloomberg News, the first she", "authors": ["Edward Robinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
