It was also Uruguay\u2019s first World Cup win in 16 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to play here,\u201d Uruguay captain Juan Manuel Gaminara said.\n\nThe new stadium was sited where two schools sat before they were washed away on March 11, 2011. All of the children escaped, although a woman working in the elementary school stayed behind and perished.\n\nHer body has never been found.\n\nRui Horaguchi, who is now 18 and escaped by running from the school, told reporters before the match of her ordeal. And she thanked those who helped.\n\nVolunteers also unfurled a banner on the field before the match. It read: \u201cThank you for your support during the 3.11 earthquake and tsunami.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy house was washed away in the waves and I remember we had donations from across the world,\u201d Horaguchi explained. \u201cThis has really helped the community to come together. I am hopeful that we will maintain that unity to work together and make it even better.\u201d\n\nKamaishi will also host Namibia and Canada for a Rugby World Cup match on Oct. 13.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCu p and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Just 90 minutes after Uruguay shook the Rugby World Cup with an upset win over Fiji, the venue in Kamaishi was shaken for real by a moderate earthquake on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Wade"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/japan_rugby_wcup_fiji_uruguay_53600_c0-166-3968-2479_s1770x1032.jpg?b2659f1ab72ea6c2d336a456b03dba6ca37f085a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
