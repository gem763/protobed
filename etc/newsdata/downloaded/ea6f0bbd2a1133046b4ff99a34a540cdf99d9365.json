Photos: Kenneth Chan\n\nJohn Moore has made his opinion of Aethero\u2019s ability very clear but Voyage Warrior\u2019s trainer Ricky Yiu Poon-fai is confident he takes the best horse into Saturday\u2019s mouth-watering speed battle at Sha Tin.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s two hottest up-and-coming sprint prospects lock horns for the first time in the Class Two Wo Tik Handicap (1,000m) and Yiu expects his lightning-quick four-year-old to extend his record to four wins from five starts.\n\n\u201cI think my horse has got the best chance,\u201d Yiu said. \u201cMine\u2019s a four-year-old and [Aethero] is only three, he\u2019s a year older with a similar rating.\u201d\n\nVoyage Warrior looked hot as he warmed up for an expected clash with Aethero #HKracing pic.twitter.com/73ipcdFdcc \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 4, 2019\n\nMoore\u2019s Thanks Forever, who handed Voyage Warrior his only loss back in May, is also in the race, but Yiu believes he holds all the aces in the form of star jockey Zac Purton, who was aboard Voyage Warrior, Thanks Forever and Aethero at their last starts.\n\n\u201cHe knows all the horses and you need a winning jockey,\u201d the trainer said.\n\nJoao Moreira climbs aboard Aethero for the first time, while Chad Schofield and Thanks Forever team up in another first.\n\nAfter taking out a trial in blistering style last week, Yiu confirmed Voyage Warrior will race in a tongue tie for the first time as he makes his seasonal debut on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll run him with the tongue tie on for the first time, he trialled well with it on,\u201d Yiu said.\n\n\u201cHe proved in the trial that everything is OK with the tongue tie, the main thing is that I hope he can settle more,\u201d Yiu added in reference to that trial, where Voyage Warrior exploded from the blocks, strode to a big lead and saluted by over eight lengths.\n\nThe Group One Longines Hong Kong Sprint (1,200m) in December is the grand final for both Voyage Warrior and Aethero, however anything short of a win on the weekend could make acquiring the required rating difficult.\n\nDespite that, Yiu declared he has no plan B should Voyage Warrior go under: \u201cNot yet, I\u2019m pretty confident he\u2019ll be very, very close on Saturday.\u201d\n\nShould all go to plan, the 62-year-old suggested the Group Two Jockey Club Sprint (1,200m) on November 17 could be the galloper\u2019s only other run between now and international day.\n\nIt would be Voyage Warrior\u2019s first start beyond 1,000m but Yiu can\u2019t see the step-up to six furlongs being an issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see how he can cope with the 1,200m, but to me I don\u2019t think he will have any problem coming round the bend when he steps up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think if we can get him up to a rating of more than 100 he should be able to participate in the international sprint.\u201d\n\nAdding even more spice to the contest is Tony Millard\u2019s Refined Treasure, with the five-year-old\u2019s last six runs down the straight netting four wins and two seconds.\n\nMillard has previously stated his desire to race Refined Treasure at Group One level, however the gelding is yet to fire at 1,200m and looks destined to remain a 1,000m specialist.\n\nOf the others, Tony Cruz\u2019s Multimillion is chasing his sixth victory at the course and distance and very rarely performs poorly at his pet trip, however Class Two against this quality of field will likely prove a bridge too far for the honest five-year-old.", "description": "John Moore has made his opinion of Aethero\u2019s ability very clear but Voyage Warrior\u2019s trainer Ricky Yiu Poon-fai is confident he takes the best horse into Saturday\u2019s mouth-watering speed battle at Sha Tin....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/10/6d4a8d5a-ea94-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_144633.JPG?itok=8xjYepET&v=1570690001", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
