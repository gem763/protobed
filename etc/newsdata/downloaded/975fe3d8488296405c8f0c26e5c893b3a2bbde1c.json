How we treat our fellow human beings defines who we are.\u201d\n\nGomez also revealed that she was approached in 2017 about being an executive producer for a Netflix series called \u201cLiving Undocumented\u201d, which follows eight immigrant families in the US facing possible deportation.\n\nAccording to the I Can\u2019t Get Enough singer, she watched footage from the series and cried because it captures \u201cthe shame, uncertainty and fear\u201d that her own family faced.\n\n\u201cBut it also captured the hope, optimism, and patriotism so many undocumented immigrants still hold in their hearts despite the hell they go through,\u201d she wrote.\n\nGomez concluded the op-ed explaining that she is \u201cconcerned\u201d by the way immigrants are being treated in the US, but that she hopes to use her platform to help.\n\nAnd while Gomez anticipates facing criticism for her involvement in the show, she said the criticism is \u201cnothing compared to what undocumented immigrants face every day\u201d.\n\n\u201cFear shouldn\u2019t stop us from getting involved and educating ourselves on an issue that affects millions of people in our country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFear didn\u2019t stop my aunt from getting into the back of that truck. And for that, I will always be grateful.\u201d", "description": "Selena Gomez has reflected on immigration and her own family\u2019s journey to America, while revealing\u00a0she is fearful for the future of the country.
