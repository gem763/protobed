Amy Klobuchar said on Monday that she has raised $2 million since last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate.\n\n\u201cI knew that I wasn\u2019t the one that was going to start out with all the name identification, and I also knew that I would slowly but surely gain, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d the Minnesota Democrat said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d\n\nMs. Klobuchar had reported raising $4.8 million during the entire third quarter and started October with about $3.7 million on hand \u2014 still well back of the top-tier contenders in the race.\n\nBut she has seen a slight uptick in some polling since last week\u2019s debate, where she confronted Sen. Elizabeth Warren on how the Massachusetts Democrat plans to pay for her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan.\n\n\u201cI know that Sen. Warren said that she\u2019s going to come out to explain how she is going to pay for it \u2014 I think that\u2019s good,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said, saying she supports a government-run \u201cpublic option\u201d that would compete with private health insurance plans.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
