Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Rainbow PUSH broadcast and community forum, in Chicago, Ill., June 29, 2019. (Kamil Krzaczynski/Reuters)\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) on Tuesday slammed a proposal reportedly being pushed by the chairman of the New York State Democratic Party that would place more hurdles in front of third parties seeking to appear on the ballot, calling the plan \u201cdeeply undemocratic.\u201d\n\nThe proposal, which targets the New York Working Families Party, would dramatically hike the voter threshold for third parties to appear on the gubernatorial ballot from 50,000 votes to 250,000 votes, alleviating the headache the party has caused for Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo. The new threshold amounts to just under two percent of New York\u2019s over 12 million registered voters.\n\nState Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs suggested the voter hike in a private email sent earlier this month to a number of state commissioners engaged in a review of New York election law, the New York Times reported.\n\n\u201cThis proposal comes from, of all places, a commission meant to improve our democracy. But attacking the @NYWFP is deeply undemocratic\u2014and it will only benefit Republicans,\u201d the Massachusetts senator said in a tweet.\n\n\u201cNo Democrat should allow this to pass,\u201d Warren added.\n\nThe Working Families Party endorsed Warren for president last month, a switch from the party\u2019s endorsement of Senator Bernie Sanders during his first presidential bid in 2016. Critics raised eyebrows over a reported $45,000 in donations last year to the party from the think tank Demos, which is chaired by Warren\u2019s daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi.\n\nMeanwhile, some Sanders supporters complained about the endorsement and suggested the party has \u201csomething to hide.\u201d\n\nJacobs claims New York\u2019s third party voter threshold effort is meant to address voter confusion as well as crack down on \u201csham\u201d parties that trade their appearance on the ballot for political favors.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have been getting away with an awful lot for a long time,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cIn my mind, it will be better overall if elections are run with only really credible parties.\u201d\n\nCuomo, who has admitted he knew Jacobs\u2019 stance on the Working Families Party when he appointed him to the commission, has been accused of being behind the effort to undermine third parties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our proposal, but ultimately legislators would have the option to weigh in on what the commission ultimately decides,\u201d said Rich Azzopardi, a senior Cuomo adviser.\n\nThe Working Families Party is the second largest third party in New York behind the Conservative Party, which garnered more than 250,000 votes during the last election for governor.", "description": "A proposal is reportedly being pushed that would place more hurdles in front of third parties seeking to appear on the ballot.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
