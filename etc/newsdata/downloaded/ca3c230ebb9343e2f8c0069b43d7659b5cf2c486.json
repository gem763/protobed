REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/Files\n\nThe Australian AUD=D3 and New Zealand dollars NZD=D3 led gains against the greenback after Bloomberg reported the United States is weighing a currency pact with China which could see a planned tariff hike next week being suspended.\n\nWith negotiations between Beijing and Washington getting underway on Thursday, market watchers say any concessions from China would be touted as a success from U.S. officials and that might fuel further yen weakness and gains in the Aussie dollar.\n\n\u201cThe (U.S.) President should be keen to achieve that, in particular during the election campaign. ..I think the optimism has risen repeatedly over the past few days,\u201d Ulrich Leuchtmann, an FX strategist at Commerzbank said in a daily note.\n\nA currency pact would pave the way for further negotiations on core issues such as intellectual property and forced technology transfers with reports that Beijing has offered to increase purchases of agricultural goods further signaling a thaw in trade tensions.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether a partial trade deal will be acceptable for President Trump who wants to secure a broader agreement,\u201d MUFG strategists said.\n\nAgainst a basket of its rivals .DXY, the dollar weakened 0.3% to 98.845, nearing a one-week low.
