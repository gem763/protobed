The changes will not affect full-time employees.\n\nWhole Foods said it was making the change \"to better meet the needs of our business and create a more equitable and efficient scheduling model.\"\n\n\"The small percentage of part-time team members ... who previously opted into medical benefits through Whole Foods Market's healthcare plan \u2014 less than 2% of our total workforce \u2014 will no longer be eligible to buy into medical coverage through the company,\" the Whole Foods spokesperson said.\n\nRead more: Walmart US CEO says half his store visits make him 'grumpy' \u2014 and he's turning up the heat on managers\n\n\"We are providing team members with resources to find alternative healthcare coverage options, or to explore full-time, healthcare-eligible positions starting at 30 hours per week. All Whole Foods Market team members continue to receive employment benefits including a 20% in-store discount.\"\n\nA 15-year employee of Whole Foods said she was devastated by the news.\n\nShe told Business Insider in an interview that her family was covered by the health-insurance plan she is enrolled in through her job at Whole Foods.\n\nShe said she would have to increase her hours to become eligible for full-time benefits and pay for childcare, or shop for a new and potentially more expensive health-insurance plan on the private marketplace. She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\n\"I am in shock,\" she said. \"I've worked here 15 years. This is why I keep the job \u2014 because of my benefits.\"\n\nIf you work for Whole Foods, reach out to this reporter at hpeterson@businessinsider.com.", "description": "The Amazon-owned grocer started notifying some employees this week of the changes, sources told Business Insider.", "authors": ["Hayley Peterson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d656faa2e22af1d361f54c3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
