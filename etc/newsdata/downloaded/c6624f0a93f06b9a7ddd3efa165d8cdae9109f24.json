Two of those sources said that State Department officials, including Secretary Mike Pompeo, are also open to weighing the French proposal, which would effectively ease the economic sanctions regime that the Trump administration has applied on Tehran for more than a year.\n\nThe deal put forth by France would compensate Iran for oil sales disrupted by American sanctions. A large portion of Iran\u2019s economy relies on cash from oil sales. Most of that money is frozen in bank accounts across the globe. The $15 billion credit line would be guaranteed by Iranian oil. In exchange for the cash, Iran would have to come back into compliance with the nuclear accord it signed with the world\u2019s major powers in 2015.", "description": "", "authors": ["Banco"], "top_image": ""}
