Experts say the rock paintings in Serra Lua show humans occupied that part of the lower Amazon at least 11,000 years ago. Large yellow and red hand drawings and circles are found over a 200-meter (200-yard) stretch.\n\nFires in the Amazon broke out at a pace unseen since 2010 in July and August but slowed in September.\n\nPope Francis urged bishops on Sunday to protect the environment and indigenous communities in the Amazon.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
