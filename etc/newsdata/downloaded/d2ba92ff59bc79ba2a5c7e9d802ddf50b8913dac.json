Their presence is inferred from radiation emitted as gas and debris swirl around them.\n\nIn 1996, astronomers became aware of a strange glow radiating from the Magellanic Stream.\n\nScientists began to hunt for a cause and Sagittarius A* became the prime suspect.\n\nBased on a recent analysis of the data gathered by the Hubble Space Telescope, the researchers calculated the massive explosion took place 3.5 million years ago.\n\n(Image: EHT Collaboration)\n\nThey believe the blast lasted for around 300,000 years.\n\nMagda Guglielmo, from the University of Sydney and one of the study authors, said: \"These results dramatically change our understanding of the Milky Way.\n\n\"We always thought about our galaxy as an inactive galaxy, with a not-so-bright centre.\n\n\"These new results instead open the possibility of a complete reinterpretation of its evolution and nature.\n\n\"The flare event that occurred three million years ago was so powerful that it had consequences on the surrounding of our galaxy.\n\n\"We are the witness to the awakening of the sleeping beauty.\"", "description": "Scientists believe the blast lasted for around 300,000 years", "authors": ["Nilima Marshall", "Sophie Curtis", "Image", "James Josephides Astro", "Bland-Hawthorne", "Et Al Astro", "Eht Collaboration"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529143.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/213073_web.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
