He told Human Resources chiefs: 'I will collect my things and go.'\n\nThomas drove to Southerndown in the Vale of Glamorgan where he and his family had enjoyed walks along the coastal path.\n\nThomas's wife Rebecca, pictured with her husband, said she believed whatever happened in the disciplinary meeting was 'fundamental' to what had happened to change the state of his mind\n\nIn a written statement his wife Rebecca said she became concerned when her husband failed to respond to text messages that evening.\n\nShe spoke to one of her husband's work colleagues at 10.15 who advised her to call police to register him as a missing person.\n\nHis body was found by coastguard at Southerndown the next day.\n\nLorraine Kilborn, Eversheds Sutherland's international HR director, told the hearing she became aware of the allegations of inappropriate behaviour the day after the Christmas party.\n\nShe said: 'We decided this was something we needed to consider very seriously.\n\nOn the day he died, Thomas was suspended from Evershards Sutherland, pictured, where he was a Brexit lawyer\n\nThomas' body was found at the base of Southerndown Cliff tops in Cardiff\n\n'We arranged to meet at 8am on Monday morning to discuss matters further and after going through the main points I made the decision to suspend Geraint.'\n\nMrs Kilborn said Thomas was 'calm, quiet and professional' and made no comment about the allegations put to him.\n\nShe added that the firm offered to carry out the investigation within three days to allow him to carry on with his holiday.\n\nThe HR director said the investigation was halted when the firm 'learned of the tragic circumstances of his death'.\n\nSenior partner Anthony Rees said Mrs Kilborn told him a complaint had been received about alleged inappropriate sexual behaviour.\n\nIn a written statement he told the hearing: 'A number of individuals had raised complains about Geraint behaviour at two events.\n\n'At the meeting he was told he would be given a full opportunity to answer the allegations and support was offered.'\n\nThe inquest heard Thomas said 'thank you' as he left the meeting at 12.55pm on December 17.\n\nThomas joined Eversheds Sutherland in 1994 and spent his entire career with the firm. He was a partner in the firm's commercial department.\n\nAfter his death the firm said in a statement: 'Geraint was a truly exceptional lawyer, he will be remembered for his dedication to his clients and to the firm in equal measure.'\n\nDetective Chief inspector Mark Lewis told the hearing that Thomas's mobile phone had internet searches on Brexit and cricket but nothing to indicate he intended suicide.\n\nHe said: 'There were traumatic messages from Mr Thomas\u2019s wife and children pleading for him to come home which remained unanswered.'\n\nA post mortem examination revealed Thomas, of Radyr, Cardiff, died of multiple injuries 'in keeping with a fall from a height'.\n\nActing South Wales Central Senior Coroner Graeme Hughes said there was no direct evidence that Thomas jumped from the cliffs.\n\nHe said: 'It is a possibility that in the dark and in heavy rain he simply travelled too close and either stepped or fell and was blown off the edge.\n\n'Suicide must be proved and there was no evidence that he formed any intention, there were no notes either at home or in his car.\n\n'There were no text messages and no evidence of suicidal ideation.'\n\nRecording a narrative verdict the coroner concluded: 'The deceased died as a consequence of catastrophic injury defending from the cliffs.\n\n'The circumstances cannot be sufficiently determined on the available evidence.'\n\nHis widow declined comment on the result of the hearing as she left the court.", "description": "Geraint Thomas, 47, fell to his death after leaving a disciplinary meeting in Cardiff convened following allegations he behaved inappropriately towards female colleagues.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19538998-0-image-a-28_1570711371011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
