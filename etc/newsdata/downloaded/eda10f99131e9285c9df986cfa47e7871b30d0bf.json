In this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users.\u201d\n\nThe content of the email published in Bloomberg\u2019s story is similar to a post said to be a leaked memo to staff from Cook that was published on the website Pastebin on Thursday.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson did not respond to Business Insider\u2019s inquiry about whether the memo posted on Pastebin was legitimate.\n\nCook\u2019s email echoes the comment Apple issued earlier in response to its decision to remove the app, a choice that has come under criticism. See below for the full statement Apple issued to Business Insider earlier on Thursday regarding its decision to remove HKmap.live from the App Store.\n\nWe created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong. Many concerned customers in Hong Kong have contacted us about this app and we immediately began investigating it. The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\n\nApple removed the app after People\u2019s Daily, the newspaper run by the Chinese Communist Party, slammed the iPhone maker for keeping the app on its store. Since Apple removed the app, officials such as US Sen. Josh Hawley and Charles Mok, Hong Kong\u2019s information technology legislator, have rallied against the decision.", "description": "Business Insider - Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a staff email that the app HKmap.live was being used to \"maliciously target individual officers for violence.\".
