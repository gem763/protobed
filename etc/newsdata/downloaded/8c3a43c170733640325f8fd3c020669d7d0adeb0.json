But rather than brawling as he infamously did after his win over McGregor, Nurmagomedov instead embraced UFC president Dana White to celebrate his victory.\n\nAfter the fight, Nurmagomedov and Poirier both expressed their respect for each other, exchanging shirts in a sportsmanlike move. Nurmagomedov said that he would auction off Poirier's shirt and donate the proceeds to his opponents charity.\n\nWith the win, \"The Eagle\" further cemented his status as the most dominant fighter in the lightweight division. Plenty of potential opponents loom for Nurmagomedov, with No. 1 lightweight contender Tony Ferguson a clear choice as the next in line for a title shot.\n\nWhile McGregor has also expressed interest in a rematch with Nurmagomedov, the champion has said that McGregor should have to win another fight before getting a shot at the belt.\n\nA friend of Conor McGregor says the UFC star will have one great advantage over Khabib Nurmagomedov if they fight again\n\nDana White barred BJ Penn from fighting in the UFC after recent footage showed him getting in a street fight\n\nYet another elite UFC fighter is calling Conor McGregor 'irrelevant'\n\nA fighter being hailed as the next Ronda Rousey says the comparison is unfair because she's actually way better", "description": "Khabib Nurmagomedov continued his run as the most dominant fighter in the lightweight division with a win over Dustin Poirier.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d74262d2e22af476c62f914-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
