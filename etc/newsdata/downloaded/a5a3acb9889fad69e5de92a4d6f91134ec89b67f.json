According to Yardeni Research, Inc, the energy sector has gained 3.9 percent year to date to September 26, compared with an 18.8-percent increase in the S&P 500 index. Energy was the second worst performer among the major sectors in the S&P 500, with only health care trailing it with a 3.7-percent gain.\n\nRelated: Trump Scrambles To Win Back Angry Farmers\n\nJP Morgan expects energy stocks to rebound over the next year, thanks to the improving global economy and a stabilization of the business cycle\u2014a somewhat contrarian view to the bears who see a recession and massive stock market drops just around the corner.\n\n\u201cWith renewed synchronized global monetary easing and stimulus underway, liquidity conditions are starting to improve, which often leads to actual economic growth by about six months,\u201d Lakos-Bujas wrote in his note, as carried by Barron\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the economy that makes JP Morgan bullish on energy.\n\nWhile investors continue to steer clear of the sector, insiders are buying energy stocks, which typically points to executives believing in the value of the investment at a bargain price.\n\nAnd oil and gas stocks are trading at bargain prices right now, JP Morgan says.\n\nRelated: Chinese LNG Imports See Strong Growth This Summer\n\n\u201cAbsolute and relative valuations are at lows with small-cap E&Ps [exploration & production] trading below book value and at price levels seen almost 25 years ago,\u201d Lakos-Bujas said in the note, Yahoo reports.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, corporate sentiment is bullish with insider purchases rising to cycle highs and shareholder return at ~6% with stronger buyback announcements and higher dividends,\u201d according to the equity strategist.\n\nHigher oil prices will also help the energy sector over the next year, JP Morgan says. The investment bank sees oil price rising to US$80 a barrel in 2020\u2014contrary to many forecasts of continued low oil prices because of an expected oversupply on the market.\n\nWith higher oil prices and the global economy stabilizing, JP Morgan expects energy stocks, especially those of exploration and production (E&P) companies, to be one of the main beneficiaries of the more stable business cycle.\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s bullish view may seem contrary to the doom-and-gloom scenarios that many analysts have painted over the past months, but it\u2019s certainly not the only bullish voice on Wall Street.\n\nGoldman Sachs has just said that it sees U.S. energy stocks as a buying opportunity at bargain prices right now. The energy sector has the potential to post the biggest gain over the next 12 months, Wall Street sell-side analysts and stocks experts said last month.\n\nThe sector has started to show some signs that oil and gas stocks may be close to breaking out of the downward trend. The recent selloff in energy stocks and energy-tracking funds may have been overdone, Jonas Elmerraji, senior market analyst at Baltimore-based Agora Financial, said earlier this month.\n\n\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Energy stocks are remarkably cheap following a period of heightened volatility, but the sector has started to show some signs that oil and gas stocks may be close to breaking out", "authors": ["Tsvetana Paraskova"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
