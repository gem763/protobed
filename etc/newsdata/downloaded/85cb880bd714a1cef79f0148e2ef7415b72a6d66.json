Culturally, it is a genuinely global company rather than a collection of country fiefdoms.\u2019\n\nComgest co-manager Alistair Wittet says: \u2018We like Heineken\u2019s focus on premium beer which continues to outgrow the beer market overall, while we see more immediately an opportunity to capture market share against an overindebted and cost focused competitor in Ab InBev.\u2019\n\n... or sample the mixer that truly went with a fizz Success story: Fever-Tree It's not alcohol but it wouldn\u2019t be the success story it is without it. From its launch in 2004 Fever Tree has become a ubiquitous part of the pub scene. Its challenge to the unquestioned dominance of market leader Schweppes with its natural quinine tonic water took many by surprise but its success has been phenomenal. It is now sold in 75 countries worldwide and its shares, floated on the stock market for 165p in 2014 are now worth about \u00a324, having reached a peak of more than \u00a338 a year ago. \u2018The question is whether they can continue to grow,\u2019 says Darius McDermott of Chelsea Financial Services. \u2018The next big challenge for them is breaking into the US market which is more focused on dark mixers for drinks such as whisky and rum, and whether they can continue to be innovative. The shares are certainly more attractive at \u00a325 than nearer \u00a340.\u2019\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s largest brewer, recently cut its dividend but that hasn\u2019t deterred Carl Stick, manager of fund Rathbone Income, from increasing his holding.\n\nHe says: \u2018Investors have been worried about the high level of debt, but its management are more relaxed. They decided they were not being rewarded for paying a high dividend to shareholders, so instead decided to cut it and pay down some of the money owed.\n\n'To me this makes it a more attractive business and I welcome the move. I have since topped up the fund\u2019s holding as the dividend growth potential from here looks more promising.\u2019\n\nSpirits producer Pernod Ricard is another popular option with fund managers. Held by RWC Continental European Equity and Threadneedle European Select, it owns brands such as Beefeater gin, Absolut vodka, Malibu and Mumm Champagne.\n\nDavid Dudding, manager of the Threadneedle fund says: \u2018Pernod Ricard has significant exposure to India and China, which should contribute most of the growth in luxury spirits in the future.\n\n'It\u2019s a leading player in a consolidated cognac market through Martell, has good cash flow and a solid balance sheet which could allow for share buybacks and bolt-on acquisitions.\u2019\n\nDiageo is also a firm favourite of professional investors. It is a holding in AXA Framlington UK Select Opportunities, Investec UK Alpha and Smith & Williamson Enterprise, to name a few. Its brands includes Guinness, Baileys, Johnnie Walker whisky and Captain Morgan rum.\n\nAccording to Smith & Williamson: \u2018Diageo is a stable compounder that has generated consistent top-line growth, margin expansion and growing cashflows, with a focus on value creation for shareholders.\u2019\n\nMcDermott agrees: \u2018Diageo has many brands which are diversified across different product areas.\u2019\n\nBrown-Forman is best known for its bourbon whiskey Jack Daniel\u2019s and has a great heritage, according to Torcail Stewart, co-manager of Baillie Gifford Strategic Bond. He owns one of the company\u2019s bonds in his portfolio.\n\nHe says: \u2018The firm has been owned and managed by the Brown family since 1870. They have proved to be excellent long-term stewards of capital, running the business with low levels of debt, while successfully expanding beyond the US to create a global beverage brand.\u2019\n\nBUY IN TO UK PUB OPERATORS\n\nOwners of pubs are also worth considering as investments. Greene King, one of Britain\u2019s leading pub retailers and brewers, is a long-standing holding in The City of London Investment Trust. It was the subject of a takeover bid recently, and its shares rose sharply on the back of news it was being bought by CK Asset of Hong Kong.\n\nIts Midlands rival Marston\u2019s was recently rated a share \u2018buy\u2019 by broker The Share Centre with investment research analyst Tom Rosser saying that he believed the company\u2019s debt reduction plan would boost its long-term sustainability.\n\nBrexit and pub company JD Wetherspoon have become intertwined as founder Tim Martin is a vocal leave campaigner. The company recently came under the spotlight as it revealed a fall in profits. Its shares are still highly priced compared to the rest of the sector.\n\nThe City Pub Group is a holding in investment fund Marlborough UK Microcap Growth.\n\nIt owns and operates individually branded premium pubs in Southern England.\n\nMarlborough says: \u2018There are a number of factors that have drawn us to the company, namely its freehold property portfolio, the strong pipeline of potential deals and the central buying power of the wider group which should enable the more efficient operation of individually acquired pubs.\n\n\u2018While the sector has faced headwinds in recent years with cost inflation, we believe well-managed and premium operators are well placed to continue growing through both like-for-like sales through their differentiated offering to consumers and by acquiring, refurbishing and improving new sites.\u2019\n\nGET EXPOSURE TO START-UP BREWERS\n\nMaverick Scottish brewer BrewDog has had several rounds of fund raising\n\nInvesting in start-up drinks businesses has become popular on the back of the meteoric rise in craft breweries. Companies looking for early investment raise finance from crowd-funding sites or through the issue of \u2018beer bonds\u2019. Investor perks include discounts and access to exclusive shareholder events.\n\nMaverick Scottish brewer BrewDog has had several rounds of fund raising via its \u2018Equity for Punks\u2019 campaign. Last year, it raised more than \u00a326million of investment from 50,000 people, offering perks such as a 5 per cent discount in BrewDog bars, a 10 per cent online discount and invitations to shareholder days at the brewery.\n\nOther distillers who have raised funds from retail investors include The Wild Beer Company and the East London Liquor company. Current investment opportunities include spirits maker Asterley Bros and Leicester-based gin maker Burleighs.\n\nBut the uncertainty of success in an increasingly crowded market means these investments are not for the risk averse.\n\nMcDermott say: \u2018It\u2019s a really saturated market. For every success such as BrewDog and Meantime, there are others you\u2019ll never hear of again.\u2019", "description": "Shoppers are already stocking up on their favourite Christmas tipples but investors might think there's more value in investing in drinks than downing them.", "authors": ["Sarah Bridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
