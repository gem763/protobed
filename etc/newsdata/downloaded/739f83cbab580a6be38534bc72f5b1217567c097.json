From the automation revolution and increasingly dangerous AI to geohacking the planet and radical advances in biotechnology, here are the most futuristic developments to expect in the next 10 years.\n\nMaking predictions is easy; it\u2019s getting them right that\u2019s tough. That said, some tangible trends are emerging that should allow us to make some informed guesses about what the future will hold over the next 10 years.\n\nA new industrial revolution\n\nOf great concern, of course, is the pending automation revolution and the associated onset of technological unemployment. Indeed, the coming decade will involve considerable disruptions to the global workforce, the result of steady improvements in robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nFor example, research from 2018 predicted the loss of 75 million jobs around the world by 2022 as a result of automation, with an associated creation of 133 million jobs over the same period, for a net increase of 58 million jobs. This rather sizable swing in vocations will require significant re-training and other major adjustments. A likely trend in the 2020s, for example, will be jobs involving centaurs, that is, human-AI collaborations.\n\nP. W. Singer, author of Ghost Fleet, LikeWar, and the upcoming book Burn-In: A Novel of the Real Robotic Revolution, says we should focus less on a revolt of the robots and more on the onset of a robotics revolution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering an industrial revolution akin to the rise of the steam engine and factories,\u201d explained Singer in an email to Gizmodo. \u201cA wave of automation and AI is hitting across all sectors of society, applied everywhere from the farm and home to the battlefield. There will be incredible efficiency gains and pathways taken that humans could never have done on their own.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that the outmoding of specific jobs to robots and AI will primarily be done for economic reasons. If business owners can save money, even if it involves the massive displacement of workers, it\u2019s something they\u2019ll likely consider.\n\nSinger said people have already forgotten about the traumas inflicted by the previous industrial revolution, but we\u2019re already witnessing the disruption of jobs and roles, the altering of vote politics, the emergence of thorny legal and ethical questions and new politics and ideologies.\n\n\u201cRemember, the last industrial revolution also brought everything from our conception of modern capitalism to ideologies of socialism, communism and fascism, which we spent the next few centuries shaking out,\u201d said Singer.\n\nSociety readjusts to new normals\n\nFor every action there is a reaction, which means we\u2019re going to spend a good part of the 2020s finding new ways to adapt, recover and take full advantage of the ensuing social and technological changes. That will involve adjustments to new modes of work, altered socioeconomic dynamics, and novel ways of living and moving in our environment.\n\nRoman Yampolskiy, an AI researcher at the University of Louisville, says the capability gap between people and machines will only increase in the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cMachines will become capable of driving unsupervised, generating captivating news articles, and fully automating many jobs, including basic secretarial work, and investing,\u201d Yampolskiy told Gizmodo. \u201cAt the same time, and as a side effect of such progress, the cognitive gap between people and machines will also increase,\u201d meaning that the degree of intelligence separating AI from humans will get increasingly bigger \u2014 and not in a way that favours humans.\n\nAccording to Lyndsay Wasser, a co-chair of McMillan\u2019s Privacy and Data Protection Group and its Cybersecurity Group, the impact of widespread autonomous vehicles, or AVs, will be \u201cenormous.\u201d\n\n\u201cA number of industries will be affected, and job losses are inevitable, including both directly impacted organisations, such as taxi and tow truck companies, and associated industries like auto insurance, gas stations, and parking facilities,\u201d explained Wasser in an email to Gizmodo.\n\nThe widespread introduction of AVs will also impact on how people and households approach transportation, she said.\n\n\u201cThe cost of owning an AV makes it unlikely that most lower and middle income families will purchase such a car in the near future,\u201d said Wasser. \u201cHowever, many consumers will likely forego ownership in favour of vehicle sharing ecosystems. Although there are many predicted benefits associated with AV\u2019s\u2014such as improved safety and mobility for persons who are unable to drive\u2014the technology is associated with significant risks.\n\nIn particular, an AV could be used as a weapon if a malicious hacker or cyberterrorist gains control of the vehicle. The volume of data generated by AVs also gives rise to real privacy concerns. Although some commentators and regulators have espoused the benefits of voluntary industry codes, I predict that some governments will move toward specific laws to regulate this transformative industry.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Sarah Kaufman, the Associate Director of the NYU Rudin Centre for Transportation, believes much of the 2020s will be characterised by the rise of AVs.\n\n\u201cEveryone and everything will move in fleets,\u201d Kaufman told Gizmodo. \u201cFleets of taxis, UPS trucks, bikes and drones. No vehicle ownership in cities. Instead people will travel as part of a larger intelligence network tracking that person\u2019s calendar, mood, physical makeup, and travel needs: they will be matched to the right vehicle.\u201d\n\nFor example, Kaufman predicts that phones will say things like, \u201cYou ate too much pizza last night: you\u2019re biking to work today,\u201d or \u201cSince you\u2019re taking your kid and her three friends to hockey practice, use this SUV.\u201d\n\nAll vehicles on the street will detect each other and move in perfect concert to avoid collisions and conflicts, she said. Sure, they\u2019ll move more slowly, \u201cbut safely and specific to users\u2019 needs,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 2020s could also see a dramatic change in how we live.\n\n\u201cTwenty-first century RVs will sit at cities\u2019 edges,\u201d Kaufman told Gizmodo. \u201cThey will become the new home offices, as younger generations are priced out of permanent homes, increase the number of freelance positions, and exist wherever internet access is available. Every home will be an office, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nLike a rolling stone, these mobile pioneers of the 2020s will \u201crelocate regularly,\u201d whether it be towards the Silicon Valley of the moment, to steer clear of climate-change damaged locations, or to the next desert-based music festival, she said. The \u201cnew home/office RVs will permit a nomadic life that will breathe new life into cities as populations ebb and flow, experiencing their offerings for the first time,\u201d predicted Kaufman.\n\nAn image of a fake video featuring former President Obama that shows elements of facial mapping. (Photo: AP)\n\nDeepfakes, people hacking, and other scary tech\n\n\u201cOur ability to tell if something is an AI generated fake news story or a deep fake video will be no better than random guessing,\u201d said Yampolskiy. \u201cThis will have an unprecedented impact on our democracy and social cohesion as well as privacy, safety and security issues. An explosion of social engineering attacks fuelled by advanced chat bots, using realistic, and familiar voices combined with personalised profiling will target billions of users.\u201d\n\nSinger expects to see a surge in people-hacking, in contrast to the hacking of computer networks. This will be done, he says, by driving viral ideas through likes, shares, and outright lies. Russian meddling during the 2016 U.S. election was a test of what its operatives could get away with, he said, but the big takeaway was that \u201cit works and is effective,\u201d according to Singer.\n\nThe 2020s will be a test to see if the U.S. and other targeted countries \u201ccan change their calculus and push back on this,\u201d he said. This will include \u201ccompanies taking on more responsibilities for toxic forces on their platforms... democracies developing strategies to better defend their population from digital threats,\u201d and citizens \u201cnot falling for the same old crap again and again,\u201d said Singer.\n\nFrighteningly, however, this won\u2019t be simple or easy given that hackers will increasingly leverage their powers with AI during the 2020s.\n\nFinn Brunton, associate professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, foresees two near-term technologies taking shape.\n\n\u201cFirst, the ability to generate mostly-synthetic or wholly-synthetic video \u2014 of which deepfakes are the early stage work \u2014 will get cheaper and easier fast, which, combined with image classification of existing libraries of images and video, means that you can produce custom, targeted video \u2014 to say nothing of pictures \u2014 for very small audiences, even one-offs, more or less on demand,\u201d Brunton told Gizmodo.\n\nSome of these fakes will be crude, he said, but plenty of people will still fall for these tricks.\n\nThis development, says Brunton, \u201cwill be exacerbated by bot and algorithm driven subcultures and consensus.\u201d Instead of messing around on Twitter to manipulate public opinion, actors bent on persuasion will \u201ccreate, reinforce, and amplify small isolated subcultures to push their ideas and beliefs further and further in the directions their creators want to see them go.\u201d To which he added: \u201cThis portends the emergence and proliferation of strange new militant cults \u2014 [possibly armed with] DIY drone bombs \u2014 bubbling up out of isolated individuals who neither have nor need a strong connection to empirical reality.\u201d\n\nGrimly, this reminds me of one of my own predictions for the 2020s: We could witness the first assassination of a high ranking politician or otherwise important public figure at the hands of a remotely operated, or possibly autonomous, drone. On a somewhat related note, the issue of autonomous killing machines for use in warfare will emerge in the 2020s as a contentious, hot-button, in terms of whether such devices should be allowed.\n\nSouth Korean professional Go player Lee Se-Dol reviews the match with other professional Go players after the fourth match against Google\u2019s artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo, during the Google DeepMind Challenge Match on March 13, 2016 in Seoul, South Korea.

Accordingly, an ongoing issue during the 2020s will be in addressing the black box problem, that is, acquiring a coherent understanding of an artificially intelligent system in terms of how and why it reaches its conclusions. This challenge will only get worse as the decade progresses, which is frightening because we\u2019ll eventually be out of the loop in terms of AI decision making, potentially leading to huge problems and possibly even large scale disasters.\n\nOn the topic of dangerous AI, it\u2019s highly unlikely that artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial superintelligence (ASI) will make an appearance during the 2020s, but it\u2019s a possibly that can\u2019t be discounted outright.\n\nBy AGI, computer scientists mean an artificial intellect with a broad range of capabilities, rather than a lone core competency (e.g. bots that can only play chess or poker). Put another way, an AGI would be similar, though not identical, to human intelligence in terms of its adaptability, flexibility, and power.\n\nBy comparison, ASI would be an order, or several orders, more intelligent than human-level intelligence, particularly in terms of speed, power, capability, and reach. We might be able to control an AGI, but our pending ability to constrain an ASI once it emerges remains an open \u2014 and very troubling \u2014 question. AGI may not appear during the 2020s, but we should prepare accordingly just in case.\n\nIn 1999, futurist Ray Kurzweil famously predicted that a superintelligent machine wouldn\u2019t appear until sometime around 2045 to 2050 \u2014 a prediction I still believe is within the realm of possibility. For it to suddenly emerge in the 2020s would require a rather massive technological leap, in which cognitive scientists and/or computer scientists would have to suddenly stumble upon the magic formula that conjures not just AGI, but ASI as well.\n\nThat said, the advent of AGI will herald the emergence of ASI shortly thereafter, due to the ease at which a machine, whether an emulation of the human brain or a series of complex algorithms, can be modified and improved even further. Importantly \u2014 and perhaps frighteningly \u2014 artificial intelligence, and not humans, will most likely be the architects of these next-level thinking machines. As I\u2019ve argued before, ASI will give birth to itself.\n\nConsequently, a growing social awareness about the dangers posed by powerful AI will emerge during the 2020s \u2014 a phenomenon that will likely be compared to today\u2019s burgeoning environmental movement and the global struggle to tackle climate change. Douglas Vakoch, an astrobiologist and president of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence), says that, as computers gain in power and become more human-like in both function and form, \u201cwe will feel ever more threatened, afraid that our technological children will surpass us, and perhaps even destroy us,\u201d he told Gizmodo in an email.\n\n\u201cWhen considering potential risks from future technology, one should not be content with merely analysing what\u2019s likely to happen \u2014 instead, one should look at what\u2019s possible, even if unlikely.\u201d\n\nJaan Tallinn, a computer programmer, founding member of Skype, and co-founder of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, doesn\u2019t expect the coming decade to be \u201cdrastically different\u201d than the last one.\n\n\u201cI would expect the backbone of 2020s technology be defined via gradual improvements in some fundamental and commercially valuable technologies, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and AI,\u201d explained Tallinn in an email to Gizmodo. \u201cWith that said, when considering potential risks from future technology, one should not be content with merely analysing what\u2019s likely to happen \u2014 instead, one should look at what\u2019s possible, even if unlikely.\u201d\n\nItems high on Tallinn\u2019s concern list for the 2020s includes sudden breakthroughs leading to uncontrollable, runaway AI, the misuse or accidents involving synthetic organisms, and technological miniaturisation enabling \u201cnew ways for non-state actors to cause large scale damage without attribution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis will probably also be the last decade in which we can learn to control AI,\u201d said Yampolskiy, \u201cas it becomes more capable it will take on progressively more responsibilities for managing our daily lives.\u201d\n\nRobin Hanson, an associate professor of economics at George Mason University and a research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University, is predicting a different kind of decade, in which the fascination with AI will experience somewhat of a downturn.\n\n\u201cInterest and concern regarding automation and AI has gone in big up-and-down cycles and we seem to be nearing the peak of the fourth such cycle since one peaked near the 1930s,\u201d Hanson told Gizmodo in an email. \u201cSo an easy prediction for the next decade is that we will more clearly see that this cycle is past its peak. There will be talk of how AI has been overly-hyped and a reduction of investment and media talk. There will be fewer AI conferences, startups and students enrolling in AI degree programs.\u201d\n\nHanson expects a new cycle to emerge again, peaking around 2050.\n\nInmate firefighters walk along Highway 120 after a burnout operation as firefighters continue to battle the Rim Fire near Yosemite National Park, Calif. (Photo: AP)\n\nLet\u2019s hack the planet\n\nArtificial intelligence will get scarier during the 2020s, but so will climate change. By the 2020s we should, sadly, witness an increasing number of related discomforts and disasters, from more heatwaves and droughts through to rising sea waters, storms, floods, and wildfires.\n\nThere\u2019s a very good possibility that the nations of the world will continue to fail to meet their climate targets and that the status quo approach to the environment will reign. In the place of internationally binding agreements and treaties, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll embark upon our first clumsy efforts to fix the environment through other means, namely the futuristic \u2014 and potentially risky \u2014 prospect of geoengineering.\n\nProposed solutions include efforts to increase the reflectivity of clouds, the construction of giant space reflectors, ocean fertilisation, introducing stratospheric aerosols, among other ideas. The trouble with geoengineering, however, is that we could completely screw it up and damage the climate even further. Also, once we start we won\u2019t be able to stop. Fair to say, we should expect to see the prospect of geoengineering and proposed schemes to be actively debated during the 2020s.\n\nThe possibility exists, of course, that the world will get its act together and work to reduce carbon emissions, but as Jamais Cascio, a distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future, explained to Gizmodo, the effects of this won\u2019t be immediately obvious due to a phenomenon known as \u201cclimate lag.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the complexities of the climate issue that we\u2019ll start to confront over the next ten years is the lag \u2014 technically, \u2018hysteresis\u2019 \u2014 between reductions in carbon emissions and temperature changes,\u201d said Cascio. \u201cThermal inertia, soil carbon, and a whole mess of complex systems make temperatures slow to react to carbon levels. We could cut all carbon emissions today and we would very likely see continued temperature increases for the next couple of decades.\u201d\n\nThis is an obvious environmental problem, he said, but it\u2019s also a political problem.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say to citizens who have agreed to make big changes in their lives, even sacrifices, with seemingly no beneficial results?\u201d he said. \u201cSaying \u2018It could have been worse\u2019 rarely works, and saying \u2018Trust me, your kids will love it\u2019 isn\u2019t any better, either.\u201d\n\nIn this September 25, 2014 photo, containers hold genetically modified aedes aegypti mosquitoes before being released in Panama City. (Photo: AP)\n\nBetter, more powerful biotech\n\nBiotechnologies will continue to advance during the 2020s. It will likely take another generation or two before we see genetically modified \u201cdesigner babies,\u201d but important advances in this area should occur in the next 10 years. As it stands, scientists in the U.S. and elsewhere can genetically modify human embryos for experimentation, but the cells must be destroyed within a few days. Don\u2019t expect this to change in the 2020s, but the 2030s could be a different story.\n\nPersonalised medicine, also known as precision medicine, should finally make its appearance in the 2020s, in which healthcare professionals will tailor treatments and therapies \u2014 whether genetic, environment, or lifestyle related \u2014 to the needs of specific individuals. This will be done primarily through genetic analysis, with advances in AI pushing this prospect forward; machine learning algorithms will detect patterns in large datasets, allowing healthcare practitioners to devise individualised treatments, instead of our current one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nThe CRISPR gene-editing tool will continue to make waves \u2014 and headlines \u2014 in the coming decade.\n\nIn an email to Gizmodo, Jennifer Doudna, co-inventor of CRISPR-Cas9 and biochemist at UC Berkeley, said that, within the next 10 years, \u201cwe could see new CRISPR-based individualised medicines and approaches to treat and potentially cure the most intractable genetic diseases, including sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis.\u201d In agriculture and related fields, researchers will apply CRISPR technology \u201cto grow more nutritious and robust crops and to establish \u2018gene drives\u2019 to control the spread of infectious diseases such as malaria and Zika virus,\u201d said Doudna.\n\nIndeed, the 2020s could witness the first gene drives, in which scientists attempt to genetically modify wild organisms, such as mosquitoes. But to \u201censure responsible development of these wide-ranging applications,\u201d Doudna said it\u2019ll be \u201cvital to continue public discourse about uses and regulation\u201d of these powerful technologies.\n\nIn this image released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), astronaut Richard M.

Next generation telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope and the European Extremely Large Telescope, are poised to redefine our knowledge of the galaxy. And as Vakoch explained to Gizmodo, advances in computing power will provide a big boost to SETI.\n\nWe\u2019ll soon be able to \u201cscan the heavens for signs of intelligent life at an accelerating pace, as we sift through the cosmic static for radio signals that stand out as distinctly artificial,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cBy the end of the decade, humanity will complete a survey of a million nearby stars, finally observing enough targets to have a realistic chance of finding ET if it\u2019s out there, trying to make contact,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe odds of discovering we\u2019re not alone in the universe have never been better.\u201d", "description": "With the decade winding down it\u2019s time for us to set our sights on the next one.
