U.S. stocks managed small gains on Thursday, with all three major indexes closing in the black. Some closely watched geopolitical issues had development today: The United Kingdom and European Union have agreed on a draft Brexit deal; Turkey has agreed to a five-day cease fire in northern Syria; and Beijing said it\u2019s working on the text of a trade agreement with the U.S. In terms of economic data, September\u2019s housing starts fell from the previous month, and production slipped at U.S. manufacturers, highlighting slowing economic growth.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 23.90 points, or 0.09%, to close at 27,025.88. The S&P 500 gained 8.26 points, or 0.28%, to finish at 2997.95, and the Nasdaq Composite added 32.67 points, or 0.40%, to close at 8156.85.\n\nThird-quarter earnings continued to keep an upbeat note. Honeywell International (HON) stock jumped after beating Wall Street expectations and raising full-year forecasts, while Morgan Stanley (MS), Philip Morris International (PM), and United Rentals (URI) earnings also came better than expected.\n\nThe market is also watching the Brexit development just two weeks ahead of the Oct. 31 deadline. After some setbacks in previous negotiation sessions, the U.K. and EU have reached a draft Brexit deal on Thursday, with new terms about the country\u2019s orderly exit from the bloc. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now tasked to have the deal passed by the U.K. Parliament. The British pound jumped 0.4% against the U.S. dollar following the news.\n\nShare Your Market Predictions Barron\u2019s wants to know your thoughts on the market, the economy, and the political landscape.

Johnson knows he\u2019s been backed into a corner. Given that the EU reportedly said they wouldn\u2019t agree to an extension beyond Oct. 31, he had no alternative but to try to reach an agreement with the EU or face a no-deal Brexit that day. Given that Parliament had passed a law instructing him not to allow that to happen, if he hadn\u2019t reached a deal, he would\u2019ve immediately faced a vote of no-confidence, which he would\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nBauman thinks Johnson\u2019s deal is significantly worse than the one Teresa May\u2019s government had negotiated, which was overwhelmingly rejected several times by parliament. \u201cThe animosity toward Johnson is so strong, from so many quarters, that there is no way the UK\u2019s other major parties are going to reward him by approving a deal forced on them by Johnson\u2019s own incompetence,\u201d wrote Bauman on Thursday.\n\nStill, the threat of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d clouds the country\u2014if the parliament refuses to ratify the deal, the U.K. would leave the EU at the end of the month without a deal, a move that can bring many potential disruptions to the region\u2019s economy. In that case, Bauman expects the EU to unilaterally extend the deadline: \u201cThis one isn\u2019t over by a long shot.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the latest data suggest that construction on U.S. new houses slipped 9% in September from the previous month to reach an annual rate of 1.26 million. But the larger trend still looks promising for the housing market, and a recent surge in permits suggests that the decline in housing starts is just a brief pause from its 12-year high in August.\n\nHousing stocks have been strong in 2019 driven by the lower mortgage rates, with the SPDR S&P Homebuilders exchange-traded fund (XHB) rallying nearly 40% year to date, doubling the S&P 500\u2019s 20% gain. The ETF jumped 0.9% on Thursday despite the lower numbers in new buildings.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "U.S. stocks managed small gains on Thursday, with all three major indexes closing in the black.
