We have a cover-up\u2014which suggests, to me, consciousness of guilt,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt won\u2019t take a lot of time to present the evidence. And I think that there\u2019s a lot of evidence that is going to lead people to probably a quick decision.\u201d\n\nPunditry is an odd spot for Harris, whose breakout moments have come in committee hearings\u2014like the run-in with Attorney General William Barr during his confirmation hearing in May when she asked, \u201cHas the president or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?\u201d Barr started stammering, and wondered out loud, \u201cThe president or anybody else \u2026\u201d as Harris pressed him for a yes or no. \u201cI\u2019m trying to grapple with the word suggest,\u201d Barr told her.\n\nAdd that response to the evidence file, Harris said, now that the summary of the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky includes Trump trying to connect Kiev officials with Barr, who was reportedly busy flying around the world, allegedly trying to enlist foreign intelligence officials\u2019 help in undermining the findings of American intelligence officials and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\u201cI would really want to believe in my heart that when the attorney general of the United States testified before the United States Congress that he did not lie,\u201d she said. \u201cThat being said, it was a really direct question I asked, and he was so obviously evasive. He is obviously a very smart person. He is well educated. And so I am suspicious that he was trying to evade. Obviously, he was not being direct. And one has to ask why. \u201d\n\nTwo weeks ago, on a conference call with reporters to spin the coming pivot toward emphasizing Iowa, Harris\u2019s campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez, and her communications director, Lily Adams, were asked an elemental question: Is there a policy issue that she\u2019s running on?\n\n\u201cVoters really are looking for someone who can unite the country, and unite the party\u2014that\u2019s broader than any sort of policy issue,\u201d Adams said. But if there is an issue, Adams said, it would be gun violence, and the campaign was seeing people respond to Harris\u2019s plan to use executive actions to restrict purchases if Congress wouldn\u2019t pass a bill.\n\nRead: Kamala Harris is the Jan Brady of the 2020 race\n\nNow, with the president facing constitutional prosecution, Harris told me she\u2019s ready to \u201chelp people interpret and analyze what\u2019s happening,\u201d but she\u2019s going to keep campaigning on guns, health care, and people being able to pay their bills. She went right back to the lines she\u2019d started sketching out a year ago in Iowa, regarding what people think about in the middle of the night. She has tried to define herself as someone with pragmatic solutions while her rivals in the race tack a direction she sees as overly broad or unrealistic. This is not unlike the way Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign responded to Hillary Clinton\u2019s promise of change by declaring that he was about \u201cchange we can believe in.\u201d", "description": "As President Trump lashes out at legal attacks, the senator from California sees an opportunity to remind voters that she was once a respected lawyer.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX741BC/facebook.jpg?1570060498"}
