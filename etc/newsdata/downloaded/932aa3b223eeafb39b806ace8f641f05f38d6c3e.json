It was his first summons for jury duty, The Associated Press reported.\n\nSomerville was told to come back the next day at 9 a.m. But he missed his alarm and woke up at about 11 a.m. instead, the AP reported.\n\n\u201cI woke up and I was like, \u2018Oh shoot. It\u2019s past the time,'\u201d he told local news station Fox 6.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInstead of calling the bailiff or going to the courthouse, Somerville, who lives with his grandparents, went to his afternoon job, working at after-school programs for the city of West Palm Beach Parks and Recreation Department.\n\n\u201cAt work, I was looking on my phone thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the worst case scenario that could happen?\u2019 I thought maybe I would get a fine or something like that,\u201d Somerville told the AP.\n\nPolice later came to Somerville\u2019s home, and his grandfather told him to \u201cjust go in and be honest,\u201d he told the AP.\n\n\"I overslept, for one, and I just didn't know the seriousness of it, to be honest. This is my first time ever coming to court when you told me to come. Other than that, I never been in the courthouse,\" Somerville told the judge, BuzzFeed News reported, citing a court transcript.\n\nDuring his hearing, Circuit Civil Judge John Kastrenakes said the trial had been delayed by 45 minutes because of Somerville, whose conduct \u201cimpeded the due administration of justice.\u201d Kastrenakes convicted Somerville of direct criminal contempt, handing him a 10-day jail sentence as well as 12 months probation, 150 hours of community service and an order to write an apology letter, Fox 6 reported.\n\n\u201cThey handcuffed me in the courtroom after that,\u201d Somerville told the AP. During his jail sentence, he spent his time writing and praying.\n\nSomerville\u2019s public defender appealed the sentence, and a judge on Friday lowered his sentence to three months probation and 30 hours of community service. As part of his probation, Somerville will also have to report to the jury office weekly to deliver a 10-minute speech \u2014 each of which will count for three hours of community service \u2014 about why jury duty is important, Fox 6 reports.\n\n\u201cIt hurts, but it\u2019s a lesson learned,\u201d said Somerville. \u201cIt could have been worse.\u201d", "description": "A 21-year-old Florida man who overslept for jury duty was sentenced to\u00a0jail for 10 days and said his life will \u201cnever be the same again.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/somervilledeondre.fox6_.100419_0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
