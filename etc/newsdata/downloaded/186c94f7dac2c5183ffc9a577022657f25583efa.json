That means only drinking pumpkin spice lattes, wearing shades of red, brown, and orange, and snuggling under knitted blankets (okay, this last one might be uncomfortable \u2026 unless you\u2019re in a freezing, AC-blasted mall or cinema).\n\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced that autumn has begun, check out these super-seasonal books, films, poems, art, and songs, as chosen by us. You\u2019ll be reaching for the pumpkin spice in no time!\n\nAt school, we used to sing a hymn called Autumn Days, which is all about the things we see in autumn, like clouds that take on the shapes of familiar faces, and the dew on the grass in the chilly English mornings. This is a very autumnal song for me, because it reminds me of putting on my school uniform, bundling up in a big, puffy coat, and meeting up with my friends on the playground after the long summer months.\n\nGinny Wong, Sub-editor\n\nWhat puts you in a cosy fall mood?

There are a lot of workers rushing to harvest the wheat in the dying hours of the day. Though the colours are muted, there is still a sense of urgency created by the setting sun in the background. It seems like a metaphor for life itself: in the last hours of useful light before darkness descends, you have to hustle to get all your work done.\n\nJamie Lam, Special projects editor\n\nEscape from concrete jungle fever in Hong Kong's best urban parks\n\nGreen Day\u2019s Wake Me Up When September Ends always reminds me of autumn. As a diehard Green Day fan, I often play this song on repeat when October rolls around. It\u2019s about being caught between the inability to move on from the past, and the reality of knowing that nothing can last forever. It often makes me feel a bit sad, and prompts me to reflect on what I\u2019ve done throughout the year as we enter the last few months.\n\nJoanne Ma, Reporter\n\nRobert Frost\u2019s Nothing Gold Can Stay perfectly captures the changing of seasons and transience of life; all things fade in time, and that is what makes them beautiful. The lines \u201cSo dawn goes down to day/Nothing gold can stay\u201d remind us to take a moment to pause and appreciate the precious things and people in life before they are gone.\n\nDoris Wai, Multimedia producer\n\nAutumn is a season when leaves turn red and begin to fall. To me, it is also a symbol of growing old \u2013 in the \u201cautumn\u201d of our lives, our memories begin to fade and we may start to forget what it was like to feel young and full of life. All of this is perfectly captured in the music video for Regina Spektor\u2019s Eet. In it, the singer tries to hit the backspace, or \u201cEet\u201d button of a typewriter, in the hope that it will take her back in time, as she sings: \u201cIt\u2019s like forgetting the words to your favourite song/You can\u2019t believe it/You were always singing along/It was so easy and the words so sweet/You can\u2019t remember/You try to feel the beat\u201d.\n\nNicola Chan, Reporter\n\nThe snuggliest way to celebrate autumn.

The record is autumn leaves, maple lattes, and knitted scarves in sonic form. It\u2019s also a heartbreak record, which makes it perfect to listen to while taking long solitary walks on rainy afternoons. If you love the whole cosy, coppery, tartan-y autumn aesthetic, you need this album in your life.\n\nCharlotte Ames-Ettridge, Sub-editor\n\nYour student guide to Montreal - everything you need to know about living, studying, and working in this friendly Canadian city\n\nThe film Back to the Future is set in October, which by default makes it an autumn movie. But what truly makes it autumnal is the fact that it begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) screaming \u201cI\u2019m late for school!\u201d and dashing off, in one of the best movie openings of all time. That line probably summed up my school life.\n\nWong Tsui-Kai, Web reporter\n\nI never need an excuse to reread Jane Austen\u2019s classic Pride and Prejudice, but the fact that it opens in late September (Mr Bingley comes to the village \u201cbefore Michaelmas\u201d, which is September 29) makes it particularly suitable to read at this time of year.\n\nBesides, there\u2019s a sort of back-to-school feeling about reading classic literature, but in a good way when it\u2019s a book you love.\n\nKarly Cox, Deputy editor\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "The season may be fleeting in Hong Kong, but you can make the feeling last", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock_1501435184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
